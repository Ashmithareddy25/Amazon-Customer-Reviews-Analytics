B0000DZEA1|5.0|This music is incredible. I enjoy every minute of it. It's great music to read to, to game to, to relax to. The vocals, when present, are sang incredibly well.<br />I highly reccomend this to anyone who enjoys the movies or books.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I got this app in the afternoon and I tried it out because I was stressed and it worked! Never in my wildest dreams would I have thought that meditation would work for me! I stress to the point of I go into a depression and or I would get sick. so for those of you whom are really stressed out try it and you'll probably love it !
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I really like this calculator app. It is easy to use and keeps a history of what you are calculating.
0439023521|5.0|This book is amazing!  Really draws you in - I couldn't put it down.  Definitely my favorite trilogy.  Worth reading whether you've seen the movie or not.
B0063GORYU|4.0|love this app but the feature that automatically moves a card or stack sometimes puts it in illogical places that no one would.  still play it quite a bit!
0307730697|5.0|A while back I put up a post that included information about the release this book. I finally pried the book out of my husband's hands and got the chance to read it myself. All I can say about this book is WOW!!!  Adam Brown was an amazing man and his stories were so interesting and encouraging. From beginning to end, this book kept my attention and the stories kept me interested and engaged. This book brought out a range of emotions from happiness to grief; I laughed aloud multiple times, but also found myself in tears near the end. I literately just closed the cover of this book and am still digesting all that I read so I  honestly can't really say anything else about this book except that you NEED to read it. As soon as I read the last word, I knew that I need to let you all know about it!<br /><br />To learn more about Adam and find out how to get your own copy, go to [...]<br /><br />Disclaimer: Although I was provided free copies of this book, it was not in exchange for this review.  I really think this is an awesome book and would recommend it to anyone!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This book is so poorly written that it was hard to finish. The storyline is awful, completely predictable and just uninteresting. I bought it because of the media fuzz, but I would have rather spent those 10 dollars on a drink with my friends. Don't waste your money, it is really not worth it.
B006RUJST6|5.0|I was on the edge about this book, the description made it seem a little dull but it doesn't do it justice! I read this in two days, I couldn't put it down! The story is so realistic, something that can happen to anyone. The characters seem like people you know and it's the most heart-warming book I've ever read. Definitely on my favorites list!
0066620996|5.0|This book serves many audiences well.  This book is perfect for the new executive in an established, successful company that is looking for a path ahead.<br /><br />It is fantastic for the rising manager developing his or her leadership and management style, and the book is a great read for the casual, business aficionado.<br /><br />The book is very well written and full of great common sense approaches to leading a business.  One of the keys is the \\"hedgehog\\" concept.  Companies should focus on one central concept and be the best at it rather than diluting their time, talent, treasure, and passion amongst a variety of areas.<br /><br />One of the other central points is that businesses are most successful when they focus on the intersection of three sets: things that their employees love to do, things that are valued by their customers, and things that their employees do very well.<br /><br />It is genius!<br /><br />Another critical point that the book makes is that good companies do not become great companies overnight.  It takes time, like a flywheel building up momentum.<br /><br />And, the list of great concepts in the book goes on and on.<br /><br />I cannot recommend this book enough.  If you are a manager or just interested in strategic leadership, you need to read this book now.<br /><br />In service,<br /><br />Rich
B007QNRMUU|3.0|It's true.  I like some of the songs.  Others make me wish he'd return to his earlier styles.  I usually listen to his albums for months at a time.  Not this one.  I listened 3 times and have removed several songs from my play list.
B001RHPJBU|4.0|This compilation fell just short of 5 stars for me. \\"Don't Lose My Number\\", \\"I Don't Care Anymore\\" and \\"I Missed Again\\" are mistakenly left off. \\"Separate Lives\\", \\"True Colors\\" and \\"Both Sides Of The Story\\" could have been left off to make this one of the greatest greatest hits packages ever by a solo artist. Still fantastic though.<br /><br />And for 99 cents, who's really complaining? I got this on CD from BMG or Columbia House back in the day and still have it.
B00701L5XS|2.0|I got this game because I thought you were trying to undo the knots (I didn't read the description)  if you did this game just shows you different types if knots
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is awesome.  Anyone who is good at puzzles should get this game. It is the funnest game ever.
0307266303|5.0|I could not put this book down. It is written so well. I even went out an bought some 5 fingered shoes! Highly recommend this book to anyone.
0792838912|5.0|I watched this movie for the first time when I was sixteen and am now thirty two. I loved it then for different reasons, it was hot and left me feeling haunted. Now that I'm an adult,  I see the sad beauty to it. Mickey and Kim are fabulous and I can't imagine anyone else in these roles. I adore the eighties movies \\"feel \\" as well, although I know it was made back then. I think it stands the test of time and holds up well. The sex is hot, yes, but its the emotion that makes the story so addictive. The last scene makes me cry every time, no joke. I highly recommend this movie!!!!
B0085776BG|5.0|I saw this in the movie theater and I could not believe my eyes.  The picture, the scene, the acting, it was all great.  This movie really pulls you in and you feel the anger, frustration and glory that these men all felt.  I highly reccomend this movie.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I am surprised about all the negative reviews. I was uncertain and it doesn't glitches on my kindle fire. I think this is a fun game but I thought I was getting Oregon trail on an actual trail ( the other version)  but this one is just as good
B007J4T2G8|5.0|when i first heard of the book on \\"the view\\" i didn't give it a second thought.  but hearing from co-workers and family i decided to give it a try.  \\"loved it\\". i have never read a book by a first time author that has me so enraptured.  she makes you care about the characters and curious to find out what happens next and you only wish the best for the main characters.  could there possibly be a fourth.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|It's a long read, but it was worth it! I really cared about the characters and felt like I was in their world with them.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I really enjoy this game! its a simple concept that can not only be fun for all ages its free! I love it and its making me never want to put my kindle down! two thumbs up!!

034580404X|5.0|I love the books so far, but got through page 374 in \\"....Darker\\" and pages 375-406 are missing. Have no number to call or email so I can continue with these pages. Going to skip them I guess. Emailed the publisher, but haven't heard anything.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I had heard from my grand kids that it was a good book and Papa should read it. Well I took their advice and read it. It was enjoyable and a fun quick read. I also ended up buying the other two books of the series and they were enjoyable as well. I am a senior and I was worried about it being silly and not worth my time, well I was wrong, I liked it.
B004LSO6YI|5.0|This is one of the BEST Lesbian Movies I've seen. I mean yeah there's a little cheesy-ness in it (as with any Romance movie), but the storyline is interesting, both characters are endearing, the chemistry is palpable, and the love scenes are HOT... NOT a movie you want to watch with your kids in the room! ;)
B007R3AZNK|4.0|There is little to add to what has already been said by the reviewers who preceded me. It is not surprising that \\"Driving Towards The Daylight\\" has received lots of 5 or 4 stars comments as it is a very nice, solid rock/blues CD. However, having said that, it sounds to me more like an album from a \\"singer\\" rather than the effort from (at least in my opinion) one of the top three blues guitar players in the business, I would have loved to ear more guitar playing/soloing and less singing. Sadly still miles behind \\"Blues Deluxe\\" that in my opinion is still Joe's best effort to date (Joe, will we ever have the joy to listening to \\"Blues Deluxe 2\\"?).
B007X4ECLY|4.0|First off, Lockout is not meant to be taken seriously. It is a fun action sci-fi movie that breaks the boundaries of what it physically possible. Remember when you were a kid playing with your little action figures in the sandbox, well that is how they designed Lockout. They forgot about what is real and what can actually be done and simply had fun.<br /><br />Guy Pearce is hilarious and teamed up with Maggie Grace the laughs just keep rolling. It is an action, sci-fi, comedy that is amazingly well crafted if you can take your thinking cap off and just have fun. There are a few plot twists, but nothing you didn't see coming. While Lockout doesn't really bring anything completely new to the table, it is very entertaining and well worth multiple viewings.<br /><br />Due to mixed reviews I did not expect much, but Lockout really impressed me with its style and fast paced action. Other reviews has said that the special effects looked terrible, that is simply because of the style. One thing Lockout has is style and solid direction and cinematography. They knew what they were doing with this movie and they pulled it off perfectly.<br /><br />The PQ & AQ were great on Blu-ray and while the special features were lacking, it is still a solid Blu-ray release.<br /><br />Recommended!
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Good for hours of fun. Kids of all ages can play this free game. Even my 5 year old likes it

0486474917|5.0|Read: 6/09, 8/10, 7/12<br />Rate: 5/5<br /><br />6/09: Adventures of Sherlock Holmes is the third book of the series, consisting of twelve sensational cases. Actually, I find two of these cases (The Red-Headed League and A Case of Identity) to be quite simplistic that I am surprised at Dr. Watson for not making a good educated guess from the outset. It is that moment in each case that I began to suspect of Dr. Watson's intelligence. Once again, in each of the cases, the story is thrilling, and the writing of Arthur Conan Doyle is beautiful. However, each of the progressing case has a distinctively formulaic feel: some small talk or business from either or both of the main characters, a random character appears with a shocking tale, Sherlock's tendency to say, \\"It's the most interesting case I've heard in months,\\" the campaign of sleuthing without knowing the full details, the apprehension, and finally the details of how the mystery was solved with extra analysis from Sherlock. I won't say that the formulaic feel of each case is increasingly tired but rather, I had hoped the author would just mix things up a little bit. Meanwhile, in the case The Adventure of the Speckled Band, when Sherlock Holmes identified the creature as the Swamp Adder, there is no such thing as one although I thought it was a cobra based on the description of its distinctive head. All in all, Adventures of Sherlock Holmes is a can't-miss and easily beats out possibly all of the mystery books in existence.<br /><br />8/10: Sir Arthur Conan Doyle presents twelve exciting stories in Adventures of Sherlock Holmes that will have all fans of the legendary detective enthralled. Every one of the cases is unique in its own way, and in one of them, Sherlock Holmes is beaten by a woman. In two cases that a reader can really solve by easily creating a valid theory after reading the facts of the case, one must question Dr. Watson's intelligence because he should have also done the same thing. In a third case, one can really solve it quicker than Sherlock Holmes can due to a connection in the previous case described in A Case of Identity, and he readily admits that, \\"I think, Watson, that you are now standing in the presence of one of the most absolute fools in Europe. I deserve to be kicked from here to Charing Cross.\\" However, Sherlock Holmes is a genius, and every word about the cases is thrilling to read and a pleasure. All in all, Adventures of Sherlock Holmes is a can't put down.<br /><br />7/12: While not as thrilling as The Sign of Four, Adventures of Sherlock Holmes does have staying power just like the first two stories. Arthur Conan Doyle's writing steadily improves, and the stories are as refined as ever. Several of them are quite easy to figure out, but I can't believe John Watson is incompetent. Sherlock Holmes must have a good deal of patience with him. The easiest mystery for the reader is The Man with the Twisted Lip which caused Sherlock to exclaim that he is \\"one of the most absolute fools in Europe\\" and should be kicked \\"from here to Charing Cross.\\" At least he is correct when he says, \\"Crime is common. Logic is rare.\\" That's where he makes a name for himself, and the stories are replete of it. All in all, the readers will learn a lot from Adventures of Sherlock Holmes if they take the time to sit down with it. \\"Data! Data! Data! I can't make bricks without clay,\\" he says.e, one can really solve it quicker than Sherlock Holmes can due to a connection in the previous case described in A Case of Identity, and he readily admits that, \\"I think, Watson, that you are now standing in the presence of one of the most absolute fools in Europe.

B005K17RU0|3.0|Good app but the radar portion will lock the kindle fire up to where you have to reset the machine. Everything else works well.
B004KAB4I8|5.0|Great artist, and better teacher than any I had in school.<br />Has great step by step instructions. Each new step is done in red so you know what to add.<br />The only thing missing is detailed instructions for how to color/shade, but considering it is for beginning/mid level artist I wasn't really really expecting any.<br /><br />Anyways my kid loved it, and it even got me back into drawing.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|OK, I admit, I had to see what all the hoopla was about, so I downloaded these books to my e-reader. I am still trying to figure out why they've shot to the tops of best seller lists. These poorly written books glorify both physical and mental abuse, yet they seem to have captivated millions of people as \\"erotica\\". Personally, I find nothing arousing about the idea of being hit or controlled. Are smart, well-written works of literature so hard to come by now or has the collective IQ of our society simply taken a nosedive in recent years? If you have a discerning taste in literature, these are NOT the tales for you.
0345803485|3.0|Oh what to say...<br />the story itself was good but the writing was terrible! So repetitive!  And the main character was made out to be so naive and questioning obvious things. I get that she is inexperienced but come on, she is graduating college! And as for the sexy stuff, that part was ok, good enough to entertain a bored housewife. (That is not bad nor good)<br />  I do believe that this is the best of the 3 and I had already spent the money on the 2nd one but a couple pages into it I regretted even trying to read it! First book ever that I just skimmed through (that's for another review though)<br />  Bottom line, I gave it 3 stars because it was a good book written by a bad author and to be honest, for some reason I couldn't put this one down! I just don't understand what all the rave is about though. Seriously!  And for the record I only sampled (on my kindle) the third just to see if it got better, not a chance! So no sale here for that one,  we all can anticipate the ending anyways cuz this book seems predictable. Correct me if I'm wrong about the troubling happily ever after.<br /><br />My last words: OH MY
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Oh my.  At my age, (way past 65), didn't think there was much more to learn.  The writing may be less than Shakespeare, but who could put this one down once they got started?  The four stars aren't for the writing, but for the entertainment.  These sexy people never sleep, and neither do I since I started turning the pages.
B006OCM0G0|1.0|everytime I go to play it, it always says application restaurant story cant be opened. it aggregates me like crazy. You never really get to play it. Don't waste your time or memory

B007L3BMGA|4.0|I found the books to be a bit of light fun and basically entertaining.  It was the book that everyone was reading and as such, I then too read it.  Ana is a bit nauseating at times and very repetitive ... but hey, I wasnt reading it for the literary value!  At least there is an attempt at a storyline between the sex scenes.
B005LAII1C|3.0|Probably everyone remembers their first R rated movie (Smokey and the Bandit for me). This movie would be a perfect first R rated movie for an adolescent boy to sneak into. Filled with potty humor, farts, poops, spankings, and gratuitous swearing. Shows some body parts and alludes to sexual activity without actually showing it.<br /><br />This movie has its clever moments. After the teddy bear magically comes to life, everyone can see him. And yet after the initial fanfare, everyone loses interest, except for the occasional person on the street who wants to take a cell phone picture with him, so the bear has to get a real job haha. The movie also had good CGI and some neat effects, like when Ted appeared as a guest on the Tonight Show with Johnny Carson :-)<br /><br />The storyline is very predictable. It's pure male fantasy that a beautiful and successful, career-oriented, much younger woman would fall for an unreliable, pot-smoking, car rental clerk whose interests range from sitting on the couch, to watching TV, to drinking beer, and who loves spending time with his bear-buddy more than his woman.<br /><br />The movie would have been much better with a more talented, comedian as a main character, e.g., Seth Rogen has enough appeal, acting ability, and personality to pull it off and with some well placed ad-libbing could have made this a very good if not great movie. Mark Wahlberg is too low-key and vanilla for this role, and definitely is not looking 35. Though to his credit, he does do a believable Boston accent, which isn't easy, and has a nice chemistry with Ted.

0307716546|5.0|I've been struggling to finish all the books I've started lately, but of all of them, this was the one that beat the rest to the finish line. Afterwards first attracted me in the library, where it was sitting on display in the front--it's cover grabbed me. The book is beautiful to look at, and the pages inside are equally captivating.<br /><br />Afterwards is a uniquely narrated novel, told from the point of Gracie--mother of two--as if she's speaking to her husband. She starts many lines with \\"You\\", so just know that \\"you\\" is her husband. When Gracie and her daughter suffer injuries trying to escape from a burning building, their school, they awake to find themselves out of their bodies and in the hospital. Faced with the reality of what's happened to them, that neither one is really conscious and they can't communicate with anyone around them, Grace and Jenny have to rely on each other for support.<br /><br />It's more complicated than that, however, because early on we learn that this fire was no accident. Barely 50 pages in, secrets start to reveal themselves and more questions arise, as well as some chilling occurrences that seem to imply that Jenny and Gracie might still be in danger, despite having escaped the fire. Of course, their bodies are struggling for survival in the hospital, but another danger lurks around them still.<br /><br />I found this novel to be just that more chilling due to the fact that I'm a mom. Gracie is a typical, would-do-anything-for-her-kids type of mother. In that way, her thoughts are easy to understand and relate to. There is no fear like seeing your own child in danger. Lupton is clearly a talented writer, too. The story was constructed with skill, the characters well developed, and her style of writing is smooth and fresh.<br /><br />This novel absolutely comes recommended by me, but especially if you're looking for a good, intense summer read. If you enjoyed The Lovely Bones, The Time Traveler's Wife, or Tana French novels, I'd definitely recommend this one.d definitely recommend this one.
B00785P2QC|5.0|the game makers have done a great job with the upgrades for this game. always new goals to try and achieve. awesome game. no problems!!!

B005LFQRTC|5.0|Keep up the Great Work.... One of the best ever!!!!!!!!!! I Love the DVD!!!!! Still waiting for Season 2 :-)
0345803485|2.0|Very predictable and naive. Book definitely not for kids for obvious reason, however, for grown-ups it has naive not well thought trough story line and details. Lacks realistic touch to it. Climaxing on very first time and absolutely every time thereafter, really?... Realism and story line getting worse in 2nd and 3rd book.<br /><br />Giving 2 stars instead of 1 just for the idea. Interesting idea bad implementation. On the other hand the author has never intended her work to be among best sellers. Have to admit promoters did a good job. Most readers including myself have read it out of curiosity to check out why it is so popular in turn adding to its popularity...
B003K1EYM6|5.0|Product is awesome. Just what I was looking for. Works perfectly with the ipad1. Glad I purchased it. Item come with 2 adapters.<br /><br />Definitely would suggest to a friend.
B0041I0N9A|5.0|This was a christmas present for my husband he enjoys putting these sets together he has several ohter large lego sets the cost was a bit high, but most of the sets are comparable for the pieces.  The set is truely more for a show piece not a realy easy to play with toy for a kiddo, unless the kiddo is older and won't feel frustrated if something comes apart during play.

B005D9MUWY|5.0|I have tried all of the free keyboards, and a few paid ones.  I have tried to replace this one between bug fixes.  When this thing is learning how you type, and predicting, it is the best app I have ever had.  It used to be smaller, and I don't need the updates really, but all in all, it is worth it no matter what.  There are a handful of phrases that I don't even have to type.<br /><br />  The absolute best feature, is that you do not have to hit the correct key to get it to start guessing, you can miss and still keep going.  Some say they offer this, but none get it right like this one.  With the predicting, and letting you miss, this is the fastest keyboard there is.  I have tried swype and all of the others, and I am experienced with this one,swype, and message ease, and this one I am told to slow down often.  I am not bragging, just saying, if you don't have a physical keyboard and like to post/text a lot, this is the way to go.<br /><br />  In closing I was in this for the beta,and paid only .99 when it was first released, but it is well worth the 3.99.

B002BWP49C|5.0|I love the twilight series, and was very pleased with Breaking Dawn Part I. I can't wait for Part II to come out. I loved all the twilight movies so far, but I would have to say this was my all time favorite. I won't spoil it for you, but this is a must see for all of us twilight fans out there. I gave it five stars.<br />You won't be disappointed.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B002BWP49C The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part I (Two-Disc Special Edition)]]
B008FYZIVY|5.0|This series is undoubtedly going to be as long-lived a hit as Upstairs, Downstairs. It ranks in the British perfection class with Foyle's War. It's a Period Costume Drama series with plenty of mega-stars. The magnificent performance of Maggie Smith in a less-than leading role shines through every time she's on the screen (very often), even when she has no lines. Her facial delivery is comic. A paragraph could be written for almost every cast member, each seem to feed off the other in making this a remarkable period drama that takes the viewer back to the era, like it is real.<br /><br />Robert Crawley (Hugh Bonneville) is the man behind the estate, but it is Mr. Carson (Jim Carter), the butler, who keeps the house and social lives moving. There are 12 cast members that have a role in EVERY episode. Many more who miss just one or two. You fall in love with each in their own way, each a vital role in the make-up of this large family and servants. Not an issues is untouched, since every episode blends threads of intrigue, love, and history.<br /><br />The home, the countryside scenes, even WWI segments, the costumes, the sets, the music, the props, the...well, it's easier to say there is nothing about this series my wife and I have been even remotely disappointed with. If you don't own the original released DVDs this is a must buy. And with the rest of the world, you will then be awaiting season three, knowing it will be SIX-star worthy as well. Created and written by Julian Fellowes who last acted in Monarch of the Glen (another keeper). He and his daughter combined in a book, also a must own for Downton Abbey fans.<br /><br />I give this UK DVD series a 6-star super recommendation.
B000MG1ZG0|5.0|The DVDA 24/96 remixes for this album are gorgeous. While the remixes made some of their early stuff a bit different this album improves immensely. In fact, the actual true sound of the band in all the remixes is just beyond awesome. Exactly like they should be in studio without the Roth producing. I still like the old masters but these new ones are special....
B006RUJST6|5.0|This was a great, fast read.  Great characters and story and I thoroughly enjoyed both this and the 2nd book, Point of Retreat.  DYING for the 3rd installment.<br /><br />The advice I wish I'd had?  To listen to the Avett brother's music as I was reading.  Each chapter has a quote from an Avett Brothers song and you can tell that the author was inspired by their deep, touching lyrics.  I listened to some of their music (after I had already obsessively read both books in like 3 days) and I am over the moon for the Avett Brothers!!  My suggestion would be to check out some of their music- I'd suggest Head Full of Doubt, I and Love and You and The Laundry Room and see what you think.  If you're moved by their music and/or lyrics, you might enjoy reading the book and listening to the songs as you go.  I'm loving doing that!<br /><br />Enjoy and THANK YOU Colleen for introducing me to my new favorite folk group!!  &lt;3
B002MQYOFW|5.0|After fighting against reading the book for weeks I finally gave in and to my surprise I LOVED IT!!! The book was all but boring. There was a ton or diversity and the way that Mrs Collins had so many characters that were completely different but at the same time so much alike. Everytime you thought you knew what was going to happen there would be a twist. Just when you thought it was all over something would change. It was an emotional and suspenseful book full of details and excitement.<br />Katniss seems to be a character that you love and hate all at the same time. There are so many conflicting thoughts and emotions when dealing with the her and the other characters of this book. In my opinon it is a fascinating way to entertain and keep your readers on their toes!!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Good game...  A little different than router but the graphics are much more pleasing!  Thanks for this game which i will waste much time on
B007P6VLRS|2.0|I don't know what the Smashing Pumpkins, up to about half of Machina I+II, were, exactly, but this is not them.<br /><br />Seriously, Billy, you need to edit your lyrics. For the love of god. Nice songtitles. 43.28% awful ***ing lyrics. I don't know what else to say. This is more towards his solo album than anything else and I don't even like it near as much as that. I just don't feel these guys have any good taste left in them. Zwan was too much for me. Zeitgeist was way too produced but had some great songs. This however.... Just start a new band. Going through the lyrics I see none of the stuff that qualifies as well written. It's all passable and nothing even close to his start up until the Adore days, which have some of the most well written lyrics in rock. Whatever, you can download this on a torrent. Billy has enough money.
B0088RQ4X4|5.0|I have no idea why the critics lambasted this movie, I can only assume they were huffing glue or something. John Carter is an awesome old-school romp that fans of Edgar Rice Burroughs both new and old can enjoy.<br /><br />John Carter has an excellent cast and a screenplay that was co-authored by Michael Chabon, so for once the story isn't one tired Hollywood cliche after another, but a ripping yarn that reminded me favorably of Raiders of the Lost Ark or Star Wars. John Carter is as resourceful as Indiana Jones, and Thars Tharkas is so finely drawn that he nearly steals the show.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor, ignore the critics and give this a try, I'm glad I did!

B004JN1D2I|5.0|I'm soon done with the fourth book on my Kindle, and it has been a real journey to faraway lands and ages for me, I really enjoyed it. The books are long but never boring, there are way too many characters to follow for that. If you don't like fantasy or a large amount of names and characters, this is not for you. But these books come with maps and a description of each character and their relationships in the back, so it makes it a lot easier to follow.<br /><br />Warning though, there are (so far) no happy endings here. And I believe that the sex scenes are not so racy as in the tv series. Other things happen in the books apart from sex, is what I'm saying. Blood and gore and killings, for example :P<br /><br />Have fun with it!

B0034G4ORC|5.0|This movie is brilliantly directed to capture the confusion and sudden surprises<br />of life on the battlefield. Often, the shots are so brief that you're not certain<br />what you're seeing, just as our warriors are. The script does deal a tiny bit in<br />cliche, but the whole thing surges along with such power that you scarcely have<br />time to think about that. Also, with so many soldiers and so much action, you<br />don't really get to know anyone except Aaron Eckhart's character. Still, the whole<br />thing is thrilling, a great blend of war film and alien-invasion film.
B00701L5XS|5.0|Very fun, simple and I could spend hours doing them. Well done guys. I don't like to have to type a lot for a review.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|My children have this game on their ipods and love it.  I added it to my kindle firecand I love it too.  The one thing I don't like is the game wanting you to connect with friends to visit other villiages.  the only other villiages I would like to connect to belong to my children but they aren't on social networks and are too young to join one.  Frankly I want to keep it that way for as long as possible!
B001EAWMGA|2.0|Where to begin? I love 'B' movies but this one is just too damn bad, from the poor script to the acting.<br />The poor green screening, CGI, you name it, it was horrible.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|A really good game. The ice age characters are all in it and it has the idea from every movie of ice age. I see lots of people complaining that it is impossible to get out of the game, but its really easy ( just go to the option button on the menu bar and click it and you will see you can leave the game) . Anyway it is a very fun game and I like it. :D
030758836X|5.0|There is an old saying that no one really knows what goes on in another person's life and this is especially true of Nick and Amy's marriage. Amy's surprise disappearance on their 5th wedding anniversary sets this story out on a suspenseful search on what happened to her. I don't want to disclose too much as to ruin the book for everyone. I'll just say that there are many twists and turns. It's much more than a suspenseful novel. The pychological aspects add a great depth and make it multidimensional.<br />  One of the best reads of 2012.
0307279189|5.0|So I received this book as a birthday present.<br /><br />The person who gave it to me rationalized that the book might be able to accomplish what he failed to do -- persuade me to get out and get running.<br /><br />You see, I'm don't run.  I'll hike to any destination, but run?  Forgetaboutit.<br /><br />Yet the book was able to convey the spirit and passion of extreme runners - ultra marathoners who run for days at a time in such a way that I didn't read about these runners' stories and think \\"they're nuts\\".  I started rooting for them.<br /><br />I enjoyed the base story - that of the author seeking answers to his running pain problem and that of the main protagonist's quest to create the ultimate race among running greats.<br /><br />But what I enjoyed more were the forays into our ancestral history - hypotheses for why we were made for running, nutritional facts on superfoods like chia seeds, and the history of Nike and its impact on the sport of running.<br /><br />I enjoyed how everything wove into a cohesive and riveting tale.  I read through the book in a day, and at the end of it, found the book both touching and thought provoking.<br /><br />As for getting me to run?  Well it didn't motivate me any better on the treadmill the next day, but I'm certainly willing to get out and try trail running again and I'm definitely interested in seeing how I can improve my running form --<br /><br />Maybe tomorrow.<br /><br />:p

0143119680|2.0|I really wanted to like this book. NPR gave it a glowing review and it sounded wonderful. But reading about every single minute of every single day was so tedious; exactly what was worn, how everyone smelled, what they ate and drank at every meal, descriptions of the furniture and buildings, and on and on. The lead character starts out an independent, athletic, smart woman and ends up having to be carried everywhere by her overbearing love interest (and calling each other \\"husband\\" and \\"wife\\" instead of using names is just creepy). Yes, details make books much more interesting but this was way too much. Lots of other problems with this book. Pacing was off. Cartoon-like, one-dimensional bad guys. (Who captures someone and then leaves them unguarded to be rescued? Straight out of the bad guy no-no handbook.) Huge blind spot about love interest's source of \\"food\\" even when the main character acknowledges that he's just consumed human blood. I liked the beginning and the over arcing idea but was just irritated by the end.
0141195851|4.0|We all know what kind of a text we are getting here, so instead I will talk about the physical features.  The binding on this and the cover are beautiful. I love the foiled look of the snow flakes. The pages are standard book pages, not glossy and a bit rough to the touch, compared to say printer paper, but not at all the yellow-ish cheep stuff you see in some books. The cover has a canvasy/fabric feel. It made a very nice gift and I was happy to get it.
B005NFJAZS|5.0|Mason City Iowa, where he was born, has built a shrine to Meredith Willson (Yes, his name DOES have 2--count `em--2 ll's).  And would you believe it?  Dunno where they got `em but this shrine actually has 76 real PLAYABLE trombones mounted to the ceiling.  And a representation of Harold Hill`s music store (Well, he had to do SOMETHING after he settled down, right?)  AND that foul old-timey pool parlor.  Plus many other Meredith Willson treasures, including tributes to his other musicals (like \\"The Unsinkable Molly Brown\\") and a gift shop where, years ago, I bought 2 red T-shirts with the legend \\"You got TROUBLE!\\" emblazoned on them AND the original \\"Music Man\\" DVD.<br /><br />What no one has mentioned here is that Harold Hill was not his real name.  It was Gregory.  Gregory WHAT we will never know, although Buddy Hackett called him \\"Greg\\" at least once in the movie.  I wonder what Marian called him after the wedding?  And speaking of Hackett, on TV, he once said that he did so many re-takes while dancing \\"Shippopi\\", he was \\"shippooped\\".<br /><br />I have nothing but praise for the transfer of the stage play to the screen, even if Frank Sinatra or Cary Grant, didn't play Hill.  In fact, I'm sure the movie brought us closer to Willson's REAL characters than sitting in the balcony of the play ever could.  And I never saw Barbara Cook sing the role, so in my mind, Marian Paroo will always be Shirley Jones, although she WAS a very convincing prostitute in \\"Elmer Gantry\\".  Makes you wonder what ACTUALLY went on between her and Charlie, the anvil salesman.<br /><br />Of course, it took ALL the players to make the play but in my mind, it would have been a totally different movie, without Robert Preston.  (Ya don't believe me?  Just watch the Made-for-TV thing with Matthew Broderick! He does his best but.....)  No one is Harold (Gregory) Hill but Robert Preston.  He probably did it so often on Broadway, he DREAMED it.  And of course, Willson would not allow the movie to be made without Preston.<br /><br />So anyone without a copy of this movie--DVD or Blu-Ray--does not have a complete library of musicals.  Don't worry about the minor glitches carped about in the reviews here.  JUST BUY IT and enjoy.  BECAUSE, if you are a fan of Broadway/Hollywood musicals, YOU WILL!!<br /><br />It's sad but \\"They just don't make `em like that, any more!!\\"

B0033RT7RY|3.0|what really kills me is during the last credits the \\"big lie\\" is put out there once again.  it comes in many forms.  this time it's the so called 'gospel of thomas'. it is like MANY other 1st and 2nd century gnostic belief systems that were condemned by the early church fathers and correctly so.  it (the gospel of thomas) essentially promulgates and encourages the idea that an individual Christian 'leader' of a specific sect has the ability to gain insights or enlightments that can exceed or go beyond Christ's teachings.  so you have people walking around claiming they knew what Jesus REALLY meant, 'cause they saw it in a dream, etc.  like 'god was a simpleton and created the universe badly' kind of nursery material.  that's actually one of the beliefs that one such 'christian' group had.  and to imply the church, i.e. evil greedy individuals who have power over people and won't give it up (by belief in the 'sayings of jesus' per the 'gospel of thomas' or other apocryphal materials) is a BIG LIE.  the church has always (especially in the early days when the Apostles and disciple of Jesus were still living) ASK them if said information agreed with what Jesus told them or they heard him say, was how many things were decided.  Christ did not leave a book behind when he rose from the dead, but He DID leave an 'institution'(the horror!)of people consisting of his 12 Apostles and His following.  so smoke on that, producers of the 'stigmata'.  otherwise a 'just above' middle rated horror movie that can be entertaining.

B00701L5XS|3.0|I was happy to see a useful FAOTD.  I uninstalled when I learned of completely unjustified permissions.  At the very least, developers should explain why they need these permissions if there appears to be no reason for them.

1416550550|5.0|This has to be on my list of the best of the best, of all the books I have read.<br />I have not read a novel like this since I was a teen. Reminds me of the old time English authors, like Victoria Holt, I can recall Penmarric.  Those are gothic, and old time story telling. What a story teller she is.<br /><br />Part fairy tale, suspense, mystery, romance, there is a large estate on the cliffs, and a sickly young girl( reminds me a bit of Secret Garden- but that is where it ends) and a maze of a garden, so many twists and turns. I was on a rollercoaster the entire book. What a great ride, it is.<br /><br /> Usually, a novel climax happens and then it is dull, and you keep thinking get the story over.  There was so many climaxes, thinking it was over, but then there was more. The last climax did not hit you to the very end. You thought you figured it out, and realize you were wrong.<br /><br />The last time I read a book more than 400 pages was when I was a teen. I did not want to tackle this book. I am glad I did.  I read it very slowly, and took my time reading, because I wanted to savor Forgotten Garden.<br /><br />The writing was beautifully written, the story takes place early 20th century. There are so many characters, for some reason I could keep them straight. I would recommend that you have pad and pencil near by for some of you that can't keep the names and places, and time straight.<br /><br />I am not going to divulge too much because I don't want to spoil it. But, it takes in different times, places, and people.<br /><br />There is a 4 year old child left on a wharf, in Australia. How did she get there? Who was she? Why would someone leave a 4 year old child by herself on a wharf?  One man, that works at the wharf took her home, and cared for her, and he's sickly wife. When she turned 21 her father divulged the truth.  This changed the young girl's idea of who she was.  She was to be married and cancelled the wedding plans, and she became distant with her family.<br /><br />When she passed away, she left a house, on a estate and a lovely garden, to her grand daughter Cassandra. There were many unanswered questions.  The story, is from the prospective of Nell, young and old, the grandmother, and the Authoress, who was Nell's mother's friend. Cassandra, the grand daughter mainly takes place in 2005.<br /><br />There is so much to this story, but I don't want to devulge.  I read this for our book club that is meeting Monday. I am so afraid it might not be a great discussion. When I hear everyone loves a book, not much to discuss. I hope not. I can think of lots of things to discuss, IDENTITY, for example.<br /><br />I plan to read Distant Hours next. Has anyone read it, how does it compare to Forgotten Garden?  just curious. Is it as good as Forgotten Garden or a let down? My recommendation to you if you like old fashioned story telling, with fairy tales, magic, and gothic I recommend this.r family.<br /><br />When she passed away, she left a house, on a estate and a lovely garden, to her grand daughter Cassandra.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|I was turned on to these books by a professor. This is an awesome story of how child hood trauma can affect a persons life and when adults continue to abuse a child even a willing horny teenage boy the affects of that abuse will be there until thoroughly processed. It was entertaining as well and anyone going in thinking of reading it should know that it is based in BDSM. The author did a great job with the story line around the sex play
0765316994|5.0|I bought Redshirts as a book to read on an airplane.  At the time it seemed like it would be a fun spoof on the whole thing about expendable characters in sci-fi series like Star Trek, which it was.  But I was pleased to also see that it had a plot and a lot of great humor.  The book moves along at a pace which is not rushed, but it doesn't stall out or get bogged down in its self either.  Overall it is a fun novel for a genre which sometimes takes its self way too seriously.

0307388719|5.0|Probably the best account of Churchill's war leadership I've ever read. A superb blend of narrative and analysis that clearly addresses the great man's strengths and weaknesses but just as important details the military, strategic and economic constraints with which he had to wrestle. Put simply, continuing the war in 1940, or even embarking on it 1939, was one of the greatest gambles in history because the British state and its empire were simply overmatched by Germany in 1939 let alone when it was occupying most of western Europe. However, the British had some advantages and by and large Churchill was able to put them to good use. Where failures occurred it was because of the gap that existed between Churchill's overly romantic appreciation of British strength relative to the reality. But then it was this over appreciation that persuaded him to keep fighting and not come to an accomdation with Germany. Ultimately, Churchill's leadership was a considerable tour de force but then Britain's entire 200 year naval and imperial supremacy was a tour de force whose success depended on numerous factors other than the more traditional ones of land area and big battalions. Ultimately, Churchill's formula for success wasn't that different from that of the two Pitts or Lloyd George....naval supremacy and strong European or extra European allies.

B0000009SY|5.0|This album opens with a drum fill leading into a greasy shuffle underneath the narration of the Central Scrutinizer, an Orwellian nanny-bot.  From that opening fill to the end of the album, I was entranced the first time I heard this thing, and it's never worn thin after the thousands of listenings since.<br /><br />A young Vinnie Colaiuta is responsible for that nasty opening groove, and the effortless pocket of his groove and the chunky sound of his drums permeate the whole opera, even when impossible time signatures are thrown his way.  Want to learn how to make odd time--and I mean REALLY odd, not just 5/8, try 21/16--sound groovy?  This is the magnum opus of that perplexing art form.  I would rate this album 5 stars just based on Vinnie's Herculean performance, the greatest I've ever heard on a rock album in terms of technique, groove, and musicality.  Percussionist Ed Mann is staggeringly good too.  Heck, the whole band is pretty crazy.  Warren Cucurrullo can tear up a guitar, or a sitar, as well, Ike Willis has unbelieveable pipes, and Arthur Barrow is underrated among the Zappa bassists.  And then you have Mr. Zappa, who is irreplaceable as a composer, commenter, comedian, producer, and player.<br /><br />And then you add on top of that the xenochronous (only one FZ guitar solo was a studio take, on the majestic Watermelon in Easter Hay, the rest were taken from live performances) beauty of the compositions, the scatological humor punctuated by political diatribe against mommy-governments and lowest-common-denominator enterprises governing the arts (record companies and radio, looking at you)... what you have here is a classic, one of the widest-ranging creations of FZ's unprecedented career, where reggae, doo-wop, blues, and avant-garde somehow mesh together flawlessly.  This absurd opera, with songs about promiscuous Catholic Girls and sexual fetishism of kitchen appliances, lays bare and mocks the pretense of other rock opera efforts like Tommy, and manages to fit some social commentary in.<br /><br />Love it, if that's not already clear.es to fit some social commentary in.<br /><br />Love it, if that's not already clear.
B00846TTDG|5.0|This movie might be the best possible film tribute to the Americans fighting in the current conflicts. It is a collection of action scenes based on real operations, tied together by a fictional story, performed by real life warriors. As a result, you experience the most realistic modern battle scenes I have ever seen in the movies. Most war movies have at least a few scenes where the hero defies the laws of physics in accordance with some director's delusional fantasy of how combat should be. The action scenes in \\"Act of Valor\\" rely on the real skills and capabilities of Navy Seals to impress the audience rather hollywood fiction.<br />Most negative reviews comment on the poor acting. Sure, actors would have done a better job reading the script, but they could not have performed the action scenes period, and that is what this movie is about.<br />Another common criticism is the story. As was mentioned earlier, this movie is a collection of real life operations. The writers basically had to tie together unrelated true short stories into one series of connected events. Under the circumstances, I think the fictional story achieved the goal. To try and make the story more involved, (character development, ect.) or to have strayed further from the true stories would have detracted from the movie's focus.<br />A lot of people also seem to be offended by the patriotism of this movie, or accuse it of being a shameless recruiting film. Those people are confusing the act of honoring a profession and a set of values with propaganda. If you do not share those values, this movie will not change your mind, nor is that it's purpose. For those who do, they will enjoy seeing the their values and the men who follow them being honored.<br />A few other criticisms:<br />\\"The violence corrupts our youth\\"- It's rated R, if you can't control your youth, don't blame an adult movie. Also, I would argue that \\"reality\\" TV is much more corrupting.<br />\\"Filipinos are portrayed as Muslim villains but everyone knows filipinos are Catholic\\"- There are plenty of Muslim Filipinos and some of them are extremist terrorists. Also, they are not the central villain.<br />There are plenty of Hollywood War dramas out there so if you are looking for special effects and big name actors, Act of Valor is not it. If you want to see real life Navy Seals doing what hollywood can't, this one is in a league of it's own.ns but everyone knows filipinos are Catholic\\"- There are plenty of Muslim Filipinos and some of them are extremist terrorists.

B007JCP8FE|5.0|Shinedown is one of those bands that just doesn't know how to make bad music. It's not in their genes. Amaryllis comes out a little rougher than Us and Them and a little more thoughtful than Sound of Madness, making for a more mature sound.

B007SYWFRM|4.0|my son loves this game.  although. I think the items are too expensive (not real money)  I play frequently for him to make more money for him to buy things.
B003SI605K|5.0|Ever since I've read the book I've been dying to watch the movie version. This movie made me cry throughout the whole thing, it was just so beautiful. It doesn't follow the book word for word but I love the way the stories were laid out from mother to daughter; it made me understand how alike and how connected the daughters are to their mothers. I recommend that you read the book before watching the movie but either way you'll love The Joy Luck Club.
B005HSL626|5.0|You should download this game. P.S. What ever it says about the name of me it is lying. Its Liv.
0307719219|4.0|I'am not an authority in the field, but I've read a few books about this topic and I can't say anything negative about this book!! Very well written and thought out. It tackles the difficult question \\"Why Nations Fail\\" from a deep understanding of the existing literature. The book is clearly written by academics, but it's highly readable for anyone interested in the field. The author's provide interesting and original historical example from all over the world to illustrate economic growth, bust and sustainability. As mentioned by another reviewer, I think the only short coming of the book might be the fact that the authors over-rely on proof by historical examples. Overall I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the subject.
0345803507|4.0|while the beginning was boring & it had too much sex until about 50% through it.. the last half was fast paced could not put down loved it!!!! i was getting sick of the too much sex i am glad the middle swapped out a bit i was going to put it down, i WOULD LOVE a book from christans POV which see gives you a small preview of this at the end & it wanted it to go on..
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This one is very fun!  You can put thought into it WITHOUT straining your brain.  The whole point of games is to take a break/escape for a few.  . .but you don't want to just sit and flick you finger on a screen and hope \\"the ball\\" goes where you want.

B005GG0MIS|5.0|This book demonstrates how much can be accomplished by our political leaders when they put their differences aside and look for their common mission. Working with the strengths of the other person rather than the weaknesses. If only they could do this all of the time.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed this book and have recommended it to many friends.
B004LDLI0S|5.0|this is the greatest book ever written it tells the truth and nothing but the truth a really great readthat anyone can enjoy great translation by ford kindle keeps putting out great reads thanks
B0027ZCQ4E|4.0|Streamed this on a \\"family at-home movie night\\" although we had all seen it back when it debuted. Matt Damon infused his Jason Bourne with believable emotions, and in my opinion his acting ability is well showcased in this film. You have to get past the explosions and chases (one of the greatest car chase scenes ever, by the way) and watch his expressions and gestures to notice...which is probably why the movie bears rewatching. I happen to love action-adventure flicks (like \\"The Avengers,\\" need I say more?) and this will likely be near the top of my list for a long time. The only reason I hesitate to give 5 stars to this genre is the \\"suspension of disbelief\\" factor involved. But as the title says, escapism - one of the reasons people make and watch movies.
B003VANOFY|5.0|I just bought this headset because of all the great reviews it had and I must say that I also am very impressed. The surround sound is clear and loud with amazing quality. Noise cancelling is great and it is not very heavy so it doesn't really hurt my ears. The mic is clear and the voice morphing is a fun touch to mess with friends. Wireless is a nice touch with 0 noticeable lag. Love being able to walk around and still listen to music or PTT on vent while not being near the computer.<br /><br />My only concerns:<br />the headset hurts at first, needs to be broken in, but you get used to it real fast<br />sometimes the wireless crackles, but not very often<br />I wish it had more G buttons but the ones it has work great! programmable with vent and lots of other apps<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this headset. This was my first expensive set so I was worried about the quality when dropping a $100 on it but in the end it feels very worth it to me. No regrets here :)
0596007124|1.0|I would rate it a zero if I could just because I had to purchase a Kindle to read this.  The electronic version of this book is incompatible with the Amazon Cloud Reader, HP Touchpad, Motorola Xoom tablet, and Android phones.  I wish I had just bought a year subscription to Safari Online.
B0086700CM|1.0|this game is so awesome the best part is that it will never glitches and I have it on my fone
B004J4WKUQ|4.0|My son asked for this book then asked me to read it so we could share some thoughts on it. Both of us extremely enjoyed both book and discussion.
B0088RQ4X4|1.0|Seriously this sucked. The only good thing is the 48 hour rental period because it takes that long to get through it. I quit 5 times. The only reason I finished it was because I'm cheap. Also, the lead characters are ugly.
B008MEM24S|5.0|this is awesome were is my!!&iexcl;!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!PERRY IS OFF THE HOOK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Make MORE LIKE THIS thanks we enjoy and I would so recommend this
B008A1NSTG|3.0|This was a good movie and we could not believe it happened under our watchful eyes back then.<br />Sorry about BamBam but happy for mom and dad.<br />This was so eco-friendly reinforcing that we figured out that was why we hadn't heard about the movie before. Too much politics and over-the-top statements about the environment. But if you like whales it has a happy ending.

0062206281|4.0|So after two massive novels, creating the atmospheric reality of Barcelona and the Cemetery of Forgotten books.  It is no wonder that Carlos Ruiz Zafon came back with a much thinner output this time.  It is actually the bridge between [[ASIN:0143034901 The Shadow of the Wind]] and [[ASIN:B006YKK3MK The Angel's Game]].  The story line ties up some loose ends and nicely puts things in context of each other.  But alas, the bridge is actually a kind of a tease.  This is the story of Fermin Romero de Torres, the erstwhile sidekick to the main protagonist of the first novel, Daniel Sempere.<br /><br />Fermin's story is the vehicle by which Ruiz Zafon ties the two segments together.  I must say the story is quite worthy of it's own book.  Ruiz Zafon's skills at stirring the emotions and conjuring Barcelona of the early Franco years are masterful and does transport us to that long ago place.  It brings to the surface all of our romantic notions of  what it was like to live in Spain at that time.  And Fermin's story, is quite spell binding, although not really strong enough to stand on a massive tome of his own.  So this thinner book is a perfect vehicle.  yet I do feel somewhat cheated because I was awaiting a rollicking romp much like the first book.  the Angel Game was less favored by myself due to the phantasmagorical turns it took.<br /><br />Ruiz Zafon could have continued with the story beyond just telling the story of Fermin.  he could have gone on to tell the story that he really wants to tell: the continuing saga; instead, he teases us coyly and gets our hopes up for the next installment of the further adventures into the Cemetery of Forgotten books.  All I can say is, this title has somewhat forestalled my hunger, much like a nice set of tapas, but I am still hungry for the main course, and it had better be good.
B006AZZPCM|2.0|Well, it started ot fine. I downloaded two songs, and then it stopped working. :( I really don't like how it is incompatible with the Kindle Fire. So it's an ify app for me. Try it out yourself though! (:
B007PTJOV0|4.0|I got this app cause it looked cute to me but when I played some it wasn't just cute it was really challenging and I know some of the other comments say its just like Mario it is but its cause Mario was such an amazing game they got inspired from it.
B00760BPOC|5.0|A great read. Story flowing better than in the previous book. Makes you want to read more.Some interesting plot twists that I didn't see coming.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I loved this book.  The narrator is Death and he tells a compelling story of a young German girl, during the years leading up to and during World War II. We all know the horrors that occurred in Germany during this time period, but this book offers a touching perspective that really makes you think.  It is well written and imaginative.  I highly recommend this book.
B008MEM24S|1.0|its a waste of money if there trying to get people to buy it atleast make it free for a couple of months then bring the prices and its just like where's my water
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Thank you for keeping it simple and neat!  It's perfect on my Kindle Fire. My eyes are not as good as they used to be and this app really helps!

B004KD5TQI|5.0|Best action movie I have seen sith a great cast in some time.  I recomend this to all to see.  Please share with all your friends.
B008645YEE|1.0|This album was a waste of time. Zimmer always get us all used to his repetitive sound, uninspired orchestration, and robotic compositions. But with this one is like he just wanted to get over it as fast as he could, and didn't created anything new.<br /><br />J N Howard refused to collaborate again in this last score, and the only thing that helped the previous scores to have a certain degree of value went down the toilette.<br /><br />1 - The Storm is Coming : Again, the intro is repeated as it was on the first one, and the only novelty is it has a low note sustain for half of the track.<br /><br />2 - On Thin Ice : Again, nothing surprising. The same chord progression with synth melody on top, which later banishes and continues as the usual over repeated, exhausted Zimmer sound of chained synth harmony. Buuh! The end is spooky, it has, YES, low ascending notes! I never heard that before.<br /><br />3 - Gotham's Reckoning : Again, a boring tune. The ostinatos doesn't have anything particular. I presume Zimmer made a fast \\"copy/paste\\" of the rhythm, and added some low notes of the already known harmony.<br />Then to give some break to our ears, he changes the instrumentation to a minimal one, just percussion, the same boring repeated low notes, and some chants on the background.<br />The track ends with the same rhythmic pattern over and over again till we get sick of it, but this time he adds more instruments to make the sound bigger. Strings just make a chromatic scale, as if somehow this means \\"create tension\\".<br />At the end the \\"choir\\" effect sounds so horrible you can tell it was just a loop made with the computer.<br /><br />4 - Mind if I cut in? : I presume this is the \\"Catwoman\\" scene. Again, this guy has some problem with ostinatos. Seems he can only make a track with ostinatos. If this album wouldn't be called \\"The Dark Knight Rises OST\\", it should be called \\"Ostinatos here, and there\\".<br />I must admit it was the first time you get a variation from allthe monotony of the previous tracks, because now you have a piano playing random notes. But somehow, he cant keep going on with the variations, and has to go back to the boring repetitive sound of his middle synth strings sustaining notes.<br /><br />5 - Underground Army : Yes, the good old ostinato, with a synth bass. The effect of this sound is horrible. It's a new sound which is out of the place. Never you heard this sound in any of the previous albums, and makes your ears notice it immediately.<br />The track ends with a new ostinato, and a really bad sound effect.<br /><br />6 - Born In Darkness : Wow! Something original in all this repetitive boring album...yes! is something totally amazing : a bass glissando! If you take this out, is another boring track, similar to track 2.<br /><br />7 - The Fire Rises : Again, boring ostinatos. Even if it has no rhythmic variation, at least in this one Zimmer decided a monotone, and monodynamic ostinato AGAIN will be too much, so he play a bit with the dynamics.<br />The music suddenly stops, and after a B section of basically nothing, the C section starts to grow, with violin ostinatos, and synth pizz. sounds, while horns and bass make the lower melody. Did I mention he repeated again the same boring \\"choir\\" effect?...ok, yes, he does it again.<br /><br />8 - Nothing Out There : What do you know? Our good old friend Mr. Ostinato. He makes a short intro, to later disappear, and give a bit of time to the piano and the synth strings. No elaborated melody, no interesting counterpoint, piano just play his melody, to create a lot of emotion by using AGAIN the high pitch violins, to end up with the track 2 theme again.<br />When I read the track name, I had a strong impression this is the motto Zimmer used for this album.<br /><br />9 - Despair : This is what I feel when again he repeats the boring ostinato. He this times uses the same rhythmic sound from the intro, with bass and horns playing the two notes theme from the previous albums.<br />The track itself is nothing more than repeat what you heard already in the Batman Begins score.<br /><br />10 - Fear Will Find You : More rhythmic stuff, blablabla, the rhythm comes from the \\"choir\\" sfx, and the Batman two notes them under this. To resume this repetitive boring thing, the strings come to play the same ostinatos we heard over and over again, while the cellos play a new theme, two or three times, just to be forgotten in the again repeated violin ostinato, while the two notes theme repeats AGAIN. No wait, the cellos come back, to re-repeat this never heard melody, but just one time with no variation, probably a \\"copy/paste\\" again.<br /><br />11 - Why Do We Fall? : Again, the same BS repeated from the previous albums, the ostinatos by the percussion, the violins, all crescendo, reptetition, repeat, boring, boring, two notes theme (wow, the cymbals means majestic, somehow, so at the end of the whole mass of repetition, it appears).<br /><br />12 - Death By Exile : Just nothing. Sound effects, boring, nothing. It's just 23 seconds long.<br /><br />13 - Imagine The Fire : If you tell me what does appear first, I give you $1.....An ostinato! YES, here you have. Amazingly, by the end of each 4 beams, Zimmer probably had some free time and added a rhythmic variation on the percussion. It's quite shocking to the ear, from the good old \\"Copy/Paste\\" he got all used from all the previous tracks.<br />Again, this horrible synth electric bass sound appears, taking the whole concept of the music \\"color\\" out of place. With boring strings making more ostinatos.<br />The horns here play a new section, which was meant to create the effect of accumulation of tension, so even if the notes are not repeated too often, for the ear is the same BS than before.<br />The track is 7 minutes long, but I stopped at 3 because my head was exploding. Just moved forward, and can tell you he just repeated the same BS he showed in the previous tracks.<br /><br />14 - Necessary Evil : Yes, evil. What can we do with evil? Lets play low notes! YES! wow! So evil and original.<br />Looks like Zimmer will repeat the whole Batman theme again, but he then stops and continues with boring \\"ethereal\\" sounds, the same we heard at least 5 or 6 times in this album only, and probably 50 times in the whole trilogy.<br /><br />15 - Rise : Yes, bring those ostinatos! No way, lets better give some drama by making a Soprano soloist sing a simple \\"aaaaaaaaah\\". Yes, bravo! This bring tears to my eyes, because I never heard any Morricone soundtrack before, so I have no idea what a Soprano sounds like. Still, lets not make this of \\"creating new sounds\\" a monopoly in the album, lets repeat the same BS we did before.<br />I will not lie you, I also had to move forward this crap of repetitive boring BS, so in the middle you have more \\"ethereal\\" non rhythmic sustained notes, to 3 minutes later have a recapitulation of the Batman Theme. BAM! The music ends, no wait, the Batman two notes theme is played once by this high pitched instrument synth as in the beginning of the album.<br /><br />Voila! There you have! This boring crap could be resumed in one single theme, either rhythmic with boring ostinatos, or \\"ethereal\\" with boring high pitch strings.<br />I could say without mistaking, the estimate of \\"copy/paste\\" Zimmer made in this album could be around the 70%. That's right. You just hear the same crap you heard over and over again 70% of the time.<br />And if we compare it to the rest of the Batman Trilogy, only 5% is new material. One is the \\"choir\\". The other is two or three melodies of 5 to 10 seconds, that you hear probably 30 seconds total on the album.<br /><br />This is a huge disappointment! But hey! It's Zimmer! All his scores are musical disappointments. The guy can create an original sound not even if his life depends on it.<br /><br />P.S. I noticed that less than 1 minute after post this, the review already had a negative vote. Seems some trollfanatic of Zimmer (or Zimmer himself) is around, posting pathetic positive reviews like \\"oh! this soundtrack saved my life\\" \\"oh! I listen it all day long, 100 times per day, and I cry everytime\\"........pathetic.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Its easy at first but it gets harder!! I reccomend it! usually I quit all my puzzle games cause I cant figure 'em out and its frustrating  but this game is easy and hard at the same time! when I cant figure it out  sooner or later I figure it out! :)
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I finally caved and picked up this book the other day, and found myself sneaking in chapters whenever possible.  The book is a fast and engaging read, and I really found myself caring about the characters and their outcomes.  I felt there were some similarities to \\"The Running Man\\" and \\"The Long Walk,\\" both by Stephen King, but the book was still rather unique despite this.  I can see what all of the hype has been about, and have already picked up the second book.  I suspect I'll be done the series by the end of the week!
B00785P2QC|4.0|Its rather fun once you get the hang of it but the goals becoming annoying if you cant do them at that time. So its really not a bad game if you can spend more then 5 min playing
B001VS46DC|5.0|To listen to Diana Krall play and sing with bossa nova inspired arrangements is marvelous.  To note that she has recorded many of the tunes previously and that the arrangements are similar, but the improvisations fresh is to move the performance to 5 stars.  The accompanying orchestra and her rhythm section are sensitive and inspired.  It is a joy to see such good musicians so thoroughly enjoy playing together.  And only in Brazil can you dare to invite the audience to sing, knowing that they will keep time and sing in tune!  Excellent production quality and the bonus track is informative, too.
B007R41E8O|5.0|I loved this game! Is a little difficult if you don't use the hint/help button, but that's what it's there for...I couldn't stop playing this til I got all the way thru it!! I recommend this to anyone who loves mystery/puzzle/hidden objects games!!! Worth the $.99 I paid for it...keep making more games like this, really enjoyed this one (-:
B004ZN9YNC|4.0|The Final Cut is the oft-maligned, \\"Roger Waters in Pink Floyd clothing\\" album that book-ended the Pink Floyd/Waters recording era.  Much is said of the messages, themes, session conflicts, who's on it, who's not on it aspects of this album, but rarely is its place in audio recording history emphasized.  Originally released at a time when the audiophile recordings on vinyl (i.e. analog) era was coming to an end, and the Compact Disc format (i.e. digital) era was emerging, the Final Cut was the first popular music album recording to utilize \\"holophonics\\". See biographical information on Hugo Zuccarelli for more details and information on holophonics.  I happened to be in the retail audio equipment business at the time of its original release, and we used the vinyl Master Recording of this album to dmonstrate to customers the subtle differences amongst various high-end speakers and associated equipment.<br /><br />Ignore the lyrics, themes, band friction, etc.; simply put, this may be one of the very best recordings to demonstrate \\"nuance\\", depth, separation, transparency and dynamic range in the rock audio category to this day.  This album was used to compare the nuances and warmth of vinyl to the new world of first generation digital compact discs.  You could easily tell the differnce between the vinyl pressing of this album and its concurrently released CD version.  Since many Floyders frequently refer to the band's music as \\"headphone sound\\", a Floyd enthusiast could not possibly be disappointed by giving this album the hardcore \\"headphone sound\\" test.  If you do, I suspect you'll find this is the album you should be testing your equipment with.  With the remastering and ever-increasing dynamic range becoming available on digital recordings these days, I suspect that a high quality digital recording will bring much of the ambience and subtleties found in the original vinyl version of the album to your ears.  It is a great source of music for use in speaker and headphone comparisons still today, even in the MP3 format.<br /><br />If YOU can't hear the sound of the billiard balls being struck and landing in the pool table's pockets in the background of \\"Paranoid Eyes\\", then you don't have the right equipment, because it's there-- amongst the many lush aural layers incorporated into this unique, seminal recording.  Yes, Pros and Cons of Hitchhiking also used holophonics, but this was first and PaCoH was not a Pink Floyd album.  Use this album to celebrate the best of binaural 3D sound, remembering that it was released decades before DTS Surround Sound, and you only need 2 speakers.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|This is by far my favorite out of the mystery/puzzle/hidden objects games!! Graphics were beautiful &amp; I would pay for this game over &amp; over again! Hope they come out with a sequel to this one as I'm sure there are alot of people who loved this game as much as I did! Nice to see a mystery/puzzle/hidden objects game that isn't dark or &quot;scary&quot;...breath of fresh air (-:
B004DLPXAO|5.0|This last Up-Date? Great!! The improved dictionary access is wonderful. This completes with my full size kindle &amp; better (pre-Fire Kindle). Plus the other functions, makes this the best e-reader around as far as I'm concern. Highly recommend!!
B004FOA84A|5.0|This game, along with The Lost City, is very addicting...really love these types of games!! Couldn't put my phone down til I got thru to the end! Was a little short but definitely still worth the $.99 I paid for it...keep these awesome games coming! (-:
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this handy holy bible.  The important quotes are highlighted and it is easier to navigate from all the scriptures.  This Holy Bible is an easy read, fun and an easy learning tool.  This Holy Bible is easy to understand and makes studying the scriptures easier and quicker for people that are always on the go or without much time.

B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is a great app because it has tons of games and they are good quality games!! ever since I downloaded it, I'he been hooked!
B006RUJST6|5.0|This was an awesome book that not only could I read and enjoy but my 12 year old daughter could as well! (that doesn't happen often) I don't know if it's true that the author wrote it in a month or not...if so she's got talent.<br />This book made me laugh out loud and cry then laugh again. I couldn't put it down. I love all the characters and think the brothers Kel and Caulder were hilarious and reminded me of most boys that age.<br />I bought the Kindle edition but I am going to have to own the paperback a well!!<br />This is the first time I ever reviewed a book...that's how good it is :)
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The story gets better and more addicting to read in this third book of the trilogy. It made me want more!!
1609613937|5.0|Many already understand that Dr. McDougall has spent his entire career bucking a very well entrenched medical system. I have read other books by Dr. McDougall (one particularly good read is \\"Digestive Tune-up\\") and \\"The Starch Solution\\" does an outstanding job of tying his many teaching-points together in a very readable and understandable book.    Dr. McDougall is an extremely generous teacher--as is evident by visiting his website: [...]. \\"The Starch Solution\\" is packed with a career-full of information with wonderful recipes and personal stories of those he has helped (both directly and indirectly through his writings, videos, and other MDs and nutritionists who have worked with him).    Most diet plans are complicated, involving counting calories, or buying a certain brand of food. But Dr. McDougall, better than just about anyone I have read, shares a very clear message: avoid fats (all plant foods contain all the fat we need with none of the cholesterol found in animal-based foods), eat mostly starches (potatoes, beans, corn, etc.), vegetables and fruits.    There are so many misconceptions about a health promoting diet and most of the confusion originates in the industries providing us with our food supply. The message offered by the media is that the key is moderation and if you are overweight, it is your fault for over indulging. This could not be further from the truth; the food industry and a lack of government oversight is the primary reason many Americans are now fighting a losing battle with both their weight and their health. Dr. McDougall has seen this first hand through patients moving from more healthy populations (Japan for instance) to the U.S. and observing the subsequent generations who replace their traditional plant-based diets with the standard American diet. Obesity and chronic disease become the only \\"reward\\" for adhering to the more opulent American diet.    Dr. McDougall offers a change of habit from a diet rich in animal-based foods, which nearly all of us grew up with, to a diet rich in flavor that provides a wealth of complete nutrition, which is a diet one can grow old with.    \\"The Starch Solution\\" is a wonderful book by one of the most courageous and important doctors now practicing medicine in the U.S.
B0018QQQK8|3.0|The book is rather predictable and Nick Sparks leaves a lot open to the imagination on some things that I feel he should have walked us through more. It was a tad on the boring side but really an easy read!
B0086700CM|5.0|this is a classic game that never gets old. in temple run no two levels are alike therefore its always new. i just hope you enjoy this game as much as i do. happy playing!
B000VMFDW2|5.0|I'm a WWII History buff and have read many documentary type books including \\"Unknown,A story of survival and redemption\\". I found this to be not only exciting and informative, but also sad. It is amazing to me that any of them survived.

0446572993|4.0|America has enemies, some foreign some domestic and Will Robie will see them all dead - except the innocent.<br />Having established himself as the premiere writer of  \\"conspiracy in high places\\" thrillers in 1996 with his first novel, Absolute Power which was made into a hit movie starring Clint Eastwood, Baldacci has now written over twenty novels and remains the master of that subgenre. In The Innocent, Baldacci remains at the top of his game. Baldacci's success lies in an ability to build plots and characters that in lesser hands would seem like the fringe conspiracy theorists best bad dream. But Baldacci makes the story and the characters seem all too plausible and, seemingly, with some kind of prescience, topical and ripped from the headlines.<br /><br />Will Robie is a case in point. He is a veteran assassin for a shady, unnamed U.S. Government agency and he roams the world at his masters bidding eliminating targets as ordered with deadly efficiency. A character and plot that would require the mainstream reader to suspend belief and accept them as entertainment, but with the recent dearth of assassinations of Al-Qaida leaders, Iranian nuclear scientists, etcetera,  they become realistic. Baldacci is a master at this kind of story.<br />from two assignments to eliminate, presumably, just such enemies of America abroad, Will Robie is now on a mission closer to home in and around the nations capital. Armed with a dossier of the intended enemies photo, address, and biography of daily movements and habits he has developed a plan approved by his handler and supported by backup personnel who make sure the needed weapons, information and support services are readily to hand.<br /><br />He doesn't need to know the sins of the person, great or small, he leaves passing judgment to his superiors. He is only the executioner. Cold blooded and unemotional. He has operated this way for over a decade, and though oft times the condemned is an enemy of notorious reputation, just as often they are unknown to the world at large as a threat. Robie just dispatches them as efficiently as a lethal injection and as dethatched and dispassionate as a high-powered bullet fired on a battlefield.<br /><br />Until now. With the voice of his handler guiding his every step and watching, from a distance, his back, he gains entry to the apartment building with the ease of a cat burglar. He makes child's play of the locks to the apartment. He sneaks undetected to the victims bedroom, he IDs the target and then, silenced pistol at hand and aimed, he hesitates. He's not quite sure why he hesitates in the completion of this execution. Is it because the condemned is a woman? But he has had to execute women before. Did he suddenly develop a conscious? But he believes in his mission, however distasteful and non-P.C. it may play out to the media. Is it the unusual anxiety of his handler? But he has been on tense assignments before where his was the only cool hand on site.<br /><br />Perhaps it is the unlikely location of the enemy in a quiet Washington D.C. suburb that wouldn't seem the hideout of a public enemy. Perhaps it is the child, obviously the woman's son, in bed with the target. But he still could have soundlessly dispatched her to oblivion and the child is young enough to where he would soon forget and heal from the trauma. But, nonetheless, for the first time ever, he hesitates. His handler frantically calling for him to complete the assignment, urging him on in a near-panicked voice but still Robie hesitates and then the child awakens and the intended victim stirs. Robie does the unthinkable, if hesitating is unthinkable, then this action is doubly so. He attempts to save the condemned, but her reprieve is short lived as a sniper's bullet pierces the window killing her and the child with one high velocity round.<br /><br />Robie knows that the killing is not finished in this room on this night. Having hesitated, having failed in the mission, his valueto his handler and his employer is as worthless as his actions a few minutes earlier. But, Robie has the advantage of knowing what comes next. He knows where his handler and the support team will set up in order to eliminate the liability he has become to them. So, he out guesses them, being far superior to them in tactics of escaping the scene of an assassination. Then he once again does the unthinkable. He rescues the victim's other child, a baby still in diapers, from  the apartment and leaves the child in a carrier at the door of another resident. Then, he evades his now would be killers and executes his escape plan, which is not even known to his handlers.<br /><br />As he makes his way to a second rate bus station to flea the city for New York, and then out of the country, he watches everything and everyone since he knows his hunters are deadly and efficient. As he boards a midnight bus with tickets bought anonymously as an exodus and a hedge against just such a failure of plans, he is vigilant as he must be to survive. As a man enters the bus just as it pulls out of the station, Robie identifies him as a man just like himself; a stone killer, a professional executioner. But amazingly, the killer doesn't come for him. The killer starts to act against a young teenage girl a few rows in front of Robie and for the third time this evening, inside this hour, Robie once again displays, incongruously, his humanity. He saves the girl by killing the killer and then escapes the bus. But as the unlikely pair make their escape, the bus explodes.<br /><br />Robie is convinced that his employer and handler could not have known his escape plan or anticipated his route, therefore the girl, Julie, must be the target. Now, tasked with running for his life, and with Julie as a hindrance to that task he finds himself in the unfamiliar spot of being a protector. He is doubly tasked with saving his life and Julie's as he sets out to investigate why his intended victim was marked for assassination and why Julie is on the run from a hit squad that seems just as determined as his former employers. As the bodies stack up, both from Julie's pursuers and his own and as he quickly learns that he can't trust anyone, either from his government or the criminal world where Julie's parents lived, he slowly uncovers sins and subterfuge at every turn and rising to the top of the government.<br /><br />Baldacci has crafted a clever plot that takes the usual twists and turns with expected red herrings and dead ends but in his hands aren't simply plot devices but the tools for exposing the dangers confronting 21st century warriors of terrorism and law enforcement agencies in a world where the criminals can afford to not just \\"buy a cop\\" but buy an agency. Baldacci makes both the good guys and the bad guys living breathing people and the hurdles they all strive to overcome as up to date as tomorrows headlines. His dialog is succinct, direct, and hard edged. His sense of place as complete as a tour guides, the tension is a taut and beautifully maintained as a tightrope walkers and the narration is top drawer.

B003O86FMW|4.0|After the first book you wonder what the author was going to do to make the second book good. She did a good job, but it ends with a bit of a cliff hanger so make sure you have the third book close at hand when you're done!
B000002VRZ|5.0|One of the most under estimated bands from the south were The Outlaws. They always put on a good live show, and they had some of the best long-play guitar pickin' songs in their time. This collection is a good buy, as it has most of the hits from The Outlaws. Make sure you get this, it will impress you.

B0012GMYUU|5.0|I have always liked Jeff Beck, from his early days with The Yardbirds, to his days with Rod Stewart and Ron Wood, to his Jazz-Fusion days (which I still think is his best stuff), to his days of playing Guitar and just having fun, like on this item. He still can belt out the good licks and sounds, and he does get a little heavy on this one. Buy it if you love Jeff Beck, but at your own risk.
B0058ZPNOK|5.0|Dudes, this movie is a masterpiece. It's funny and entertaining, but also enthralling and inspiring. There's a deep message in this movie about moving on from tragedy and discovering or re-discovering the fighter in you.... about re-learning how to kick ass in life. The acting, the script... everything was superb. Hell, I just saw this movie with my 11 year old son, right after watching X-Men:First Class (another great movie) and my son preferred \\"Hesher\\". He totally dug the movie. The Metallica soundtrack only makes it even more kick ass!!!
B007M45PMU|5.0|Trying to compare with a contemporary is difficult. Maybe Head and the Heart is a close comparison but with the lyrics of Mumford & Son/A Fine Frenzy. They have a definite folk/bluegrass sound without being overly twangy. I really like \\"Submarines\\", \\"Stubborn Love\\", \\"Ho Hey\\", and \\"Morning Song\\". They sound genuine...their sound seems like it wasn't overly tampered with in-studio. Overall, a great summer album.
0307949508|5.0|I purchased this book and was thrilled with it. I believe it is actually better than the first book in the trilogy, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. I literally devoured the book and was about 90%  through it when, as I moved on to another page the next page didn't make sense. I stopped short. Checked the page numbers and was shocked to find that 49 pages were missing. The last page I read was page 596. It then jumped to page 645. Talk about freaked out! This book really is a page turner and I was so into it that I immediately ran out of the house and down to my neighborhood bookstore. Thankfully, they had the book in stock. I think I would have driven an hour to find another copy. When I told the clerk my story she said that this sort of thing had happened to them too. It's a simple printing error. I never bothered trying to return the book. I'm sure I could get my money back but I'm not going to bother. However, if you purchase this book from this particular seller you might want to check to make sure those pages are there. The clerk said they sometime come in batches. Now as far as the actual story...if you liked The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo you are really going to love The Girl Who Played with Fire. I couldn't put it down. Oh, and make sure you have the third book at your side because I can promise you, you are going to want to just pick that one up and keep reading. It picks up immediately where this book ends. It is such a shame that Stieg Larsson is no longer with us. He has created one of the most unusual heroines I have ever met. The writing itself is exceptional. The plot line is complex enough to keep you intrigued. But the best part is his character development. I love the characters. Blomkvist, Berger, and all the others are very real; very believable. The bad guys are really nasty; you will love to hate them. But the shining star of the story is Lisbeth. There will never be another heroine like Lisbeth Salander. He broke the mold with this one. Grab this book and you won't put it down. It will keep you on the edge of your seat. And remember to have The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest ready and waiting!this book and you won't put it down. It will keep you on the edge of your seat. And remember to have The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest ready and waiting!

Absolutely, I have no regrets and really like this music. I Wanna Rock, Rock, Rock, Rock!! Yes, the music is that motivating.

0345803485|3.0|The book was in perfect condition. It was exactly as I expected. It arrived in a timely manner.<br />The book is a fast read. I enjoyed it enough to order the second two - altho some of it felt repetitive. It's an inside look at what goes on in an obssessive relationship. Is she really into this S&D? Or is she just young and dazzled by his beauty and his money?<br /><br />Yes, its a bit \\"high-schoolish\\" and it would have been more interesting if the writer had introduced a few more characters and also more creative sex play. For example \\"9-1/2 Weeks\\".<br /><br />These books were very popular in the 70 and 80's because of the sexual revolution. After Herpes and AIDs, movies & books cleaned up their acts. I guess the public was ready for new porn? Will the movie get a XXX-Rating? Without it, I cant see how they can film the book. I'd love to see Lucy Hale in the movie, but who will play Grey?? He has to be young, tall and very handsome. Any ideas?

0345803485|1.0|I wasn't going to bother to write a review of this most terrible book, but then someone made a great comment that inspired me to write my first review ever.  I feel I have a responsibility to add to all the one-star reviews to knock this book's overall rating down where it belongs and get it off the best-seller list.  I, too, feel duped by all the hype about this piece of garbage.  Boring, stupid, insulting, poorly written...I don't know how to emphasize how bad this book really is.  I can't believe so many women love it.  Why???  I was watching \\"Jimmy Kimmel\\" last night and he mentioned \\"Fifty Shades\\" in his monologue.  The women in the audience went wild and my heart sank.  They cannot be screaming for the same book that made me so sick and bored at the same time.  They just can't!!!<br /><br />My friend highly recommended \\"Fifty Shades\\" to me.  I'm a little irritated with her for encouraging me to waste my $10 and now know to NEVER read a book she likes again!  Do not make the same mistake I did and do not buy this drivel.  I am mad at my friend, but outraged by this E L James!  Shame on her for writing this juvenile piece of trash.<br /><br />Although I have suffered through reading \\"Fifty Shades\\", I will admit that there is one bit of silver lining.  I have thoroughly enjoyed the one-star reviews and have actually laughed out loud reading them.  They are much more entertaining and have reassured me that I'm not alone being appalled by this book.  So happy to read that so many others were driven mad by all the inane phrases and images repeated at a nauseating rate (please don't bite your lip again!!!) and the ridiculous Britishisms in a book supposedly about Americans in the Pacific Northwest (her step-dad makes a great cup of tea AND loves European soccer?  Really??)  I could go on and on why I hate this book, but others have said it much better than I can.  Simply put...don't read this piece of Holy Crap!!!!

0857688219|5.0|This is a mystery, there are no two ways about it.  The long halloween follows the story a holiday themed killer who systematically kills members of both mob families, however the true story is the creation of two face.  Jeph loeb(batman hush) spins Gordon, Batman and Harvey Dent together in trilogy, demonstrating their symbiotic relationships and eventual friendships.  Told beautifully with tim sales terrificly drawn ugly mobsters in pinstripe suits and sprawling slums, a mystery that actually<br />keeps you guessing and adds new life to the dried up genre of mystery and is more than deserving of your 20 bucks
B00003CXA2|5.0|In a world where so many movies are cookie-cutter, Forrest Gump stands out about having a very distinct storyline that is rarely found elsewhere. Most movies are about the bravest, the strongest, and the most beautiful / handsome as they plow through their lives. In Forrest Gump, Tom Hanks is instead a man who has many challenges in life. His legs won't work properly. He is not smart enough to be allowed in a traditional school. But through the perseverence of his loving, single mother, he gets the foundation in life, the moral strength, and the perseverence to thrive.<br /><br />Forrest absolutely does not have an \\"easy life\\". His mother was abandoned by her husband and runs a boarding house. She pours all her love and dedication into raising her son to be able to take care of himself and to be content. She sleeps with the school's principle when he tells her that Forrest can't go to school. She tells Forrest repeatedly that he is just as good as anyone else, and that life is unpredictable and that that is normal. The line in the movie is: \\"Mama always said life was like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're gonna get.\\" It's become so popular that it is now almost cliche. It's important to remember that it GOT popular because so many people relate to its meaning. You might like the flavor of a chocolate, or dislike it, but it's all part of life, and you go on and have another one.<br /><br />Hanks shines in this, as does Sinise, and both are well deserving of the many awards they won. Forrest is not one dimensional. Yes, he is not a genius. But he is still a complex character. When Jenny turns down his marriage proposal, he stares at her for a moment, then tells her, \\"I may not be a smart man, but I know what love is.\\" With the conviction in his voice, and the emotion in his face, you know absolutely that he does.<br /><br />Some of the movie is a bit heavy-handed. The repeated insertions of Gump into seemingly every single important moment in American history - including teaching Elvis how to dance, meeting with multiple presidents, and so on, can seem a bit much. He invented the smiley face. He happened to invest in Apple. The music soundtrack suffers from this \\"club on the head\\" issue. When Jenny leaves an abusive boyfriend, the sountrack sings \\"don't you love her madly as she's walking out the door\\" just as she does.<br /><br />But then there are moments when I am powerfully affected, every time I see this movie. When Jenny was little, her father abused her. Forrest doesn't quite understand this, but later in life when they're both adults they return to her childhood home. Jenny starts throwing rocks at the house, furious at what her father had done, and then collapses. Forrest feels her pain, and says, \\"Sometimes, I guess there just aren't enough rocks\\". He knows exactly what she's going through, inside, and gets to the core of the emotion.<br /><br />It is a bit sad that, even though the two most important people in his life are his mother and Jenny, the two never interact at all. And those two women never seem to interact with any other women. So this movie is all about Forrest, all his male friends, and then the men around his mother and Jenny. So we have an entire movie full of men and then \\"the mom\\" and \\"the love\\". I would have appreciated greatly a more rich world.<br /><br />But, still, this is a problem with just about every movie, so it's hard to fault Forrest Gump too much for this flaw. And the movie does embrace a wealth of issues. Dan deals with life with no lower legs. Forrest deals with his mental challenges. Jenny is a survivor of child abuse. Forrest's mom struggles as a poor single mom. Together they all make it through their challenges.<br /><br />Well recommended.story - including teaching Elvis how to dance, meeting with multiple presidents, and so on, can seem a bit much.

I was delighted to find that this novel targeted for a young adult audience had so much to offer in thought provoking content.  This book engages the reader in a mature conversation about important topics.  Once I started, I found myself melting through pages as I voraciously devoured the deliciously stimulating plot.  This book is a shining example of a genuine hand crafted novel piquing your interest at every turn.  Enrapturing to the very end, this book is well worth the read.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I purchased this book based on the overwhelming number of great reviews.  The author is a skilled writer and the plot methodology was well done.  For some reason I was never emotionally drawn in by the characters.  They seemed flat.  The ending was disappointing.  More importantly, what happened to Amy that caused this whole scenario?  There was no discernable catalyst or pattern to cause the level seen here.  I was hungry for a page turner.  This was not the one for me.  I would consider future books by this author because this story did not do justice to the talent obviously there.

B000H4QD1O|5.0|When a friend told me to watch Firefly, a Space-Western, I was put off. That was a terrible mistake. I didn't watch the show till a few years later. I have seen the show six or seven times through since then. The quality of writing is unparalleled. The characters and the conversation feel Real. While Nathan Fillion makes this show great, he is supported by a fantastic cast including Alan Tudyk, Adam Baldwin and Jewel Staite all giving stellar performances. You will notice not just the quality of dialog and acting, but also the set design and musical score. Joss Whedon has created a beautiful believable world, with good and bad. This isn't a dsytopian or utopian future, but rather a future that feels natural. The Alliance, while portrayed as essentially as 'the enemy' isn't all bad: it's a group of people who genuinely believe in what they're fighting for, and try to do the right thing (see first episode and the third episode. This just adds to the believability of the world Firefly is set in. Lastly, the attention to detail is fantastic. For example, notice how Mal (Fillion) loses the crucifix pendant after saying that God won't let them die because they're too pretty. Watch this show.

0553386794|5.0|There are a lot of reviews on Amazon about this book so I'll make this short, sweet and to the point:<br /><br />A Game of Thrones by George R.R. Martin is an outstanding first book to the epic series A Song of Ice and Fire. It is one of those books that you will fight to put down.<br /><br />Martin's writing is incredible, he lures the reader in with sensory descriptions then keeps the readers interested with surprising plot twists. Towards the end of A Game of Thrones I began to wonder about the characters and their outcomes immensely (it was all I could think about.) If the words of a writer have the ability to inflict such vast emotions into they're readers then they are truly a top notch writer, in my opinion. Also, I do enjoy books written in different characters point of view; I feel as though they give more to the overall plot than one characters POV or a narrator, for example.<br /><br />Aside from the actual writing, the story is unbelievable and addicting. Martin describes the seven kingdoms with such detail that just for a moment you may second guess your high school history classes.<br /><br />To sum up my review: the story is amazing, the writing is incredible and the series is addicting. You will not regret reading A Song of Ice and Fire series!
B00846TTDG|5.0|This movie was recommended to me by my son who is action hero movie buff.Critics say the acting is poor,but I thought it was good.Its a modern could happen action movie,we live in a dangerous world and some unsung heroes lay it all on the line behind the public view everyday.
B0063IH60K|4.0|It's good and fun, just a little laggy at sometimes... If the lags were fixed, then it would get five stars from me. I have this game on my phone and it lags also, so maybe it's not just my Kindle.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I have had none of the problems mentioned in other reviews so maybe the kendle fire have been addressed. Easy to learn but still challenging enough.
B0047Y0FGY|3.0|Tina Fey is one funny lady! I love her comical and sarcastic take on her life growing up and leading others.
B004APVI1G|5.0|My TV is a 64\\" 550 series Samsung 3D .  I am using a Panasonic  3D Blueray DVD player.  I have over the last year sampled a extensive selection highly regarded 3D movies.  This movie I found to use the 3D effect in the most effective method to date.  If you rate your 3D movies by how close objects get to your face this movie probably will disappoint but if you value being visually pulled into a movie then this is your kind of movie.  Naturally you must  like the story line as many before me have so abley reviewed.  With that one qualifier I suggest your 3D movie collection will not be complete without this master piece. It is truly a visual experience.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I really enjoyed getting into the characters in this book. Between the storyline and all the juicy bits, I couldn't put it down!
B008MEM24S|5.0|No idea what the last reviewer is talking about. I'm posting from my kindle fire and the game works. Perfect! Really fun game. If you like Where's my water? You will love this game. The \\"Perry\\" twist just makes it so much more fun! Well worth the money!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|By the time I got to book 3 in this trilogy I was completely drawn into the storyline. I worried at the beginning that there wasn't much else to tell of the story, but it brought everything together nicely and had the ending I hoped for!
B0088RQ4TI|1.0|Ok.. I am a minority here. But I can't figure out the taste of those people giving 5stars to this movie.. I think it is something like Democrat vs Republic stuff.. I remember many people had given 1star to \\"No Country for Old Men\\" which is worth all 5stars... So anyways, I rented this movie from Amazon VOD based upon higher user ratings.. and Now I agree with the critics.. The plot sucks.. the lead actress totally puts dumb face many times..And there are is nothing original or interesting in this movie to watch.. I just wasted my time and money..And this can no way be compared to Star Wars or Avatar.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This was definitely my favorite out of all three \\"Fifty Shades\\" books. It really got into the characters and why they are the way they are. Couldn't put it down!
0440246016|2.0|I have read the killing floor and Worth dying for and one thing those had in common is that you read the first page or two and you simply cannot stop reading, its almost painful to put the book down when you are about to fall asleep. In fact with the killing floor it took only half a page to be hooked up.<br /><br />However this novel has a different structure and I didn't find it so captivating, I was able to put it down for days a number of times, in fact I read the first chapter of the book and didn't come back to it until 2 weeks later.<br /><br />It almost looks to me as if Lee Child had used a ghost writer because the way the story is structured, the way Reacher is presented in the first part of the book and throughout the chapters is almost as if someone had studied the character (not the creator) and had tried to write a book about him, but in a different way that the other novels were written.<br /><br />After the first half the book starts getting more interesting and overall its OK, but not nearly as good as the other two, which I find dissapointing. Maybe Lee Child was busy with the Tom Cruise movie or doing something else, I hope future novels become as good as the prior ones.
B008645YEE|3.0|I had heard through other reviews, that James Newton Howard did NOT return for this score--one of the FEW albums I've been greatly anticipating this year--and after listening to the whole thing, I can't help but wonder. Why would he bail before the final act?  How much better could this album be if he had contributed? Furthermore, how much of his influence went into making \\"The Dark Knight\\" score so awesome?<br /><br />  I used to give Hans Zimmer so much credit for \\"The Dark Knight\\" album, simply because his name came first in the credits. But after listening to the follow-up, I'm starting to think I gave the credit to the wrong man.<br /><br />  To make a long story short, this album reuses so much of the \\"Dark Knight\\" soundtrack throughout (mostly in the second half), that it feels like I paid more money for the same content; just blended in with some weaker, new material. This certainly doesn't feel like a successor to it's predecessor... yet.  In fact, it REUSES so much from it's predecessor, that I start to become annoyed by all the repetition of material I've already heard.  I didn't buy this album to hear \\"The Dark Knight\\" score all over again.  I already own that CD after all, and played it to death.<br /><br />  What isn't rehashed from the last album isn't very memorable... yet.  Maybe I'll feel differently after I see the film with the music attached. Until then, I'm going to keep listening and hoping it grows on me.  Oh, wait... half of it already did!  Four years ago!<br /><br />  Kidding aside, I wish James had returned for this follow-up.  I hate wondering what could have been in any case, but this is \\"The Dark Knight\\" finale.  Or, at least, it was SUPPOSED to be.  But how can you have a complete finale when one half of the team drops out before it's complete?  I give Hans Zimmer credit for trying, especially considering the fact that I've never scored a damn thing in my life.  I'm just not feeling this effort.  Not yet.
B00701L5XS|5.0|Perfect for me and my boys who are in scouts.  better then learning from the boy scout books.  Free makes it that much better.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|I like the large key size,  it helps to eliminate errors.  Simple to use with just enough functions to be practical. recommended.
B00785P2QC|5.0|This game is very fun for me and great when waiting. Just cant seem to put it up once I start!! G5 games are great!!
B007K3JFUQ|2.0|Positives:<br />Good sets and scenes (even if mostly green screen); good period costuming. A gallant try by Downey but ...<br /><br />Negatives:<br />Basil is turning over in his grave. What happened to the mystery; the natural believability of real sleuthing.<br />It seemed as if the plot, script and role were written with Depp in mind. And, maybe he might have pulled it off but I doubt it. Watching Downey I couldn't get Depp out of my mind.<br />The fight scenes and bullets with the high speed filming reduced to slo-mo was not only been-done-for-decades old, but actually took away from the natural mystery of the story. It and other events seemed overly staged like you could see all the crew along side the sets.<br />The tone of the movie was too narcissistic and self-indulgent not only in the acting, directing but especially in the script. Let's see how clever we can be just stood out. The twists, problem solving, sleuthing and displays of observational skills besides being not believable were excessive. Like the tricky filming it soon became a distraction.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I bought the book because the author is a local massachusetts man.  the book is outstanding I intend to purchase more of his books
B005USZYDU|5.0|Enjoyed the book.  The book is more for a younger set but I still enjoyed the book.  It is a John Grisham book.  Need I say more.
0091933684|5.0|I got this book as a gift from cousins in the UK, who raved about it. They warned some recipes take time and some ingredients might be obscure. But I was won over by the lush photography and unusual combinations of ingredients--and the unusual ingredients, period. I wanted to know what pomegranate molasses and dried Iranian limes were about. So far, I've made three recipes and they have looked lovely and tasted even better. I heartily recommend this book to those who want to try new flavors and who want to renew their love of vegetables.
030758836X|4.0|When I started this book, I wasn't sure I would be able to get into it.  I decided to keep trekking along and finally got hooked.  I was extremely disappointed by the ending.  The ending totally ruins the entire book.  I cannot believe any editor read this and felt it shouldn't be changed.  Too bad because otherwise it was a great read.
B006OAB2XO|5.0|This is such a great album and Grimes is such a great artist, if you're considering buying this album, you definitely should.

B007IXWKUK|5.0|I absolutely loved this Book! I could not put it down. I love that you get to see how the characters change with each other.
B005HV6Y84|3.0|This is not the best of the twilight soundtracks. The songs are mediocre at best.  I really hated the songs \\"It Will Rain\\" and \\" Neighbors\\" I thought they were totally out of place on the soundtrack!
B008MEM24S|5.0|&quot;This my new favorite game. I loved 'Where's My Water' but this is so much better. I am addicted to it.&quot;<br /><br />M.S.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|the best game ever made in ever in the Usa also the movie I<br />s the bomb and it cool
1439156816|5.0|Umm... why have I not read this book in its entirety before? I feel like I wasn't truly a writer until I read this one front to back. I've had several fiction/creative writing classes that used part of On Writing as a \\"tool\\" (pun intended) to help students with the writing process. Honestly, I have no clue why I didn't read the entire thing until now. Maybe, I felt I had better things to read, or write or do. Now I know that was a huge mistake. By far, the best \\"writing\\" manual I've read.<br /><br />The Good: Well the first thing I loved about this book and almost all of Stephen King's fiction is his ability to put it all out there. He even admits that what he's writing... it could be complete crap or it could actually be useful morsels of information...he is Stephen King and all. I love his humor, crass and even the times when I didn't necessarily agree with what he was saying, he said it in a way that was so...straight forward that you couldn't help but appreciate what he said anyways. He doesn't sugarcoat anything, but he's also one of those writers that knows sometimes people make things way harder than they need to be. I love that he's honest about where he started, how he got his start and his own writing process. So many authors these days seem like a mystery. They either have this magical beginning that seemed to bloom for them, or they are a Cinderella story (Amanda Hocking anyone?). I also really enjoyed getting to know Stephen King a little better. I was reading his books before I could even really understand what some of them were about. I think above everything though, this novel is just a down to earth guide for writers. I really gleaned a lot from this Mr. King's memoir/writing guide, and I truly do think every *serious* writer should have to read it. I'd like to share a few of my favorite words of wisdom from the master of horror.<br /><br />**This one reminds me of my fiance<br />\\"Writing is a lonely job. Having someone who believes in you makes a lot of difference. They don't have to make speeches. Just believing is usually enough\\" -pg. 74<br /><br />\\"Stopping a piece of work just because it's hard , either emotionally or imaginatively , is a bad idea. Sometimes you have to go on when you don't feel like it, and sometimes you're doing good work when it feels like all you're managing is to shovel shit from a sitting position.\\" -pg. 77-78<br /><br />\\"You must not come lightly to the blank page.\\" -pg. 106<br /><br />\\"The best from of dialogue attribution is said.\\" -pg. 127<br /><br />\\"Good writing is often about letting go of fear and affection.\\" -pg. 128<br /><br />\\"If you don't want to work your ass off, you have no business trying to write well\\"- pg. 144<br /><br />\\"If you want to be a writer, you do two things above all others: read a lot and write a lot.\\" -pg. 145<br /><br />\\"Quite often the bad books teach you more than the good ones.\\"-pg 145<br /><br />\\"The Grapes of Wrath may fill a new writer with feelings of despair and good old-fashioned jealously-- \\"I'll never be able to write anything that good, not if I live to be a a thousand--\\" but such feelings can also serve as a spur, goading the writer to work harder and aim higher.\\"- pg.146<br /><br />\\"You cannot hope to sweep someone else away by the force of your writing until it has been done to you.\\"- pg. 146<br /><br />\\"When you find something at which you are talented, you do it (whatever it is) until your fingers bleed or your eyes are ready to fall out of your head.\\"- pg 150<br /><br />The Bad: Really there isn't anything \\"bad\\" about this book. Mainly, I would have liked a little more guidance or direction in terms of writing. I mean, he does touch on things like character, plot, dialogue but I would have liked to have some more words of wisdom from someone who has written over 50 novels and obviously loves the craft.<br /><br />Overall, this was an absolutely brilliant read. I highly recommend it for readers and writers alike. Even if you aren't interested in writing or the process, getting a little bit personal with Stephen King is worth this read
B008K9UZY4|5.0|It is the best sonic game I have ever played.For me this is the best sonic game in America !!!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|love that this game is great for both Kidd and adults. one downside is the amount of ads during gameplay. other than that I recommend this game ti anyone looking to waste a few hours
B001VPJYZK|5.0|I'm continuing with the series that I absolutely love!  It is awesome to sit down on a day with nothing to do & watch these episodes non-stop without commercials :-)
B0070NSPCU|5.0|First of all, a huge Thank You!! To earlier reviewers - you didn't lead me astray. For those of you like me who read the reviews, but scratch their head when all they see are positive ones...well in this case it is true! Excellent book! It is truly a first-rate story. Plenty of action, well thought-out world, and character development without losing pace. At 2.99, this is one of the better books I've purchased in a long-time. Very much looking forward to his next work.
B007IXWL2C|2.0|Can't believe I spent money on this series. The main character is a needy girl with no real substance. The writing is repetitive. The BDSM scenes are contrite. I highly recommend the Guys Guide to Fifty Shades.

0307712508|5.0|Rebecca Skioot did a fabulous job of mixing just the right about of family stories with this historical event.  It was a Book Club Read but I am thrilled to have read it and the information provided  was priceless.  I feel for the Lacks family but hope they are equally as proud of all the good Henrietta's cells have done for mankind.
B0058VW36U|5.0|I absolutely love this game but I am still yet to find to find a free version of the game for kindle fire. I would really love and enjoy it. ((:
B0070NSPCU|4.0|This is an excellent book.  It captures and keeps your attention within a couple of pages.  The plot is well laid out and there are relatively few typographical errors.  On a few occasions it is difficult to tell which character is \\"speaking\\", but this doesn't detract much from what is a really good read.  I'll be buying the sequel.
B008JGSM6G|2.0|clean design but the kids would love it w/some cute animals. after twice solving ten puzzles in one minute my enthiusism went south. check out 'cross me knot' for the flip side of this coin: generic graphics but much better puzzle
B004JZBGWI|4.0|Very satisfied with this app. It is handy when on the go with my Kindle Fire. As a preacher, it helps me record and organize the many thoughts and questions that pass through my mind during the course of a day. Also serves as a great to-do reminder list.<br /><br />Thank you Amazon for providing great apps.

B000002J0P|5.0|My youth revisited!  This CD takes me right back to high school.  Wonderfully engineered and reproduced on CD, the musical genius of the artists flows beautifully.  Some songs still give me the goose bumps, and make me cry-- the harmony is so beautiful.<br />Makes long business trips in the car a breeze as I'm singing  and rocking out to CSN!!  Love it!
B005EGXNLS|4.0|Great bloody battles. Utrid's method of solving problems is to kill all his king's enemies; and he does. This one has even less character development and scene setting than the previous books in the Utrid series. But nobody writes battle scenes and fights better than Bernard Cornwell.<br />[[ASIN:B007TAF1JY MONSTERS OF THE MIDWAY: 1969 - Sex, Drugs, Rock 'n Roll, and Football]]

B007SGM084|2.0|I love to read and I have read many romance writers with better products.  If you want the \\"shock\\" effect or learning more about dominants/submissives then read this book.  Book is lacking on context & tension between main characters.  Many people I talked to were also disappointed....although my sister still wants to read because she's heard so much about it even after my review.

B007SYWFRM|5.0|its like. no app ive ever had u can play mini games. buy various types of animals and. structures. I love it and I spend a lot of time on this game if I could marry apps this one would be my soul mate
B007UQ5Z1G|5.0|About the product. No damages or scratches. Got it within one week after the releas date. Oh and the album is perfect in case someone wonders if its worth the money :)<br />About the album.They put all of their love and hard work in every album but that one is the most special and strong. In my opinion Living Things's lyrics and music contain all four previous albums. Linkin Park is my number one band and they never fail my expectations!
B000VHXBIU|5.0|So often when I go back and watch again a movie that I enjoyed long ago I find that it doesn't seem so good anymore.  But this movie is still hysterical!  Kevin Kline, in particular, is an absolute riot, but John Cleese and Jamie Lee Curtis are both great, too.<br /><br />If you are in the mood for some wild, silly humor, you could hardly do better than this.

B000AJIF4E|5.0|I've been using these every day for 7 years. My first pair finally gave out because my cat chewed the cable. $100 for 7 years of high quality audio = $14.29 per year. I've just bought my second pair.
B0077SGMXM|4.0|I've played the game off and on since downloading as the free app of the day. In all, it's a good time killer and is great for sitting down and playing for 10-15 minutes at a time. That said, not sure if I would ever pay 2.99 for it, but that is purely based on my personal preference. For someone who really gets into the game, it could be well worth the investment due to the vast array of levels and content.
B0086700CM|5.0|I waited for this game to come to Kindle fire and when it did I bought it and I love it! it is a great game! I have yet to find anything wrong with this game. only that without WIFI it lags a little.
B005VPRET4|4.0|Legos are always fun for the youngsters; however, we were a little disappointed in this one.  Our great-grandson loves the CITY legos and I thought this was a part of that series.  This was unrelated and it is more for a girl than a young boy.
B005LAII0I|5.0|My family and I were intrigued by this while scrolling through our Video On Demand one evening, and decided to give it a try. It was truly a dazzling movie, and even Mrs. Roberts did a fairly decent job as the wicked step-mother/witch/queen regent...Some marvelous characters, amazing Cinematography, and spectacular costuming. Great fun overall!
B008MEM24S|5.0|i love this app and it very fun and addictive. one problem about it is that its kind of similar to where's my water
B006H8BIIM|5.0|My God!  Everyone is slamming this game claiming that you have to spend $$ to win it.  Not true, I finished it in about 2 weeks, casual playing every couple of nights.  Its a fun game!  Good balance for mining and defense.  i liked it a lot, and yes you can spend $1, yes a louse buck to get all the upgrades for your ship, but only if you want to. Its very clear if you want to buy it, the game doesn't trick you into buying it or anything.  Please buy it, support these excellent high quality android games and review the games, dont flip out over the OPTION to purchase upgrades.
0671449028|1.0|[[ASIN:0671449028 The Going-To-Bed Book]]<br /><br />I am sorry I wasted my money on this book.  I was looking for a simple 'bedtime' story book and I don't care for it at all.  Remember, the title is \\"The Going To Bed Book\\".  So why are they on a boat?  ... and \\"they\\" are several animals, some of which I can't even tell what they are supposed to be.<br /><br />They all go below (remember it's a boat) to take a bath ... all together in one big tub.<br />Then they brush their teeth .... all together again (some on top of each other).<br />Then they all go upstair. The pictures shows them all RUNNING UP THE STAIRS! Really?  Why do they need to run up the stairs?<br />And why do they race up the stairs?  \\"to excercise!\\"<br /><br />Just not the *ideas* I wish to put in my child's head.  No, we don't all bathe together and no, we certainly don't run up the stairs and we certainly do NOT need to be excercising just before we turn off the lights and go to sleep.<br /><br />I don't mind silliness, but this book was just awful in my opinion.  There are better children's books out there.
B00701L5XS|5.0|17AUG2012<br /><br />UPDATE: The developer commented (see comments link on this post) with news that the privacy issues have been removed.  In fact, there are no special permissions needed at all.  Therefore, I have increased the star rating to its well-deserved 5-stars!<br /><br />This is an awesome, and potentially life or property-saving app, perfect for the scout or anyone needing a good knot from time to time, and especially useful for folks such as Boatswain's Mates!<br /><br />I'm impressed with this developer, who actually understood the concerns from the beginning and worked diligently to address them and to remove them.  I hope that other devs learn from his example, and equally hope that fellow reviewers revisit their reviews; after all, the software has undergone a significant change - a change prompted directly by those reviews.<br /><br />Robert~<br /><br />=========================<br />ORIGINAL REVIEW:<br /><br />I went ahead and gave this app four stars because of its unique and helpful nature.  As a cub scout leader, this app certainly belongs on my phone.  However, it would have received five stars if it weren't for the privacy issues as others have discussed.<br /><br />Because of the privacy issues, I normally would _not_ give an app with this many problems a higher score than three stars, and typically less.  However, the reasons I made an exception for this app are:<br /><br />* The developer has tried to clearly explain the issue and has promised to be more transparent.  I'm hoping that he is looking into a different SDK that doesn't use its customers (app developers, in this case) to bundle was is essentially adware and spyware within each app created by the SDK.  There are better alternatives than Corona.<br /><br />* The practicality and usefulness of this app are genuinely helpful, and potentially life-saving.<br /><br />* There is no IAP in this app.  Always good for something above a 1-star these days.<br /><br />* The problems with the privacy can be stopped with a firewall (device might have to be rooted) or a custom ROM (operating system).  Fortunately, I have both, so I don't worry about the privacy problems with this app.<br /><br />When the problems are resolved, I intend on changing my score to five full stars.  I hope others follow suit, as well.privacy can be stopped with a firewall (device might have to be rooted) or a custom ROM (operating system).

B000002KIK|5.0|First of all, if you are expecting a band to play the same exact same sounding album and then realease it 7 times in a row then you don't understand the evolution that takes place in the mind of a true musician.<br /><br />This album DID have a \\"Black Sabbath Standard\\" for all of the long time fans which was, of course, the Title track itself \\"Never Say Die\\". However, they had as individuals, experienced so much turmoil in their private lives that they couldn't help but express it in the bitter-sweet sorrow of the Jazz-Rooted endeavors like \\"Airdance\\", Junior's Eyes\\" and \\"Breakout\\", not to mention the painstakingloy sung \\"Swinging The Chain\\".<br />You will see what I mean when you experience this album for the first time with a clear perspective.<br />In knowing all of Black Sabbath's history from it's inception, to it's abortion, to it's rebirth, I see this album as a must-have for ANY Balck Sabbath fan.<br />This album stands apart from the first 7 releases insofar as it reflects the throws of agony of a band facing it's final release and knowing it, yet still refusing to quit...Hence the name of the album.<br />I for one find solace in knowing that even to this day, Black Sabbath will NEVER...SAY...DIE !!<br /><br />XXX ROCK ON XXX<br />Mr.W
8866131369|5.0|I'm just a few weeks into my first Moleskine 18-month planner and LOVE it!!! The paper is fountain-pen-friendly. The layout is really convenient, with the week on the left and a lined page for notes on the right. The address book in the back is a plus! After going totally electronic for the past few years, I felt the need to get back to basics and love this planner. After this one ends in December 2013, you bet I'll have a 2014 Moleskine in hand. (Also love that it will lay flat.)
B008645YEE|2.0|Music in Batman begins gave an indication that there was more to come as the character developed into a hero then really hit the high mark in The dark knight. I have the collectors addition of that movie and is the best of all three movies, except for the techno remix crap included on the second cd but if you wanted a 'watchful guardian' you payed the man. Dark knight rises is so much remix of the prier dark knight movie it gives nothing new. Unless you want to hear all weirdos who volunteered to do the chant in Gotham's reckoning you will realize after listening to this only once, this is just the same stuff as before.

B0067EKY7M|5.0|Lasse Hallstr&ouml;m, master director of such memorable films as Chocolat, The Cider House Rules, What's Eating Gilbert Grape?, The Shipping News, An Unfinished Life, Hachi: A Dog's Tale, has proven that he understands human frailty and the inherent human comedy we all experience but find so difficult to face.  Working with a script by Simon Beaufoy (The Full Monty, Slumdog Millionaire, Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day, Yasmin, etc) adapted from Paul Torday's popular novel by the same name, and selecting a cast of some of our brightest and worthy character actors in the business, he has created a strange story that is at once full of political satire, relationship studies, fragile human frailties and hope, and in doing so has given us one of the surprise best films of the year.<br /><br />Sheikh Muhammed (Amr Waked, a mesmerizingly fine actor) is a visionary sheik who believes that his passion for the peaceful pastime of salmon fishing can enrich the lives of his people, and he dreams of bringing the sport to the not so fish-friendly desert with the hope that he can make the desert green and a happy home for his people. He has an endless supply of money and instructs his representative Harriet (Emily Blunt) - a bright but relationship-anxious girl who has just started an affair with a soldier, Capt. Robert Mayers (Tom Mison, a dashingly handsome new face on the screen!) - to turn the dream into reality, an extraordinary feat that will require the involvement of Britain's leading fisheries expert Dr. Alfred Jones (Ewan McGregor) who happens to think the project both absurd and unachievable: the naive Alfred is an idealist whose marriage to his sold wife Mary (Rachael Stirling) is one rocky ground. That is, until the Prime Minister's overzealous press secretary Bridget (Kristin Scott Thomas in a brilliant character role) latches on to it as a 'good will' story. Now, this unlikely team will put it all on the line and embark on an upstream journey of faith and fish to prove the impossible, possible.<br /><br />In addition to this extraordinary cast there are tasty cameo roles for Conleth Hill as Alfred's blustering Dickensonian boss Bernard Sugden among others.  The concept of taking unlikely colleagues into a life changing relationship on this adventure dreamed by Sheikh Muhammed is more than tender; it is also very intelligently written romance.  Highly recommended.

B007L3BMGA|3.0|Amateur writing although a good vocabulary. Does raise, albeit superficially, issues to do with lust vs love; autonomy and control, and the impact of childhood trauma on relationships. But all handled superficially and indirectly. Need to suspend belief a lot of the time - hard to believe anyone can have that much sex and still have energy for the rest of life. And what 21 year old wouldn't have an email address!? Characters are thinly drawn and unrealistic - particularly the male protagonist who is perfect in every way apart from his ability to commit to a relationship of love. The plot is sort of compelling so I didn't feel like giving up on the book before the end - and the end did leave me wanting to read the next one to find out what happens next. Warning for those of you who are uncomfortable with explicit sex - there's lot's of it! One potential problem with this book is that it might encourage some women to develop unrealistic expectations of their male partners!

B0043IMW4W|5.0|I love the texas burn style of electric blues guitar. Greats such as SRV , Albert Collins, etc.. that whole  lineage. Which over the years left me feeling like Kenny was just a huge SRV fan who could really really play, and had a mother board programmed into his hands of Stevie riffs, however, thats where I felt it stopped.  He was a copy.  I MUST SAY however, that this is a FANTASTIC live album.  As previously mentioned by other reviewers, the live sound recording on this disc is fantastic. Kenny's guitar tones are thick, precise, and fluid. And the lead vocals are quite increcible on there own. Thick and ballsy like the blues should be.  Definitely a fan of kws, not a super fan as I am of the likes of Stevie Ray Vaughan.  That said, BUY this DISC!  I own a lot of blues albums, and I honestly always find myself popping this one back in the player on the regular.  Only set back, I recently have discovered that VOODOO CHILD was left off the regular version of the CD! and further more, it is not available for download! WTF!??!

1849801223|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo3F6BGQZ3EI468]]<br /><br />YES- BENJAMIN FRANKLIN WOULD BE DELIGHTED BY THIS DICTIONARY OF TERMS ON TAXATION<br /><br />An appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />For many people, taxation raises the blood pressure pretty quickly and a cold streak runs down the back when HMRC or the VAT men call.  So, as Simon James says in the Preface to the second edition of his dictionary of taxation with its 200 new entries, taxes might be the price of civilization being traced back to its beginnings so we will need some guidance on the words the taxers use and what they mean.<br /><br />The intention of this 300 page book is to provide an explanation or description of terms which are commonly used or which provide interesting insights or curiosities in this most important of economic subjects.<br /><br />We believe that the dictionary holds an interest not just for the usual suspects: lawyers, accountants, financial practitioners and advisers and academic but also the general public who are expected to know everything there is about tax as `ignorance of the law is no excuse'.<br /><br />Well, you have a great start here and civil servants/council tax collectors and general tax gatherers should have this book readily available on their desks next to their PC, mouse, paper clips and `in tray' to field answers to the perplexing questions the tax payers asks.<br /><br />That, in itself, would be a great market for the books offers simplicity where a succession of Chancellors of the Exchequer have endeavored to make this subject as difficult as possible to understand.<br /><br />James says that in our modern economies today, taxation can absorb up to a half of national income. This dictionary goes a long way to dispel some of the confusing terminology used in this complex area and we hope it becomes best seller!
0345803493|4.0|This is probably more of a review of the trilogy rather than just this one book, since I can't seem to remember where one book ends and the other begins.  The writing is terrible (though not as terrible as in that other popular series...you know the one, the waitress, the sexy vampires, faeries..) and is extremely repetitive. the \\"...shades of\\" metaphor is over used, hearing about everybody's \\"smirk\\" gets old and for me...I never again want to hear/read the word \\"mercurial\\", however appropriate a descriptor it might be. The writing style is pretty to the point...there's nothing flowery about this. My favorite authors are Toni Morrison and Alice Walker, so this is not a writing style I'm accustomed to. As a result, the story seemed superficial and initially, I expected to hate these books.<br /><br />However...if you like steamy books (and who doesn't?), you'll get sucked in. For all of the poor writing, the character of Christian is magnetic. I found myself incredibly invested in him pretty early on. I can pin point the exact line I became interested in these books...it's in book one and it goes a little like this; \\"I don't make love, I ****...hard\\". Hook, line and sinker, folks. If you're a little more traditional in your reading (or in your taste), the content might be a wee bit (or more) shocking, though in my crew of buddies, none of us were shocked. These books are hot, they're entertaining and you'll probably get sucked. Somewhere down the line in the Amazon reviews, a reviewer uses the term \\"Literary crack\\". that's exactly what this is. LOL. Terrible, but yet, you can't put them down. :)

B008645YEE|2.0|Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy, starting in 2005 with Batman Begins, continuing in 2008 with The Dark Knight, and concluding in 2012 with the Dark Knight Rises, has become one of the most critically acclaimed Batman sagas ever imagined. Based on some of the early reviews for \\"the Dark Knight Rises\\", it seems that it's \\"the Dark Knight\\" will be remembered as the climax of the series, featuring Batman's best villain, Heath Ledger's iconic performance of that villain, and a tight, yet thrilling script that the movie worked off of. That movie was eventually nominated for 8 Oscars: Supporting Actor, Sound Mixing, Sound Editing, Makeup, Cinematography, Visual Effects, Art Direction, and Editing. Why do I mention those accolades? Because it's relevant to why I've always been less than enchanted with the music that Zimmer has written for the series.<br /><br />In recent years, it's become an increasingly accepted axiom that a film score ideally only \\"needs\\" to establish a certain mood, and doesn't need to push any intellectual boundaries or compete with any of the other going-ons in the film. This is in stark contrast with all the other types of artists who work on movies. Makeup artists, art directors, cinematographers,visual effects designers, actors, writers, and directors are all praised for pushing the boundaries of their craft, for developing new methods in their work, for being aware of their place in history, for being able to employ complexity and nuance to good effect, for achieving artistry. This is not so with film composers anymore; at least not with 80% of the blockbuster movies you've seen in theaters over the last 6-8 years. Film music seems to be going backwards rather than forwards, because now film composers achieve fame and success by simplifying their music, pandering to the common denominator, repeating the same boring and ineffective techniques ad nauseum, and sometimes even plagiarizing from their past work. Hans Zimmer was a pioneer in startingthis trend, and the formula used in his score for Batman Begins quickly became an industry standard, so that in post-2005 action/adventure/sci-fi/superhero/fantasy movies, you'll frequently hear music that never deviates from the key of D minor, rarely uproots itself from the bass region, employs tacky electronic effects, and recycles uninspired action motifs from older films.<br /><br />Zimmer has stuck to this formula for all three Nolan Batman films, and the results in \\"the Dark Knight Rises\\" are perhaps even duller than before; possibly because I've heard them in 10 other movies since 2008's \\"the Dark Knight\\". And sadly, whatever potential Zimmer showed in his musical development for \\"the Dark Knight\\" was completely lost when he sat down (by himself this time; James Newton Howard decided to leave the franchise) to write music for \\"the Dark Knight Rises\\". Even if you're a fan of these scores I can't imagine that you'd be anything but slightly underwhelmed by this soundtrack, especially given how much Zimmer has talked it up over the last year.<br /><br />Let's take a look at Zimmer's 2-note them for Batman, which made its first appearance in Batman Begins. In 2011 Zimmer talked about the score, saying \\"Those same two notes have shifted and now provide an answer.\\" Well, I've listened to the soundtrack a few times and I'm sorry to say Zimmer lied. There is one track--track #2, \\"On Thin Ice\\"--that seems to give the theme some minimal development. Zimmer adds a third note to the theme, and changes the harmonic progression. Honestly, it seemed like a pretty promising start to the soundtrack. But the development in this track is nowhere to be heard anywhere else, and Zimmer makes no other attempts to develop the theme. Just like in \\"The Dark Kight\\", Zimmer reprises the 2-note theme at the very end of the soundtrack with very prominent brass, and I just had to laugh and shake my head when I heard it. The theme has become, if possible, *less* effective than it was in Batman Begins. Unlike Bruce Wayne, the simplistic theme has not evolved *at all* which is extremely disappointing. I guarantee you that the director, writers, visual effects designers, art directors, and cinematographers all had a field day with the final scene of the trilogy and tried to make it as powerful of a conclusion as possible. Not Zimmer, who is content as ever to let his music remain stagnant and listless. Indeed, much of the final track of the soundtrack is directly lifted from his previous Batman scores. Anyone who is a fan of the final track in the Dark Knight (my favorite track in this trilogy of soundtracks) should feel let down by the final track here, #15 \\"Rise\\". What a disappointing conclusion to this series of soundtracks.<br /><br />There seem to be two new themes in this score. One is for Bane, and utilizes the chanting voices of thousands of people worldwide that Zimmer collected from the website UJAM. I'm starting to sound like I have a vendetta against Zimmer, but this was a really intriguing idea that ultimately is a letdown. It seems like Zimmer isn't so good with villain themes. In Batman Begins, there was *no* theme for the Scarecrow. In the Dark Knight, his \\"theme\\" for the Joker was really an abrasive, electronic glissando that was unable to portray the moral (or immoral) complexities of that character. Now, his theme for Bane utilizes all of these chanting voices, but leaves them sadly under mixed and not prominent in the musical soundscape at all. The theme only shows up in a couple places on the soundtrack and is not memorable. I'll wait to reserve more judgment for when I see the film.<br /><br />The other new theme is for Catwoman, and utilizies a series of mysterious piano figures as well as a cello motif. The piano is a very welcome break from the near-constant amplified bass, electronic effects, and synthesized violins, and the structure of the theme seems to channel Newton Howard's theme for Harvey Dent in \\"the Dark Knight\\". The theme keeps you guessing, much like the Catwoman character herself. It is reasonably well-developed in track #4 \\"Mind If I Cut In?\\" It is probably the best theme in this franchise, along with the main action theme from \\"the Dark Knight\\" (which can be heard prominently in the trailers for that movie).<br /><br />Production-wise, the music takes the orchestration from Batman Begins to a new extreme. The music features much more electronics than either of the previous scores. This is a bit of a distraction: for the sake of continuity, Zimmer should have maintained a similar sound to the previous scores to strengthen the narrative flow between them. The electronics sometimes comes at the expense of one of Zimmer's more famous techniques in these soundtracks, the constant ostinato in the strings. What I mean by that is that Zimmer replaces ostinato in the strings with ostinato in electronics. As a result, the music is not only jarringly different from the previous scores, but equally boring. The opening track on the album starts off with a \\"swoosh\\"ing effect, very similar to the one that opens the \\"Batman Begins\\" soundtrack. It sounds just as tacky here. I like what electronics can contribute to film scores, but they should be used tastefully. The electronics in Danny Elfman's \\"Spider-Man 2\\" sound refreshing and, frankly, *cool*. Here, they stick out like a sore thumb over the violins (which are generally under-mixed) and are senselessly repetitive. Good luck getting through track #5 \\"Underground Army\\", which could have been cut down to 30 seconds without sacrificing any material.<br /><br />Finally, the action cues deserve a mention. On the album, they are some of the harshest-sounding cues Zimmer has ever penned (or maybe it was his ghostwriters who wrote them. By the way, there are *6 * additional composers on this album besides Zimmer. Why?). The violins play so violently that they sound more like percussion instruments than string instruments. For some people, thesetracks, which include #8 \\"Fear Will Find You\\", will sound nothing less than awesome. But I've noticed that a few film critics have already criticized Zimmer for this harsh technique. Here are some select quotes from them: \\"maddeningly unrelenting percussive score by Hans Zimmer....The Dark Knight Rises is something of an ordeal to sit through.\\" - Dana Stevens. \\"The worst offender here is composer Hans Zimmer, who might as well show up at every showing of this film and bang everyone in the audience over the head with his drum set.\\" - James Verniere. \\"The acoustic balance between the dialogue and composer Zimmer's shut-up-already musical score cannot possibly be what Nolan and his collaborators intended.\\" - Michael Phillips.<br /><br />I wish I didn't care about these soundtracks so much. I wish I could be like the 95% of Amazon reviewers who love these scores by Hans Zimmer and who will undoubtedly vote this review as \\"unhelpful\\". But I can't. After hearing the amazing music that Danny Elfman wrote for Tim Burton's 1989 \\"Batman\\", Hans Zimmer can't possibly convince me that his simplistic, repetitive music is anywhere near as good. After hearing the deliciously dark music that Shirley Walker wrote for \\"Batman: The Animated Series\\", I can't possibly be convinced that Zimmer's harsh, amplified bass music is the superior approach. After hearing how John Williams and Danny Elfman rose to the occasion to write spectacular scores for Superman and Spider-Man, respectively, I just listen to Zimmer's stagnant music and feel disappointed. It might be decades before another reiteration of the Batman franchise comes along that is anywhere near as good as Christopher Nolan's. The music in this trilogy, for me, will always feel like a massive waste of an opportunity for film music.<br /><br />But if you liked the two past scores, don't let me lower your expectations. I'm sure you'll love this one as well. After all, it's so much more of the same.

Prior to reading any book to her I read it first and with this book I thought \\"eeh ... its only ok, nothing special.\\"  However, Mommy was very wrong.  My little one just loves this book.  As soon as we finish reading it she wants me to read it to her again.  When her aunts and uncles visit, she hands this book to them to have them read to her.  Although she is still a little too young to give detailed book review, her actions are clearly that of someone who thinks this book is 5 start worthy.
B0083PQJIQ|4.0|After a number of unsatisfying reads I was almost drooling over this book.  I had seen it being reviewed by a number of trusted reading friends and, while I avoided reading the reviews, there was something about the book that just drew me in.  When I saw it on the Express shelves in my local library just shouting my name - Hazel, read me, read me - I just had to pick it up.<br /><br />Even physically it did not disappoint.  A beautifully covered hardback with the rough edged thick paper inside.  There was nothing about this book that was, so far, letting me down.  I know, you are thinking that I am setting myself up for a big disappointment if the story does not live up to my expectations.  Thankfully it actually did live up to them - woo hoo.<br /><br />Ok the basic concept has been done before, where someone loses their memory when they sleep and they have to solve the mystery that is their life.  Think the movies Memento (Guy Pearce) or even While you were Sleeping (Sandra Bullock) and you would not be wrong the idea is an old one but (and for once it is a good but) this author just seems to get it right.  He manages to get the balance between the emotions of Christine having to live this half life and the conspiracy theory that she believes is going on around her.  The characters are beautifully developed and so well written that I felt I could picture each and every one of them  This is aided by the fact that Christine does not automatically know what each person in her life looks like (or who they actually are) so she writes down a very descriptive journal to remind herself.<br /><br />The story itself was an absolute page turner for me and my sympathies and suspicions kept bouncing back and forwards between three of the main characters - Dr Nash, Ben and Claire - which, I think, is what the author was trying to achieve.  I could actually almost project myself into Christine's mind and felt some of the same confusion that she must have felt each day about what to believe.

Well the ending was good but not mind blowing.  The last 40 or 50 pages were not as good as the other 300 as I guessed most of what was going to happen by then.  Don't let this put you off reading as up to that point I was really torn and had a number of conspiracy theories myself and really cared what happened to most of the characters.<br /><br />A book well worth a read and one that you will inhale as it flows so well.to believe.

B007FZ7R7W|1.0|His music after the Rihanna attack has become so cocky and big headed its just plain annoying! Yes he can deliver some Dance / Pop hits but he is an R&B artist for gosh sake! The same thing is happening to Usher their all jumping the Dancetronica bangwagon!
B000JMKNJ2|4.0|The book starts off a bit slowly.  Locke is involved in an intricate scam to relieve a wealthy couple of some of their fortune and in its own right it is interesting how the deception is played out, but the book tends to linger too long on this part.  Once past this and into the meat of the story, I found it was fast paced and entertaining.  Lynch does a great job with dialog.  The thieves are sarcastic and funny, but they respect and love one another and the dialog sounds natural.  The characters are well fleshed out and feel real.  Lynch weaves chapters in that tell the back story of our main characters.  Sometimes it is off putting when you want to keep reading the main plot, but the back stories are interesting and are usually tangible to the plot at hand.<br /><br />I have a gripe with the bondsmagi which are the magic users in this world.  They seem way too powerful and could pretty much do whatever they want.  I don't know what keeps them in check or why more people don't buy their very expensive services to obtain their goals, although the final encounter with Locke and the bondsmagi is well written if not a bit graphic.<br /><br />The other gripe I have is that things fall into place a bit too tidy.  The last 75 or so pages clean up alot and move at a very fast pace.<br /><br />I would recommend this to any Fantasy reader.  Good start to a series and I'm sure I will pick up the 2nd adventure.

030758836X|5.0|I'm not a good writer myself, so I'm not able to produce a review that would do this book justice.  Just do yourself a favor and read it.  Set aside some blocks of uninterrupted time though; you truly will NOT want to put this book down.<br /><br />I listened to the audiobook version of this book via Audible.com.  The two narrators were wonderful, and the production quality was excellent.  Don't be afraid that the narrator(s) will ruin the book; if you enjoy audiobooks, you won't be disappointed.

1858705223|5.0|I pre ordered this months before it even came out, january to be exact and no notice was sent to me about it being shipped so i cancelled that one and ordered another one. All i can say is the album is awesome. classic slash riffs straight foreward rock and roll. In my opinion there aren't really any filler songs. Now on to the fan pack, it comes with a pretty big double sided poster, one side slash with his guitar, the other, slash and myles kennedy, which by the way is a really phoenomenal vocalist. The fan pack also comes with a really cool pin no larger than about the size of a quarter, then theres the magazine with plenty of interviews of slash, myles and the conspirators and also a look at slash's favorite guitars which is a real treat for guitar players and slash fans alike. I'm not sure if there are any brand new fan packs still out there but if you have a chance get yours, it wont dissapoint you.

0345803493|3.0|If you are interested in romatic erotica, Mills and Boon does really good ones - and they just did a series called 12 Shades of Surrender for Fifty Shades fans.<br /><br />The triology drags a little too long - though it is suppose to all happen wirhin weeks, months. There are a lot of \\"cocks his head to one side (68)\\", and lips biting, and \\"holy s***/f***/cow/crap (347)\\" in the book. She finds everything about him \\"hot\\", and her mouth is constantly dry. It does make this a little repetitive...<br /><br />Basically this is a teenage fantasy - a young girl, brave girl who is not afraid of anything, managed to let a guy who has everything but confidence, to open himself up to her and changed the way he behaved.<br /><br />If you are looking for erotica with BDSM - this may not be for you - Ana is not submissive. If you are looking for more hard core erotica - not for you either, the description of the sexual activites is a little week.<br /><br />I got a little bored half way through and just glanced through the descriptions - I did manage the read the whole book just to see what happened to Ana and Christian at the end of this.<br /><br />I support women writers who write erotica for women - but as a writer, I was hoping for a little more description, better use of words, and really engage the readers into this fantasy world.<br /><br />It did get me all hopelessly romantic - but I think it is because I have been thinking how I could do better.
0688014291|5.0|Sooner or later every manager or leader reads Blanchard. I got into his work because he promotes Anthony Robbins. I also saw him in person at a seminar; his inspired me to honest tears. His books may be pricey, but that is because he said he didn't want to write 10 dollar books. His value is seen in the fact that people finish his books due to their smaller size and their interesting stories. One of the most helpful in this one is his discussion between leaders and ducks. It is an unforgettable lesson.

B004UPANAI|2.0|This was a cool movie with interesting concepts, but there were too many things about that kept it from being a great movie!<br />What I liked about this movie:<br />1. Hugh Jackman gave us an excellent performance as Wolverine<br />once again!<br />2. Ryan Reynolds was great as Deadpool!<br />3. The visual effects were great!<br />4. Most of the under foot actors were great!<br />5. Gambit was awesome!<br /><br />What I didn't like about the movie was:<br />1. My biggest complaint is; what the heck did they do to Deadpool<br />at the end of the movie?!?!<br />2. Most of the action sequences in the movie felt forced!<br />3. They under used too many characters!<br />4. The movie kept building-up and building-up, but the pay off in<br />the end was not satisfying!<br />5. I am still confused if this is a reboot or a prequel to the first<br />three movies...!<br />6. Too many dull moments/ the pace was not good!<br /><br />Bottom line: While Hugh Jackman gives us a great performance<br />once again, most of the other elements in this movie were<br />not good!<br />My grade: C or two stars!
B004J1DBJI|1.0|Cannot find anything!!!  Could not find WWll, World, Martin L. King, World History, and the only subject you can select is history!!!!  Couldn't even find Hitler!!!  All it could find were two songs!!!!  This is a waste!  I want my money back as soon as possible!  This is a rip-off!!!
B000I9U8VO|5.0|While the first X-Men movie was cool, the plot didn't hold the movie up that much,<br />and it could have had better battle sequences, this one made up for all of that<br />in the end!<br /><br />What I liked about this movie was:<br />1. Every actor in this movie was great!<br />2. Each character severed a great purpose!<br />3. The plot held the movie up excellently!<br />4. The action was stunning!<br />5. The visual effects were better!<br />6. More of the characters from the first movie got better<br />screening time!<br />7. I loved the entire opening sequence with Nightcrawler<br />attacking the White House!<br />8. The raid in the mansion was cool!<br />9. Magneto escaping from his prison was great!<br />10. I loved Pyro's fury on the police!<br />11. The battle between Deathstryke and Wolverine was priceless!<br /><br />This was the best of the X-Men movies! I loved it and sall it five<br />times in theaters in 2003!<br />My grade: A or five stars!
B007SGM084|5.0|I loved the Fifty Shades of Grey Trilogy. Couldn't stop reading it once I started.I didn't want the books to end. I don't kmow what to read after it. not sure if anything will compare.
B000JFDBXO|4.0|I think for the most part, this movie fell prey to hype!<br />The director was trying to please too many fans, and when he tried<br />to give the fans what they wanted, they were disappointed with<br />it. The same thing with Spider-Man 3... I just watched this<br />movie to be entertained, I really enjoyed it!<br /><br />What I liked about it was:<br />1. Every actor in the movie was great with their character!<br />2. The action sequences were hard core!<br />3. The visual effects just keep getting better and better<br />with each movie!<br />4. Each character served a great purpose in the end!<br />5. I'm glad to see that both Magneto and Mystique got what<br />they deserved... they lost their powers!<br />6. The movie focused well on it's two plots: the Dark Phinoex<br />and the mutant cure!<br />7. The battle of ice and fire between Pyro and Ice Man was priceless!<br />8. Most of the new characters (Calisto, Juggernaut, and Beast) got some good<br />screening time!<br />9. It's about time we have an X-Men movie that was full of action and explosions!<br />10. I love how Wolverine stepped up to the plate and was a leader!<br /><br />What I didn't like was:<br />1. Colossus and Angel were not given enough to do!<br />2. The movie could have had a better wrap-up for an ending!<br /><br />Bottom line: People were expecting too much out of this movie and that is why some said it<br />sucked! But I personally enjoyed it! With a few minor flaws though...<br />My grade: B+ or four stars!
B000JMKRKC|5.0|I took this book camping, and could not put it down. The sisters relationship was astounding and had a unique twist.  I hope the author continues with her craft.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book was amazing.  I could relate to Anastasia in more ways than one.  I love how BDSM has been brought to the eyes of the Vanilla world.  It is very erotic and amazing when shared with the right partner.  I love how this has opened many people's eyes.  I just could not get enough.  Ready to read the sequal.
0896898288|1.0|I am just beginning this quilt.  I am a teacher and very experienced quilter, but this book is very lacking in instructions.  No where does it say what size the block is other than 6\\"--is that finished or unfinished.  I printed out all the templates at 100% as directed.  They are not the properly sized to make a 6 1/2\\" unfinished block.  I would not recommend this book to anyone, and I am real sorry I bought it and wasted my money.  I have made template quilts before and have even taught them.  Each block was perfect.  My first block in this book was 6 1/4 x 6---oops.  Templates and seams are exact--sizes given are totally wrong.  DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK.
B007H9B8FS|4.0|I've waited long enough for this album. Was the album worth the wait? For me it was! I wasn't expecting much because as much as I love their last album, BeautifulGarbage just didn't do it for me and I didn't want to get my hopes up... But it turns out I truly enjoy this album. It may not be my favorite, but I've been a fan of Garbage ever since the band was created and this sounds exactly like Garbage, to me anyways. My favorite tracks are I Hate Love, Man on a Wire & Sugar.<br /><br />I agree with other reviews saying that if you don't know Garbage, maybe you should start with their first album, version 2.0 or even Bleed Like Me. But if you're a fan, you'll love it.
1594484805|5.0|This book was a fast read and provided much insight into what truly motivates us. Daniel Pink does a great job of spelling out what needs to be done in order to get the best results.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Great game. I recommend it to anyone that likes puzzles. Very entertaining Love it. This game is challenging. Children would like it too.
B0086700CM|5.0|I don't see why people are trashing this game. its like it freezes once for only two seconds and its a one star app. this is an amazingly fun app. I know you should get it. its easier than apples version too, I do like both versions though.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this game. it so addicting! I can play this game for hours if my kindle didn't die ever like 3 hours.
B007L3BMGA|5.0|Hands down one of the best books I have ever read. It's really raunchy which is great but that aside the storyline is even more compelling. You get completely caught up in how the characters evolve and what makes them the way they are. Could not put this down and ended up reading the trilogy in less than a week. Quite simply brilliant and I really hope to see more from this author.
B00785P2QC|5.0|awesome I'm loving it!!!!! I will be playing this for awhile I'm recommending to everyone I know. good job guys!
B007L3BMGA|1.0|this is a very poor story with a bit of sexual fantasy put in to keep the reader interested after the first episode in the playroom it got so boring , sorry would not recommend , its a big yawn, are we the sad people to have been hoodwinked by the publicity that went about this book
B007MAETA8|5.0|If you still think that John Mayer is a hokey teen-pop star who sings about puppy love amid a sea of blankets, then you urgently need to give him another listen.<br /><br />This album is quite good. \\"Queen of California\\" is probably the best track-- its final 75 seconds of complexly layered guitar will make you melt. \\"If I Ever Get Around to Living\\" has the rare and gratifying combination of delicacy and soulfulness. \\"Walt Grace's Submarine Test\\" is one of the best story songs since Bob Dylan's \\"Boots of Spanish Leather.\\"<br /><br />This album has more of a folksy and country taste than his others, but it's subtle and varied. There is pedal steel on three tracks (Queen of California, Shadow Days, and Whiskey Whiskey Whiskey) and lap steel on another (Born and Raised). I don't recall if this is JM's first time using steel guitar, but he uses it well. In fact, my only complaint is that he doesn't use it often enough.<br /><br />Continuum is still his best album, and it isn't really close, but Born & Raised is a worthy and timely addition. Given the rapid musical desertification that is occurring at the hands of dance-pop glitz infested radio, Born & Raised comes as an intensely quenching and relieving swig of cool water. We should support this album for that reason alone-- to show that we still crave popular music that has soul.<br /><br />P.S. - If you adore this album, then you'd probably also adore a similarly folksy and steel-guitar-y album from Ray LaMontagne: [[ASIN:B003QCCS36 God Willin' & The Creek Don't Rise]].
B007EC27QM|5.0|I use for business and engineering. Works fine! I'm glad I purchased it. Swipe finger over memory buttons and it goes to advanced functions.
B007N85ZXY|4.0|This album is very interesting to listen to.  Neil depicts  the American old west in a different light instead of carefree songs like the standard version of OH Susannah, Tom Dooley, etc.. Neil has written his own version  of these tunes which tend to be slightly gruesome perhaps more reminiscent of the real American West of hundred years ago.
B0063IH60K|3.0|It's a good way to waste time, it's just a classic go to game.  I mean it's solitaire, not the most exciting game.
0345803485|1.0|Why am I so curious? I like being curious, in that it's better than the alternative. But buying this book illustrates the downsides of curiosity: subjecting myself to really really really bad prose.<br /><br />So I'll read some two or three entire Tolstoy books just to make up for all the bad prose I had to endure in the 105 pages I read of Fifty Shades of Grey. Curiosity is giving way to snobbishness - and that's better than the alternative, which is reading crap.
B007X4ECLY|5.0|this was just a fun movie to watch from beggining to end. it is as it was said to be a 'bladerunner' and 'taken' put together in one film. luc besson the great director of 'leon aka the proffessional' does a great futuristic fun filled movie that doesnt let up. pierce is just fun to watch as a guy who must rescue the presidents daughter from a prison full of murderrers in space. if your a fan of scifi, this movie is a must see.
B008JGSM6G|3.0|like I said its good but to much thinking you have to think every minute it is a game not school and to many levels it takes like a year to finish it
B0087DFIOU|5.0|this was a great action packed over the top movie. for me, this would have been a part 2 to 'payback'. in this film he is a thief and he also narrates as the film goes on. mel starts the movie with a gr8 chase from the law that winds him in the toughest of situations. he must use his street smarts and his talents as his tools to survive. this was a straight to dvd film which feels more like a big screen blockbuster to me. evrything was well acted, lots of black humor and action. a great film for the old school mel gibson action fan. mel goes back to his roots and proves to us all that he still has it!!!
B006LSZECO|4.0|I just finished reading Gillian Flynn's book, Gone Girl, and thought I would add my comments to the others that have been made.  What a wild, exciting and twisting tale of two rather needy/sick characters!  It was definitely hard to put down and kept one's interest from beginning to end.<br />Not being one of this new generation of young adults, I did find the use of the 'f' word a bit overused.  This may be how these folks talk everyday, but what appalled me was how many times and in how many different ways it was used......noun, verb, adjective, etc.  Ms. Flynn writes so well and is so descriptive but that word was just a downer for me.  I wonder if she could write without quite so much of its use.<br />I can see a sequel coming possibly---just hope she can cut down on that word....I think others would serve the purpose.
034580404X|5.0|I am not a book reader, normally.  A lot of people I knew were reading this series and kept talking about it, I had to find out what the fuss was about.  I can't put it down, I am starting book 3 and am addicted.  If you are iffy about book 1 and are not sure you want to continue in the series, give book 2 a shot, it just gets better.
1401308600|4.0|It is not as applicable to my industry as I first thought it might be, however it helps understand the marketplace and the dramatic changes going on right now.
B0083GVG6K|5.0|Love watching it on my Kindle. Hope it isn't cancelled anytime soon. I have a problem with that . . . . . get attached to a good show and - voila - it's gone!
B00701L5XS|5.0|Great app for boat owners, fisherman, and outdoors use. I keep it on my android home page for quick reference.  The 3D animations are easy to follow.
B006ZCWU5K|5.0|\\"My work is about judging the distance between the American reality and the American Dream\\" Bruce Springsteen.  Bruce reminds me of a modern day Woody Guthrie and is one of the last few social/politic song writers that I am aware of.  The songs reflect different characters surviving the Great Recession such as Easy Money, Jack of all Trades and Death to My Hometown.  Musically, the songs incorporate diverse styles from horn sections to Celtic rhythms.  It is an interesting and entertaining listen.  That is why it is my Favorite Bruce Album in Years!
B0086700CM|5.0|this is so cool i recommend it to anyone who loves to play games this is even better on a kindle fire than anythind else its awesome
B0007ACVHI|5.0|Bach's Cello Suites are marvelous and enjoyable pieces of music. First of all, this recording has excellent sound quality, which distinguishes it from the classic interpretations by Casals and Starker; so on that score, Kliegel's is much preferred.<br /><br />I find her interpretations to be poetic and song-like, with a fidelity to the Baroque aesthetic of the scores (i.e., not romanticized), but certainly not any kind of rigid purism. For me, just the right blend of rhythm and melody and beauty. I admit I haven't heard Rostropovich's interpretation of the Bach Suites, so I can make any comparisons there. But this is probably the only recording I need.
B007G51UV0|5.0|It is a very good motherboard. I like this one. But one thing maybe need to pay attention is the SATA sockets are on the side.

B0063IH60K|4.0|I like this game because u can choose a winning deal or random. Its nice for whatever mood ur in.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I love sex and I love to read. After the barrage of hype, I had to at least take a look. I read the first few pages, available to look at and they were AWFUL. Extremely poorly written and so boring. She is obviously a tv producer...writing in the present tense gives that away. I'll bet this started as a screenplay that never made it, then she made it into a novel. Just goes to show, success can have little to nothing to do with talent and everything to do with good publicity....50 Shades of Grey is the Kardashians of novels...<br /><br />ps....to ask if a teen wrote this is an insult to teens!! I've read plenty of good teen writers that are better than this on authonomy.com

B007JRU2UK|5.0|I now understand why George Clooney was nominated for an Oscar. This screenplay, the story, the setting, direction and above all, the performances of all those in the cast, were brilliant. I am not quite sure why I waited so long to see The Descendants. I highly recommend it to you.
B00701L5XS|3.0|I Revised This review for the developer, as he asked me nicely to..I uninstalled it, not an App for me. I still think it had spyware in it.
0061733199|2.0|the good:<br /><br />This book is crammed full of great survival information, It really does cover pretty much every survival scenario, A great reading book but that is about it.<br /><br />The bad:<br /><br />Alot of the information contained in it is outdated, sub-par, unfinished or just plain wrong. I will not go into every example of what i found wrong with the book as it would take way too long to point everything out but i will give a few examples.<br /><br />My biggest was on the fungi, This section should have never even been included. Firstly, a spore print among other diagnostic tools are essential for proper identification of mushrooms. Secondly mushrooms while providing a high mineral & vitamin content they are for the most part (80-90%) water, there fore you must eat quiet alot to receive such vitamins & minerals, they are also low in calories, fat and protein so not a very good energy food. (something the book got wrong)<br />Lastly mushrooms are great at absorbing heavy metals and harboring bacteria/mold that you cannot see with your naked eye so unless your stranded with a team of Mycologists the book should have simply told you to stay away from them. however the book hails fungi as a quick easy resource with minimal risk and maximum payoff.<br /><br />preparing game, they have about 3 pages devoted to this and makes it seem super easy, I assure you its not. They also from my best understanding recommends skinning then gutting (which is backwards)<br /><br />Just a few examples, as i said im not going to list all of them.<br /><br />the ugly:<br /><br />The layout of the book is so completely confusing and follows no guideline, its all just thrown together. For example twords the beginning on the survival kit it starts with a nice numerical list of items, each item having its own little paragraph to help identify with a proper picture, that's awesome, really great for quick reference. The very next page the format changes to just lumping a few intoa single paragraph. the format just wildly jumps throughout the book. Its really difficult to follow.<br /><br />Also the book will mention something, then go to something entirely different for a few paragraphs before completing the first topic.<br /><br />Aside from that its chapters are way out of order if you was to read cover-to-cover. It assumes greatly that you have survival supplies in the beginning like say rope. It uses rope quite a bit in the book but only about halfway through does it even briefly mention how to make rope. Shouldn't that have been mentioned before how to use it?<br /><br />In conclusion there is alot of STARTER info but then you pretty much gotta know how to use it, its like saying \\"here, read this brief paragraph but then go do further research on your own\\" Really it was a great read but do not assume this is an end all survive all book. Really wish I could give a higher review.
B005UBNKZG|5.0|I was using a phenom II 965 for a while and just installed this recently. The phenom II of course did everything well but I can see a noticeable difference with this. My download rates about doubled and my temperatures are about 10 degrees less on idle and when stressed cause this thing is hardly working. This laughs at the workloads that would stress out my last cpu! Max temps are in the upper 30's with water cooling after prime95. When it idle's it's right around room temperature. I haven't tried overclocking yet but I'm gonna hold off on that until I find something that this processor will have trouble handling. I haven't had any trouble at all and so far I love having this in my system! It's paired with a 990fx board and it's a great combination. I haven't tried gaming yet but my video card is outdated, so it's not worth mentioning fps until I do my next upgrade. If I had to complain it would be that the tin has a hole in the side to look at the cpu, so I can't use it for other things... Also I hear the heatsink is terrible but that's why I'm not using it.<br /><br />If you're looking to upgrade from a quadcore then this isn't a bad choice at all. Don't expect it to keep up with an i7 but for what this does I don't know why you would want to spend $100 more for something a little better. If you want to wait I'm sure that the next generation of processors will be awesome as well. Otherwise I highly recommend upgrading to this. It's working extremely well for me!

B00004Z400|5.0|Deftones White Pony is one of the greatest musical creations from any genre or band. It takes you for a ride as you listen, and when its over you feel different than before, in a good way. This and Around The Fur are the Deftones albums to get if you can't decide. Such beautiful, epic songs. If this isnt in your collection, I suggest leaving right now and heading to your local music store to buy this right now. I'm serious.

Great for multi tasking, data processing, editing, and other various tasks.<br />* 16mb total cache. That's a good amount of cache, considering the price.<br /><br />TH FX 6100 performs well. I primarily use the PC for gaming, video editing,and video production. It has not disappointed. Highly recommended!
B004I4H8QI|5.0|There seems to be a major resurgence of interest in 1970s music as today's 15-25 year olds rediscover music from that decade. I grew up in the 70s and my friends' teenaged sons and their friends are now frequently asking me about 70s bands and looking for lesser known bands and albums from that era.<br /><br />Derek and the Dominoes is one band I've told them about.<br /><br />This 1970 release is one of the essential albums for any collection of 1970s music but it's also one of the best blues guitar albums ever released, period.<br /><br />The guitarists and vocalists on this album were Eric Clapton and Duane Allman, both of whom rank solidly amongst the best rock and blues guitarists of the day. Eric Clapton is still a leading guitarist; Duane Allman would probably still be prominent in music circles if a road accident hadn't ended his life at far too young an age.<br /><br />Many people are probably familiar with the title track, Layla, from radio play but aren't familiar with the rest of this album. For those who haven't heard this album, there are no weak tracks on it. It's just first rate music and first rate musicianship throughout.<br /><br />For anyone discovering/re-discovering 1970s music, this is one of the essential albums for your collection.

B008MEM24S|5.0|This is a great game if you enjoy where's my water.  Works great on my kindle fire as well as my daughter's.
1781161097|4.0|The book shows a lot about pre-production, but I miss some photos that we can find online. The drawings are very dark (color and contrast), and don't show all the aspects of the movie.
145210655X|5.0|Darth Vader and son was obviously written by someone who is both a dedicated Star Wars fan and a parent.  The humor is warm, the background details of the images are full of clever references, and the quality of the art and writing sustains throughout the book.  I bought this for my brother for Father's Day, then had to get a copy myself.
B004RJMUJO|5.0|This game is so addictive. i just want to keep doing it over and over to beat my own score! you will find it hard to stop the slicing fun!! give it a try

6305428050|4.0|This is a little hidden gem of a movie.  It starts with a wonderful opening scene of Elisabeth Shue's character dancing  in her bedroom to the Crystals' \\"Then He Kissed Me\\" as she dresses for her date.  Very memorable, very romantic, and so well done that you almost feel guilty for peeping into a young girl's boudoir!  There is no nudity in this scene or at any other point in the movie, BTW.  Elisabeth is the ultimate Girl Next Door, winsome, funny, and very beautiful, and she carries the movie very well.  Without giving too much of the plot away, the \\"adventures\\" of the title are as a whole quite hilarious.  The situations that the cast finds themselves in are all over-the-top and often ridiculous, but in a very amusing way.  Along the way, look for a great turn by a young Vincent D'Onofrio, long before his 'Criminal Intent' role, and almost unrecognizable.  The supporting cast of child actors are all very well cast, and help to add to the general humorous, warm tone that the movie sets.  Penelope Ann Miller, a wonderful actress, is cast in a rather one-dimensional role as Elisabeth's friend in trouble, but she is VERY funny in it, and, in keeping with the general tone of the movie, hilariously over the top.  See her in 'Awakenings' for a much better showcase for her talents.  There are some memorable secondary characters along the way as well.  All in all, a very funny, warm flick, suitable for family night or even as a date movie, and one with good replay value, as the cast is so likable and funny, and the situations they find themselves in so outrageously funny.  The only real caveat is that for no good reason in a family movie, some bad language is used here and there, so if you are thinking of watching this with small children, you might want to screen it first.
B000HF2NF8|5.0|V for Vendetta from comic to movie. when you see the movie don't think it's power hero like super-man. This another hero with a sytle .. used masked. And i love buy this edition off course a lot bonus like mask and card insert it. But it's dvd not blu-ray.
038572179X|2.0|I expected so much more from this book, given the glowing reviews on amazon and in the media. The first part is very well written, especially when describing the house and gardens and the English countryside on a summer day shortly before WWII.<br />However, most of the characters are so annoying, exept Robbie. And how is it that the police believe the story of a 13 year old child, resulting in a man being sent to jail? Surely they would and should investigate somewhat more closely and thoroughly, despite the class difference of the accuser and the accused? I had a hard time swallowing this.<br />The book moves very slowly and the ending, which I unfortunately envisioned as one of the scenarios, was very unsatisfying - but most likely the only possible one. Nobody really atoned, though. I wished I had gotten the book at the library first, as I finally gave it away.
B002LW9ITY|5.0|who didn't know PIXAR. Cars makes car looks live with a lot of mimic . with gift set 2 cars figure. Transfer movie 5/5 audio 5/5 and 4/5 feature. Love it .. buy it if you liked
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I really didn't expect much from a battery app, but this one provides some very useful stats.  It can track battery usage by app and chart total charge over time.
0451228375|5.0|I was waiting to be disappointed (the second book is never as good, right).  But I was very pleasantly surprised.  When I finished I felt a sense of relief - it's VERY long - but then I was sad.  I wanted another book!  I moved on to Fall of Giants (which is also incredibly good).  Now I have to wait for Winter of the World.  I've never read his other books.  Not much of a spy novel kind of person but I may have to give them a try.  Never thought I was an 11th century cathedral building monks kind of person either!  Ken Follett has made me one!
B0011Z32PS|4.0|all of Metallica\\"s albums up to this one are all good this one included after this they went to shit as far as im concerned anything after this is a waste of time even AJFA which sounds like shit due to bad production is better than the bullshit they have out nowadays Lars drumming ability has gone WAYYYY down he cant keep a beat to save his ass anymore Mettalica WAS a great band now they are washed up time to get out boys you suck just my opinion
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great Book I Recommend . Amazon is Awesome !!! Keeps you wanting to keep reading not boring at all Cant wait to see the Movie now .
0880796863|5.0|The best tarot deck for people who want to start out in this category of divinitation. This was my favorite when I started out.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I saw this on the App store last night and picked it up for fun. When my husband saw me playing, he loved it and picked it up on our iPad as well. I played it a little last night and a little this morning, and I'm now on level 99. How did that happen?<br /><br />It's very easy at first, but the levels build in difficulty as you play. This will definitely be a game I pick up again and again -- or I may have to pick up the paid version to get more levels.<br /><br />It's a simple concept: connect each pair of like-colored dots without any of the lines (or pipes, as they call them) running into each other. It's fun to figure out which moves come first and how to progress in each level. And then you'll play \\"just one more\\" for probably far too long!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This has been one of the best books i have read in a long time. buy it! You wont be disappointed!!! -Harper
1466401885|1.0|This is quite possibly the dumbest book I have ever read.  The only reason I finished it was that I kept imagining that somehow it just had to get better.  It doesn't. The subject matter and writing are juvenile at best.  Perhaps if you are not over the age of 18, it might hold your interest.  Otherwise, don't waste your time or money.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|excellently done. please download. easy to both read and use. clear buttons for adding and subtraction multiplying and division.  love the memory. recommend an immediate download
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I love using this keyboard and the word predictions.  The arrows have spoiled me now I really hate typing on my itouch (even more).  Definitely a great app to test out.  I use the neon keyboard with small keys and arrows on. HTC EVO

B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Angry Birds is fun and easy to play. I'm well into adulthood, and still find myself playing this game. It's fun and challenging to go back and try to get all the stars.
B007I2BZIE|4.0|Great album. Worth owning. Close to 5 stars but not quite.  Rush is the best but b/c that's the case, their standards are quite high.  It rocks!!  Get it.
B00701L5XS|3.0|Why is it that the users who downloaded the app when it was free have so many complaints, while the people who purchased it have only praise?<br /><br />Seems like the people who spent money on it would be more likely to complain, but apparently a closed wallet = an open mouth.
0307949486|4.0|This is a thrilling murder mystery novel. I had heard reviews that it was a slow novel, so some people had trouble getting through it, but I disagree. In the opening few chapters, there is a lot of background information introduced, so at times it can be a bit tedious in the details, but besides that I thought it read quiet quickly and was very entertaining.<br />Blomkvist, a journalist, after being convicted of slander, is thrown into a prominent family's interpersonal dilemma: who killed Harriet Vanger. Blomkvist must leaf through a complicated and twisted family history, uncovering horrible secrets about once trusted family members. Helping him with his quest, is the introverted asocial hacker Salander. Her photographic memory helps Blomkvist put together clues in determining what happened to Harriet. The conclusion is frustrating for Blomkvist, but he manages, with Salander's help, to redeem himself after being convicted of slander.<br />I enjoyed this novel, even after having read the third book first by mistake. However, I do want to let individuals know that if you have struggled with sexual violence of any sort, there are some pretty graphic scenes that can be hard to get through.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I enjoyed this book.  The violence is very graphic.  It is a dour little story.  The heroine is not likeable; the plot unusual; the writing satisfactory.  On reflection, I should have identified the murderer; it was all there.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|this game is amazing. very addictive. at first its too easy and then it eventually becomes impossible. great for problem solvers. bad for those impatient ones like me! its free though so you might as well download it! :)
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Forget Twilight, Hunger Games or Harry Potter..they don't have anything on Fifty Shades of Grey! Fifty Shades has to be the BEST series I have ever read. I am on the third book now and can't imagine not having another book to continue the series. It is hot, steamy, and erotic..Christian and Ana's relationship is a fairytale that women wish they lived in. I think the series would be great for men to read as well. Hold on to your pants ladies and you might want a napkin for the drool. Babies will be booming after this book.
B005HSL626|5.0|what are you doing just reading this comment? buy the free game for crying out loud! this game is highly addictive and fun when bored! and its freeeeeeee!
B0083GQKQG|3.0|Dark movie, know what you are getting into.  Not bad if you like a bit of shock an a feeling of remorse at the end
B005K17RU0|4.0|It's a great app. The only problem I have is the motion on the radar map is to quick, other than that it works just fine.
B0086700CM|1.0|i used to play this on my brothers ipad and i loved it. my mom got me the kindle fire instead of the ipad for my brithday. when i downloaded temple run onto my kindle i noticed that the screen shakes every two to three seconds...i told my mom to play and i watched and it did the same thing. temple run sucks on the kindle fire :(
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|It was fun and easy and I wanted it to keep going.  People can be such book snobs.  They can't all be literary genius!  I read a lot of books.  Some are good, some are okay and some stand out! This one was fun and totally worth reading.  I preorded book two when I finished this one.  Can't wait to start it!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I enjoyed every book in the trilogy and the last book did not let me down. This is definitely a must read.
034580404X|2.0|Want to avoid the download cost? See if your library offers digital books for Kindle. Mine did and I read all 3 books. Too much sec. I 'm an adult and do not need a play by play. Story was just ok. Glad to not have bought this series. Even in print form I would have wasted money. If I met a man like Christian Grey I would get a restraining order sn Anastasia. Needed more self esteem and alife
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I justed finished book 2 and wanted to get started on book 3 immediately. Within minutes, I had purchased and downloaded this book to my iPhone through the Kindle app. The hustle and bustle of the way our lives are today we only get a handful of minutes to ourselves and that's all it took to get me started on the next book.
B006GHA9QQ|5.0|I know most of my friends don't like Andrew Lloyd for some reasons, but I think the guy is great. Now Love Never Dies is a new story and after 10 years they comming back again, but not London, instead New York. The play is not a movie like the previous one, is more like a play from broadway. The music was really good, beautiful customs and the stage set up modern type. I believe Andrew Lloyd can go beyond by producing more plays and beautiful things, but for some reasons, he still behind with the Phantom.
B004TTMYQG|5.0|Best by far of several paid calendars I tried. I need excellent calendar functionality for my business and this application has it.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I listen to this while I sleep* its easy to use.,has so many<br />different versions and so convenient to use. I have this app on my Iphone and kindle fire. Love love this app. I use it daily
034580404X|5.0|Ordered this trilogy for my wife (duh). Brand new in wrapping. Set as advertised. She is happy (so am I). What else can you say?
B001EC2ISA|3.0|I only remember it from watching it in the past, but wanted a copy of it to watch with my grandchildren.  Of course, I'll watch it first to review! -
0345803485|5.0|Love all three!!!! Read them twice. Heard they are coming out with a movie. I hope so, can't wait! Have some ideas of who could play Christian
0345803485|1.0|Just finished the trilogy Fifty Shades of Grey.These are by far the most offensive attempts at literary lunacy I have ever read. Asside from the obvious fact that the plot is lacking, the \\"adult\\" material is laughable and downright redunant. I think Ms. EL James should invest in a thesaurus. Has anyone ever counted the following words found in these books:muttered, murmered, hissed, breathed, whispered? In addition to the above comments, I think the books glamorize this deviant relationship. Just my \\"2 cents\\" :)
B008IYOEZM|5.0|This season started out slow, but ended great! I give this season five stars because of the last few episodes. I can't wait for season 7!
B002PHVAQY|3.0|Seems a bit under-powered but that could be due to low output from the pickup.  Like other reviewers, I'd recommend good quality buds or preferably headphones.  Tone control has little effect.  The \\"acoustic\\" simulator is interesting but I probably wouldn't use it all the time.  One thing that bugs me is that the 1/4\\" phone plug isn't long enough to fully engage into my guitar's jack.  When measured against other plugs, it looks like it's almost 1/16\\" shorter.
0312360258|4.0|I'm going to make this short and kinda bittersweet.<br />I'm 3 days in this book and its good so far. My only problem is that HIGH SCHOOL KIDS DO NOT TALK LIKE THIS. Seriously. If that's the case, this shouldn't be an 13 and up book category.
B007N0REX6|5.0|To me, Slash's sound is so unique - it gave GNR so much of its flavor, and these days when I listen to Appetite for Destruction it sounds more like a Slash album with Axl singing than a GNR album.  Myles Kennedy never appealed to me in Alter Bridge, but he really shines on this release.  If you've ever liked any song with Slash playing on it, I think you'll like this stuff!
B006R8GK2Q|2.0|I would give it a 3 but the constant pop up to post on facebook is annoying.  If I wanted to play a facebook game, I would get on facebook and play.  Storyline....I've seen better.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|Waiting for Castle to settle down with Beckett... but Castle has failed marriages so he is gun shy and Becket won't trust Castle unless Castle commits fully. Will they ever get together? Stay tuned! lol. In the meantime see them perry with each other while catching even the craftiest baddies. I have to admit I'm just starting on Season 3 and I do miss some of the extreme cockiness of the Castle from Season 1 (calling in favors and acting like a diva). Did I mention that Molly has the most amazing red hair?
0345803485|1.0|I'm a masochist because I am making myself read this trilogy even though I hate these books. I'm the type who has to see everything through to the end no matter how unenjoyable it is.  Therefore reading these books is a form of torture. Like everyone else I picked up 50 Shades out of curiosity. Less then half way through I was ready to throw it into the fireplace. A lot of people call the books stupid, but I would use the adjectives ridiculous and inane.  The characters are incredibly annoying and like no human I have ever met. They are empty shells that have sex a lot, too much really. EL James managed to make the sex so boring and repetitive, the opposite of what she intended, that after the first ten sex scenes I just skimmed the rest in a hurry to get to the end. The sex is fantasy alright. What woman has a mind blowing orgasm the first time? No one I know.  Sex is all these two have together and they have confused it for love which is why they decide to get married after what? a couple of weeks?<br /><br />They want to make a movie of this mess?  How? It will have to be X rated or the screen play will have to be completely rewritten which might be a good thing.  I won't go see it as I know it will be a bomb, a waste of movie money and I would hate to throw up in a theater.<br /><br />Funny, I read the Hunger Games trilogy before the Grey trilogy and loved it. I thought it was very well written, wonderfully imaginative and the characters well defined. Pick up those books instead of the Grey series.<br /><br />Normally, I'm against all book burning, but the 50 Shades trilogy is such trash that it would make good kindling.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|It is at times challenging and always fun.  it can be very addicting. I was on the rocks about it because it looked kind of boring, but totally fun. If you choose to get it you wont be dissapointed!!!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|very addicting so you will kill a lot of time the only issue I have had was some controls don't work well
B007IXWKUK|1.0|A lot of girls at my work started reading this trilogy and they all liked it.  When I started to read them, I though surely to goodness this is going to get better.  What a big disappointment.  Don't waste your time.  Stop after you finish book one.  The trilogy was a struggle.  Way too predictable, unrealistic and boring.  I would actually skip through the sex scenes...enough already!  Give me a story line.  Not soft porn.  This story line could of been covered in one book, not three.  I also found the e-mails between the two of them, a waste of time.<br /><br />My biggest question is how in the world are they going to make a movie out of this????  X-Rated perhaps.  I think I will pass, however if Ian Somerhalder is in, I will see just because of him. :)<br /><br />I think I will stick with Linda Howard, Nora Roberts or Susan Mallery.
B008MEM24S|5.0|They have repurposed Swampy's world of showers to Perry's never-ending exploits in service of good over easy with the OWCA.<br /><br />So far, I've not been disappointed with the game.<br /><br />Nicely done.
B00701L5XS|1.0|it wont download and install properly. At the top of my kindle fire it says: Kelsea's Kindle (1) and I look at the download and it keeps saying download: 2% and wont change. I cant get it to go away! help!! it is also loaded with spyware and adware... so much for a free app of the day!
B00628RVV0|5.0|This film showed the holocaust from an officer's family's perspective; I found it very moving.  The tragedy of teaching our children to hate and the resultant repercussions are highlighted.  I will never forget the mournful outcry of the mother when she realized her son's fate.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|First off, I saw Battle Royale years ago and loved it. Yes, there are some similarities between BR and The Hunger Games. So what? For me, it doesn't make the book any less amazing. Aside from kids being forced to hunt one another, there's little in common. The Hunger Games is a much deeper story.<br /><br />I actually had no intention of ever reading these, being that I'm much more into horror novels, until my daughter wanted to and I decided it would be fun to spend the summer reading the series with her- a mini mother/daughter book club, if you will. I never dreamed I'd become so enthralled within the first 20 pages. Deep characters, a sad and somewhat grim atmosphere, a beautiful love story, and an epic world. I can't say enough great things about this book!
B007KZY1YY|3.0|Well, surprisingly the plot has improved somewhat in this second book of the trilogy.  I do however question how often a person can have sex in a day, week and so forth without some possible medical problems but hey, we all want the lover who simply can't get enough.<br />When exactly is there time for real life, and exciting sex venues work well for me but repeating phrases often quite ruins the moment. She should be flushing her system with water instead of just flushing with embarrassment.  In fact I worry that Ana may not be drinking enough water as I would hate for cystitus to set in, oh wait a minute does it qualify as pain?<br />Marriage and Vanilla Sex is a great concept but we all know the Red Room will make an appearance sooner or later but can we have some heavy duty editing first?  Again I am weak and will read the next one, I want to know where it will end and if the author finally finds some new vocabulary.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I think this app is cool and cute I'm 11 and I love it I play with this thing every day I don't get any bugs or anything its so cute! LOVE THIS APP!!!!!!!!!!!
B007L3BMGA|3.0|Having heard so much about this I expected \\"so much\\".  My mistake?  I can not say I did not enjoy it or even that it is a terrible book but I have to ask why all the fuss when there are so many better books around?  I agree the characters and situation are interesting, and the darker side of sex certainly has a fascination but there is no connection to our protagonists because they are childish and under-developed. This is not their fault.  I can also understand that Christian's dark side comes from his past but something has me witholding sympathy.  Quite simply he just doesn't draw me in. Then of course there is Ana.  Well, what can I say? She just doesn't do it for me. She is so 'special' that she elicits such a strong reaction from him? Really?  What does work is the fact that we all know we have a dark side that can come out given a set of circumstances but  hello, we know that anyway.<br />At the end of the day it's a reasonable read and yes I will read the other two.  I have to or I will never be able to find out how often the author can repeat words and phrases.  I also confess to wanting to know where it all ends up.  Hey, I am human and weak and can succumb to questionable literature.
B003OBJNPA|5.0|This is the best concert of the Bee Gees ever! I am glad I purchased this. I am especially glad now that Maurice and Robin are both gone. It is something to remember the way they were. Great music, great vocals and great personalities!
B007KOYEOC|3.0|That Red Room certainly makes for an interesting and I am sure that for some a somewhat vicarious sex life, and fortunately if you don't like something then you can always put a plug in it.  Oh wait, have I got that wrong? Are the plugs meant for another use?<br />This book has sold based on sex and sex and then more sex which is fine but then write it better and for goodness sake don't let it end on such a timid and weak happy ever after note.  I mean it is nice to know they are free of the dangers and that Ana is such a hero but give me a break and use the butt plugs on the ending, it may make room for better use of language and improve the plot.<br /><br />The books are readable.  I enjoyed them and if I am harsh it is because there are such good writers out there that don't get given a break.  We get what we deserve perhaps?  All I really know is I am glad the books have reached a conclusion from a literary point of view, and that despite the weaknesses I was entertained for a short while.
B00701L5XS|5.0|very informative and easy to use. makes me wish I could remember all the knots I used to know. A+ great app

B005LAIHY0|4.0|Ridley Scott, while making many other films during his almost 40-year career, is still most beloved for his work within the Sci-Fi genre with the original ALIEN and the neo-futuristic noir BLADE RUNNER. While I don't share most fans' love for ALIEN (I think it's a triumpth of design and style over substance), I do go gaga over the fascinatingly dark and deeply intelligent BLADE RUNNER. So I'm relatively sure that it will anger some people out there that in my opinion, Ridley Scott's return to the Sci-Fi genre after a 30-year absence in PROMETHEUS is a thematically superior film to ALIEN, but will never be a classic such as ALIEN was destined to become.<br /><br />I will never fault a film or its creators for thinking big, and that's definitely what's going on here. Written by master mindbender Damon Lindelof (the love him/hate him co-creator of LOST) and Jon Spaihts (writer of the high-concept flop THE DARKEST HOUR), we start with a bizarre, mood-setting prologue presumably millions of years ago, and then jump to the year 2089 where we have Doctors Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace of the original Swedish MILLENNIUM trilogy) and Charlie Holloway (Logan Marshall-Green, who looks like a stringier Tom Hardy and that character name HAS to be a easter-egg reference to LOST) discovering on Earth a pictographic pattern amongst great civilzations of the past separated by centuries and great distance. They believe it to be a star map and present this to the old, dying trillionaire Peter Weyland (Guy Pearce in convincing old-man makeup) and thus begins the adventure of discovering the origins of Earth's species in a two-year space flight in the massive ship dubbed \\"Prometheus\\" named for the Greek mythological figure who stole fire from the gods and gave it to humans. Upon arrival at their destination they pulled from this star map which is a moon for the planet LV-223, all of the crew members are awoken from their cryogenic sleep by David (Michael Fassbender), the resident synthetic (or \\"artifical person\\", if you will). The crew, led by company woman Meredith Vickers (Charlize Theron) and the ship's captain Janek (Idris Elba), set down on a moon in this far-flung galaxy. Once there, they start exploring a pyramid-like structure and, in true sci-fi horror fashion, the greatest discovery in scientific history may very well mark the end of our history.<br /><br />The film has a number of problems once things really get underway. My first problems are matters of pet peeves rather than distinct criticisms: I do NOT like it when futuristic films put a specific year on them; just say \\"The Future\\", or put it so far in the future that this technology may seem charming and antiquated. Also, as in the STAR WARS prequels, it's not a terribly good idea to have technology be more advanced than what we see in the stories that are supposed to come AFTER this. Now comes my real criticisms: Certain members of the crew are such obvious \\"red shirts\\" that you know they will meet their fate before too long, however that works both ways as a major character meets their fate somewhat early on in the film which does up the ante for all of the crew. Some of the dialogue is clunky, and some character motivations are murky or just plain indecipherable. Noomi Rapace as Dr. Shaw is obviously meant to fit into the Ellen Ripley mold, which is especially apparent during the film's most visceral and suspenseful scene which involves a horrifying self-surgery, but she somehow doesn't quite fit. She's alternately too demure and then too aggressive. There is also a significant reveal that comes near the beginning of the third act that should have more impact than it does, but it just feels inorganic. Also the character of Vickers as being the \\"company woman\\" for Weyland Industries is designed for you to hate almost immediately; she's far too cold and self-serving. She plays the role very well, but when her character is given a spin that could make her more sympathetic, it doesn't go that way. Even Carter Burke had moments of genuine likability. The character of Janek, as played by Elba, is less of a character and more of a cliche, and it's a sad waste of such a talented actor (He's Stringer Bell, for god's sakes!). And Scott doesn't really have too many edge-of-your-seat moments that a film like this would need particularly in the film's climactic 'battle' which is more of a footnote rather than epic confrontation. Another big problem is that this has essentially already been designed as a franchise rather than a self-contained story. That may be a studio decision (knowing Fox, it probably was), but it still hurts the film more than helps it. And there is a death of another major character in this film that is done so ridiculously that it actually made me kind of angry.<br /><br />However, when the film does work, it REALLY works well. The scenes of initial discovery are incredibly absorbing and the production design work by Arthur Max (designer of every Ridley Scott film since G.I. JANE as well as David Fincher's SE7EN) is stunning to behold. The cinematography of Dariusz Wolski (DP of all of the PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN films, but my favorite work of his is Alex Proyas' underrated masterpiece DARK CITY) is crisp and moody, and the team at Weta Digital who did the effects work did some eye-popping work as well. The philosophical/theological themes and ideas are handled in an intelligent and thought-provoking fashion, and when the suspense is really unleashed, it's far more effective than the large-scale set pieces. The show is essentially stolen right out from everyone else by the brilliant work by Fassbender (who I believe to be one of the hardest working men in the business right now), who is charming and eerie in his childlike fascination, and seems so eager to please, despite his true motives. His moments, even when he's done something truly terrible, are still done with such a benevolence that you know that everything terrible he's doing is not his responsibility, and he does play to a certain regret as he seems to grow throughout the film. Marc Streitenfeld's (also all of Scott's films since AMERICAN GANGSTER) score is somewhat restrained, and that's unusual in a film like this, until the suspense racks up and we're flooded in sound and fury.<br /><br />While this doesn't directly link to the ALIEN franchise, it obviously went out of its way to make sure it was in the same universe, with the whole expedition being financed and overseen by Weyland Industries (which would later become Weyland-Yutani, the company that sent out The Nostromo), and finding these strange and aggressive species on LV-223. As I stated before, this film doesn't present a self-contained story lending itself very obviously to a sequel or entire new franchise for Fox to explore (and eventually exploit, because after all... it's Fox) and so, all the questions that are posed in this film are left relatively unexplored and whether or not we'll see more classical versions of face-huggers, chest-bursters or xenomorphs in future films is up in the air. There is something to work with there both on a thematic and visceral scale, but like the previous ALIEN franchise, it's unlikely that we'll see Ridley Scott returning.<br /><br />I certainly didn't love this film, because when it is good, it's really very good, and when it's bad, it's more innocuous rather than totally debilitating. But unless Fox decides to cede more (or less, depending upon whatever made the film less than stellar) control to the creative team of this film, I'm sure that any further adventures of the remaining crew members of PROMETHEUS might be similarly hamstrung.<br /><br />3.5/5 Starst go that way.

B0006A9FKA|5.0|When the zombie apocalypse arrives, a hero will rise... from his sofa. When a horror maven as exalted as George Romero goes gaga over this film, even the most die-hard skeptic must recognize SHAUN OF THE DEAD for the wildly entertaining jolt of British cinema that it is. SHAUN OF THE DEAD isn't really a trend-setter. It may have opened the door for ZOMBIELAND, but there already were spoofy zombie flicks floating around before SHAUN OF THE DEAD (BRAINDEAD or the EVIL DEAD films, anyone?). SHAUN OF THE DEAD was brilliant and refreshing enough that it massively raised the profiles of several of the participants, namely Simon Pegg and Nick Frost and their constant director Edgar Wright. This tea-swilling triumvirate rarely, if ever, disappoints.<br /><br />At its heart SHAUN OF THE DEAD is a romantic comedy. The narrative revolves around a fidgety love story between slacker Shaun (Pegg) and his fed-up girlfriend Liz (Kate Ashfield). Except it's a love story that frequently gets undercut not only by the walking dead but also by Shaun's unflagging bromance with his even bigger loser and lived-in best friend Ed (Frost). Shaun, a sad sack sales advisor at some department store, has habitually let everyone down (except, I guess, Ed). He neglects his mum. He persistently breaks promises made to his girlfriend. You cannot blame her for dumping him. Which then leads us to Shaun's short term to-do list: go visit mum (bring flowers); win back Liz; sort out life; bash in ravening undead (don't forget flowers for mum).<br /><br />It's a smart, gleeful, and absolutely inspired send-up of zombie horror, and at the end of the day I was surprised by how much heart it had. I think highly enough of SHAUN OF THE DEAD that, off the top of my head, I'm coming up with only four other zombie films to rank above it: Romero's original NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD and DAWN OF THE DEAD and Raimi's EVIL DEAD 2 and ARMY OF DARKNESS. Director Edgar Wright masterfully marries the gory, ghoulish scares with the clever and genuinely funny bits. This is one of those times in which the kinetic quick edits amplify the tension. There are frequent legitimately spooky moments that'll make you jump. Still, it's the goofy sequences that plant themselves in your memory, whether it's the record-hurling sequence or the survivors' pretend zombie walk or any of those moments early on in which Shaun is just oblivious of all those ominous signs that indicate an impending zombie uprising. There are heaps of amusing foreshadowing. SHAUN OF THE DEAD is simply so well made, so well structured and terrifically paced. Pegg and Frost are perfection, with Pegg readily building on his lead actor creds. There is surprising weight and credibility to Simon Pegg. It's a star-making role. And what of their constant director Edgar Wright? Well, I am now hugely anticipating the ANT-MAN movie. That's how much stock I place in that reedy-voiced guy.<br /><br />The DVD's hefty bonus bits:<br /><br />- 2 Audio Commentaries, one with Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright, the other with Pegg, Frost, Kate Ashfield, Dylan Moran (\\"David\\"), and Lucy Davis (\\"Dianne\\")<br />- Simon Pegg's Video Diary (00:06:45 minutes long)<br />- Casting Tapes with Pegg and Frost, Peter Serafinowicz (\\"Pete\\"), Kate Ashfield, Dylan Moran, Lucy Davis (totaling 00:04:11 minutes)<br />- Edgar and Simon's Flip Chart - Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg give an overview of the movie plot via flip chart (00:13:37 minutes)<br />- Zombie Make-up Tests (00:02:21)<br />- Special Effects Comparison: composite shots of the zombie girl impaled on a pole and Pete's bullet thru the eye (00:02:24)<br />- Behind-the-Scenes Press Kit Featurette (00:07:10)<br />- \\"Funky Pete\\" - Quote: \\"Contractually, the makers have to provide a 'clean' version of the film for usage on some airlines and TV stations.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|Fifty Shades was a great book. It does have some cuss words and very detailed sexual situations, but for adults I think it is a great read. I was done with this one in 2 days and bought the next 2 books right away. Also a great trilogy.
B005LAII0I|1.0|Avoid this movie.  It is another biased hollywood attempt to rob the magic out of a beautiful children's classic story.  The innocence is gone, and the undertone's of violence toward men is grotesque.
B005LAIGPA|4.0|First I would like to thank the other critics for finally giving me a way to refer to this type of movie, which I usually detest. Now, the movie- it was Really well done, and most of the time the way it was done didn't keep hitting you in the face.<br /><br />A lot of the critics talk about the power corrupting the 3 teens.  I don't agree.  The power just gave them more ways to bring out what they had inside already.<br /><br />Andrew was in an abusive situation, so he was feeling hurt, helpless, angry, and no way to strike back.  The power gave him a way to do that.  Unfortunately, it takes a LONG time for that emotional trauma to heal, and the power was fueling his anger.<br /><br />Matt, although he seemed popular and outgoing, we start to see that he has a more introspective nature.  When he sees harm to others, he backs away from causing any of it.  And at the end, you can see how much he loves his cousin and tries to help him, but ultimately he acts to save the \\"world\\".<br /><br />Steve I don't feel was affected too much.  He seemed a light-hearted kind of guy, up to pranks and fooling around with stuff, but not intending any harm.  The thing with the car in the parking lot was funny.
034580404X|5.0|The Fifty Shades Trilogy was the best purchase.. I could not stop reading and hope she is writing more. Great reading at a great price.
B007XNAOS0|4.0|I am no good at writing well thought out, eloquent reviews so I'll just give my quick opinion.  This album is a fantastic listen.  It took a couple listens through to really digest.  I threw it on last night and took my dog on an album-long walk in the dark and got lost in it.  It is less \\"heavy\\" than the last couple albums - as in less sludgey rock stuff, but the music is just as, if not more heavy and deep.  The music puts me in a dreamlike state.  I really recommend listening to it while going for a walk at night - great experience.  The production is also top notch with lots of ear candy and solid sounding instruments.  Vocal melodies are interesting and haunting at times.  I like the track organization as well - disc 1 and 2 have their own styles I would say.  Also, purchase the CD and/or vinyl as it is worth it for the fantastic artwork and quality liner notes and lyrics + a cool slipcover that I didn't know would be with it.  Music this good should not be purchased in cheap MP3 form.
B00540G3G6|5.0|This is a holiday classic that is fun for the whole family. The 2d blu ray is perhaps better than the 3d version but it is included with this package so you can see it that way too.  The 3d version is blown up to a different ratio than the 2d version. Does this crop the picture? I don't know. But this is a dark movie and was not shot in 3d. It was re-released in 3d though. So you get that version here. The 3d is more for depth in this one than anything else. However I thought the picture looked as good as the 2d version. If you can afford this package then get it. It has lots of extras on the 2d disc. However like alot of movies converted to 3d it's not spectacular , it's still a good watch though and worth the upgrade if affordable to you.  This is one of tim burtons best for sure. It includes several short features like 'frankenweenie' (which is now been made into a full fledged movie) and others.  I have 58 3d blu rays and this is as good as most of them.

1451627289|5.0|Did you ever wish you had the power to change history?<br /><br />In Stephen King's tour de force \\"11/22/63,\\" history is changed and those changes unleash streams of action that effects many other events.<br /><br />Jake Epping is a high school teacher in Lisbon Falls, Maine. He earns extra money teaching GED so students can return to school and earn an accredited high school diploma. Jake is particularly moved by the paper of Harry Dunning. Harry is the school janitor, a man who walks with a limp and has less than full mental ability. His paper is about \\"...a day that chanced my live.\\" In the paper, Harry details how his father murdered his mother and two brothers, hit him on the head with a hammer-causing brain damage, and sending his sister into a coma.<br /><br />Jake gives the paper an A and goes on to other things. Then, Jake's friend, Al Templeton, asks him to come to his diner. In the back, the pantry opens up into history.<br /><br />Al and Jake discuss the beneficial things that could happen if some things in history could be changed. They decide that the most momentous change would be if they could disrupt JFK's assassination.<br /><br />To test the theory, Jake wants to go back in time, to Derry, Maine, to change Harry Dunning's history.<br /><br />This book is a joy. Stephen King is a master of setting the scene for the reader to feel part of the action and when we read about the old songs that were playing on the radio, and see the cost of items in 1958, we feel we are truly back when Harry's father went berserk.<br /><br />Jake takes on a new name and identification and makes himself part of the community. He gives people the idea he's looking for real estate opportunities. An interesting side for King fans is that the town, Derry, talks about missing children and in King's book \\"It,\\" these events occurred.<br /><br />This part of the story ends and Jake returns to Dallas and the period before JFK's assassination. Jake gets a job in a high school, directs a school play, wins friends and makes a lasting effect on students' lives-all the while when he's planning on how to stop Oswald from assassinating JFK.<br /><br />Along with King's classic, \\"The Stand,\\" this may be his best and most memorable book. Jake is a well developed character. He's a well liked teacher that we all remember as being the best we had.<br /><br />Stephen King has also earned that place, among the very best we have. Don't miss this book. It will become a classic.ects a school play, wins friends and makes a lasting effect on students' lives-all the while when he's planning on how to stop Oswald from assassinating JFK.<br /><br />Along with King's classic, \\"The Stand,\\" this may be his best and most memorable book.

My previous review harped on the inclusion of spyware in the app. The developer states that the code was never used or active, and to be doubly sure, the offending code has now been removed completely. I was waiting for an app like this to come around, and this one works great!

1466401885|2.0|I agree with one of the other reviews, I can totally see why this book would appeal to the Twilight generation.<br /><br />- There is no specific description of the characters making it possible for any girl to put herself in Abby's shoes having a lovestruck guy act like the alpha male of the pack and go berserk if another guy as much as looks in her direction.<br /><br />- I got tired of lack of plot, the entire thing went around Abby and Travis' realtionship where random events were thrown in and out to make way for fight, break-up, make- up.....<br /><br />- Under what circumstances is it ok for a girl to be going out with one boy accepting diamonds and the going to sleep with another even if it was for a bet? She was actually surprised that people were spreading gossip!! Seriouly!!<br /><br />-Too many typos! I wonder if the editor took his time reading this??<br /><br />All that's missing is a couple of sparkly vampires and we'd have another \\"Disaster\\" on our hands.

1451608659|5.0|Autobiographies are my favorite kinds of books to read, and I have read many.  Lately, there have been a lot of poorly written ones, but this one shines!  Dominique's story is unique. Not even Danielle Steele or Sydney Sheldon could come up with a more amazing story line! Yet this one's all true!<br /><br />First off:  the book cover.  This photo of a young Dominique and the way it is positioned on the cover in mostly black and white is simply stunning. I don't think I've ever mentioned a book cover in all my reviews, but something about the look on her face...you can't take your eyes off her.<br /><br />Now inside the book:  although Dominique has much to tell she does a fine job going into depth about different life situations while holding the reader's interest. The book moves you across the years of her life very nicely.  Usually I am not too interested in the history of the autobiographer's parents and suffer through it.  Yet, the backstories of both of Dominique's parents were fascinating!  Also, good for her, for blowing the whistle at the Karolyis and their sadistic ways of training young Olympians.<br /><br />I would have liked to hear more about how Dominique's mother, Camelia, was able to conceal her second pregnancy from her daughter and more about the mother and second daughter's relationship since they've been reunited.  Maybe Camelia will write a book of her own one day.  Also, one small correction, Dominique mentions her husband graduated from Ohio State University, and it should have correctly been referred to as \\"The Ohio State University\\". These are small issues; I really loved the book, and Dominique is an amazing woman!

B006YG9HJE|5.0|I'll just write it out right now: I think that Nikita is one of the best television shows on air right now.<br /><br />People might laugh because, hey, it's on the CW and while CW shows are a guilty pleasure, they're not actually GOOD, right? But the thing is, Nikita isn't a typical CW show at all. In fact, it sticks out like a sore thumb on the network because it really doesn't fit with any of the other programs. Anyway...<br /><br />When season two starts, a lot of things have changed. Amanda is in charge of Division and has locked Percy up. Nikita and Michael are on the run. Alex is trying to avenge her father's death. And Birkhoff is, well, NOT working with Nikita and Michael. ;)<br /><br />Nikita's second season ends up being vastly different from the first. For one thing, Nikita and Michael are no longer \\"frenemies\\", which lends a very different vibe to their scenes together. I've heard some people complain that these two are boring now that they're actually in a relationship, but I disagree. I like that the writers don't feel the need to throw in manufactured drama and angst into their relationship. And we knew that they were going to get together eventually, so I'm thrilled that the writers decided to not drag out their will-they-won't-they dance for an additional four or five seasons.<br /><br />The biggest change is that Alex and Nikita start off this season no longer working together. As someone who really enjoyed the friendship between these two, I was pretty heartbroken when Alex and Nikita had a falling out at the end of season 1. Their relationship has become a lot more fractured and complicated in season 2, and the writers do a good job at depicting this. We see that Nikita feels like she has failed Alex and will do anything to protect her even though they're no longer on the same side. We see that Alex resents Nikita for what she's done and said (or not said), but that ultimately Alex still cares about her, too. The scenes between these two as theyslowly rebuild their trust and friendship are fantastic. When they finally reunite and reconcile, it is hands down one of the best scenes in the series.<br /><br />Both Alex and Nikita are strong female characters whose lives don't revolve around men, which is another thing that makes this show so great. At the same time, \\"strong\\" is not the same as flawless. Nikita and Alex have their share of flaws, which make them more believable and relatable as characters. For example, Nikita has trouble treating people as equals, which both Alex and Michael rightfully call her out on. Alex, meanwhile, is stubborn and naive, which ends up being a dangerous combination as we see her getting in way over her head with Percy and Amanda.<br /><br />The casting for this show is pitch-perfect. Maggie Q especially comes into her own during this season. She was a bit wooden at times in season 1, but now she delves deep into Nikita's emotional core. Her acting in Wrath was some of the finest I've seen. And on the action side, I'm impressed that someone like Lyndsy Fonseca, who I assume doesn't have any stuntwork or fighting experience, comes across as a very believable Miss Badass. (It should go without saying that Maggie Q is badass herself.) We also see the introduction of some new characters like military man Sean (Dillon Casey), who ends up being a foil for Alex, as well as the return of some old favorites like the rebellious Owen (Devon Sawa) and by-the-book Ryan (Noah Bean).<br /><br />One potential drawback of this show is how heavily serialized it is. I don't mind serialization, but it could be confusing to newcomers. Season 2 in particular becomes MUCH more heavily serialized than season 1 was. During the latter half of season 2, there were times that even I was confused as to what was going on, even though I'm a loyal viewer. It's sometimes a headache trying to keep track of all the shifting alliances and backstabbing going on! But hey, on the other hand, it's pretty nice having a show that makes you think to that extent. There are a few plotholes because I don't think the writers planned everything out in advance, but nothing so big that you can't just handwave them away. :)<br /><br />All in all, Nikita is an excellent series and more people should give it a chance! Don't let its CW pedigree scare you away.<br /><br />A solid 4.5 stars (rounded up to 5 due to Amazon's ratings system).
B000W91RUG|5.0|*knock*PENNY*knock*PENNY*knock*PENNY...Finally,a series that is smart AND funny! Literally!!  For me,there has not been a  series that is set in the real world featuring a veritable nerd since Macgyver...EEEE! We are introduced to Dr. Leonard Hofstaeder,and Dr. Sheldon Cooper, both physicists at Cal Tech Pasadena, two brilliant scientists who are socially awkward (Sheldon is completely inept!!), nerds who feel more comfortable in a parallel universe dominated by Klingons and stormtroopers (and superheroes),rather than their contemporaries! And their fellow nerdmigoes Howard Wolowitz and Rajesh Koothropaali round out the click. Little do they know that their world is going to be turned upside-down when Penny, a beautiful waitress/ actress moves in next door and introduces them to a completely new M-Class planetoid...social interaction!!  The 1st season introduces us to the character idiosyncrasies, and their awkwardness around each other is apparent from EP 1. Leonard is smitten with Penny, Wolowitz is trying to get down her pants, Raj cannot make eye contact(he has selective mutism), and Sheldon cannot accept the fact that she is not as smart as them. And the laughs are free-flowing!  The brilliant mathematical and scientific references are specifically written to be understood by those who can comprehend them. My personal favorite is the season finale, \\"The tangerine factor\\",in which Sheldon is learning Mandarin,because he suspects that the chicken he is being served is not tangerine, but in fact orange. Howard is teaching him, but leaves off when Penny mentions that her ex-boyfriend is writing about their sex life in a blog (which he cannot find)....and Leonard finally asks Penny out!

B004UID2LC|5.0|This app is awesome! You Don't need wifi for videos that you download! I don't know why it's free. It should be at least 0.99!
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Two friends recommended this book when I said I needed a \\"beach read,\\" and I am forever grateful to those friends for introducing me to this wonderful book.  Enzo is an old soul of a dog who is so humanlike in his mannerisms and qualities.  The story is so well-written that I recognized behavior of my own dogs that I've had throughout my life and thought about how similar it sounded, and how much I always wondered what my dog thought at the time.  Stein puts it into words so well, it's truly impressive.  I read this book so quickly, it didn't last the entire week at the beach! I'll also mention it had me in tears!  I highly recommend this book to anyone, dog lover or not, because Enzo has some great perspective on the world in which we live.
B004I1KGTW|1.0|I can't seem to get through this book.  It's so wordy ( I know - books are full of words, but this one doesn't say anything!) and the characters are so uninteresting.  I never did finish it.  Just didn't care what happened next.
B0077SGMXM|4.0|Very enjoyable game, have supported the developer on other games as I got this one for free.  Well worth paying for, though like all geometry games, it can get tedious at times.  Especially as you progress through the game.<br /><br />I keep this on my phone, it is a great game to go back to time and again.  Plenty of levels, plenty of advanced challenges.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Sigh.  I read about 5 books a week and have for the last 40 some years.  This is one of the worst books I have ever read in my life.  The ONLY reason I finished it is because I almost always finish reading books that I start.  This book is poorly written, poorly plotted, poorly edited (don't even get me started) and poorly planned.  Come on, there are those of us who have heard of subs, doms and butt plugs.  And for us, this was extremely disappointing.  I have been fascinated by the issue of power control between men and women for decades, and this book is like a BDSM teaser for 20 year olds.  I was given this book by a friend (who I'm now too embarrassed to talk to to tell her how much I hated this book).  Before I read the stupid thing, my daughter told me she had heard good things about it from her friends.  AFTER I read it, I hid it so that my daughter couldn't read it.  If one is interested in power play between the sexes, this book is the WRONG introduction.
B006RUJST6|5.0|This book was captivating from the beginning..such a sweet, heart-warming story about family, life and love. I purchased Point of Retreat the second I finished this one.

B004FN16DS|2.0|I'll preface by saying that the author is NOT a free market economist. I am not an economist but I hold socially liberal and fiscally conservative views (yes, this means that both Democrats and Republicans hate me). I bought this book because I find it interesting to read stuff I disagree with and I found plenty here, which is fine.<br /><br />What was not fine were the very cheap shots. Example: \\"Can you honestly tell the difference between 2% inflation and 4% inflation?\\" Well - after 10 years of this stuff, 2% inflation means that your savings eroded about 22%. 4% annual inflation means that your savings eroded 48%. Can you tell the difference?<br /><br />The author is right in his opening premise that there is no such thing as a completely free market - all modern markets are regulated. Where he completely fails is in addressing the complex issues of degrees of regulation and the differences between \\"good\\" regulation (e.g., the kind that promotes transparency and broad participation) vs. \\"bad\\" regulation (e.g., the kind that protects entrenched participants from new competition).<br /><br />The right is plenty guilty of demagoguery. The answer to that is not demagoguery from the left but rather, an intelligent discussion from both sides. Unfortunately, this is not something this books provides.

B000002KDS|5.0|One of the greatest Hard rock albums EVER-bar none. The Alice Cooper Bands crowning achievement-better than 'Love It To Death' or even 'Schools Out' IMHO. The album is heavy, catchy, dark, and even orchestral in some spots. A hard ROCK orchestra that is.'Halo Of Flies', 'Dead Babies', and 'Killer' are worth the price of admission alone. Check out Glen Buxton's 'fly' effects on his guitar in the intro of 'Halo'--INSANE! The late great Mr.Buxton (R.I.P.) is one of Rock History's most underrated players who deserves many accolades for influencing scores of today's guitarists. This was the band in their defining moment-'Killer' was Alice 'finding himself'-truly developing the morbid character he is now famous for. The band is absolutely on fire with buzz saw guitar sounds, bombastic bass playing, and thunderous drumming. Cooper himself has a deadly sneer in his voice in every song-and masterfully mellows it down in 'Desperado' only to bite your face off once again during the chorus..fabulous! Cooper was doing the makeup thing even before KISS, and this listener suspects Gene Simmons was a big admirer! This was the very first Alice Cooper Band album I'd ever heard (the title I choose to use because it wasn't just 'ALICE COOPER' to me until Welcome To My Nightmare), and it is a huge reason I've been a musician for the past 26 years. If your new to Alice Cooper-or have never heard any of his earlier (and better) works-'Killer' is a MUST HAVE.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This game is so awesome because you are like so tense to see if your going to win or not. So its very addictive. And its the perfect game to play if your alone or your very bored. Plus if you want to your allowed to pick if you want a random draw or a winning draw. If you mess up you can tap on the lower screen and it will say undo so you can fix your mistake. You also can start over again whenever you want. So you guys should really try this because it may look boring but its not!
1926778103|1.0|For Real!?!?!?!?!?!? $279.00 for this book?? I thought that this book was ripping at the bindings and why is it so expensive now? There must have been a shortage in printing.
B005HSL626|5.0|This is a great app. But sometimes when your slicing the fruit it starts to burn your finger because your kindle fire starts to get hot. But the game itself is very fun so you should still get this game. The arcade mode is the best part in the game because you have to get a certain amount of slices before the time runs out. And its very addicting. So you should really get this game because its fun and addictive.
B005GHN2GG|5.0|Awesome, brilliant hooked by the first few pages couldnt put it down.<br />Wish there was a follow up of more stories.

0691152640|4.0|This book is destined to be a classic.  And it will be talked about for decades, if only because so many people have read it, or at least have it on their shelves.<br /><br />This Time is Different is frighteningly ambitious, and it mostly does a good job synthesizing 800 years of economic data.<br /><br />I feel that the book my be overly classical in its approach.  It lumps in data from the modern, post-Bretton Woods era (1971-) with pre-Bretton Woods data, implicitly suggesting that nothing fundamental changed between these two eras.  My belief is that the post-Bretton Woods era is a starkly different era:  when major countries can print in unlimited quantity and successfully issue debt in their own currency, the old rules really don't apply.  Rogoff and Reinhart rely on classical arguments which suggest that nothing too fundamental changed during the post Bretton Woods era; money creation by central authorities has always been present, they suggest, and a change in the potential degree of money creation doesn't really alter the economics fundamentally.  Money creation by central authorities was going on in medieval times and before.<br />I can't help but feel, however, that if you're writing a book on the macroeconomic implications of debt and money creation, you have to be leading readers astray by lumping all your data together and treating all different types of regimes as essentially similar.  A more nuanced view would show that the macroeconomic implications of debt differ substantially depending on the type of economy and the time period (pre-1971 economies that issue debt in foreign currency look different than pre-1971 economies that issue debt in home currency, and both look far different than post-1971 economies that issue debt in home currency).
B008MEM24S|5.0|To quote DUF: LOVE IT!!!<br />'Where's my water' but with everyone's favorite platypus! The sound bites are hilarious. This should be a top buy for any P&F fan!
B00846TTDG|5.0|This is a great movie with wonderful action scenes.  The fact that the actual soldiers are actors makes it even better.  There are things in this movie that you won't see anywhere else, simply because of the realism that the actual soldiers bring to the scenes.<br /><br />This is a must see for anyone looking for a action/war/soldier movie.  You won't be disappointed.<br /><br />Makes me feel good about our armed forces!
0345803485|1.0|Just like everyone else, I was really excited to read this book from all the praise & hype it was receiving. I ordered the book online & when I got it delivered to my home I immediately began to read it. Problem was that within the first two chapters I was already bored.<br /><br />Like many other reviews have stated: the characters are undeveloped, the writing is juvenile & repetitive, & the erotica isn't even slightly erotic. I've read Cosmopolitan Magazines that have gotten me more stimulated than this!<br /><br />I understand that the author was \\"inspired\\" by the 'Twilight' books but that's another factor why the book is unreadable. The characters in 'Fifty Shades' are a mirror of Stephenie Meyer's characters in 'Twilight', without the supernatural factor of course & with sex added into the mix, which makes this book unoriginal, uncreative, & altogether quite boring.<br /><br />For reserved people who even the words \\"cock\\" or \\"vagina\\" make you uncomfortable, then this might be a good read for you. But for me, reading an ADULT fiction, I was expecting a bit more.<br /><br />At the end of the day, I want my money back & won't be reading the remaining books in the series. Do yourself a favor, ignore the praise & hype, & skip this book.
B008K9UZY4|5.0|love it! its exactly how I remember it being on my old Sega CD system, now with the convenience of being portable. The controls are just fine if youask me, just like the genesis controller, if you've played a touchscreen sidescroller it wont take long to feel natural. For those not familiar with the original on Sega CD, it's. only slightly more challenging (in some ways) than Sonic 1, 2, 3, and Knuckles. seeing how well this runs on my Kindle Fire, itmakes me want to try out Sonic 4, not to mention wish the original previous games were available. Well worth the buy for a Sonic fan.

B007L3BMGA|4.0|When I started Fifty Shades of Grey I had no idea what I was getting myself into, meaning I literally hadn't heard what this book was about...<br />The story line is, for me, a bit unbelievable. However, if you are looking for a thrill, or a way to spice up your sex life, this is your book!!! It is amazing what the written word can do for your libido that really, nothing else can. Luckily while reading the first book my boyfriend and I were on holiday;)<br />I'm sure any woman could appreciate what this author has created.

Supposedly there's hours and hours and hours of extra footage. Enough for numerous movies. Some of it is included and it makes the experience that much more exciting. At the same time it makes you thirst for more

B0088RQ4X4|1.0|This movie is bad, really bad.  It is absolutely NOT worth the rental price.  If you value good stories that make sense, don't waste your time with this one.  It seems like the writers threw together a bunch of somewhat decent plot ideas, but didn't spend the time developing a clear and coherent story.<br /><br />I can't believe I'm even spending this much time writing this review for this stupid movie...but I guess I am just trying to save you $5.<br /><br />Yeah, this was a bad film.

B00001OH7V|5.0|\\"Heroes\\" is David Bowie's best album, hands down. This is a brilliant record from start to finish. It's the middle installment of what has become known as the \\"Berlin Trilogy,\\" three albums Bowie made while living in that city; the albums are \\"Low,\\" \\"Heroes\\" and \\"Lodger.\\"<br /><br />In my opinion, Bowie achieved the perfect balance on this record between conventional pop/rock structure and more of an \\"art rock\\" aesthetic. \\"Low,\\" on the other hand, veered somewhat too much toward the arty, while \\"Lodger\\" definitely stepped more toward the pop side.<br /><br />Side One of \\"Heroes\\" (sorry, I was brought up in the vinyl era) is superb, and more pop/rock than Side Two. That's not to say it isn't interesting and innovative. \\"Beauty and the Beast,\\" \\"Joe the Lion,\\" \\"Heroes\\" and \\"Blackout\\" are all just KILLER rock songs, and the fourth song, \\"Sons of the Silent Age,\\" is gentler but just as stunning, putting Bowie's impressive vocal range to excellent use.<br /><br />These songs' instrumentation consists of the usual rock stuff -- guitars, bass, keyboards, drums. But when Robert Fripp is your lead guitarist ... well, you're just not going to sound \\"normal\\" with the King Crimson founder playing on your stuff. Fripp is especially brilliant on the title track; \\"Heroes\\" just soars and screams, and the mood -- of some kind of ecstatic triumph merging with something sadder, darker -- is just insanely addictive. I have, at times, played this song half a dozen times in a row.<br /><br />Side Two is a completely different animal, all art-rock edges and strange, otherworldly corners. There's a definite Eastern influence that does not overwhelm the music. \\"V-2 Schneider\\" is the most driving song here, and it's followed by three pieces of music that can only be described as aural meditations -- \\"Sense of Doubt,\\" \\"Moss Garden\\" and \\"Neukoln.\\" Each piece flows into the next. \\"Sense of Doubt,\\" despite being quiet, does sound rather menacing, while \\"Moss Garden\\" is much more reflective; by the time \\"Neukoln\\" begins, we've moved out of rock 'n' roll completely, and into a realm of music that becomes, ultimately, undefinable.<br /><br />Bowie ends the side and the album with the strangely satisfying \\"The Secret Life of Arabia.\\" It's more concrete than the pieces that have preceded it, but every bit as moving and mysterious.<br /><br />I absolutely love this album. I don't ever get tired of it, not even after having listened to it for a quarter century. This is amazing music; don't miss it.e time \\"Neukoln\\" begins, we've moved out of rock 'n' roll completely, and into a realm of music that becomes, ultimately, undefinable.<br /><br />Bowie ends the side and the album with the strangely satisfying \\"The Secret Life of Arabia.\\" It's more concrete than the pieces that have preceded it, but every bit as moving and mysterious.<br /><br />I absolutely love this album.

0441013074|4.0|Alastair Reynolds is one of my absolute favorite authors and giving him four our of five starts feels like a total letdown. This was actually only my second encounter with Reynolds a few years ago and contrary to many reviewers it has not prevented me from following up with the rest of his writing. Yes, it is not among his best books but it is still a very entertaining story.<br /><br />The book starts with two seemingly unconnected story lines, a future archaeologist recovering items from a post apocalyptic Paris and a private investigator in a fascist mid-twentieth century Paris. So... there is some sort of murky connection, but it is more fun to discover it yourself than letting the back cover or a review spoil it for you. The physics obviously can't be very convincing, but I don't consider this book a serious try at hard science fiction. Reynolds is playing with settings, stereotypes, cliches, and whole genres. Blending them together and tearing them apart again. The first works better than the latter and especially the last third of the book has some lengths that could have been avoided. Most scenes work best if you just try to get a feel for it rather than looking at all the details. The clues of the crime story are laid out rather clumsily, but the characters move around very believable. The Casablanca references work very well in a rain soaked fascist Paris as does the \\"Third Man\\" underground espionage feeling.<br /><br />Maybe the biggest flaw of the book is that it tries too much. Closely followed by a little more editing that should have been done. Alastair Reynolds is not trying to explain everything, but many things are repeatedly laid out for the characters instead of the reader. The last third of the book seemed to be more of an add on so as not to disappoint the fans of space opera -- this whole part does not convincingly help the plot and could have easily been removed from the story. I wished the blend of genres had been a little lighter, less dead-serious, and more playful but I didn't get as hung up on the details as many other reviewers. It's still a fun book and I enjoyed it for the most part.<br /><br />I recently listened to the audio book read by John Lee who does an amazing job of bringing all the characters to life. I tend to get distracted by other things when listening to audio books, but this one really caught my attention from beginning to end.-serious, and more playful but I didn't get as hung up on the details as many other reviewers.

B0058ZPNOK|1.0|A casino bet that puts all it's chips on this angry stoner randomly squatting in this numb grieving family's house.  The problem is he's miscast, poorly written, poorly acted, poorly directed, unlikeable, and uninteresting.  Somebody's rich influential daddy must have come up with the 7 million bucks to pressure good actors to do this rehash.
B005LAIGF0|5.0|To be clear: all 5 stars go to Kenneth Lonergan's fantastic movie, which leaves 0 stars for Amazon/Fox's oddball choice to release a \\"BLU-RAY/DVD combo\\" that is neither. The product description doesn't make this clear, but what you get in this package is a Blu-Ray disc of the theatrical release, and a plain DVD of the \\"extended\\" version. So if you're a Blu-Ray customer you feel ripped off for only getting half the product, and if you're a DVD customer you can't even *watch* the theatrical release.<br /><br />Misadvertised, poorly thought through, and nicely dissatisfying. Sadly, for the 7 of us who still buy physical-media releases, there appears to be no other option.

B007IXWKUK|1.0|You know how difficult it is to look away when you see a car accident?  It's not good to stare. You can't see much, but yet you continue to look. This book is the same way. Poorly written with a shallow plot and poorly developed characters, the intrigue lies on the graphic but often boring, sexual escapades.
B000MRAAJM|4.0|Planet earth is a wonderful series to watch. Crystal clear on blu ray. Now i said it's fun to watch but the music and narrator can get quite monotonous. I would say this series is more adult oriented because there's a lot of scenes of inaction. Very pretty inaction. Of course the kids will love watching the animals. I give it four stars because there's not much else besides the actual videos. No extra features.

B007L3BMGA|4.0|This book has put a whole new slant on getting what I want out of my man, a must read for every female
0345525558|5.0|For me, one mark of a great book is that once you start reading it, you just can't put it down until you've read the last word. This was one of those books for me. Having read reviews that this was about a foster child , I was hooked on reading it. Yes, this was a great read about a foster child--- difficult situations, system failures, foster families in it for the wrong reasons; and perhaps most importantly---the emotionaly difficult time foster kids often have in trusting love and commitment. But more interesting yet, this was one of those books that I did not feel like I'd read dozens of times before. If foster children are NOT your thing, be assured you'll thoroughly enjoy the writing and story line anyway. The characters were very well developed, and I found myself cheering on for at least eight different people throughout the story. Then again, Victoria and Grant will not leave your heart for a very long time. Anyone reading my reviews will know I'm a champion of survivors! This book creates survivors from some horrible situations in very fascinating and believable ways!!! LOVED EVERY WORD! Looking forward to many more great reads by Vanessa Diffenbaugh!!

B004ZZS4CC|3.0|A factual account of the abduction of an 11-year old girl who was held \\"captive\\" until she was finally freed at age 29. Written from her perspective. The story is riveting, but the writing is lack-luster and there are so many missing details that it left me with more questions than answers. The most disturbing aspect of this story is how the authorities failed so miserably in their duties, which allowed the abuse to continue as long as it did.
030758836X|1.0|I had high hopes for this book given all the praise from both critics and readers alike. Do not believe the hype. I read approximately 25 books a year and this is by far the worst book I've read this year so far. It is the first time I read a Gillian Flynn novel and I honestly think that the woman does not know how to write. It was atrocius! Who uses colons in almost every paragraph??? The characters were incredibly annoying and I did not feel for anyone in the story. The way Amy talks made me want to punch her in the face. I just wanted it to end, and not because I was sitting in anticipation waiting to see what happens, but because the characters annoyed me that much and I wanted to get back to my life. The reason I did not stop in the middle is because I kept up hope that maybe...just maybe, it was going to turn around and get better. Big mistake! This was, hands down, THE WORST ending to any book I have ever read. Utterly ridiculous! Do not waste your time with this book!
B007SGM084|2.0|100% inconsequential drivel! I do not understand all the hype about this series. The only appeal it would have to the \\"Vanilla\\" types (the vast majority of us) is the factual description of the apparatus, tools, and techniques used in the BDSM (Bondage, Discipline, Sado-Masichism) lifestyle. In that respect, it is educational and highly erotic, although it is only the tip of the iceberg. Otherwise, the characters are \\"plastic\\", especially Christian - super good-looking, super-rich,the best lover ever, blah, blah, blah. Why can't they just be regular people? Add to that the whole erroneous premise that people who enjoy that kind of activity and lifestyle must be depraved and suffering from some kind of psychological damage! Sheer nonsense - a lot of people use BDSM simply to spice up their sex life, and what's wrong with that when both partners are consenting adults and use the \\"safe, sane, consentual\\" principles? It is written from the perspective of a 22-year old virgin gorgeous girl (yeah right!) who is not the brightest bulb on the tree, and the narrative goes on and on and on etc. Totally boring.

0307592731|1.0|This book came highly recommended by a writer who called it \\"brave.\\"  What rot.  I can't believe I spent money on this dreck. The death of the author's mother and the author's subsequent grief is, supposedly, responsible for the author's descending into years of promiscuity and drug abuse.  Everyone grieves differently, of course, but the author seems blithely unaware that perhaps her mother's death was not the foundational problem. The horrifyingly brutal murder of her dead mother's neglected horse (which the author herself has allowed to starve) is a cheap purchase on the reader (as these types of scenes usually are--read Richard Wright's \\"Almos' a Man\\" if you want to see how such scenes both honor the animal and teach the reader something about human pain).  If she and her brother had done this to a person, they'd be in prison (in fact, doing this to an animal will put you in jail).  How she got away with it is beyond me.  And her utter lack of remorse is depraved.  To make matters worse, it's not enough that she starved, tortured and killed this horse; she then realized--all these years later--that she could gain further purchase on it for literary shock-value.  So rather than honor the horse and its terrible suffering, she--unbelievably--hacks away at it one more time and uses it as a metaphor for her own psychic pain:  \\"Who cares about the horse?  It's all about ME!\\" (read Linda Hogan's memoir--\\"The Woman Who Watches Over the World\\"--if you want to experience a real writer's exploration of the meaning of suffering, both equine and human).  As for her \\"brave\\" trip:  she doesn't bother to educate herself in preparation (aside from what she needs to shop for), thinks incessantly about herself along the way, virtually ignores the natural world (except insofar as it poses obstacles), and trashes the trail as she goes. She learned nothing.  Zero.  Zip.  From the opening page to the end, I distrusted this author's voice.  There's something not truthful, and even pathological, about her understanding of the world, and her place in it.  Brave?  Give me a break.  She's merely a self-absorbed hack, who figured out how to exploit sex, abuse, animals, and Nature as a great marketing tool to showcase her own . . . whatever.  I'm sure it was cathartic for her.  For me, it was an utter waste of time.  Save your money.
030758836X|5.0|Really enjoyed the clever twists and turns, this novel is intelligent, well-written, and the characters are beautifully sketched out, fascinating and enthralling as a train wreck. Highly recommend!!
B0064NTZQ2|4.0|I'd expected more action in this film, but I wasn't disappointed with what was provided: a portrait of a troubled yet determined young man in dire circumstances, fighting for what he loves.<br /><br />The acting, directing, and cinematography are all first-rate.<br /><br />Beware: there is intense, graphic violence. The violence is not gratuitous, though some (who care more about violence-level than the integrity of a film) some might think it excessive.<br /><br />The one place where this film fails miserably is in song-choice.<br /><br />The incidental music is just fine - I'm talking about the terrible bubble-gum pop 80s-esque tunes used over what would otherwise be considered to be a very serious film.<br /><br />One song, \\"A Real Hero\\" by College, is particularly vapid. It would have seemed more appropriate in a mid-eighties sentimental made-for-TV romance. This non-entity of a song totally distracted me from the movie. I found myself thinking that the movie itself was made in the 80s, and that the producers ran out of money for song licensing.<br /><br />Another tune, \\"Oh My Love\\" by Riz Ortolani, while beautiful on its own, seems incongruous in this film. The song is so passionate, yet the style of the film is noir-cool. It made no sense in this film.<br /><br />A film this good deserves its songs to be chosen more appropriately.

B007XNAOS0|5.0|Not even sure you can call this metal, unless you call it the next phase of what metal can be.<br /><br />So many reasons to praise this album...first, it's a double album. I love that ambition. It also comes with great artwork, a full heavy-duty lyric booklet and cool cover. So many CDs today come in lame paper sleeves with no extra material.<br /><br />The album SOUNDS great. A good mix, with big sounding drums and bass; it doesn't sound overcompressed to me.<br /><br />And then there is the incredible music, an ambitious mix of hard rock, sludge, and psychedelia. The song Eula should be a huge hit. Great album.
B000ASATZ8|5.0|After watching Tremors I kept thinking, how could the next movie get any better. But they do get better. Besides the Fourth movie. I'm not too crazy about the fourth movie. My fav. out of all four Tremor movies is part 2. It was funny and I liked the walking monsters. I think they are cool.
1400032717|5.0|This is an amazing novel, a tour-de-force. The author tells the story of a murdered dog and the search to discover who murdered the dog from the point of view of an autistic teen, Christopher John Francis Boone. It is Christopher who finds the dog lying dead on his neighbor's lawn, and it is Christopher who will not give up trying to discover who murdered the dog. One of the things I liked about this book was that it took me to new places: I was able to imagine how the world seems to a teen who is autistic. And in seeing the world from such a different perspective, I was able to see how stress turns people into somebody they don't want to be. But, when confronted with the selves they don't want to be (and Christopher helps adults in confronting themselves), some people can become better. This is a sad story, but the ending is uplifting and hopeful.
0553386794|4.0|I blame it on my generation; we love our action and fast-paced plots, multi-tasking, and bright shiny things.  At times I found myself trudging along, but I believe part of that is due to having seen the HBO series first: it is hard to get wrapped-up in a book when you know what is going to happen.  However, I am glad I read the book.  The television series is exciting, the book more so.  I have already made it through book 2 and almost done with book 3.  If only I didn't have to work, I probably devour the rest of the series within a week.

B003TH2LA8|5.0|This show deserved a third season.  Even though it's not completely true to the books, give it a shot and you may end up liking it. I know I did.
030758836X|2.0|The book was initially very engaging.....slowly drifted off to tedium.  The bulk of the story was exciting, as the reader is not sure which of the two main characters, to  believe.<br />I really enjoyed a good chunk of the narrative, however.......  It was the last 15-20 percent of the book that was ridiculous.  The entire ending was quite awful and felt like that term paper you just had to rush to finish and turned in a sloppy, any thing will do piece of work.  I do not recommend this book, it ended up being a waste of time and it seemed so promising.
030758836X|2.0|The interest is in watching the web tighten and then how these people play out their story though the media. Both aspects are fascinating.  Unfortunately, the perfect ending is also stepford creepy/sickening, and made me sorry I read the book.

B004EPYZOO|4.0|\\"Nicholas Cage stars as an undead felon who breaks out of Hell...\\" those 12 words seem like enough reason to blow off this film, but I was glad to have taken a chance on Drive Angry. The plot is ridiculous, the action sequences are ridiculous, the villains are uber ridiculous, yet the extreme absurdity somehow evolved into something totally entertaining. At one point, Cage kills eight men while having sex. I thought only Chuck Noriss could pull that off. Drive Angry has all the makings of a cult classic...give it 5 to 10 years. Amber Heard stole the show as Piper; a mouthy, no-nonsense waitress blessed with a wicked right hook. Ms. Heard is a talented actress capable of tackling any character type, but a few more tough-chick roles like this could rank her as one of Hollywood's top female bad-asses. William Fichtner's role as Hell's snarky accountant is one of the more memorable and entertaining characters of the year. Drive angry is worth a look for those who enjoy theatrical violence and B-movie derivation.
0553582038|2.0|For part four of his \\"Song of Ice and Song\\" saga, George Martin explained that he had written so much that he decided to divide it into two books that straddle the same timeline:  \\"A Feast for Crows\\" and \\"Dance of Dragons.\\"  He would have better off just throwing out \\"A Feast of Crows\\" if he were overly concerned that one book would break the wrists of his teenage and adult fans.<br /><br />This book is a disappointing and pointless affair, full of new minor characters that add little to the development, and indeed distract from the main story.  It also comes across as very undisciplined, and it seems that perhaps the captain has lost control of his own ship.  This saga would have been a tremendous trilogy, but seven books seem a bit long.  And now it seems that we'll have more than seven, I suspect (part four should be when the major villains are introduced, and that has not happened yet).<br /><br />George Martin may be the American Tolkien, but Tolkien knew when to quit and not try the patience of his fans.

0345535421|5.0|\\"A Game of Thrones\\" was good, and the sequel \\"A Clash of Kings\\" is even better.  What makes this book such an absorbing and entertaining read is how the author does not presume to challenge our intelligence or our sensitivities.  George Martin knows that inevitably teenage boys will be drawn to this book (and most of the heroes tend to be teenagers, or individuals -- such as the dwarf Tyrion Lannister -- that teenager boys can most readily identify with), but he doesn't try to simplify the moral complexity and nastiness that is politics.<br /><br />What also makes this book such a fun read is how Martin effortlessly blends genres together, mainly history and fantasy.  He tells us that the book is inspired by the War of the Roses, and even the names of the warring clans in this book (Stark and Lannister) sound similar to the York and Lancaster houses that warred against each other.  But Martin also draws in other historical families as well, most notably the Borgia family which strikes an eery semblance to the Lannister clan.<br /><br />The best part of the book is Tyrion Lannister, the most morally complex character.  He's part Richard III (that's bad), but he's also part Hunchback of Notre Dame (slightly better).
B0054PSY2W|5.0|*** THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE 2011 ALL-REGIONS BLU RAY REISSUE ***<br /><br />\\"Hot Damn! It's The Soggy Bottom Boys!\\"<br /><br />When the Coen Brothers unleashed \\"O Brother, Where Art Thou?\\" into cinemas in September 2000 - it was an audio and visual sensation. The DVD that followed in 2001 received equal praise. But little will prepare fans for this truly beautiful 2011 BLU RAY transfer - it's properly gorgeous to look at - and up there with the best this (often frustrating) format can offer...<br /><br />When it was originally filmed on location - a 'lossless' digital process was used to fully realise the specific light and scenery of Depression-hit Mississippi in 1937 (beautiful gold and yellow hues). That process combined with the stunning cinematography of Roger Deakins both get to shine like never before. There are times when the visuals are quite literally breathtaking in their clarity. And the canvas to impress your eyes just keeps coming at you as the movie progresses from location to location - open fields, hay barns, twisted swamps, dust roads, river banks, inside period cars and beat-up trucks, the chain-gang detail, radio stations and bank interiors. Even in the notoriously difficult indoor scenes in ramshackle homesteads and around campfires at night - it all looks 'so' good. Add to this a blisteringly funny script full of savvy life-observations and brutal local colloquialisms - and it's hardly surprising that it was nominated for 2 Academy Awards in these areas (Best Script and Cinematography).<br /><br />Defaulted to 2.35:1 aspect ratio - it has bars top and bottom of the screen - but even when stretched to full screen - it rarely loses any definition. And better news for fans around the world is that this issue is an 'ABC/All Regions' BLU RAY - so it will play on every machine (as well as PlayStation 3 consoles).<br /><br />Written and Directed by brothers Joel and Ethan Coen - \\"O Brother, Where Art Thou?\\" comes across as a sort of Three Stooges Road Movie with song accompaniment. Roughly based on Homer's Greek tragedy \\"The Iliad\\" about a journey of salvation with many \\"ob-stack-les\\" along the weary way - its genius soundtrack also sparked a worldwide interest in Blues, Gospel and Old Timey Country music - much of which had been long forgotten and often derided as hick and corny (2011 saw a 2CD 'Deluxe Edition' reissue of this). The film was immediately followed by the DVD release of the \\"Down From The Mountain\\" concert in Nashville, Tennessee featuring live music played by musicians on the Grammy-winning soundtrack. Anyone who has seen it will know that it's an equally joyful and musically charged experience. This is America before the sadness and loss of 9/11 - enjoying itself and celebrating its heritage - and rightly so.<br /><br />The large and varied cast is exceptional - especially the grotesque caricatures that pepper scene after scene. Quinn Gasaway as a gun-totting boy in filthy overalls, Stephen Root as the bug-eyed giggling recording studio boss, John Goodman as the dodgy Bible salesman Big Dan Teague whose ears pop up when he hears the crisp click of dollar bills in a restaurant. His eye-patch signals him as the club-wielding one-eyed Cyclops. Wayne Duvall as the hood-wearing racist Homer Stokes trying to get elected over Charles Durning - the portly but wily Governor of Mississippi - Pappy \\"Pass The Biscuits\\" O'Daniel who also hosts a radio show. So many great parts...<br /><br />The story goes something like this - chained together as a trio of escaped convicts - they are driven to find a $1.2 million dollar treasure Everett is supposed to have hidden in a shack in a valley that is to be flooded in five days time to build a massive hydro-electric dam. But they are being pursued by the Devil in sunglasses with his mean dog - Sheriff Cooley (played with relish by Daniel Von Bargen). After visiting a relative of Pete's called Wash (a man who rarely does) - the boys are hounded off the farm yet again.They then meet a Negro called Tommy Johnson at a crossroads and give him a lift (superbly played by Louisiana guitarist Chris Thomas King). He explains that at midnight the night before he sold his immortal soul to the Devil in return for a guitar that he \\"sure can play\\" (like the folklore surrounding Blues legend Robert Johnson). Delmar is appalled but Everett sees a business opportunity. If they can get to a radio station on the outskirts of the State - there's a man there who'll give them money to \\"sing into a can\\". They eventually get there - pretend to be The Soggy Bottom Boys - do a charged rendition of \\"I Am A Man Of Constant Sorrow\\" - and cut a record. But unbeknown to the hapless crew - a radio hit is born that will literally save their souls (and lives) in the end. But before they can get to that redemption of sorts - all sorts of journey hilarity ensues - including a reunion between Everett and his estranged wife Penny (Holly Hunter) and their 4-strong progeny of mouthy daughters. There are gun-battles with a madcap bank robber George 'Baby Face' Nelson who shoots livestock because he hates cows (a fantastic turn by Coens' favourite Michael Badalucco) and sexy Sirens by the river who turn Pete into a horny toad. It all ends with tins of Dapper Dan pomade floating by the screen when the big flood comes (along with everything else)...<br /><br />The music deserves a special mention. While audiences expected to howl with laughter and cringe at the array of unhygienic ingrates displayed on screen - what they hadn't expected was to be so moved by the old-timey music - full of ballads about heartbreak, poverty and death. A perfect example is The Cox Family singing \\"I Am Weary (Give Me Rest)\\" on a truck at a town gathering - the melody and lyrics are genuinely moving. The congregation making their way through the trees to the river to be baptised as they sing (Acapella) \\"Down To The River To Pray\\". Country and Blues musicians also have on-and-off-camera cameos - Clooney lip-synching in the recording booth is really being sung by Dan Tyminski of Alison Krauss' band Union Station - Gillian Welch asking for a copy of the song in a record shop - Alison Krauss, Gillian Welch and Emmylou Harris provide the Acapella vocals as the seductive Sirens on the river - Ralph Stanley of The Stanley Brothers singing \\"O Death\\" as Tommy is led by a lynch mob to a gallows and a burning cross - The Fairfield Four Gospel group singing as they dig graves by a log cabin...<br /><br />But the movie belongs to the three principal leads - John Turturro as the permanently moaning Pete Hogwallop and Tim Blake Nelson as the less than Mensa-material Delmar O'Donnell (a role he would revive to great effect in \\"Flypaper\\" - see review). There is a rare and completely believable chemistry between them. But the big revelation here is George Clooney playing the philosophy-jabbering Everett Ulysses McGill. While he doesn't quite reach the cult-inducing peaks of Jeff Bridges as 'The Dude' in the Coens incomparable \\"The Big Lebowski\\" (a part emblazoned into cinema lover's hearts forever) - Clooney shows a deftness of touch for comedy and pathos throughout that is quite fantastic. More importantly he seemed to finally park his devastatingly handsome good looks by taking a career chance and showing the world that he was more than just a pretty face. Clooney can act his soggy pants off if given the right part (something he's proved many times since).<br /><br />The only real let down is the paltry extras (those that accompanied the initial DVD issue) which last only a few minutes and leave you craving more.<br /><br />Still - this is a fantastic advertisement for what BLU RAY can offer. I only wish I had a humungous home-cinema system to watch it on.<br /><br />To sum up - after they fail to catch a passing train full of men with \\"aimless lives of wandering...\\" Delmar is asked by the other two squabblers to give the deciding vote on who is leader of the trio. Delmar sappily says - \\"I'm with you fellas!\\"<br /><br />I wholeheartedly agree.<br /><br />BLU RAY Specifications:<br />VIDEO: 1080p High Definition - Aspect Radio 2.35:1<br />AUDIO: English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio and Spanish 2.0 Dolby Digital<br />SUBTITLES: English SDH (Hard Of Hearing), French and Spanish<br /><br />EXTRAS:<br />1.

055357342X|4.0|While not as riveting as the previous two books, \\"A Storm of Swords\\" is still exciting to read because it adds so many twists and turns to the already complex plot.  New characters are introduced and new enemies emerge, but what keeps the book fun to read are the old characters that we have come to love and hate.
B004FHCH96|4.0|I've never seen anything like this before, refreshing and original(mainly in the way the story is told). Nolan can never top this with his later attempts(although Batman Begins is such a memoroble superhero tale which I'd place in my top 5 superhero movies of all time). Then he made the massively overrated Dark Knight and Inception. I think he is lost in these big budget Hollywood movies and tries too hard to distinguish his movies from other blockbusters that in the end he forgets why he makes these films in the first place: just to entertain. I will see Dark Knight Rises and will always respect him as a visionary filmmaker(or once was) because of this masterpiece. Lionsgate's bluray is topnotch in every aspect and is a worthy addition to your library.

I believe there are 2 moments in the album that are the peaks of Ten, Pearl Jam and music overall. The ending of Jeremy (oooohhh....) and the ending of Release. Those heights say something about Pearl Jam that no other musician or band has ever said. Only Kurt had been close to it at Where did you sleep last night.

My 3 year old sings the songs all the time, which is a pleasant escape from typical preschool songs.  My 13 year old was inspired to pick up his bible and read the actual story!  And my 9 year old loves the blinged-out costumes, the children's ensemble and dancing.  While I whole-heartedly think this is a family show, I do have 2 parental warnings: One is the lack of costumes on the female cast.  \\"Everything\\" is covered, but the female costumes resemble a Vegas show. And the second warning is the brief seduction scene with Joseph and Potipher's wife.  Again, nothing is actually shown, but there is a lot of groping and sexual inference. So parents of younger viewers beware.  Other than that, this is a really good production...lots of talent, music and fun.  I highly recommend it!

B008K8H9C6|1.0|This game was advertised on my T-Mobile G2 phone while I was playing Angry Birds. It looked like it might be fun so I bought the game and got a receipt for it. Every time I tried to download and install it, I got a message that I needed to have WI-FI to use this game. Finally, I was in a WI-FI area and it downloaded. But when I went to install it, I got the message that it needed an android phone to play. I really thought my phone was an android, it seems to be for other games.<br />If I ever figure out how to make this work on my phone, I might be able to give it a higher rating. But for now, I am out $.99 and the game gets one star for not warning me that my phone would not work ahead of time.

B005AKFXZW|5.0|Do yourself a favour and forget the hype as it so often taints a person's perception.<br /><br />If you are drawn to the concept in the synopsis and want something with a touch of magic, get this book. It's sweet, captivating and gently romantic with a swirling storyline.<br /><br />The circus is enthralling. I desperately wanted to discover more about the secrets hidden in the tents along with the amazing characters.<br /><br />I doubt I'd watch the movie - there's just no possible way to recreate the images her words have inspired in my imagination.<br /><br />This may not be for everyone, but I truly loved it.<br /><br />(I can't believe I used words like 'magic' and 'enthralling'. I guess this book has just brought it out in me!)

B00563M11M|4.0|Terry Pratchett. I've been reading and enjoying his work for ages now.<br /><br />And overall, this book didn't disappoint. I found some of the sentences too ... long?. Or maybe too convoluted? Not in his usual fun twisty-turny way, but maybe too much info at one time?<br /><br />It was slightly more serious than some of the other novels but I do love the characters.<br /><br />In saying that, I wish there were more of our favourite Watch members around. And maybe more time in Ankh Morpork.<br /><br />Come to think of it, that little thing missing from the book was maybe just a bit of Discworld.<br /><br />Am still looking forward to his next installment.

0345803485|2.0|But this book reads like a Harlequin, twisted with daytime soap drama, peppered with teen spirit and wrapped in Desperate Housewives.  I couldn't get past page 26. = 
B00701L5XS|3.0|The app really comes off as an impressive one with the 3D and 360* rotation but reading all of the scary reviews about privacy;  and other trash embedded in the app, I will regretfully be forced to delete it. If all of this is true, when I see it is cleaned up, I will be back to purchase it.
B0079XPUOW|4.0|Although I read my first SF before author John Scalzi was born and have been enjoying it pretty steadily since (interrupted only during periods when academic or professional demands reduced my pleasure reading almost to zero), I am not a TV fan or moviegoer and had not even heard the term \\"Redshirt\\" until this book was published. Nonetheless I hugely enjoyed Redshirts.<br /><br />Thank you to the many other reviewers who COULD have spoiled a lot of the fun by giving too many details of the story. I will try to follow their good example and will omit a story synopsis entirely.<br /><br />Redshirts might sound like it is going to be action-packed space opera, but actually it belongs to the subgenre of SF dubbed \\"philosofiction\\", more interested in exploring the frontiers of human nature than those of outer space, as the main characters realize they are doomed to lead shortened lives and fight to have some control over their destinies. I believe I have read that Scalzi majored in philosophy as an undergraduate, and if so, it shows. Nonetheless, it IS very funny; it doesn't take itself too seriously.<br /><br />I could ALMOST have rated this a 5,but I think Scalzi let his enthusiasm for his coda idea cloud his judgment. Redshirts bills itself as \\"a novel with three codas\\". The novel itself concludes very nicely and would have been excellent without the codas. The three codas are short pieces, each of which presents the effect of the main story on the resulting life of a different supporting character. Two of these match the style and tone of the rest of the book and are a nice addition. The first coda, however, is very different in form and in language and disrupts the unity of the book. This is a relatively minor flaw,but it was very disappointing to find it in a book that was otherwise so enjoyable and so well-done.
B00701L5XS|1.0|Spyware crap.... Pass..... And here are more words so I can leave the review. Actually I'm not sure how many words I need.
030758836X|2.0|Whereas Gillian Flynn has an amazing way with words and characterization and an incredible way of twisting the reader around with her intricate plotting, I found it very difficult to like either of the main characters.  They are beyond flawed and by the end of the book I frankly didn't give a damn what happened to either one of them. Not to give anything away, I have to agree with other reviewers who were not happy with the way the book ended.
B005K17RU0|4.0|Had some slight issues with it at first on my fire but it all works for me now. I like the interface.
B00095NX9G|2.0|Based on the reviews, I thought this would be great intro to belly dancing.  If I had a dance back ground, I think this would be perfect.  The yoga section is elementary.  The beginning of the dance section goes from zero to 60 in 3 seconds.  Too hard to follow.  Not interesting to watch.  Money wasted...
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|good strategy game.  the ads telling you to share your status are annoying. words words words words words words words
B0008ENIAC|5.0|I just loved this movie.  My mother told me about it quite a few years ago and I finally saw it the other night.  What a great story line about a mother's devotion to her children and the evil and greediness from a child.  Joan Crawford surely was wonderful in this movie.  I thoroughly enjoyed it.

0061766089|4.0|Tim Brown, the author of this book is the CEO of IDEO the well known design company that has won several awards and created innovative products and design for many industries. IDEO has always been on the forefront of design innovation. In this book, Tim Brown lays down the principles of design innovation and gives us a view into the IDEO approach.<br /><br />Tim shows that some of the most brilliant ideas are not fully formed but are made so by careful research and rigorous experimentation. Design Thinking explains how great design stems from a more collaborative process than an individual exploring an idea. Some great new products have come to the world through individuals who spent countless hours thinking and experimenting with their ideas before they designed a product, great design can also come from a sustained and collaborative team approach. Especially when design ideas have to be channeled to meet current consumer needs under given resource constraints.<br /><br />All good ideas start somewhere - this book shows how individuals' creative powers can be channeled through process and teamwork to create good design. Tim lays out the design process as - Inspiration - Ideation and - Implementation and talks through various design principles such as Analysis and Synthesis, Convergent and Divergent thinking etc.<br /><br />Tim gives several examples of how some new products and services were created through starting with a problem - such as \\"How can Bank of America retain current customers and bring in new ones?\\" Out of that process the new service \\"Keep the Change\\" was born.<br /><br />IDEO, of course, has many other successful examples that are not discussed in this book, but through the principles discussed in this book they have been able to bring some innovative products and services to the market that have made life better for most of us. I recommend this book for anyone trying to innovate.<br /><br />If you like this book, also check out the IDEO website where they have explained more fundamental concepts on how they bring innovation to the world.re they have explained more fundamental concepts on how they bring innovation to the world.
B007TNS6JI|1.0|i had to delete literally all of my apps and games for this one and its not even that big of a game im not really smart when it comes to tech but i dont see a reason this is so big
B005K17RU0|3.0|its not the greatest app ever.. I prefer other weather apps... but its okay. useful if ur just quickly checking for what to wear due to weather.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love this game! Biggest downfall is it is terribly hard to put down. That and the babies run away way too quick in my opinion. But other than that, I love it!!<br />(and I had saved up enough acorns to open a new nursery, went to open it, and all my acorns mysteriously disappeared?)
B007SYWFRM|5.0|one of the best apps ive encountered in a long time it would be great to see more like it
034580404X|5.0|I just loved this series... I haven't read a book in years. I heard about it on the tv and thought I'd give it a go.<br />I borrowed my daughters kindle and off I went. 5 days later with a few bags under my eyes i finished it all. I just couldn't put it down,<br />I just had to know what was going to happen next. I think at some stage I even had a tear in my eye. Congratulations to the author. Hoping for some more.<br />And thank you for getting be back into reading. Cheers Kylie
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|yeehaw ....tons of fun!  makes you learn to juggle all needs of the town.  wish you could get more lives faster.
B0071XO8RA|2.0|Although the writing in itself has a certain flair, the story completely failed to hold me. Was completly misguided by the 5 star reviews. I guess you can not argue about colors or taste, but I learned my lesson and will check now first the 'bad' comments before purchasing. Normally I don't take the time to put a review, but this time I was just too disappointed (and again, this is just my opinion/taste).<br /><br />Also striking is how 5 star reviewers jump on the 'bad' comments,... reminds me of Facebook and especially the reason why I stopped using FB.<br /><br />Enjoy reading everyone, don't argue about other peoples opinion/taste.<br /><br />Maybe some advise for Amazon:<br />I remember a site where you had to go through a whole bunch of things to say if you like them or not. Sort of product interest profiling. Make this OPTION possible and keep in account also the dislikes and comments on books. If you have a good profiling on me for my suggested items I will buy without looking :) (the wool omnibus was in my suggestion list, probably because I read some PA novels. That's not enough to put the Wool omnibus in there for me.)<br /><br />Greetz,<br />Soulexporter
B005K17RU0|5.0|This app works great and has a lot of useful information about health.  It goes way beyond just weather forecasts and shows a better radar of the surrounding area.  The video links are what pushed me to go with this app over the others.
B008MEM24S|5.0|I love this game! it is so fun! I love that they made oil come into the game. I also like the ballooney levels. Good job Disney!!!!!
1423101502|5.0|This book is the last book of the percy Jackson series. There is fighting from the beginning to the end. I stayed up all night reading this book because it has great adventure. It is a Greek myth book that teaches Greek mythology.<br />My favorite character is Annabeth because she really rates to Luke. I like these books even more than Harry Potter. I wish this series did not end. Caitlin G
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I loved it but once you do all the times all your trying to do is beat your time...which I'm not crazy about!
B008MEM24S|5.0|Disney did it again! Where's My Perry is fun for adults and kids.  We are having a blast collecting the gnomes.
B007IXWL2C|1.0|One book of this type of sex was enough, but three UGH.  Anastasia is a weak, passive individual.  What happens when they turn 50.  I am sure not Grey.
B007SGM084|5.0|I loved the trilogy and would highly recommend it.  It's everything you could want in a romance.  Pretty steamy too!
B0063IH60K|1.0|I enjoyed playing this game until lately.  Now at the start of every hand a pop up ad takes over which you can not get out of except by exiting the game (pressing the home key on the kindle fire).  You can then restart the game and play that 1 hand before getting another pop up that takes over.<br />I will be deleting this app from my unit.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|The app works just fine on my HTC G2. Smooth easy interface, works fast, and of course you can join the world and &quot;instigram&quot; your photos on your mobile device or just take a good photo that needs a bit more color &amp; some vignetting to make it pop. This is a great app for all that.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Three stars for this game.  Has some interesting games, a good way to kill some time but has too many ads.
034580404X|4.0|Although bodice-rippers have been around for a long time and all females that read continually are aware of the paragraphs in all books that are really graphic, the Grey series adds a surprise of sexual scenes that are a little different than the norm.  I didn't find them offensive although others might.  Depends on how liberal you are.
B0077SGMXM|5.0|As the title says I really hate this game. What I hate most about it is how addictive it is. I just can't put it away and that to me is the true test of a successful game.
B008JGSM6G|3.0|This game is simple enough to play when your killing time, but complex enough to require thought.  addictive. and fun, a must for any game library.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I am so addicted to this game, it is super fun! It's all the fun of a tap game plus ice age characters. What's not to love!? Can't put it down!
B004UMVW7E|2.0|Book was advertised as good condition but was actually in fair condition.  There was writing and highlighting throughout the book.
034580404X|1.0|Bought the whole Trilogy.  Could not finish the first book.  It is written from a very childlike point of view with little characterization and no emotionalism.  Simplistic sentences.  I just could not get into it.  The two primary characters are very shallow and one dimensional.  No emotional draw what so ever.  I was just plain bored.  I donated it to a reading group to see their reaction.  For me, it was all hype with no follow through.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this game is fun and long lasting the updates keep getting better and I have been plaint to for anlong time now its great totally worth playing
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Whenever I see that Ken Follett has written another book, I know I'm going to buy it. And a big, fat volume is even more enticing. This book is no exception. The writing is effortless and carries you through the complex story lines as if you were living them yourself. The historical research is impeccable as usual - you come to understand how the First World War came to be and why it was so bloody and terrible. You feel how it was to live in the US, Britain, Germany and Russia at that time in history. The characters are real people you can relate to. I'm looking forward to the next book in the trilogy.
B00004YTIQ|3.0|So I had a hard time putting the cover on my pool today by myself.  I wish it said somewhere that it is recommended that two people are needed for putting it on.  My main issue is that it doesn't cover the pool tightly like the picture and there is a big pool of water in the middle from it sagging down.  Any solutions on how to make it so it doesn't sag and get filled with water?
B007MNV5WU|4.0|This is a great game, and the gravity physics are amazing, but there are too few levels... But future updates will probably solve that.
B0033H7VI6|5.0|For under $40, this product deserves six stars.  Uses the same excellent steel as the more expensive blades from Ka-Bar's Becker series and the Ontario RAT series (I have several of these other brands for comparison).  Very thick, tough blade.  Decent coating to minimize rust on the 1095 carbon steel.  Nice sheath with lots of attachment points for upgrades and including a smaller knife, firesteel, sharpener, multitool, flashlight, etc.  I will be buying a couple more of these as backup blades while they are available.  Strong recommendation if you need a heavy fixed blade for anything from gardening to building wilderness shelters.<br /><br />Update: Just ordered my second one while the price is still under $40.  My four Ka-Bar Beckers are nice, but they are staying the drawer.
B006DRVFRQ|5.0|I was looking for a long time for a good res reader for my google reader feeds. this is it. found it.
B007SSDS24|4.0|I've been wanting to watched this movie since the first time I saw the trailer. I believe, this is an interesting one. I would prefer to watch this over Paranormal Activity or any other movies which trying to fool others insinuating as \\"based-on-a real story\\" claims which is not even close to be real.<br /><br />So we're done with Zombies and Dinasaurs eating people..Now Aliens Formed as Energy Can Kill ?!?<br /><br />Whatever! The writer is brilliant as he tried to divert against the usual redundant stories of different writers with same and copy-cat plots of a story. 4STARS!!!
B0044WUIHA|5.0|Enjoyable movie that explores the trials of solitude and survival on a tropical island. I've always enjoyed this movie and I recommend it to any who haven't seen it yet.
B0062QRTKA|5.0|yes its based off the Bible (but seriously it dosnt mock religion because its NOT a Bible). but its a GREAT game. an original idea, no suspicious permissions, and a low price with no IAP. completely worth the money! cant wait to find more by these people... always find indie games are the best ones..
B002I0J5FG|4.0|Both games were pretty fun. Ico had decent puzzles but wasn't very engrossing. The Shadow of Colossus was difficult at first but once you crest the learning curve the game is enjoyable. Be warned that both games are NOT average PS3 quality. They seem a bit less populated and the graphics are less than spectacular. For that reason I knocked a star off. If you can get around that and you enjoy puzzle games then I recommend giving these a go.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This is cool.U dnt do much but the coin collecting and missions keep me coming back.At first i was gnna erase it but after i played awhile i knew tht i just COULDNT.So try it.Give it awhile.And i promise it will all b worth it.aand Its FREE!!!SO HURRY GO CATCH U SOME SCRAT
B008MEM24S|5.0|I got this game thinking &quot; ehh it wont be as good as where's my water&quot; but its really fun!!
B008MEM24S|5.0|love it cant play enough of it I to have a kindle fire and it works great maybe the other people have to much down loaded
B008MEM24S|1.0|free free free free free free free free  i cant get this stinkin game cuz its not free make an ad version that can be free cum on disney u hit a home run with wheres my water  u can do this to defensless kids
B007N3A2F0|5.0|The CD is amaizing. Incredible band and remarcable album.<br />It even arrived earlier than expected and in perfect conditions.<br /><br />Absolutely recommended.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|LOVE THIS BOOK!  I really had a hard time getting into book 1...hated Christian, just thought it all to be too much.  This book really brings in the love story.  He truly LOVES Ana and it's evident that they are both \\"saving\\" each other in a sense.  I oouldn't put it down.  LOVED the picture into Christian's past...onto book three!
B003V4AK8E|2.0|First let me say that I had high hopes for this controller. There doesn't appear to be any other third party controller xbox likes that parallel this one in quality. Unfortunately there were some poor design decisions. The grips of the controller are textured with this extremely rough design. After handling it for an hour my hands were raw from holding on to it. Like other reviews there is a rather large dead zone that affects all games. Unlike the 360 controller, the grips fade in to the back leaving nothing for your middle finger to grip.This is maddening when looking for a controller for larger hands. It was a good try, but no cigar.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I had a REALLY hard time getting into this book.  I thought Christian to be an arrogant jerk...and Ana a naive virgin...BUT, the more I read, the more I could see what all the hype was about.  Don't give up reading this book...it will all come together in the end.  I LOVE THIS TRILOGY.  The sex, the love story, etc.
B00701L5XS|1.0|Crashed my phone the second I opened it. Had to do a factory reset on it to get it to work again.
B00008977N|5.0|Ok, you have to be a Peter Gabriel fan or at least know who and what he is and what he has done (creator of Genesis) , he is one of those seminal, truly original artists who you either love or hate, having seen him live several times I think this is one of the best sounding live recordings of his work. The band is superb, the mix is great, Paula Cole singing backup (and loving it) when she is a great artist and songwriter in her own right,shows the gravitas of PG within music circles, she's not just some backup singer. Listen to her song Hush,Hush,Hush if it doesn't break you heart then you deserve the drivel that passes for music nowadays.<br /><br />I would have liked more of his early songs but you can't have everything.<br /><br />If you are younger and think Lady Gaga, Justin Bieber & other computer generated Corporate Musak is great then this is probably not for you.
B0073XORCY|4.0|Though admittedly I have never given a thought to whatever happened to Gerald Bostock, I was pleased to hear from him here. The music is tight, well played and pleasantly reminiscent of the original. Having been a fan of Tull over (too many years) I was sad to see Martin Barre MIA but Florian Opahle is up to the task of filling that void, playing tastily without being overbearing, redundant or superfluous. John O'hara, David Goodier and Scott Hammond also provide their excellent skills.  Ian Anderson has always retained his pithiness and edge and does not disappoint.<br /><br />If you did not care for TAAB 1 you won't like this, but I liked 1 and so far have found 2 an interesting well executed album.<br /><br />Aside to Ian Anderson: Snoop Dog called and wants his hat back.... please give it to him. :)
0895260131|4.0|This is the second P.I.G. book I've read and it's a keeper. It provides an good history of the religion, Mohammed and the Crusades, and does so without regard for stepping on those with PC toes. In fact, much of this book may really tick off those intent on portraying Islam as a peaceful religion. It provides a much-needed balance to the predominantly pro-Islam message in our mainstream media and frankly, I was hoping it might give me a warmer and fuzzier feeling about the religion and its followers.  However, it didn't and that causes me concern.<br /><br />Read this book to learn more about Islam and Muslims, but understand going in that it's not PC.  Gee, I guess that's the whole idea!

B00009AOBI|1.0|i appreciate bruce springsteen he is one of my favorite artists,but to change all the bob seger songs in favor of the boss is b.s.! i bought this movie thinking i'm getting the origional 80's movie i grew up with but i was wrong! the added footage turns an awesome vmovie into a complete abortion!i hate the copy i have and i would love to know where i can buy a dvd of the origional version! anyone else who contemplates buying this directors cut just run this director don't know his butt from a hole in the ground! i am just glad there was a movie studio around in the beginning to keep director Peter Bogdanovich from turning the origional release in to a train wreck like he did the dvd release!
B003TSEL7S|5.0|Rick thank you for adding to my addiction and making it so I can be lost in this world again!
B005LAIGRS|5.0|The plot was good and the movie was well made, not cheap, and the action was good. Plus I enjoy Denzels acting projects and this one was no different.
B00280LYHS|5.0|Really sad day when this series was over good news Rick has another series for me to fall in love with!
B005LAIGYQ|5.0|To me this movie offered a different view of 'Special Forces' types. These were well trained seals that had real families and faced real mission mis-haps like every person working on every projects. However the action was good. I liked the movie enough to buy the dvd and will watch it again.

B007SYWFRM|5.0|very fun and entertaining . I love watching the families. grow. I catch myself cheching in on them all day long. must play game!
B004JZBGWI|4.0|I absolutely love this app! I have many lists and notes saved there.  I especially love the color coding. Since I can make notes different colors, I am able to organize them by categories.  ex. Red for medical notes, blue for my personal movie list and books-to-read list, yellow for what to pack on our upcoming trip, etc.  Items within each list can also be edited. The order can be switched.<br /><br />One drawback... items are checked off with a light tap.  Too light!  Very often I check items off accidentally.  I would appreciate an update that requires double clicking in order to mark an item as complete.<br /><br />Otherwise one of the best apps I own!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I got this app and I played it for a few hours and I have not had a single problem with it.it is on my kindle fire.iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii lllllloovvvvvveeee iiiiiiiiiiittttttttttt!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0079R8KXG|5.0|This case is a lovely, rich, red color. It is well made and highly functional. It both covers the Kindle Fire and serves as as a stand to hold the Fire upright in multiple viewing positions. The cover is smooth and easy to clean. There is an elastic strap that holds the cover closed rather than a snap buckle, which I would have preferred, but this is my only complaint.
B008EQIEWS|2.0|I was terribly disappointed, shocked in fact that this sequel with its star cast could be so awful.  Thrilled I didn't go see this at the theater, I would have been steaming upset.  It's not worth the current price to pay on Amazon either, wait till it's free.  At least you won't be upset with yourself that you spent money on this, just be upset that you bothered to waste your time.  Oh well, you've been warned.
B008CWD17M|4.0|To be honest, I found their previous two releases to be both weak and weird (and I was shocked how many people said they were good).  Each had one or two good songs and then some waaayyy out there stuff such as Listen Children (turn that one up loud for your friends and get ready for some strange looks).  Honestly I had kind of given up on them after Omega.<br /><br />This release is different - much better, less \\"weirdness\\" if you will.  Still a bit of religious undertone, but less than the previous releases.<br /><br />I do find it strange that people think XXX is reverse loaded.  The songs are all pretty good through Judas and then they go downhill fast.  Maybe people are listening to XXX in reverse order?  Because Reno, Ghost of A change and I Know How you Feel are probably the three weakest songs on XXX.<br /><br />I would also agree that XXX seems to be made up of Wetton's singing and some of Downe's keyboards.  But Palmer's drums and Howe's guitar are very muted (almost as if Carl said I'll play on the CD but I don't want people to hear me).  In fact, some of his drumming almost sounds like it is a machine! In short, while Wetton's voice is incredible, I'd like to hear the rest of the band too.<br /><br />So in short, if you have not heard ASIA since they re-formed, pick up XXX and give it a listen.
B007MJ9LA2|5.0|My understanding is these are tracks hanging around in the vault. I love Santana, he has been thru many phases. I like this cd which is instrumental. It reminds me of earlier years, a little like \\"Barboletta & Welcome\\" I would have bought it even if it was not that great, but I was pleasantly surprised. Listen to the sample tracks on Amazon & place your order. I don't think you will be disappointed. Thank You
B008MEM24S|1.0|this should be free I mean on the commercials they say its free so I'm not goin to buy it

B000001DYY|4.0|Roland on his own as producer, songwriter, and instrumental performer is not something to be afraid of. Given his obsessive tendencies when crafting songs, not having Curt Smith let him write the music he wished to make here (and the solid follow-up Raoul and the Kings of Spain album). Not to say that you will hear something completely different from the band's first three albums: the record is still \\"Tears for Fears\\" in sound and spirit.<br /><br />I am not a fan genres like pop nor new wave, but as a progressive rock fan, I can appreciate when artists experiment within the boundaries of such genres. This album has very strong melodies scattered throughout its 10 tracks as well as a surprising amount of textural depth. For example, the opening track opens with two rhythmical patterns in 4/4 and 5/4 simultaneously, has highly memorable vocal melodies and rich textures. The record occasionally suffers from dated keyboard sounds, but Roland can somehow make brilliant uses of them, particularly with the repetitive keyboard riff dominating the epic sound of \\"Mr. Pessimist\\". Do not be alarmed, as he chooses a very colorful palette of sounds that sound very organic and timeless, despite the polished nature of the production.<br /><br />My favorite track is \\"Gas Giants\\", a psychedelic instrumental with an aura of melancholia with great use of multiple layers of keyboards and an improvisational bass guitar. The previously mentioned \\"Mr Pessimist\\" is another highlight with a sparse, epic sound and an experimental song structure with lack of a distinctive chorus. The song \\"Power\\" also is expertly crafted and benefits from a heavy rock sound. \\"Brian Wilson Said\\" chooses to layer itself with multiple vocal tracks and sounds beautiful in a retro sense. Other songs unmentioned are solid in their own way and can sometimes blend to each other.<br /><br />I recommend this album for listeners who care about top-notch melodies and intelligent songwriting without the usage of avant-garde elements.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|After hearing all the hype for this book, I finally broke down and bought it.  I am shocked at what American woman consider good reading these days.  This book reads like it was written by a 12 year old.  Grammar, sentence structure, story development, ect are all so horribly awful I had to force myself to keep reading.  I kept thinking, surely it must get better......  No such luck.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|My boys (9 &amp; 3) and I are having fun playing this game together!!  Just not willing to spend my own money to purchase anything and that makes it hard to explain to them why we cant purchase certain animals and activities.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book take you to a very interesting place. Meaning if you are having a problem with your libito, read this book as well as the others. I just finished book 2 and my goodness I couldn't put it down. Absolutly breath taking. I'm about to start book 3.
0439023513|2.0|Truthfully I really want to like this book, but overall as others have said it felt so rushed. I think it was more just to get the story to an end point so she could move on to her next project and not have publishers pushing for this book. I understand the way that war turns people, but to not go into detail or emotion about some of the deaths in the book when there was so much good writing and emotional input about Rue's death in the first book. I feel that the end was just the first thing that came to mind, slapped on a page and given to the publisher. No thought or creativity was put into the last half of this book.
B0086700CM|4.0|fun and addictive great app it drives me crazy jump slide tilt omg I love this game stuck on it
B005LAIH9A|5.0|If you are a fan of American Pie you have to see this movie.  The whole cast reunites (which is so rare these days) and it's funny from the first scene on.  It was so interesting to see what the characters are into these days and having real problems.  American Reunion is about their 12th Class Reunion so everyone comes back for it.  Got out of this movie what I expected to.
B003G4W49C|5.0|This book is good enough to read a second time.  I must have read this book when it was originally released.  I like the author and I enjoyed the story, even though this was the second time I read it.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I already have this app on my iPod Touch and iPhone.  I have a docking station where I listen to these sounds every night to lull me to sleep while I am reading, or if I'm awake, these sounds just relax me.  I was wondering when Relax Melodies would make it to the Android Market and then, I saw a notice that it would happen around May or June.  I secretly hoped that I would be able to obtain the app for my Kindle Fire.<br /><br />What a pleasent surprise, yesterday, when I was searching the app department, decided to type in White Noise and saw this wonderful addition!  SO, I IMMEDIATELY purchased the Premium, and this morning, on my way to work, I was listening to the waves and icy snow while I was reading my Kindle on the crowded, loud bus.  Was able to tune the madness out.<br /><br />I strongly advocate the use of this app.  Free or Premium, it will enhance your Kindle Fire experience.  You can meditate, create an ambiance at your work station, or lull you to sleep.  Either way, it is worth having.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I'm relatively new at reading English language books... and when I do, I usually stick to one author that I love and stick to romantic. I kept reading about Fifty Shades of Grey and decided to read it. I READ THE TRILOGY IN 4 DAYS! I could not put the darn book down. I simply love the story. I cried, laughed, got sad, got pissed off and certainly got turned on by ALL OF IT. I loved the trilogy so much that I read it for the second time within a month. Yes.... I am a Fifty Shades of Grey and E.L. James fanatic... she did an outstanding job with it and I really look forward to her future work.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|The kindle fire app is probably one of the most well made apps I have ever seen for the Kindle Fire or even my Android phone. Keep up the awesome work and innovation Evermore team, and I will remain a loyal customer!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|this game starts out as a easy simple connect the dots but it does not stay simple,  it does not stay easy.  and its addictive.  GREAT mind boggler.  wish it had some type of hints though been stuck on one for 2 days!!!  (:
B001AGXEA6|5.0|How can you not love watching BeetleJuice.  Michael Keaton is at his very very best, and Alec Baldwin is fun to watch in a younger slimmed down early days role.  My favorite is actualy Geena Davis...she is an amazing actress that just controls the screen with her natural abilities and little effort involved.  The Movie is GREAT in Blu-ray...as usual!
B007JM4CWY|5.0|this game is crazy Good. It combine the best of classics strategy games that is absolutely wonderful. the best part is they keep updated with new Puzzles so u never run out of stuff to do
B005HV6Y5W|4.0|I'm a big fan of Terrence Malick - Badlands is one of the finest films ever produced -Days of Heaven is gorgeous and captivating, Thin Red Line is an amazing poem about life with some fine war vignettes thrown in - but even I found Tree of Life excruciating at times. Just end it already! Cut this sequence here! Yet amid that, this is a film that has a huge aspiration, to connect a single human life to everything in the universe, and in some ways it almost succeeds. Though I had issues throughout the film, after it was done it lingered in my mind, affected me. When I look back on it, I edit out the boring parts and appreciate the greatness. It's a film I think everyone should watch, particularly cinephiles, since what separates it from other films that might attempt similar goals is that Malick tries to do it purely cinematically. It's a powerful emotional experience.<br /><br />Do I give Malick some benefit of the doubt that I might not give to another director? Sure, but still, this is some incredible material. The childhood sequence is so real, so perfect, it's hard to describe. I think there's special resonance if you grew up in the midwest but Malick does a wonderful job of butting the carefree up against the difficulties of adulthood.<br /><br />As with other recent Malick works, at times the voiceover can be murky so it's hard to separate character voices, a good sound system helps. Spectacular performance from Jessica Chastain and Brad Pitt deserves more credit than he'll ever get. There's an argument that they're too one-dimensional, but I think there is a lot of subtlety and complexity in the characters.<br /><br />My advice is to plan to take a break in the middle as it is overlength and can wear you down because the excesses are clear. Do that, keep an open mind and let the experience take you over. This is really an extraordinary piece of work, despite its flaws.<br /><br />It's an easy film for people to hate on, but I'm grateful an artist like Malick is taking on a challenge like this.
B005LAIGYQ|5.0|[[ASIN:B0089ZZXX2 Act Of Valor (DVD+Blu-ray+Digital Combo) (Blu-ray)]]<br />Everybody, buy this film!! OK. It doesn't, but even if it sucked these SEALS deserve every dollar and more. So, BUY THIS FILM!!<br />That said, if you enjoy action films, you'll enjoy this one. These are not actors. These are not stunt men. What you see is the real thing. It's staged, but realistically staged. In some scenes there is live fire. These SEALS would not allow any B.S.<br />Guts? These men define the word. I'm speaking about what these men do in the world.<br />So, honor them. Buy and watch this film. It is money well spent.<br />In case you're wondering, I'm not a SEAL. I served in the NAVY. That's all. Believe me, I'm not a wannabe. In my life, I have twice had the honor of knowing a SEAL. And, I do mean HONOR.<br />What are you waiting for? BUY THIS FILM!!
B00846TRHY|4.0|This is by far the best \\"Christian\\" movie I have seen because its real, its about a real person dealing with real things before and after becoming a follower of Jesus. The only reason I gave a 4 star is because the ending does not clearly show where Sam was in his faith.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|really liking all the little games and ways to earn coins. but mostly that it doesn't always have to be connected to wifi.
B0086700CM|4.0|I love this game I sit and play for hours. one thing I don't like is that it takes forever to save up money

1400082773|2.0|Obama is a fake. His real father is Frank Marshall Davis. The birth certificate that he has presented is a blatant forgery. We are all being duped. Please keep an open mind and wake up. The rabbit hole is profoundly deep but only by facing it will we bring ourselves out of darkness.<br /><br />The book may be eloquent and a good read but it is a composite so it would be foolish to take any of it at face value. You have to do a little digging and read between the lines to find the truth on this man. And good luck with that, since he has sealed ALL of his records.
B0086700CM|4.0|This game is really good. Good graphics and works great on my Kindle. Slightly challenging, but a joy to play. Great time killer!

0307472590|5.0|I read both versions English and Spanish and really enjoyed both.  Beautifully written in Spanish.  This is a series of three books.
0345803485|5.0|Very well written. Has a good storyline, keeps your interest. Don't start reading this book unless you have time. Can't put it down. Hope E.L. James writes more.
B005PMNBNG|4.0|I am new to the world of M83 and I found this gem. I have always enjoyed electronica music, from the likes of Sasha & Digweed, BT and Paul Oakenfold, these are the boys of my youth and every now and then I seek them out and try to find something different when I need some workout music or in this case music to rock the house with.<br /><br />I love the freshness that is M83. I found that this music is a perfect harmony of the sounds of today and those of some long lost planet. The fact that the album is called 'Hurry Up We're Dreaming' is a perfect title. I love the 1980's influence as well and the high archs of sounds- the build ups, the crash downs- everything is amazing.<br /><br />'Midnight City' is a song that I listen too as I put my ear buds in and walk the night away. It is the perfect song for those late night outings when you are alone, but the city is with you.<br /><br />Some songs on the album are a bit short and so that is why the 4 instead of 5. I would of liked certain songs to be expanded and built upon.<br /><br />I will be coming back for more M83.

B006BGZJJ4|4.0|The USB cable that came with my Kindle failed, as many others have found out - the plastic covering around the wire flaked off (a known issue). Amazon customer support was great, they promptly agreed to send me a new one. The new cable feels more flexible than the old one, and hopefully Amazon has reformulated the bad plastic.<br /><br />The real story here is not the product fail the first time around, but the great customer support experience I had.
B007K3JCAE|4.0|An enjoyable movie as was the first. It has been mentioned about the digital copy being a network access product. However there is a regular DVD copy included.

1400052181|5.0|Rebecca Skloot has written an amazing, sad, and eye opening non-fiction book that often reads like fiction. Did these things really happen? Yes. Was it fair? No. Never. I felt horrible for Henrietta and her family as I read the book. Yes, her cells have helped science immensely. It doesn't change the fact that they were kept in the dark for years. It's like no one in the medical field cared for these people. It's not surprising that they didn't care since the Lacks were poor and not white. The evident signs of racism and classism in this book are almost too much sometimes. I was really moved by Elsie's treatment. Okay, not moved. More like pissed off.<br /><br />Great books elicit a strong response. I find this to be especially true with The Immortal Life Of Henrietta Lacks. Rebecca Skloot isn't just an amazing scientist for her compassion and empathy; she is also a brilliant writer and storyteller. Like I said, the book often read like fiction. Her research is meticulous but also sensitive to the concerns of the Lacks family, especially Deborah. I can't imagine the pain Deborah experienced. Instead of giving up and calling it quits, Rebecca was resilient and stayed by Deborah, helping her learn about both her mother and sister. I was inspired and amazed by Deborah's strength and courage to learn the truth about the past. In a field that seems extremely driven to just profit and academic success, Rebecca has the heart to care and asks about Henrietta as a person and not just as a vial of cells.<br /><br />I have always loved science so the mentions of cell culture and cell reproduction are very appealing to me. What I like, though, is that Rebecca gives the HeLa cells a human face. It reminds the medical field that Henrietta was a person with a family, with a life of her own. By telling her history, Henrietta gets the recognition that she deserves. To be honest, before I heard about this book, I never heard about Henrietta Lacks. I didn't know about the HeLa cells, either. Why is her story withheld if she had and still has such an impact on not just the medical field but on people's personal lives?<br /><br />I'm so happy I read this book. Even though it was hard to read at times, I have learned so much from it. I highly recommend it to everyone. It's an extremely moving book that held my full attention.either.

B006AZZPCM|2.0|Worked great at first, but after awhile it started cluttering up my Fire with downloaded videos of songs I only wanted the Mp3 for. The videos showed up in the same folder as my music but couldn't be deleted without hooking up to an external computer. VERY inconvient.
030758836X|5.0|This book seemed pretty straight forward in the beginning, however, it keeps you guessing at every turn of the page.  It was a fantastic mystery with extremely complex characters.
B000EDQCC8|5.0|This collection is packaged beautifully and is the best version of the original trilogies. Remastered and Brilliant. The Set arrived in near perfect condition and looks brilliant. It also arrived well before the deadline. The only Warning I have is that the movie soundtrack is stored on a digital track so check to make sure your player can play it otherwise you'll just hear the audio commentary
1416550550|5.0|I have read other books by Kate Morton and I'm not a huge fan.  However, I found this book to be absolutely fantastic.  It is intriguing and the mystery kept me up for hours reading to find out what happens next.
0062213423|5.0|I was VERY pleased with this book. One of my friends told me before I bought it that it was basically all pictures but while it had quite a few very interesting (and sexy) photos, it is also very informative and gives each of the boy's points of view on their lives and their X Factor experience. This is a very good book for any directioner to own.
B008MEM24S|5.0|great fun for perry fans.  i could always use more doof though.  been playing it all day long.  go agent p
B008D1LVRY|5.0|Why?? Just because music doesn't fit your tastes doesn't mean that it is not worthy. These artists make records for people to enjoy, not to have someone tear them down because it wasn't what you wanted!! There are plenty of us whom understand that it takes a lot to make a record and especially one that can go beyond criticism. I udnerstand that everyone has different tastes, but for those of us whom are in it for the enjoyment of heavy music or just for music in general you are wasting your time with crying about how awful someones music is. Try making a disc of your own that can elude these points of view. Meanwhile, for those of us true fans, we love this!!! This disc will kick your face in!! You have the option to preview the tracks. Don't cry cause your girlfriend won't let you play it. Show them how you do it HELLYEAH!!! You naysayers from DFW need to take a STDR!!!
0307593312|4.0|A significant childhood event alters and shapes the lives of a boy and a girl. Delving deep into the lives of these two characters now grown up, Murakami tells his story in alternating chapters by their names; Tengo and Aomame.  We learn about the 2 people who have long since separated from the schoolroom encounter but lead surprisingly similar but parallel lives in 1984 Tokyo.<br /><br />Time and memories, dreams and reality are dominant subjects of the book. Tengo becomes almost suspended in time when sudden flashbacks strike and revert him to an event from his earliest of memories. Aomame extends time when reading Proust's In Search of Lost Time, limiting herself to 20 pages/day. Both thoughtful characters are always searching-for life's meaning and answers to questions : what is real, what is true, what is right. Also always, throughout the years, they think of each other.<br /><br />Unsavory career choices involve both characters with a mysterious cult. This introduces spooky Japanese spirits and goblins, perceivers and receivers, and menacing human villains. Tengo and Aomame both begin simultaneously to sense a disconnect with current reality. Changes, different things that no one else notices make them realize that the world they once occupied had vanished or withdrew and another world came to take its place. The alternate reality is nicknamed 1Q84.<br /><br />For such a thick book, there are few characters, but all are compelling. The 2 main characters are human, relatable and sympathetic. They are attractive and I like them. I found the story of the cult and alternate universe at times to be strained and convoluted, not always satisfying running questions in my mind. This left me feeling unresolved, but thinking a lot after I finished the book. Maybe that was the author's intent. That being said, I found the spirits and the Little People, the Air Chrysalis story and the sinister Ushikawa scary and chilling. What I liked best about this book was the author'srepeated descriptions of the slow, thoughtfulness of nature and mood. For example, Murakami often described the series of physical operations that the human body requires to process an idea or to express a thought before speaking. How a thought may lessen in intensity when spoken out loud. Events in a lifetime 'lose the most important nuances when reduced to words'. It is these kinds of thoughtful passages and the strong character development that allow me to recommend 1Q84.
0345803485|1.0|I picked up this book because, well, everyone else was and I didn't want to be left out. I have only not finished 3 books in my entire life and this is one of them. Let me first state that I am not anti-kink. I used to work at an adult toy store so I am familiar with all sorts of kinky goodness. What disturbs me about this book is the weak female lead character with self esteem issues who is pining over a distant, abusive man. The girl is always surprised to find out the guy has any interest in her at all. When he reveals that he basically wants to use her as his personal slave, she is all too excited to have him tell her when she can eat and sleep and what she should wear. She is not allowed to refuse sex with him and will be punished if she does. Behaving this way for a weekend might be all fun and games but this is no way to have a \\"romantic\\" relationship. Abuse is not romantic, and I'm disgusted that so many women think it is.<br />On a side note, there are many women, including myself, that have experienced relationships like this. When I decided I didn't want to do what the guy wanted me to do I'd get punished. When I tried to end the relationship he threatened to kill me. To all of the women who find this stuff exciting and romantic: you have no idea what you're talking about.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|i use kindle fire. i love this free app. it is easy to navigate, has a wide variety of versions to choose from and easily switch between, and offers bookmarking, highlighting, sharing, and other features. there are reading plans,  and youversion sends you email &quot;badges&quot; that you earn based on your activity, which is cheery (and personally,  it motivates me to keep reading). why pay for one in the bookstore when you can get the same thing free? only inconvenience: you need wifi to use it.
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|I have a cruz micro? tablet, and i downloaded this app and it refuses to work, no matter where it is downloaded from, though this is not the apps fault, cruz tablet owners beware that this does not work.
B006WAIV6M|4.0|I initially had misgivings about reading a 'corporate' kind of book....they usually revolve around a single concept and give hundreds of repetitive examples.<br />But I was very pleasantly surprised and the book held my attention all the way through. It has used data collected from neurological studies about individuals along with psychological studies. Next it has looked at 'keystone habits' of companies and how it can be changed as in the case of Alco. It has looked at societies and how habits drive them. The constant references to ongoing/unpublished studies as well as examples from corporate America like target, alco, toothpaste sales really helped to improve one's understanding of habits in a well rounded way. Even mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther king were invoked as examples.<br />All in all a great read.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|Product was in good shape and excellent price.  No complaints! I appreciate Amazon for having excellent choices and people using it. This is not my first purchase and it won't be my last.

B003O86FMW|4.0|I downloaded this book onto my Kindle after finishing the first book: Hunger Games.  First, to instantly have it after just finishing the first book, was very satisfying.  Again, it is an \\"easy read\\" as it is a young adult novel, but some of the twists the plot takes have been surprises I was not anticipating. Ms. Collins maintains the conflicts that teens often confront without being too graphic with details.  This has been a \\"fun\\" read, and the plot twists have me anticipating the 3rd Hunger Games book, which is now sitting on my counter!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|good variety of games.  majority are doable. but there are a couple that are too sensitive for movement therefore you move your finger fast but the object doesn't move as fast and on some your finger or stylus gets in the way of your view.  but despite those few I'm still playing the others
B008JGSM6G|5.0|even after I've gone through all of the levels I go back and get stumped on levels I aged. this is the most fun game possibly out there as an app. I would regimens his game if you like puzzling games.
143911000X|5.0|Awesome book. 150 bro code articles and lots of those come with extra descriptions, sketches, and other funny stuff. A humourous book but also some pretty good stuff to live by.
0345803485|1.0|A world where this is considered literature is not a world I can be proud to be a part of. An Italian Proverb states: \\"There is no robber worse than a bad book.\\" The world has been robbed by the existence of this book, and I was robbed through the experience of reading it. I would not have continued after the first five pages, except I wanted to talk about how bad it was, and finished it to do so.<br /><br />The prose is stilted. It flows like a river of mud and is grammatically on par with a particularly advanced 7th grader. The dialogue is very formal most of the time, and is unnatural all of the time. The characters are flat cookie cutter people, which might be ok, if they were not both unlikable. The \\"hero\\" is overprotective to the point of being a stalker, and is the most insufferable ass I've ever had the displeasure of reading about. The first-person narrator is a martyr who complains constantly and about everything. She seemed to have all of Bella Swan's less desirable traits (martyrdom, clumsiness, ability to lead on a ridiculous amount of men) and none of her redeeming qualities (selflessness, basic vocabulary.) Throughout the books she refers to her \\"subconscious\\" and her \\"inner goddess\\" (which may or may not be two different entities) as if they speak to her. This was the most annoying part of the book for me. It was as if the character was having to choose between her \\"shameful\\" urges and being herself. The book is supposed to be about sexual freedom (I think) but this woman continued to act more and more trapped as the book continued. Also, the \\"subconscious\\" is an outdated psychology term, which has now been replaced with \\"unconscious,\\" a term that is self-explanatory. All that being said, how does it make sense that this woman is consciously aware of her unconscious?<br /><br />I have seen or heard some complaints about Ana's enthusiasm for sex and apparent talent, despite her inexperience. I am willing to let this slide. As a reader of romance for many years, I would say that this is common, if not the norm. The virginal heroine is introduced to the art of lovemaking by the handsome, experienced hero... and it's awesome. She has orgasm after orgasm and does everything just right on the first try. While this is not realistic, people want to read about great sex. So the characters have great sex. All that being said, I would say that these scenes fell short for me. I found them to be not the worst I had ever read, though they had the same mistakes as the rest of the book. However, it was far from the best. I kept thinking, \\"Ok, people must love this book solely for the sex.\\" Then I got to that part and all I could think about was how many people thought that this was so amazing and sexy. If you want to read great sex scenes, they exist! And not in this book!<br /><br />Overall, this book was very hard to get through. At one point I was laughing at some horrendously awkward and cheesy part, then I felt like crying because there are so many people that think this is a great book. You deserve better! So much better! The only good part about my experience was that I borrowed it to avoid purchasing. Unfortunately, this meant that I had to keep resisting the urge to throw it on the ground and stomp on it.
0525952616|5.0|Kill Decision is startlingly real. And equally plausible.<br /><br />Suited masters of perception playing games with reality while skipping scotch in Crystal City. D.C.'s incestuous relationship between big defense business and... everyone else. Nameless, compartmentalized operators fighting through the night in cesspools loosely labeled as countries. Drones raining from the skies.<br /><br />For those familiar with the constellation of clandestine units, private military contractors, and information warriors that comprise much of America's counter-terrorism capacity, this book will feel very, very real.<br /><br />(If you're not up to speed, I heartily recommend Marc Ambinder's [[ASIN:B0076QVQLI The Command: Deep Inside the President's Secret Army]] as a quick/cheap/quality introduction to that world.)<br /><br />But Kill Decision takes that reality a step forward. In a way that perhaps cements Suarez's position as the best near-future fiction author of the post-9/11 era. He folds in equal parts science, warfare, and informed futurism to take today's sleek drones to their logical conclusion. The results will gnaw on your brain like a swarm of gnats, for weeks after you read the book.<br /><br />This is possible, of course, due in large part to his foundation in John Robb's work (something Suarez graciously mentions in his acknowledgements). Readers of [[ASIN:0470261951 Brave New War: The Next Stage of Terrorism and the End of Globalization]] and the Global Guerrillas blog will find themselves nodding along.<br /><br />Kill Decision is that real, yet, like Suarez's [[ASIN:0857381229 Freedom]] and [[ASIN:B003L1ZXCU Daemon]], it's also a lot of fun. Great action sequences that just scream MAKE A MOVIE. Compelling characters. Quality narrative. It's all in here.<br /><br />Grab it today if you want to see tomorrow.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I love this game but so far only a few levels have been challenging. Hopefully it gets harder as the levels progress.
1616202416|5.0|I have really enjoyed reading Purple Hibiscus by Nigerian born writer Chimamanda Ngozi Adiche. She is an admirer of her compatriot, the writer Chinua Achebe, who wrote, amongst other things, Things fall apart. This might explain why the opening words of Purple Hibiscus are: \\"Things started to fall apart at home...\\" Even if the use of these words is purely coincidental, they provide a very apt summary of what is going to happen during the following 300 pages.<br /><br />The story is narrated by 15 year old Kambili. She and her brother Ja Ja are the children of Eugene, a wealthy industrialist living in the town of Enugu. Their father, who can best be described as a religious fanatic/nutcase, loves them dearly but needs them to conform to his every ambition for them. Thus, coming second in class rather than, is worse than failing completely.<br /><br />The tale begins soon after there has been a coup in Nigeria. Eugene, who edits a newspaper that refuses to kowtow to anyone, employs an editor, whose critical writing attracts the fatal attention of the new regime's hit men. His death does nothing to ease the stress he always imposes on himself, and this in turn causes him to punish his children excessively to the point of causing them serious injury. At times he behaves like a Crusader, defending the faith of his own children by resorting to cruelties, which seem totally incompatible with the parental affection, which he always professes after inflicting a terrible punishment.<br /><br />Aunty Ifeoma, Eugene's widowed sister, lives and teaches at a university in Nsukka. She has three children, is also Christian, but has a far more easy-going approach to religion than her brother. For example, her children are allowed to watch television when the erratic power supply allows, and are also permitted to see, to spend time with, her and Eugene's father, Papa-Nnukwu, who lives in Abba.<br /><br />Eugene and Ifeoma's father is not Christian, and has no desire become one. When,early in the book, Aunty Ifeoma takes Eugene's children to see their grandfather, Kambili and Ja Ja are reluctant to get out of the car to greet him because, as Kambili explains: \\"... Papa-Nnukwu is a pagan.\\" Ifeoma refutes this by saying that he is not a pagan but a \\"...traditionalist.\\" Eugene, who will have nothing to do with his father apart from sending him money, is not pleased that his children have had contact with a pagan.<br /><br />Against his better judgement, Eugene allows his sister to take his children to spend a few days in her home in Nsukka. On this first visit, Kambili and Jaja are like fish out of water in Ifeoma's home. Ifeoma, who is a no nonsense, larger than life, open-hearted person, lives in a crowded book-filled flat - a complete contrast to the orderly home in which Eugene and his family live. Kambili's cousins regard her and her brother as oddities, and the reverse is true. Ja Ja begins to adapt to the new environment, but Kambili, fearing her father's disapproval, fights against adapting.<br /><br />Enter Father Amadi. He is a new member of the chaplaincy of the University of Nsukka, young and attractive. He dresses casually and is a frequent visitor at Aunty Ifeoma's house. When he first meets Eugene's children, and says: \\"Nsukka has its charms\\", Kambili thinks that he has: \\"... a singer's voice, a voice that had the same effect on my ears that Mama working Pears baby oil into my hair had on my scalp.\\" And thus begins her infatuation with a man who has taken the vow of celibacy.<br /><br />Kambili's first visit to Nsukka is brief, but is the first of many for a variety of reasons, which I will not disclose to spoil the book for those intending to read it. The more informal, even though materially more difficult, life in Nsukka provides Kambili with an increasingly more attractive contrast to the rigid, but more affluent, life that she and her brother lead in Enugu. As the political situation impinges more on Eugene's life, the environment and atmosphere in his sister's home in Nsukka becomes increasingly appealing to Kambili, as does the prospect of seeing Father Amadi.<br /><br />Gently and beautifully, Chimamanda Ngozi Adiche describes the downfall of the family both in Enugu and in Nsukka, drawing us gradually towards an extraordinarily tragic ending. In unfolding her story, she introduces the reader to the customs, foods, and many other aspects of Nigerian life without, as so many writers tend to do, making her narrative seem like a series of chapters of a book, which might be titled an \\"Introduction to Nigeria\\".<br /><br />Read The Purple Hibiscus. You won't regret it!

B00846TRHY|3.0|I really enjoyed the movie. It was action packed and a heart-warming story. Then I googled the real \\"machine gun preacher\\". I was saddened to find out that his facility is under investigation for mistreating children. The more I investigated the more it seems like he is nothing more than an arms dealer with a children's orphanage for cover. I was looking for a heartwarming hero story. This is a good one, just happens to be a work of fiction too.
B001UU75WK|5.0|Never heard much about this show when it originally aired but my wife and I love it. It's unique and original which makes it that much better. Not for everyone but give it a try.
B000H4QD1O|5.0|If your looking for, science fiction that wasn't so hokey that you cringed when watching, this is one of the good ones. I enjoyed the characters and the story line. I'm not going to give it all away but just saying it is a great series. I wish someone would pick it back up and do some more with it.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|I love this game! I got most of my family to download this awesome game. Its the best app I've ever downloaded. The only bad throng about it is how addicting this app is! Almost to addicting.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I was intrigued by the main character when I downloaded the sample for my kindle, so I decided to give this a try. Once I saw what was to happen when the two main characters hooked up, I had to stop. It sent me running for the hills!<br /><br />I immediately called Amazon and returned the book within hours of purchasing it.<br /><br />yuck. creepy. horrible. I didn't want to have those images in my head. I had no idea that was what this book would have in it or I would never have attempted to read it.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is pretty fun. most of them are pretty easy.  it is a good time waster if you ever get bored

B008MEM24S|5.0|Where's My Perry is a must-have game for Where's My Water fans and Phineas and Fern fans alike. This game works basically the same as WMW except for a few additions. First of all, the theme. Second of all, under Perry is the addition of a meter that tells how much water has been put into the generator and how much more you need to complete the level. Also, instead of ducks like in WHW, there are lawn gnomes. The gnomes with big, bushy beards have to be collected with steam. One of the biggest additions are Dr. Doofenshmirtz's Inators. The Celebrate-inator sucks up your water or steam and turns it into unusable confettii. The Heatinator turns water into steam. The Freezeinator freezes water. Also, the water pipes that have grates over them only accept steam. The game itself works great. To the people who say that it doesn't download on kindle fire, mine downloaded perfectly fine. I forgot to mention that instead of the Collections items of WHW, there are secret files. There are both Perry and Doofenshmirtz files. The Perry files tell about the other agents of the OWCA (Organization Without a Cool Acronym). The Doofenshmirtz ones tell about his other Inators. When you collect 3 Perry or 3 Doof files, you unlock a special level featuring Doof's pet balloon, Balloony. Also, I have found a secret Swampy themes level. To play it, go to the credits and tap on the duck with a gnome hat. Basically, this is a wonderful puzzle game that is a must-have for anyone.

B00020HCH2|4.0|In spite of the thin sound, this is a good listening experience overall, but these NYPO recordings are clearly surpassed by the early 60's Columbia Symphony Orchestra Brahms cycle.  All four of the CSO stereo performances (from Walter's post heart attack \\"indian summer\\") are definitive, simply the best ever, by anybody.  That also goes for the Haydn Variations and the overtures.<br /><br />If you want the best, get the CSO set (also on CBS/Sony).

B008KNUKVI|3.0|They are one of the best acapella groups around today, and this album showcases the great sound. They make every song seem a million times better than the original recordings.<br /><br />That being said, to be taken seriously as a musical group, they are going to have to write their own acapella songs and not rely so heavily on covers. Look at an acapella group like The House Jacks where they write most of their stuff and do fun covers from time to time. They are famous in the acapella world for their original songs. I'm just waiting for Pentatonix to reach this level.<br /><br />Also, why only 6 songs?

0385342063|4.0|Ms. Kinsella writes another fun chick-lit novel. It has her silly lead female character that makes you laugh and at times cringe. However, I thought she took different directions with this male lead and he was more likeable because he wasn't so perfect but more relatable. There are of course some far-reached ideas in this book at times you think, \\"hmmm not likely to happen.\\" The book reminded me of the movie \\"Pillow Talk\\" but modernized. The idea of anyone \\"sharing\\" any phone line is going to be a good plot, and Ms. Kinsella doesn't disappoint. I still like \\"Twenties Girl\\" the best out of all her books, but I recommend you don't miss \\"I've Got Your Number.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|I urge you to read Cassandra Parkin's reader's guide to Fifty Shades of Grey. I know it isn't really fair to promote someone else's book in a review of this book but if you've read Fifty Shades and just 'don't get the fuss' you will love love love Lighter Shades of Grey. Cassandra is merciless as she picks this thing apart. I absolutely recommend staying away from Fifty Shades of Grey and heading over to check out Lighter Shades Of Grey (a readers guide)
0099579936|3.0|\\"Fifty Shades of Grey\\" I was intrigued to see what all the hype was about. The man lead in the story Mr. Grey doesn't seem like such a catch I'm not sure where the obsession came from, except for all the Twilight fans thinking this is there sex-induced \\"Twilight.\\" To me the writing is mediocre at best, I believe with a little more character development it would have been a much better book. The lead female you try to understand and she is completely all over the place which is maybe where the author wanted to take her but it is so inconstant it is bewildering.  I'll see if I end up reading the next two books.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|I have seen this movie over 10 times now and each time it is awesome!  NPH and Natan Fillion are a wonderful pairing of good vs. evil.  Not to mention this is once catchy sing along.

0767817710|4.0|This gem of a sleeper from Sam Raimi has everything that makes a western entertaining; no-nonesense story-telling, uniquely memorable characters, lots of action, perfect pacing and a satisfying ending. Add a cast of top-notch character actors, a well-defined sense of place and time, imaganitive cinematography and a scinitilating script that doesn't waste a single word, and you have one very-fine film indeed. Gene Hackman gives more than his usual first-rate performance as the sadistic killer who runs the town of Redemption with an iron fist. Russell Crowe is almost unrecognizable as the gunslinger turned pacifist kept as a whipping boy for the bad guys' amusement. But the truly remarkable performance here is from Sharon Stone; controlled, laconic, understated, wholly believable; it's her best turn since the long-suffering mother in \\"The Mighty.\\" Anyone who only knows her from those vapid sex-pot roles in the \\"Basic Instinct\\" movies is in for a huge (and I would hope) very pleasant eye-opening. \\"The Quick and the Dead\\" is now among my favorite contemporary westerns. Highly recommended to fans of the genre!
030758836X|5.0|There are two writers that, in the words of Stephen King, are unsurpassed in their ability to ambush the reader; to lay suspense-ridden traps for you.  They are Ira Levin ([[ASIN:1605981109 Rosemary's Baby]]) and Cornell Woolrich ([[ASIN:0743413164 The Bride Wore Black]]).  To these must be added Gillian Flynn.  \\"Gone Girl\\" has some genuinely stunning surprises embedded in a terrifying story of betrayal and manipulation.  It's a lot like [[ASIN:B0012NO316 Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?]] meets [[ASIN:1455500402 Presumed Innocent]].  I finished it in one long night of reading.  It's just that un-putdownable.

B007I2BZIE|5.0|I had to give this at least a few listens before I Rushed into any judgment myself.I did like it on the first listen but with each additional listen I  am liking it more and more. While I feel lyrics are important in a song for me it's way more about the music. I can relate to much of what Neil relates to as far as the irony of how everything unfolds on this planet and how it could be so much better but folks can take this band and what Neil thinks far from where it was intended to go. All this horse dung about political correctness only depends on which \\"side\\" you feel you yourself fit into really now doesn't it? I have been into RUSH from the time Fly By Night was released and have seen several tours through the years and it's how well these guys play and interact as musicians that appeals the most to me...not the individual politics of the band. Sure Geddy has never been what some  people consider a real singer and constantly whine about that but he never claimed to be what some folks think he should be as a \\"singer\\" ... but the guy is an AMAZING player of incredible ability as are the other two and how they all click is what I myself enjoy. Sure wish people could just enjoy the music and stop with the constant attempt to prove how their ideals are how everyone else should be or else there is something wrong with them. There is everything here...they structure songs in a way only RUSH can and I am looking forward to more listens of Clockwork Angels as time goes by and whatever they do as a band is fine by me..they have surely earned the right to do whatever they want...and always have, which shows you how wonderful music can be without some kind of all wise management thinking they know best telling a band how they  should do things. The pulse of a lot of people just doesn't fit into some ideal mold at all ...another thing this band has proved...I'm with these guys until the end....of whatever.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|I am just now getting to it and can hardly put it down.  I love this and enjoy her thoguhts as she becomes involved with this project.  I worked for a time at the post office at Stehekin which is near the nroth end of the PCT and visited with many who came by and on the trail. I, myself always wanted to experience the Pacific Crest Trail as well as the Applachian Trail  But, being 74, a little late, however I can enjoy this book and pretend it is me. I lose myself in the words and pages.  Thank you for this.  Love it.
B000A6T262|5.0|This is a must for anyone who ever watched and enjoyed the shows or the movies.  Definitely money well spent.
B004W4N55C|2.0|This app works well enough on my Droid RAZR but whenever you try to type on in the search box on a Nexus 7 you get a lovely message box about how the application has stopped working.
B005LAIGWS|1.0|The movie was underwhelming to say the very least.  Not well thought out as a plot, it could have been better written as the original one was. Nothing special.
B000051S3H|4.0|This was the very first version of Jane Eyre that I saw close to thirty years ago. I'd never read the book at that time, and it was seeing this that prompted me to read the book, which I've since read numerous times. But I loved the movie then. It was a genre I was interested in, and I found it to have a hauntingly eerie feel, mainly, I think, due to the music, which contributes greatly to that feeling. Since I hadn't read the book at that time, and since Jane's age isn't specifically mentioned, I didn't know that Susannah York was really too old for the role.<br /><br />In the decades since, I've seen more than one version of this timeless classic. Of the ones I have seen, my favorite and, in my opinion, the best by far, is the 1983 version starring Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clarke. Due to it's length, it is the most faithful to the book. But it also features outstanding performances by both Dalton and Clarke, even though both were much more attractive than the characters in the book are described as being. (I haven't seen Zelah Clarke since, so I can't express an opinion on her current physical appearance, but, let's face it. It would still take a major make-up job to make Timothy Dalton unattractive. The man is gorgeous!)<br /><br />After watching this 1970 version again for the first time since the early to mid-eighties, here are my two main impressions. 1) The music is still one of the movies strongest points. 2) Both George C. Scott and Susannah York gave good performances. What I felt was most lacking was depth of emotion. I keep finding myself comparing to the 1983 version in which Dalton and Clarke both made me feel the heartbreak and despair of their tragic situation. That's what I missed in this version. While I felt their sadness, I did not feel any feelings of sheer, absolute anguish that the later version evokes.<br /><br />After reading quite a few reviews that commented on the poor quality of the DVD as well as some VHS versions, and the fact that some scenes are missing, I opted to order a used VHS copy that was stated to be a former library rental. It arrived promptly and in good shape. I am pleased with the quality. I thought the color was as vibrant as it should be for a VHS that isn't new. Whether or not scenes are missing, I honestly don't know, due to the fact that I hadn't seen it in so long. Overall, in spite of the fact that there are minor deviations from the book, this is still one of the better versions I've seen due to the strong performances of the actors, the beautiful scenery and sets, and, of course, the musical score. I'm happy to have it as a part of my video collection.
0425263908|3.0|I recently read Bared to You by Sylvia Day. It is an erotic romance novel; think Fifty Shades of Grey meets a porno movie. As if Fifty Shades of Grey was PG13, ha!<br /><br />It takes place in New York City where twenty four-year-old marketing assistant Eva and Billionaire lover boy Gideon, meet and instead of having any tact at all he comes straight out and ask Eva if he can f**k her. Maybe not quite like that but he wants to know if she is being banged. Like I said, no prelude to love just a wam-bam-thank you mam type of relationship.<br />But, Eva has a secret that could be unleashed into newspapers at any moment and she is forced to tell Gideon the truth about her life which includes the horrible incident of sexual molestation from her step brother when she was ten years old. Gideon takes the news better than expected but he has a past of his own that he refuses to tell Eva about and when Eva wakes up to him on top of her and straddling her, she knows, that his emotional scars run deeper than hers.<br /><br />I liked this book because it's more fantasy than anything, it's just not realistic to screw in a limo all the time...I mean, wouldn't you get carpet or leather burn? And as emotionally screwed up as they both are I hate the way Eva always submits to Gideon. She doesn't argue with him and they pretty much solve every issue in their relationship with sex. Their personal insecurities are annoying and the sex is the only thing that moves the plot forward...I only say this because I kept reading just to see where the next place would be where they would do it. Sad but true.<br /><br />I liked Fifty Shades of Grey because it had a story line other than sex but it was written poorly. But, this novel was written tastefully well but lacked the emotional connection of the characters. I will be reading the next one in the series that is being released in October called Reflected in You, only to find out what Gideon has hidden in his closet. Other than that, I would give it a 3.5 out of five stars.

0345479092|2.0|This book made the stresses of being a new parent even worse.  Its harsh advice made us feel like we were spoiling our newborn and added guilt each time we snuggled with him or let him nurse a little long.  It went against all other advice and books we read about when to introduce a pacifier or bottle, which confused us and again added stress of \\"who do we listen to?!\\"'.  These methods may work, but there must be a more gentle way...

0739321005|4.0|We all know that Barack Obama has an incredible life story. The surprise here is that he's able to tell it so well. Whether he is talking about his unusual childhood in Hawaii and Indonesia, his challenging community work in Chicago, or his first emotional visit to family in Kenya, Dreams from My Father never falls short of anything but absorbing. Obama is clearly a man who loves to wrestle with words and ideas. He's also straight-talking and honest. Occasionally he's funny. This has got to be among the most surprising and interesting memoirs by a politician I've ever read.

1612183956|4.0|\\"Pines\\" is one of those stories that starts off with great promise -- a man wakes up somewhat injured in an unknown location and things in the nearby town are just a little bit off.... -- where you wonder if it will all hang together in the end, or if it will collapse into a puddle of inconsistency/contradiction/deus ex machina. TV has had its share of these kinds of programs, from the successful (not in ratings) like \\"Nowhere Man\\" to the not-so-successful like a show that aired a couple of seasons ago mid-season but whose title I can't remember anymore.<br /><br />Anyway, in \\"Pines,\\" the man gradually recovers enough of his memory to know that he's Secret Service Agent Ethan Burke, sent to the small town of Wayward Pines to look for two missing colleagues. He was injured in a car accident, and he's missing his ID, gun, wallet, etc. People in the town seem to be skeptical of him. The sheriff is unhelpful. The doctor at the hospital is too busy to see him. He can't reach his wife or his supervisor on the phone. What is going on???<br /><br />This book intentionally evokes the feeling of creepy shows like \\"Twin Peaks,\\" early \\"X-Files\\" and the like. There is a constant feeling of unease, even low-level dread, throughout that's very well done on the part of the author. To answer the question I posed in the beginning, it does hang together reasonably well. It's hard to say anything specific without giving things away, so I won't, but I will note that the story makes more sense on the macro-level than on the micro-level. What I mean by that is that the overarching story works, but if you concentrate on some of the details, it works less well. Still, it's a good read.
B00846REIS|5.0|I kept seeing Amazon recommend this novel based on my prior reading.  I remembered it said \\"a Crossfire Novel\\" and just assumed it was part of an ongoing series, something along the lines of the Babysitters Club for adults - multiple novels with essentially the same plot and a lot of repetitive background info.  Finally I decided to take a chance after reading an article that recommended Bared to You for Shades of Grey fans.  Boy am I glad I did!  I think the characters and their relationship are much better developed and it's simply a better read.<br /><br />Without giving too much away, I will say that instead of writing emails and getting coffee all day, the female lead actually has a career that keeps her busy.  And instead of Eva crying all the time like other female leads, there are real moments of stress relief habits most women won't admit to, but secretly do.  I loved to see that the female character was flawed, recognized that trait in herself, and didn't struggle to see others' flaws either.  Plus there are plenty of very sexy scenes as well!<br /><br />Now I can't wait to read the next one in the series and have already preordered the Kindle version so I can get it as soon as possible!  I'm anxiously awaiting its release date!
B0088XXCZ6|5.0|A big win for imagination and honesty. Everybody should give this album a spin.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game its really fun but on the cheat you earn no pionts that's not fun but love the game
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|the game is real fun the energy doesn't take long to fill and it doesn't take long to load at all an exelant game
0345803493|5.0|I feel like Fifty Shades of Grey is kinda like the movie 9 1/2 Weeks, which i love. It ends the same way, with the woman leaving because the man can't give her what she needs and vice versa... Fifty Shades Darker is like what would happen if she came back, at least this is how i imagine it. This book had a whole lot of hold your breath moments, very exciting. From the ending, it's apparent there will be more drama in Book 3.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I was a little skeptically about getting it at first because of some of the reviews, but I actually really love this app. some of the games are hard, but if If you play that game persistently you will get a 1000 point bonus. if you are really into gaming and like challenging your self to difficult games you should definitely download this app.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|A good app to kill some time with.  A good variety of short simple games.  The ads are no big deal.
0385341008|4.0|The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society invite the reader on witty adventure that celebrates the written word as part of the plot. Less than a year following the end of World War II, popular English writer Juliet Ashton is at a crossroads over subject material and her life. Through the almost lost art of letter writing her story, and that of a band of diverse characters, from Scotland to London and the recently liberated island of Guernsey, unfold. Their joys and triumphs, sorrows and fears, with a common thread of survival based in humor and love, captures the reader's heart and lets the soul remain hopeful under all conditions.
030788743X|2.0|I was disappointed in this book. The reviews made me think it was going to be well-written and entertaining. I found it to be predictable and lacking in creativity. The characters were predictable and thinly drawn. It would be fine as juvenile fiction, I suppose.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|Stunning graphics. Smooth background music. Interesting sound effects. Best of all a ton of panels to play with. I really enjoy this edition.
B005DOKL3E|5.0|An outstanding product especially when compaired with the early Kindles. Easy to read, color, no need for night light. Lots of apps. Excellent response in downloading etc. Great size whe compared to IPAD. Good battery life. Accesses all my original Kindle library.<br />On-line store not as good as same on PC, eg digital pre-order access. Higly recommend getting the Missing Manual book as some things are not obvious ar even explained to the new user. Also they should tell that the old Kindle cord and addapter can be used to charge as well as the one included in the package.<br />Cover OK but needs a poket for ID and small papers, eg airline boarding pass, etc
B004FPZ2G8|2.0|eBook downloaded from Gutenberg. Undervalued by her arrogant baronet father and prideful sisters, meek Anne Elliott's main goal when she sees her jilted ex-fiance is to hide her regret.<br /><br />Not as involving as some of her other tales, with fewer likable characters and a very draggy storyline. I gave up halfway through.
B002LC2DQ4|5.0|It is a very good buy. It is easy to handle in my Olympux camara. This memory card has enough space to save pictures.
B00846REIS|1.0|How can anyone call this unique? Its as if the author has copied 50 Shades, line by line and only changed the names. We get it - so called broken man who's only fault is that he loves his woman too much. Stupid fights over nothing. Sex. Fights. Sex.
B0072OFOM6|5.0|New Season new thrills. My favorite of the 3 so far. Can't wait to order BR from Amazon and can't wait to see the final season.
0143113100|5.0|I am about half way through right now and really love this book! It has been so mind blowing and interesting. I am currently an undergrad studying neuroscience and for a book to read for pleasure this one has been awesome! I've learned so much and it never gets boring. There are so many different incredible stories.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game is extremely fun and generous I would like more Scrat coins and more acorns though. My grandson and I each won 1.700.000 yesterday so fun. I give this a 5 if you want action and excitement this is the one. :)

B004LWZW4W|4.0|Outstanding movie.  I enjoyed all the action sequences. I saw this one on the silver screen and have added to personal collection.<br />Package was damaged.
B0086700CM|5.0|best app ever. l cant beleve its free temple run is worth 1.00 and its probly the most fun app l have.
B007P6VM04|5.0|I cant tell you how much I loved this show and the music that was sung in just the first season! Im so excited for next season!  The only thing that dissapointed me was that some of my favorite songs weren't up their such as the bollywood number and Howl... hopefully they will have them for downloading somewhere!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this app is awesome for killing time while waiting at doctors offices and other spots.  gets a bit tedious to raise points but it is still fun
B0054JZC6E|3.0|this game is okay. too many adds. a little less adds and more game it would be a lot better.
B00846REIS|5.0|Awesome book. Just bummed the sequel doesn't come out till Oct 2012.<br />Don't think I would have read it knowing I would have to wait for the sequel in 3 months. I'll have to re-read again to refresh before the sequel.<br />Resembles Shades of Grey.... I do recommend the book if you liked Shades of Grey.
B007MAETA8|5.0|I can't exactly recall why I purchased this album via my phone and Amazon's MP3 app.  Could have been a good price or maybe the samples convinced me, but I am certainly happy I did!<br /><br />The only way I can explain this album is that it's a great work of heartful song writing.  You can start it from the beginning and sit back, relax, and enjoy the entire album without reaching for the skip button.  It's not very often I come across these types of song collections.<br /><br />When I'm in the car, I like to listen and relax.  It calls for a beer (of course, while at home...not driving), a few friends, and just a good 'ole relaxing time, laughing about days gone by, and the way things were.
0345803507|3.0|Not my cup of  tea so I passed them on to a friend who read all threebof  them from cover to cover.
B005K2XM94|5.0|I ordered this sleeve for my Google Nexus 7, even though it was originally designed for the Kindle Fire. It fits like a glove.<br /><br />As others have commented, the construction is robust. It's a quality Timbuk2 product. I wish it was manufactured in the good ole' USA, but other than that, I'm happy with it.
0930073193|5.0|This book is all the endorsers said it would be. If you read only one thing in your entire life on economics, this is the one. Totally understandable.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|If you want to publish your e-book on Kindle, I have no better recommendation than that you get this book. I am currently using this to format my first novel for publication, and am in the process of formatting my first book (nonfiction) as well. Building Your Book for Kindle has the advantage of being both good, suscinct, and free.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|enjoy the layouts. challenging and enjoy trying to beat my own times. a bargain for the price. nice way to relax.
B007SGM084|5.0|The fact that these 3 books contained alot of sex it also contained a masterful love story. The way the stories continued throughout all 3 books totally could only happen in books, with wishful thinking of it happening in real life. At this point I have read all 3, 2 times and will definately read many more times. The author should feel totally pleased with herself for the way she carried the whole story. She captured my heart with this one. I earnestly hope that the story could continue but will settle for other stories she will write with the same kind of encapture!! Thank you E. L. James, my hats off to you!!!!!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|You will be so hooked and addicted to this game.Let me just say this is a very funnnn game and will not be able to stop playing.. have fun!!!!  (:
B0070NSPCU|5.0|Simply one of the best in a very very long time.<br /><br />I have been reading and collecting fantasy books for over 30 years and have not been this satisfied for a very very long time.
B0086700CM|5.0|I absolutely love this game its very fun and again addicting I cant put the game down. Just becareful on the updated version..
B005VMSBKS|5.0|Sheldon's nemesis, Wil Wheaton, returns in this episode and invites the guys to a party at his house.  When Leonard, Howard, and Raj accept the invitation Sheldon is determined to destroy Wheaton's party.  The Sheldon-Wil Wheaton storyline is one of my favorites!  Sheldon comes up with ridiculous ways to get back at Wheaton but is easily bought with a signed action figure of Wesley Crusher.  As always light and fun!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I enjoy this app. it allows me to read the Bible on the go. I also enjoy the daily reading guide.
0345803493|5.0|First of all, enough with the \\"mommy-porn\\" comments from all the guys who are JEALOUS they could never compare to the likes of Christian Grey. It IS very, very sexual, however, it is a love story for the ages, bottom line! I read all 3 books in less than 3 weeks! A page turner from the start. I would give my left t*t to be respected, loved, honored, cherished, and protected the way Christian was with Anastasia! Guys should read the books just to get an idea of how a woman should and wants to be treated! Although I'm not into the whole S&M thing, the level in which he took things seemed more kinky than serious S&M, so.....with that said, if you're deciding not to read the books because you've heard it's downright dirty, well, ok it's dirty, but like I said in the beginning, IT'S A LOVE STORY!
B0064TVQ5E|1.0|Tried douwnloading the game screwed up my computer and am having a difficult time trying to delete everything that was downloaded. What a mess!!!
0743270754|4.0|I think that Doris Goodwin Kearns did an honorable job with the research and the planning.  I was able to gain a greater appreciation for Lincoln and who he was.<br /><br />I think it painted a great picture of the complexities and delicacies of the circumstances that Lincoln faced.  Not only did he have to tip toe through such a difficult situation, he battled many personal demons too (crazy wife, sick children, dying child)<br /><br />I was disappointed a little bit with the flow of the book.  It had a huge build up for the 1860 convention taking 250 pages to build up to it, going back and forth between the convention activities and the stories of the candidates involved.  Then when it got to the actual voting for the candidates, it was 1.5 pages.  I was feeling a bit short changed there.<br /><br />With all the books on Lincoln, I bet you ask \\"Why should I pick this one?\\"  It gives the best overall picture of the man and his brilliance
B008MEM24S|5.0|Where's my Perry is a fun,  upbeat game that gets you addicted to helping both Perry and Swampy to get there water or their tubes to work.
B006LSZECO|3.0|An interesting plot though I did not find any of the characters especially likeable and no,the ending was not at all satisfying.
B007L3BMGA|2.0|I am ashamed to have got caught up in the hype and to have purchased this. What a load of rubbish - poorly written, very repetitive and about as erotic as a bucket of wart-ridden toads.
B0079R8KO0|2.0|The product could have been nice but the quality was poor.  There were 2 sewing strings hanging off and a nick on the top.  One of clamps that secure the kindle in place does not click in place.  Guess you get what you pay for.
0061726834|5.0|To me, this book was a refreshing concept. The underlying themes were beautiful and really made me think about how this foreign world relates to mine and what a travesty a society without love would be! That is a beautiful thing in a work of YA fiction. READ IT NOW!
B00138EV8U|5.0|The process is easy and the variety is excellent.  Quality is as good as buying the whole CD.  What else can I say?

B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Very easy and convenient app. Good learning tool for my kids too! I homeschool and can use it for teaching money.
B001GKJ2DO|5.0|DVD arrived in very timely manner - The film itself (Mamma Mia) is a great movie to watch if you're feeling blue, or just want to watch something for fun. Not to be taken too seriously of course, beautiful scenery, terrific acting,fabulous music.
B004W4N55C|1.0|does not work on tablets, or android 4.1, nexus 7<br />please update this soon! I depend on this app to play my music on guitar! let us know when an update is coming.
B004EPYZV2|5.0|I own all the other MI movies on DVD, and will soon buy a Blu-ray box set here on Amazon. This movie rocks! I loved Simon Pegg, who reprises his charming, funny role as the immensely loyal friend and techno-geek - but this time with field agent cred.<br /><br />Tom Cruise once again kicks ass, in an intense yet likeable role where we can relate to his character. You feel the anxiety, you cheer him on when he's hurt and just won't give up. You can't help but cheer for the good guys in this one.<br /><br />The intro is kick ass, worthy of any Bond movie.<br /><br />The audio and video quality are amazing. I am using a Panasonic BDT320 and Turtle Beach PX5 7.1 surround sound headphones, bought here on Amazon, to play the movie. Suffice it to say it is a first class experience, and worth owning. Sadly I missed it in theaters, but I can enjoy it in full on my own time here at home. No, I didn't buy my Viera plasma on Amazon ;)<br /><br />***** 5/5 stars<br /><br />My only gripe is the Paramount Ultraviolet service. It's a confusing setup, having to create and then link 2 separate accounts and then download the movie using a poor interface.<br />Also, reduced movie quality aside for the download, the movie is currently stored on my hard drive (Windows 7 PC) in 7972 separate files in the folder \\"Videos\Paramount\da4ffc18-ae64-482d-aaf9-edf1b1c21753\\". All the files have names like \\"0a3cb982-3051-4dd5-8ad8-392837e04da4\\"<br /><br />WTF?<br /><br />How about an MP4 or WMV file?<br /><br />What if I wanted to take it with me on my tablet?<br /><br />Awesome movie! Worth getting. I paid under $20 for both the Blu-ray and DVD versions. If you love adrenaline, James Bond, Jason Bourne and intelligent action, you'll love this one.
B00475AYJQ|2.0|The book itself was gripping, told with the same fluid style of the first in the series, but I was put off when, for the last third of the book, it became a teenager having sexual romps with whomever. Perhaps I'm just old fashioned, but it seemed to me that the story was pretty much over, so he stretched it out with unimportant sexual themes that i'm not sure will, or should, be important in the following book.  If this book is going to be confined to one trilogy, then the author, I'm afraid, is selling his own potentially well-developed plot short. There are many more story lines he should have developed.  He needs to study up on how Brandon Sansderson develops and organizes a plot.
B008MEM24S|5.0|This is a must buy. For anyone who loved Where's My Water you will be pleasantly surprised. Plenty of levels for you to solve.
B001684L0A|4.0|For the most part it was done well.  As with most movies these days, it has a lot of leftist twist and injections that take away from the historical values that otherwise would be important.
B004UHL9EK|5.0|I cannot attest to some of the other reviewed comments abt this app not working on the Kindle Fire. Perhaps they had an earlier version. I got mine around the June 2012 timeframe if you want a time stamp and this app works great for me. I use it as an alarm clock, minder for taking medication, and for the kids (ie sharing timer and potty timer). I've customized ringtones using my music and the App has never crashed on me. It more thsn exceeded my expectations.<br /><br />P.S. Having worked in IT, especially in relation to laptops, one reason for crashes is always been the lack of available memory. If Apps are crashing often, then perhsps you should check available space for Apps and for on device memory. If you have less than abt 15% of space available in either then you may not be leaving your device enough room to read/write and maintain error free functionality. So use the cloud to de-install a few of your memory hogging game apps (they'll be available in the cloud) and simply re-indtall them when needed. I know we all like to load our devices up, but all devices snd even people need space and operating room to function well.
B005SCSL56|5.0|I'm only about 4 chapters in, but already I'm hooked. It reads easily and is enjoyable even for adults (I'm well past my teenaged years.) I can't wait to find out how Alex and Conner fare in The Land of Stories and how they'll get home. Not to mention, I'm still waiting for the Evil Queen to tell her side of the story.<br /><br />The audiobook is particularly enjoyable. The author has a soothing voice and imbues the characters with emotion.

B007IXWL2C|1.0|If you haven't already started this trilogy, be sure to read all the one-star reviews carefully, since they are both accurate and entertaining. If you insist on following the herd, know that the plot never really goes anywhere, the repetitive writing becomes exhausting, and the plagiarism of another author's characters is quite evident. The editing is laughable too. This line appears in the second book: \\"I wiped my hand across the back of my mouth.\\" Show us how that is done, Ana. A literary disaster.

B007SGM084|1.0|Other than the books being poorly written, there are a host of other issues with this series.<br /><br />1) Other than having \\"book\\" knowledge of BDSM, it's obvious she has no experience in the life style, and no knowledge of fetishism.  One does not become a Dom or Sub because of your childhood horrors. If that were true, we would all see BDSM as vanilla.<br /><br />2) I skipped page after page of sex.  Characters were boring and mediocre at best.  How many ways can a couple have intercourse?<br /><br />3) Christian is emasculated by the end of the 3rd book.  He is a strong person/personality and she turns him into a limp fish by the end.<br /><br />4) I continued reading because people kept saying book 2 gets good, book 3 gets good... Never really saw the \\"good\\" stuff.<br /><br />5) Chapters, scenes and pages ran on in weird ways.  They are at a party with a room full of people and then he's taking off his shirt.  I had to go back, several times, to see if I skipped a page or something.<br /><br />Overall, not worth the time/money that I spend on reading them.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I love this app! I downloaded it because I have trouble figuring out this kind of game &amp; want to challenge my mind!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I read this series before it got popular.  While the mention of the \\"inner goddess\\" does get quite annoying, I did quite enjoy this series.  A LOT.  I highly recommend them to anyone who's looking for a great series to read that will have you turning the pages and devouring a book fast.<br /><br />I'm seeing a lot of people comparing this series to Twilight which cracks me up.  Supposedly this was once Twilight fan fiction, but I'm not sure how much I really believe that.  And if it was, so be it.  When I read them, Twilight NEVER once entered my mind.  It's pretty ludicrous that so many people have to always compare everything to that stupid series!!  Seriously annoying.  Like Stephenie Meyer was the first one to have a book set in the Pacific Northwest.  Ugh!<br /><br />Anyway.  I will say that I was totally SHOCKED to see so many 1 star reviews.  Really?  Ridiculous.<br /><br />Read these books!  They're excellent.

B0088TG252|3.0|Either a major coincidence has occurred every time Denzel was cast for his last 20-something movies where each director successively said to him, \\"Could you just play the same character you played in your last movie?\\" or Denzel has just found a character comfort zone that he knows the audience will love every time. And indeed the Denzel character works. The last time I saw Denzel not playing the same character that he was playing in Safe House was all the way back in 1992's Malcolm X (he played Malcolm X).<br /><br />But still...I was certainly entertained by Safe House. As the story goes, Ryan Reynolds is a green CIA agent house-sitting an empty CIA Safe House in South Africa. But the Safe House isn't empty for long; some agents show up with Denzel in tow as their prisoner, and the action begins when powerful forces show up to make sure that the Safe House is the last place that Denzel ever sees.<br /><br />All in all, Safe House was a good movie. In a predictable, redundant Hollywood portrayal, the CIA brass are either crooked or idiots. And the movie seemed to run a bit long at almost a full 2 hours. But Safe House is definitely a thriller worthy of your rental queue...at minimum check it out when it comes out on cable or satellite.

B0051MKMNC|1.0|Just rented this from Netflix and was forced to sit through umpteen commercials for their other pathetic films ... from last year no less~!  Do the studios really believe this is a good way to sell their products?!  Suffice it to say, that I did NOT view this film, just sent it back to Netflix.  I will avoid 20th Century Fox films as often as possible as I do with their television programs.

030758836X|5.0|Very compelling story. The plot's twists and turns were unpredictable-like a rollercoaster!  Well written with believable characters. This book would make a great movie... a more cleverly constructed tale than War of the Roses.
B006RUJST6|4.0|Clean romance, the sequel is a good book as well. (Point of Retreat) Both books are very creative, implementing lyrics from a band into the story.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I didn't expect the twist and turns this book would take.  An enjoyable and surprising novel but I thought the ending was a little weak.

B0088RQ4X4|3.0|I won't go into detail here, just a few bullet points:<br />- The film didn't deserve the awful critiques it received. At worst, it's very good popcorn cinema.<br />- Many of ERB's ideas and images were faithfully reproduced. The \\"Red Martians\\" were done very well, and the computer animations are flawless.<br />- The makers fell victim to the urge to turn JC into an action film. Sometimes I thought it was a remake of Star Wars I.<br />- The makers also failed to realize that the true wonder of film like this (and the books) is discovering all of the amazing things Barsoomian culture offers. These were dealt with only in passing.<br />- Lastly, while I concede that we're living in the 21st century, Dejah Thoris as Xena-the-warrior-princess cum President-of-the-Helium-Academy-of-Science was just a little hard to take.<br /><br />So, there you have it: 3 stars for stunning imagery and fair-to-moderate faithfulness to the original. Points subtracted for tendentiousness and triviality! What really bugs me is that the film couls have been so much better so easy! Now the film has failed, no franchise will ensue. The project is dead for another generation!

B0050R0XEG|5.0|One of the best things about product licensing is that the more off-the-wall, unexpected, or intricate the product is, the better the license will seem. Volkswagen has done very well to give Lego the official license to a couple of their products, and this VW van takes the creative license all the way. The finished Volkswagen T1 Camper Van is incredibly detailed, fun to build, and looks gorgeous when it's done.<br /><br />I really can't say enough about the detail here. This is not just a scale-model reproduction that is created from perfectly miniaturized, custom molded plastic, like your traditional model car. This bus is made from regular Lego bricks! There were only a couple parts here that I hadn't seen before. What makes this model so amazing is that the 1300+ regular bricks come together before your eyes to form an amazingly detailed classic bus.<br /><br />There's a lava lamp, a sink with storage underneath, a mirrored closet door, a tiny plant next to the bed. You've got gas and brake pedals, curtains (special to the set), and a tailpipe. And moving parts galore: four doors, a back hatch, two windows, the pop-up camper top, three seats (and one folds down into a bed!), and the engine lid. Speaking of the engine, from the flywheel to the alternator, it's all in there.<br /><br />Others have commented on the stickers. Yes, printed bricks would have been far better, but unlike other Lego models I have seen, each sticker goes on its own brick, so you can tear it apart with no trouble.<br /><br />I got this as an anniversary gift for my wife. She finished it in about nine hours, so there is plenty of fun for the money. It will be a great display and conversation piece! If you have never spent the money on a big set, go ahead and get this one - you won't regret it. If you love Lego or Volkswagen, this is a perfect product licensing marriage.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I have never read anything like these books before but absolutely loved them.  Hard to put down, read one after the other of the trilogy.
B007WFR1MQ|4.0|There are very few pieces of art that could be summed up in a single sentence. Fear Factory's latest offering, \\"The Industrialist\\" just happens to be one of those pieces. Put simply: If you loved Fear Factory's classic fare (namely \\"Demanufacture\\" & \\"Obsolete\\"), you'll love this album just the same. To write the album off that simply would be unfair though, as co-conspirators Burton C. Bell (vocals) and Dino Cazares (guitars/burritos) worked hard with their new drummer, an apparent cybernetic organism that goes by the name of Drum Machine to ensure that you, the consumer, got only the finest Fear Factory product possible.<br /><br />A mere ten tracks deep (nine if you discount the lazily titled interlude \\"Religion is Flawed Because...\\" and eight if you write off the ambient and lengthy \\"Human Augmentation\\"), Burt and Dino waste no time in bringing more of Fear Factory's sweet industrial-metal goodness to the masses (playing at a Gathering Of The Juggalos near you this summer!). Being that the effort was self-made and produced with a skeleton crew, it shouldn't come as a surprise that what \\"The Industrialist\\" lacks in innovation it more than makes up for in immediacy. From the get-go, \\"The<br />Industrialist\\" pretty much lays waste to all in its path. The title track is the sort of epic along the lines of \\"Zero Signal\\" that every Fear Factory fan craves. Likewise, \\"Recharger\\" is classic Fear Factory, with Cazares stepping out of the box a bit and expanding on the Fear Factory guitar-sound (a sound that has remained rather consistent regardless of who was slinging the axe way back when). Through the thick of it, \\"The Industrialist\\" doesn't let up in its intensity, up to the 11th hour gem, \\"Disassemble.\\" By the time the ambient fluff kicks in, it's an aural relief and like a rollercoaster ride, you can't believe it's over so quick.<br /><br />Unfortunately, \\"The Industrialist\\" isn't as perfect a mimicry of Fear Factory's glory days as 2010's \\"Mechanize\\" was. The drum-machine is noticeably lifeless at points, giving the title \\"Soul of a New Machine\\" an ironic new twist. Also, the theme running through the album of Man Vs. Machine is pretty tired and contrived at this point. In the past, the band's affection for \\"The Terminator\\" was fresh and worked in their favor; in 2012, it's run its course. Of course, the bottom line is that if you forget that Fear Factory circa 2012 is essentially two unlikeable dudes and a robot kicking out the jams, you'll love \\"The Industrialist.\\" And there's really not much else to say about that.achine is noticeably lifeless at points, giving the title \\"Soul of a New Machine\\" an ironic new twist.

B007J4T2G8|2.0|I finished this book only because I thought it might get better.  I really don't understand what all the hype is about.  I did not find it erotic or romantic in the least.  It seemed a little adolescent in nature and content.  I won't be reading the 2nd and 3rd books.  If you are looking for depth and romance...keep looking.

0451196716|5.0|The Long Walk is simply amazing. It's Stephen King at his ultimate best. Thrilling and morbidly dark, the tale sucks the reader right in and never lets go. It provokes \\"that can't put it down\\" feeling on steroids. Really, books like this remind me how much I love reading. It's genre fiction as high art. After indulging The Hunger Games and Battle Royale, I was on a real teenagers death march in a dystopian vibe and The Long Walk delivered the perfect fix. I can't recommend it more. I've read a lot of Stephen King and, so far, this was my favorite.

0345803493|3.0|I bought the book just shortly after purchasing and reading Fifty Shades of Grey.  I wanted to know more about the FICTIONAL character, Mr. Grey himself.  I was not disappointed in the story at all, in fact it got better and better until I read the very last page.  So the pissed off Jack is going to take his vengence somehow and ruin their fifty love life I suppose....haven't read that one yet.  But I will buy it and read it.<br /><br />The reason I am compelled to leave a review about this particular book is because it in fact was the best so far....loved reading about Elena getting her face slapped by Christian's mother (SPOILER ALERT, right, but in a good way.)<br /><br />Now, if EL James could narrow down the email pages so they are compact, and stop with all the excessive descriptions...(We get it E, Christian's looks are way overrated, we know he's hot and rich in the first book)...then the THREE books could have possibly been a great novel about BDSM all in one and how one copes to over come the demons of his past...or something like that...<br /><br />I totally get it all and hope to enjoy reading the 3rd book with the hopes that hollywood won't stretch this one out and let it all fall into one movie because the time period doesn't stretch out past a month or so, right?  But most women and men that have read this book find it almost vanilla because they go much futher with BDSM and some women and men only need a little kink with their vanilla sex...but nobody wants their ass beat with a belt...come on! Oh, that was in the first book in the last chapter, right?<br /><br />However, I laughed during most of the scenes until I read the one on the morning in the red room on his birthday...now that was hot...but who hasn't tried that but a bunch of tight arses, right?  LOL<br /><br />So to end my review, laughing, I say, buy this one and read it, you won't be disappointed...peace out.

B001FB55HQ|3.0|This movie is good. People are complaining it wasn't R rated and Schwarzenegger wasn't in it and so on. I thought it paid more respect to the franchise than the silly part 3. This was well acted and did a good job of showing the results of the needless part 3. The first two terminator movies are the classics in the series and honestly it should've ended after 2. But you know Hollywood. Nevertheless I enjoyed this film and nostalgia won't cloud my view on that. I heard Arnold hated this but liked part 3. Ah no. Much love but 3 was a joke in my opinion. One thing I wish is that Chris Nolan helped do the marketing with this because: why in the world would you give away that Marcus was a terminator before the movie was released? That was stupidity and it took away from the film's impact. All in all I was entertained. But they need to end this franchise because the story is going to get more absurd and convoluted.
B000VOC90Y|5.0|This the first bag I truly like a LOT in 5+ years. I've had several bags but kept an old APC since it was my favorite . It was just in shreds and I had to find a new one and this is quickly becoming my new favorite. I like the many pockets, zipper storage area's, plenty of file and PC storage.<br />My only wish would be a horizontal pen/pencil holder.<br />Seems very strong and it feels good on the shoulder even after a long walk from place to place.
B007N31ZLA|5.0|Great Movie<br />I just saw this movie for fifth time, each time is the best movie. I saw it for first time at the theater with my parents (this was my second adult movie), one time at TV and three times with DVD. I will replace my DVD with BD as soon as possible.<br />Each time is different, first was the surprise, second (many years later), the refresh, third the plot and the music, and now I really could appreciate all the beauty of this movie, the costumes when people dress with class, all the details for time and place, and the real good performance. This movies deserves all the prices that won and a little more.<br />A master piece that need to be seen and enjoyed

0307742997|3.0|(3.5 stars). The Snowman is a gritty, dark and well crafted thriller with a terrifying finale - containing enough twists and turns to keep you guessing right until the end. As with most Scandinavian crime thrillers I have read, this book is brutally honest and not for the faint hearted. I had the audio version of this novel and it surely kept me on the edge of my (car) seat driving to and from work, especially at night (when I was glad to be in Australia and there was no chance of anyone having built a snowman on my lawn whilst I was away).<br /><br />Harry Hole (which is pronounced \\"Hoola\\" in the audio version) is a no-nonsense detective with enough demons of his own to make him an interesting and believable character. Confronted with Norway's first serial killer he must work against the clock to save women from falling prey to the \\"Snowman\\", a sadistical murderer who leaves a snowman as his calling card after killing. And the author does not hold back with information about the warped and twisted mind of the person Harry is chasing, describing in every detail the workings of his sick mind reflected in the grisly murders, which at times made my skin crawl. With suspects changing throughout the novel as more information comes to light and sinister secrets are revealed, I admit I was on the wrong track for most of the novel, so the author did a great job keeping up the suspense.<br /><br />This was the first novel in the Harry Hole series I have read. Although I found the Scandinavian names a bit tricky to keep track of in the beginning (especially listening to the story), I had no trouble filling in the blanks of Harry's history from the references contained in the novel. However, I am now planning to read the earlier books in the series to try and get a better insight into the character of Harry Hole (and be terrified all over again).<br /><br />I can fully recommend this book to anyone who likes to be scared out of their wits by a well-crafted, terrifying thriller. Just don't read it home alone, especially if it's snowing outside!. Just don't read it home alone, especially if it's snowing outside!
B007K3JFUQ|5.0|I loved the first Sherlock Holmes and thought both Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law did an amazing job portraying their characters. The second movie completely lived up to my expectations. It's a little slow starting, but has amazing twist and is an all around great movie and totally worth a watch!
0307594777|5.0|I loved this series! It took a bit to get into but if you think it's starting slow, stick with it. At the beginning, there is a lot of background but it will pick up and before you know it, you won't want to put it down.<br /><br />This series has a very intricate plot and you need to pay attention to what you are reading as there is just allot going on.<br /><br />I love the character Lsbeth. She is victimized thought the book but she is tough as nails and doesn't play the victim  roll.<br /><br />The plot line of this series deals in quite a bit of detail regarding sex crimes, rape and trafficking and can get explicit. But it all ties in and flows excellently. There are rape scenes but no \\"aww, that poor victim\\" angle.
B008ASLK8A|5.0|This interpretation of Sherlock Holmes is beautifully made.  The characterization of Holmes is not as reserved and witty, perhaps, as that of the original Holmes, but this Holmes is fascinating and engaging; in addition, Downey manages to imbue the character with unexpected suggestions of tragic depth and moral insight.<br /><br />Above all, the movie is comedic, not tragic, and the writers and actors never lose sight of that fact.  The writing and acting are pitch-perfect throughout the tightly woven plot.<br /><br />I especially like the fact that the writers and actors retain the moral center of an Arthur Conan Doyle story -- the passionate concern for the victim and the fierce devotion to unmasking the concealed, murderous criminal.<br /><br />The final scenes with Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Moriarty at the Reichenbach (sp?) Falls are presented beautifully.  The ominous Falls are as terrible as we had imagined them to be.  The actors are impressive and mesmerizing.  Downey, especially, \\"steps outside of himself\\" to occupy the moment brilliantly as the great detective face-to-face with his sinister, inimitable foe, so aptly described as \\"morally insane.\\"<br /><br />Jude Law is superb in his faultless interpretation of Watson.  He is a fine, fine actor.<br /><br />The music is stunning.<br /><br />Anything not to like? I thought that the \\"semi-nude\\" scene in Mycroft's study was somewhat disturbing; I can't imagine a Victorian gentleman -- even Mycroft -- appearing in such a way.  The actor who played Mycroft, however, did a good job with the rather strange episode.<br /><br />Similarly, the dance scene between Holmes and Watson was too implausible to accept, even with the duo's frequently witty antics in prior scenes.<br /><br />However, those unusual scenes were so well acted that one cannot fault \\"the players,\\" who entertain us so well in this memorable, exquisite adaptation of the Conan Doyle classic.
0345803485|5.0|I personally loved the book for the story line.  I am a book worm & love anything from 12th Century Scottish Highlander novels to modern day romance.  I do not understand why this is considered erotic.  To me it has just the same amount of sex as every other romance novel.  I have read erotic but this is not what I would consider erotic, ROMANCE!<br /><br />Erotic is all about hardcore sex, throughout the whole book.<br /><br />I have recommended this book to others but have also given them list of books the can read that are romance, same amount of sex but great story line.

0142405809|5.0|We love Julia Donaldson's books. Her stories are fantastic, and her rhyming flows so smoothly. Very easy to read aloud to the kids. This story in particular is one of my favorites because of how poetically everything is described. We'll be collecting all of her books!
B007JNR4WI|5.0|George O'Malley is struck by a ball of light and taps into hidden powers and abilities within his mind. The government wants to poke and prod, study and dissect George, but George just wants to go back to his simple life in small town America.  John Travolta and Robert Duvall are simply spectacular.
B00447L4KA|5.0|Had this on VHS wanted it on DVD. This movie was actually cheaper here then finding it in the store. Has some great people and good acting. Like this movie way better then the TV show.
B005S9EK1S|3.0|When I heard about the movie \\"The Lucky One,\\" what interested me most was the director's name: Scott Hicks, director of \\"Shine,\\" a biopic of David Helfgott played by Geoffrey Rush, who won the Oscar. Since the 1996 film, Mr. Hicks has made such films as \\"Snow Falling on Cedars,\\" \\"Hearts in Atlantis,\\" \\"No Reservations,\\" and \\"The Boys are Back.\\" They are all good, if not as great as the bio-pic of the pianist.<br /><br />And now comes \\"The Lucky One,\\" a romantic movie starring Zac Efron, and based on a Nicholas Sparks novel. The story is about a U.S. Marine Logan Thibault (Zac Efron) serving in Iraq, who finds a photo of a woman, half-buried in the dirt. As it turns out, the photo saves his life.<br /><br />A few months later Logan comes back to Colorado, but soon starts looking for the woman of the photo. He travels to Louisiana, where he finds his \\"guardian angel\\" Beth Clayton (Taylor Schilling), a dog kennel owner for whom Logan starts working.<br /><br />The two leads Zac Efron and Taylor Schilling deliver solid acting, and so does the supporting cast including Blythe Danner as Beth's grandmother, and Jay R. Ferguson as Beth's divorced husband. Like other films based on Sparks' novels, no one is basically \\"bad\\" - as Efron's hero says in a certain scene - and I like the film for that.<br /><br />What I didn't like about the film is the uneven pace of the film: Logan's quest for the identity of the woman of the photo that ends so fast, and his walk from Colorado to Louisiana (changed from the original's North Caroline) that ends even faster. The romance of Logan and Beth is not bad, just contrived (at their first meeting, Logan is not given a chance to tell Beth why he came all the way from Colorado). The melodramatic turn of events at the climax (involving Beth's son Ben and one tree house) is too sudden and predictable.<br /><br />Scott Hicks did much better in \\"Snow Falling on Cedars,\\" where he didn't have to rely on musical montage to make the film emotional..Inshort, \\"The Lucky One\\" is a well-acted, beautifully-shot romance with two likable leads, but nothing particularly original about it.
B002P7UCMC|5.0|This album is Awesome, I can't stop listening to it. Its just that good. The CDs came right on time and everything with the shipment was great!
B007VUCAVO|3.0|Don't get me wrong, I love this app but there just isn't a point to pay $2.00 for it when it does pretty much everything the free version does. Just get the free one, buy a lollipop and it would be the same except you get a snack too. Have fun :)
B003O86FMW|5.0|This was, in my opinion, the best of the three books in the Hunger Games trilogy - not that I don't love all of them, of course, but the second one is great because we feel established with the characters, and the new ones that come in are far more colourful than those in the previous. The first half is a bit difficult to get through (it's slow at times), but the second half - and the design of the arena - is brilliant!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Amazing app, tells me exactly how much battery I have left listening to music, watching a movie, or surfing the web. GET THIS APP!!!!!!!!!!!!
B004UC4HCG|5.0|It has been a few months since building my latest Shuttle cube and the operation of the SH76H3 has been flawless. The primary use for this cube is as a media server for a home network. It is ultra quiet; if it were not for the front LED lights I wouldn't be able determine if it were running or not. My configuration is: Intel i5 Quad Core, Corsair 16G RAM, Intel 120G SSD, Seagate 1.5T HDD, ASUS DVD, Internal Flash Memory Reader and Win7 64bit. This is my second Shuttle barebones cube assembly and both have been easy, painless installations. I will continue to build Shuttle cubes for my personal use as long as the product quality remains on this level. Based on my experience, I would recommend Shuttle to any custom system builder.

B008MEM24S|2.0|u know how I have to have 40 gnomes to unlock mission 2 well I keep getting gnomes but it will not show it on the screen help
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It is extremely easy to use. I Love the way you can add the percentage without having ti figure it out and then adding it to the original #. Best of all tho - for me- goes right along with a main reason I like my Kindle Fire itself -- I can actually see the #s. It's free, but it eojkd be worth paying $$$ for.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|I would play it but I don't have money on my account but I watched my little brother play it it was awesome BTW why doesn't spider-man ever have a six pack plz add that lol
1401235417|4.0|There are other nocturnal winged animal-men in Gotham city and Batman must confront them.  This is an exciting collection of an ongoing storyline.  This book takes us -- I assume -- half-way through.  Can't wait to read the next one!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This game is really fun but it is way to easy. My friends had a hard time with it. Like I said its really fun but easy. I would get it if you like puzzles
0375842209|3.0|I love that this novel did not focus on the Jewish people, but rather the German people and a child at that.  But, the death narrator bothered me a lot as my mind began to wander about him ... like,  if he's death why does he have to physically climb through windows, why is he telling me the ending, why is Leisel so special that he chose her to write about, etc.  He also seemed to put distance between me as reader and the main characters.  The result was that I felt little for these characters, interesting as they were.  It was very well-written and had a great plot, but Mr. Death ruined it for me.
B001DCQI8W|5.0|I am very impressed by the fast service and great price by blowitoutahere. Many thanks for providing hours of music listening.  I will definitely use this vendor again.
B006OCM0G0|4.0|It said it in my title, I literally fell in love with this app. The only flaw is I do wish gems were cheaper and easier to get. Buy this app. What I recommend is spend gems more slowly.

B00846REIS|5.0|Bared To You had a lot of similarities to Fifty Shades... a whole lot, but I liked it just as much. Possibly more. To me Eva and Gideon were more real. They both have issues and they've both had rocky lives. Their lives just eemed more real. I liked the flow & the way the story was written. It was intense and extreme, but great! I will be anxiously waiting for the next book in the series. I really hope Sylvia Day will create more than three books with Eva and Gideon. She create so much story that she can easily do so! [...]
B004LWZWGA|5.0|The Dark Knight Rises was absolutely amazing, brutally epic, PERFECT ending to the trilogy, the first perfect trilogy! It wrapped all the plots from the first two films. Everyone was terrific in it, Bale was great as usual, Hardy as Bane was a monster and even Anne Hathaway was great as Catwoman. Michael Caine was so emotional as Alfred, I want to give him a hug. There's so much I want to talk about it, but I won't spoil it. There were a couple of things I'm really happy that it DID happen. You HAVE to see it in the theater. I'm going again in a few days.
B007XKEY6Q|2.0|Amazon is now TWO updates behind. What gives? This version is getting close to incompatible with other players. Friends keeps losing bombs on me for no reason.
B008MEM24S|4.0|I love this app but it took a long time to get. I would rate it 5 stars for the game... 0 stars for wait time.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|Little or No Spoilers (Let me know if you see otherwise)<br /><br />This movie, despite being waited for and anticipated for over a year, has managed to exceed my expectations. It will be really hard to explain how great the film is without spoiling one or two of the surprises so if the review seems incomplete, you might want to see the film; it is most definitely worth seeing. The third and likely final installment in Nolan's Batman film series focuses more on Batman and his lifelong struggles than anything else. From the beginning of Batman Begins, Batman has been struggling to find himself as a person due to the loss of his parents and strong desire to find justice when no justice seems possible. That is why the Batman/Bruce Wayne in this third movie struggles to live when being Batman is nearly impossible due to age and Gotham only reminds him of the loss of his family and Rachel. The movie is heavily grounded in action and the movie is paced so that we get occasional action throughout followed by a long and intense battle sequence at the end. The action is exceptionally paced and executed, keeping you so gripped that you easily let the film grab your entire attention and move you wherever it pleases. The acting is what you would expect from so many high quality actors: nothing short of fantastic. The story starts slow, but moves more quickly as the time wears on, but never falters or misses a spot to shine; the script and storyline are truly as good as Nolan said it would be. I don't feel like I can critique much further without spoiling something so I will leave you with this: the movie definitely goes all the way back to complete the entire trilogy and gives a true sense of closure for the legacy of Batman. This may be one of the best, if not the greatest superhero franchise of all-time.<br /><br />Overall Rating: 4.85 stars
B002MQYOFW|5.0|this book is so totally amazing! i mean, after 2 WORDS i was hooked! its so sad how rue dies, tho. o well. at least peeta made it thru. he has a dum name tho. it sounds like pita as in the bread, and hes a bakers son. :^)!!!!!!!!! go team gale! i dont care that &#34;pita&#34; married katniss in mokingjay. go team gale! ;)
B007Q476KU|5.0|Wow we enjoyed this movie very much.<br />I will order one in blu-ray for our collection.<br />Great Film For The Whole Family PG 13
B003YL4LYI|5.0|One of the best books of the serries so far. In part to compensate the most boring of them all, the book number 4, this one seems to reach the point in Westeros.
1855384841|1.0|A patronising piece of Americanese of the worst kind. As an Australian I am deeply insulted by this book and by the author's pathetic attempts to portray it as some sort of truth - a truth it could not be further from.<br /><br />Imagine the uproar if an Australian woman - one who had never been to America much less bothered to meet any native Americans -imagine if she attempted to sell a manufactured piece of garbage on native American culture to the rest of the world. Can you imagine the backlash?<br /><br />Apart from it's amateurish writing, clunky syntax and embarrasingly bad errors per paragraph (there are no phone booths in the outback lovey) - I am insulted for my country. But far, far more deeply, I am insulted for indigenous Australians. They have suffered enough indignity and cultural rape - this book is just one more example of it. May the author hang her head in shame.
B0038M2AZA|5.0|the movie came in time and in great conditions.  this is such a great movie i think eveyone should see it.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|I found this to be very concise, accurate, and short. Easy to find material for reference after reading and has a well constructed layout.
1419702238|5.0|I bought this for my son and he likes them alot. He has read all of them and not one complaint.
B0060ZJ78U|4.0|This movie tells how statistics and mathamatics made their way into baseball.  A recent college graduate comes to baseball and hooks up with a gereral manager who is willing to give it a shot.  Their trials with the \\"old hands\\" who do it by the seat of the pants is interesting and fun.  A worthwhile move, even if you aren'a baseball fan.
1419701533|5.0|My son started reading these books in 2nd grade, and he loves these books. He even reads them again because he likes them so much. This writer is so awsome and keeps the kids reading.
B0061NCTHC|5.0|Un concierto acústico muy bien logrado. Esta muy romántico y tiene bellas canciones. Totalmente recomendado. Lo que Pablo Alborán tiene es TALENTO. Esto es Talento! ERES HERMOSO!!! Todas sus canciones son perfectamente bellas y cada una de ellas me llena el alma de felicidad, eres más que un artista Pablo eres todo un maestro de la música, la manejas y las creas a la perfección. DIOS TE BENDIGA SIEMPRE! Es inexplicable el sentimiento que desprende cantando, es un gran artista, sigue así! A very good recording. Pablo Alborán shows all of his talent in this live album.
B008MEM24S|1.0|This game won't download! I'm really mad! I am surprised that this game is beating Temple Run Brave!!! Temple Run Brave is way better!!!!!
1601251505|4.0|The book is well made.  The game system itself is a good system.  It doesn't have all of the magic that D&D v4 has.  While this book doesn't have the entire world background, the supplments do and they are also well designed and allow for mutliple points from where to start.<br />I look forward to playing this game as I have an experienced game group with a great DM who is very dedicated.
B006FO3ERQ|1.0|Very well written prose but subject was boring  ,characters not well defined, and very  slow moving. It was a book I was glad to have finished for my book club.
B004ZN9W5M|3.0|This album is one of the greatest, ever.  That goes without saying.  What probably does NOT go without saying is that there is some shoddy work going into \\"remastering\\" efforts these days.  Even casual listeners may wonder why tape hiss wasn't removed from this recording, but what really bugs me is that there is audible clipping (distortion) at several of the louder points.  Absolutely ridiculous.  I heard it through my expen$ive home studio monitors AND through my expensive headphones.  Just to be sure what I was hearing wasn't a bug in MY system, I spoke to a friend several states away who purchased this, and he had the same experience.<br /><br />So...if you are just a casual listener who is going to pop this into your car stereo and sing to it at the top of your lungs (yes, I do this, too!), then fine--it's probably \\"good enough.\\"  But, for serious listeners?  Forget it!  Wait until they do a better job--whenever that may be...
