0792160347|4.0|American Gigolo is one of my favorite films and yet it is really not one of the greatest films that you might encounter. Shot in rich tones, particularly blues and greys, the director, Paul Schrader, wants us to know that we are not going to be afforded the opportunity to get to know the characters too well. One might be able to argue that American Gigolo was one of the films that literally catapulted the movie going public into the 1980's mindset of materialism.<br /><br />Richard Gere in one of his earliest films, protrays straight male call boy, Julian, who is tops in his game. Julian is gorgeous and knows many gorgeous women. He sleeps with those who will pay him. He doesn't bother with those who won't. Julian's lifestyle is one of everything \\"is a means to an end\\". He is interested in beautiful clothing and looking good, but because it helps him get something that he wants. He enjoys artwork and stylish digs, but not because he loves them, but because they are status symbols for his success. Julian enjoys being a gigolo because he is the best there is. He wouldn't (and doesn't) enjoy it when it isn't on his terms. For someone like me who feels he is too in tune with his emotions, Gere's Julian is cool, calculating and enviable. He goes about life without a care for anyone but himself.<br /><br />When Julian meets Lauren Hutton, he is actually smitten with her. This is evidenced by the meeting taking place in a bar with deep reds and comfortable upholstered booths instead of the abounding greys, blues, and steel evidenced elsewhere in the film.<br /><br />When Julian finally becomes intimate with Hutton and allows his emotional wall down for a moment, Schrader pulls us in close, but just afterward he lets us see that Julian can't maintain such intimacy and the camera pulls back for a long shot of him as he gets out of the bed leaving Lauren Hutton alone in the bed.<br /><br />The story is secondary to the style of the film. It is a thriller, but not an excitingone. The music of Georgio Moroder and Blondie complement the film and give it even more atmosphere. It needs it because the films two false endings drag this picture out longer than needed in trying to show us how emotional involvement can change someone. The message should be left that a lack of emotion can be dangerous.<br /><br />I rewatch this film every so often. It's a guilty pleasure watching the opening of the film with Julian driving down the PCH in his 450SL. Or when he's laying out different Armani outfits determining which to put on. Or looking at paintings, never deciding where he will hang them.
0060516070|5.0|I always learn a lot from Drucker.  Every single book he has written has become a classic in its own right, with basic prescriptions for many problems one often comes across in business and in life.  Although his book Innovation and Entrepreneurship is my all-time favorite, The Effective Executive, at least for me, is a very close second. <br /> <br />Drucker starts by defining who and what the executive is, and places him (and increasingly her) in the most appropriate context.  He is very careful to distinguish the executive from the more typical laborer.  Essentially, Drucker tells us that the executive is someone who is paid for what he or she knows, and not what he or she does.  The executive is supposed to know, for any situation, the following: what is the right thing to do, how to do it, and how to do it effectively.  Once this is identified, the executive has to make certain that those who do the right thing can do it well.  That is essentially the difference between management and labor.   <br /> <br />Some executives do manage and supervise, as these terms are traditionally used, but an executive has to do more than this.  He or she has to identify problems and opportunities, and in the case of problems, solve them, while in the case of opportunities, marshal all available resources to pursue them.  While decision-making is part of the executive's domain, it is what goes into the decision-making that is critical.  The real task of the executive is to think, make judgements, take focused action and ultimately bear the consequences of his or her actions.  In too many institutions, whether they are universities, coporations or government agencies, this action chain often breaks down, typically at the first step.  More often than not, however, actions are de-coupled from (bearing) the consequences.  As a result, Drucker spends a lot of time going over what it means to be an Effective Executive, as opposed to one of the many hangers-on who merely treads water and tries to curry favor through flattery, subterfuge or other devious and unsavory methods. <br /> <br />Drucker, I believe, is very likely the first to make the important distinction between effort and results.  Lots of people work hard, put in long hours on the job, yet have nothing to show for their effort.  Many will advance in rank and pay, but not based on merit, for they will get their promotions and pay raises based on time served.  Results are the end-product of effort- be it large or small, but effort,no matter how great or how dedicated, does not necessarily lead to results, issues of what constitutes 'results' (or even 'effort') aside.  This is why Drucker admonishes one to occupy himself or herself with results, and not efforts.  That said, Drucker emphasizes that every executive looking to be a better executive should spend a little time thinking about where his or her most important resource- time, goes. <br /> <br />Speaking of resources, Drucker also states that the two most important resources in any organization are knowledge and time.  Painful experience forces me to agree with his assertion.  The two once combined can equal favorable and positive results, if combined properly.  However, both of these resources have to be put to work through an organization, and with the assistance of other (hopefully like-minded) people.  The danger here is not that knowledge and time will be mis-applied, but that first, knowledge within an organization will go unutilized and second that some knowledge, such as that internal to the organization, will take precedence over the information and knowledge coming from the outside.  Too many institutions have grown stale simply because they have consciously chosen to emphasize what is going on inside the organization than what is occuring on the outside, and acting upon it.  Once again, painful experience forces me to agree with this brilliant insight. <br /> <br />However, Drucker also points out that information andknowledge exist pretty much outside of the organization, and for this he gets my undying respect.  People are the source of all knowledge, and in the global economy, people are mobile, so all knowledge, to some extent, will also be mobile.  An institution's success or failure then hinges on what comes through and walks out of the door every day.  This valuable insight ties into Drucker's last admonishment- focus on contribution.  Every executive should ask: 'What can I contribute of value?'; however, this question should be considered well within the context of the organization.  Yet again, painful experience forces me to admit that many institutions have specifically organized themselves so as not to have its personnel contribute something of value, no matter what their mission statements profess.  In such situations, it is best for the effective executive or those wishing to become effective executives to part ways with such an institution. <br /> <br />But fear not, while the book is a thinly veiled extended lecture on the importance of competence and good judgment in business relations, these things can be learned.  The path to becomig an effective executive demands some tribute upon the Altar of Bad Experience, but as for the rest, you can acquire it through careful study of history, anecdotal experience and the exercise of a few simple habits to be found in the book.  As Will Rogers once said, \\"Good judgment comes from experience.  And a lot of experience comes from bad judgment.\\" <br />   <br /> <br />
B000002UB3|5.0|This was the last album the Beatles recorded together although it was actually released before Let it be. The album is filled with many great Lennon-McCartney songs including Come together (a bluesy mid-tempo rocker), Maxwell's silver hammer and Oh darling, but the two best songs here - Something and Here comes the sun - are by George Harrison. George had written some good songs for the Beatles before, most notably While my guitar gently weeps (on the white album) but here he surpassed himself.<br /><br />Come together and Something were coupled as a double A-side for single release so it is a little surprising to find them on the album. In the sixties, singles were normally left off albums, but it may have been around this time that record companies abandoned this policy. No other singles were released from the album (at least in the UK) but Here comes the sun has been recorded by plenty of other artists and was a UK top ten hit for Steve Harley and Cockney Rebel in 1976. It would surely have been a much bigger hit if it had been released as a Beatles single in 1969.<br /><br />Octopus's garden features Ringo Starr as lead singer and while it is easy to dismiss as a novelty song, it is one of the better songs of its kind and it was included on the blue album (1967 - 1970) instead of Oh darling or Maxwell's silver hammer. The remaining songs are great but they seem ordinary by Beatles standards. The best of them may be Golden slumbers and Carry that weight.<br /><br />This is a great album (of course - all Beatles albums are - but there are a few of their earlier albums that I enjoy even more. especially Magical mystery tour and Rubber soul.
B000274THQ|2.0|I watched the movie, I laughed at the jokes, I understand the plot but I simply cannot accept this movie as a defence-in-disguise of a regime that was positively criminal in nature. The mother in this movie is a diehard Communist-by-conviction. She is consistently portrayed as a good, idealistic Commie who had been let down by those evil power-hungry Commies - the subtle punchline being that Communist ideals are OK whereas the Cold War implementation in the Eastern Bloc was bad. Having lived on the wrong side of the Iron curtain for some time, I personally think that it was not just the implementation but that the Communist ideals are inherently flawed.<br /><br />As the title of my review points out, most intelligent people would not accept a similar movie made on the basis of any other inhuman regime of the present or the past. Imagine a plot where a German Frau falls in a coma in March 1945, wakes up a few months later and her kids put up a show pretending the Fuhrer is still in charge. That would not be a great movie, it would be a scandal. And don't even get me started on Good bye, Jefferson Davis.<br /><br />Look, the movie is entertaining, it is reasonably well done and it may even be educational for those who want to learn about the moods and public opinion in Germany around the time of the fall of the Berlin Wall. But I cannot accept as great work of art something that makes the point of (even indirectly) defending oppression, inhumanity and intolerance. Hence 2 stars.
B000002MX7|5.0|I never paid much attention to Chaka Khan until a friend and fellow reviewer persuaded me to listen to her music and that of Rufus, the group she once fronted.  Of course, he was right - Chaka is a great singer.<br /><br />Chaka Khan's biggest hit was I feel for you, which made number two in her American homeland and number one in Britain. I'm every woman and Ain't nobody (with Rufus) are among her other classic hits on both sides of the Atlantic.<br /><br />This compilation is a great introduction to the music of Chaka Khan, but if you enjoy this, also look up Rufus, whose Greatest hits I've already reviewed.
B000008JUM|5.0|A tribute album of Cole Porter tunes as performed by some of the best musicians to come out of the 1980s. David Byrne of the Talking Heads, the Pogues, Tom Waits, U2, The Fine Young Cannibals, Annie Lennox, Jimmy Somerville of Bronski Beat, The Thompson Twins, Sinead O'Connor. There are three fantastic reasons to purchase this album: 1) It's 20 Cole Porter standards, 2) The album was produced in 1990 to benefit AIDS research, 3) The incomparable lineup of the musicians, mentioned above, plus Neneh Cherry, the Neville Brothers, Debbie Harry of Blondie and Iggy Pop, KD Lang, Erasure, Jody Watley, Aztec Camera and more.<br /><br />Any one of these three reasons should be reason enough to buy this album, and if you score with all three on your list, then you will be overwhelmingly pleased. If you are simply a Cole Porter fan, have never heard of these bands and don't care to support AIDS research, then you will likely be unhappy with this album. But if you are even a fan of just one or two of these artists, the rest of the album will surprise and seduce you.<br /><br />Perhaps the best track on the whole album is The Neville Brothers' \\"In the Still of the Night.\\" Simply enchanting. David Byrne shines with the best of the best work from the Talking Heads era, African drumming and rhythms, on \\"Don't Fence Me In.\\" Kirsty MacColl sings with the Pogues in a medley of \\"Miss Otis Regrets\\" and \\"Just One of Those Things,\\" and for this long-time Pogues fan, it was surprising to find this musically rich track a full decade after the Pogues had split up. Wish I had known about this album in 1990 rather than finding it in 2004. Tom Waits takes some heat with other reviewers with his cover of \\"It's All Right With Me,\\" but those reviewers obviously wouldn't like ANY Tom Waits tunes. I think it's a fantastic layer to this already rich hued album, and Waits fills his portion with gusto and relish. It is truly the tune I love to listen to the most, partly because it follows Byrne's cut and mostly because it just sucks me into another world, that Tom Waits World, and repeatedly sucks the breath out of me. I especially love the part where it seems like the song is over and then Waits comes back in for a reprise, doubly so after reading how much is pisses off some of the other reviewers. :-)<br /><br />Neneh Cherry offers a prologue to the album that melds directly into her cover of \\"I've Got You Under My Skin\\" and the Fine Young Cannibals wail into \\"Love For Sale\\" with Roland Gift's voice nearly being mistaken for a muted trumpet. How did he do that? Iggy Pop and Debby Harry have too much fun with \\"Well Did You Evah\\" and until I looked at the credits I actually thought it was John Doe and Exene Cervenka from X. They should have been asked to contribute to this album. And Screamin' Jay Hawkins, he has a cut of \\"I Love Paris\\" that while is a bit more traditional than Les Negresses Vertes' version which is pure fun, Hawkins covering another Porter tune would have added more layers of spice to this CD. The Thompson Twins and Erasure shine with two songs I would never expect to hear from them, \\"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire\\" and \\"Too Darn Hot,\\" respectively. U2, Annie Lennox, KD Lang, Jody Watley, Sinead O'Connor and Aztec Camera all provide the solid stability of their talents to flesh out the core of the album, with the color added by the previously mentioned artists. The two tracks that could easily be lost and replaced by better artists are Salif Keita with \\"Begin the Beguine\\" and the Jungle Brothers with \\"I Get a Kick.\\"<br /><br />Purchase this album. It's a great tribute to Cole Porter and an even better contribution to supporting AIDS research. Get it to honor rare work of these excellent artists. All thumbs up! Five stars and more!se it just sucks me into another world, that Tom Waits World, and repeatedly sucks the breath out of me.

B0000024RB|5.0|After some earlier successes, Andy Williams joined Columbia in 1962 and recorded two albums for them that year - Danny Boy and Moon River, which helped to set his career going in the direction he wanted it.<br /><br />Following encouraging sales of Andy's first Columbia album (Danny boy), his second, Moon River, brought together a collection of movie themes and made the top three in the American album charts. Curiously, the title track was never released as a single although it became his signature song. (In the UK, the song became a number one hit for Danny Williams - no relation).<br /><br />Apart from the title track, the album contains Andy's excellent interpretations of such classics as A summer place, Maria, Never on Sunday, As time goes by, It might as well be spring, Three coins in the fountain and others.<br /><br />With the Danny Boy and Moon River albums, Andy left nobody in any doubt that he was a ballad singer with no interest in recording up-tempo songs. That he was able to build a career as a balladeer despite changing musical fashions is a measure of the man's talent.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly brings back the art of storytelling in a warm, lived-in sort of texture. The characters are deep, and the relationships between them even deeper. The episodes are unhurried and smart, trusting that the audience will be sharp enough to get it. Even the cinematic work is beautiful, catching the ship, Serenity, as if it were a character itself, regarding it with respect and love.
B0006A9FMI|4.0|Innocence has incredible animation that rivals even the original.  Human movement beautifully documented, at least as well as Perfect Blue.  The action scenes are brilliantly choreographed.  It's creepy as all get-out, and I liked it. <br /> <br />But, the plot was rather bland, the characters shallow (they're better in the Stand Alone Complex), and the movie is way too full of pretentious, convoluted, pseudo-philosophical, wannabe-intellectual garbage.  It's even more ridiculous than the original. <br /> <br />It's still worth watching.  You can fast-forward through the talking.
B0002Z9HT8|5.0|This is one of the best music DVD's  I have ever seen (the best being Led Zeppelin Live). There are plenty of good acts on here. It is much like going back to the origonal Airing, with the exception of the MTV Hosting. It isin't cheap in most places where you will find it, but it is worth the cost. The four Disks are worth every penny. This was never released on video for some reason to remain unknown. This DVD set is great and well worth it.
B00005N83M|5.0|Man, sometimes i totally forget about some great cd's.  who ever thought that \\"great cd\\" would be in a jennifer lopez album review?!?  BUT, this is the pentacle  of her album success.  Never will she record an album as upbeat, sexy, fun & dancable as this one.  Her new stuff... Get Right, Jenny from the Block have nothing on this album.   <br />Aint it Funny is such a heart wrenching song!!!  The only song i've ever heard j.lo sing with any emotion.   <br />Walking on Sunshine?!?!  How can you not get up and jump up and down!!! <br />PLAY!?!?!  PLAY!?!??!  pop music gets no better than this song!
B0002IVN9W|5.0|Alright kids, I'm not big on writing stuff on here, but I just felt so compelled to put in my two cents after listening to this album for the past six months, and NOT GETTING TIRED OF IT. At all. This is my favorite album of 2004, hands down. Just the first song itself builds up through so many different levels, it just blows you away. I've been trying to see these guys live for a while now, but no dice. That's ok, I'm content to listen to this amazing record over and over. As you can tell, I still can't believe how amazing these guys are. Do yourself a favor. Buy this, listen to it a few times, and thank me later.
B00025ETIW|4.0|I saw half the music video on MusicPlus and bought the album the next day...and I've listened to it over and over and over again.  The style, the lyric, the sound, the music, everything is GREAT on this album.  Can't wait to see 'em live!  If you are looking for something really great to listen to...BUY THIS ALBUM!
B0002Z0EYK|1.0|This movie recieves one star due to the fact in can interest others to read the book. The movie itself was awful and it did not resemble the book. It was a Gladiator wannabe with the Achilles character and music score. The movie just had the characters from the Illiad and that was it. The story changed so much it annoyed many people. It is best to read the book.  <br /> <br /> Warner Bros. I heard was suppose to do Lord of the Rings but they wanted it to be one movie instead of the three that was put out. Troy in my opinion is an indication of what the studio did to ruin a story of a classic book. Lord of the Rings was saved from being butchered since Warner Bros. did not do the films. It is unfortunate The Trojan War of the Illiad was not saved and the story ruined.
B0002TT0NW|5.0|The last time that I reviewed a \\"Harry Potter\\" film (The dismal \\"Chamber of Secrets\\"), I called the Harry Potter phenomenon \\"Wiccan Propaganda\\" However, I see now that I was biased, and letting my religious beliefs trump something that is indeed intriguing. The books are getting children to read, and that is good. I asked to be forgiven for this fault. So now for my review of \\"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban.\\"<br /><br />It is an exciting and beautifully-crafted fantasy adventure that features great special effects, fine storytelling, and fascinating characters brought to life by an exceptional cast. Any fan of fantasy will enjoy this, a marked improvement over both \\"The Sorcerer's Stone\\" and \\"The Chamber of Secrets.\\" Movie/DVD Grade: A-
B0006A9FKA|5.0|You are missing one of the rare best zombie movie we have in years. <br />Don't read any review anymore and go watch this movie already.
B0002234LS|3.0|This movie gave me nightmares.  Not that this is necessarily a problem!  I'm all for a great suspense thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat and gives you a couple of really good scares, which this did... however there was more out-and-out pointless violence than I wanted to see.  I'm a HUGE fan of the whole M. Night Shyamalan subtle thriller... movies of that class don't need to show much to scare the pants off you, but this one was not up to that par... it relied too much on graphic violence and gore.  I was going to give it two stars, but the corn scene in the end won it an extra one... if nothing else it was really entertaining!
B00005JMX6|4.0|The first time I saw Elisha Cuthbert so sexy on the poster in town, I told to myself : \\"Another useless teen movie!\\" And I decide to know what was the story about it. I'm fed up of \\"American pie & Co\\". <br />The movie is like another Risky Business (1983-Tom Cruise/Rebecca DeMornay). Is still different because of the plot of the movie. In the first one, the main character Joel meet some prostitute and decide to become a pimp because all the money he can make. In the other, Matthew, because of his love for Danielle, go to college and take her out of the porno movie business.  <br /> <br /> Two films with the same idea to do things unusual but with two different ways to make is life. Good movies.
0790732254|4.0|After the couple Martha and George has come home from a party, few time later another couple, Honey and Nick, arrives, because they were invited to a little party. The fact that they are very drunken leads Martha and George into heavy conflict, in which Honey and Nick get more and more involved until the party ends as a \\"horrortrip\\". <br /> <br />The film version \\"Who's afraid of Virginia Woolf?\\" from Mike Nichols is almost a sensation. First the actors are chosen very good, what you can see in being nominated for Oscar. Also the gestures and expressions are fine, so that the viewer gets involved easily and cannot stop watching the film.
B0000DD7LC|5.0|Alcia keys is amazing and I am so excited to finally have her second album. Great songs like karma, diary, and more. MMM. mmm good.
B00003CXRP|4.0|While I will agree with many other reviewers:<br /><br />1. This is an excellent performance by Tom Hanks<br />2. The story and performance transcend the need for constant dialog<br />3. This is a gripping tale of survival<br /><br />I also think such observations miss the point of the film entirely.<br /><br />While being literally stranded on an island is ostensibly the main plot of the film, the real intent is to use this as an allegory or metaphor for the immense changes that life often brings.<br /><br />Told in three acts, Cast Away is the story of Chuck Noland (Hanks) a man entirely in control of his life (waiting on marriage, dating the right girl, good career, friends, etc.) when he is unexpectedly stranded. After years of waiting he is rescued by an angel's wings in the form a port-a-john wall. When he returns he finds everything he knew has changed.<br /><br />How many of us have undergone similar transitions in life? Times when we seem to plateau or enter a dark tunnel and wonder if we will ever come out at the end. And when we do finally emerge we find we have entered a world unlike the one we left. This is the real story of Cast Away.<br /><br />Symbolism is used frequently. His girlfriend on the island is merely a locket picture. The pocket watch he checks so carefully has stopped. Other images or devices are repeated or used for effect (angel wings, fire, Wilson, Chuck's physical changes).<br /><br />Perhaps I give the story too much credit, but I think if you watch it again (or for the first time), you might see a different film than you were expecting. And perhaps you can find some parrallel to a time in your life when you have been Cast Away, only to return to a new and different world.<br /><br />What more can you ask from a Tom Hanks movie?
0156027321|5.0|The ending, in my personal, interpretative opinion, wasn't meant to frustrate the reader, nor was it a cop out by the author. If your main source of irritation was simply that you felt you had wasted time reading something that turned out differently than you expected/hoped, then perhaps you are exactly who the author intended to engage most in deeper thought. And to those people, are you spiritual/religious? If the answer is yes, then recheck your faith and basic beliefs, if the answer is no (you find religious folks silly and ignorant), then you might want to rethink your judgments. I think Martel makes a strong case for why religions, and the stories on which they are based, hold such a strong allure. The first 94 chapters certainly were not a waste if the ending left you wondering which version of the truth to believe; welcome to your spiritual awakening.<br /><br />We ALL want to believe in Richard Parker and the carnivorous island. I took away a better understanding of Pi's experience and the author's message when it was based in the context of Pi's original story. And I'm probably the only one, but I skimmed the entire portion of the alternative story.  I assumed its purpose was for entirely different reasons than was actually the case. Little did I know I nearly missed the book's entire raison d'être. But my actions only further prove Martel's point. We don't WANT 'realistic' and 'logical' when it comes to thoughts, experiences and \\"yarns\\" that are meant to, rather, promise to, alter our reality. In fact, it would be oxyMORONIC - pun intended.<br /><br />If you liked the first story better, if you wanted to believe it so much that you gave the book only 1 star b/c of the ending, then should belief in the Bible/Quaran/Rig Veda/Epic of Gilgamesh be so hard to understand? This book may not make you believe in God, but for all those who felt cheated - you can certainly see why 95% of the world wants to / needs to / must  and do believe in something. That, perhaps, is one of the most important realizations you could possibly take from this amazing book.perhaps, is one of the most important realizations you could possibly take from this amazing book. <br />
B000002MTR|1.0|all the bio info about this album is true, what they leave out is that it's terrible.  anthony keidis has always been relatively weak as a participant, and this album forces his lyrics to the front on over charged multi layered guitar driven boredom trips.  none of the playfulness, dynamics or spirit from blood sugar is here.  if there is any resembling their early music it's that this album sounds really undeveloped.  thank goodness john returned for californication, which, while not a return to form of 91 chili peppers (who needs to stay 8 years behind yrself?) is a great step forward.  narvarro belongs in hollywood bars playing boring rock music and re-uniting with janes addiction for the 15th time.
B0000C9ZLD|5.0|I was a little hesitant to give this album a chance because of the negative hype The Strokes were getting.  But I am REALLY glad I did.  This album is one of those albums in which every song is extremely catchy and well done.  It's very rare that one can find an album, and listen to the entire thing without pressing the skip button at least once. <br /> <br />It starts off with \\"What ever happened?\\" a rather mellow but extremely catchy tune with a signature sound The Strokes seemed to have mastered.  It then goes into \\"Reptilia\\", probably the crown achievement of the album.  The single from the album is really fun and almost grunge-esque in style, the whole album taking on this garage genre of music.  It keeps going in which the music doesn't get tiring or boring, each song keeps the foot tapping. <br /> <br />I would say, if you really aren't into a more mellow sound or grunge sound, this is not the album for you.
B00005JKGZ|5.0|Alright -- listen up. Every one of these reviews gives Meet Me in St. Louis five stars out of five. It's one of the finest classic movies EVER... and so underappreciated! Buy it now... this is Judy Garland's greatest role at the peak of her talents. It's breathtaking.
0425188809|2.0|Those reviewers that have characterized this as one of Koontz's finest works are absolutely right. Those reviewers who have characterized this effort as mediocre (or worse) are equally correct: with very few exceptions (this is NOT one of them), \\"mediocre\\" is the highest praise reasonably afforded to the body of Koontz's work.<br /><br />I bought a copy of Watchers in 1988 or '89. The teaser on the cover was one word: \\"spine-tingling.\\" Or is that two words? Regardless, the story evinced nary a tingle. We've got a super-smart dog, and a super-smart animal of no particular biological classification, and an emotionally hermetic, lone-wolf hero, and a fragile heroine in need of rescuing, and some FBI agents, and a serial killer. If the condensed version just offered sounds a little jumbled, trust me, the full version is no better. The plot manages not to be confusing only because it's so simplistic and silly.<br /><br />Really, this is more of a \\"boy and his dog\\" story (a la Where the Red Fern Grows); note the number of reviewers who enjoyed the bonding between protagonists (and who doesn't love the image of a Golden Retriever wearing a Santa hat at Christmas?). I guess somewhere along the line, someone realized that this didn't really fall into the horror category; maybe they were afraid it would be placed in the \\"Pets\\" section at the bookstore.  So Mr. Koontz had to come up with some monsters in a hurry. Okay, how about a super-smart monster to go with your super-smart dog? Not enough? How about a psychopath? Why is he in the story? Who cares? How about some morally ambiguous government agents--everybody's scared of the government, right?<br /><br />Still not enough? Did I mention the film version stars Corey Haim? He's dreamy! Or at least my big sister said he was. In 1987.<br /><br />Koontz has a formula, and it obviously works. Read two or three of his books, however, and you start to forget which characters belong in which story, and which plot devices lead to which \\"spine tingling conclusion.\\" Rule of thumb: a book is rarely \\"good\\" if you can't recall the title after reading it. People tend to characterize Koontz's works as \\"the one about the aliens,\\" or \\"the one about the crazy guy who killed all those people.\\" The only problem: that's pretty much all of his books!<br /><br />Notable exception: read \\"Phantoms.\\" Reading that one, I felt my spine tingle a little.lead to which \\"spine tingling conclusion.\\" Rule of thumb: a book is rarely \\"good\\" if you can't recall the title after reading it.

7119005901|3.0|The Three Kingdoms have been, since its creation, the staple of literature in the Orient. It has been translated into Korean, Japanese, and numerous other languages and has been read by scholars, historians, and military strategists everywhere in Northern Asia. However, as anyone who has already read the Three Kingdoms in any of the North Eastern Asian languages will promise, the English version unfortunately does not capture the essence in which the \\"Odyssey\\" of China rose to its widespread fame and ubiquity. It lacks the characterstics that demand to stand as one of the greatest historical and legendary pieces in existence today. That is why it is literature, not simply history. The artistic hand of Luo Guanzhong is almost wiped off and a bland history with awkward word choice is left that leaves little to imagination and wonder. <br /> <br />For people who are interested in the epics of Chinese literature, to gain a simple understanding of the events and perhaps some of the strategies, the book can be recommended. However, to truly appreciate the epic that has created sayings that if you read the story three times, you can be deemed a scholar, the translation simply lacks too much.  <br /> <br />It is unfortunately, another case of great literature unable to be shared since it was lost in translation.

B00005JNBQ|3.0|Well, what I can say about this one. Up to this point I've heard a lot about Napoleon Dynamite, but I never believed the rumors to be true up till now. Let's just say you could not enjoy it if you were not already committed to a high school. This is definitely not a family movie. And, I would caution anyone that is dry humored to stay away from this one. You can not really appreciate it unless you or someone you know could relate to it. It is off the wall funny. Each scene gives you a taste for what to expect next. But, I think the opening line, of the movie, says it all! This is not the first time I've seen this and it probably won't be the last. True, But, I think the one reason it has got so much vibe is that, in truth we all very much like Napoleon Dynamite in some way.  <br /> <br />
B00005MNP8|5.0|Blondie's third album was where they grabbed the lightning rod. Producer Mike Chapman understood the band perfectly, honing the groups pop leanings with his own razor sharp production style and Debbie Harry's star vocals. It led to a dazzling combination of hook laden hits and sexy experiments, and made Debbie new wave's first bona-fide icon.<br /><br />There are a dozen flawless pop numbers here, from the disco-punk cross of the mega-hit \\"Heart Of Glass\\" to Robert Fripp's sinuous guitar on \\"Fade Away And Radiate.\\" The key was both in the production (the liner notes state that the band was not used to the kind of task-mastering for Chapman's rigid work style) and in the band's songwriting. All the band members contributed, with the Harry/Stein axis taking the lead. That also brought out great songs from guitarist Infante (\\"I Know But I Don't Know\\") and bassist Harrison (the punky hit \\"One Way Or Another\\"). The band became fearless in their genre mixing - remember the cries of \\"sell-out\\" when \\"Heart Of Glass\\" charted? - and their determination to be great.<br /><br />Of the bonus cuts, the real treat is the band's concert workout of \\"Bang A Gong\\" which briefly incorporates \\"These Boots Are Made For Walking.\\" It sounds, live, like a roaring good time. The other two concert tracks are fun, but not as revelatory. There is also a demo of \\"Heart Of Glass,\\" which shows exactly how much Chapman worked with the band on polish.<br /><br />\\"Parallel Lines\\" achieved that greatness. This was one of the earliest of the new-wave's short list of classic albums, along with The Cars, Joe Jackson and Elvis Costello.
B0001GF2DS|5.0|And to assume so would be incredibly stupid of someone, why before I saw this movie I had never really given westerns a try thinking they all had the same boring plot,paper-thin characters,and uninspired lines.  How wrong I was! I'm so glad I bought this movie since it has become one of my personal favorites. With that said this is Sergio Leones third enstallment in the \\"Man with no name\\" series(I have yet to see \\"For a Few Dollars More\\") and is easily the best, the cinematography is breathtaking and no shot is wasted, the acting is excellent, Eastwood portraying one of the best \\"heroes\\" in a movie I've ever seen, and the music which I love fits in perfectly with the movie. This movie strikes a chord with me deep down, don't ask why it just does and I love every second of it. If you still have yet to see this movie, then don't hesitate to rent or buy it whenever you have the chance! Also, this has opened me up to the western genre and I have seen other classics such as The Wild Bunch, Unforgiven, The Searchers and Once upon a time in the west.
0782008119|4.0|the reason I bought this video was for the breif glimpes of the hardest rock n' roll band in the world, yes the SUPERSUCKERS!! In the video they were interviewed twice and a snippet of live footage of the song \\"I Say F#(K\\" was used. Eddie Looks to be about the age of 10 in this movie. Oh yeah.. some band called Nirvana? is also in this great documentry of grunge music. So if your a Suckers fan and want some early obscure footage of this, in my opinion the epitomy of a rock n' roll band, this video is where it's at. P.S. any east coast Sucker fans?
B000002GBB|4.0|Styx garner as much support from music critics as the lady on the cover might garner for a miss-world competition. Oh, and they sold lots of records. So, must mean they're \\"commercial\\" right?    Well they probably are. If they wanted to prove they're not commercial, they could write a 20-minute symphony featuring backward Tibetan Chanting, organ solos with names like 'the incontinent rabbit who cuddled caring cactus \\"part 82\\"' and the cover would be of an open field, with a big, purple sky. And, if they really were commercial they'd write sappy ballads with lyrics like 'And Babe I love you' and 'It's the first time for love', and everyone who was around in '78 knew Styx would NEVER do that.     Instead, they made powerfully sung arena-rock anthems, that were catchy and were adorned with colourful organs and synths. And they kinda made up for the lack of, you know, 80-minute symphonies, with an eerie aura that oversees the whole thing. Styx were masters of aura and they were at their peak with 'Pieces of Eight'. Now Mr. 1978 man can't wait for the next album, he just know it's GONNA be good. Rating ****
0393312836|5.0|If you're tired of reading the same ol' stories with a goody two-shoes protagonist, who has some sort of dilemma then through a miraculous epiphany he finds his way and everyone holds hands and sings kumbaya, then this is the book for you! (Whatever you do, do not read the last chapter!!!!)    This is a very dark and satirical novel with a very fresh dialogue. Burgess uses a language called Nadsat to alienate the main character and his \\"droogies\\" from the rest of the world. If you have the capacity to read at a slightly higher level (like Shakespeare or Dante), or are enamored by the challenge, then this story will have you quoting it months after you're finished with it. And if you're IQ is above average you might even recognize the author's sporadic humor and sarcasm.    Alex suffers from some kind of psychopathic disorder, and the society he lives in has incubated all the malice that lives within him. He is very clever, brave, witty, articulate, and not exactly what you would call a delicate flower.     After the government experiments with a highly effective and novel rehabilitation method, Alex becomes an ideal citizen, but he suffers every day and wants to kill himself. His life becomes \\"Clockwork\\" and loses its purpose (I don't know where the orange part comes from).    As you read it you will be confused as to how you are cheering on this menace, which kills, robs, and does other horrific activities. However, this is where Burgess' genius becomes apparent and makes the book a classic. You the reader experience what Alex experiences when he goes through the rehabilitation process, he starts feeling and doing things that are contradictory to his natural state of being, and hence becomes mere \\"clockwork.\\" Even though he is a malevolent character you yourself are in oppression of something greater and can't help liking him and hoping for his reincarnation so to speak.    All of the characters are interesting and the encounters with one another are real. The onlyfolly of the book is its 21st chapter. I don't know hat happened here but the book is pure magic until its last chapter, where it abandons its key premise and succumbs to social pressures and suddenly becomes politically correct. Nonetheless, the book is profound intelectual bliss-you can end with the 20th chapter and it makes complete sense.    I recommend this book to anyone who is not superficial and is looking for a thoughtful experience. Please do not judge this book by its movie! This clich was probably coined specifically for this book. The movie has a completely different ambiance and misses the artistic brilliance of the author. The book is probably 5 times more interesting, more entertaining, and much better.    It's a great read, and will have you scratching your head by the end of the book, not because it's confusing, but because you can't put it down and thus have no time to shower.    In My Humble Onion  John G (Find Me Please)
B0001YRVN4|5.0|I hadn't seen this trilogy since watching them in the movie theater in the 1970's!  It is still amazing, especially when you think about how advanced the movies were for their time! George  was incredibly creative with those movies!  And as for all the people that are hung up on the few changes that he has made...well, get over it!  It's George Lucas's creative outlet, so either watch them or don't!  Just let go of it, and enjoy the brillance of this trilogy!
0780626494|5.0|This terrific feel good film is just right for all ages. It has great acting, a wonderful romantic story, and an even better message. With many memorable scenes, lines, and a great soundtrack.     Christopher Walken is hilarious as a fun-loving genius that is utterly paranoid of the Soviet Empire.     Adam has been living in a fallout shelter for his entire life and suddenly is free and required to come above ground. Adam's naive and innocent character makes for many funny moments.  Eve: A \\"Rob Roy,\\" I thought only hookers drank that stuff.  Adam: Well I know mom sure loves them.    The movie is full of great writing and memorable lines.   Adam: Mom, dad, we must hurry I'm being chased by a psychologist.  Crazy Friend: It's ok, it happens from time to time to everyone.    The movie really shows how our society has lost some of its innocents, however it also shows the beauty of a loving family, the true love between a man and a woman, and the importance of a fallout shelter.    I highly recommend this movie to everyone. I've seen it many times and it never gets old.    In My Humble Opinion  John G (Find Me)
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I was raised on musical theater, the classics like ALW's Phantom of the Opera, Evita and even others like Into The Woods and, more recently, Rent.  I know all the songs by heart and listen to them still today.  I had heard about Wicked from several people calling it, \\"the next big thing\\" on broadway.  The reviews were phenomenal and the show boasted two of my favorite stars, Idina and Kristin.  But I was reluctant to listen to the soundtrack.  To this day, I do not know why but something inside of me would not let me sit down for the better part of an hour and listen to something completely different.  As chance would have it, I did eventually sit down and listen to \\"Defying Gravity\\".  And then everything changed. <br /> <br />The feeling that I got upon hearing this song was one that defies words.  To be honest, I was completely floored by it.  I had never been both so intrigued and amazed by a song in my entire life.  I needed no more prodding to give the rest of the CD a try and by the end, I was completely hooked. <br /> <br />Every song on the CD glows with a light that makes you want to listen to it again and again.  I have probably heard \\"Defying Gravity\\" in times numbering in the 100's but it has never been nor will ever be boring to me.  \\"Popular\\" delivers comedic genius at the hands of the lovely Kristin Chenoweth while the two combine earlier in the gem, \\"What is This Feeling?\\".  It's hard not to mention the tour de force opening as well as \\"For Good\\" and \\"As Long As Your Mine\\" as the obvious standout songs from the show that are simply wonderful, no pun intended, on this album. <br /> <br />From top to bottom, start to finish, Wicked defies all expectations and, while some reviews may argue that the songs and lyrics lack the quality of some of my old favorites, Wicked stands alone, showing where Broadway is going.  And I couldn't be happier.
0316666343|2.0|I purchased the book after reading an editorial review. I thought it had a novel concept, no pun intended (the protagonist of the story already being deceased).      After an interesting first ten or so pages, the book became extremely difficult to read, it seemed to never end, it had no mystery what so ever even though we know who her murder is, except maybe with her mother leaving her father from what appeared to be some sort of post-traumatic stress issue (i'm not a psychologist or anything).    The one interesting character was her younger sister who seemed to be superfluously praised with all of her wunderkind attributes, who by the way, as intelligent and emotionally connected to her sister as she was, didn't hesitate for a second when losing her virginity at a very young age, considering the horrific tragedy that had befallen her older sister. Even the her murderer wasn't well written. I mean the reader should really grow to hat this guy, but nothing. I just couldn't get emotionally interested in any of the characters nor the plot.    Ultimately, it's a primitively written book about a young girl who tragically dies, and lives vicariously through her sister, and observes the inevitable break-up and make-up of her family.    After finally finishing the book (like a month later!) I came to the conclusion that the author had written an excellent poem at one point or another and then thought to herself \\"hey, I can take this poem, stretch it to three hundred some pages, give it an endearing title, and make some money.\\"    Overall, it's a waste of time. Not much of a plot, no mystery, and any male reader will need relentless convincing from a female counterpart to finish it. (Oh my goodness, what has been implied here?)    In My Humble Opinion  John G (Find me!)
B0002OERI0|5.0|This is one of the great pop/rock records i've heard in awhile.  I'm not to interested in many mainstream bands but i loved Green Day's first 2 cd's, Smoothed out Slappy Hours and Kerplunk and never really got into there cd's after that.  The lyrics are interesting and unique, the guitars are louder than they usually are to me.  A little over produced but still very great.  Lot's of people say its a fad to hate Bush and be angry at him but if this is what they want to do they can and it turned out great.  It seems to me to be a bit louder and faster than some of there previous stuff.  I even put this album before dookie and even Kerplunk.  I recomend it to anyone who likes good music or is into poppy/punk or pop/rock music.
B0002X314C|5.0|With the release of John Legend's debut GET LIFTED, there is hope for R&B music lovers everywhere. Before John, Alicia Keys was carrying the torch all by herself, but here comes John Legend to the rescue. This debut CD deserves all of the praise its getting and more. And once again, Kanye West showcases his talent as a producer. <br /> <br />John opens the album with the hypnotic LET'S GET LIFTED and closes with the equally mesmerizing LIVE IT UP. He is like a modern day Stevie Wonder/Ray Charles/Marvin Gaye all blended together. If you can imagine that with a contemporary flavor, then you'll understand the nature of this recording. It's truly very special. His live version of \\"Ordinary People\\" on Jay Leno was even better than the recorded version.  <br /> <br />I hope people haven't written off R&B for good because this is an album you don't want to miss. Give John a chance because he'll surprise you. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
0385513755|5.0|Lured by the urging of a Lutheran friend, who even loaned me her regular edition book, I commenced. I got so into it that I ceased reading until I could order and receive this illustrated edition.<br /><br />Don't recall \\"Winged Victory?\\" No problema. The picture is embedded right there in the text in which it is referred.  Need a close-up of Mona Lisa or The Last Supper? They're in here! This gorgeous glossy \\"Coffee-Table-able\\" edition is big and beautiful.  Its heft, though, does make it somewhat less portable than other editions and a tad less maneuverable for bedtime reading - but such minor inconveniences are outweighed by its obviation of collateral references.<br /><br />Of course this captivating caper is not Gospel! It's derivative fiction, folks! And it makes no apocryphal pretentions to be otherwise. `Tis a grand thriller!  /TundaVision, Amazon Reviewer
B0002X314C|5.0|I THINK THAT JOHN LEGEND IS A VERY TALENTED ARTIST. ALL THE SONGS ON THIS ALBUM IS GREAT. NOT A LOT OF PEOPLE CAN DO THAT ON THEIR VERY FIRST RECORD. I CAN SEE HIM BEING AROUND FOR A VERY VERY VERY LONG TIME. I LOVE HIM AND THIS CD. IT IS VERY CATCHY ALBUM, AND IT ALSO HAS A LOT OF GREAT AND BEAUTIFUL SONGS. HE IS ONE OF MT FAVORTIE ARTISTS RIGHT NOW. I KNOW HE IS GOING TO BE AROUND FOR YEARS TO COME. I LOVE HIS VOICE AND THE WAY HE SINGS...ITS SOOOOO BEAUTIFUL. I LIKE THE CD THE MOMENT I HEAR THE SAMPLES. :) HE HAS A WAY WITH WORDS AND HOW HE PUTS THEM TOGETHER IN A SONG. THAT IS A GOD-GIVEN GIFT THAT JOHN LEGEND HAS. I RECOMMEND PEOPLE TO BUY THIS CD....YOU WILL NOT BE  DISAPPOINTED.
B000005IU1|4.0|Despite at times sounding like a bad imitation of The Doors, Iggy Pops debut is undoubtedly one of the most unique albums you'll ever find. Raw and weird, after 20 years of release it still sounds 20 years ahead.
B00005J6T0|4.0|I love this album. It's my third favorite except for Jimmy Jimmy. True Blue is her song about Sean Penn, Live to Tell is my favorite song ballad which has the video also with the movie At Close Range with Sean Penn. Papa Dont Preach is about her Keeping her baby which many people found controversial I dont know why, awesome video though. Open Your Heart is obviously great and so is White Heat. Where's The Party is also awesome. Please get this CD. The new ones have special remixes for True Blue oh yeah I forgot the beautiful La Isla Bonita, I love that song so much. She looked so pretty in the video too!! La Isla Bonita has a special remix too. I am glad she sang it at her Drownd World Tour which I was lucky enough to see twice!!!
B00005JNBQ|1.0|I saw the 10 minute short film that this movie was based on and liked it a lot.  I was ready to rush out and see it in the theater until the local paper said it was horrible.  After that, EVERYONE who saw it told me it was HILARIOUS... damn those stuck-up newspaper movie reviewers.   So rushed out and got the DVD, only to find out that this movie is just as stupid as the local paper made it out to be.    <br />     This movie is basically a few funny halloween costumes stretched into a feature film.  It is silly, but rarely if ever funny or clever.   I like dumb comedies, but this one is down there with the likes of \\"Stuck on You\\".   <br /> <br />     Go rent Beavis and Butthead, Sixteen Candles, Wayne's World, Rushmore... this movie is a pale shadow of those and others.
B00005Q66T|4.0|This is a great collection, but where is Rain and Fever.  I absolutely love those two songs. The 2 songs thats should have been skipped even though I know it needed to be added is Take A Bow and Human Nature. Human Nature should have been replaced with Rain and Take A Bow with Fever. I never cared too much for Human Nature the song is just horrible although I love the songs strong message. I also am not a fan of Take A Bow which should have been replaced with the amazing You'll See or Fever as mentioned above.  Take A Bow went to number 1 so that is why it was included. I like the lyrics to it though.    Most of the songs are Radio Edits and are about 30-45 seconds shorter than the original version. Those songs are Erotica, Deeper and Deeper, Secret, Don't Cry For Me Argetina, Bedtime Story, Ray Of Light,Frozen, Beautful Stranger and Take A Bow. The edits are great to listen and dance to too. The rest of the songs are in their full versions. Don't Cry For Me Argentina from Evita is also included on it and Madonna has never sounded any better. It is the original version and not any remix. Although I must admit that Argentina does not really fit the album but is there for her fans. I am glad she included Beautiful Stranger and Drowned World Substitute For Love both great songs produced by William Orbit. If your a fan of Ray Of Light, Music, and Bedtime Stories than I would highly recommend this album !!I can't wait for the next album this year. Confessions On A Dance Floor November 2005!!
0790732254|4.0|The drama \\"Who's Afraid Of Virginia Woolf\\" by Edward Albee deals with the conflicts between two couples: Martha (52) & George (46) and Honey (26) and Nick (28). It plays in the house of Martha and George after a party at Martha's father where the couple met Honey and Nick. During this night they drink very much alcohol and play games like \\"Humiliate the Host\\" and \\"Get the Guests\\". With these games they just hurt each other. <br />This drama expresses the difficulties in the partnership of Martha and George. Especially in the film the actors Elizabeth Taylor (Martha) and Richard Burton (George) show how big their problems are. <br />In my opinion the film is very well done. All actors fit into their role and play it very convincing. They also look and behave like it is described in the book. The film is very close to the book except for one scene in the car and then in the bar. <br />On the whole I can say that I enjoyed reading the book and watching the film because it is an interesting sad story with many funny elements. <br />
0375751513|5.0|This is an APOLOGIA (I suppose) to Oscar Wilde on behalf of all those who rated his wonderful book lowly. It just so happens to be my favorate book, and I looked so see if there was anyone who didn't like it. Quite horrified, and rather losing my faith in Humanity (or HUMANITAD) I thought: I must write an essay myself!<br /><br />To be honest, I am sure that dear old Oscar would not have been terribly upset some people didn't like his book, for his works are, let's be honest, only truly understood by those who share something of his divine temprement (like me!).<br /><br />Let me now say why I like it.<br /><br />I first read the picture when I was at school (vague memories of having written a review for this book before, have I?) - and, quite honestly, it is the most beautiful and cleverset thing in the world (bookwise).<br /><br />Heaens above, if you can't enjoy a book that is so obviously about pleasure (in a very Epicurean, spiritual way, ye moral detractors, mark you!), what are you doing engaging in the Epicurean pleasure of reading at all? Give up! You do not have a soul to be corrupted!
B000001F75|5.0|This one took the most time to digest, first of all I noticed the high bass and kinda different vocal style compared to the later ones . Also the song structure was different, leaning towards blues than the more rock style they adopted for the later ones. All these made for a very deep album, and one that will make you concentrate on the music and lyrics. I'm glad I let it sink in cuz now it easily outshines any other Lizzy album, including the classic ones.

B000002J1L|5.0|Greetings, to all. <br /> <br />    I bought this album (as well as FOXTROT) when it came out in the 70's.  I bought it because I was intrigued by the amazing and wonderful artwork on the album cover.  However, these early vinyl recodings were just awful as far as recording quality; they were so scratchy and distorted that they were really difficult to listen to. <br /> <br />    When these recordings appeared on cd, I was finally able to realize what a great recording this (and FOXTROT) is. <br /> <br />    Filled with wonderful poetry and delicate music, this album must be listened to over and over to get its full beauty. <br /> <br />    The musicians come together as a well organized symbiosis of style texturing and moving emotions. <br /> <br />    My two favorite songs here, are: HARLEQUIN and THE FOUNTAIN OF SALMACIS (the story of Hermaphroditus put to song).  HARLEQUIN is a madrigal-like tune which is touching and beautiful.  SALMACIS is an excellent song to wrap this album up; it all comes together at the end with a wonderful, epic sound that few other groups can produce. <br /> <br />   Genesis, with Mr. Gabriel at the helm, was a wonderful group, one of the best, really.  The amazing thing about all of these early Genesis albums, is that they just seem to get better with repeated listenings. <br /> <br />    Do yourself a musical/poetic favor, and pick up NURSERY CRYME and FOXTROT soon.  They will stay with you forever! <br /> <br />Rock On, Kids, <br />Dr. Of Style
0670033693|5.0|I recently visited Wyoming and found this book to be an accurate and vivid description of this part of the country. The author describes views and scenes in such detail that I can feel the snowflakes as they fall. Throughout the book, I felt as if the sheriff was by my side recounting the tale of his past year. The characters come to life in such a way that I came to my own conclusion about the mystery...incorrectly. As a result of reading this book, I have a renewed interest in Native Americans, mysteries and the history of guns. I am also planning a return trip to Sheridan, Wyoming...but not in the winter.
1401300901|4.0|I bought this book at the airport, thinking it was going to be awful.  I enjoyed this book so much I read it in a week.  I was sitting on the beach in Canaries crying my eyes out, so much so that I had to take off my sunglasses and dry my eyes.  I was there on a girlie holiday with my mam and sister.  My mam though there was someghing wrong with me!  It is an excellent book and would highly recommend it.
B00005JNJ7|5.0|TEAM AMERICA is the foulest, dirtiest, most rude and obnoxious and ABSOLUTELY HILARIOUS movie I have ever seen.  The great thing about the film is that it is absolutely heedless of who it offends or takes shots at.  And believe me, it has something offensive for everyone. <br /> <br />In short, it details the misadventures of a group of anti-terrorist Americans, working out of a supersecret  homebase in the middle of Mt. Rushmore.  These gung-ho heroes hunt down terrorists wherever they find them.  In the opening sequence, the team descends on Paris to wipe out some terrorists with a WMD in a briefcase.  While they DO take out the terrorists, they also manage to destroy the Eiffel Tower, the Louvre and the Arch d Triumphe.  Certainly they do more damage to Paris than the bomb in the suitcase.  Later, they destroy the Pyramids and the Sphinx stopping another group of terrorists.  The point is obviously that these deeply right-wing nuts are alienating the world, blundering into situations without regard for consequences, etc. etc.  So, we think the movie is bashing the supposedly extremist Bush-administration. <br /> <br />But then, when we learn the Kim Jong Il of North Korea has a huge plan for basically disrupting all of civilization (mostly so he gets a little attention), the tables turn - very pointedly making fun of all the celebrities and their peace-mongering.  Alec Baldwin, Tim Robbins, George Clooney and on and on are shown as knee-jerk liberals who can't even make a cogent case against Team America...except to say something about \\"big corporations.\\" <br /> <br />So the creators of the movie play fair...everyone is skewered.  Although I would have to say that in the end, the left wing is more soundly skewered, primarily because all the celebrities are dispatched in the most horrifically violent and amusing ways possible.   <br /> <br />Among other joys are the most lengthy and graphic projectile vomiting in film history (giving Monty Python's The Meaning ofLife a run for its money), a very graphic sex scene, and some wonderful songs that make fun of everything from Michael Bay's PEARL HARBOR to the current wave of country-western pro-American songs.   <br /> <br />Oh, and of course, it's all done with puppets.  This makes virtually every clich the movie indulges in very funny instead of clichd.  (Hey, he's giving a clichd \\"rah-rah\\" speech...but he's a puppet, so it's funny.) <br /> <br />My wife and I (both in our early 40s) had tears running down our faces during much of this movie.  It's so over-the-top, so shocking and yet so right on the money about most of the subjects it pokes fun at.  To really enjoy it, I think, you have to have some idea of current affairs.  If you don't understand that during the last election, a big group of celebrities worked really hard to prevent Bush from being reelected, you might wonder why all these celebrities go to North Korea.  If you don't know who Hans Blix, the UN weapons inspector, is...you won't understand the scene he's in.   <br /> <br />Also, folks, please don't take little kids to this.  It's packed with so much cussing, so much racist humor, so much graphic sex and so much adult humor (in the best possible sense), that I really think a 10-year old might be scarred for life!  But if you're an older teen or an adult with a strong stomach...have a great time.  This movie is certainly in my top 5 movies of 2004, and in my top 20 best comedies of all time.  (And I don't even like South Park much.) <br />
B000063147|4.0|I don't understand all the people calling A7X hardcore, punk and/or emo.  Aside from occasional tinges of the former which crop up, this album is metal, plain and simple.  Ironic how bands like Korn and Linkin Park get to usurp and collectively soil the banner of metal, yet when a band comes along that deserves the title, no one gives it! <br /> <br />True enough that there are a few punk-ish passages to be heard on this album, and the singer's vocals hover somewhere between a black metal rasp and hardcore yelling; but the total package comes off sounding much more like something out of Gothenburg Sweden than something from the states. <br /> <br />At any rate, whatever people insist upon calling them, A7X is a blissful breath of fresh air into the local erm... \\"heavy rock\\" secene.  Hopefully more bands will follow their example and put down the DJs, learn how to write a guitar melody, and discover how to carry a tune.
B00004R99K|3.0|I purchased this movie for my daughter for Christmas and was delighted with the movie it's self but the tape qulity was faulty or old. The movie will flicker back and forth between color and black and white. VERY IRRITATING! The cover had poor qulity for being a \\"New Movie\\" it had aged plastic(yellow and brittle) not sure how long this copy had sat on the shelf before it got sent to me?
0780622553|5.0|One word, Wow.<br /><br />What a visually stunning film from a director of one of the best movies of all time, The Crow! An incredible story packed with visually stunning cinematography, special effects and an original story. I honestly never thought Alex Proyas would be able to top The Crow on a visual level but he certainly did, although I cannot compare The Crow to Dark City on a story based level, Dark City was more visually stunning than the crow but we also have to keep in mind when The Crow was made. Don't get me wrong, The Crow is one of my favorite movies but the Dark City also deserves a lot of credit for it's originality, visual triumph, and ability to let the mind wonder away into the world of unknown during the movie.<br /><br />I will definitely watch this movie over and over again simply because it is just that good. Seeing that is came out in 1998, it still puzzles me how this movie did not become a cult classic just yet. It seems as if the audiences still don't know about this great movie so I am hoping that some of you that read this will go out and rent this puppy. I realize I am not getting too deep into the plot structure and what the movie is really about but there is a good reason why I am doing that. If I start it off I will ruin the whole movie for you so it is best that you go out, rent this and enjoy it for yourself. If you are a fan of Blade Runner/The Matrix/The Crow or any other movie bordering these three, you will enjoy Dark City. Go!
B0001HAHXW|1.0|Robert Johnson and Eric Clapton are two artists that I can listen to in small doses. I respect Johnson's role as one of the great bluesmen, but the \\"old-school\\" acoustic blues sound doesn't do much for me. And Eric Clapton, while an above-average musician with respect for his influences, is remarkably overrated especially given that he hasn't produced anything notable since his one-shot with Derek And The Dominoes in 1970 (mention Tears In Heaven to me and I will gag uncontrollably).<br /><br />Slowhand falls into the typical \\"white blues\\" pattern--he knows how to PLAY the blues from a technical standpoint, but it's only a slick, drab incarnation that lacks passion, grit, and feeling--the very essence of the blues.<br /><br />I'm of the opinion that if you're going to cover an old blues tune, either keep it generally as faithful as you can to the original or just take a page from the Page/Hendrix handbook and go completely over-the-top--it may annoy purists, but at least the emotion is there. Eric plays to the middle of the road, which leaves purists bemoaning the lack of real blues feeling but doesn't give rock fans much of a hook either. As a result, Me & Mr. Johnson comes off as a boring tribute to a influential bluesman, with no risks or interesting interpretations to be found.<br /><br />The performances are about as exciting as watching paint dry in all departments (except for Jerry Portnoy's annoyingly busy harmonica). Bland guitarwork, vocals with about as much passion as an android, staid drumming... it's just overwhelmingly BLAH. Not bad enough to even be notable.<br /><br />If you want to hear great modern covers of Robert Johnson done tastefully but with genuine soul, try Peter Green's Robert Johnson Songbook. If you want to hear some hot Clapton, pick up his work with The Bluesbreakers and Layla And Other Assorted Love Songs by Derek And The Dominoes, and avoid the easy-listening FM dreck that Clapton's late career is full to brimming with (which includes this album). And of course, you can't go wrong with anything by B.B. King, Buddy Guy, Muddy Waters, Albert King, John Lee Hooker, Howlin' Wolf, SRV, etc.(which includes this album). And of course, you can't go wrong with anything by B.B. King, Buddy Guy, Muddy Waters, Albert King, John Lee Hooker, Howlin' Wolf, SRV, etc.
B000002KBA|5.0|After playing a little with every kind of cool rock style known to the mankind at that point, Ritchie Blackmore and friends have finally found their niche. I am mentioning Ritchie here by name 'cause without him this was not going to happen. He is so blisteringly fast here you can be sure that fans were just fainting in droves during concerts just looking at him or at home listening to this record and trying to mentally fathom how the heck does he move his fingers... \\"Speed King\\" simply blows you away - even nowadays; and try to imagine how that must have sounded to unsuspecting listeners in 1972. Then you have absolutely stunning \\"Child in Time\\" and \\"Into the Fire\\"... still causes my eyes to water upon remembering the first time I heard this and thought to myself \\"this is freaking amazing... what kind of music is that and why have I never heard stuff like that before\\". As it is well-known, DP is not as famous in the States as Black Sabbath which together with Led Zeppelin is generally credited with creating heavy metal since they started doing this in 1969 when DP was still trying on psychedelic and generic blues-rock while only rarely venturing into hard rock. I still think that this is very different from BS and LZ debuts and reason is simple - music style. It is quite different from both Black Sabbath eponymous first disc and from Led Zeppelin's debut. in my humble opinion, BS was never very exciting musically - they just went relentlessly ahead with their metal satanomania and very dark lyrics and very dark music which, again, was never very (with rare exceptions, of course) catchy or singable (is that even a word?) by an ordinary person. Try and hum to yourself anything from Black Sabbath or Paranoid and see if that will give you any pleasure. As for Led Zeppelin tunes, they were of course quite on par with DP in terms of music quality but they were so much deeper than DP into blues-based hard rock and that profoundly defined their style. The purple boys on the other hand were never too beholden to any particular style of hard rock - that's not to say they were rootless but they used this and that and also that and had they still been going strong in 1977 I am sure they'd put some disco in their hard-rockers without much shame or hesitation. That's why it is such a pleasure to listen to them - you can hear blues influences and some country too, and rock-n-roll is there of course, and art rock with progrock as well is being served to you full strength, and don't forget about psychedelia and folk-rock. The only thing they were missing was sense of humor in their straight-face rock-n-roll-is-sex-and-drugs-and-partying-all-night lyrics but then you can't really have it all... and that was their downfall together with the other classic bands when punks came and killed all of the old gods in 1979.
B00001QEE8|5.0|This is my favorite of all the Disney animated movies.  The combination of voice talent, good music, and the quality of the story all combine to make it a near perfect movie.      \\"The Jungle Book\\" is Rudyard Kipling's story of Mowgli, a boy raised by the wolves in the jungles of India.  Mowgli cavorts with his buddies Balloo, a lazy bum of a bear, and Bagheera, a worry-wort black Panther.  His very menacing enemies are Shere Khan, the tiger, and Kaa, the sibilant python.  It's a child's dream tale of life in the jungle, free from the restraints of school and parents and civilization.     The highlights of this movie are nearly endless:  Phil Harris is superb as the laid-back Baloo; George Sanders plays a tiger with upper-class diction and (one suspects) unusual sexual preferences;  Louis Prima belts out a showstopping musical number. The Elephant march is touching, funny, and toe-tapping.  Mowgli himself is a charming, sunny boy.             Mowgli is a forerunner to the likes of Tarzan. It boggles my mind to think of the imagination -- the daydreams -- Kipling must have had to come up with this story.    Smallchief
B000002KHB|5.0|It is kind of disheartening to read about how Deep Purple are under-appreciated and less known than Black Sabbath or Led Zeppelin. I don't think this is true unless you are a 20-year old living in the States. In the rest of the world DP enjoys huge commercial success and enormous crowds of fans, clubs, cults and whatever... Let's get back to the album and we'll see that every (read my lips: every one of them!) track is at least very good.. and some are masterpieces like \\"Highway Star\\" or \\"Pictures of Home\\" or perennial favorite \\"Smoke on the Water\\" with that famous riff which is by now known to approximately 73 billion people... wait... what... oh! I meant 74 billion of course, then. Kidding aside, this is no Blue Oyster Cult for you buddy - this is hard and heavy and loud and oh goodness even with jams and big chunks of progressive artsiness through in for the good measure in \\"Lazy\\" and \\"Space Truckin'\\". I probably listened to this at least 15 times during first 3 months of my proud ownership of that precious piece of vinyl called LP. Go do the same right now! and when you get back check out other albums by Jon Lord and colleagues.
B0000VAFO0|2.0|How do you screw up a movie about werewolves battling against vampires.  Watch this movie and you'll find out how.  Where this movie goes wrong is by trying to include too much plot content involving too many characters and presented to the audience all in the wrong order.  By the end of the movie you actually understand what is going on, but just spent the whole movie not really sure of which side you were routing for.  The thing I hated about this movie is that it actually had solid potential and the story was even a good one.  The movie was very stylish and had above average special effects and decent action scenes. <br /> <br />That there was one of the big problems in the movie.  They spent too much time making the movie look good and stylish.  The producers were aiming for a cultish flavored hit and at least with me failed.  Watching the main chick vampire spend half the movie simply strutting tomboyishly around with an attitude that left a frost behind her, just doesn't do it for me.  By the end I could give a crap if she lived or died, in fact I found myself not caring about any of the characters let alone like any of them.  I will say that had they told the story in a different order, and from the beginning at least hinted behind some of the plot reasons for why this war was raging, I could probably have enjoyed it a whole lot more, only due to the fact that I'd know roughly who was good and who was bad. <br /> <br />This movie tries to be one part American Werewolf in Paris, one part Blade, one part The Matrix and turns out a stale example of mediocrity.  Anyone interested in getting a Blade knockoff fix would be better served watching something like Van Helsing.
0385720920|5.0|Chuch Palahniuk has captured the true essence of being a sex addict.  He accurately describes the mental games and justification of all sexual acting out.  What's more he explains how the addict got that way.  A true treasure to read.
0767834739|2.0|Sorry guys, bear with me, this is a long review, but if you want to know why I gave two stars you will have to read the entire thing. <br /> <br />Let me first state that unlike many people, especially fans of the Resident Evil game series, I thoroughly enjoyed the first Resident Evil movie and although it wasn't anything too special or original, I felt the it was a solid action/sci-fi/zombie/horror movie which never really went wrong.  RE - Apocalpyse however disappointed me numerous times.  I excepted a generic plot, I expected Matrix style action, I expected hordes of zombies, I expected a lot of things, what I didn't expect were some lame scenes and a lazy plot wrap up. <br /> <br />The gist of the story is that a zombie creating virus has infected the Umbrella Corporation's secret research facility known as The Hive which resides underneath the city of Racoon City (the events of the first movie).  Of course a science team goes to reopen the Hive and the bad stuff escapes, no problem there.  All of Racoon City starts to get infected and all kinds of zombie hell is breaking out everywhere.  Alice our main character wakes up in a \\"hospital\\" after her ordeal from the first movie.  By the time she walks outside the city is already officially screwed. <br /> <br />First the things I liked about the movie, I love the Resident theme, I like the action/fighting scenes, I generally like the characters and the acting, there aren't too many lame quotes, there are some decently frightening scenes and the special effects are about as good as you could ask for. <br /> <br />Now what I didn't like.  *SPOILERS*  Some how Umbrella Corporation in less than 24 hours managed to contain the outbreak within a city seamingly the size of Chicago using 30+ foot walls around the entire city.  Allrighty then, in all fairness the Umbrella Corporation knew the virus had infected the Hive, so prior to entering The Hive they could have and should have had safety measures ready to be deployedif the virus escaped into the city.  Okay I guess I can buy that. <br /> <br />There were naturally a couple of scenes that were lame or dumb, such as Alice jumping via motorcycle into the church where the other characters are battling against some Lurkers, not knowing where she was going to land and who she might squish on the other side.  A little bit reckless, but I'll forgive it as a theatrical flair.  And of course if a zombie/undead resurrecting virus gets lose one of the first things you would put on your site seeing list is a stroll through the cemetary, right?  Well our characters did, and of course the buried zombies don't crawl out of their graves until our characters are right dead smack in the middle of the cemetary.  Sigh... well every horror movie has to have the character stupidity moments and maybe the buried zombies didn't have enough willpower to dig themselves out until they started to smell fresh blood standing right on top of them.  All right I'll forgive that stuff. <br /> <br />Then a semi-side plot to whole movie is the conflict between Alice and Nemesis (a huge T-virus mutant).  The Umbrella Corporation wants to see the two battle it out and test each other.  Allright so the two have a couple semi-random encounters which were actually kinda cool, but then we get towards the end of the movie and their \\"battle\\" has yet to resolve itself.  So we can't have that.  Rather than have to two stumble across/find each other in some random cool location and end it, an Umbrella Corporation scientist forces the two to literally fight now.  \\"You and you step forward and end this.\\"  I thought for a second I'd stumbled into a \\"Mortal Kombat\\" movie, I expected at anytime to hear the deep gravely voice utter the word FIGHT.  Needless to say the scene was lame.  Once again however ultimately forgivable due to artistic license. <br /> <br />Now we come to the end.  A horrible disease ravaged a city the size of Chicago, a huge 30 ft wall is erected around the entire city (we are talking miles and miles of wall), newspapers lay scattered through the streets with headlines reading \\"THE DEAD WALK\\", people struggle to escape the city and many do before Umbrella Corporation puts a stop to it.  To cover this tragedy up Umbrella Corporation touches off a nuclear bomb and claims the power plant had a meltdown.  Fine no problem. <br /> <br />However, some amateur footage of the zombie tragedy ends up in the hands of mainstream news.  Reports of disturbing and shocking footage are aired.  Oh, wait sorry, never mind the whole thing was just a hoax.  All we know is that Racoon City was leveled by a nuclear meltdown.  WHAT?  Are you trying to tell me no one in the outside public knew about this outbreak?  No one noticed the 30 ft wall surrounding a major metropolis?  Newspapers had enough time to release breaking news headlines reading \\"THE DEAD WALK\\" and nobody outside heard about it or read these articles?  None of the presumably thousands of earlier escapees told anyone about the tragedy?  None of the remaining people not to mention the reporting local news, government or law enforcement groups made a phone call to the outside world to report what was happening and/or ask for aid and/or say there goodbyes to loved ones, especially in the early hours of the outbreak?  How in the world am I supposed to buy that crap? <br /> <br />If you want a cover story say terrorists released a biological/viral disease and before anyone could figure out what was going on, the nuclear plant had a meltdown and obliterated the entire city and any potential explaination of the virus outbreak.  There both horrible tragedies reported and simply explained and resolved.  But no instead the outside world remains completely ignorant of the zombie disease outbreak. Please.  That my friends is why I didn't like this movie.  It makes the whole plot resolution unbelievable.
B00006CXXU|5.0|This is Christina's best album so far. No kidding if you still haven't got it you HAVE to get it!!
0553382179|3.0|I love the \\"Flylady\\" and her system.  I was introduced to her this summer (6mo ago) and have been visiting her website and getting her daily emails.  I found the book contained almost the same info as I had been getting for FREE online.  I recommend going to the website and save your money.  Her whole plan is babysteps.  I like how the babysteps are presented online better.  I don't have the time to read the book and then try to implement the ideas.

0887306101|5.0|All losers want to lose and all winners who fall short of their goals are fulfilling some inner need for a constrained threshold of success...<br /><br />  This book is the Bible of trading, speculating and investing. After all, if you strongly wish to become a better market professional or dramatically improve your trading results, who'd better teach you about the market than the best of the best?<br /><br />  There are many pearls of wisdom in this book, like risk management, money management, losing being part of the game, the driving desire to become a successful trader, having confidence, taking trading very seriously, etc, etc. The part I liked the most was the one about finding a methodology that works for the individual and remaining true to that approach. One of the traders who offered trading courses failed a student simply because to the question \\"If you are convinced about taking a position in the market, do you still take it if you find out that I (I being the trader offering the trading courses) have already taken a completely contrarian position?\\", he answered \\"No\\"!<br /><br />  If you want to become a successful trader and you think that reading a dozen books about the market is the way to start, than this book HAS to be one of them.
B0000AZKL7|4.0|This is a classic jazz masterpiece that requires no further compliments. I'm happy with the slight but recognizable improvement in the sound quality that SACD layer offers. Thanks to the lower background noise level (could be lower than what the original master tape contains, thanks to DSD remastering technology), the music contained in the SACD layer sounds deeper and more transparent.   <br />For marketing purposes, I understand the merits of hybrid discs for newly recorded materials. But people who unmistakably buy this SACD (knowing this is a SACD disc) have a SACD player, plus CD and/or LP of the same title which they have played over and over with sheer admiration. Those with only CD players buy CDs, not SACD/CD hybrid discs for a lot more price. So what's the need for the CD layer whose sound quality does not match previously released JVC's K-2 or XRCD coded CDs. This holds true for all the classic masterpiece hybrid discs produced by Analogue Productions. Delete the CD layer and reduce the price.
0446343129|5.0|Though I've read this book sometime ago, it became required reading when I took my junior year health course, along with Diet & Nutrition by Rudolph Ballentine and a standard physiology and anatomy book. <br /> <br />I can't believe how popular this book gets as the years go by! It's so amazing, I think I'm getting more optimistic about the future of human health! Yes, there still are disbelievers about the \\"evils\\" of sugar (though I'm not spouting that). Eh..like with any thing, disbelievers, you gotta try out things. So if you think Dufty's full of you know what, first knock off sugar for a while and then make your assumptions.
B0002LU8OU|5.0|I was hooked on this album by an ultra-hip friend back in 1985 (a little late, but then I'm like that with music....).  It sounded (and still does) like nothing else around, the lyrics were intelligent, quirky, and ceaselessly engaging, and it's makers did not shy from the elegance of string arrangements.  In fact, it could be argued that this album almost single-handedly wrested the orchestra back from the schmatlz meisters and made it hip again.  One of my other all-time favorites, \\"The Lexicon of Love\\" by new romantic northern soul outfit ABC, had two short years before launched the singularly talented Ann Dudley into the pop arranging world.   (NOTE- that also-incomparable work was given the \\"Deluxe\\" treatment by Universal  at the end of 2004) .  While Martyn Fry of ABC had shared a witty, quirky, and self-consciously-literate approach to lyrics with our Mr. Cole, the styles of the two groups were markedly different.  In theory,  that could certainly test the scope and flexibility of an arranger.  Ms. Dudley's work on both albums is sublime and is in both cases a major ingredient in their respective successes.   <br /> <br />Though the album was reported  by critics at time of it's release to be country-influenced, the music herein is respectably informed and defies categorization other than that bastard moniker \\"alternative rock\\".   Obvious influences on composition and playing run the gamut from Glen Campbell/Jimmy Webb, Chet Atkins, and Duane Eddy through  to Jimmy Smith, Bob Dylan and Bo Diddley.  One of the awesome things about the newly mastered original album is that  new subtleties are apparent in the recordings and these very subtleties are distinguishing the songs stylistically  to a much greater extent than I remember from my much-played, much-treasured vinyl copy.  In fact, it is a credit to the producer (Paul Hardiman) that these songs hold together so effortlessly in this collection!  The most obvious \\"odd man out\\" here is \\"Patience\\",  a take on frustrated love and/or personal shortcomings that utitlizes a Bacharach-influenced approach in it's recording as well as string arrangement.  It could easily fit with an R&B set, and Lloyd allowed himself to sound not only vulnerable but pretty as well.  Somehow it fits in with the rest, don't ask me...  I chalk it up to a sparing approach in the rhythm section and Lloyd's singular voice.  In any case, I love the damn song and am no longer embarrased to say so.  <br /> <br />  \\"Are You Ready to Be Heartbroken?\\", \\"Perfect Skin\\" , and \\"Forest Fire\\" have all received airplay in the Uk and are known to fans who've purchased \\"Lloyd Cole and the Commotions 1984-89\\" (RIP), so let me add that EVERY track on this gem is a winner!  In fact, I like a couple non-hit album tracks here substantially more than those mentioned.  \\"2CV\\" is simple, haunting and gorgeous, \\"Speedboat\\" is menacing and haunting and somewhat enigmatic in it's story of an on-the-edge couple and their never-mentioned demise.  With \\"Four Flights Up\\" we get a witty Dylan-inspired take on what could be any couple, but the tongue-in-cheek (I think...) melodrama of the narrator makes it sound like the most doomed relationship on Earth.  On that note I have to add that Lloyd the lyricist offers dense and slippery tellings that often are not what they seem  (or are they?).  Lyrics you can chew on for years with instant, often dark,  humour and hooks as accessible as trouble... <br /> <br />The second disc here offers an  assortment of demos, live recordings, bbc session recordings, and Mr. Cole's much-rated b-sides, almost always top-of-the-line material that makes you wonder how they ever decided in the first place.  For that matter we get commentary from all of the band on just that very subject  (and others) in the substantial c.d. booklet, along with rare original photos from the period.  While \\"Rattlesnakes\\"  (nicknamed a \\"student bedsit classic\\") will probably never get a \\"straight\\" following, it indeed gets are-tailoring worthy of Armani while retaining all of it's original swagger.  <br /> <br /> I recommend for ANYONE who loves music!
B0002OERI0|5.0|ive liked green day ever since a little after insomniac came out.  when i heard brain stew on the radio i thought it was badass for a punk band.  at first i hated this album because it was so popular when it was released. i hated the title track american idiot.  i never bought this cd but i burnt it on to my computer and i listen to it frequently because its pretty good.  yes it is better than warning but no better than nimrod.  i also hate people who now like green day because of american idiot and now is there favorite band. ive liked green day for almost 10 years ... 10 years i am a long time green day fan ive seen them live twice (once on there warning tour and american idiot).  they are a great band to see live but the only problem was they played alot of there new material.  so i recommend going to see green day if u really like this cd because chances are theyll probably play all the songs from this cd excluding 2 or 3.  by the way i dont normally listen to pop/punk but green day is an exception.
B0000C0FJB|5.0|Call them the Grateful Living.<br /><br />For almost entirely opposite reasons, Neil Peart and Robert Hunter are two of my favorite rock lyricists, and Rush and the Dead are two of my favorite bands. The contrasts between them are obvious, but one thing they have in common is that each of them has deliberately attempted, with at least intermittent success, to achieve a measure of self-transcendence through their music.<br /><br />The difference is that whereas the Dead tried to do it through 'ego-death' (aided by under-the-counter pharmaceuticals that in several cases helped to render them biologically dead as well), Rush does it consciously, intellectually, and 'individualistically', keeping their egos intact, healthy, and sane in the process. (And not coincidentally, their songs themselves tend to involve themes like individual liberty and responsibility, self-reliance, intellectual achievement, the extreme coolness of technology, and admiration for competence and innovation.)<br /><br />That's one of many reasons why it's fascinating to listen to this CD of their concert in Rio de Janeiro. In this blistering show, they extend their ego-preserving self-transcendence to a crowd of 40,000. Everyone participates, and all of them become 'part of something bigger' without loss to themselves. And you can _hear_ it -- and get involved in it yourself -- because the recording engineers were careful to leave _in_ the sounds of the audience. They're very much a part of the show, and their participation is a vivid reply to the anti-intellectual folks in the peanut gallery who for so long have criticized Rush's music as 'intellectual' and 'soulless'.<br /><br />I've written in other reviews that even at their 'proggiest', Rush have always managed to keep their music accessible and engaging to even the casual listener. Nothing brings that point home like listening to them perform two of their best-known (and musically difficult) instrumentals ('YYZ' and 'La Villa Strangiato') with forty thousand crazy Brasileiros _singing along_ as though the guys were playing 'Margaritaville'.<br /><br />The musical performances at this show are good, too -- in some cases magisterial. (I particularly like these versions of 'Red Sector A', 'Dreamline', 'Driven', 'The Pass', 'Bravado', and 'Roll the Bones', which are among my favorite Rush songs anyway. And of course the _Vapor Trails_ stuff was still fresh at the time of this recording.) There's a lovely acoustic version of 'Resist' and some hilarious musical comedy during 'La Villa Strangiato' as Alex cuts up. (At one point Geddy and Neil even perform a brief excerpt from 'The Girl from Ipanema'.)<br /><br />Be prepared for some of their older material to sound a wee bit different from their versions on _All the World's A Stage_: Alex plays these with his current wall-of-noise guitar sound, and a couple of early pieces (notably '2112', from which they perform 'Overture' and 'The Temples of Syrinx') have been dropped a step and a half so that Geddy doesn't have to reach for those high notes. They're still _good_; they just don't sound exactly like they did when I was in junior high.<br /><br />(Also be careful with the cardboard CD cover. As other reviewers have noted, taking the CDs in and out of the sleeves can scratch them. You may want to buy jewel cases for these.)<br /><br />This is a great show and a really good recording of it. Recommended to all Rush fans.iros _singing along_ as though the guys were playing 'Margaritaville'.    The musical performances at this show are good, too -- in some cases magisterial. (I particularly like these versions of 'Red Sector A', 'Dreamline', 'Driven', 'The Pass', 'Bravado', and 'Roll the Bones', which are among my favorite Rush songs anyway. And of course the _Vapor Trails_ stuff was still fresh at the time of this recording.) There's a lovely acoustic version of 'Resist' and some hilarious musical comedy during 'La Villa Strangiato' as Alex cuts up. (At one point Geddy and Neil even perform a brief excerpt from 'The Girl from Ipanema'.)    Be prepared for some of their older material to sound a wee bit different from their versions on _All the World's A Stage_: Alex plays these with his current wall-of-noise guitar sound, and a couple of early pieces (notably '2112', from which they perform 'Overture' and 'The Temples of Syrinx') have been dropped a step and a half so that Geddy doesn't have to reach for those high notes. They're still _good_; they just don't sound exactly like they did when I was in junior high.    (Also be careful with the cardboard CD cover. As other reviewers have noted, taking the CDs in and out of the sleeves can scratch them. You may want to buy jewel cases for these.)    This is a great show and a really good recording of it. Recommended to all Rush fans.
B0002KVUKM|4.0|This movie has excitement galore, although it's budget ignores the point of decreasing marginal returns (if Hollywood every learns this concept they'll stop making movies that cost much more than $100 million, and they'll look just as good as they do now). <br /> <br />Still, while I have no doubt that the original script was brilliant, I think it's evident that the director and editor boiled it down to fit in more action.  Consider the following: <br /> <br />1.  In the opening Van Helsing states that he would rather kill Hyde than take him in alive, as the church.  In the next scene he tell the cardinal how horrible it is the be the one who's there when the monsters die.  INCONSISTENT MODIVATION! <br /> <br />2.  First Frankenstein wants to live, then he wants them to kill him to save the human race just a moment later, then he get's upset about going to Rome where he'll be able to live out of Dracula's grasp and they have to shackle him.  INCONSISTENT MODIVATION! <br /> <br />3.  In an interview with Kate Beckinsale she claimed that the brides of Dracula became jealous of her when they realized Dracula wanted to bite her.  By the time he showed signs of wanting to bite her two of the brides were dead and the third showed no sign of even knowing Dracula wanted to bite her.  The only thing they seemed to feel for her was the same playfulness they felt for all humans.  CLEAR-CUT EDIT! <br /> <br />So why four stars?  First of all the effects are breathtaking.  And secondly the acting is top-knotch.  In fact the actors are SO good that they can make you believe in the characters, even when their modivations make no sense.
B0002Z0EYA|2.0|Hard to keep a straight face watching this one.  It feels like we've retrograded back to 50's Hollywood - clean, modern Americans with lots of hair gel, starched denim tunics, and heavy plastic necklaces parading around as warriors.  I keep waiting for Burt Lancaster to show up somewhere; for Kirk Douglas to arrive on a chariot; for Charlton Heston with a Big Beard to trek down from the hills.  I don't care if it's historically accurate - if only it would carry me away with the story it chooses to tell.   As for watching it strictly as an action movie, well, there's better stuff to choose from.  And, we won't even touch the topic of the dialog.  Too bad, waste of the talented Pitt and Bloom, but I'm sure they'll go on to better shows.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|Vol. 3 the subliminal verses is a phenominal music composition.  It has hard rock but then also has some acoustic guitar songs on the repetoir.  It is one of the top three albums one can buy right now.  It is nominated for several grammy's and very well deservedly so.  Shazam!!
B00068IOWC|3.0|It's funny how each new U2 album requires detailed discussion, usually quite polar in nature. But it's testament to their ability, their place in music history and their relevance to modern society that this is the case. The question is, is \\"How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb\\" their greatest album, as according to Bono?  <br /> <br />U2 is my favourite band of all time. So I can say that Atomic Bomb is not U2's best album, nor is it near the top of U2's discography. I wish it was life changing, but unfortunately it only manages to show the band's age. After being saturated with the first single Vertigo, which increadibly is one of the better songs, there is little left to get excited about. There are some excellent songs; for example, the hopeful Miracle Drug; the typical U2 of City of Blinding Lights; the mature student-mentor discourse of Man and a Woman; and the preachy Crumbs from your Table. But, the reason why Atomic Bomb isn't their best is that there isn't much else of note on the album and it declines considerably with the last three tracks. Great albums leave you wanting more at the end of the final track. Atomic bomb fizzes out. <br /> <br />This demonstrates that U2's magic is disappearing. Apart from the above disappointment, it is the first time on an album that Bono sounds old. Maybe this is due to the strain of his father dying - the main theme Bono investigates through his lyrics on the album. So this would come as no suprise if you have seen any footage of their previous tour; Bono struggles at Slane Castle and in Boston. Bono's comments that this is U2's best ever album are far from the truth. Maybe he feels as though he has reached closure. <br /> <br />However, the bonus DVD is excellent. I always love U2's promotional footage which we get at the beginning of the DVD which then swings into a 20 minute documentary on the writing of the songs contained on the DVD, showing through their instruments how the songs developed. The chapters of the DVD runthrough a 'studio performance' (mimed) of Sometimes You Can't Make it on Your Own, a live version of Crumbs From Your Table, acoustic versions of Vertigo and Sometimes You Can't Make it on Your Own, and a mimed studio version of Vertigo which has some amazing camera work where Bono in the middle of the group is occasionally slowed down while the others are playing at normal speed. The DVD is definitely worth it. <br /> <br />Only time will tell how good this CD is. I'm hoping that with subsequent single releases we get a better picture of where Atomic Bomb sits. This certainly isn't the end of the road for U2, but they may require another inspirational change of direction to maintain their status as the greatest group in the world.
630503723X|4.0|If you are a sex loving couple looking for some \\"lustful voyerism\\" before pounding each other silly...but you don't want the usual XXX (boring) porn...this may be a film for you.    It has all of the magic of the other, successful, mid-1970's Euro erotica films...the music is haunting and stays with you long after your last orgasim has been completed.  I particularly enjoyed the theme of \\"a middle-aged couple\\" befriending a young, naive, 18 year old French girl.... and for what else? To de-flower her and then have 3-way sex with her while on vacation with her in Bali!    This film has serious female \\"bi-sexuality\\" in it....it portrays a theme I believe most middle aged women, in their hearts, truly desire.  You get to see Emmanuelle passionately kissing and making love to a variety of men and women....all done very tastfully and erotically.  As opposed to showing two totally naked people, baring their obscene \\"shaven\\" genitals and finally \\"spooing\\" all over each others faces.    I'd forgotten how many young women had beautiful pubic hair on their genitals, back in the 1970's...until you see this film...perhaps you had forgotten too.  I recommend this film for \\"horny middle aged couples\\" whose wives are secretly \\"bi-sexual beasts\\" ready to drip all over the couch, while they watch beautiful French women masterbating or getting a nude bubble bath from many stunning, petite, Chinese bathhouse [...].    The only thing keeping me from rating this film 5 stars is the rather weak story line....and the toned down sexuality between the stars.  If you want a little more sexual tension and realistic \\"S&M style\\" floggings, in your old Euro-porn films...try \\"The Story of O\\" or even better, \\"The Image\\"...Those are two 5 star recommendations.
B00003CX9E|4.0|Citizen Kane is like no other movie I have ever seen before. Its about a newspaper tycoon , a very powerful man who inherits riches from his family and then goes into the newspaper business. It corrupts him. Makes him forget about the feelings of those around him. Though he says he cares he only cares about himself and the way others make him feel. The older he gets his world just starts coming apart due to the actions and mistakes he made on his part. The begining of the film he says rosebud and at the end we get to find out what rosebud is. It tells us everything yet tells us nothing at all at the same time. You have to think what exactly it could have meant and why. That one simple thing could have stood out before he died and the simple things in life. The meaning , etc.. I dont know many my age who could probably sit through Citizen Kane and follow it. Im 22 years old. It is very long and it might be boring to some my age. It was made in 41. I noticed the great camera shots and scenes throughout the movie. Orson was gifted to write , direct and star in such a good movie at such an early age. I admire the camera work and plot of the movie but I just wished they wouldve told us more about Rosebud and explained. But then again maybe that would take away from the movie , I think its meant to leave us with mystery about rosebud and to actually think about it. Serious film buffs will love this movie. The one reviewer called it an ( aquired taste). So I Would definetly rent this before you buy. I bought it cause I wanted to see the greatest movie of all time instead i watched and felt a diffrent feeling. I wouldnt say this is the greatest movie ive ever seen but I can see the merit of it. 4 stars.
B0006A9FMI|5.0|The optical motions of buildings and people are at an extreme.Complete with blur effect which occurs on objects that are near when cameras are focused far make the visuals the best yet.Visually its the most detailed and luminous graphics and animation to date.Lets not forget the storyline. One of the most compelling story lines in anime to date.The only thing I didn't like was the need to read subtitle because it was only in japanese but this fact I won't let diminish my rating because its not the animators falt we don't understand Japanese.
B00005JMAH|1.0|The following views are told by the views of a dissapointed child who had their hopes and imaginations crushed by the terrible ideas in the recent movie, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban; but the DVD features had also contributed to the strenuous amounts of dissapointment to the true, literal fans of Harry Potter and this movie had caused confusion to the non-fans as well, I hope that Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire will not sink as low as Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, These are a few things that caused PoA to be terrible.  <br />1. Harry used a lumos spell in his bedroom at the Dursleys house in Privet Drive, you are not supposed to use magic unless it was an emergency in front of muggles (it was not even in the book).  <br />2. Aunt Marge floated out the door, when in the books, Aunt Marge was supposed to float towards the ceiling (talk about over acting).  <br />3. The Knight Bus contained a shrunken head which was quite annoying, even in the DVD. Dobby was annoying too, but it was needed for the story to continue. Ernie Prang looks like someone's blind grandfatther and Stan Shunpike looked like a hobo or a bum living on the streets, the new hunchback Tom, the innkeeper looks like someone from the Addams' family.  <br />4. Harry was supposed to receive The Monsters Book of Monsters from Hagrid at the Dursleys, but instead he got it in The Leaky Cauldron.  <br />5. Lupin looks like an old man from the 1940's with a very aggrivating mustache.  <br />6. The Sneakeoscope was not even shown in the movie, not even Pigwidgeon, or the owls that came to the Dursleys.  <br />7. Dementors are not supposed to fly, they are suppossed to glide and water is not supposed to freeze when they come near. They are not supposed to chase Harry in the air during the Quidditch game.  <br />8. The new Dumbledore and Trelawney looks like drugged-up hippies from the 1960's and Flitwick looks like a monk from the Dark Ages, what happened to our dear old Flitwick. Cornelius Fudge's new look reminds me of a character from the Twilight Zone or The Outer Limits.  <br />9. New characters that do not even appear in the book suddenly appear in the movie with a much bigger role.  <br />10. Buckbeak looks like a fake chicken and too much time was spent on Buckbeak's Flight, when Harry screamed out with his hands out, it reminded me of Titanic, \\"I'm King of the World.\\".  <br />11. Things are pronounced incorrectly, like Expecto Patronum! and Boggart and Sir Cadogan.  <br />12. The new Fat Lady was more obnoxious and so out of character, she was not supposed to sing. I miss the old Fat Lady from the 1st film, Sir Cadogan barely even had a role in this movie.  <br />13. Students barely wore their robes, the robes made it feel more magical. Instead they wear crappy clothes, this is not a Gap commercial.  <br />14. Draco was not supposed to give Harry an origami bird and neither should there be anyone struck by lightning. Students do not paint there face for a Quidditch game.  <br />15. In the Marauder's showed rooms that did not even exist in the books and it was not supposed to show footsteps, it was only supposed to reveal a dot, and Peter Pettigrew was not supposed to show up on the map when Harry saw it.  <br />16. The Firebolt scene was jumbled-up, looked even more beaten-up than the Nimbus 2000, and did not even show up until the final scene which made me want to vomit.  <br />17. Trelawney's prediction was all wrong and looked fake as if she were going through a seizure.  <br />18. Many parts of the story did not show up in the movie at all, like the argument about Crookshanks and Scabbers, Scabber's true identity, Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs, Hermione purchasing Crookshanks and the books for the courses she was taking through her birthday money that her parents gave her, Sirius Black giving up his position as secret-keeper to Peter Pettigrew, Hermione leaving Muggle Studies class, Lavender Brown losing her baby bunny, Binkyto a fox, Hermione's turn with a boggart, Lupin drinking the wolfsbane potion, Sirius Black breaking into the dormitory, Snape's version of Sirius, Lupin, James, and Peter and how he was almost killed by the whomping willow when it was set by sirius during the transformation, but James saved him, the marauders were unregistered animagus, and othere parts of the book that did not make it into the movie.  <br />19. Honeydukes looks like a place where people smoke, sell, and buy drugs. Harry was not supposed to take the blood-flavored lollipop from Neville. The Shrieking Shack and other scenes were too rushed in this film. Harry's crying made me want to throw up. Harry was supposed to throw mud at Draco and his gang, but instead he threw snowballs at them.  <br />20. Lupin looked like a hairless mexican dog when he transformed into a werewolf.  <br />21. The sets (the whomping willow, too much time was spent when the birds kept hitting into the tree), scenery (Hagrid's hut was moved into a steep hill instead of the by the castle like it was supposed to.), locations, actors, and camera techniques changed.  <br />22. The acting went from bad to worse, The dialogue went from terrible to horrible. There were too many instances with shrunken heads, mirror (reflections), time (growing up), giant pumpkins (Pumpkins cannot grow in Hagrid's Hut in June, it would have rotted there), and hideous dark crows. This movie tried to be funny, dark, creative, and different from the other Harry Potter films which ended up to be the worst Harry Potter film so far. This movie was too short, not literal, not accurate, and the director did not even read the Harry Potter books.  <br />23. Hermione was not supposed to grab Ron's wrists, it is so wrong. There was not supposed to be anything between the 2. I felt as the director had decided to add fanfiction ideas and string up rumors that are not true. There are only 5 deleted scenes. Everything in the 1st 2 films were much longer.  <br />24.Alfonso Cuaron should not be able to the direct any more Harry Potter films, Mike Newell is already wrecking Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire from what I have seen and heard of so far. I am hoping the director for Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix will do much better because so far, Harry Potter has been inking lower with each movie, I am afraid that the next Harry Potter film might bomb. My hope is quickly fading as I hear more about the next Harry Potter movie.I heard that this Harry Potter movie foreshadows events in the last 2 Harry Potter books, if that is true, then the 6th and 7th Harry Potter books will be ruined, Only time can only tell when I know what happens. <br /> <br />P.S. Snape looks like he's constipated.
0920668372|5.0|I was given this book when my first child was born in '91. I fell in love with it! I cried everytime I read it. The person who gave it to me explained that someone had given it to her the first time she became a mother and she loved it so much that she made it a tradition to give as a gift to every first time mother she knew. Now I do that too. What a lovely perspective on a mothers love...what a great way to say it!
B0001611DI|5.0|This is my all time favorite Zombie movie. Just killing zombies in a mall! That is everyone's dream right???
B000002H97|5.0|This cd rocks dude! I think this is one of the best Metallica cds. And they picked the perfect singles for it too. If you don't have this cd, you are not a true Metallica Fan, Im sorry. This cd has awesome guitar riffs and solos! You won't understand its greatness untill you buy it, SO BUY IT NOW!!!!!!!!!
B0006399FS|3.0|I am a big U2 fan so I usually love everything that they do.  However, this album never quite made it for me.  It's not a terrible piece of work, they just could have done better.  There are some really good songs on this CD but most of it just seems like fluff.  I know that they can't always be perfect and deep, but I expected better than this.
B00065VTU4|4.0|Well, I'm sorry, but it hasn't. \\"461\\" was always a great record, and the accompanying live disc is quite good without being truly spectacular.   But the five studio outtakes don't do anything at all for the album...for one thing, they have been available for a long time already. And none of them are particularly interesting; they are outtakes, songs that didn't make the cut, and they sound like outtakes. Even Clapton's rendition of Jimmy Reed's \\"Ain't That Lovin' You Baby\\" is tepid and meandering.    The live album is compiled from two concerts Eric Clapton gave at the Hammersmith Odeon in London on December 4th and 5th, 1974. Again, he often sounds a little bit too laid back, like on a sleepy \\"The Sky Is Crying\\" which completely lacks the intensity of the original.  But there are some fine moments as well, like \\"Let It Rain\\", \\"Layla\\", and the always good \\"Let It Grow\\". Nothing to make you throw away your copy of \\"Eric Clapton's Rainbow Concert\\", however, and this reissue is mostly for diehards, to be honest.    3 3/4 stars. Some good live songs, but the added studio recordings are so-so. The original LP was better, actually...all this second-rate material only serves to obscure the high overall quality of the material originally issued.
0670033375|5.0|By reading this book we will understand the collapses of some societies in our time, such as Iraq, Afganistan because of some narrow minded leaders.   <br />Some other countries such as Iran, and neighboring coutries can learn a great deal from this.  Isn't it true that most of these countries are collapsing because of their narrow minded leaders? Check the Iranian society for example...
B00000255O|5.0|Considering that this album is the follow up to Herbie Hancock's brilliant 'Headhunters' and 'Thrust',the albums that wrote the book on the funk-jazz sound 'Man-Child' is bound to be as magical an album as the mysterious cover art suggests and it is.\\"Hang Up Your Hang Ups\\" is a strident,funky blacksploitation thats chocked FULL of guitar and Moog breaks for you hip-hop samplers!Elsewhere \\"Sun Touch\\" and \\"Bubbles\\" are smoldering,drippy funky fusion filled with lush,melodic keyboard and analog synth textures.\\"The Traiter\\",\\"Heartbeat\\" and \\"Steppin In It\\" are harder edged uptempo funk.Overall 'Man-Child' comes off as the 'pure funk album' Herbie was planning to make with his previous two records because the jazz influences are kept to a bare minimum.For fans of fusion and mid 70's electronic Moog/ARP funk this album is a treasure but for those interested in earlier,more abstract fusion this may not be your thing.It's only a pitty that some very similar sounding and conceived albums by George Duke and Jan Hammer from roughly this same period remain out of print.It's a testament to the fact that,luckily,Hancock managed to be connected with Columbia records who have kept classic funk LP's by Herbie Hancock like this in print!
B00008977N|4.0|Absolutely stunning concert performance here.  I bought the VHS when it came out, and literally wore the tape out.  Visually, the DVD *is* better - crisper, cleaner, just better.  But the audio mix on the VHS tape is far superior to any of the DVD mixes.  Tony Levin carries this band, and for some reason the mixes on the DVD do not reflect this fact.  It is vaguely reminiscent of the Eagles \\"Hell Freezes Over\\" DVD, where the songs are great, the video editing well done, and the audio is just wrong.  If you're a casual listener, you will never know, and you will think that it sounds great.  The more you know about audio, the more you are disappointed by how good this thing could have been, and wasn't.
B0001CCXGG|5.0|I agree with the reviewer from NY. Do NOT be put off by the initial comments from the Toronto \\"guitar fan\\"....there is absolutely nothing shred-like on this CD or the DVD from Yngwie. What you do get is jaw-dropping blazing solos from a guitar player that simply surpasses anyone in the genre from a technical standpoint. It is perfectly obvious that he completely overshadows Vai and Satriani in terms of pure energy and technical prowess. I did NOT notice any negative body language from Vai and Satriani, in fact it appeared that they were dumbfounded at the antics of Yngwie. <br /> <br />The comment regarding \\"ego-masturbating\\" is a moot point when considering the fact that G3 is all about self indulgence. G3 wouldn't be such a success if it wasn't marketed in this way. <br /> <br />Yngwie is simply a huge cut above all the rest, his more recent music, instrumentals in particular, are not easy to listen to and it's therefore not geared to the masses and the punters....this isn't Bon Jovi !!!  <br /> <br />I thoroughly enjoyed the performances by Vai and Satriani, but compared to Yngwie's set, they are absolutely lacking in raw energy. As my 16 year old son commented after watching the DVD a few times : \\"Vai and Satriani, although they try, simply don't have the same guitar maturity of Yngwie....\\".  <br /> <br />Why is it that a true genius is always labelled as egocentric ? Don't be put off by the initial review here....this is an ACE CD/DVD and it's a brilliant idea to introduce a guitarist of a completely different style and of course caliber to the G3 trio. <br /> <br />And before I forget, the \\"Dream Theater live at the Budokan\\" is THE most stunning live DVD on the market at this time. Petrucci is about as far from shredding as we all are are from seeing world peace.....GET THIS DVD.
0380977788|4.0|\\"Coraline\\" caught my eye when I saw it in the bookstore with its disturbing cover and intriguing book description.  It is a quick-paced 'fairy-tale' gone sour about an adventurous girl who yearns to be loved.<br /><br />Young Coraline and her parents have just moved into a new flat in a large, old house.  When her parents pay little attention to her, she is drawn to the locked door in the off-limits drawing room.  Behind the door is a brick wall.  But one day while her mother is out, Coraline unlocks the door to find a hallway, and a flat just like hers.  It even has her other mother and her other father, except, they're not quite the same as her parents.  Everything is better on the other side, but when Coraline's other mother wants her to stay, she gets frightened and returns home.  However, she discovers that her parents are missing, and she must return to this other flat in order to rescue them.<br /><br />Neil Gaiman has crafted a marvelous children's story that is disturbing as it is good.  Coraline's other mother is a twisted, evil creature, who will stop at nothing to keep Coraline with her.  Along the way Coraline encounters various characters both real, and twisted recreations in the 'other' world.  The illustrations by Dave McKean are excellent depictions of this nightmare that Coraline cannot escape.  As much as I enjoyed the story, I found the ending to be a bit summary.  While Coraline is brave and resourceful in conquering her other mother, I thought it was a bit too nicely buttoned up at the end (pun intended for those who have read the book).  All in all, a quick, enjoyable, spooky read for anyone with as vivid an imagination as Neil Gaiman.
B000268QB2|4.0|I borrowed this disc from a friend who recommended it and I was pleasantly surprised.  The guy has a similar sound to Freddy Mercury and a little Ultravox (minus all the synth).  It's really quite catchy.  The songs are more serious and slower but I still like it and enjoy it more each time I listen. I had to buy my own copy.  Enjoy this fresh new sound from the UK!
B00000IPAX|4.0|Blink 182's Enema of the State is a classic, just like \\"What's My Age Again?\\"  This CD rox!!  Blink's the shizich.
B000002TQV|5.0|What else can i say?  There is no other album out there that is like this one.  Yes, this album is quite depressing, but it does have it's niche.  Buy it.  Now.
B00005MP58|5.0|I FIRST SAW THIS MINISERIES WHEN IT WAS FIRST SHOWN IN ENGLAND AND CAPTIVATED THE ATTENTION OF THE WHOLE COUNTRY.  SINCE THEN IT HAS REMAINED MY FAVORITE MINI-SERIES EVER AS WELL AS MY FAVORITE BOOK.  I LOVE THE CHEMISTRY BETWEEN MR. DARCY AND ELIZABETH BENNET.  EVERYTHING IS PERFECT ABOUT THIS MINI-SERIES!  I OWN BOTH THE VHS AND DVD VERSION AND AM HAPPY WITH BOTH.  IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THIS AND ARE A FAN OF JANE AUSTEN, THIS IS A MUST-SEE!
B00005JKN9|5.0|Five stars - but for reasons you may not care about. As I watched this, I realized that the star was not any of the charactors, so much as it was Tamminy Hall.  <br /> <br />And I thouught how well the affable and cheerfully corrupt Boss Tweed would have fit right in with the politics of today; at home in the Republican Long Island machine or perhaps enjoying the warmpth of florida. <br /> <br />As entertainment - well, purely speaking, it's not all that escapist. It's more \\"rub your nose into it.\\" But to the extent that I can be sure, it is a faithful account of the truth, and I'm willing to give more credit to DiCaprio than others seem willing to do, and to Cameron Diaz as well.  <br /> <br />I think she handled a tiny, but critical role damned well, and if she was \\"invisible\\", I'd have to say that is true both to the dialogue and the charactor. A fiercly individual woman who nonetheless survived by wits and a talent for invisiblity.  <br /> <br />I also think that DiCaprio managed well with a damed difficult role; it's easy to be noticed with a scenery-chewing bit of villany; Bill the Butcher is probably one of the tastiest roles to come down the pike since Iago. <br /> <br />But \\"Amsterdam\\" is more comparable to Hamlet. And if DiCaprio did not do so well as one would expect of one more \\"worthy,\\" neither did he miss the critical note - that while Butcher Bill was his father's killer, he was also one of the few to truly respect him - and do his best to be a father to yong Amsterdam. <br /> <br />The final death-match between the two would have been easy to hambone; in playing it as straight as possible it almost passes without drama. But, then, I don't think anyone involved was out to show you a good time. This is an actor's vehicle with a trenchent point, so the emotional subtitles are left out.
B0002IVN9W|4.0|I picked up this album a couple of months ago & it has become one of my favorites of 2004.  The songs have great lyrics, some awesome riffs, & often build to a great wave of sound that washes over you.  You can read other reviews for a track by track analysis of the album, but for me the overall feeling produced is more important.   <br /> <br />As the title infers, many of the tracks are influenced by death's in the band's collective families.  The mood of the album is at times melancoly & somewhat sad one, but not in a depressing way.  The feeling is more of a musical celebration of lives lived, moments shared and remebered, and the understanding we all get when we look back at the life of a loved one (and consequently, our own life) and realize what a positve force that person has been in our lives.  That's what I like best about this album, sure the subject of death is there, but the focus  but the result is... life, both musicaly and then of course spiritually. <br /> <br />Pretty cool stuff, & another reminder of what good music can do.
B00000K31V|1.0|Jennifer Jason Leigh and Jude Law have more talent than many actors, who conviced them to do this junk? From the first moment to the last one I couldn't understand the story, full of creatures, strange people, jumps in time and in places and creepy dialogues. What is an actor like Willem Dafoe doing in this movie? It seems the screenplayer wrote the story in one weekend or they didn't paid him. Save your oney for better movies.
B0002DRDBE|5.0|I count myself among Smith's legion of fans -- saw him speak for three hours on the eve of the release of \\"Dogma\\" (no prepared speech, he just answered questions) and he kept a packed auditorium sitting and laughing, it was a fantastic evening. But I've always felt that this was his best movie.  It's self-contained but ambitious; it's witty and smart, despite its no-budget limitations; it says a lot and its characters feel real, despite their satiric edge and the occasional acting slip.  A real gem that speaks to my generation and the ones that followed. <br /> <br />This new edition comes with \\"Snowball Effect,\\" which is an excellent look at the making of \\"Clerks.\\"  It tells the story of the production, warts and all, with great photographs and amusing, interesting current interviews.  I wish I'd seen this when I was 20, it's so inspiring it might've prodded me to get off my butt and make a movie too.  I would be surprised if it didn't have the same effect on a current young viewer, either.
B0000A98ZP|1.0|This movie is terrible!  I'm clueless why it's so popular.  I've never seen so much concentrated whining a movie.  Please don't waste your time by seeing this one.
B00007K02F|2.0|This version of Jane Eyre bored me.  The acting was okay but i didn't feel any chemistry or love between Jane and Mr. Rochester.  It seemed more like they were just saying the lines, but there was no emotion or feelings with them.  Jane's face didn't show much emotion either, and this annoyed me after a while.  The scenes at the school and beautiful scenery and costumes are good, but if you are going to watch a version of Jane Eyre currently available on dvd please watch the A & E version with Samantha Morton as Jane Eyre instead. That movie is 10 times better.  I look forward to watching the Timothy Dalton version when it comes out in dvd too.

0345440900|5.0|My circle of sister-in-laws and I have used Tammy Hogg's suggestions on all of our (total of 10) children.  My three SIL breastfed all of their children until they stopped lactating or the child was one year old.  They have healthy wonderful children (and so do I but chose not to breastfeed).  I am confused about the reviews that say this book is not for breastfeeding mothers.  The E.A.S.Y. plan worked for all of us, even more so when we were having the 2nd and 3rd child.  There's nothing like being able to take care of yourself (i.e. get a daily shower!) so you can better take care of your children.  Of these 10 children, they all have ranges of personalities and you adjust your attitude as like.  These children are happy and fun.  Their ages at the time of this review are 4 years to 8 mos.  I give this book at every baby shower I attend with a forward similar to what I have written here.  My biggest \\"pro\\" with this book is the philosphy that you should \\"start in the way you want to go\\".  The outcome to executing this statement is so rewarding that I could take so many more paragraphs to tell you.  Consistency in parenting, which at some moments are challenging (after a long day of work with hungry children) will develop the biggest rewards for your family as a whole.  Best wishes to all and a thanks to Tammy Hogg and her publishers for this book.
0198534469|5.0|It is possible to memorize definitions, master proofs and work endless exercises and still feel that you don't understand what's going on.  This is especially true in complex analysis.  This book emphasizes the visual/geometric aspect of analytic functions at the expense of some loss of rigor.  These insights are priceless.   <br /> <br />Needham employs a wider range of mathematical tools than other books aimed at the upper level undergraduate, e.g., Palka and Brown/Churchill.  This would include simple group theory, linear algebra, vector calculus and obviously geometry.  Often this works very well at the expense of some digression. At other times, the more traditional algebraic approach is better.   <br /> <br />This book is unique and fills an important need.
0156027321|4.0|At first I wasn't sure whether I liked the book or not, to tell you the truth it took me a while to get past the first couple pages. But as I made my way through the second chapter there was something about Yann Martel's writing that kept me reading. Even at a part that didn't do much for me he had a way of holding my interest.  <br />      Pi comes off as a young boy very unsure about his life. Therefore, he turns to his faith. Pi can't decide on one faith, therefore he chooses several. His parents can't understand his perception on how several different faiths are all one in the same, I myself couldn't at first either. When the reader is first introduced to Pi he seems like a naive boy very confused about himself, but in no time by turning to faith he seems to evolve into a young man right in front of your eyes, as if all the knowledge he sought was locked up inside of him and somehow, him being the only one able to open it, revealed it to the world.  He seems to find God in everything around him. He seems to find purpose in everything. To him even the simplest life of a small animal whose life is overlooked seems to hold importance. <br />      Pi's family sets out for a new life. They sell all of what they've ever known to start all over in a world they know close to nothing about. Accept they never make it there. Without his family or any means of communication except hand flares, he survives on a raft for over two hundred days. He is not alone though. He is accompanied by Mr. Parker, a 450 lb. Bengal Tiger. Pi has a hard time admitting it, but if it was not for Mr. Parker Pi would have never been able to make it. He was his hope. The tiger was what he was grateful for every morning when he woke up. Right when he was about to give up Mr. Parker is what kept him going. The two encounter very unusual things on their \\"journey\\". Some parts seem so real, and others seem so intangible. For example, they come across a man in the middle of the ocean, in the same exactpredicament as Pi. Both blind, both starving, one man being a murderer and the other stranded with a tiger. <br />      I enjoyed the book up until the ending. Yann Martel gives the reader a false hope throughout the novel making you believe that in the end everything will be okay again. That when Pi reaches land he will be reunited with his family and Mr. Parker will become the family pet. Pi builds up an \\"invisible\\" relationship with Mr. Parker. A relationship you know is there but you can't see. You know that somewhere before the end of the book the two will reach land and be saved. All throughout the book I didn't want them to reach land. I knew they were going to but I was so unsure of what would happen once they get there. I was hoping that Pi and the tiger would never part. They had been through so much together, but in the back of my mind was the rational side of me saying, for goodness sake it's a tiger not a person. Sometimes during my reading I forgot that he was an animal. Pi made him out to be so much more than what he was. All in all I did enjoy the book and as much as I want to I can't say that the end was a let down. Yann Martel had a way of building up hope through Pi, but you knew in the end that they would never be able to be together. It's not how life goes. Life is full of let downs, it's the experience that matters. I had to come to terms with the ending and realize that it's the lesson learned rather than the disappointing ending which I was hoping would never come. <br /> <br />
B00028HBKM|5.0|This movie is life changing, in the very best of senses. If you are looking for a purpose and meaning in life, I suggest you watch this movie. It will show you the love that your God has for you and what He has gone through to secure your ability to have fullness in life through Him. John 3:16 HE loves you and this is a portrayel of the extent of His love. Even though this movie is gory, the beatings were actually much worse in real life for Jesus, (the bible says the He was marred beyong recognition and that He was marred more then any man ever has or or will be) I suggest that all watch this. If you are below 13 I suggest you talk to your parents or a pastor about watching this before you see it. While being a movie all should see, young children may find it hard to watch. God bless you all!
068987474X|3.0|First of all, I did not like this book at all.  It based on one mans opinions and I would rather read a book on the same topic with real psych facts rather than opinions.   <br /> <br />It is also marketed at the Sex and the City watchers when the books seems to be more suited for a younger audience.  If I was still 16 I may have liked this book.   <br /> <br />The book itself costs, depending upon where you purchase it, between 15 - 20 dollars.  When I buy a book in that price range I expect to be reading it for a few days.  It took me no more than an hour to read the entire book!  I think this book is a complete waste of time.
B0002Z0EYK|4.0|Most likely the largest ammount of soliders in a war I ever seen in a movie.It wasn't to bloody but a nice clean movie.Yes they show blood and spears through heads and whatever not , but I woyuldn't own it just for the simple fact it's 162 minutes long and I won't ever watch it again.Brad Pitt played his part very well as the best warrior of the world.He was badd-azz.Rent this movie only.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|Yes, although I know eMOTIVe has been released, this was their last fully original composition of tracks. <br /> <br />A lot happened between the release of APC's first two albums. And The loss and addition of two members (although ex-Smahing Pumpkins guitarist James Iha does not actually play on this release) has certainly added to and subtlely changed the dynamic of this band. Suddenly drums and - especially - bass lines are more dominant in the mix, especially on such songs as The Package, Vanishing, Crimes and Gravity. This gives a darker, more atmospheric edge to this album that was not on their first. <br /> <br />The lyrics are generally intricate and well-thought-out, breaking through the rhythms with clean, melodic vocals. A couple of examples: 'Mistook their nods for an approval, just ignore the smoke and smile' from 'Blue' and 'Dizzy and clearly unable to let this go, High and surrendering to gravity and the unknown, Catch me, heal me, lift me back up to the sun' from 'Gravity'. Maynard is at his peak as a lyricist here. <br /> <br />It's not all dark, gothic ambience here though. There are a few 'louder' tracks intermingled throughout the disc. Notably, Weak & Powerless, Pet and the Outsider. The interesting thing is all these tracks also have their quieter moments. Dispersed throughout 'Pet', and in the introductions to 'Weak & Powerless' and 'The Outsider'. The heaviest track on here would have to be the latter, in which Keenen's voice crests towards the end, drawing on some good old-fashioned Tool-esque aggression. <br /> <br />Billy Howerdel puts in a solid performance on guitar, and perhaps some of his virtue can be attributed to knowing when to step back and let other members of the band take the floor.  on repeated listen, it is amazing how much of his work has been placed into the background of the collective. Whether he is playing right up the front of the mix, or producing captivating atmospherics that require further listening, he is truely anasset to the unique sound that is A Perfect Circle.  <br /> <br />The one track that really took me by surprise was 'the Nurse', a covered track originally done by Failure. Interesting sonics make this a beautiful listen, but not one you're likely to 'get' on the first listen. But this, my friends, is just the kind of album Thirteenth Step is.  <br /> <br />Overall, top marks for Maynard, Billy, Jeordie and Josh. <br />Because that's what it is - a group effort. Definately no weak links here - every musician is a talented and skilled performer in their own right. Eagerly anticipating a follow-up.
B0001A79JO|3.0|This is what The Stray Cats would sound like on ska and estrogen...And with half the talent.
B00005JLEU|5.0|I hardly need to enlarge on the praise already heaped on this film. It's almost impossible to exaggerate its visual quality, storytelling, characterization, and sheer mythopoeic sparkle.  But thank goodness the DVD has the original Japanese track and English subtitles done by translators other than those who worked on the dub.  The dub is simply awful.    To begin with, the voice of one of the two younger principals is horribly miscast. For some reason, Disney thought it would be a good idea to cast an adult to voice a 12-year-old boy.  (He's actually ageless, but this is his usual form.) The voice does not match the character. If this was a compromise to get quality acting then they failed: quality acting is not what they got. Jason Mardsen as Haku is uniformly wooden.    Daveigh Chase ought to have been an appropriate choice for Chihiro, and under other circumstances she might have done a creditable job. Her voice is certainly pleasant enough. But she whines her way through the entire movie even as the character is supposed to be growing past her whineyness.  With such a young actress the fault ought to be laid at the feet of whoever directed the English dub, since she simply can't be expected to have the life experience necessary to achieve an in-depth reading of a complex character on her own.    So if the poor translation didn't serve to change the mood or sense of a scene, the actors often did, but no doubt they were often directed to do so.  The American director seemed more than willing to sacrifice portions of Miyazaki's vision to put his own imprint on the film. When you see the \\"making of\\" feature and understand the great care Miyazaki took to get just the right performance out of his actors, it's hard to see this as anything but vandalism of the crassest kind. If the director didn't do this deliberately, it's an incompetence this film did not merit.    The dub is plagued with needless chatter.  It takes advantage of moments where the characters' mouths aren't visible to insert dialogue that adds nothing to the scene but rather destroys the mood it was setting.  It was annoying enough when Disney did this to Miyazaki's earlier \\"Kiki's Delivery Service\\"; here it's positively jarring even though there's less of it. The added final line of the movie comes close to ruining it, if that was possible, as it reaches for an entirely inappropriate cheap laugh.    Which brings me to the dub's translation.  I know that compromises occasionally have to be made to get the lip movements more or less in synch, but that's no excuse here.  Some of the English dialogue is so at variance with the original that a character's intent seems to be completely inverted at times, and entire scenes take on different meanings.    However, not all the acting is bad and not all the translation is so discreditable.  David Ogden Stiers and Suzanne Pleshette turn in superb performances as the boiler man Kamaji and the twin witches respectively, even if inappropriate words were occasionally given to them to say.  I also know that some have objected to the translation of \\"hanko\\" as \\"seal\\" -- this is the mcguffin driving the second half of the film -- but I'd be hard-pressed to think of something more appropriate. (However, simply calling it \\"magical\\" is inadequate to explain its importance. Some cultural background is helpful here.)    The subtitle translation is far superior, although even someone like myself who knows no Japanese beyond a handful of words can spot some changes. For example, at one point the subtitles have Haku addressing Kamaji by name when he can clearly be heard to be saying \\"ojisan\\", \\"grandfather\\".  This speaks volumes about their relationship, but it was just thrown away for some reason. (The same happens with Chihiro, but with her it matters less because she and Kamaji have enough screen time together that their relationship is understood.) However, being able to hear the fine work of the original actors more than makes up for any small deficiency along these lines.    Why on earth does Disney think it necessary to insert a tedious \\"introduction\\" by John Lasseter at the beginning of every Miyazaki film it distributes?  Yes, the \\"Skip\\" button works here, but why should we have to do this every time we play every disc? It's an annoyance that doesn't have to be there.    This movie cannot be truly appreciated in the Disney version, which might go some way toward explaining its poor performance in the American theatrical relsease. It deserves to be seen as Miyazaki made it.  Please treat yourself to a viewing of it.
B0006399FS|4.0|I am a big fan of U2 and recently bought this album expecting something fairly upbeat.  This album is very enjoyable and easy on the ears but I must say at times I just tuned out because it seemed a bit boring.  I am glad I bought it but with the title of the album I would have expected something a bit more energetic!
B0000AMRJC|3.0|I'm not impressed with this movie like most of the U.S.I mean everybody has a hard on for this movie , why because of the mountain of cocaine the man sniffs or all the money he makes.It's a MOVIE.One big huge fantasy ! Atleast movies like Goodfellas and Casino really happened in real life and aren't carried away.Never send a whiteman to play a cuban drug lord.It's not convincing.I liked King of New York better , but it that movie was drier and those big bins of dope wasn't convincing in K.O. NY
B0001LJCMK|2.0|Well I'm not sure where to start so I'm going to cut to the chase.  The singer can't sing. The drummer is ok.  Guitar riffs are so-so.  The lyrics aren't very good either.  There false stop is overused. Happens in every song from what I remember.  I only listened to this once or twice.  I Only Want You is the only good song on this cd.  I felt that on most of this album the band was going for catchy driving riffs but since they aren't very good, I heard gargled guitars with the same drum beat.  Avoid this please.  If you want catchy rythms with great lyrics, try Hot Water Music.
B000002KIE|5.0|After being told that Avril Lavigne, Simple Plan, and Limp Bizkit are punk, it's nice to listen to something that actually is.  The Sex Pistols revolutionized punk rock and music in general.  Never Mind the Bollocks is a great CD with good lyrics and catchy, meaningful songs.  Get this CD, it's a classic and the enjoyability has not diminished since it was first released in the 70's.
B0002OERI0|5.0|As a recovering Punk Rocker, I know what the idealogy behind Punk Rock has always been, be yourself. Sadly, most people don't have a clue as to whom they are. This album covers all of those bases, from the title track where Jimmy decides what he doesn't want to be. All the way to Whatshername, where reliving the past becomes a pasttime, even if he doesn't want to remember the person he shared this past with. In between, we have chest pounding I know I am but not really attitude in all five parts of Jesus of Suburbia, to soul searching and confusion in Boulevard of Broken Dreams and Are We the Waiting. Then finding love, and losing love, in She's A Rebel and Letterbomb respectively. This is the album Green Day fans, and the rest of the world, have been waiting for. It's got something for everyone... and everything for the most true of Punk Rockers, the ones who know that the whole ideal of Punk Rock, is to be themselves, even if they're not sure who they are.

B00005JMYI|1.0|This was Will Ferrell's least funniest movie yet to hit the big screen.There was like 2 funny parts and that's it.Christina Applegate is getting much to old , her nose job really looks bad.I hope Will Ferrell stops making stupid non-funny films.I liked ELF more than this movie.What happened to Ferrell in this movie.Either way the man got payed \\"jerk\\".
B0006A9FKA|5.0|<br />Here's an interesting turn on the zombie-invasion genre: what if people go on with their lives, and don't even know what's going on?  How many days would it take for you to realize?  There's a touch of that in the original \\"Night of the Living Dead\\" (so these two in the graveyard don't listen to the radio?  How many days have the attcks been happening?).  Brilliantly, the filmmakers here realized that the concept of impending doom is just as scary as zombies eating flesh.  Glimpses of zombies casually viewed off in the distance is scary stuff. <br /> <br />Besides being a pitch-perfect horror film (there is some serious gore, be warned), it's also very, very funny.  Never does it go lame on us, it's Fawtly Towers, Ab Fab, Monty Python-level funny.  Leave it to the British to concoct such a dry approach to total armageddon.  Whats more, the movie has a big heart, and an endearing troop of characters we pray won't end up as food.   <br /> <br />I'm bummed that I did't get to see this with an audience.  I would love to have experinced the mix of terror and elation. <br /> <br />After the movie, dig through the DVD supplements for answers (told via storyboard and commentary) to what happened to some of the missing characters.  It's quite wonderful. <br />
B0006213WG|5.0|Wondeful CD.  I've liked Sum 41 since Fat Lip, and quite frankly they've only gotten better.  No Reason quite literally makes me jump up and play air guitar while listening to it.  Buy this CD.
B000089RV6|4.0|Okay, I am fourteen and am not into the current metal, rock, blah blah blah. I am a big fan of the old school rock like black sabbath, van halen, and led zeppelin. Of course i recently baught the cd back in black and i was blown away.angus and malcolm are brilliant in this cd. for brian johnsons first album he wasnt bad, but he was trying to hard to be like the greates acdc singer bon scott. The singing in you shook me all night long is a little sloppy but other wise the whole album was great. I can't tell you any acdc album better than this other than highway to hell. If bon scott would have died a little later and recorded this than it would be the top 5 best rock n roll cd's ever known to mankind.
B0002ZYE1Y|4.0|Hey lovers, <br /> <br />I'm a fairly new fan of Nightwish, but I think it's safe to say that I'm fairly obsessesed with them, in that I've had nothing but a few of their albums in my CD player's for the past few weeks.  <br /> <br />\\"Once\\" is their latest and, like their others, an awesomely good listen. It is, without question, more symphonic. Symphonic to the point, in fact, that the album probably can't even be declared \\"metal\\", or at least not as metal as \\"Wishmaster\\" or \\"Oceanborn\\". The supplied orchestra really makes up for a lot of regular metal instrumentation, and while I found this a bit \\"eh\\" at first, I've grown to love it. It's all very \\"Boston Pops\\" sounding, if that means anything; the writing for orchestra isn't 'brilliant', but it's superficially intoxicating, sort of a good description for the band, actually. Several tracks throw in orchestral bits to great effect; soaring woodwinds, roaring choruses -- that type of stuff. I'd probably say the two most impressive tracks in regards to that are \\"Dark Chest of Wonders\\" and, the best track on the disc, the pompous and utterly joyous \\"Ghost Score Love\\", which is as overblown as possible, but still a rollercoaster of a ride. The whole track is mindblowingly exciting. <br /> <br />It's difficult to say if this is Nightwish's best album, as many here have claimed. I'd say there's a good chance it is, if only because the tracks seem more mature, the orchestrations more elaborate, and the harmonies between metal instrumentation and symphony well thought out and performed. Each track in itself is good, though to be honest a few in the middle are good and nothing more, and the end result is an album that simply remains exciting over many repeated listens (I'd know, I must be on 20 or so).
0425180638|3.0|This book is well paced and Cornwell brings back the suspense.  I am an avid reader of Cornwell, or I guess I should say was.  I only recently started reading her again.  I was just bored with Cornwell's Scarpetta series after Black Notice, I mean a Werewolf!!!!, but this book is better, actually quite good.  Of her last three novels this is the strongest and Trace the weakest, which is most regrettable sence it is her most recent.  I do get tired of the seven degrees of Scarpetta, I mean is everyone she ever meets interconnected somehow, some of it is believeable, but much is just plain ridiculous.  Having said that I still consider the Scarpetta series to be one of the best and encourage anyone who loves thrillers to read it from start to finish or at least to Point of Origin.  If you are bored with Cornwell, try David Lindsey, now he IS the best.
B00003CX8Y|5.0|As everyone says, this is a good movie. Why is it so good? It is because our heroine, Belle, is good. Not selfish, not lying, simply good. Each of her actions show selflessness and bravery: when she goes out to rescue her father, and when she takes his place in the castle. And a particular moment that I adore: Belle has run away from the Beast because he has scared her; he rescues her and fights off the wolves, then collapses in the snow. And Belle, seeing what he has done for her, does what is right: she loads him onto her horse and takes him back to the castle, even though her intention was to leave.<br /><br />The Beast, too, is good in many of his actions as well. He goes after Belle and rescues her, risking his life. He lets her go to save her father, when he is at the point of breaking the spell.<br /><br />And then there are the shared moments, as the two of them fall slowly in love: the yelling through her bedroom door; her tending him in front of the fireplace after he saved her life; the snowball fight, when Belle begins to realize her feelings and woners what she is doing because he is, after all, a Beast; learning to eat together; dancing; and then, at the end, when he is so grateful that she came back. And then when she thinks she has lost him and puts her hands over her mouth in alarm...<br /><br />Besides the sterling character of the characters, there are other reasons this movie was nominated for Best Picture. The opening scene at the village is like being brought into an opera, with Belle, the villagers, and Gaston all singing beautifully as they describe what they want out of life. And what book lover does not sympathize with Belle, as she effuses over a story to be greeted with polite indifference?<br /><br />Good movie. Simply good.
0156029065|4.0|It was an entertaining read.  Sit back and enjoy the ride.  Interesting insights into the Byzantine way of life as well as original interpretation of the various events that occured during that time. We find a Baudolino in every century, unfortunately we never get to hear his story when we read our history books.

B00003CXCT|4.0|The \\"original\\" Star Wars trilogy is finally available on DVD and I purchased it over the holidays (the reason for the quotes will soon be apparent). I wasn't expecting much with regards to the quality since the movies were all filmed over 20 years ago, despite the requisite digital remastering. Much to my surprise, the movies actually look spectacular. The quality is without question better than you would get in an actual movie theater. I'm really thrilled with that.    My enthusiasm turned to revulsion as I neared the end of Return of the Jedi, however. I hadn't heard anything about additional changes to the movies, other than the ones added back when the trilogy came out on VHS (when the Jabba the Hut scene was added to ANH), so I was completely shocked and appalled when Hayden Christensen made an appearance as Anakin Skywalker. After Luke removes Vader's mask and has a conversation with Sebastian Shaw, the actor playing Anakin, the latter dies and is cremated with honor in a funeral pyre on the moon of Endor. In the final scene of the trilogy, Luke is pleased as he sees the ghosts, essentially, of Ben Kenobi and Yoda, joined by his father, played by Sebastian Shaw in the original movie. In the DVD vesion, it is not the original actor, but Hayden Christensen who strolls up to join Ben and Yoda.    This is going to sound like sour grapes, but I'm absolutely furious. I know George Lucus considers these movies his own to do with as he chooses and technically he is correct. But Star Wars, especially the original, is more than just one man's project now. The movies have become so ingrained into the minds and hearts of their fans that they are in a real sense, a national treasure. In that they should be sacrosanct and immutable. Imagine taking the Declaration of Independance out of its view box and scribbling \\"even if you're black\\" next to the phrase \\"We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men are created equal,\\" just because 80 years later the people decidedthat that phrase should have been in there to start with. It's ludicrious. It's revisionist history. And what Lucus has done is even worse because what he did was not because of some widespread recognition that a wrong needed to be righted. Nay, there is no other explanation than that he did it to arrogantly prove that Star Wars belongs to him alone and not the masses.    To top it off, in Lucus's zeal to tie in the prequels, which are viewed by all but him as inferior to the originals, to Episodes IV-VI, he has marred the original movies, doing what a true fan such as myself would have thought impossible, turning the original trilogy itself into an inferior product. First of all, Luke never had the opportunity to see his father as a young man, even in pictures. Hayden Christensen doesn't look anything like Sebastian Shaw. How would Luke even know who he was? The expression on Luke's face is one of recognition; recognition, among other things, that his father will live on forever in the company of his friends on the good side of the force. Instead it should be one of puzzlement: \\"Who is that guy?\\"    And why would Anakin get to live on in eternity as a young man while Ben and Yoda, who never wavered from the proper course of a jedi, were not exempted from the ravages of time. The transposition of Hayden for Sebastian is not only blasphemous in theory, in practice it is forced and awkward.     The addition of the extra celebration scenes, clearly designed to make it known that the defeat of the Empire was celebrated galaxy-wide, not just on the moon of Endor, was unnecessary and the insertion forced changes that were just as scarring to the film. Apparently, it was felt that since the celebration was universal, the score must be universal as well. This led to the removal of the Ewok song that played in the original. The song's countenence would be familiar to all, though it's translation here will necessarily be lacking. Bum ba bum ba bum, bum bum ... Bum ba bum babum, BUM BUM ... BUM BA BUM BA BUM, BUM BUM  ... crescendoing to a dramatic seque into the main theme as the credits start to roll. It provided the perfect bombastic musical ending to a series in the which the score contributed greatly. The new music has no such effect. It is flat and boring, a paltry substitute for the original. The movies go out with a whimper, not a bang.    Still, the DVDs are a must own for any Star Wars fan, especially one with an HDTV as the overall quality of the picture is heretofor unimagininable. George Lucus, however, is off my Christmas list for good.
0688163173|4.0|I immensely enjoyed Mystic River (5 stars de luxe...) and jumped at the occasion to read again a book by the same extremely talented author. But I didn't understand the end of the book (may be my English is to blame - not my mother tongue), that's why I rate it only 4 stars.<br /><br />Is someone out there capable of decoding the end for me ??
0765301598|4.0|I liked this book best of any of the Brian Herbert prequels.  There was a bit less grotesque torture.  But I especially liked that the story went somewhere.  Some of the others tended to drag a bit, or seem like they weren't really progressing, with just smalls parts of something actually happening.  We finally get to find out why the Harkonnens & Artriedes feud, & all the other loose ends are also tied up.  I found it quite enjoyable reading, & perhaps my favorite Dune book after the original Dune.
0517548232|3.0|The value of this book depends on what you expect out of it. I bought this book so I can get a good idea about basic economics in general not about government economic policies. But this book essentially goes about picking one government policy after another (like tax cuts, protection of industries, price fixations, minimum wage etc) and goes about telling us why such artificial measures are not right and why the economy should in general be left to free market forces.     As such, the book was a kind of disappointment for me - in not meeting my requirements. Though I should say that by itself, the contents of the book are quite good and generally enlightening.
B00004U8H4|5.0|Hey! I haven't seen you in here before, but I *have* seen you, right---didn't we meet at Dorsia? Yeah, I know it's tough to get reservations there, but trust me---I can get them anytime. I'm connected with the Maitre D'. Dinner, say Friday, say eight? Where do you work out, anyway?<br /><br />Since we're talking Movers and Shakers, let me introduce you to my homeskillet Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale, who completely owns the film)---he's the go-to guy in Mergers & Acquisitions at Pierce & Pierce, Wall Street investment banking hotshot, hooking up with Upper East Side fashion maven and society diva Evelyn Williams (Reese Witherspoon, compulsively consuming)---the lucky dog!---and frankly, between the two of us, the guy you want to talk to to cuff your links, tie your knots, and give you the low-down on the best shoes to accent your Hugo Boss or Armani. PC before PC was cool. Big on the enviroment, nuclear freeze, health care, education, helping out the poor and downtrodden, stamping out genocide in Sri Lanka. Boy Next Door.<br /><br />Monster and Serial Killer.<br /><br />Yep, Patrick is big on buying industrial nail guns, stapling witless prostitutes to the floor, touching them up with a little acid facial, topping that off with some mace, and storing their heads in his Sub-Zero high-end refrigerator/freezer unit. He wants to fit in, our Patrick, but you know, a man's got to have hobbies. Norman Bates said it perfectly when he noted \\"we all go a little crazy sometimes\\".<br /><br />OK, granted, bad example. But Jesus, a man's got to---you know---*vent* sometimes.<br /><br />When I heard they were making Bret Easton Ellis's study in psychosis and carnal yuppiedom \\"American Pyscho\\" into a movie, I thought it couldn't be done. Then I heard Mary Harron was helming it, and I sighed with bliss: Harron's \\"I Shot Andy Warhol\\" was a kind of cinematic kindred spirit to American Psycho, both delving into the mental states of complete gibbering lunatics no one took seriously.<br /><br />I see you're staring at my shoes---they're Allen-Edmonds wingtips (USD 795). Oh, you're not? Where was I? Is that Donald Trump?<br /><br />Anyway, the flick chronicles our man Bateman---a practical GQ fashion & hygiene expert, I might add!---in his days as Wall Street guru, his nights as impromptu surgeon. He's a great authority on Huey Lewis & the News, which you can hear on his state-of-the-art B&O surround sound system (USD 25,000), accompanied by Bateman's ever-astute commentary---that is, if you can hear it over the screams.<br /><br />He exults in six-pack abs. He keeps his skin nice and taut and rosy with all sorts of unguents and admixtures. He has a great tan, compliments of his little tanning sarcophagus. He hits the club scene and comes home with dinner, dinner that talks and thinks and hopes. He keeps those abs bristling with daily workouts, accompanied to porn tapes and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. He'd better damn sure have a better business card than you.<br /><br />Harron takes liberties with Ellis's material, but captures the essentials like a champ. This isn't a gory flick---not by a longshot, given that the literary Bateman liked introducing a starving wharf rat into the nether regions of his victims---but it gets the point across.<br /><br />Bateman tearing through a high end West Side penthouse with a chainsaw (my God, the boy has good aim!). Bateman administering the coup de grace to a bum, then stomping the bum's cowering doggy to death. Bateman feeding a kitten to the friendly neighborhood ATM (it says FEED ME A KITTEN---honestly, could you resist? Not I!). Bateman despairing at being outdone by his wretched rival Paul Allen (the incomparable Jared Leto, smirking and smarmy to the exceptionally bitter end).<br /><br />From what's for dinner on the menu at New York's high end eateries (might I recommend the Dauphin Gratinois with the Lobster frappe?), to the existential agonies of getting a good table at Dorsia, to the shame of living in even a good Upper West Side apartment (with doorman), Harron nails the raw bloody guts of the No-Exit damnation lurking at the black, fetid, festering, maggot-ridden heart of High Society---or any society, for that matter. Cinematographer Andrzej Sekula gives Harron full air support---and he should, since he did the camera-work for Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction, and Four Rooms. Stuff looks good here.<br /><br />Bale put me off on my first viewing---his campy smile, his goofy voice, his off-kilter mannerisms---but he's perfect. Bateman isn't in control, after all: he thinks his mask is slipping, when it's already on the floor and shunting down the drain.<br /><br />Frankly, all the acting is first-rate: Samantha Mathis Xanax'd to perfection as Bateman's mistress and free-range society delectation Courtney, Matt Ross as the hideous Luis Carruthers, Justin Theroux owning yet another bit part as Bryce, Josh Lucas note-perfect as McDermott, Chloe Sevigny is at her cringing, cloying best---my god, it's hard not to adore her---and Willem Dafoe as the police detective, looming like a stormcloud about to break that never really does, and proving---with his face alone---that Sam Raimi was off his rocker to even *think* about putting Dafoe in a mask as the Green Goblin. Fool.<br /><br />Some call this satire. Ignore them. This is pure, unadulterated horror; Pat Bateman's midnight outtings are consequence and causality of our wearing one too many masks to placate society: the Beast must get out! It must eat!<br /><br />Why are you staring at my tie (Forzieri, USD 275.00)? Nah, that's not blood---it's spaghetti sauce from lunch, silly. Anyway, I gotta hop---time is money, and I've got to return some videotapes.ia, to the shame of living in even a good Upper West Side apartment (with doorman), Harron nails the raw bloody guts of the No-Exit damnation lurking at the black, fetid, festering, maggot-ridden heart of High Society---or any society, for that matter.

B0006399FS|3.0|i hope it will grow on me.  so far i only like sometimes you can't make it on your own.  i really hated vertigo, but i still had high hopes.  u2 is one of my favorite bands and i expect a lot from them.  most of these songs sound like they are ripping themselves off, and they are not even doing a good job at it.
068987474X|1.0|Let us examine some of the authors sentiment. They say and I quote: \\"If a guy truly likes you, but for personal reasons he needs to take things slow, he will let you know that immediately. He won't keep you guessing, because he'll want to make sure you don't get frustrated and go away.\\" First off if someone has a whack of personal reasons for slowing things down. Should he really be dating in the first place. Secondly, that is if he has his emotions in order and is not embarrassed by some of the issues he is facing - this is pretty messed up thinking. Tell me for instance what guy wants to dump his personal reasons on someone he is interested in right away? That is right a needy guy.  <br /> <br />They try to us that we are all \\"super foxes\\" and to stop lowering our standards. Of course everyone likes to hear that they are special. But come on ladies, just think about it for a moment. How do we treat each other? It is not always good. We are not all \\"super foxes\\" especially the ones amongst us that aren't fantastic, some of us are known to conive and to  manipulate. Why do you think the movie \\"Mean Girls\\" was so popular? Because us women could all relate to it. And by the way a \\"super fox\\" would be the hunter not the prey.  <br /> <br />Greg even relates a story about a bartender named Lindsey and how he was so astute to track her down the next day after she told him her name. He even makes it sound like he was incredibly astute finding her number. He says: \\"do you know how many Lindsey A's there are in every major city?\\" I am going to guess not many. And more so, is it wise for us women to be giving out personal information to strangers. Of course it is, because after-all all guys are fantastic. By the way in my city which is pretty major there is not one single Lindsey with the surname mentioned listed in the phone book.  <br /> <br />I am going to stop now. I could go on and on about the messages in this book, however I think I might be actually encouraging sales. The most scary thing about this book is they seem to believe that the way the world is supposed to work is that women should  go thru life waiting for things to happen to them and then they should just react. It seems to discount every other option. If guys are not throwing themselves at your feet they are \\"JUST NOT THAT INTO YOU\\". Once again what world do we live in where our whole purpose of the men on this planet is to find one woman and be into her 100% of the time all of the time. I agree if you find your \\"true love\\" you will be, but even in those circumstances sometimes it takes time, even years for that to evolve. If we are to live the way the authors recommend, being a divorce lawyer will just keep getting more and more lucrative.  <br /> <br />I think the thing that bugs me the most about this book is this. In the beginning I don't think the authors took themselves too seriously. Then the craze began. People started to eat it up. Next the authors started forget this was just meant to be entertainment. That is the main reason I can't recommend this book. When did light entertainment become reality? <br /> <br />One positive for me. This is the first book that I have read that made me actually right a review about it. My advice is spare your dime. Find a different book. <br />
B0000025F7|5.0|What would've happened if this album had been alot more successful? I think there may have been no 'Thriller', or certainly not a shadow of the album that shook the world like no other. Sometimes things are meant to be. This album was great, particularly 'Don't Stop Till You Get Enough' and 'Rock With You', but didn't receive the recognition Michael thought it should've. Enter Thriller. Anyway 5 stars it gets.....
B000069I1H|1.0|This movie was so bad, I fell asleep watching it in the theatre. I normally like Buddy Films, but this one was just plain bad. The jokes were horrible, the acting was worse. Reality TV fits into this movie seamlessly, which is probably another reason why I didn't enjoy it. I think \\"Reality\\" programming is another sign of the steady decline of the entertainment business. To sum it all up, save your money, I'm sure you can find a better way to spend it.
B000000OQF|5.0|my all time favorite, it came out when i was ten i loved it then and still do.  amazing.
B0002XH9Z4|5.0|Even though its slightly overpriced. I think most of the best are here. And the DVD Bucharest concert from 92 is the real selling point of this BOX-SET...
0684867621|5.0|Other reviews have synopsized the story.  My main comment is that what makes this book exceptional, for both kids and adults, is that King in no way trivializes nine year old Trisha's thinking processes.  He is able to project her fears and ideas without sounding condescending or trite.  The book carries one away into Trisha's world.  S**t on Toast... what a scary place!!  I rate this as a must-read.
0345452585|4.0|I've I always been a grand fan of Jonathan Kellerman, and Alex Delaware and Milo Sturgis have remained tried and true over the years. And although Alex and Milo have taken a sabbatical in this richly descriptive book, it was a wonderful read and they were hardly missed.<br /><br />Intrique, personal demons and and suspense are once again brought to the forefront in this exceptional authors latest endeavor.<br /><br />Highly recommended and will be one of the books that I will revisit again in the future.
B00006AG5N|3.0|The two naff alternative versions of A FOOL SUCH AS I...THE WONDER OF YOU.
B00019PDKC|5.0|I own all their albums and know how they've evolved. But the post-eternity-Anathema is something so beautifully carved onto rock music that one cant really escape its grip. My mood varies in marking \\"judgement\\" or \\"alternative 4\\" as their true masterpiece simply because when I hear the intro violins of \\"fragile dreams\\" & the immaculate literature in \\"inner silence\\" off alternative 4 and compare it with the heart ripping \\"one last goodbye\\" & the perfect composition of \\"emotional winter\\" of judgement, I get confused. For me the band has no main-stream and defined genre. It might get compared to katatonia or my dying bride or the sweet sounding opeth or even pink floyd-put-to-metal, but for me its a class in its own. \\"Temporary peace\\" was enough for me to get \\"a fine day to exit\\" and the cd cover of a lonesome boat surviving a disaster is more than enough to get \\"a natural disaster\\" as it speaks on its own about the profundity in their music. <br />A natural disaster has got nothing to do with their roots in terms of music genre. Neither has judgement, nor has alternative 4 and obviously not \\"a fine day to exit\\". It seems as if they've been changing the nature of sadness in all their albums, sort of like a maturity and persistence in melancholy in thoughts that makes them write those kind of lyrics and convert them into small musical master pieces. Now thats art. Malady in music is not about growling gothic stuff or screaming just like a guitar, its about maturity in the expression. My dying bride tend to do it, so does opeth with their exquisite lyrics.....but anathema is something else. While clinging on to its metal roots, it transforms into celestial kind of a sad impression marked with loneliness. This band is not for someone who likes to rock hard, bang head, go wild or growl, its for someone who likes to listen to depression. Every album offers a different kind of depression. A Natural disaster not only adds another beautiful addition to the band's discography,it also takes them to a well established position where the musicians are talented, love to experiment and succeed all the time.
B000002U82|3.0|There was a time when all the talk was about this album. It was as if 'Pink Floyd' were the new 'Beatles', they managed to put synthesizers with rock rhythm and survive. And America fell in love with another British born group. This album is good, but I think the 'Wall' and even 'Wish You Were Here' are BETTER. 'Time' is the real gem on this album...
B000002ADT|5.0|Once more, the two inmortals jazz stars have done it. This is a CD that would really fascinate even those who are not familiar with Coltrane or Davis' mellow jazz tunes. A really romantic and blue performance, definitely a five star!.
B0000026WD|5.0|I think apart from the world beater 'Black Or White', this album had more artistic progression than Michael's previous 3 best sellers. 'Keep The Faith', is the best album track gem Michael ever recorded. A really uplifting song and sung like no other in his career. The album is worth the price of purchase just for this gem and the title track. Which has an industrial funk feel to it. Although it could've been edited down by as much as 2 minutes and been a very strong single. It has one of the catchiest choruses ever. Get this album, it is the last of the essestial 4 albums Jackson recorded in his career.
0060955775|5.0|Once again, the great Paulo Coehlo brings us an extraordinary story. Veronica Decides to Die combines tragedy, love, friendship, spiritual growth, and energy all in one great ensemble. The twist at the end of this novel will leave you longing for Coehlo's next literary creation. The authenticity of this story is undoubtedly fascinating.
B0000025RI|5.0|To say any album is the greatest ever is always a matter of opinion. Critical or not. But this record remains a classic. Only 9 songs and nearly 60 million copies sold. I would say its continued success is a combination of 'Legend' and actual song quality. This album doesn't have a weak song & its strongest ones have taken on almost mythic status...songs like 'Billie Jean' , 'Beat It' & 'Thriller'. My personal favorite is 'Wanna Be Starting Something'. Just as in Elvis's case, when the legend became bigger than the man. The same fate has come upon Mr Jackson. Now beset by child abuse allegations and what-not. But this was his time, when he shined. And this is his masterpiece...
B000025XKM|4.0|The three records Nick Drake released were all unique and brilliant, but also seemed to strongly reflect the way his life was going. 'Five Leaves Left', his debut, was melancholic but it had a youthful freshness. In the song 'Fruit Tree' Drake spookily predicted his fate with pinpoint accuracy. Then on 'Bryter Layter', possibly his strongest album, Drake blossomed into everything Five Leaves Left signalled. Brighter songs and more upbeat tempo's saw him in a more optimistic light. Then, of course, came this. Pink Moon is an incredible album to hear. It contains songs that should be regarded as folk classics today. The title track is as accesible as it gets and what a wonderful song it is. The most fascinating thing about this album for me was Drakes frighteningly downbeat attitude. I got a feeling that Drake had reached his limit and just couldn't care anymore (in a good way). It's one of the most emotionally raw albums ever recorded. It's basically a collection of intimate solo recordings by a man no longer able to understand what he was doing wrong and why he wasn't being accepted for being the talent he was. Instrumentals like 'Horn' actually portray the way he must've been feeling even more than the tracks with lyrics. If you imagine songs like 'Free Ride' as huge stadium-rock monsters being covered by Led Zepellin you can actually realise their ultimate brilliance. Drake was most definitly the British Robert Johnson in this sense. The songs on this album are all excellent slices of folk rock. They could be taken by any band and made instant rock classics in my opinion, but I prefer them like this anyway. If you listen to 'Know', it might help you realise the mind-blowing power of raw simplicity.
B0002KVUKM|3.0|It had potential, but thyen it just... sucked. Ok, yes, pun intended. It's just, it was so very cheesy! It was a B grade movie with a big budget and great special effects. I couldn't believe I spent the money for it. If it had been advertised as the mockery it was, I would have loved it; but it was advertised as a serious monster flick and I was expecting something a little more ... serious. I just couldn't adapt in time. Maybe if I watch it again, knowing it's a sort of big-budget monster comedy with an \\"I'm ready for a sequel\\" ending, I'll like it for what it is; but I feel so decieved.<br /><br />I'm sure it will be a cult favorite. It's not badly done. It plays off every monster movie an dbook you ever even thought of, and then some. You can see the influence of the Matrix in places, and of all those late-night creepy flicks, and of everything else from James Bond to Harlequin Romance books. But it's really more of a patchwork of all those than a movie in it's own right.<br /><br />Oh, yes, and it had women in leather corsets for the boys in the audience. Musten't forget that.
B000089RVX|4.0|The bottom line for the Evanescence CD, Fallen, is that it is nothing but misery and depression expressed through the haunting, yet beautiful vocals of Amy Lee.  However that does not necessarily make it a bad album- <br /> <br />1. Going Under-The opening song.  This makes a huge difference in terms of the flow of the CD.  It is what defines the sound of the rest of the album (most times), and is crucial in grabbing the attention of the listener.  The title of the song itself is a premonition of the fact that the tone of the lyrics and music will be in fact 'going under', as in becoming darker, as the album progresses.  My rating-8/10 <br /> <br />2. Bring Me To Life-The album's single.  That's all there is to say about that.  You either like it, or you hate it.  My rating-3/10 <br /> <br />3. Everbody's Fool-I absolutely love the message of this song and how it expresses the evils of the consumer and how we worship all these idols just because of their material wealth and good looks.  My rating-8/10 <br /> <br />4. My Immortal-This song has been completely messed up ever since I began listening to Evanescence.  It is overplayed on the radio, the band version of this song is really bad, and no one even understands the true message of the lyrics.  It's not so much the fact that she's lost someone, but looking at the bright side, she knows that this individual's spirit is still alive in her, hence the title \\"My Immortal\\".  It would be considered a nostalgic song if people would examine this more closely.  A very depressing nostalgia, but she's trying to remember the good times they had together.  My rating-1/10 <br /> <br />5. Haunted-Finally, this is the part where the CD really begins to shift gears.  Not only does it become heavier, but the moods that are presented in this half are a bit more serious and dramatic.  This song speaks it's name.  The lyrics reflect a very dark and tormented soul.  My rating-10/10 <br /> <br />6. Tourniquet-I believe I heard the phrase \\"My God, return to me salvation\\" used in a church sermon.  Yes, this song is the most spiritual piece of the album.  I would agree with some of the other reviews that it helps to shed some light into the shadows of some of the lyrics.  My rating-8/10 <br /> <br />7. Imaginary-I love this song.  Again, the song speaks it's name, because it describes an 'imaginary' place that this individual has made up so that they can escape from all the evils in the world.  It's one of those songs that anyone can relate to whenever they want to feel safe, and just escape reality for just a few minutes.  My rating-9/10 <br /> <br />8. Taking Over Me-Very interesting lyrics.  A sort of longing is expressed in this song.  It is a longing for someone to be with a friend whose gone away.  The lyrics of this piece might be confused with an obsession, but you can see as the song progresses that it's only someone wishing the could see someone else for one last time.  My rating-8/10 <br /> <br />9. Hello-This is a much better piano ballad, as opposed to \\"My Immortal\\".  It's very melodic and much more quiet which I like to hear in any acoustic piece.  My rating-9/10 <br /> <br />10. My Last Breath-This is probably the strongest, and heaviest song on the album.  It deals with suicide, which is an extremely serious and personal subject.  The guitar riffs are intense, the strings sort of add a classical touch to it, and Amy's voice is very well harmonized, when layered with her already singing the melody.  My most favorite song on this album-10/10 <br /> <br />11. Whisper-I have no serious comment on this song, only that it sort of acts as an outro to the album, with nothing too significant in the lyrics that hasn't been touched upon earlier on the CD.  It's well put together, and the choir has a nice effect at the end.  My rating-7/10 <br /> <br />Overall, Evanescence did a nice job putting together this album.  It has it's own definative style, and it's refreshing in terms of listening to anew sound, provided you've never heard them before.  Fallen is a good CD, and I'm certainly looking forward to some new material from this band.
B0001BKAEY|4.0|This movie was, I think, better than the second but not as good as the first. Of course, the first was the right movie at the right time - an event that actually changed our perception of the world and the way the media dealt with us. No sequel could ever manage to live up to that. If all you saw of the world of the Matrix were the first two movies, then perhaps you were a little disapointed, and rightly so. But if you ever visited the web page, read the comics and short stories by everyone from Neil Gaiman to Popp Z Brite and loads of other famous authors and artist in between, this movie was true to the world of those stories.<br /><br />It was a good movie, although the religious imagery and ideology was a little strong in it (but that's been forshadowed since the beginning). It also reminds me of the story of the once and future king, of Arthur who will come again when he is needed most. And in the end, it has a place on my shelf with the first two.
0156027321|5.0|When an author can take an improbably story and make a skeptical reader suspend his disbelief, he's accomplished something.  When the author then takes that very fact and uses it for his own purposes at the end of the story, he's done something really special.    This is a special book.  It is an always-entertaining story of a young Indian boy set adrift on a lifeboat in the Pacific with a Bengal Tiger (why not?).  Beyond being a survival story, it is a story of maintaining hope, and in the end, a story about how you, the reader, view the world.    Not to be missed.
B00003CX8Y|5.0|THis is the best movie ever, with such a great timeless story, and the first cg, it has nothing to compare with.  I can watch this movie every day and never get bored.  The fight between good and evil is not the prevailing story as in most Disney movies, but the beauty within.  It has such a moving, thought provoking theme, that  adults can enjoy it just as much as children.  Great, great movie
0380715430|4.0|Ever wonder how and why we ended up speaking the way we do?  Here are your answers. <br /> <br />Bryson addresses which people and which languages came together to form the basis of the English we speak today.  He lays out the types of words that originate with the various groups and examines the process of word creation and the migration of words and pronuciation. <br /> <br />For anyone who likes language and would enjoy knowing more about how and when English came to this point, this is a good - and fun - read.
B000002UJQ|5.0|...this would definitely be the album I would take with me to listen.
B0002VL0KQ|5.0|The lyrics are heartfelt and the music is so sweet. This CD is an absolute staple for new parents. A compilation of perfect lullabies and beautiful pictures. I love it!
B00008H2LB|4.0|This album is a lot less fluid and rap influenced than \\"Hybrid Theory.\\" There's more real singing and there sure is a lot more yelling. Whether this a good thing or a bad thing, it's safe to say Linkin Park have survived their sophmore outing and escaped the \\"sophmore slump.\\" <br />After \\"Reanimation\\", I was wondering just how much Linkin Park were planning on using their guitars on their sophmore release. I was not a fan of \\"Reanimation.\\" I thought it was more of a techno/rap C.D. But, with \\"Meteora\\", it's also safe to say that the guitars are very much involved. <br /> <br />Highlights include: <br /> <br />\\"Somewhere I Belong\\" has a good intro which leads into the guitars. This song has pretty good rapping with good DJ scratches, but I must have heard this song too much or something, because now I hardly listen to anything past two minutes into the song (the teen angst yelling at the end gets on my nerves.) <br />\\"Lying from You\\" has another good intro (which makes a \\"beeping\\" noise), then explodes into the guitars. There are some good, swirling riffs and a couple of good DJ scratches on this song. <br />The guitars on \\"Hit the Floor\\" grind well (some are comparing this song to Pantera), while \\"Easier to Run\\" boasts an irresistable, sing along chorus with soaring vocals. All of which would've made this song a good single. Most of the songs on this C.D. are centered around a similar, big and catchy chorus. <br />\\"Faint\\" begins with what sounds like almost an orchestra, then turns to a typical rap/rock song. The rap on this one is smoothe and the yelling parts are towering, but what I enjoy most on this song is the catchy drum beat and the way the guitars start and stop. <br />However, there are some \\"Hybrid Theory\\"-esque moments: <br />\\"Breaking the Habit\\" is a personal favorite. It's a techno cut, making it a lot less subtle and less noisy than all the other songs. The vocals (which are usually rapped or screamed) are calmly sung over the soft strings, a repeating drum beat and DJ scratching. It's a personal favorite, even though it's techno, because it's very nearly danceable. <br />\\"Nobody's Listening\\" is more of a straight forward rap song, with another good chorus, while \\"Session\\" is an instrumental which echoes \\"Cure for the Itch\\". This song again shows us how talented the DJ (Joseph Hahn) is.  <br /> <br />But, for the most part, this album has less rap tempos, more powerful guitars and yelling. However there are some of moments (\\"Session\\", \\"Nobody's Listening\\") which are as fluid as anything on \\"Hybrid Theory.\\" Linkin Park have made more of a straight forward rock C.D., while also remaining true to their roots. The end result is a record which should please all of their fans. If you are sick of the radio singles, I urge you to check out the rest of the album, because there are several more good songs on here, and even a few great ones. However, if you didn't like \\"Hybrid Theory\\", don't expect this to change your mind.

B0000039PW|5.0|I grew up a tupac fan and as loyal as i was to tupac and his music i would never think i would end up listening to Ready to die but i did and i must tell ya that there is a big reason why the east use to claim Biggie as the easts tupac, however having said that now that i know biggie and tupacs rhymes and words, the main reason that Tupac will forever remain the greatest rapper of all time(and by the way those who think that b.i.g gets more respect than 'pac r jus kidding yourself) is because 2pac was way more deeper, 2pac would make you think for years and years about what he was sayin' and how real, raw and hardcore his words were, and b.i.g jus' made you like his music coz he had a mad flow and put good as rhymes together example 'gimme the loot' makes ya wanna go out and start robbin' and sh*t but yes Ready to Die does get 5 stars because you can tell that big knew what he was talking about and knew the ghetto and knew where he had come from and yes like many other rappers today incorporates it into his music but the difference is big did it much better then any other today and if you need any other convincing on that im sure 'every day struggle' will change your mind, if your west or east or any where round the world like i am i coz i aint come from america you need Ready to die
0800141660|5.0|Not to sound seriously sexist, but complicated romances are usually the subject of movies geared toward the feminine sensibility, as it were.  However, the incredible literacy of the source material, the wonderful performances (even Hugh Grant is delightful here, to say nothing of Thompson, Rickman, and Winslet), and Ang Lee's delicate touch, all make for a perfect film experience, in my opinion.  Jane Austen uses this dramatic comedy of manners to explore timeless facets of love, with TWO concurrent romances being pursued against the tides of prudence and social obligation endemic to the class and era.  The resolution of both of these romances is breathtakingly dramatic--most especially Thompson's emotional catharsis, which reflexively brings me to tears just thinking about it.   <br /> <br />The film also works as a sort of historic speculative fiction--imagine a world, before Freud and Oprah, when the cautious consideration of others' feelings was paramount, rather than the intemperate expressions of one's own.  Weird, isn't it? <br /> <br />In short, this is simply my favorite film of its genre ever, perfect in every way.  <br /> <br />
0790732254|4.0|The film of Edward Albee's drama \\"Who's Afraid Of Virginia Woolf?\\" is about the couple Martha and George who works in the History Department of a university in New England which Martha's father runs.  <br />One evening after a party they invite the new couple at the university, Nick and Honey, to have a little party after the party of Martha's father. During this \\"after-party\\" Martha and George start to argue and to swear at each other. Alcohol plays an important role now, because it flows like water and the situation comes to a head. Nick and Honey get involved in this marital row and many bad secrets come to light of all four of them. There is the imaginary son of Martha and George or Honey's \\"pregnancy\\", the reason for the marriage. This evening they wash their dirty linen in public.  <br />The film is full of suspense and speeds up with the conflict between the older couple which goes from bad to worse. It's often very funny, especially at the beginning, when the viewer is not used to the way, Martha and George talk to each other. But it sometimes is very dreadful, too, when the two accuse each other of their inadequacy. That is because they are disappointed with their life which ought to have a great future at their marriage.  <br />The actors, especially Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton, are a great profit for the film and are convincing the viewers.  <br />
1400031087|2.0|Writing should reflect the writer. In \\"A Million Little Pieces,\\" a story about his journey to sobriety after a 10-year addiction to drugs and alcohol, author James Frey certainly writes like an addict - arrogant, ruthless, shocking, exasperating and unbelievable - but never ashamed or contrite.<br /><br />Frey allegedly recovers but his brutal story doesn't because while there are many climaxes to his tale - anesthetic-free root canals, bloody and explosive vomiting, brawls and a litany of ugly and dehumanizing incidents - there is no real resolution.<br /><br />This book is classified as nonfiction with Frey elevating himself to hero status for single-handedly slaying his addiction demons. But to the exhausted reader, it's a joyless and soulless victory since there is no feeling of redemption.<br /><br />Frey's book is novel writing - in both senses of the word. And it probably would have been a far stronger story as an honest work of fiction in which the addict ultimately cons his final victim - himself. That story would have gotten five stars. This dishonest \\"memoir,\\" however, only rates two.
B00006LI4S|5.0|I've read many of the reviews stating that this effort by David Gilmour is markedly different than the same songs from his Pink Floyd days. I disagree. It is still rife with great songs, passion, and incredible musicianship. It may be primarily acoustic, but that only adds to the feeling that you're sitting front row watching a legend perform. <br /> <br />I think Gilmour has set the bar extremely high for intimate concert DVD's. His voice is still outstanding, even if he can't hit high notes as strongly as he used to. His backup vocalists are great. They remind me a lot of the background vocalists in the Roger Waters DVD \\"In the Flesh\\" (also excellent, although I prefer Gilmour's effort). At any rate, they add to the sound without overpowering anything. Gilmours band and array of guest singers and musicians blend in perfectly. Conversely, Waters voice has been much more profoundly affected by age. <br /> <br />My favorite tracks on this DVD include Coming Back to Life (my favorite), Smile, Terrapin, Shine on you Crazy Diamond, and Comfortably Numb. There is not a bad track on the DVD. <br /> <br />Soapbox: Those who believe Gilmour shouldn't be able to perform Pink Floyd efforts from the Roger Waters era are myopic. Gilmour co-wrote their songs, had a better voice, and is in my opinion one of the two greatest rock guitarists alive today (along with Mark Knopfler). Gilmour might not have written the words to the classic Floyd songs, but that is only a piece of the puzzle. His work on Animals, The Final Cut, Dark Side of the Moon, and Wish you Were Here is excellent. <br /> <br />I never thought I'd be a fan of concert DVD's, but seeing Gilmour perform this work adds so much. I give this my highest rating and feel that anyone who enjoys a great rock performance will be very satisfied. Part of me wishes he and Waters would patch up their differences and perform together again, although I'm sure nothing could match seeing Floyd in their prime. <br /> <br />A must buy.<br />
B00000I01A|4.0|Sylvestor Stallone sure knows how <br />to pick great artists to be on  <br />his flicks.  Some of the best <br />rock music comes from his <br />films, Rockys and Cobra. <br /> <br />These 3 top rock bands <br />u gotta check out.  <br />Their musicianships is <br />just phenomenal: <br /> <br />1/ Survivor (early albums, wow) <br />2/ John Cafferty (voice of Eddie & Cruiser, <br /> all his songs sounds like Springsteen + 60's) <br />3/ John Tepper (what a friggin' voice, dude rocks!) <br /> <br />Hey, if u into scores, u gotta check out <br />Bill Conti's work also.

0330412302|4.0|This is a very personal account of a girl growing up in Africa.  <br />Feels a lot like reading someone's diary, with the family's losses, grief, and subsequent functional breakdown exposed for all to see. <br />It's written truthfully, maybe too much so. <br />I was very absorbed by this book, but I'm not sure I can say I actually enjoyed it. <br />
B00005JNBQ|1.0|Giving this movie \\"1\\" star was difficult for me. Having never been moved enough to write an online review before, I was truly hoping you could give negative scores as ratings. Without going over an utterly rediculous storyline and the grossly exagerated characters found in this never-ending \\"drag-on and go nowhere\\" story, I will sum it up in one word \\"flop\\" <br /> <br />I am an avid movie-goer and dvd collector. It doesn't take an academy award winning performace to make me enjoy a movie. But this  movie was equal to me handing my 10 year old a camcorder and cutting him loose at home and school without edits!  This is the first movie I ever bought after hearing how \\"funny\\" it was and purposely scratching it so I could return it with my receipt to a local store.  It was THAT BAD!!!  If, like me you are still compelled to see the movie and no one was honest enough to warn you off, then spend as little money as possible, rent before you buy!!!  You will thank me later!
0689835604|4.0|lift-the-flap books are generally a huge hit with my 21-month old and this book is among his favourites ('Where is Spot?' being his absolute favourite). He loves pointing out his own belly button, eyes, ears, etc. and playing peekaboo alongside the babies in the book. <br />Fun and educational ... can't go far wrong with this book!

0590030299|4.0|The unusual, bold illustrations, the simple text, as well as the \\"educational value\\" (counting, days of the week, etc.) make this one of my favourites.<br /><br />My 21-month old son also loves it... especially sticking his fingers in the holes the caterpillar has left in the food (so do consider the board book if your child's the touchy-feely type!).<br /><br />A book I like to read with my son regularly and one I like giving as a gift to other mommies - it's usually a hit with their babies / toddlers too.
B0002IVN9W|5.0|The Arcade Fire really hit one out of the park with Funeral.  On a few tracks, you might notice a riff here and there that you've probably heard before.  What makes them stand out is the arrangement of all these disparate instruments to create this sort of post-punk orchestration, with almost operatic vocals in places, and vocals in other places that might remind you of something incredibly obscure... say Danielson Famile.<br /><br />This album starts off amazingly well, and by the third song, I was hooked.  It just kept getting better with each listen, as I noticed more details about each song.  Like a great movie, Funeral gets better each passing time.  There is just so much to take in, lyrically and musically.  Buy this album and listen to it front to back a couple of times, and you will understand why they are good.  They have songs that are upbeat and catchy, songs that are hopelessly beautiful, and songs that will utterly depress even the most optimistic.
0694003611|5.0|Although I didn't fall in love with this book on first sight, it has grown on me over time and it's now both my and my son's favourite bedtime read. <br />Its simple rhyme and illustration was an immediate hit with my toddler, and as the text is so minimal in relation to the pictures there's lots to look at (and say goodnight to!) and a new story to tell every night. <br />No wonder it's a classic! <br />
B0002Z0EYK|2.0|Brad Pitt and Olando Bloom are acting way too modern in this film, especailly Brad Pitt, I would admire the way he fight in the film but things he said and that manner is simply too unrealistic in an ancient sense, i found myself hardly believe they r from \\"the past\\" and that destroy everything to be expecting later. My only applause is on Eric Banna he delivered a believable character. Olando's role would somewhat reminds u his role in LOTR, a kid that good with bow, but the way the story let him kill Brad at the end is so cheesy, which doesnt draw out any emotional moment whatsoever, it makes a weak ending but nothing more. Poor effort for peter wolfstang, as his neverending story is still on today one of my best movie of all time, and the war scene... weak if you r comparing it to Ridley Scott's stuffs like \\"black hawk down\\" or mel gibson's \\"brave heart\\" or ridley's new \\"kingdom of the heaven\\".

0140177396|5.0|This is a stimulating story between close friend who accompanied each other at all times. It was an inspiring and affective book, one of the most impressive stories I have ever read. This is a spectacular book based on the best of friends who went through thrilling and sad striking events together. The theme of this book is based on loneliness, which i really can't relate to but have experienced it before. Everyone experiences loneliness once in a while. The characters played impressive parts and they were all acquainted with the theme. the characters that interested me the most were Lenny and Curley's wife. Lenny was a mentally ill-ed strong man who was dependent of George. Curley's wife was a lonely woman because she never had her husband around and she always stood home alone. She was trying to make friends with the only person she new would talk to her, Lenny. She wasn't aware of Lenny's strength and was murdered because of his fetish towards soft things. <br />From the reactions i received myself towards this book I give it five stars. This book showed me that everyone feels lonely once in a while but their are others who can experience loneliness in the worst ways of life.
0307120007|3.0|Looking at other reviews, it looks like I'm in the minority here, but my son doesn't really like this book. <br />I'd bought it for him when he was around a year old - at the time I figured that maybe he was too young for it (although he did enjoy other books), but at 21 months, he still doesn't like it. He likes the peek-a-boo, but that's about it.  <br />The only reason I can think of is that the soft colours don't really appeal to him. <br />
B000096I9G|5.0|For years, the idea of The Cure performing EVERY song from DISINTEGRATION in glorious order from beginning to end was a pipe dream of mine. Lo and behold!!! It happened. And they threw in two more sets: PORNOGRAPHY and BLOODFLOWERS. In their entirety. This performance is for music fans who love true ALBUMS with cohesive sound, feel, and theme. The Cure usually sound absolutely wonderful live and this performance is no exception.  <br />If the three sets aren't enough to convince you, the encore of \\"The Kiss\\" will make you cream your pants. Guaranteed.
B0000CAQ26|4.0|Well, Pink is ever the changing butterfly isn't she? She went from hip-hop/r&b to soft rock/pop to full out rock on her last three releases. This album is definitely a decent rock record worth your money. There are some tracks that leave a little to be desired but overall, it's all good. Tracks such as \\"God Is A DJ\\", \\"Waiting For Love\\", \\"Hooker\\"(hidden track), \\"Last To Know\\" and \\"Oh My God\\" are songs that will be stuck in your head for days. They are catchy, risque, and rock and roll. It's a shame that this record didn't fly like her last record because this one is real, 100% real. Looking forward to Pink's next release
B0002F7I9Y|4.0|Genius - you either have it or you don't.  And Ray Charles, my friend, had it -- whatever it is -- in spades.  Genius Loves Company makes for a rather apropos title.  I love the insert in the CD with the revealing and heartfelt quotes from the likes of such musical luminaries as Norah and JT as well as close friends such as B.B. King and Willie Nelson.<br /><br />While Ray's voice indisputably lacks the inherently effervescent soul of his younger years, his duets on this CD amazingly still evoke great passion and make for an incredibly soothing and relaxing listen - namely on such stand out tracks as Here We Go Again w/ Norah Jones, Fever w/ Natalie Cole, It Was a Very Good Year w/ Willie, and arguably the most sublime track(and my personal favorite) on the album, Sinner's Prayer w/ B.B. King.<br /><br />Order this along with the Ray! soundtrack -- you can't go wrong.
B0006284JQ|5.0|This is a great pop record and great for any fan of late nineties pop. It's also really a great snapshot of Ms. Spears' evolution after her rocket to fame. From the unforgettable first single, \\"...Baby One More Time\\" to her latest release, a cover of Bobby Brown's \\"My Prerogative\\". One must admit, pop culture in the late nineties and last five years would not have been the same if this girl from rural Louisiana had not exploded onto the music scene. Highlights of this album would be her two newest tracks \\"Do Somethin'\\" and \\"(I've Just Begun)Having My Fun\\" along with chart-toppers \\"Toxic\\", \\"Oops!...I Did It Again\\" and \\"I'm A Slave 4 U\\". I know alot of people criticize Ms. Spears for lack of singing talent. Well I will admit that she is not the best vocalist out there but she can sing. She does have a lot of back tracking on her songs, but you know what....it's just fun pop songs. Take it for what it is and you'll have a great time with this record, as well as it's amazing remixes on the bonus disc!
B0002KPIQY|5.0|i think is a great story!  and angelina played the part perfectly!  i've seen this a trillion times and would see it a trillion more.  it's a story that teaches you something by just being real.  nothing is hidden.  i think it's a movie that everyone should see to bring better understanding to everyone about AIDS.

B0006399FS|1.0|Nowhere near what old U2 was. Doesn't Deserve the One Star I'm Forced to Give <br /> <br />The hype this time killed the actually receiving of said wanted item. On my first play of U2's latest album, How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb, I was incredibly disappointed. It's instantly recognisable as a U2 album. There's Edge's trademark guitar playing, and Bono's pleading, coaxing lyrics. There's the return of the usual themes of love, longing, spirituality and being lost. With the middle section of \\"Vertigo\\" taken from the Boy album, it even borrows from previous U2 songs. <br /> <br />How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb is probably the most commercial album that U2 have ever put out. This is not the album of a band trying to reaffirm their status of rock gods by exploring whole new sounds. This is an attempt to please everyone. The tracks are all safe and mainstream radio-friendly. Hurts to even listen to samples found here. <br /> <br />Most the album is mainly made up of slower tracks and ballads. These are too frequently unmemorable and mediocre. They sound like they should be on a film soundtrack as background music. U2 used to have a reputation for being different, for creating new sounds. Think of \\"Miami\\", \\"Numb\\", \\"lemon\\", \\"Discotheque\\", \\"Zoo Station\\", \\"Elvis Presley and America\\", etc. U2 were frequently criticised for their musical diversions, but at least in the past they tried. <br /> <br />All the fame and money has turned a once great band into a pathetic joke of their former glory.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B0006399FS|1.0|Wow what can I say about this album except its utter regurgitated rubbish.  \\"How to dismantle an atomic bomb?\\" Jesus Christ can they flippin be a little more original with the album names.  Like 50 bands between 2003-2004 release albums that had title names like..\\"The art of this...\\", and \\"The science of that\\", and \\"How to do more crap..\\" I mean could u stop the melange of blandness already! Has anyone actually listened to or read the lyrics to Vertigo? Turns out its the most trite piece of crap lyrics I've ever read in my life.  Eventhough that's pretty much the only song I've heard off this new album I get this terrible feeling that U2 has pretty much lost all their originality by now.  Oh well, some things are too good to be true...U2 is was of em

B00005GL0P|5.0|Before the release of \\"Rubber Soul\\" Rock and Roll was considered just a simply temporal consume product, when artists released singles for the season and this singles were available in little vinyl formats that after the season were just thrown away and never played or even remembered again , was not untill the Beatles created this awesome album that Rock and Roll entered into the contemporary popular culture , then albums became subject of cult and years later adopted several forms like conceptuall albums (Beatles were the first on this also) double albums (again the Beatles were the first) and many other concepts that were developed after , albums have been apreciated as complete masterpieces since then and not just singles, Beatles became more mature persons, musicians and song writters , influenced by introspection as in \\"think for yourself\\", groovy rithms like in \\"drive my car\\" american country sounds as in \\"what goes on\\" , indian sitar as in \\"norwegan wood\\" (wich contained the elements of Bob Dylan style by the way), ballads were also improved like \\"michelle\\", and folk rithms are also a part of this production , Beatles showed all the environments that sorrounded them , indian philosophy , american styles etc, the escence of 60s started to be evident in that days , Rubber Soul is a basic album to understand the path that music choosed by this influence in the decades that came after this release. <br />HM

0767834739|1.0|Let me first take a second just to say that i have never written a movie review in the past, but i am a person that when extremely pleased or highly dissatisfied often feels the need to say something, so here it is: This movie is without a doubt one of the most worst action/horror/scifi/whatever the hell peice of crap kinda movie you want to call it. What bothered me most outside of the huge plot holes was that this movie was a horrid rip of of ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK (which i will add was a much better movie by far than this piece of tripe). What the producers of this movie relied on was the fact that the audience they were going after (young males 16-25) probably have never seen or heard of the movie ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK thus wouldnt know that there wasnt one single fresh or original idea in the whole movie. Yes it was nice seeing Alice and Valentie (pretty faces and nice bodies to attract the boys) kick some butt, ill admit, but when you actualy go to the lengths of stealing another persons movie idea you'd think they could at least make the plot work (i.e. to reanimate dead bodies they MUST be infected with the T-Virus, yet when the wayward team are running through a grave yard, corpes come up from the ground. Can someone please tell me how they, 1) got out of ther coffins from 6 feet down, and then tell me how they were infected with the T-virus?)I wont bore you with more details of the dreadfulness of this rip off, my only point was to warn any of you Resident Evil 1 fans that were thinking of picking this up (by the way i did like part one)If you really want to see a better version (AND NOT A RIPPED OF PIECE OF GARBAGE) of what was meant in APOCALYSE, rent or buy ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK with Kurt Russell, i think you will be pleasantly surprised.

B000003S5H|3.0|60's lounge jazz, electronica, Pink Floyd and Europop might make for strange bedfellows, but on much of this CD, French duo Air turn it into a pretty interesting and entertaining mixture.  I agree with several other reviewers regarding Beth Hirsch's vocals.  Every once in a while when I listen to those 2 songs they seem to fit but most of the time they just annoy me.  The 2 tracks are easy enough to program out though, which leaves you with a decent CD.  The opening 7-minute \\"La Femme D'Argent\\" and \\"Talisman\\" are Floyd-y instrumentals sure to please old prog fans like myself.  Most of the vocoder-ized songs are just OK but of them I really like the atmospheric \\"New Star in the Sky.\\"  But my absolute favorite track of all, oddly enough, is the short, straight-ahead lounge song, \\"Ce Matin La,\\" with a beautifully low-key melody played by a muted tuba (!)  It's like Henry Mancini on 'ludes and it kills me every time I hear it.  A whole CD of that stuff would get 5 stars from me if it was all as high quality.<br /><br />What makes this CD interesting to me is the way that Air played all of this on actual instruments (with guests), rather than going the usual route of this type of band and just sampling it all.  Sounds like they used some seriously retro instruments too!  It's the live-instruments flavor that makes this of some interest to prog fans, as well.  The Fender Rhodes, MiniMoog and Mellotron all make appearances here and are nicely used.<br /><br />I really can't give this CD more than 3 stars given it's flaws, the usually bad vocals and cheesy vocoder Europop tendencies, but let me say this:  tracks 1,5,8,9 and 10 make a nice 23-minute or so listening experience if you burn or program them that way.  I'd give that theoretical mini-album 4 1/2 stars.
0790732254|4.0|\\"Who's afraid of Virginia Woolf?\\" &#8211; Edward Albee's picturized drama shows that it is not always easy to live your life after the standard of the \\"American Dream\\".  <br /> <br />After a party Martha and George invite a young couple to have just a few drinks and have some fun. But it is just the other way round: The more alcohol they drink the more open the conversation becomes. Especially Martha and George begin to curse at each other. When the situation escalates Honey and Nick, who had by the time the chance of making the \\"American Dream\\" come true, are already involved in the bad marital quarrel. Nobody is in the position to save the day and so all the things they have hide behind their marriages are discovered.For example, Honey and Nick get to know that the \\"kid\\" Martha and George are arguing about the whole time is just imaginary or reversed that Nick just had married Honey because of her false pregnancy. <br /> <br />Even if you have already read the drama the film is worth watching.Especially Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton overtop in their roles of an disputing married couple. With their excellent skill of insulting each other , the facial expression and gesture the viewers can easily put theirselves in Martha's and George's position. <br />

B00008PX8P|5.0|I'm a 26 year old die-hard Zeppelin fan, and have been since I was about 12.  I'd heard many bootlegs and have never been let down at their performances, but this DVD is head and shoulders above anything they've released.  I bought it the day it came out and still listen to it all the time.  If you've never heard Led Zeppelin, don't worry if you're getting your money's worth, just by it.  You will not be disappointed.  I've \\"forced\\" all my friends to listen to this DVD and even those who don't even like Zeppelin are amazed.  I don't remember how many jaws I've seen drop during the \\"Dazed and Confused\\" DTS surround violen bow solo or the slide guitar during \\"In My Time of Dying.\\"  This DVD for me was as satisfying as when I was first discovering their studio work.  No matter how often I watch this, I still find myself amazed at the great music these four musicians made.  There is a reason this DVD became the highest selling music DVD ever within months of it's release, Led Zeppelin were and are the greatest rock band ever, without a doubt.  When you consider originality, talent, sales figures, image, sound quality of releases, mystique, etc... they can't be touched.  Go to any mall and you're likely to see 13 year boys and girls with Zeppelin shirts. In conclusion, click \\"add to cart\\" and buy this DVD.  If you think there is a chance in hell you maybe could possibly like this, then I guarantee you will be addicted to this DVD.
B00000HZH7|4.0|This is really a death-thrash album, but it's death metal enough to be considered the first DM album ever.  However, I can't really say how influential this album was. 'Scream Bloody Gore' is much better known, of course, and thus is more directly influential, but I don't really know how much influence this album had on Death's debut, as Death had been around for as long as Possessed had been, and at least some of the material from that album had been written prior to this one's release.(Evil Dead, for example. Probably others)  Whatever the case may be, serious metal fans will likely wanna pick this up for due to historical significance alone.<br /><br />This album is unbelievably ahead of it's time, as it's death metal from even before thrash metal had truly matured.  It's also incredibly heavy for the time, and would not be topped for another 2 years. (Well, 'Darkness Descends' might be heavier. It's a tough call) Stylistically, this album is basically 'Fight Fire With Fire' with a deeper guitar tone and death vox played ten times in a row.  The vox aren't quite as gruff as your average DM band, but they're DM vox, no question.  The guys in this band were a bunch of high school kids, so it isn't as sophistacated as lots of other albums, but it's not really amateurish or simplistic either.  The exception to this is the drumming, which is kinda weak, and rather holds the album back.  An overproduced sound, weak fills etc.  Still, the vicious guitars and twisted vox carry the day.  There are some decent solos as well.  Nothing too complex, of course, but actually reasonably clean and melodic.  Most of the songs have a reasonably catchy chorus, but it has no real variety.  The opener, 'The Exorcist' and 'Seven Churches' are probably the two best tracks, with the title track being the better of the two.(Beccera's howling 'YOU WILL DIE!!!!' jumps out at you everytime you listen to this album.  It's definitely the best, and the defining moment of the album)  It's all solid enough, of course, but not much really stands out. Still, sounds good while you're listening to it, which is good enough.<br /><br />Yeah, that's it.  Good, not great, but worth checking out.gh, of course, but not much really stands out. Still, sounds good while you're listening to it, which is good enough.        Yeah, that's it.  Good, not great, but worth checking out.
B000003CMB|5.0|This is definitely one of the band's finest recordings.  I first got this on cassette when I was young but was too immature to appreciate most of the music.  As the years passed I grew fonder and fonder and eventually got the CD after the cassette wore out.<br /><br />Greg is a great blues singer (a guy that ugly has gotta be), and Dickie and Duane play dueling Les Paul's on 23+ minute Whipping Post.  T-Bone Walker's \\"Stormy Monday\\" has been recorded over and over again by almost every blues artist.  However, this is without a doubt my favorite version of the song.<br /><br />It's been over 30 years.  This is still one of the finest rock and blues live performances.
B0002XVQNU|5.0|This director's cut, which was the original version the director Mark Steve Johnson wanted, is amazing!  This version elevates the Daredevil movie to Spider-man 2 levels!  While I'd give the theatrical version about three stars, the director's cut is easily 4 1/2 to 5 stars. <br />     The character of DD was almost completely neglected in the theatrical cut.  Not to spoil much but this director's cut reveals DD's keen detective skills, superhero ethic and sense of humor that were ignored in the theatrical.  (i.e. in one part when Foggy questions Matt about scars he sometimes gets, Matt replies \\"I'm in Fight Club.  The first rule of Fight Club is don't talk about Fight Club.  So, I can't talk to you about it.\\"  It's funny!) <br />     Futhermore, the director's cut story actually makes sense!  You'll see how the police actually caught onto Kingpin, why Ben Urich gives Matt his number at the party, etc. <br />     The bottomline is that the studio were idiots for messing with the original cut of DD and coming up with the relatively pathetic theatrical cut.  If this were the version released in theaters, in 2003, DD would be infinitely more popular and I have no doubt the movie would have made much more money.  The difference in the two DD cuts goes to show that business people have no clue about how to make a good movie.
B0000TB050|5.0|this is a must have for all true U2 fans..the show from Slane Castle was unbelieveable and the band plays all of their hits from earlier cd's such as the Joshua Tree all the way through to the latest from the All That You Can't Leave Behind cd...this dvd will help you realize why you fell in love with them in the first place
0446310786|5.0|This story has always been like a sacred parable for me. The  semi-autobiographical by Miss Lee encapsulates just about every nuance of human nature and morality worth describing. No wonder she decided that she needn't write another book. The heroes: Scout, Jem, Boo and Addicus are like shining lights in the midst of a world gone morally dark. The morality is as apt today as it ever was; only the names and faces have changed. Maybe the human story is allowed to endure only through the grace extended to a moral Minority.
B000669GAI|4.0|To clear up some of the things other reviewers have been saying/complaining about: <br /> <br />The remixed tracks (Once, Alive, Black) are definitely marked improvements on the original versions, removing that '90's production sheen that makes Ten stand apart (soundwise) from every other Pearl Jam release. Black is the most notable improvement out of the three. <br /> <br />The version of Even Flow included on this set is the much better and harder-to-come-by re-recorded version that is currently played on alot of rock stations. It is also the version that appears in the promotional video for the track. I spent years hunting down this track (finally finding it on a Japanese single) and I consider it a great thing that it is included on this set. <br /> <br />The way the discs are divided (Disc One is the \\"Up Side\\" (uptempo tracks) and Disc two is the \\"Down Side\\" (slower tracks), which makes for a very cohesive flow for each disc.  <br /> <br />The only reason I give this collection four stars instead of five is for the glaring omission of the hit single, Love Boat Captain. I realize alot of key tracks are missing in the eyes of the hardcore fan, but Love Boat Captain was actually a hit and one of Pearl Jam's most poignant and powerful tracks. <br /> <br />And for the record, I don't think Pearl Jam okay-ed this release to collect a paycheck. Usually when a band is parting ways with it's record company after an extended relationship, the band will release a greatest hits to fulfill the contract so they can release their new material on whatever label they change to. At least Pearl Jam put some worthwhile stuff on this so that their dedicated fans have a little treat.
B00004YA66|5.0|What if you could change the past?  Fireman, John Sullivan did not die in a warehouse fire because of information from his son in the future.  John is a fireman, who takes high risks to save people, in the first scene where John saves a group of workers trapped under a leaking fuel tank; the fuel tanker accident takes place at a road construction project, the tanker is about to explode, electric wires threaten to ignite the fuel, and John must pry open a steel door and carry injuried man out, who later manages to start running just before the explosion.  How does a injured man manage to run out just before the explosion?  John hero courage and valor allow him to escape death from a exploding fuel tanker.<br /><br />It would seem at first time modification would bring a happy ending, however, the paradox of changing the past to improve the future leaves one reflecting on the complex of time and space.  The movie has some Ham radio humor, as John says, \\"we must be talking of the mother of all sun spots.\\"  In order to go back in time frequency of the radio waves would have to exceed the speed of light.  It seems the radio wave enters a worm hole through a sun spot and emerge out the sunspot in a different time.  So, if space time could wrap around on its self then traveling along the course would take the person back and orth from the past to the future and the future to the past.  The irony of the thought being that the events in the past and future could change the space time topology.<br /><br />John does not die in the warehouse fire; John manages to find a grain slide and escape down it into the bay below;  John loves his wive and wants to see her immediately; John visits his wife, a nurse, at the hospital; if he had died, she would not have been at the hospital; as, a result she saves a serial killers live, Jack;  John Jr realizes the past has changed an made the future worst;  Jack in the future increased his killings from three to ten;  John Jr tells his father they must stop the killer to save the mother's life;  John Jr discovers that the killer Jack killed his mother a nurse;  John Jr discloses the address and name of the first victim; John is discovered by Jack and loses in a fight with Jack and Jack steals his drivers license; John Jr, uses a finger left by Jack on John's wallet; the finger print is traced to Jack, a dirty cop; Jack has been living off disablity and stacking nurses;  John can not stop Jack and Jack kills the first victim and when John arrives an eye witness places him at the crime scene;  John predicts the outcome of the mets game to his black cop friend; John's wife arrives and the black cop takes her aside to watch the game and tell her John is a suspect in the killings;  this gives Jack a chase to question John at gun point;  Jack wants to know how John knows about him and tries to kill John at the police station;  Jack is interrupted by a fellow officer; this give John a chance to improvise a defense using wires from the fuse box and airconditioning unit;  John manages to electrocute Jack with the wires, start the fire alarms, and manages to escape;  John reverse the tide by gaining access to information about Jack's residence from information in his wallet;  Jack discovers John in his apartment and the shooting starts;  Jack chases John and they end up fighting in the water, John takes a steel bolt to Jacks head and it seems Jack is dead;  John Jr does not understand why the mothers picture has not been restored and tells John something is wrong when suddenly Jack appears in both time periods and attacks;  because John had fixed the ham radio his tools were on the desk and because he was alive, John manages to escape;  John shoots off Jacks right hand which helps John Jr escape the attack by Jack in the future; and the best part is everyone made a ton of money off Yahoo.st stop the killer to save the mother's life;  John Jr discovers that the killer Jack killed his mother a nurse;  John Jr discloses the address and name of the first victim; John is discovered by Jack and loses in a fight with Jack and Jack steals his drivers license; John Jr, uses a finger left by Jack on John's wallet; the finger print is traced to Jack, a dirty cop; Jack has been living off disablity and stacking nurses;  John can not stop Jack and Jack kills the first victim and when John arrives an eye witness places him at the crime scene;  John predicts the outcome of the mets game to his black cop friend; John's wife arrives and the black cop takes her aside to watch the game and tell her John is a suspect in the killings;  this gives Jack a chase to question John at gun point;  Jack wants to know how John knows about him and tries to kill John at the police station;  Jack is interrupted by a fellow officer; this give John a chance to improvise a defense using wires from the fuse box and airconditioning unit;  John manages to electrocute Jack with the wires, start the fire alarms, and manages to escape;   John reverse the tide by gaining access to information about Jack's residence from information in his wallet;   Jack discovers John in his apartment and the shooting starts;  Jack chases John and they end up fighting in the water, John takes a steel bolt to Jacks head and it seems Jack is dead;  John Jr does not understand why the mothers picture has not been restored and tells John something is wrong when suddenly Jack appears in both time periods and attacks;  because John had fixed the ham radio his tools were on the desk and because he was alive, John manages to escape;  John shoots off Jacks right hand which helps John Jr escape the attack by Jack in the future; and the best part is everyone made a ton of money off Yahoo.
B00005JN2Z|5.0|Unlike most thrillers of our day, Collateral actually makes attempts at character development, and for the most part succeeds. <br /> <br />Jamie Fox plays the cabbie Max, a man who dreams of setting up his own limo business by saving up his taxi job money. Unfortunetely he's been at the business for some time, and so far no closer to his goal. But then Vincent (Tom Cruise) steps into his car. He sets the terms simply: five stops, six hundred dollars. Skeptical of his client, Max accepts and begins his trip into the night-world of hitmen and crime. <br /> <br />Taking place in a single LA night, Collateral packs a bunch into a two hour movie but does so without our knowledge. I was transfixed with the portrayals of the reluctant and tense Max and the icy-cool, homicidal Vincent.  <br /> <br />While the beginning is mainly character and a few spaced out hits, the real acceleration into the climax begins as Vincent and Max escape into an LA nightclub with police hot on their tail. I recommend this to most who wish to watch a thriller with a fairly good character development stage (save for Vincent who is introduced quickly and simple in character). <br /> <br />My one comment is on the super adrenaline-powered rage Vincent succumbs to while his neck bleeds from a close-range pistol wound. I would think someone would fall down severely injured, if not on death's door, when you're neck is nearly blow out.
0156027321|5.0|A great story narrated by a great story teller, January 13, 2005  Reviewer: Rao Venugopal \\"Venu\\" - See all my reviews        The Life of Pi is a book that I read recently after falling off the reading habit. If you have been in that situation and are thinking to yourself \\"gosh, i wish i could read one great book that would give me a spark and put me back in the reading groove...\\", this is IT.    At one level, it is an extremely fun and leisurely read and I found myself laughing out alound several times.  It is about the events in the life of a boy(Pi) which precede and take place during his life as a castaway.     The book is written in a absorbing and endearing style, in the first person, and it is easy to bond with the boy Pi.  The author's rich and vivid writing style makes the story come alive and his use of imagery is mind blowing.  For example, the scene where a hyena eats a zebra inside-out is written indelibly in my mind.    At another level, it is a uplifting story of perseverance, faith and the indomitable human spirit. Makes one want to believe.    Finally, the author throws a curveball in the last few pages when he spins another story, \\"a more believeable story...\\".    So which one do you believe?    This book will make you think and question. Great for discussing with friends or amongst a reading group.    Word of advice :- Read the book carefully

0671027387|5.0|This is a great summer read. My first read of one of Dan Brown's novels. I had no idea what to expect. It was my first foray back into the reading world after a decade long hiatus. This is the book kick-started my desire to read again. I'm fairly confident it will do it for others.<br /><br />Rachel Sexton is the daughter of power-hungry Senator Sedgewick Sexton, who's pushing to oust the current US president, Zach Herney. She gets put onto a fact-finding team to validate a finding my NASA. It is here that she's thrown into the freezing fray of the Arctic Circle with popular oceanographer Michael Tolland. Together they're thrown into a whirlwind of consipiracy, as the fact-finding mission becomes far more grand in scope than they had initialy expected.<br /><br />Full of action, deception, and controversy. Just the things that make up a compelling novel. A great fast book for the casual reader.
0767834739|4.0|Paul Anderson to me is a guy movie director: he doesn't make 3 hour long character studies or big period pieces, he just wants to have 90 minutes to show people kicking ass and blowing s*** up. Story may be very one dimensional, as are its characters, and dialogue may be hokey, but if I turned off my brain, I actually could enjoy this. <br /> <br />Resident Evil the first film was essentially a prequel to the first Resident Evil game which took place in the Spencer mansion. The movie was written to provide a prologue to the game even though there's Resident Evil Zero but oh well.  <br /> <br />After the events of the first film, Alice, having woken up from some experiments done to her, she awakes to find Raccoon City looking decimated(kind of like RE2 and 3). Umbrella wants to know what happened in the Hive so they open it's huge doors, bad idea. The \\"zombies\\"(they're not called that in the films) attack the scientists and start to overrun the city. The city people then go to the city's only exit, but someone contracts the virus and turns into one of them. Umbrella decides that it's too dangerous to have the virus this close so they do the next best thing to get rid of it: nuke the city. What follows is a group of people trying to escape without getting infected or killed and rescuing the T-Virus creator's daughter. <br /> <br />The plot is basically Resident Evil 3: Nemesis. There's no mention of William Birkin, Leon, or Claire. It does have Carlos Olivera and Jill Valentine from RE3(the latter also being in the first game). Not an important thing but Jill is HOT. Oded Fehr plays Carlos with a badassness and Milla Jovovich is quite capable in the movie-only character Alice. The big creature is the Nemesis, who transformed from Matt from the first movie. He looks like the game's character and has a rocket launcher and mini-gun. <br /> <br />Instead of Paul directing the sequel, the reins are given to Alexander Witt, a long-time second unit director but first time head director. He sometimes has a tendency to have the fast editing syndrome that plagues a director like Michael Bay with fast shots. This makes the fight with Alice and the Nemesis kind of weird too watch cause he's so damn slow yet it's shot like he's going Bruce Lee on her. <br /> <br />They're making a 3rd one with Paul returning as director. Seeing as how Resident Evil 4 just very recently came out, I'm wondering how it'll have its plot turn out. And here's to having Claire, Chris, Ada and especially Rebecca in the next film. But as for this one, give it a shot since it won't do anything bad and may enjoy it(except if you think the movie sucks).
0743442539|5.0|I've just started reading again about 4 months ago. I've stayed with fiction and have seen some ups and downs in the books I've read. I confess, I look around here to see what books avid readers recommend, and I compare that with my taste to pick one.<br /><br />So, when I saw John LeCarre's name in another review, I checked out the book titles and found this one. Let me tell you, I'm quite happy I decided to read it!<br /><br />As one reviewer before me put it, this is NOT your typical protagonist. Entertainment (books and novels, for the most part) follows a simple guideline, it seems. Cool protagonist, disliked antagonist, predictable ending. Not this one.<br /><br />Alec Leamas is an aged \\"case worker\\" for the Circus (basically London's spy agency) who's just come up short on his last assignment, and expects to be discarded after his last failure. What he finds is one more voyage into the fray.<br /><br />LeCarre's character development is pretty good, and the sense of feeling he gives the protagonist is genious. As said similarly in the book, the reader is between the carrot and the stick. LeCarre gives moments of shock, panic, and rarely a sense of comfort.<br /><br />To my best guess, this is what it feels like to be a spy. Something rarely found in spy novels these days. A good purchase for someone to add pages of intellect to their library.<br /><br />For another good one, check out Robert Ludlum's \\"Gemini Contenders.\\"
B0002EXH5O|5.0|I love this album, its my favorite Megadeth. I guess its the most thrashing out of all of them, even though all the others are good albums, too. If you are a Mega fan but don't have this, then buy it right away. The remastering was done very well and I don't care what anyone says, the re-done vocals are better quality and sound better. In my opinion, Holy War's... Punishment is Due is like Metallica's Enter the Sandman but Holy War's kicks its [...]!! If you are disappointed by System Has Failed, or Risk, then listen to this one!
6305311463|5.0|I love this film. Some of my friends and colleagues (quite a few in fact) believe this movie to be one of the corniest and sappiest movies ever made, I say to you all, stop, chill out and see this movie for what it is, Hollywood cinema at it's patriotic, rip roaring roller coaster best. Nerds, if it bothers you that any film seems 'filled with factual errors and flaws' and you crave scientific fact, this is probably not the movie for you, go watch the Discovery channel instead. For those that want to immerse themselves in an action / adventure movie second to none, crank up your home theatre system and let Bruce, Billy Bob, Ben, Liv and the living legend that is Steve Buscemi take you on an action packed journey to save the earth. The special effects are excellent and there is a second disc with some good commentary from the cast, producer and NASA consultants brought in to help on the project. All in all Critereon have managed to make an excellent film even better. A must for your collection.

0060005424|5.0|I was so eager to delve back into the world of the Old Kingdom that when my copy of Lirael arrived in the mail in the form of a Christmas present from my grandmother, I was desperate to get a hold of it.  After a day of begging four days before Christmas, my mother reluctantly shook her head in a \\"yes\\" and I dashed to the present and then ran upstairs and locked myself in my room. Garth Nix once again amazes me at his storytelling abilities.  Lirael was a fully realized character full of desperate wants that ultimately will not be filled.  The intricate plot once again was ingenious, preluding events to come in the slightest bits of foreshadowing. The magic is so real and somewhat dangerous, the plot superb, and the world as solid as the charter itself.  I have a slight feeling of melancholy as I put off reading Abhorsen, the last title of this breathtaking trilogy, wishing that it would never end.  Garth nix offers a tale that reassures your feeling that your are in for a tale of destiny, magic, and wonderful entertainment.  Lirael is true winner, a worthy sequel to the excellent Sabriel, and it met and exceded my every want and need.
B00008S2VG|2.0|Time to go back to the empty-headed pop fare she is known for. She tries to be taken seriously on A.L...but unfortunately the results are half-baked pop tunes with a potpourri of electronica and rap, no less. Madge needs to leave the rappin' to Lil Kim and Missy Elliot. When you're not blessed with a great singing voice like Madonna, and have a very limited vocal range, then it's best to go back to the dance songs.
0553579908|5.0|The first book in this series set up a clear precedent in terms of Martin's writing style. This author likes to carry the reader through the action using the perspective of different characters, has no qualm in killing characters that would never die in most fantasy series, and enjoys shocking his audience with totally unforeseen events. In the end of \\"A Game of Thrones\\" we find out that dragons have just returned to this world, fact that left most readers eager to jump right into \\"A Clash of Kings\\" as soon as they could.<br /><br />Summer has ended after more than ten years, and everyone is getting ready for the long winter that is certainly coming. But there are other much more important things to consider, because after the death of King Robert, the Seven Kingdoms are divided once more. Joffrey was named King, but there are already people challenging his right to the throne on the basis that his mother, Cersei, has not borne any children by King Robert. All the kids are the result of Cersei's affair with her brother Jaime, and this is slowly becoming vox populi.<br /><br />Joffrey is being challenged from multiple fronts, Stannis and Renly, King Robert's brothers, are both seeking to rule in the Seven Kingdoms. Meanwhile, Robb Stark is consolidating his power in the North and is ready to fight. Of course there are other layers that complicate matters even more, since Robb holds Jaime Lannister as a prisoner, while Cersei controls the destiny of Robb's sister, Sansa. The girl is betrothed to Joffrey, but now she does not want to be his wife anymore and is being held against her will.<br /><br />Gendry, Robert's illegitimate child and real heir to the throne does not even know about his rights, and has been taken out of King's Landing by a company that is traveling towards the Wall to join the Black. Arya is also part of this group, traveling disguised as a boy and trying to escape unharmed from Cersei's reach. The only other character that I feel must be mentioned is Tyrion, Cersei's brother, and new Hand of the King. This misshapen dwarf is my favorite character so far because of his intelligence and the way in which he compensates for his physical disabilities with his crafty schemes. I also like the fact that it is almost impossible to determine whether he is using his ploys to go about his evil ways or to find justice for those that deserve it.<br /><br />This duality in most of the characters is one of the main factors that make this series so enjoyable. It is uplifting to find an author that has no fear from separating himself from the traditional good vs. bad pattern and presents the readers with more human characters, who possess both good and bad qualities. There is no question in my mind about the quality of this sequence: it is one of the best fantasy series out there. I understand that some people may find some of the language to be offensive and some of the scenes depicted by Martin to be too brutal. I am not bothered by this; but even those who are should know that there are so many outstanding features in this work, like the rich plot, the incredibly depth characters, the relentless action and the superior narration, that make this and the others novels in the series worth reading.ther, and new Hand of the King.

B00005Y228|4.0|This album came out the same day as Cher's dance dominated album in 2002.  But this is one of Kylie's best albums. In fact, 3 years since it came out, most of the songs are still in my head!  Can't Get You Out of My Head is still in my head, but I like the other songs more.  Especially More, More, More, Fragile, the going on Hwy 101 in California feel of Your Love, Love Affair (which I still love), In Your Eyes, Dance Floor,  Fever, and others. Kylie won back her American audiences (myself included) with this album and she is a superb artist. Her Body Language album of last year is also good, but it is no contest to Fever.

Little Sarah Bolger is a scene stealer that could melt the most frigid of hearts.<br /><br />Mateo is the tortured artist/neighbour who is first befriended by the children then the parents. He gives them a new perspective on life and living. Mateo is played by Djimon Hounsou the \\"Not yet\\" actor from Gladiator. Djimon is thrilling and captivating as he is in all his movies.<br /><br />This story is beautifully written, casted and filmed. It was written and directed by Jim Sheridan and is pseudo-autobiographical. Sheridan is know for his writing and direction of In the Name of the Father and My Left Foot. He wrote In America with his daughters Naomi and Kirsten.<br /><br />The movie's characters are transformed by many human emotions: love, friendship, grief, forgiveness, rediscovery, mutual respect, and laughter. Be prepared to laugh and cry sometimes both at the same time but at the end your heart will feel fuller.
B0006HXXBA|5.0|Now let me tell you. This album kicks serious ass. Now if you don't know who kreator is and you like metal than you are just fool. Kreator are the thrash kings for the past 20 years. So listen to any to their cd, all of them are good. You won't be disapointed. Especially the last two are the best ones. There isn't enough words to compare this guys to anything they are just to godly to describe. So listen to their fans and buy this album. And when you like them, (a lot) make sure you go and buy their live dvd. which is another masterpiece.
B00007M5CO|5.0|This album is so cool... I've never heard a mix like that: ELECTRONIC + TANGO. Excellent fusion! And good songs too! I recomend it.
B00005JMAH|3.0|The movie was acted out Very Well from certain characters... another great performance from the trio Harry (Daniel) Ron (Rupert) and Hermoine (Emma) and from other members of the cast..McGonagal Hagrid Sirius Snape ect..who give the Movie the feel of the book.    However i would say i was dissapointed with the rest the first time i watched it..i was sorley dissapointed! The transiton from Columbus to Curano is very evident. I think it really failed to portray the quality of the novel which i still do after watching it twice. The Darkest and most exciting of the collection so far wasnt represented in the movie..the running time was TOO short and Hogwarts set was more reminiscent of Rivendell..it seemd a different place..and the layout of Hogwarts had changed (Did they think FANs wouldnt notice??!)    After watching it a second time i have a more positive view of the movie..once the inital shock of the major change in direction, portryal, scenry and acting is digested and you view it for a second time it becomes much more pleasurable and i found myself taken with the movie, laughter, anticipation  and other feelins thorugh all..Curanos touch is different but good in a sense, it is a major let down to the original movies, the feel and style is way to different yet after a second viweing i wasnt too fussed as i appreciated the rest.    I dont think Gambon did well as 'Dumbledore',Ian McKellen would have done much better.Yet the original Dumbledore was the best, really portraying him well, this loss of such a great actor was evident in the new film.     Lupin and Pettigrew wernt what i was expecting, didnt feel their acting at all, and the firebolt looked AWFUL!!!  the book    Final Thought?? Watch it twice or more an you'll enjoy it more! Try and get the first two films out of your mind and view it as its own film which is hard to do! But still a good movie but im sticking with the Book    p.s the format of the new dvd was SO dissapointing, totally put me off buying itat all, shouldv continued the original packaging!
B00006J9OT|5.0|One of music's most-gifted vocalists/pianists, the beautiful Diana Krall shows more than just her pretty face in everything she performs. Sharp delivery on the 88's, and velvet vocals, are the trademark of the Canadian-born songstress, and to hear her is to reach a higher plane in music appreciation. I have all her CD's, and each one tops the previous. She reminds you of Peggy Lee, Jeri Southern, Julie London, and others, but mostly she sounds like Diana Krall, and that's some sound. If you've heard her before, you know what I mean. If you've never heard her, welcome to the planet Earth. Buy her CD's. You'll never be sorry.
0140177396|5.0|This is a wonderful if bleak tale.  In it we meet the simple-minded giant Lennie Small and his compassionate friend George Milton and we follow their tragic tale.  It is a story of how the best-laid plans can go awry.  All they want is a piece of land that they can call home, but a double tragedy tears them apart.  It is a terribly sad, but important story that should be read.
B000059HAI|5.0|These words are spoken by Adm Yamamoto at the end of the film whne he has learned that that the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor that he planned was even more successful than they had hoped in their wildest dreams...and yet the American aircraft carriers were not there.  Thus, this film which shows the planning and execution of the attack, ends on a note of simultaneous Japanese exaltation and foreboding about the future. <br />This film is a must for anyone who cares to be an informed citizen.  It not only about the past, but also about the present (for example 9/11): what a bold thinking group of men can accomplish if they put their minds to it, the complex relations between the United States, Japan and their neighbors like China and Korea, national arrogance and overconfidence (\\"it can't happen here\\"), looking for scapegoats after a disaster, and much more. <br />From the cinematic viewpoint, the battle scenes are just breathtaking, especially the attack on Hickam Field were we see aircraft blowing up right and left and the air battles where two incredibly brave American fighter pilots take on the whole air fleet that carried out the attack returning to their aircraft carriers.  I also love the scene where we see the Japanese strike force taking off from their carriers just as dawn is breaking.  E G Marshall puts in a fine performance as Col Rufus Bratton, an American intelligence officer who is convinced that the Japanese are going to attack, as he is trying to awaken the military establishment in Washington to the danger.  Also Jason Robards does a good job as the hapless General Walter Short who is in charge of defending Hawaii from naval and air attack (Robards was actually at Pearl Harbor during the attack so I am sure he had no trouble \\"getting into\\" the part!).  Having real Japanese actors speaking Japanese (unlike the movie \\"Midway\\") gives the film a real feel of authenticity. <br /> <br />Having said these good things about the film, I would like to pointout a few weaknesses (1)  I can't understand why the American naval personnel are always shown wearing their white dress uniforms-it makes them look silly, (2) this film was made in 1970 when the US was bending over backwards to be nice to Japan because of the Cold War and the unpopularity of the presence of the American military bases in Japan resulting from the American war in Vietnam.  As a result, they repeated the line which was propagated at the time, saying that the Japanese intended to present a declaration of war before the attack commenced (the typists supposedly worked too slowly and so it was finally presented to Secretary of State Cordell Hull AFTER the attack).  In reality, the infamous \\"14-part message\\" Ambassadors Namura and Kurusu were supposed to deliver was NOT a declaration of war at all, but simply an announcement that the Japanese were breaking off negotiations.  Also, the film claims that Emperor Hirohito was personally opposed to going to war with the US, but being a \\"prisoner\\" of the cabinet, had no choice but to go along with them.  It is now widely believed by historians that the Emperor was, in fact, a strong supporter of Japanese aggression.  Also, there is some evidence that he was personally involved in war crimes.  However, all this was hushed up after the war in order to make the American occupation of Japan run smoothly, and this film simply continues this line. <br />One important point to keep in mind is that, although FDR did want to get the US into the war with Germany, he most certainly did NOT want to get into war with Japan if he could help it.  A war in the Pacific would only divert resources away from the European Theater of Operations, which he viewed as most important.  This conclusively disproves the conspiracy theories that claim the FDR  deliberately left Pearl Harbor undefended in order to shock the American people into going to war. <br />In spite of these criticisms, I still rate the film as 5-stars.
0451528956|5.0|Robert Louis Stevenson is a good storyteller, and this book is probably one of his most well-known.  It has been adapted into many different forms including the big screen and television.  It has mostly been adapted into movies in the horror genre, and the book is certainly leaning towards this, but it also a wonderful story of the supernatural that still manages to terrify us.  It is also a great story because of  Stevenson's psychological perceptions, and his strong concern for ethical problems that keeps cropping up throughout the book.  The book is still a valuable piece that should be read by anyone interested in great literature.
0765309408|4.0|I've been very picky about what books to pick up recently, given my lack of free reading time.  We've all read books that make us wonder what we were thinking at the time of purchase, or why someone could possibly have recommended this book to us.... <br /> <br />Scalzi did a wonderful job of setting up a believable world, with interesting characters...  it reminds me in many ways of 'Forever War' by Haldeman, or early Heinlein. <br /> <br />Sure, there are some parts of the book that felt like they dragged-- but for pete's sake, considering this is his first science fiction novel in print, I'm looking forward to the planned sequel.   ( And since I know he reads the reviews:   GET BACK TO WORK.  We want, nay, we *REQUIRE* the sequel. )

B000148KK2|5.0|With fully half the tracks being co-authored with hubby Elvis Costello, Ms. Krall steps beyond her rep as a crossover, pop-jazz cover queen.  Costello's lyrics lope through the darker side of relationships, particularly on the title track.  And Krall delivers with a mesmerizing melancholy, following the story lines deep into the evening shadows.  As for the other six tracks, yes, the requisite torch standards are present - a sensual \\"Temptation,\\" a longing \\"Almost Blue\\" - but even the remaining covers suggest new directions for Krall.  She's moving toward more contemporary writers, such as Joni Mitchell (a low, slow \\"Black Crow\\"), or Chris Smithers / Bonnie Raitt (a lusty \\"Love Me like a Man\\" that leaves no doubt as to Krall's intentions).  Get to know The Girl in the Other Room; you'll wonder why you didn't do so sooner.

B000000H3Z|5.0|Sepultura, NOW, is seen as such: \\"Oh yea that horrible mallcore band with the black singer!\\" Yea I know thats horrible, but its the opinion Ive gathered lately. Rarely do the younguns think of classics like this and Schizophrenia which is what they should be. This is pretty much where Sepultura hit there peak. And it all went downhill from here. Arise was a hardly noticable dip, then a plunge from there on out. Its pretty hard to fully describe this album but if I could it would be Progressive-Death-Thrash metal. ...or something like that. <br /> <br />Sepultura is pretty underrated as musicians. (as clearly noted by other reviewers) I know Kisser doesnt have the most virtuoso solos on the planet but I mean come on him and Max were just pouring with riffs by this point. The whole CD is one big rythem guitar solo with riffs in songs like Beneath the Remains, Stronger than Hate, Lobotomy, and so on. Not to mention the percussion on this is spectacular. Its not as interesting as in later releases but there isnt much room for that crap in gut busting thrash metal. Bass... nonexistant as typical. <br /> <br />The run through of the CD is an experiance in itself. It starts with the interesting 'metallica copycat' intro that leads into Part 1 of an unstopable One-Two punch. Then a pretty underrated song Stronger Than Hate. 0:38 into the song is the coolest section of the whole CD. Its full of time changes, like the whole album is, and ends with an awesome outro. I cant figure if thats bass or guitar. Then a bit of dissonance with Mass Hypnosis smacks your face with another thrash monster. Then we have a short drum breather that lasts all of 20 seconds. Then your in for a ride. 4 amazing songs right after the other with an ending Primitive Future. The bonus tracks are nothing special. <br /> <br />So left breathless after the album I cant do anything more but to go back and bang my head through it again and again. Best tracks on the album are: Beneath the Remains, Innerself, Slaves of Pain, and Lobotomy but seriously the entire album is flawless. IF I had to throw one out it would probably be Hungry just because nothing jumps and grabs my throught about it. Please do yourself a favor, pick this one up.
B00005OM4N|1.0|This is one reason why america is going down the toilet. STOP THIS INSANITY!!
B00003CY6M|5.0|Braveheart, Saving Private Ryan, Gladiator, The Last Samurai,Black Hawk Down and Glory rank as my all time favorites so you can guage where I am coming from. All these titles I own and proudly display. Behind them I keep a stack of chick flicks that no one knows I have, Serendipity is one of them. <br /> <br />When my girlfriend asked me why I purchased it I told her the truth, I have a crush on Kate Beckinsale, and like John Cusack. Later, after viewing the movie I can say it is one of the better of the genre. <br /> <br />Many may disagree. And I don't need to address the plot, as it has already been covered. More fantasy than reality. More fluff than angst. But it does have the fate-magic-destiny thing down to perfection. I rate it with Sleepless in Seattle as the best of its type.
B00005AQE8|5.0|Not get five stars by everyone.  This is one of the best albums of all time.
B000001F5F|5.0|As a genuine music connoisseur who appreciates a wide and eclectic variety of styles, I realize what makes a true album.  Two ingredients:  one, an album must genuinely reflect the best of the band at that particular time and, two, the album must be able to conjure up an emotion, if not many emotions, within the listener's soul, heart and body.   <br />With all that mumbo-jumbo out of the way, I am proud to say that U2's 1983 release \\"Live: Under A Blood Red Sky\\" meets my previous two ingredients.  With only eight songs, U2 proves that you don't need black makeup, a mosh pit and growling to produce hard rock (although I highly respect bands like Tool, Marilyn Manson, and a little bit of Slipknot).   <br />U2 have proven over the years that they can keep a solid band together.  Ever since the early '80s, when they were producing hit songs like \\"I Will Follow\\", \\"Two Hearts Beat as One\\" and \\"New Year's Day\\", they have stood the test of time amidst shallow, heartless and plastic Mickey Mouse Club set up groups like N*Sync, Britney Spears, Christina A., and other such meaningless, sappy fluff.   <br />Now, on to the album:  I give this album 5 stars because each song is diverse in its own way, while maintaining a type of chain, bringing this 35-minute lp true life.  My favorite tracks are \\"The Electric Co.\\" (killer guitar work by The Edge in the first thirty seconds), \\"Party Girl\\", \\"40\\", and especially \\"Gloria\\", UABRS's opening track.   <br />In conclusion, I must say that the best way to listen to this album is by getting it on vinyl.  Although CD's are the new wave of music, I recommend getting this one on the big black circle.  The album sleeve also makes for beautiful wall artwork, with Bono hunched over on his microphone amidst a deep, red background.   <br />
B00008J4P5|4.0|I'm one of the few people I know who can listen to The White Stripes, Gordon Lightfoot (whose song is the title of this review) and Thelonious Monk back to back. The other is my girlfriend's 5-year old son. When he first heard 'Elephant' he was very excited to tell his Mommy, \\"You have to hear this Mommy, it's so so good. The drums are really loud. It's so so good.\\" Now, if an album can pass muster with a 5-year old who loves and wants to grow up to be Gordon Lightfoot, it can't be that bad, can it? <br /> <br />Well 'Elephant' isn't bad at all. In fact, it's quite special. Jack White and Meg White are that rare talent that only come along every so often and can only have been born under just the right conditions. Songs like, 'Seven Nation Army', 'There's No Home For You Here', 'I Want To Be the Boy To Warm Your Mother's Heart' are just brilliant and beg to be listened to repeatedly.  <br /> <br />The album starts out strong with 3 powerful and unique numbers (while still borrowing heavily from Zeppelin and Hendrix and Queen) and then lapses into 3 heartfelt ballads. 'Ball and Biscuit' provides a nasty, bluesy segue into some harder rocking numbers that fill out the rest of the album. \\"It's True That We Love One Another\\" is a funny, wry country song with a vocal trio that ends the album on an upbeat note and leaves you smiling. It is very likely that you will go back and start listening to 'Seven Nation Army' immediately. The album just makes you feel good. <br /> <br />'Elephant' is not a masterpiece. It is a solid rock and roll album and stands up to comparison with the best, today, yesterday and tomorrow. It is comparable to Led Zeppelin's II (as opposed to IV) or Jimi Hendrix's Electric Ladyland (as opposed to Are You Experienced?). A great album, but not the crown jewel.
B00012FXAE|4.0|While this sequel film was almost perfectly done it lacks just one thing: the solid storyline feeling movies made before 1985 used to have. The 1970's first Alien movie had a more solid storyline feeling. I also felt this film had no right borrowing elements from the adrenaline-charging but limbbrained Rambo film series.

B00003CXA6|4.0|Gettysburg is an excellent movie revolving around the Civil War battle of Gettysburg.  I felt this movie was unique in the fact it showed the strategy and the logistics of the battle rather than showing the blood, horror, and dismemberment that I would expect from a movie based on the bloodiest battle of the civil war.  The movie starts on June 30, 1863, the day before the battle at Gettysburg begins.  The movie mainly revolves around the involvement of two groups, the 20th Maine Regiment (commanded by Col. Chamberlain played by Jeff Daniels) and the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia (commanded by Gen. Lee played by Martin Sheen).<br /><br />The movie does show its share of blood; however, I thought the movie did a brilliant job depicting the logistics of the battle and what happened behind the scenes of the battle.  The movie showed the people behind the war, not just the war itself.  For instance, the movie portrayed some of the reasons Gen. Lee led the Confederate Army to battle at this particular place and the reservations some of the Generals under Gen. Lee had with fighting the North at Gettysburg.  It also showed Col. Chamberlain dealing with problems unrelated to the battle, such as taking in over 100 Northern soldiers who refused to fight after their unit was disbanded.  I do not know enough about the history of the Battle of Gettysburg to say whether the contents of this movie is factual or not.<br /><br />At over 4 hours, this movie is slightly on the slow side.  If your idea of a great war movie is Hamburger Hill or Rambo, this movie is definitely not for you.  If you are interested in the people behind war and the decisions they make, this movie is definitely worth watching.

Sarah is a girl that Shelly took care of.<br />  One year later, Sarah visits the graves of Shelly and Eric.  She puts a bunch of flowers on Shelly's and a white rose on Eric's.  There is a crow sitting on Eric Draven's tombstone. (Notice Draven has &#34;raven&#34; in it).  Sarah asks the crow, &#34;What are you the night watchman?&#34;.  Indeed he is.  Later the ground is lifting above Eric's grave.  It is Eric (Brandon Lee), who looks normal, trying to get out of the ground from his coffin.  he lets out a primal scream.  It is raining hard.  He goes back to his apartment.  Everything was left as it was a year ago.  it is filthy.  Window was never boarded.  His crow flies with him everywhere he walks.  Eric's white cat, Gabriel, is still there who recognizes him.  Eric begins to have total recall of what happened to him and his fiancee in the apartment.  When Eric touches the broken window, both of his hands are cut with blood coming out.  But they heal before his eyes.  Eric has manifested.  he decides he must get revenge.  he puts on white clown make-up with black on his lips.  He will now hunt down those thugs with his guide The Crow.<br />  This film is gritty, rainy and dark.  It sets the mood real well.  Gothic!<br />  Numerous gritty, rock n' roll films have been made, but The Crow (1994) was the first of its kind.<br />  I do not like the drug use and foolish sex in this film.  But I do enjoy the long, continuous scenes as you fly like The Crow.<br />  Sadly, Brandon Lee was doing a scene (March 30, 1992) where he was continuously being shot at.  A faulty prop gun had shot him in the abdomen.  The cap of a blank had lodged into his spine after entering his abdomen.  He died the next day.  Brandon Lee's father was Bruce Lee, a martial arts expert and actor who had been in &#34;The Green Hornet&#34; tv series and made martial arts films as well.  His father had died in 1973 from a brain edema and marihuana was found in his stomach.<br />  Since Brandon Lee died, they used a stand-in and spent over $3000,000 to computerize Brandon's face on the stand-in to make new scenes to finish the film.  This technique was later perfected and became known as CGI effects in the film, TWISTER (1996).<br /><br />On this VHS, &#34;The Making of The Crow&#34; is followed after the movie.

0679759328|5.0|Anita Brookner is a writer of enormous intelligence and subtlety. She is a writer who chronicles the small motions of the heart in expectation and disappointment. She writes usually with a kind of fine irony and her characters rarely escape untouched by careful criticism. In this novel still thought to be her best Edith Hope the protagonist a romance- writer who has walked out of her own wedding and is carrying on a passionate( from her side) affair with a married man escapes to a Swiss vacation resort. There she encounters other lives caught in the desperations of love, and there too she comes to meet the one who will be something like her rescuer, the decent Neville who she will commit herself to a loveless marriage too. With Brookner the heart of the story is not in the major movements of the plot but with the line- by- line perceptions which mark out an extremely intelligent observer of the heart's minor motions. Disappointment and learning to live with a life far less than one has hoped are major Brookner themes. She gives the reader that consolation of knowing that a certain kind of quiet suffering is not theirs alone.<br /><br />I myself have found that reading a few Brookner novels has been enough, but I know one faithful reader of Brookner who continues to see her as the best diagnostician of the ailing human heart writing novels today.

I promise you, you will not be let down. I have given this as a gift several times w/out knowing what kind of story someone liked to read and every time it gets rave reviews. The bets gift you can give someone who likes to read is the gift of a realy good story.And just for the record I am so not a science fiction/fantasy fan. This story is just so good!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0553208845|3.0|This is a beautiful novel. The story of a spiritual quest in which the young privileged hero goes out to the world , and tries to meet and know every different kind of experience. He goes through different stages of life , including one in which he tastes the sensual pleasures of life to the full. He meets old age, sickness and death. He comes to a kind of humble understanding of the nature of life and his spiritual quest is one in which he comes to a kind of peace.<br /><br />The story is told with simplicity and skill, and it flows wonderfully.<br /><br />My own problem with the book is that the wretch ' concentred all in self' . There is no deeper understanding of how the ordinary connections of family and community , and the giving to them provide life with meaning and dimension beyond the self. There is too no feeling that one can by one's own effort add to the goodness of the world, make a change for the better however small.<br /><br />This is not to deny the truth of Siddartha's quest or understanding, but only to indicate that it is one road and not the only road or in my opinion the ideal road the person can take in this life.
B00030590I|5.0|I don't know where to begin with Hero, in all honesty.  When I walked into the theatre to see Hero, I was thinking two things:  1) This movie is going to be awesome, and 2) I hope it shows some sort of individuality (critics said it was too similar to Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon).  Hero delivered on both of those notes.  I can't stress enough that the point of the movie is not to show people flying around and shielding arrows with silk dresses, that is just part of the overall effect.  The point of the movie is 'visual poetry'.  If you could imagine watching your favorite poem, it would be in the form of Hero. <br /> <br />Beside that, the movie itself is absolutely amazing.  The fight scenes will leave you breathless.  There is not a moment when you will ask yourself \\"Why did the director do that?\\"  Some memorable fight scenes are:  'The Fabricated Showdown' between Nameless and Sky, 'Falling Leaves' between Snow and Moon, 'Green Sheets' between Broken Sword and the King, 'Walking on Water' between Nameless and Broken Sword, and 'Library Encounter' between Nameless and Snow against Broken Sword and Moon.  Each of these scenes encorporates a different color into it to show the emotions in the fighters.  For example, 'Green Sheets' is represented by green, displaying the greed and selfishness of Broken Sword.  'Falling Leaves' is represented by orange for rage, followed by the transition to red, representing the lust and love both women had for Broken Sword. <br /> <br />The plot is very simple yet very powerful:  a Qin warrior who goes by Nameless has recently killed the three most feared assassins in all of China:  Sky, Broken Sword, and Snow.  As a reward, the King invites Nameless to drink within ten feet of him, the closest anyone has been allowed to come within the king since the assassination attempt on him three years before.  While Nameless recalls the story of how he was able to kill the three assassins as so many tried to do previously, the king deviseshis own theory as to what really happened.  When the truth comes out, it seems as if nobody is safe, not even those who have died. <br /> <br />Hero is an action packed thrill ride, but ultimately it recalls the unbreakable love between man and country.  Through tragedies and thriumphs, intimacy and heartbreak, the love from each of the characters can be seen to that of \\"Our Land\\".

I am proud that we are here in Iraq helping to bringing that same freedom to those who have been oppressed for years.

In this movie, however, the racism is portrayed as a \\"gentle\\" sort of racism where half caste girls are being isolated and educated for their own good, noblesse oblige at its finest (or at its worst).  One striking point in the movie was when the administrator shows a number of slides where aborigines become more and more white, as succeeding generations intermarry more and more with whites.    This was a very painful movie to watch.  I could imagine the three girls wondering what they did wrong to be taken from their homes and from their parents to what could only seem to them to be a prison.  The arrogance of the administrator was very difficult to watch also.  He seemed to believe the clichs that he was tossing about regarding the simplicity of these people, and their need to come under the white man's beneficence.  But in today's world he appears more like a slavemaster.    The aborigines are portrayed as slaves.  The tracker was obliged to stay at the camp or lose his daughter.  Girls were not allowed to speak when they ate, and would be placed alone in an exposed box for the least infraction, reminiscent of the torture box in Bridge on the River Kwai.    There is nothing uplifting in this movie, except for the determination of the girls to set a goal and follow it.  But in the end, their efforts were illusory. Don't expect any good or warm fuzzy feelings from this.  Instead, be prepared for a couple of hours of a very, very difficult and painful experience.

B0002Z0EYK|3.0|The main thing this film has in its favor is the beautiful country it was shot in. The landscapes and backdrops are jaw-droppingly beautiful. That said, lets focus on the movie itself. Wolfgang Peterson took many, many departures from the legend of Troy in this film, and gave a timeless story from the ages a well-worn soap-opera feel. The action sequences were obviously well-planned and are truthfully quite spectacular. If only everyone hadn't seen the Lord of the Rings films, with their very superior army clash sequences. It was as if the fights had been seen before, although the Achilles fights were notable highlights. I bring special notice to Peter O'Toole here, for he brought a special dignity and grace to King Priam, and Eric Bana does a fine job as Hector. Brad Pitt was noticeably very buff in the role of Achilles, although he seemed a bit too much on the pouty side for a great warrior of the ages. Diane Kruger as Helen may have been a bit in over her head here. She honestly didn't have much to do here, except appear here and there in the story. Overall, the film drags a bit, the actors seem bored with the whole thing at times, but it just does work. The DVD transfer was very good, with rich contrast and great sound quality.
B00003CXAA|5.0|My first intro to GF 1 and 2 was in the 80's on LP size Laser Disc format.  After a long wait, I bought this DVD as soon as it was launched in late 03 and still watching it from time to time since...... and I have to keep on reminding myself that it is not a true story....
B0000BWVCM|4.0|I have always enjoyed the X-Men comics, and the two feature films have done a fine job of following the spirit of the comics, if not the exact detail of the charactors and their stories. X2 is certainly one of the best comic adaptations ever put to film, due to the seriousness the actors and director obviously put into it. If they played it tongue-in-cheek, it would have been a disastor. All the roles are intelligently realized here, only a couple of beefs, though. The relationship between Rogue and Wolverine, so touching in the first film, is much more distant here. And what happened to Storm and Rogue's accents here? Storm being from Africa, and Rogue from Louisiana, each had noticeable accents in the first film, yet neither had them here. Oh well. Brian Cox as the bad guy was very good. One thing, I do wish his link to Wolverine was explained a bit better. Overall, the film moves well, grags little, and has action sequences that are well-done, with great effects. The ending leaves me more than ready for X3. I can't wait! Anyway, enjoy this film, because most comic-book movies aren't this well-done (remember the later Batman movies?).
B00005JMAH|3.0|This movie is my least favorite of all three, which is saying something since Azkaban is my favorite of the five books. There are major parts in the books that are missing, and random parts in the movie that are not in the books. Dumbledore is all right, but I liked Richard Harris better. I also prefer the music in this one. I'm giving it three stars because it is a good movie, if you haven't read the books, but have been watching the movies, then you wouldn't notice things that aren't in the book, or missing parts. Hopefully Goblet of Fire will be better. Also, they changed the DVD case, and now it doesn't have a slipcover, which I liked better. The acting is still just as good as it was in the Chamber of Secrets. The major dissapointment in this movie is the scenes they added / removed. See the previous review, with the list of all the things wrong, I have no need to repeat them.
B000002N1E|5.0|I stumbled across this out of print album and fortunately bought it at a reasonable price AND in perfect condition...just a terrific album...an undervalued gem...the other reviewers have already extolled its virtues so I'll just say that I HIGHLY recommend seeking it out and buying it. Enjoy!
B00005JNEI|5.0|It is fitting that this DVD becomes available as the Bush administration abandons its costly, in blood and money, search for Iraqi WMDs.  Extra material makes this DVD worthwhile even if you have seen the movie, something most of the one star reviewers can't claim.
B00009V7P8|5.0|This album is amazing....it literally takes my breath away to listen to some of this songs. In a world of cookie-cutter musicians, and endlessly repetitive radio stations, this CD is a breath of fresh air. Everything about this album is masterfully put together...the gorgeous instrumentals, stark vocals--even the order of songs, beginning with slow and bittersweet and progressing to heart-wrenchingly desperate is genius. The highlights of this album for me are by far \\"Delicate\\", \\"The Blower's Daughter\\", \\"Amie\\", \\"I Remember\\" and \\"Eskimo\\", however, every song is worth several listens.
B00005JMXX|3.0|A film by Roland Emmerich<br /><br />Yes, \\"The Day After Tomorrow\\" is the latest in a long tradition of disaster movies and it managed to spawn the rather dreadful television movie \\"Category Six\\".  The premise here is that after decades (centuries, even) of devastating the environment through industry the world is facing a climate shift.  Jack Hall (Dennis Quaid) is a scientist who has been warning anyone who will listen that we have to start thinking about the future right now and not leave the Earth a worse mess for future generations to deal with after it is too late.  Hall believes that similar, severe climate shifts have happened several times throughout the history of this planet.  In Jack's prediction, however, he admits that this may be decades if not centuries away.  For there to be any sort of a movie, however, we know that this drastic climate shift is about to happen in the immediate future.<br /><br />Jack Hall is dismissed by the Dick Cheney look-a-like Vice President, but from the beginning of the movie we have been seeing some strange weather.  The air temperature dropped so quickly over Scotland that helicopters little froze in midair and dropped.  The pilots also physically froze in place.  Maybe cryogenics will be able to help them out in the future.  Likewise, there are reports of bizarre weather all over the planet and it is becoming apparent that something is very wrong.  Not too far into the movie government officials start believing Jack and have Jack and his staff work out a forecast model for what this storm is going to do.  The only potential forecast that Jack has is what he believes happened tens of thousands of years ago.  With this forecast he sees that the climate shift is going to be harsher and quicker than anyone would imagine possible.<br /><br />\\"The Day After Tomorrow\\" is not just about death and destruction and pretty special effects, but there is a side-story revolving around his son, Sam (Jake Gyllenhaal).  Sam is a high school student and is incredibly bright.  He is in New York City for some sort of a Quiz Bowl Championship.  On his team is a girl he is very interested in named Laura (Emmy Rossum), but he is too shy/scared to talk about his feelings for her.  When the climate shift occurs, they are trapped in New York after the city floods, then freezes.  From talking to his father, Sam knows that the deep freeze which knocked out the helicopters is headed for New York and anyone caught outside will not survive it.<br /><br />As good of a job as Emmy Rossum did in \\"The Phantom of the Opera\\" she is given nothing to do here other than be the love interest of Sam, and this entire subplot is unnecessary.  Honestly, most viewers know that these disaster movies are never very good, but we watch them to see wanton destruction and some special effects.  Surprisingly, the discussion about what is going on with the weather is actually interesting and is one of the better parts about the movie.  I think it is because the characters are taking the issue seriously and there is nothing campy or horribly unrealistic about it.  If the absurd is taken seriously, the absurd becomes believable.  But even that pales in the absurdity of Jack trying to travel from Washington D.C. to New York City to rescue Sam after the Climate Shift and before the Hard Freeze.  That part is just too absurd for words.<br /><br />Dennis Quaid is a very good actor and his work puts this whole discussion into the realm of the believability, and I have been enjoying his recent work since \\"The Rookie\\".  Gyllenhaal is a bit old for his role here, but he is fine as is Rossum who has nothing to do.  The reason we watch this movie, however, is the destruction.  It looks good (well, as good as the destruction of our planet can look).  The trouble is just that all of the climate stuff is done in the first half of the movie, so that the rest of it is just anti-climactic.<br /><br />A movie like \\"The Day After Tomorrow\\" makes me wonderwhat happens after the movie ends.  What happens to all these people now that the climate has stabilized?  Is there is a shift in ecological responsibility?  Will there be new world powers since half of America (and Europe) is under ice?  Of course, the movie doesn't answer the questions, but it is something to think about after the movie is over.  The reason I think about the questions is also because the movie itself wasn't that good.  It isn't supposed to be, or, at least I don't think it is supposed to be good.  It is a special effects bonanza in the tradition of disaster movies.  In that sense, it is no worse than anything that has come before and it looks better (though \\"Deep Impact\\" is still far superior to any recent disaster movie).  If you like disaster movies (despite their lack of narrative or performance quality), then this should be entertaining.  If you want an Oscar Caliber film, then look elsewhere.  Grade: C-.<br /><br />-Joe Sherryorrow\\" makes me wonder what happens after the movie ends.  What happens to all these people now that the climate has stabilized?

B0001Z52RU|1.0|Okay everyone, get ready for a really crapily written reveiw that does a bad job of convinsing you how terrible this movie is. That said, let me begin... I just watched this movie and it is the dumestest dumest dum movie I have seen in a very long time. The movie is especially terrible because it trys to pawn itself off as a good film. Do not be fooled by this cra*- actually, I take that back. If you are fooled by it, you just aren't a good enough person to deserve to recognize its obvious patheticness. The movie is full of flaws- and the terrible thing is that I can appreciate a film with flaws, even many! But these flaws are at the heart of this picture. This movie review doesn't diserve a spell check. Peace, C
6305278016|4.0|'Black Rain' came out in 1989.  It's shown a lot of legs (it was on HBO last weekend) for two reasons:  first and foremost, it's a Ridley Scott film, nuff said; second, it is - as the amazon reviewer pointed out - a wonderfully guilty pleasure, featuring such delightful absurdities as Kate Capeshaw (Mrs. Steven Spielberg, for god's sake) crammed into some va-va-voom sequined outfit, and sportin' some seriously tousled Big 80s hair.  And speaking of big hair, that's one excellent mullet being chaperoned around by Michael Douglas.  It is, after all, 1989.<br /><br />I'll put this film in the same category as Philip Kaufman's 'Rising Sun' - 1989 was the height (of absurdity, as it turns out) of the Japanese bubble economy, and Japan-focused films of this age spoke to the fear or at least latent concern about the Japanese economic model eventually besting the US model.  So, in light of a dramatically different Japan circa 2005, 'Black Rain' looks a little over the top.  But, hey, this is a movie, and this is Ridely Scott.  You want subtlety?  Look elsewhere.<br /><br />The real star of the film (if you can look around Mr. Douglas' most excellent rants and rages) is regal Japanese star Ken Takakura as Detective Masahiro.  His IMDB filmography lists 130 substantial roles in his prolific history and calls him \\"the Clint Eastwood of Japan,\\" not faint praise in anyone's book.  Mr. Takahura literally holds the film together, acting as the bridge between the Douglas/Garcia side of the film, and the Japanese side of the film.  It's great work.
B0002X314C|5.0|This CD is great from beginning to end.  True, the lyrics on some of the tracks don't go too deep but it's definitely a must have if you can appreciate a one of a kind voice and great producing.  It's not too often that I can listen to a CD all the way through and love it.  A Must Have!!!
B000069AUI|5.0|I, like the previous reviewer was not overly impressed with this album on the first listen. However, this album like all great music just grows and grows on you. Of course, most are familiar with \\"Clocks\\", as the single it stands out but there are really no weak links to this chain. Personal favorites would have to be \\"The Scientist\\" and \\"Politik\\" but each track has it's own merits. Hard to top \\"Parachutes\\", but in my opinion this one shows exceptional growth. <br />Contrary to an early critical opinion of these guys, they are no Radiohead clone. They can definitely stand on their own.
B000063DI8|4.0|I gave this album a horrible review, but then I read some positive takes on the album which made me look at it from a different perspective.  Not their best work, but one can appreciate the tongue-in-cheek music balanced with serious music.  Janick is still a good guitarist, much better than a lot of bands today.  This album goes back to the old days.  I ignore my old review.
B00005JNBQ|4.0|First of all, you have to be in the right mood to watch Napoleon Dynamite. Once you're in this mood, watching Napoleon can be fun enjoyable, and full of laughs. From the start this movie exudes the kind of quirky and off-beat humor that makes you despise and fall in love with the characters at the same time. Their simple misadventures, in a way, make you appreciate your own life. When I first saw this movie on DVD, I turned it off after 45 minutes because it just seemed so stupid and lame. Then I realized though what this movie had to offer and I was able to find the humor in some of the parts of the movie and then I turned it back on and continued watching. This movie has a lot of \\"1-liners\\", which you will find yourself and others who have seen this movie repeating for weeks. I recommend this movie because it makes you laugh in a different kind of way. This plot-less comedy, while boring at first, will entertain you more than a lion and a tiger put together.

But the night is still not over because Martha has invited a young couple, Nick (George Segal) and Honey (Sandy Dennis) for a little party.

Elizabeth Taylor, Richard Burton, George Segal and Sandy Dennis bring life and reality to their roles. <br />The dialogues are sharp, biting and cruel, but nevertheless sometimes also funny because of the unusual way Martha and George talk to each other.The music perfeclty expresses the depressing atmosphere of the movie. <br /> <br />\\"Who's afraid of Virginia Woolf?\\" is not a funny, nice and simple movie, but nevertheless very fascinating and worth watching.

0064407667|1.0|I'm another reader looking at other authors while waiting for the next Harry Potter books.  I wondered if this was a children's books or adult mainstream book several times as I read through it.  The author uses an odd technique for teaching vocabulary every few pages with a phrase \\"[word], which means...\\" where the definition does not often match the word and could be confusing - it seems to be a poor writing technique instead of a useful teaching method.  The adult tones of molotov cocktail recipes, sickening innuendos, and the bleak outlook are not handled well.  If the book was targeted for adults, the consistently negative stereotyping of theater types, legal professionals, and bankers would be laughable - characters are one-sided and nobody seems to have depth.  Also, Violet is not \\"inventing\\" if she is building a tool already well known; she is improvising.  On a positive note, the characters all have a love of reading and comment frequently on the power of knowledge.  The book would benefit from some editing and structural changes.

1400032717|5.0|I almost didn't buy this book, because a number of customer reviews said the book was not worth reading.  I'm glad my curiosity got the best of me!  This is one of the most creative novels I have read in a very long time.  It is an easy, but deep read.  The character of Christopher, like the book itself, works on several levels.  I found myself identifying and agreeing with Christopher and caught up in the secrets he uncovers.  Every chapter brings new insights to the story and the world we live in.  I strongly recommend this book, and I suggest to customers who didn't like this book that they try again and look for the hidden insights and meanings.
B000687M48|3.0|This CD/DVD package is a recording of Evanescence's live performance in Paris during their 2004 world tour. Let me start off by saying I love the band's major-label debut, \\"Fallen\\", but this is really for the die-hard Evanescence fans. I did enjoy this package very much, but there were a few things that disappointed me. Here's the rundown...<br /><br />CD: The band sounded excellent when I saw them in concert during the U.S. leg of this tour. Although they perform well, I don't think they sound as good live as they do on the album, unless you're actually at the concert. Don't get me wrong, the band is VERY talented and Amy Lee is an amazing vocalist, but there are several times during the show when she is struggling to hit notes. I don't think she used \\"studio-magic\\" when making \\"Fallen\\" because during the back-stage segement of the DVD, she is singing beautifully. I just think that when she runs around on stage and gets out of breath, it gets hard for her to sing as well. As for the band, they sound fine, with the exception of the guitarist still trying to keep up with the solo's Ben Moody wrote before leaving the group. Ben was an amazing guitar player...the other guys are good to but during \\"Going Under\\" the solo is a little loose and is only about a quarter of the length as it is on the album. Aside from those things, the disc is really good. The guitars and drums sound very heavy, especially on the opening song \\"Haunted\\". For this show, the band performed 10 out of the 11 songs from their \\"Fallen\\" album, as well as 2 b-sides (\\"Farther Away\\" and \\"Breathe No More\\") and even a beautiful cover of Korn's \\"Thoughtless\\". I think these songs alone are worth buying this package for. Finally, the CD ends with a previously unreleased studio track called \\"Missing\\". It's a very nice song but I wouldn't say it's one of their best ever. Pretty good overall.<br /><br />DVD: This is the same performance as the one on the CD. Rather than just filming the concert with multiple cameras, lots of effects (such as slow-motion, repeating frames, blurred images) were added to make the performance more dramatic. This could be good or bad, depending on your outlook. I think it's good because it makes the performance more interesting to watch...but it could also be bad because it feels like your watching more of a music video rather than a concert. The backstage footage is pretty interesting, there's no interviews, it's just the band goofing off left and right, but it's pretty funny. You'll see brief cameos from the guys in Seether, Breaking Benjamin and Three Days Grace. Also included on this disc are the band's 4 music videos: \\"Bring Me To Life\\" / \\"Going Under\\" / \\"My Immortal\\" / \\"Everybody's Fool\\". The videos are good and it's nice to be able to watch them whenever I want.e cameras, lots of effects (such as slow-motion, repeating frames, blurred images) were added to make the performance more dramatic.

B000002UAU|3.0|I can't believe Capitol dug this one out of the vaults for re-release!  Bands like this are supposed to sink into oblivion!  Seargant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band's album \\"The Beatles\\" is worth a listen for collectors of obscure & underground 60s music. <br /> <br />Seargant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band was a short-lived group of comedians and experimental musicians from Chicago who centered this, their only album, on the comic concept of a supergroup called \\"The Beatles.\\" <br /> <br />The only shades of this album that can be found elsewhere in music would be in The Residents' \\"Meet The Residents\\" album. And I suspect this one may have been an early influence on that group. <br /> <br />\\"The Beatles\\" is a song cylce intended to parody the overblown pretensiousness of the teen-idol craze, showing us what happens to bigheaded young men when they actually believe the hype surrounding them.  And so, Seargant Pepper imagines them taking nonsensical topics such as a circus run by \\"Mr. Kite,\\" or condescending to date a pretty meter maid called \\"Lovely Rita\\" with her close-minded sisters, sitting on their petty sofa (How cute! They sit on sofas just like us!).  \\"The Beatles\\" spin theirselves into so much self-absorption they usually take plebian yet catchy melodies that could have come from a television musical at the time (\\"When I'm Sixty Four,\\" \\"With a Little Help From My Friends,\\" \\"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds,\\") and then go over them with layers of sound-effects and studio trickery and consider it art.  Hilarious are songs like \\"Getting Better\\" and \\"Good Morning\\" in which the lyrical content is so laughably pointless, but wrapped in symphonics so sweet yet so simplistic it's a little creepy.  At the end of the song, you feel that you've just woken up after a night in which you've been slipped a date-rape drug!  Here, Seargant Pepper presents us with a serious statement on the dangers of pop-culture. <br /> <br />If you pay attention to the narrative of Seargant Pepper's album, you get the sense that this make-believe band, \\"The Beatles,\\" started out no differently than any other garage-group... young and not exceptionally talented nor exceptionally original, but charismatic and willing to exploit the market for popularity.  Sadly, self-conscious of their short-comings, they begin shrouding their typical-sounding songs in religious mystique and overdoing the production in order to veil their lack of substantial ideas.  It is a heartbreaking story of what can happen to a young band who get trapped by fame before they are mature enough or artistically capable enough to handle it. <br /> <br />Seargant Pepper has thought through all the fine points; we see self-doubt and longing for something more substantial in meditative tracks like \\"Within You Without You\\" (a side-thought \\"composed\\" by one of The Beatles' backing musicians) and \\"A Day in the Life,\\" in which one co-leader of the band (\\"John\\") is actually interupted in the middle of developing a deep thought by another co-leader (\\"Paul\\") halfway through the song in order to dumb it down for audiences (\\"Woke up/Grabbed my hat/a-doodley-doo/in seconds flat...\\" he rambles desperately, pointlessly)!  One wonders if \\"The Beatles\\" could have managed sustaining such success had they been real! <br /> <br />While \\"The Beatles\\" is not an easy listen by any means (Seargant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band were so anti-commercial listening can be a painful experience) and you certainly won't be hearing these tracks on your oldies radio station any time soon, this album is moreover worth the listen if you can find it cheap.
B000056N8X|5.0|This is the best possibly the best of the Highlander series through performances and fight choreography. Adrian Paul and Christopher Lambert put on there very best performoances of there careers. The two act off each other in this very underated cult favorite series. I'm glad that Highlander is more of a cult followed series because if it were overrated i believe people would put the movie's down even more. And i will also say respect Highlander 2 for being different think of it as the title says a Renagade Version
6304493681|5.0|After watcheing the second movie, I still think this is the better one. Feels like there will be at least another one out, maybe the second movie suffer the middle child syndrome. This is definately the one that will blow you away, sort like the first time you see Matrix. Superb sound track, and editing.
B000003GMI|4.0|Seems that ANYONE who enjoys the Pink Floyd - 'Ummagumma' 2-CD classic is more or less guaranteed to dig this disc, or for that matter a good most of ALL Porcupine Tree releases. 'The Sky Moves Forward' was originally put out in 1995, as it was the group's second piece of work to rattle our brains. The line-up here, which is Steve Wilson - guitar & vocals, Colin Edwin - bass, Richard Barbieri - keyboards and Chris Maitland - drums appears to be a long-lasting one, because I believe this very line-up remains intact even today. 'Sky' is not so much as space rock, like some may assume (including myself at first), but more like 'progressive art rock'. The tracks here I was sort of blown away with were the two (2) title cuts, \\"The Sky Moves Sideways - Phase One\\" (18:43) and \\"The Sky Moves Sideways - Phase Two\\" (16:46). Plus, I also liked \\"Moonloop\\", of which also shows up on their live 'Coma Divine' CD (see my review). Well worth checking out.
B000000W5L|5.0|What can one say ?  'Exile on Main Street' is easily one of the Stones' greatest albums.  It's a bluesy, raunchy, soulful, erotic, grinding, swaying, moaning ode to the qualities and musical styles of the best rock music --- rhythm, blues, country, soul and gospel.  The album does indeed sound like a late night jam session that recalls nothing so much as those that be-bop jazz musicians used to have in the late '40's and 1950's  --- fueled by whisky, cigarettes, pot, heroin, but most of all fueled by an absolute love and dedication to the music being made.  Mick Jagger's voice, while more indescipherable than ever, has never sounded more passionate or committed : check out \\"Let It Loose\\", possibly his greatest-ever vocal moment with the Stones.  And throughout the record, Keith Richards and the much-missed Mick Taylor bounce riffs and rhythmic ideas off of each other like two brothers who have been working together for ages.  The lyrics seem to be focused throughout on the usage of sex for power and manipulation (\\"Rocks Off\\", \\"Loving Cup\\", \\"Turd on the Run\\", \\"Let It Loose\\" and the album's fiery closer \\"Soul Survivor\\" are all prime examples), but the music shows a band in fighting trim and more determined than ever to survive past their 30's --- which, of course, the Stones did (sometimes admirably, but more often not).  What they achieved here is certainly one of the best studio double albums in rock 'n roll history, just behind Dylan's 'Blonde on Blonde' and Derek and the Dominos' 'Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs'.<br /><br />The Stones still had one great ('Some Girls') and one very good ('Tattoo You') studio album left in them, but 'Exile on Main Street' is truly where they shot their load for rock immortality once and for all.  The listening experience is nothing less than enthralling.
B00030590I|5.0|I jumped on the bandwagon late for martial arts films.  \\"Crouching Tiger...\\" was pretty much my only exposure to this genre of film but it kick started an extreme interest and appreciation for the art.  \\"Hero\\" is fantastic, I've only seen the first half, I'm looking forward to seeing the rest since I finally bought it on DVD. I am also eagerly awaiting the release of \\"House of Flying Daggers\\".
B000002UAO|5.0|'Rubber Soul', 'Revolver' and 'Sgt. Pepper' -- these are the Beatles' big three ('Abbey Road' is wonderful but flawed). This album features what arguably ranks as the best overall work on a Beatles album from John Lennon. \\"Norwegian Wood\\", \\"Nowhere Man\\", \\"Girl\\" and \\"In My Life\\" are some of the finest compositions that he ever offered to the group.  If you could take John Lennon's work from 'Rubber Soul' and combine it with Paul McCartney's work on 'Revolver' onto one album, you would easily have the greatest album ever made.  The lyrics to the songs on 'Rubber Soul', as it stands, are some of the most introspective and deeply moving that the group members ever came up with.    The album was made during a time when the Beatles were still united as a performing unit, maturing in their abilities but still tied to the group as a whole and not pursuing their own individual interests and avenues.  They were still THE Beatles --- touring, performing, recording, hugely influential and the best damn rock 'n roll band on the planet. They were also incorporating folk-rock and Dylan-inspired influence into their music , which of course lead 'Rubber Soul' to inspire the Beach Boys' masterpiece 'Pet Sounds'.  This album, in terms of the quality of its individual songs, has to be recognized as one of the band's greatest achievements.
B0002KVUKM|4.0|Usually I avoid any movie that promotes itself on Happy Meal boxes or Taco Bell cups, but \\"Van Helsing\\" surprised me.  Alot of action, interesting story and awesome special effects and make-up. I guess some people would rather watch a film like \\"The Village\\" (which is the equivilent to watching a hampster spin around on a wheel for 2 hours).  If you like being entertained with no strings attached, \\"Van Helsing\\" delivers.  Every movie ever made doesn't have to be profound.  Film snobs will hate \\"Van Helsing\\" and scoff because it lacks such things as \\"irony\\" and \\"character development\\".  Those topics are passe and trife and cleary used a bargaining tools for the jaded film slave desperate for validation.  \\"Van Helsing\\" is an excellent film for what genre it was made for.  Horror/Thriller/Drama/Action.  It fills all of those shoes.
B0001ZMWQO|5.0|The only album i have listened to so far where i have liked EVERY SINGLE song :) <br /> <br />Franz Ferdinand hit a winner with their self titled album, which is a perfect example of what this fantastic band is all about.  <br /> <br />Along with some excellent guitar work and awesome bass, Franz have an overall lighthearted approach to rock. Most of their tracks are, in fact, slightly danceable, making it all the more pleasant to listen to on a boring busride or just when you need an uplifting bout of damn good rock.  <br /> <br />In my opinion, Franz Ferdinand have a similar style to that of Interpol, unique lead vocals and an \\"almost pop-rock but too cool for that\\" sound.  <br /> <br />In this album you will find unbeatably good rythm in every single track, GUARANTEED, extremely listener friendly music, and altogether something that will make you want to bop around, wherever you are (which may have some undesired effects depending on where it is you are :p) If you've heard their single \\"Take Me Out\\" and liked it, you won't be disiappointed, in fact, you'll be delighted, because the entire album has a similar mood and sound.  <br /> <br />Good songs include: Take Me Out (of course!), Tell Her Tonight, The Dark Of The Matinee, This Fire, Michael, 40', Jaqueline...oops, that's pretty much the whole album, isn't it? :) <br /> <br />Seriously a TOP NOTCH album, it wasn't voted Album of the Year on Triple J down here for nothing!!!
0316666343|4.0|\\"My name was Salmon, like the fish; first name Suzie. I was fourteen when I was murdered on December 6, 1973.\\" Young Suzie Salmon was raped and killed in the early 70's. Now she watches her family, her friends, and her murderer continue on with life as she watches on from Heaven.  She sees her sister, her brother, and parents cope with her absence as she watches her murderer as he plots out his next victim. The only thing Suzie ever wonders is: Will he ever get caught? <br /> Alice Sebold writes this story from a first person perspective. Sebold makes it seem like the whole story is coming from a fourteen year old girl, and not an adult. Although it is based on tragedy, it is also quite humorous. Suzie's witty attitude makes this book worth while. It also seems to catch the stress and excitement of teenage years when you read Suzie's flashbacks and her sisters life when Suzie observes her. <br /> This book is not perfect, it does have flaws. The book loses some momentum at the end of the story and there are some strange and random subjects thrown into the story. The book has flashbacks and it is sometimes hard to tell whether you are reading about Suzie's past, or what she is seeing in Heaven. Page 127 is an example of this when it skips from her fathers thoughts to her murderer's house.  <br /> Overall, this is a suspenseful and spell-binding book. You will not want to set The Lovely Bones down when you begin to read it. Anyone should definitely take their time to read this humorous and refreshingly witty novel. Alice Sebold's The Lovely Bones will have you on the edge of your seat. <br />
B00005B4GU|3.0|If you're looking for conventional and mainstream from Radiohead, you should pack up and leave.  <br /> <br />Radiohead is beautiful. It's like...cool oprah. Spectacular to listen to, every song is it's own brooding masterpiece, and the true eccentricity of Radiohead art is demonstrated in this album. <br /> <br />It is, however, an aquired taste, and needs a couple of spins before it can be fully appreciated for what it is. Listen to if <br />a) Your love life is like a sad and tragic movie <br />b) Your uphill struggle is getting you down and you say \\"meh, i might as well go the whole sorry mile\\" <br />c) If you can appreciate the strange beauty of Radiohead. <br /> <br />Newer listeners might like to try a different album, however, this is packed full of mini- masterpieces...listen to the entire length of every song for maximum enjoyment :) <br /> <br />Some beauties include : Pyramid song, Spinning Plates, I Could Be Wrong. <br /> <br />
0743424425|3.0|When I was four years old, I saw Stanley Kubrick's version of \\"The Shining\\" on television.  That movie haunted me, and I was terrified of the dead woman that attacked Danny in the bathroom for years. I saw the movie again 14 years later, and still felt it was the scariest thing I had ever seen. Now,  I wouldn't say I'm a huge Stephen King fan, but I've read approximately two-thirds of his novels and have liked almost all of them. I picked up this novel with huge expectations, yet was really let down. The book was decent and interesting, I sped through it. However, it just wasn't that scary. Personally I just can't find topiary animals (especially a topiary rabbit) all that scary. Are they going to stab you with their branches? Eat you with their leaf teeth? Also, after seeing Jack Nicholson swing that axe in the movie, there's no way I'm finding a croquet mallet all that scary. I guess another reason I didn't really like this book that much was I didn't like any of the characters.  The mother was a simpering housewife who had absolutely no brain (although I understand this was the 70's), Danny was okay but I don't particulary care for little children, and I could not stand Jack. This guy throws a pity party for himself every day of the week. Jack's development and his descent into madness is very well done but I just have no sympathy for this guy he would just annoy me if I met him in real life. Anyways overall the book was okay but I don't think it was one of King's best and if you're expecting it to be the scariest thing you've ever read prepare to be disappointed. In defense of this book though I think I approached it with the highest expectations which probably would have been impossible to meet.
B000089CJI|5.0|Having both Death Cab AND The Postal Service under his hat makes Ben a very special boy! <br /> <br />When you think Postal Service, think Pet Shop Boys vocals mixed with amazingly good beat driven tracks with surprisingly good lyrical value...well, considering.  <br /> <br />I loved this album the second time i listened to it, and since then, there's been no going back for me. I love Ben's voice, however much some hardcores may say he sounds like a woman, he doesn't, okay. His delicate voice along with a mixture of delicate synth (such as bubbly beeps and scratchy drum beats) will take you away...*sigh* <br /> <br />The first track on the album \\"The District Sleeps alone Tonight\\" starts out gently with Ben's beautiful voice and a disjointed drum beat and a couple of those gentle beeping synth sounds i was talking about. The song misguides you to think that the whole song will be slow and violin driven, but then there is a sudden change after the second chorus which introduces a slightly faster rhythm and drum beat, which along with Ben's god damn fantastic voice finishes the song fantastically.  <br /> <br />Such Great Heights could have been made into a single if The Postal Service was just a LLIIIIIITLE more mainstream :p... this track has a fantastic synth bass-line, along with scratchy drums and melodic beeps. It all works well with the cheesy love-laced lyrics. Think of someone special when listening to this.  <br /> <br />Nothing Better is unusual childlike intrumentals, but the verses are good and the music is good and it's all good.  <br /> <br />Clark Gable is a good song, laced with beeping that sounds like something from a surgical procedure, but that's okay because once the bouncy drum beat sets in, you're set for a song that will carry you to the end with a good rhythm both vocally and intrumentally.  <br /> <br />This Place Is a Prison is a little more brooding than the rest of the tracks on this album. Gibbard's voice takes you into a world of sadness as a beautiful \\"ahhhhing\\" sound sets in and  he sings, \\"I know there's a big world out there, like the one that i saw on the screen, in my living room late last night, it was almost too bright, to see\\" Beautiful, but takes more than one listen.  <br /> <br />This song was good the first time i heard it. Not only does it use the Mario videogame sound as it's driving beat :p, but it encorporates another of those great eerie bass-lines and steady drum rhythm. Trust me, you'll love this track :) <br /> <br />Natural Anthem finishes off this album and rightly so, it's a great track. More ferocious than the other gentler tracks, it just screams \\"native\\". Wonderful instrumentals for a truly uplifting and driven song. Nearing the end, Gibbard takes the chance to actually sing to this song, and does it well, as it takes a dive to a less raging level. If you're interested, the lyrics are mainly in regards to the song and it's cause. :) <br /> <br />The Postal Service certainly delivered with this somewhat short but extremely pretty and pleasing audio.  <br /> <br />Give Up is an awesome album from a two person band that started out sending mp's in the mail :)
B0002WZTPC|5.0|First of all, anyone who grew up during the 80's knows that this movie was not only well received, but made much money and was indeed a classic. It was unique and nothing up to that point had been produced that came close. Now that the 80's are gone, many people expect movies to be 100% accurate and to give them some sort of life-changing experience. Movies are fun!!! There supposed to be entertaining, not life-changing and realistic. If you haven't noticed, television isn't really concerned with getting it's audience in touch with reality or 101 course in Naval aviation...it's for entertainment. Having said that, lose all the unrealistic expectations, go find something else besides a movie to change your life, and sit back and enjoy this quality flick.
B00006F83Y|5.0|When you think rock, think Queens... <br />some say it's \\"stoner\\" rock, others say it's just damn good...i say both :). <br /> <br />Lets see what we have on here... <br /> <br />Your opening track is friggin goood, it's little more screamie than the others, but it has a great, fast-paced rythm.  <br />No One Knows is one that everyone knows :) it sticks in your head and like many of the other songs on this album, it's guitar work makes you say, \\"Thank god i'm NOT deaf\\".  <br />First It Giveth is my favourite track on this album, it's got the best riffs and vocals and EVERYTHING is good about this song, if you liked No One Knows, this song will make sweet love to you :) <br />The rest of the album goes along pretty much the same sound, with undeniably good use of drums and guitar. One freak song only :p, Six Shooter is not for little children :) <br /> <br />Hidden tracks are Mosquito Song (a little more slow paced, less beat driven and pretty much acoustic, but a beautie all the same) <br />and <br />EveryBody's Gonna be Happy (a funny song and slightly uncharacteristic mood for the band, but still good guitar work, and a painfully joyful and cheesy chorus with clapping... <br /> <br />This band is good, even though the bass player smokes frequently during gigs :p  <br />I loved this album, tis completely awesome, take a couple of spins of it and you'll see...it's gooooood!

B00005JMJ4|1.0|I was looking no star rating for this movie. It is not fair that some of the reviews said that if you don't like the film, go rent XXX or some action-packed film. I like many kinds of movies, not only the XXX kinds, in fact I watch many art house movies (many of them are crap! artistic for the sake of it, or lack of budget). We can enjoy movies in many different ways and watch movies and apreciate them from many different angles. I really cannot find anything in Lost In Translation that is worth shouting about. The story does not move me in anyway, just two lone people hanging out in Tokyo; they don't inspire each other after the meeting; their life is not changed in any way, for better or worse; there is no beautiful cinematography or any interesting camera works, the list goes on, the charactors just met, hang out and say goodbye when the 2-hours is up. The movie is flat in every angle of a movie. I tried to find something in the movie that every critic is raving about, and I found nothing, I was still hoping something will happen while the credit was rolling, and still nothing. I was not less surprise than Copolla herself when the movie won an Oscar. Still puzzled about the hype.
B0006GAOCW|4.0|Katie Holmes proves charming as daughter of the President of the United States in the romantic drama `First Daughter.' From director Forest Whitaker, `First Daughter' features Holmes' playing the character of Samantha Mackenzie - a freshman who navigates college classes, while dealing with testy roommates and romantic entanglements - all under the ever watching eyes of a cadre of Secret Service bodyguards.<br /><br />Add Michael Keaton as a President running for reelection and Marc Blucas (from the television series `Buffy the Vampire Slayer') as a graduate student with a secret agenda to the mix and the ingredients are all here for an enjoyable, if not intellectually stimulating, diversion for a couple of hours.<br /><br />Where this DVD fails, however, is its delivery on special features. We have a very short featurette on the choreographed ballroom dancing scenes, as well as a tribute piece to the famous composer Michael Kamen who died shortly after starting work on the picture.<br /><br />There are also two deleted scenes that are actually merely extensions on existing scenes - more birth control products for Samantha as she endeavors to make her boyfriend jealous and more of Holmes dancing on the bar. They add nothing to the picture and its quite obvious why the extra seconds were trimmed from the final theatrical release.<br /><br />Where the DVD does deliver the goods though is in the rather laid back commentary from the three young stars (Holmes, Blucas and Amerie). It starts a little slow, but soon livens up as the three began to relax. The three share some entertaining anecdotes about life on the set, and their experiences working with Michael Keaton. However, the commentary also highlights what is missing from the DVD as the three discuss all the outtakes from the picture, and Blucas even speculates (incorrectly as it turns out) as to their presence on the DVD.<br /><br />As is the case with so many releases these days, we have the cropped full-screen version on one side of the disc and the original theatrical widescreen presentation on the flip side, with the special features split (half on each side).disc and the original theatrical widescreen presentation on the flip side, with the special features split (half on each side).
0330412302|5.0|fuller's memoir is a tough but beautiful look at the hard-scrabble life of growing up as a white colonial daughter-of-an-alcoholic-mother in war-torn african states.  i wouldn't recommend this book to my grandmother or great aunt - the tone is certainly a bit in-your-face with its frequent references to alcoholism, lost babies, and constant injuries.  nonetheless fuller seems simply honest, steadfastly direct rather than delicate, and while walking a tiptoe line of creating shock in the reader, it never solidly dives over the line into gratuitous violence, admirably keeping some distance as the matter-of-fact observations of a child.  i found it very well-written, and very hard to put down.  if the tone sounds too strong for you, try the older \\"flame trees of thika\\" series, which also make fascinating comparisons to fuller in terms of both africa and the authors modern approach.
1594200106|1.0|I had been looking forward to this book and when I finally read it, was deeply disappointed.  Part of this may be due to inappropriate expectations - I think I'd been hoping for a literary mystery in the 'Possession' mould - but the book doesn't even succeed as a Gothic thriller.  The characterisation (with the exception of Fermin) was perfunctory, the plot both over-complicated and excessively simple (anyone out there not guess who Leatherface was within minutes of his introduction?). By the end, I'd lost all interest in who'd done what and why, and just wanted the whole sorry saga to be over.  The author's attempt to generate suspense over the narrator's eventual fate was a cheap narrative trick that didn't work.  The writing was  untidy and included such infelicities as the author's voice taking over in a letter from one character to another, to enable her to describe events she had not witnessed.  Very sloppy, wouldn't recommend.
B00005JNEI|4.0|Practically if you were Republican, you did not watch this simple as that. I however had different reasons for not watching this mainly because being an Irishman I thought that since I do not vote in the American elections it's not really going to help me that much. I wouldn't say that this was a flaw......it's just that it felt like a propaganda machine about George W Bush's time in power and how he used September 11th 2001 to his advantage and if you really did watch this you'd really have to vote John Kerry...... <br /> <br />......so here we are, Bush is still in power ( so much for the propaganda working ) and so I finally watch the documentary. And it is shocking. You see the horrors of the brutality of war and there is no sugary-sweet rendition and you see that American media is not allowed to show the mass amount of American coffins and the changes in the opinion of one Lila Lipscomb. Beforehand she's just a regular \\" conservative Democrat \\" who is proud that her son and others are fighting to free the Iraqi people. But from what? The people there seem not to mind Saddam. Even though I'm skeptical that all Iraqis love Saddam I do have to wonder where George Bush got these Iraqis thanking him that he freed the Iraqi people.....it's a very strange set of affairs when you find that most of the children in Iraq are at a funfair while GWB declares war on Iraq. It pretty much is certain that this was an agenda motivated by the fact that we \\" don't forget this guy almost shot my daddy dead.\\" Which shows that Iraq was an entirely personal agenda which doesn't even begin to explain how dangerous this president is. <br /> <br />What I find more disturbing is the one elderly Iraqi woman feeling completely enraged by what is happening to her fellow countrymen. She's almost manic with rage and tears for her dead countrymen and women. It's frightening and I can fully sympathize with her. When Lila discovers that her son had died in the line of duty and feels similar feelings of dismay and betrayal....although it is moving you don't honestly get the same sense of violent rage and, as bad as this probably sounds, you don't feel as sorry for her ( which I sincerely do feel sorry for her don't get me wrong ) as the Iraqi woman. Besides after seeing how the American army treated it's prisoners it's really hard for you to portray them as the good guys. <br /> <br />While there are a few inaccuracies somewhere in the film ( you probably might see them along the way, you might not ), and you may still get the overriding sense that this is a propaganda machine ( if you live outside the US ), there is a sense that the film means well and tries to show a different view that is not shown by the American media. Even still, this film really is just preaching to the converted so if you think Bush has done a good job and are unflinching in your support, you know what you think. However it would be nice if everyone saw this movie in America but......you can't depend on people's beliefs just to change just like that. Anyway look on the bright side people, it's his last term so he can't do anything more after that although the downside is he's still probably scheming his next plan up and god help the world whatever it is
B0006HXXBA|5.0|As other reviewers have illuded to, this album may be better than earlier Kreator albums because with the exception of \\"Ventor\\" all the instruments have gotten better over the years. Most importantly, Kreator has learned to write a really good, well put together song.    After spending almost a decade in non-Thrash, experimental areas of metal, Kreator have returned with a Thrash album that amazingly doesn't sound rehashed. All the riffs are really amazing and most importantly, they're memorable. Former albums like Endless Pain and Pleasure to Kill, Terrible Certainty, and Extreme Aggression all sounded good and had a lot of fury at the time, but all of them except for Pleasure to Kill were just run-of-the-mill Thrash songs.    This is rare but I don't think there is a song that I don't like. You know how there is always that one song on the album that you think is really lame? It's not here...And even though the music is Thrash it never ceases to be interesting, always being creative.    The production is really good for this album and it shows that they spent a lot of time on the editing. The guitars are definitely the highlighted instrument of the album. Great guitar work, complicated but furious with tons of aggression. The vocalist, Mille Petrozza, sounds more possessed than ever screaming the ideological lyrics. The best thing is that his voice hasn't changed much if at all. The bass is non-existent for most of the album (if there even is one) and all the better. (I mean come on, this ain't Forced Entry here!) The drumming is good, especially the opening fill on \\"Impossible Brutality\\" and the break in \\"Enemy of God\\". As a drummer, I can listen and appreciate all the beats.    If you loved stuff like Nuclear Assault, Slayer, Megadeth, Sodom, Destruction, Coroner, Exodus, Heathen, Sadus, D.R.I., Hirax, Anthrax, Whiplash etc. prepare to get you #ss kicked.  The old days may be over but in the same way this CD sounds \\"so old\\" yet \\"so new\\". Yes, this album is thatgood. Better than any of the other Thrash bands that came out with albums in 2004. Get IT NOW!

B0001UL7RY|1.0|I don't know why everybody likes Avril Lavigne but me.  Her voice is screechy and tinney.  The lyrics are self pitying and whiney.  The guitars drone and make noise far more often than anything even remotely passable as music.  Not to mention the fact that she was manufactured by her record company! <br /> <br />Also, the biggest reason why I don't like her is because she is the trashiest and sleaziest pop star I've ever seen.  It looks like she hasn't bathed in 10 years!  Its disgusting!  She looks like a hooker who has to sell her body in order to pay for her heroin habit. <br /> <br />Can you belive Derik Whebley from sum 41 wants to marry this filthy animal?  I wouldn't want to come within 100 feet of it.
B00005B4GU|5.0|This is definitely one of Radiohead's least accessible albums.  Once you get past the early stages, it becomes a brilliant album. Highly recommended  <br /> <br />Highlights: <br />Pyramid Song <br />You and Whose Army? <br />Dollars and Cents <br />Like Spinning Plates <br />Life in a Glass House
B000002572|3.0|I angers me the way music snobs write this album off as \\"dated\\" and \\"cheesy arena rock\\".  Do you arena rock haters realise that one of your \\"cool\\" alternative bands ripped off a Boston song?  Listen to \\"More than a Feeling\\" (1976), then listen to Nirvana's \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" (1991).  The riffs are almost identical.  Arena rock bands are way more talented than alternative bands.  Why do you think they have to steal their songs? <br /> <br />

044024157X|4.0|John Grisham has published legal thrillers for years.  This time, he's returned to the roots of his first book (A Time To Kill) with a minor character, and a different perspective, both from the hero, and the time (1970 - 1979).  <br /> <br />The hero in question is a journalist... though perhaps a failed one.  He couldn't hack it in college, and went to the small town of Clanton, Mississippi.  His boss was probably mentally reduced in any case - it was all about the obits.  When they are dead, glorify them.  When the paper goes into bankruptcy, our hero gets a loan from his grandmother to buy it... and thus his story. <br /> <br />It's a tale of a small town, with legal justice, blacks who made good, a powerful local boy who went bad, a trial, different churches, and good ole boy justice.  After all, somebody is killing off the powerful and weathly son of a clan who got released... after a conviction for murder and rape.   <br /> <br />In then end I do relate to the first person of the story.  He reported, he published, he fit in, he served the community.  In the end, he sold out, but only for a high price... and I think he deserved the money and the luxuries it bought him.  He gave a lot  to build up the paper - over 9 years.
067101756X|1.0|It's hard to believe anyone takes Corso seriously. The man was delusional to the point where he maintains that much of the world's technology is alien related, and would not have gone anywhere if it hadn't been for him. An ego gone haywire. <br /> <br />The Roswell 'crash' is the biggest most ludicrous red herring ever in UFOland. I believe extraterrestrials may be out there and could be visiting but Roswell quite clearly was not a UFO crash; it was a a top secret weather balloon from Project Mogul. How a few bits of wood and plastic scattered around a farm got to be the centre of UFO mania for nearly 60 years is mind boggling. I think if people were not so ready to believe anyone's tales of UFOs and abductions then perhaps the 'science' would not be so ridiculed. People need to get a grip on reality before they start believing anything. <br /> <br />Corso had nothing to lose writing this book; he was old, too old to care what others thought, most of the people mentioned in the book have been dead a long time - useful for him when concocting his farcical stories. And money was what he had to gain - tonnes of it because the bigger the story the bigger the hit. <br /> <br />There are too many conmen making too much money out of UFOs (Roswell's inhabitants must be chuckling about that with all their museums) and hence I, a sceptical believer, cannot take most of these tales at all seriously. Don't buy this rubbish because it only encourages more con artists to give us more of the same.
044022165X|5.0|Rudy Baylor has nothing.  He delivered pizzas and waited tables to get through college and law school.  He passed the bar, and got his licence - and one interesting case in a throwaway class in his last year at law school. <br /> <br />Circumstances force him into ambulance chasing with a man who never passed the bar.  But Rudy's one case is legal dynamite.  His clients were the victims of a bad-faith case that is textbook.  He has the dirt, and has the witnesses that has the dirt.  He has a favorable judge.  He is even smart enough to know how to turn the defendent's high priced lawyers into unwitting shills for his case. <br /> <br />Maybe being a rookie with nothing to lose worked in his favor.  He had no money, no professional reputation, or anything else to lose.  The trial scenes are amazing.  The green kid, the rookie, absolutely humilates the defendants, as well as the best legal defense money can buy.  Trust me, they wre rueing the day that he was ever born.   <br /> <br />Yeah, Grisham rigged the facts, the evidence, and everything to favor the rookie... in short a case any trial lawyer would love, combined with the favorable judge.  It's still fun.  I have to say though, if Grisham could rig the trial in Baylor's favor, he could rig the outcome.  Maybe the point is that his client got the justice she deserved, I have to feel her lawyer should have walked away from it all with the money.  Still, he got the girl - and maybe that was enough.  Along with the knowledge he quit being on top.
B0006A9FMI|1.0|If you look at some of the other reviews on this page, you'll see that I'm not the only one who thinks Dreamworks messed this release up pretty badly.  I wonder if the Japanese crew who made it knows what the quality is like for the North American release.  The cover art is not attractive (at all), and looks like an independent anime release from the late eighties.  The subtitles are poorly executed and almost comical.  The voices are still in Japanese, which is fine, but, even when they are cheesy, dubs allow viewers to take in a lot more of the film, as well as create authenticity for the characters.  Do not waste your time or money on this - wait for a rerelease by Dreamworks or a good release by someone else.
0452285186|5.0|i initially got this book as a christmas present from a friend, being a bunny owner myself i was speechless at first because generally speaking i alway yell at people when they say things about my bunny but after flipping through it i couldn't contain myself. it really is quite amusing if a bit twisted. i would recomend this for anyone over the age of 13 that has a weird sense of humor.
B000068PQ0|5.0|This is my first Flaming Lips album but its also one of the most unique albums I've ever heard. Take Pink Floyd or the Moody Blues digitally treat the instruments and add in some lush electronic orchestration and you've come close to the magic of the Flaming Lips. The production is glossy and sterile, one of the most over produced albums but it actual enhances the quality of the music. The songs seem to have been wrapped around a concept at one point, dealing with a oriental girl, Yoshimi, who is battling large pink robots bent on human annihilation. However, only the first four songs seem to stay true to this loose concept, the rest mainly deal with themes of standing up for what you believe in and the meaning of life. The record starts off strong with the great \\"Fight Test\\". Most of the songs are built around a crisp acoustic guitar and reverberated bass lines. From there the songs blossom into electronic techno symphonies. The first half of the album is strong and could have been united into one suite, all the songs dealing with a common theme and the songs revolving around the same guitar/electronic beat structure. After that the album becomes more varied and the cuts deal with different subjects and life ideals. The Flaming Lips are so unique in that they take familiar melodies and song structures from 60's and 70's prog rock and psychedelia and inject 21st century beats and digital tricks but at the core the songs are first rate pop. The Lips take their dream pop and add a dash of lyseric playfulness, that combined with a healthy dose of large white bunnies, red robots and petite oriental girls and you've got a good picture of this album. Anyways if you like trip hop, psychedelia, dream pop or anything that isnt conventional than this would be a great buy.
068987474X|4.0|It was just an empowering book.  I think it speaks very positively of women and is just encouraging us to take men as they are.  If they are not into us...we need to get over it, and I think Greg has many good points.
B0002Z0EYA|5.0|<br />Just a quick word. Something that bothers me a little. I must admit I find it somewhat humorous that a few of these \\"literary scholars\\", legitimately ordained or not, comment on the \\"travesty\\" and mockery that a current day producer made of this classic. It's HOLLYWOOD...what'd you expect? Honestly, no epic film ever follows the epic book. \\"It ruins the story...\\" I didn't realize the Iliad was a factual story to begin with. With the idea of brevity in mind, I say this: Watch a movie for the movie's sake, people. Hollywood will continually spin off books, because the book taken as a complete entity, doesn't usually work. \\"The Trojan war lasted years...blah\\" The movie was already two and a half hours. How long could Wolfgang play this thing out? And there will always be a love interest. Fight Club had a love interest. Because as much as we all complain about it, it's what draws us in. It keeps us coming back for more. Take a movie for the movie's sake, and a book for the book's sake. Period. So with that being said, this movie owned. Besides, who doesn't like seeing the Pitster with his shirt off (something for the guys and girls...=) )?  <br /> <br />Have fun with it people. Don't over analyze things. Peace.
B000005IU2|5.0|This album is like a fist being thrust out of the thick, primordial sludge of rock and roll, only to grab the shore and drag itself out to take a look around. After looking around and seeing what there is to offer on shore, it jumps back in the sludge, content.<br /><br />The first 4 or 5 songs really rock then it all kind of justs falls apart on the last few songs. But songs like \\"Down On The Street\\" and \\"Loose\\" kick more arse than a band has a right to. I just can't fathom this record was made in like 1970. It's basic, primordial rock, but man does it get you going!
B0006399FS|5.0|Well, this album certainly seems to have garnered a diversity of opinion. Count me in the group that hails this as a masterpiece. It's worth buying for the Yaweh track alone, but don't overlook such other gems as One Step Closer, Miracle Drug, and Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own. The track \\"Love and Peace or Else\\" has gotten a lot of praise, but I don't care for it much. The IPod anthem, \\"Vertigo\\", shows U2 at their rollicking best - but no doubt everyone on the globe has heard it already (even if they don't listen to the radio.) <br /> <br />Highly recommended.
6305252521|5.0|Jim Carrey's second best film, in my opinion. Strange, it's not even a comedy. <br /> <br />Truman Burback leads a pretty ordinary life. He gets up, goes to work, has his best friend, his wife, etc. One day, strange things start happening around him and suddenly, Truman starts to see that all isn't as it appears. <br /> <br />Truman's entire life....is a lie. Everything, everyone. It's all a lie. A reality show that began with his birth. He's been on television 24-7 ever since. He begins to think that there's more outside of his little town, and decides to go looking for his first love, but everyone seems intent on keeping him there, even nature itself (which is controlled by the network). <br /> <br />This film has it's humor, don't get me wrong, but I like it for other reasons. I think this is a picture of a possible future for television, a bad future. Everything is a reality show - why not an entire life?
0767817478|1.0|Okay first off im a g fan. For those who are not im going to get something clear. ONE, youre always calling godzilla corny from his old movies. Why do you think they ended in the 70s? Have youll even seen any of the movies made up till 95? This movie sucked. The only thing it had in common with godzilla is his voice. Godzilla also was not created by the french. He was a gojirasaurus on an island called largos that during WW2 was hit by a nuclear bomb. In this movie he is an iguana hit by radiation. The original godzilla also was a metaphor of the sins that man committed. Godzilla was a terrible reminder of how small and careless the human race really is. Another thing why in the world would a creature made in the pasific move to NY? If the movie takes place in america shouldn't be in LA? All this movie shows is how dumb newyorkers can be(no offense). Oh for all you people that think this godzilla is better, watch godzilla final wars(his last movie this year when it gets to america)The japanese put the american godzilla all CG just the way he looks against the real godzilla, man in a suit. Just so you know the fight is not a long one...
B0002KVUKM|3.0|For all of its campy charm, one could hardly describe VanHelsing as \\"innovative\\" in its narrative structure. This is the kind of movie that will allow you a protracted bathroom break in pretty much any given spot--and you can be guaranteed a return to your seat having missed nothing that you hadn't guessed already. But as long as you're in the market for 2 hours of hot people in cool clothes, well, hang onto your hats--because our hero is wearing a LOT of clothes.<br /><br />Whether he's swinging from a cable over Notre Dame or zipping on horseback over the snow-covered mountains of eastern Europe, dear VanHelsing is sporting enough outerwear to dress every toothless, pitchfork-bearing villager in Transylvania. Yeah, I'll be the first to say it--he looks bulky. Uncomfortable, even. As if he's sporting a wine cask underneath that nifty vest, possibly.<br /><br />In short, it wasn't the most flattering arrangement of leather and turtleneck that ever a good-looking superhero did don. Hugh spends the first hour and a half of the flick looking more bloated than hunky, and by the time he gets around to actually removing a bit of this cumbersome costume, it's (a). towards the very end of the movie and (b). a mere six seconds before he goes about morphing into something way ugly. You thought he was hairy in X-Men. Ha.<br /><br />And then there's Kate, as bitchy-but-delectable Anna. There's not much to be said about her in this, really, except that yes--she looks great. Her costume makes up for everything imperfect about VanHelsing's, though by the time she finishes loading up with weaponry the outfit must weigh 80 pounds. Every now and again you get all excited as she reaches for a buckle--thinking, \\"hey, maybe she's going to slip into something more comfortable!\\" But she's usually just making adjustments to her Bat-Belt, which is hanging off her hips like a cast-iron hula skirt. I bet that sucker chafed.<br /><br />At least VanHelsing thought to remove Anna's waist-contrivance when he gassed her and deposited her in her bedroom (for her own good), though he went ahead and left the tummy-pinching corset in place. It's no surprise that Anna wakes up cranky--trust me, if you sleep in one of those things you'll come to consciousness feeling like you've been beaten around the ribs with a baseball bat.<br /><br />Then again, if Hugh Jackman put me to bed and I woke up alone, with all my clothes still on, I'd probably be pissed too.<br /><br />Right. So. We've got Hugh and Kate dashing around, fighting vampires and werewolves, and somehow getting mixed up with the Frankenstein monster--who turns out not to be such a bad guy after all. Naturally, Count (\\"Bwah\\") Dracula is behind all the mayhem, as he + his Freaky Brides Three are trying to reproduce in an elaborate and unlikely manner that requires a buttload of electricity [which in a roundabout way explains why a maniacal German scientist opted to build a castle in Transylvania. Sort of.].<br /><br />Anyway, as you might expect, this movie lends itself spectacularly to MST3K behavior. The dialogue is clunky and either (a). just plain bad or (b). an attempt to be ironic that fails to register with those of us who have been blinded by the CGI, so by all means feel free to contribute your own running commentary. It's too damn easy.<br /><br />But I say all of that to say this--it's never boring. Even when the action on screen falls short of making sense, there's always something nice to look at; and even though the dialogue is bad, the people being forced to work with it are clearly doing their best to make the most of a bad situation. VanHelsing is no masterpiece by any stretch of anyone's imagination; it's sensory overload from the opening frame, the storyline falls apart at regular intervals, and apparently Budapest and Italy are either a month's travel apart or 12 hours, depending on how badly you need an antidote for lycanthropy. And don't expect the ending to redeem this mess--the closing sequence is nothing short of godawful in its insistence upon cliche cheesiness. When the clouds parted and the faces appeared in heaven, I was less moved by the moment on the screen before me than by my recollections of The Lion King.<br /><br />But seriously, it's not the worst movie I've ever seen by far.this mess--the closing sequence is nothing short of godawful in its insistence upon cliche cheesiness.

B00007KMP1|5.0|I've been a Beck fan since since \\"Stereopathetic Soul Manure\\" and know his work from start to finish. \\"Sea Change\\" is far and away one of the best CDs human's have ever had the chance to hear. It is addictive, depressing without bringing you down, and phenominally produced. Believe it or not, the SACD version is even better with a true 5.1 multi-channel track. However, it is a true remix with significant differences from the 2 channel CD. The strings on Paper Tiger and Lonesome Tears are chrystal clear, so much so that the vibration of the individual strings seem to fill the room with presence. The guitar work shines through in places where it is barely detectable on the original CD. The multi-channel reverb leaves one with a sense that Beck is singing in the room with you.  <br /> <br />I could type a 20 page review on this SACD, but I'll keep it simple. There is one song that seems to have suffered, \\"End of the Day\\". It sounds as though the engineer made a boo-boo about half way through the song and hit fader for one synth part that is much louder than the surrounding music. Only Beck's unpredictibility left me wondering if it was intentional or not. Otherwise this SACD is a picture of perfection.
B0006A9FKA|5.0|I've heard a lot of mixed reaction to this movie, though the buzz is primarily positive -- touting the flick's exceptional funny, its glorious messy, and its marvelous silly.<br /><br />Maybe I'm just a big fat dork who spent too much time in graduate school, but I seemed to plug into this movie on a somewhat different plane of appreciation. For thing one, I didn't think it was terribly funny.  It had its moments, but I wouldn't go so far as to call it a \\"comedy.\\" And for a second thing, I found it genuinely suspenseful -- which is not something you often hear shouted from the applause bandwagon. More often than not I hear that it's \\"a laugh riot in the tradition of Scary Movie.\\" This comparison has been waved around several times in print and online, and it seems wildly off-base to me, if not downright insulting.<br /><br />The Scary Movie franchise, while being fun for what it is, is not supposed to mean anything. It's simple parody, produced for masses which are only marginally discriminatory in their entertainment requirements. SOTD has entirely too much going on inside to be relegated to mere imitation status.<br /><br />George Romero and his apologists have long insisted that the original Dawn of the Dead (and its zombies-in-the-mall theme) was a satire on the mindless consumerism and the tedium of modern life. This is the critical equivalent of putting an evening gown on a pig, but whatever. The very same theme was tackled much more effectively without zombies in American Beauty, and much better with zombies in Shaun of the Dead -- a film which actually manages to make a clever statement on the subject.<br /><br />Much of the perceived hilarity in this film occurs at the beginning and the end, wherein the satire is more light-hearted (if unsubtle). The great conceit of the first thirty-five minutes is that the zombies are encroaching upon Shaun's day-to-day reality bubble ... but he doesn't notice, and at first, neither does anyone else. The drooling, coughing, slowly lumbering undead gradually replace the drooling, coughing, slowly lumbering pulse-bearing characters who have periodic walk-on roles in Shaun's life. But no red flags are raised.<br /><br />Shaun is neither bothered by the change nor molested by the zombies themselves, who (one is led to suspect) view him as one of their own. He wanders through his daily routine as if he's wearing blinders; he's worn a rut between his home and his place of employment, and this rut is so deep that it serves as a psychological buffer. Shaun is furthermore isolated from the impending threat by his post-getting-dumped state of sorrow, which prevents him from paying closer attention to his surroundings.<br /><br />But eventually, the carnage cannot escape the notice of even the hopelessly self-involved Shaun and his filthy-yet-lovable best friend Ed. Action must be taken. His parental units must be rescued. Liz, despite her fresh status of ex-girlfriend, must be saved. Shaun and Ed have, at their collective disposal: one zombiefied roommate's vehicle, a cricket bat, and a plan to seek shelter at a pub called the Winchester.<br /><br />Quoth the Blues Brothers: \\"Hit it.\\"<br /><br />At any rate, although the movie ends on an \\"up\\" note (more or less) and there were giggles to be had, I found the bulk of the film to be calculated and oppressive -- a deftly executed surgical extraction of a man from his suffocating safety zone, and a grim (yet oddly uplifting) morality fable about appreciating what you have without unthinking presumption. All in all, I thought this was a damn fine film and I really enjoyed it.

B00005JMX6|1.0|I was reported... The people of Amazon got a look at my review... And it was deleted.  I already stated why I hate this movie, so I'll just rant about the people who were offended by my first review (entitled This Movie Gave Me Blue Balls).  And when this one gets deleted too, I'll rant some more. <br /> <br />I wouldn't get mad if it was taken off because it was pure spam, but since it wasn't, I've questioned the logic about some people who found my review offensive.  It's ironic how anyone could be offended by anything I said since you guys are the ones checking out this movie.  Here is what I believe most people were offended by: <br /> <br />-My negative attitude toward the movie.  Oh boo hoo!  Some one has a different opinion than you do, now let's report the guy.  How about you realize that not everyone is going to like the stereotypes, the shallowness, and the boredom that is induced by this movie as you do? <br /> <br />-Its vulgarity.  Yes, this one astounded me too.  People were actually offended because I said that this movie gave me blue balls (a joke, and a catchy statement to make people actually read my review, by the way).  Hello!  If it was the vulgarity that offended you, why then are you looking at the reviews of such a movie?  The movie only has vulgarities and sexual innuendos about every minute, so why should the reviews be any different or not mention them? <br /> <br />-The reality.  It feels good when you like something you think is very good, until you get a reality check served to you on a plate.  People just can't stand that this movie sucked, and that they do too. <br /> <br />Oh, and, let the reporting commence.
B00005JN2Z|5.0|Won't go into details as they are covered throughly by other reviews.  Did not expect much as the movie had not be highly rated in it's theatre release. Surprised, right from the start with my association to the characters ( excellent actors and screen play ).  While exciting, it seemed real.  Certainly one of the best movies of the year.  Recommend highly!
B000035P7X|5.0|I saw \\"Don't Look Back\\" again the other day, my first time in a number of years. I actually was prompted to this after seeing the recent Bob Dylan interview on \\"60 Minutes\\" (to promote his equally astonishing memoir \\"Chronicles-Volume 1\\"). Were you as astonished by the \\"60 Minutes\\" piece as I was? In any event, \\"Don't Look Back\\" is essential on so many levels: first and foremost, it gives us a never-since equalled candid view at life (on the road) with Dylan. While it does contain a number of performances, \\"Don't Look Back\\" is not a concert movie. It's more a pre-concert movie than anything else, watching Dylan getting ready to perform in the \\"Green Door\\" and other performing halls' waiting rooms. The film also remains essential as a looking glass onto England, 1965, with its gritty, if not to say seemingly always gray outlook and feel to it.<br /><br />Back to the \\"60 Minutes\\" interview. When I was watching it, it felt so familiar. Even though the interviews are separated by almost 40 years, Dylan played the \\"60 Minutes\\" interviewer in very much the same way he played the British journalists in 1965, although admittedly in a somewhat nice fashion now. Watch again the \\"interview\\" Dylan did with the reporter from \\"Time Magazine\\" towards the end of \\"Don't Look Back\\", it's the highlight of the movie for me.<br /><br />The live performances in \\"Don't Look Back\\" are equally essential, if for no other reason that you are watching Dylan in Spring, 1965 (almost 40 years ago to the day!), a mere months before turning electric at the Newport Festival. From an audio perspective, the performances in \\"Don't Look Back\\" are very similar to the material covered in the 2 CD set \\"Dylan Live 1964\\", issued in Spring of 2004. The staying power of \\"Don't Look Back\\" 40 years later is proof that this movie is essential for any Dylan fan. Highly recommended!

0671449028|5.0|My two year old loves books and loves to be read to and you can clearly see his interest intensified by a book with colorful and funny illustrations like you get in this great book by Sandra Boynton.  The great rhyming text lends to the silliness of the book.  The fact that the characters preparing to go to bed by taking baths, brushing their teeth and getting into their pajamas are funny animals, makes it so much more entertaining for little ones.  My two year old gets a kick out of thinking that animals brush their teeth too and even tried to take his tooth brush and brush our dog's teeth!  Good thing we caught him in time!<br /><br />Sandra really seems to have a great grasp on what will appeal to young children and I am grateful to her for another wonderful book.

He gets a kick out of the words and pictures.  Sandra Reall knows her stuff.
B000641Z90|5.0|This is a very very special DVD I consider you MUST have. <br />Not only because is the last one you'll have with an entire full concert of Phil Collins, nor this is in fact an absolutely fantastic show with all his hits performed in a superb way, and what's more, with the most respectable musicians in today's music world. Image and sound quality are incredible with cameras everywhere except on the stage but this for exclusive decision of Phil himself. <br />The DVD set is also packed with a lot of fantastic extras (Don't miss the \\"Parking\\" clip starring Phil Collins as a Policeman !!!), something rare in previous Phil Collins DVD releases.  <br />Definitively this is one of those DVDs you should HAVE in your collection. You will see Phil performing at his best !!! <br />Get it and enjoy it ! <br />Believ me. You won't be disappointed. <br />
0060254920|5.0|There's a particular sense of joy you get as a parent when you can share something with your kids that you loved as a child.  Sadly so many things that we liked of popular culture of our days is no longer around to share with our kids.  Our TV shows are long gone for the most part, as well as the toys we played with.  But there are a few examples.  For one, I love being able to sit with ky kids during the holiday season and watching things like Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer and \\"A Charlie Brown Christmas\\"  It's just too bad they no longer have the Dolly Madison commercials!<br /><br />Where the Wild Things Are is another thing I can share with my kids that I experienced.  To think that 35 years later this wonderful book about the imagination of a child is still a top seller is amazing.  Funny and imaginative with beasts that look scary but never are make this a book that transends generations.  The beautiful illustrations take me back to the days when this was a regular read for me.  My 13 year old loved it and my two year old now loves it as well.
B0006A9FMI|4.0|GITS2: Innocence is well made and decent follow up to the first one. SO I can not understand why some reviewers are giving this film /DVD 1 star just because it's not dubbed in english or has subtitles /captions for sound effects etc. I don't think thats a fair way to judge a movie, for minor flaws or personally gripes or because you don't like to read. Judge it for it's content, the quality and relevance of the story on contemparary and future sub culture. The animation, action sequences and excellent artwork. Consider all the time and creativity put into the making of this film as you'll see in the bonus features.  <br /> <br />Like The first GITS and Blade Runner (and even the book that inspired both these films, Do Andrids Dream of Electric Sheep), the main characters, who are  either androids , half androids or don't know wether they are android or human, contemplate their own humanity. Do thoughts and memories make them human or is it flesh and blood make you human?  If I'm an android, then why do I care so much about my pet dog, and why do I miss my former partner, who is also not human? These are the sort of topics brought up throughout GITS 1 and 2 and what make them essential viewing, not neccassarily the CGI and action scenes, which are quite good here.  <br /> <br />So if you say the film is great but the captioning in bad and distracting, don't give it 1 star at least give it 3 stars then.   I will agree that reading the subtitles distracted me a bit from the visuals, so I used the pause button quite a bit. But I thought the story, plot and animation was intriguing , and I was not as confused watching GITS2 as I was with GITS with all the chatting about section 6 and section 9.  <br /> <br />This is why I give this Dvd 4 stars, for brilliant animation, intriguing story and twists, and informative bonus features. I would also love to see an English dubbed version when it does come out. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B0006399FS|5.0|Actual rating is 4.5  I've been a fan of this band for many years but I was really curious and cautious regarding the new U2 album considering all these 1 star reviewers (btw it seems most of them haven't written any other reviews for any other artists.....hmmmm)and people calling it a \\"sell out\\". U2 selling out??...Isn't this the same band that's sold 100's upon 100's of millions of copies of albums for the past 25 years??!!!??  And as far as I'm concerned the reasons for that go way beyond politics.  I think the best way to \\"understand\\" this album would be to try to compare the ideas (similarities, differences) between the songs \\"Sunday Bloody Sunday\\" and \\"Surrender\\" in relation to their YOUNGER ideology (musical style included) compared to what they seem to focus on now.   Anyway that aside, I'm still surprised by the negative response to this album.  Like one reviewer said, it helps to understand that it would be impossible to please everyone when some already prefer their 90's poppy new wave material to their earlier anthemic more stripped down sound and vice versa.  Even though I don't personally prefer one style over another I do know a good album when I FEEL it!  Actually this is  what I think ATYCLB should have sounded like. Not that that album was bad, far from it, but IMHO this is REALLY U2 returning to its roots, spiritually and above all musically.  Yes, this is probably a version of U2 that we've all heard before, but isn't that what returning to one's roots is supposed to be all about????  I truly find these songs, lyrically and musically, to be among the most moving and spiritually inspirational pieces this band has ever released.  Is it their best album??........no.  That would have to go to Achtung Baby, for a few reasons, the production being one of them.  But it certainly ranks right up there with the best of them.  For some reason though it seems a lot of people are going by the numbers on this one, over analyzing this music, quantity over quality.....guitars tuned way up loud??.....logical opener in 6th position???!!....childish lyrics???!!!!????...............    \\"I'm around the corner from anything that's real,   I'm across the road from hope,   I'm under a bridge in a rip tide that's taken everything I've called my own....one step closer to knowing\\"    \\"True love never can be rent, but only true love can make beauty innocent\\"    \\"I'm alive, i'm being born,   I just arrived,  I'm at the door of the place I started out from and I want back inside\\"    \\"Where are we now?  I've just got to let you know  A house still doesn't make a home   don't leave me here alone  sometimes you can't make it on your own\\"    I would have to bet against the possibility of  a \\"five year old\\" expressing these ideas let alone half of the other popular bands whose ambiguity is deemed today as being \\"original\\" and \\"creative\\".   As far as the vocals, Bono sounds just fine to me.  A bit raspy in places (miracle drug, all because of you) but to me that only adds to the bitterness and emotionality of the performence.  As a sidenote the album does come with the passing of Bono's father and is dedicated to his memory.  That in itself makes it hard for me to believe that power, greed, and fame were the only things on his mind when he was making this album.  All in all it sounds like.....a-hem.....an older and WISER U2 to me echoing back to an earlier simpler time.   So I guess all of us \\"rebels\\" can put down our white flags, for now anyway.  Listen with your heart as well as your ears!!
B0001HLVS2|2.0|As a long-time fan of both O'Brian and Forester, I looked forward very eagerly to this movie.  On seeing it, I certainly enjoyed the connection to the characters from O'Brian, but waited to write this review.  Now having watched the DVD a couple of times, I know what bothers me about the movie: the HUGE number of lost opportunities the screenplay represents! <br /> <br />Master and Commander (the book) was a great story.  It had a young Aubrey, showed the thrill of his promotion to commander, and had a series of fights.  It had intrigue, romance, storms, pomp and ceremony, heroism, betrayal--the lot. <br /> <br />So did Far Side of the World (the book).  The latter book also had espionage, intrigue, murder--lots of things on which to base a great movie. <br /> <br />Sad to say, the screenwriters took the two, cherry-picked the best stuff, *and based the movie on the rest*!!  Sure, the special effects are great--but the plot is stupid, the heroics ridiculous, and all the authenticity of O'Brian ruined for a few silly stunts. <br /> <br />All told, a great disappointment.
B00008GKEG|5.0|This 8-part documentary, collected on 4 DVDs (plus an additional disc of bonus material), is truly a must-have for serious Beatles fans. If you are unfamiliar with the history of the band and its development, you will learn a tremendous amount about how they all came together, and eventually how and why they drifted apart.  Over 600 minutes of footage will probably make for overkill for those only mildly interested in the band, but then again the story is so well put together you may find yourself with a renewed curiosity about and interest in the Beatles as well.    Candid interviews with Paul, George, Ringo, producer George Martin, and long-time associates such as Neil Aspinal point out both the highs and lows of the Beatles' days on tour, in the studio, and through some of their personal misadventures. The early episodes are full of terrific live footage of the band, whereas later episodes feature many of the proto-\\"music videos\\" the band produced when they no longer toured.     The bonus dvd, which includes material that was not broadcast on TV before, includes some great stuff as well. There are interviews with the production staff on how the Anthology was put together, more interviews and scenes with Paul, George, and Ringo, and my favorite part, which features them with George Martin playing back some old tapes at Abbey Road studio. It's fascinating to learn about how a track like \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" was put together, and the clips on the bonus dvd have a more relaxed and less formal feel than on the official \\"Anthology\\".    This production is definitely focused on the music of the band and their creative process. Very little is mentioned of their personal lives (wives, children, scandals, etc), no doubt a result of this being an \\"authorized\\" production. I found it interesting to read Peter Brown's \\"The Love You Make\\" at the same time I was watching this documentary, for Peter's book fills in a great many details only skimmed over here. Still, this is onlya minor quibble, as there is only so much that can be covered in even this many hours about the Beatles, and in the end it is the music that matters most, not who married or divorved who and when.    All in all this is a terrific document on one of--if not THE--most important bands ever in pop/rock music.
B0002F6AZC|3.0|After visionary horror director George Romero scored a mainstream hit with the original Creepshow, he served as an executive producer of this not well received sequel.  Creepshow 2 isn't as bad as many make it out to be, and the second story, entitled \\"The Raft\\", is worth checking this out for alone.  The film suffers without Romero's energetic directing, something which made the first film so great, but it has plenty of great gore effects (supervised by makeup maestro Tom Savini) which horror fans will eat up.  This Divimax edition DVD is yet another excellent release from Anchor Bay, with the film looking and sounding better than ever and with a few nice extras including a commentary, a documentary, and trailers.  The only glaring question about this release is, why Creepshow 2?  The first film, which can currently be found on a bare bones disc from Warner Bros. (Creepshow 2 can also be found as the same) deserves this kind of release, but horror fans know Anchor Bay for having a reputation of giving great treatments to underrated and classic horror films like Near Dark and the Hills Have Eyes, so maybe if you consider Creepshow 2 in the same category, that could serve as an explanation.  Now, maybe we'll get a bonus packed treatment of the first film.
0140544518|5.0|My almost 4-year-old thinks this is hands-down THE funniest book ever. The Big Bad One is just an average wolf with a headcold caught in some rather damning circumstances. The best kid's books weld wit, gross-out and action together and this has all that in spades. Excellent illustrations too.

And as for Biggie this is a great album. If you are planning to get Ready to Die, go a head and get this one. Not that the other one is bad theres just more things on here.
B00030590I|5.0|I saw this movie in the theatres and let me tell you, awesome!!  The cinematagrophy for the movie as well as the choreography for the fight scenes are just mesmorizing(very Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon-esque). I like how it is at least somewhat based on Historical events, with the first Chinese Emperor Shih Huang-ti playing a prominent role.  Along with this were small details like when Jet-li's character pays the blind musician he uses pieces of bronze(I think they were axe heads or something like that) that were really used for money in ancient China(or at least convincing replicas)!! In addition the overall message of the film I thought was good and profound.  I won't tell you what I think that message is, you will have to watch the movie and decide for yourself.
B00004TWZF|4.0|I first saw this movie when it came out in the theaters...I was around 11 and I loved it from the start and I still love it. I can watch it a hundred times (I probably have) and still watch it again! Now some of that can be from my crush on Jean Marc Barr and my liking Jean Reno a lot, but I think it's a sweet movie. Actually, one time I rented the movie on DVD and I noticed they had changed the ending....instead of a sad ending, they made it a happy ending.... I don't know which I like better....But that doesn't matter. It's a great movie and I highly recommend seeing it if you're into stuff like this. A sweet romantic movie.
B000002UJQ|5.0|..deserves five stars. I am only writing this to help get the average costumer rating back to 5 stars. I totally accept that some people doesnt like this album, but i really do! And i think that it deserves the credit of being rated average 5 stars.   <br />
B000001IQH|5.0|Forget if they are true punks or not? <br />If they are trying to be the Clash or not? <br /> <br />I bought this album having seen some of their videos on TV. <br />This is a great CD, much better than I had expected. <br />There is not a bad song on the whole Album. <br />So they were influenced by The Clash is that a bad thing? <br />No way. <br />What do you want? Influenced by Michael Bolton. <br /> <br />Go buy it NOW!
1402573219|4.0|The Audio Book version of this book is very entertaining as it uses a full cast - every character is voiced by a different actor - Anna, Sarah, Julia, Campbell, Brian - all fully fleshed out.  So many reviews have discussed the plotline that I don't need to go over it again.  Some people like the ending and some think it ruins the story.   <br /> <br />Unfortunately, I was listening to the ending of this book while on my way to work and arrived in tears.  If you think that it's sad reading, it's much more devastating hearing the last few chapters read aloud.   <br /> <br />A touching book with a interesting concept and plot.   <br /> <br />Recommended as an Audio Book.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I remember reading articles when I was living in Japan about this show and how good and smart of a sci-fi show it was.  Finally got a chance to get the dvd's and I have to say that although it was a little short, it was a wonderful journey with the crew of the Serenity.  Luckily, there is a movie coming out, and like one of the producers says on the dvd, hopefully the movie will be a success and lead to more episodes of this awesome series.
0142004235|5.0|East of Eden is fantastic.  I am usually a slower reader, but completed the 600 pages in less than a week.  Steinbeck's prose is enchanting.  The characters, particularly Sam Hamilton and Lee are entirely believable.   <br /> <br />The message of \\"thou mayest\\" is timeless and profound.  For Steinbeck to find this essential truth buried in one of the oldest and most commonly known stories in the western world is remarkable.  Steinbeck's insight that is so valuable because it names an essential mindset that provides enormous leverage in the battle to find your voice.  You will be better off for reading this book.   <br /> <br />I aspire to teach this novel in class someday.
B0006419J6|4.0|\\"I,Robot\\" offers interesting hypotheses about man and his relationship to his creations but ultimately this film is essentially a popcorn film with some pretensions.  If it's primarily an action film then director Alex Proyas has achieved his primary goal of entertaining the audience.  If it is a serious exploration of the nature of artificial intelligence then it suffers somewhat in comparison to films such as \\"Blade Runner\\" and \\"A.I.\\".  Will Smith continues to grow as both an actor and an action-star here.  His down-to-earth quality helps to cut through alot of the pretenses of the film.  The CGI effects are excellent here.  I feared at some point that the robot animation would overwhelm the flesh-and-blood actors on the screen.  This film is not destined to be a classic of the genre but that should not detract anyone from accepting it for what it is and have a good time.

B00005JMFQ|4.0|This movie always brings tears to my eyes. It's sometimes confusing, funny and sexy.
0767020308|5.0|Love this movie and the actors in it! The best version I have ever seen.
B00003JRCQ|5.0|'Persuasion' as a novel is flawless and to adapt it onto film, that was undoubtedly going to be a colossal task. The reason for this being that story is about love lost and the fear that it might never be able to be regained, two subjects that are difficult to portray without great acting, scenery and music. Luckily for the viewer, this adaptation of 'Persuasion' has all of that.  <br /> <br />It really resonates with you from how it just captures each character perfectly and displays how aggravating the unbearably suffocating social etiquette of Regency England truly was. This might have seemed 'romantic' and 'emotional' in some overly sentimental Hollywood period films but in this adaptation, you see how heartbreaking it is. It is a raw and unflinching portrayal of how Regency England would have been like for the debt-ridden landed gentry yet it is a subtle and almost repressed tale of the choices we make.  <br /> <br />The acting is sublime, I cannot applaud it more and other reviewers agree with me so it just can't be dissed! The music was beautiful and I loved the attention to detail that the camera gave - it just shows that the BBC weren't trying to make an adaptation that would make loads of money, they did it to fulfill what Austen wanted us to see.  <br /> <br />I can see why some enthusiasts of the novel would feel that better looking people should have played the two main characters because that is Austen describes it in the book but don't be put off! The choice of actors actually works better because it is just about pure emotion, not how fit they are in the book. <br /> <br />Last Thought: This adaptation won't be for everyone but if you just want to appreciate matters of the soul without having image or superficiality in the middle of things, don't be dissuaded - watch 'Persuasion'.
B0002YLC24|5.0|Great movie. wonderful photography and acting. I would love to know the song played in the background during the movie that went like \\"i am ready, i am ready\\" a male vocalist. Wonderful song. <br />If anyone knows the artist pls contact me on ellisnick@aol.com.Thanks
B00003CXCD|5.0|I only recently saw this film and loved every bit of it. After the movie I got a little upset that I wasn't exposed to the movie earlier in my life. <br /> <br />Audrey Hepburn is absolutely delightful. She portrays the oblivious and suffocated princess so well, that you would think she was a princess in real life. She is funny, articulate, and very witty. Oh, and that irenic smile of hers could bring peace on earth. And her eyes? Wow, perhaps the most beautiful woman of all time. (I'm aware of Helen of Troy!!) <br /> <br />Gregory Peck is equally impressive. He plays the quick-witted reporter who is in need of some photos of the princess. He too is brilliant in the film. The unusual circumstance in which they meet, practically writes itself and makes for funny, funny moments. The chemistry between Hephurn and Peck is absolutely terrific.  <br /> <br />This movie embodies all of the qualities of a good movie: It has good taste, it is entertaining, fun, emotional, and has a wonderful ending. After seeing this movie you will have a new standard for what you consider a good movie. Overall, the movie is well written, well acted, and well directed. <br /> <br />Just a terrific, must see movie for all ages!! <br /> <br />In My Humble Opinion <br />John G (Someone find me) <br />
B0002J4X1Q|3.0|Most fans of the Resident Evil videogame series were disappointed by this movie.  I'm not entirely sure why but I found it to be a solid movie which never does anything really wrong.  The special effects are good, the acting isn't bad, the dialogue isn't stupid, the story is good, and there is a fair amount of scares.  All in all, the movie is a little generic and unoriginal but nothing is done badly. <br /> <br />The story is that a secret research facility known as The Hive resides below the city of Raccoon City and someone has unleashed the deadly T-virus within the facility.  This virus amongst other things has the ability to bring the dead back as zombies, flesh eating killers which have the ability to transmit the deadly virus by biting.  A highly trained group of \\"special forces\\" type guys are sent into The Hive by the Umbrella Corporation to figure out what happen.  Nobody outside knows why facility shut itself down.  The facility is still being controlled by the master AI, which needless to say is a little bit paranoid of the current situation. <br /> <br />In conclusion, I didn't regret watching this movie and have even enjoyed rewatching it several times.  There is no deep meaning, there are no awesome twisted character revelations, there isn't humor, there are no horrendous bloodbaths, but it is a decent action/horror movie that is an okay popcorn muncher.
B000001Y42|5.0|This is by far the most hard core Limp Bizkit album.  This may be their freshman attempt, but it has the sound of an aged band.  If your considering this cd I can guarantee you will not be dissapointed.  This cd is guaranteed to rock your sox off.
B0001611DI|4.0|George Romero returns to his zombie horror series which began with Night of the Living Dead and later would be concluded with Day of the Dead.  The zombie epidemic has continued to spread and survivors are banning together.  Frightened and generally well armed groups try to combat this plague.  The apocalypse is here and for most part the \\"every man for him self rule\\" applies.  The strong rule the weak and civilized society has officially collapsed.  Romero directs this sequel with a similar style.  There of course are moments of gore and running away from zombies, but the focus of the movie is the character development and their interaction with each other and other groups of survivors.  Where Romero stirs things up a bit in this one is by making it compensate for the lack of \\"action\\" by making the characters a little bit well sort of funny and sometimes crazy. <br /> <br />The basic setting for this one is a group of survivors that have holed up in a shopping mall.  Unfortunately the zombies are drawn to the shopping mall based on a primal memory of their former lives and the places they used to spend there time.  Other bans of survivors are also drawn to the mall as well, some for good and some for not. <br /> <br />The original Night of the Living Dead had the characters wound up really tight and worried, in this movie the characters seem to have had time to learn to cope with their situation and thus try to enjoy them selves every now and then.  The movie also goes into the long term stress that this sort of a situation can cause.  There are moments were the characters display the fact that they really are at any time on the breaking point of the line between sanity and insanity.  Aside from a few scenes that are too goofy this movie is great and a true classic.
B00006LIRI|5.0|\\"The Best Of 1990-2000\\" is a great CD for anyone who just wants a taste of what U2 did in the 90's and it still has something new for the hardcore fan. It's a collage of some of the group's most memorable recordings and remixes of what some have considered songs that had promise but didn't fully deliver to their potential. After \\"The Joshua Tree\\" and \\"Rattle And Hum,\\" albums that mostly explored American music like blues and gospel to stunning effect, U2 played around with flavors more akin to what's popular in the European clubs. Never losing their sense of rock n' roll, the band began experimenting with techno dance beats, a little rap, a lot of experimentation. Few artists have been able to radically change their image and remain intact, U2 did it because the spirit, the essence of their ideas and messages was never lost under all the gloss. This collection features the hits of the era like the sultry, funk-driven \\"Mysterious Ways,\\" the epic, soaring \\"Until The End Of The World\\" with it's visions of heartbreak and spirituality framed by The Edge's rich, ripping guitar work. \\"One\\" is still a beautiful song, a gem that never feels aged. \\"Miss Sarajevo\\" and \\"Stay (Faraway, So Close!)\\" are examples of how U2 can hypnotize a listener with the most evocative chords and words. \\"Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me, Kill Me\\" is a feverish, almost glam-rock tune that is always thrilling. The newer material like \\"Beautiful Day\\" still shines with it's sense of pure heart and soul. U2 fanatics who already own every album will probably pick this one up for the new songs and remixes. \\"Electrical Storm\\" is a dreamy, rockin' song that was a peek at what would come with \\"How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb.\\" \\"The Hands That Built America,\\" recorded for Martin Scorsese's \\"Gangs Of New York\\" movie, is a powerful, operatic piece. The remixes are exciting and intriguing. \\"Gone,\\" now laced with new guitars and an added Edge vocal, really comes alive with ferocious energy. \\"Discotheque\\" now feels like pure rock n' roll you can dance to, if the original felt too clubbish, this one is more stripped and feels more accessible. U2 is one of those rare bands that delivers a real deal, we get classic songs remastered to a sound superior to the orignal releases and new material that makes this a plausible purchase. \\"The Best Of 1990-2000\\" is an example of U2 at their best, for the casual listener this may prove to be the beginning of going out and checking out the band's entire catalogue.
B0001Z52RU|4.0|When I first found out Ashton Kutcher (Kelso in That 70s Show) was going to star in a serious intelligent horror movie as the sober main character I was just a little bit skeptical.  Then the movie hit the theaters and the critics hated it, now I'd become that much more skeptical.  However, despite all that I was intrigued by the premise of the movie and after about half a dozen other crappy recent horror movies I figured I didn't have anything to lose.  Let me state that this was by far one of the best psychological horror movies I've seen in a very long time.  Ashton Kutcher did a fantastic job. <br /> <br />The premise for this movie is that Ashton's character has the ability to remember important events in his life and has the ability to return to the events in his life and change them.  Needless to say, once he starts it gets pretty crazy.  Any physicist will tell you that alterting past events could result in very drastic changes/consequences.  The whole cause and effect formula is put to good use in this movie.  Everytime Ashton plays around with things it always seems to turn out that much worse for him in the future. <br /> <br />I love this movie for the amazing plot twists and reveletions that are thrown at you in abundance.  Throughout the entire movie you feel like you're constantly being inundated with fresh new content.  Never for a moment did I feel bored, nor could I ever successfully predict some of the outcomes. <br /> <br />The usual acclaim goes towards this movie, great plot, good special effects, fantastic acting jobs, solid dialogue, etc.  Don't get me wrong people, this is a very twisted and disturbing movie.  Prepare to be shocked and utter the praise, \\"What the hell?\\" a lot.  I'd recommend for those out there who haven't seen this movie to watch the director's cut version first and then the theatrical version.  That is what I did and it really made me appreciate the true theme that the director was trying to convey.  I won't say which ending is better, but it is worth to watch them both.
1592400876|4.0|Let me start by saying that I do not blame Ms. Truss or her book for my lack of friends.  However, I must warn anyone interested in this book: take a long hard look at what you've become.  Is it really worth sacrificing meaningful relationships with real people just be right?  If your answer is, \\"yes\\", than this book is right up your irreparably pedantic alley.  While the differences between American ad British usage is never really addressed nor explained, it is still a deligtful account of one stickler's struggle through a world that prefers speedy convenience to grammatical beauty.
0808514121|5.0|In \\"East of Eden,\\" Steinbeck catches the subtlety of life that consistently eludes us. Steinbeck constructs unique and brittle characters out of thread--each with its own particular color--and seamlessly weaves them into a beautiful fabric of experience and life. The exhibits of fear and joy draw the reader in simply because the reader is reading about himself. The character Lee--commenting on Genesis--says that a reader only enjoys a story in as much as they see themselves in it, and the ultimate story is one that everyone experiences as their own. Steinbeck strived to create such a story, and \\"East of Eden\\" is the result.<br /><br />The parallels to Genesis are not as blatant as one would suspect. The 600-page novel breezes by and a majority of it can be spent forgetting its metaphorical nature. Steinbeck masterly navigates the storyline through straits of drama, introspective commentary, philosophy, theology, and simple beauty. Many of the conclusions are figurative and implied, and much of the meaning is in what is not said rather than what is. It is only when Steinbeck has let you forget the story he mimics, that he will quickly remind you, giving you an entire new context to contemplate.<br /><br />The novel is dark at times. Every character is severely flawed, and Steinbeck is relentless in his portrayal of weakness, vulnerability, and sorrow. Yet, every character is dripping with realism and humanity; the result is a depth and beauty to the characters that is rarely experienced. Every character is so real it feels as if you could get up, walk next door, and talk to them as an old acquaintence.<br /><br />The novel imitates the Genesis story in an American setting, but \\"East of Eden\\" is simultaneously a commentary and reinterpretation of the same story. It ignores the plot specifics, morals, and instead grasps the essence, the heart, that makes the myth timeless and applicable to anyone with a beating heart. \\"East of Eden\\" is more than a biblical metaphor, more than good and evil; it's the story of the birth of man: the marriage of good and evil, and their residual struggle within man. Ultimately, it's the celabration of the free will that makes us human, and the simple joy of existence.<br /><br />This is a beautiful peace of literature. The writing is simplistic and a pleasure to read. Steinbeck's narration is well-crafted, and the plot trods along at a lofty and steady pace.  Definitely the best piece of fiction I have read in a long, long time.it's the story of the birth of man: the marriage of good and evil, and their residual struggle within man.

B00002EPJH|5.0|I spend most of my listening time with classical music (piano, above all), but absolutely love Jarrett's jazz work (as well as his classical recordings). This is intimate, highly musical playing. Like a lot of our best talent, Jarrett seems to have found a more appreciative audience in Europe, where I too first heard him. Thankfully the folks across the water know a good thing when they hear it. Hopefully you will too! This is the kind of playing George Winston et al. want to do when they grow up.

While there are moments of tension and the chance of seeing a horse hurt-it does'nt happen, and<br /><br />Spirit Wins in a Big Way.<br /><br />  However, if you want an exact soundtrack re-production, do not use the 'listen to' cuts as they are not in the proper order.<br /><br />The reviews of the songs are also not in order.

B0006HXXBA|5.0|Well if anyone is expecting Enemy of God to be similar to the Endless Pain/Pleasure to Kill/Terrible Certainty ones, be prepared to be disappointed. I'm really glad its not, cuz those albums are fast and furious, no doubt, but without any substance & any memorable riffs. Anyway back to this masterpeice... this one is pretty similar to Violent Revolution, in that both are mid-paced thrash with a lot of melody incorporated. Also throw in a wee bit of the endorama style, and we get the post-endorama albums. The best songs are Impossible Brutality, and Ancient Plague.     Well one more thing, I wanna know what the hell the previous reviewer's been smoking, Kreator has never had a female member anytime.
B0002Y69NQ|5.0|I agree with the previous posts - this is definitely worth getting, but ... <br />I got the limited edition set and the DVDs are mounted in individual trays (nice) but they: 1) use CD-style hubs and 2) the hubs are tight enough that its difficult to gently remove the DVD. <br />I was under the impression that for long life, DVDs were supposed to be mounted with special hubs that don't have a vise-grip on the disc and allow the disc to spin freely.
B0006IJ5PW|5.0|It's a Friday night in September, 1988. The stores are all closed. The streets are quiet. Everyone in Odessa, Texas, has gathered to worship. But not at church. Rather, they've congregated at the local high school's football field where 20,000 screaming fans chant \\"MO-JO\\" in support of their beloved Permian Panthers, a team expected to roll across the Lone Star State like a tumbleweed in a stiff wind on its way to the state championship. Anything less would be considered a tragic disappointment. But when something tragic happends, will there state championship dreams go down the drain? Find out for yourself by watching it! I went and saw this movie when it was in the theater, boy was that loud! But I loved the great football noise! Enjoy!=)

The passion in Cigala's voice and the beauty of the piano as played by Bebo make for an amazing mix of music and cultures. <br /> <br />Not that this is a depressing CD, but it's perfect on a rainy day, looking out the window with a glass of red wine.....I know, I know, it sounds cheesy but it's true! <br /> <br />HIGHLY recommended.
6300270696|4.0|I love Ladyhawke not only as a movie, but also because it gets my imagination going. Images and symbols are gateways to the imagination and this movie is filled with them. Watching it, made me think of possibilities for my own writing and encouraged me not to be shy about going to places in the writing of my new book that I sometimes feel shy about going. Wow, I think, this worked so well in the movie, I can do that in my writing, too. For example, the power of the wolf and the flight of the hawk and their always just missing each other were great expressions of love and longing and the power of passion. I also like the delving into the darkness of the human soul as in the character of the bishop. Great archetypical evil character. Speaking of archetypes, Matthew Broderick is a terrific court jester. And here's an idea... whenever I watch this movie, I think it would be so interesting to write a story from the point of view of the bishop and show in a story how he came to make the pact with the devil or darkside that allows him to set the curse or enchantment on the lovers.It's an idea free for the taking!
B00005JNBQ|5.0|I wasn't sure what to expect when I put this DVD in the player. In the first 15 minutes I was expecting the typical comedy to script itself out. After about 20 minutes I realized that I was watching a movie about nothing, and that it was all about the characters, and the story was only about the way things happened in this place at this time. There was no plot, no story, no revelations...it was just about the people. And the people were people that I knew. People that everybody knows and people that everybody is. We knew these people and the recollection either makes us happy or makes us cringe because we remember how we reacted to them...Gosh.<br />While the script probably shouldn't be given Oscar consideration, it is too bad that the actors won't be. There should be nominations here for lead actor and at least 2 supporting, but that ain't gonna happen. It's really sad. Because &quot;Napoleon Dynamite&quot; wasn't a mainstream movie, the performances here will be ignored for others of lesser merit.
1400049628|2.0|At some point, a one-note parody becomes the very thing an author is attempting to skewer.  I'm certain Max Brooks intended this to be a tongue-in-cheek parody of Y2K and 1980s-era survival manuals, but I challenge the reader to draw the distinction between Brooks' work and those oh-so-very-serious guides for surviving catastrophe.  In contrast, see the Robin Williams/Walther Matthau/Michael Leeson movie \\"The Survivors\\".  Perhaps Brooks' vision would be better realized on film as well. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, this book fails as either humor or horror.  On the positive side, I now have a fairly definitive, although sometimes contradictory, zombie outbreak survival manual in my library in case one is needed. <br />

B00005JNEI|4.0|OK, maybe Moore's ideas and concepts are a bit fanatical. But he also shows that there a lot of things  very wrong with the US and the little president. I fail to understand why nobody realises that this petty war is bringing the Great Fall for the US. The country has so much potential, but the US along with Higher-Than-God President is just flushing it down the john. Everybody thinks being patriotic means being loyal to a nation and fighting for it. But what about being loyal to Humanity? Is it really logical to fight massacre our own kind or any kind for that matter? Isaac Asimov in his Foundation classic said \\"Violence is the last resource of the incompetent.\\" I agree totally. one shouldn't take this movie to seriously but one should really think about the president ones voting for next time. <br /> <br />

B000003TA4|4.0|Nevermind is by far Nirvana's best album, almost up the top with some of the ultra classic rock albums. Kurt Cobain's rasping vocals melt the listener's face off, while Dave Grohl and Krist Novoselic back him up with awesome riffs and solos on the drums and bass. This album introduced Smells Like Teen Spirit, the best rock song EVER. <br /> <br />1. Smells like Teen Spirit: Need I say more? 10/10 <br /> <br />2. In Bloom: A powerful, heavy track that follows up well to the first track. 9/10 <br /> <br />3. Come as You Are: Another hit, the famous bass line at the beginning is unforgettable. 9/10 <br /> <br />4. Breed: A shame it wasn't on the greatest hits album, but the verses are nothing compared to the chorus. 8/10 <br /> <br />5. Lithium: Brilliant song which builds up to the heavier climax. 9/10 <br /> <br />6. Polly: Depressing but brilliant song, depicting the real life kidnapping of Polly Klass, who gained the attacker's trust and escaped him. 9/10 <br /> <br />7. Territorial Pissing: This is one helluva crazy song, Kurt Cobain's voice breaks at the end as he screams his head off. 8/10 <br /> <br />8. Drain You: Good song that goes all freaky in the middle and then goes heavy again. 8/10 <br /> <br />9. Lounge Act: The bass line, like Come As You Are, is good but it gets boring after a while. 7/10 <br /> <br />10. Stay Away: The worst song on the album, it really lacks compared to some of the other tracks. 6/10 <br /> <br />11. On A Plain: A great song which gives the album a bit of a kick after the bad previous tracks. 8/10 <br /> <br />12. Something in the Way: Quiet, miserable, boring song that waits about 20 minutes before it turns into a secret track which is also kind of rubbish. 4/10 <br /> <br />The songs are excellent up to Lounge Act. It is definitely a brilliant album for Nirvana fans but some people may be disappointed. I thought it was great and i would recommend it to anyone.

B0002IU988|4.0|One thing this record has over previous Creed stuff is great  material from beginning to end.  Not just a few great tunes   and the rest being okay.  I think it's better song writing.  They don't waste any time either.  The opening track is the   best to me.  It just ROCKS!  Vocally Myles does a decent job.    But If your a Creed fan you can't help but wonder what this   material might sound like with Scott.  Don't let that stop you!  This is still a great CD.  Then again with Scott in front  the music and the edge that it has may not be the same.  I guess we will never know?

0783226837|5.0|Do you remember in the 70's and 80's those local UHF Ghost Host shows that would come on every Saturday night around Midnight? Elvira is the most famous I guess, but here in the Baltimore area we had Count Gore DeVol on channel 20, or the Ghost Host on channel 45. Every week you would be treated to great schlock like \\"Teenagers from Outer Space\\" or \\"Attack of the Killer Shrews\\", and as I kid, I loved popping a big old bowl of popcorn and staying up into the wee hours watching these movies. Sadly, the days of the indy UHF stations are gone, and the Ghost Hosts are a thing of the past...but if they were still around, you can be sure \\"Tremors\\" would be in heavy rotation. This movie is just so much fun with a perfect blend of humor, action, and several pretty tense moments. Sure, \\"Tremors\\" screams B-MOVIE...and that is what is so great about it. \\"Tremors\\" doesn't take itself too seriously...and neither should you. The movie unfolds and it's a fun little ride, one that should be taken when the moon is out, when everyone else is in bed....and with a big old bowl of popcorn planted in your lap.

B0002OERI0|5.0|They pulled it off!! Despite the naysayers! An album written in the midst of a political crisis, a fragmented fan base and declining sales is actually a friggin' Masterpiece. The first single, American Idiot is only the tip of the iceberg. There are several gems here like the fantastically complex Jesus Of Suburbia, the pounding Holiday, the sing-along friendly Boulevard Of Broken Dreams, the punky-as-hell St. Jimmy, the gorgeous Wake Me Up When September Ends, the amazing rhythm of Whatsername... where do I stop? Every song here is a pleasure to listen to. You know, I always considered Green Day as a somewhat guilty pleasure, maybe because of their slightly kiddish image. No more. This album is a classic!
B00005IBGQ|5.0|The most pleasantly musical album I've heard in a very long time.  As far as musical pleasure is concerned, I'd say he's generating the same placid, relaxed, serene, enjoyable feelings as Norah Jones, but I think his music is better.  Like rowing a slow boat down a river.  Of course, I just got his cd, so I may be biased.  I haven't heard his others yet, and I hope they are as pleasurable!!!
0142004235|5.0|How does one write a review about \\"The East of Eden?\\" <br />It is so full of beauty that the words are still absorbing <br />inside of me-- <br />Steinbeck is a master storyteller--and this book follows three generations of families and the choices they make in life, how each choice affects the next choice. <br /> <br />I adore how Steinbeck will throw universal messages in for the reader--deep directives about religion, racism, and most of all---how the choices we make in life NOW can be our down-fall in the end. <br /> <br />\\"East of Eden\\" is perfection--with its language, images, universality, humour, and profound intellegence.  <br /> <br />I will not go into the characters--because one must read the enire book to get the entire essence--and you will not be the same afterwards. (But I will say \\"The Chinese Servant\\")  is used by Steinbeck as a sort of wisdom, guru, conscience. He is superb. <br /> <br />\\"East of Eden\\" would not be the book it is without \\"Redemption\\" <br />and wouldn't you know it-- Steinbeck throws that in too! <br /> <br />*****This book will live forever***** Perfection.
0812550706|5.0|Ender's Game, by Orson Scott Card, is the story of a six-year old boy named Andrew Wiggin, also known as Ender.  The military needs Ender's abnormal genius to command an army to protect the planet from destruction.  However, the military wants for Ender \\"a delicate balance...enough so isolation makes him creative.  At the same time, he has to keep a strong ability to lead.\\"  The military decides to isolate him, control his life, and give him new and harder challenges, to the point that Ender's life is at risk.  Ender is pushed to his limits time and time again until the final battle with the forces that threaten to destroy humanity.  Ender grows quickly from a talented six-year old to an officer.   Ender learns that \\"no one has control over his or her own life, so they have to fulfill the roles given by people who care about them.\\"  Ender's Game has subjects and level in complexity, from death, war, sibling rivalry, the lust for power, and most importantly, the core limits every human has.  This enthralling book contains surprises this review is not going to spoil.  The characters are vivid; Card paints a portrait of a character then brings that character to life.    Foreshadowing is one of the most powerful elements of Ender's Game, but those powerful clues predict the plot chapters before it happens to the character, in such a way that thinkers and careful readers know what happens before it occurs.  The human emotions and the lessons learned stay concealed regardless, so people need to deeply analyze the characters to understand the big picture, like Ender's intelligence progression, where his future challenges are known ahead of time, but Ender's reactions to them and his maturing are not known until later.     Ender's Game is a book for all ages; kids enjoy the plot while mature readers will love analyzing the real importance of people and events.  This saga is quite dynamic, and all the characters are well developed; some, not just Ender, go through radical changes from where the book started until it ended.  This book is a must in everyone's literary library, so buy it now!   After reading Ender's Game, read Ender's Shadow, a parallel novel to Ender's Game, and Speaker for the Dead, a sequel to Ender's Game, both wonderful and original in their own right.  Unlike Ender, Card was not playing a game when he created Ender's Game.  This book is the one that defines Card as one the best science-fiction writers of our time.        Sam

B00005JNLY|3.0|\\"Spanglish\\" is told through the eyes of Christine (Bruce), a Mexican girl who comes to America with her mother Flor (Vega).  Flor resists Americanization as much as she can, but when taking a job as a housekeeper for the Claskys, she realizes that that is easier said than done.  The Claskys are a well to do family headed by renowned chef John (Sandler).  He is the \\"good\\" parent and a all around nice guy.  His wife, Deborah (Leoni) is out of work not a very pleasant person.  Her relationships with her husband and daughter are strained.  Flor's insertion into the family mix causes changes in everyone, mostly for the better.  Soon, Flor and her daughter are moving into a summer home with the Claskys, and cultures begin to seriously clash. <br /> <br />\\"Spanglish\\" does not really have a plot so much as it examines a period of the characters' lives.  Since it is told through Christine's eyes, there is not as much resolution as many may like.  Instead, the story is strong on character, developing the three primary characters fully. <br /> <br />Adam Sandler gives another solid dramatic performance (his first was the offbeat \\"Punch Drunk Love\\").  He is the nice guy, and is easy to like.  You feel for the guy as he has his ups and downs, and genuinely want him to succees.  Ta Leoni brings believability to the bitchy wife.  Self centered and oblivious to other's feelings, Deborah is a character that you do not want to like.  Cloris Leachman brings some comic relief as Deborah's mother.  Finally Paz Vega does a solid job as the woman caught between cultures, struggling to do what is right for herself and her daughter. <br /> <br />Despite the good performances, \\"Spanglish\\" felt like a bit of a misfire to me.  I wanted more than I got out of it.  Perhaps it was the unlikeability of some characters or the lack of a real plot, I do not know.  In the days since I saw the movie, I have softened my review some, but I still can only recommend this on DVD.
0316172324|1.0|Well, I rushed out to buy Blink and after the first 20 pages or so, I realized that this book was not worth the money. The Tipping Point was an interesting book, but in this boring and silly volume the author tries to analyze all sorts of topics without the credentials to do so. The reader is left with information that seems upsupported and in some cases outdated. Moreover, the book needs a good editor. Even some of the basics of English have been overlooked. For example, the author mixes a singular object with a plural subject in this sentence, \\"we need the ability to know our own mind.\\" There are a number of examples of this throughout the book and it made me think that the author and the editor rushed to get this book published. What a disservice to readers and what a shame. You know one would think if the author is so good at examining the mind, he would be as good at catching first-grade grammatical errors.

B00005JKG9|5.0|David Mamet's GLENGARRY GLEN ROSS is, in many ways, a DEATH OF A SALESMAN for today. Like Miller's classic theater drama, it shows the American Dream gone wrong as it follows (real-estate) salespeople and their desperate attempt to make an honest buck. It is a marvelous play, and frankly better than DEATH OF A SALESMAN. Certainly, it is nowhere near as sentimental or preachy as SALESMAN occasionally was. Mamet achieves a kind of \\"poetry of the commonplace\\" with his fresh, witty, and sometimes painfully reverberant dialogue. The dialogue, as well as the compelling characterizations, ensure that GLENGARRY GLEN ROSS rises above its 1980s origins and becomes something more timeless and universal: a devastating portrait of desperation and broken dreams, set in a self-contained universe in which the name of the game is, really, just to make enough money to get by...even if it means lying, cheating, and even stealing.    James Foley's film version is a successful screen adaptation because Foley trusts Mamet's great dialogue to speak for itself. Thus, Foley admirably does not attempt visual glitz to try to \\"cinematize\\" the material; he just lets the actors deliver their lines, and he and his editor Howard E. Smith do a smooth job of retaining the rhythms of the dialogue. The result may still feel a little stagebound, but Mamet's characters and themes by themselves rise above the film's occasional staginess.    And what a cast! I can't really see a dud performance in any of the major roles here. For me, the standout here is the late Jack Lemmon, who excels in what is probably the most important character of the movie. Indeed, it is Shelley \\"the Machine\\" Levene who is probably the most potent representation of the shattered dreams that is at the heart of Mamet's play: once a real-estate big shot, he is now a desperate, blubbering mess who is now simply trying to make ends meet in his life. It is that sad desperation that Lemmon captures so vividly and movingly in his performance, and it is truly heartbreaking what eventually happens to the character in the course of the film. The rest of the performers are no less accomplished. Alec Baldwin turns his brief cameo role---written expressly for the movie by Mamet---into a brief but intense tour-de-force (one that perhaps anticipates his later performance in 2003's THE COOLER). Kevin Spacey's John Williamson starts out the movie as a model of rigidity, but then, at the very end, he acquires a subtle dimension that suggests something more cruel and evil at the heart of this otherwise-unexceptional man; Spacey does an equally subtle, terrific job of conveying both sides of this fascinating character. And perhaps one should give James Foley extra points for getting Al Pacino to restrain himself as Ricky Roma, the newest hot shot in the film's real-estate firm. I recently saw Pacino in ANGELS IN AMERICA---at least, Part I of the HBO miniseries, anyway---and found his portrayal of Roy Cohn to be an extremely mannered, inappropriately scenery-chewing performance that threw me out of the movie whenever he appeared. That bizarre delivery of his---in which strange words are elongated, while others are shortened---is thankfully nowhere in evidence in GLENGARRY GLEN ROSS, and Pacino brings an additional energy and cockiness to the role that suits his character perfectly. Frankly, I just found it a relief to see a Pacino performance that recalled his great acting triumphs during the 1970s instead of the kind of hamminess that won him the Oscar in 1993.    GLENGARRY GLEN ROSS is a powerful film about the American Dream gone sour. Highly recommended.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|This movie is one of my favorites of 2004 and all-time, despite my having low expectations before watching it. <br /> Even a levelheaded viewer who didn't enjoy this film would have trouble claiming that it was \\"flawed.\\" The execution is pretty much perfect -- there are no throwaway lines, all of the loose ends in the plot tie back to each other, and every character has a genuinely satisfying arc. Despite the surreal nature of these characters and the world they live in, I really did care about their fate and was touched by the ways in which their lives unfolded. In any movie, let alone a comedy of this nature, that is a tremendous accomplishment. <br /> The problem is, though, that some people simply will not want to watch these characters for two hours. They are very strange and awkward, and while I myself found all of them except for villain Uncle Rico to be likable, it's understandable that some folks might be left scratching their heads and wondering what the fuss is about. <br /> With that disclaimer, I will move on to the movie's rating. This is one of very few PG movies I have ever seen that is worth watching. Usually, if you see \\"PG\\" on a box, you can expect braindead kiddie films that will harm young viewers more than any nudity or violence ever could. This, though, was immensely creative, intelligent, and funny. If you're a parent concerned about content, but also want your child to develop a respectable sense of humor, this should be the first disc you drop into your DVD player for the little ones. <br /> One last note for those who liked the movie but might be on the fence about buying it: the actual DVD is a great purchase loaded with extras. With commentary, the original short film that the feature is based on, deleted scenes, and both widescreen and full screen versions, you are getting your money's worth. <br />
B00028HBKM|1.0|In a discussion I had with a friend about this movie, I complained that there didn't seem to be much to ground the suffering of Jesus in any kind of philosophy or lifestyle or teachings, something that would make the suffering be of interest. The suffering seemed kind of pointless to me, without the religious philosophy behind it. But the friend argued that the teachings of Jesus didn't matter at all, the only thing that mattered was the suffering Jesus endured while being crucified. Well, maybe that explains why Mel Gibson and American fundamentalists are lock-step on this story. It's a Passion Play without any passion, without any story and without any depth - it stays right at the surface, which is, I guess, where the director believes it belongs. This is literally a movie that is skin-deep - especially if you mean flayed skin, and HEEPS OF BLOOD. A bad movie not because it's shocking but because it's shallow and, despite the blood, it is terribly dull and terribly thin.
B000669GAI|5.0|This is an awesome collection of Pearl Jam's greatest stuff.  While I love PJ, I sometimes struggle with which disc to bring as I'm running out the door.  They all have a few of my favorite songs.  This 2 disc set has many of the songs that don't exist in one place.  This would also be an excellent addition for someone who does not really know all of the albums but is eager to get a taste of some of the great music from various periods in Pearl Jam's music.
B00005JLPK|1.0|With the exception of the opening credits, this has to be one of the WORST films ever made. Where to begin? I thought that this was going to be an interesting biopic judging from the reviews at the time it originally came out. Having seen the dvd however (and forcing myself to watch it to conclusion), I can tell you I hardly know anything about this woman's art - ostensibly the reason why the film was made to begin with. I hate that the audience is manipulated to feel that Frida, was a woman of passion! Who felt things deeply! Don't YOU feel it, viewer? Oh, the drama! Oh, I beat my breast as a sign of solidarity!! Of feeling!! Ohh ohhh ohh!!! Oh, Frida! You were such a passionate artist!! Ohhh!!! Your life was a celebration!! Oh!!! Your pain!! Your life!!!! WHAT RUBBISH! And I did NOT buy AT ALL, her attraction to Alfred Molina's character. What? Were all the men in her town GAY? Was he really the best catch around? I think this entire film is a complete waste. One or two of the songs stick in the mind, but this production is a joke. I didn't buy into it on any level. Salma Hayek tried TOO HARD with this film. She owes everyone who paid to see this in a theatre or on dvd a refund.
0385334206|5.0|This was an odd book. The author introduces himself as a character in his book about 2/3 of the way through and gives away the ending to his own story. Bizarre to say the least, and at first glance, I was inclined to think of it as a cheap narrative device, particularly after reading Cat's Cradle, which was a fantastic story. However, I came to realise that the author *was* a part of the story, offering his views and emotions on subjects as widely-varying as American intervention in wars overseas (he might as well have been writing about Iraq), death of family members, insanity, one's mortality, sex. And so on. The author is himself a part of the story with much to add on these topics, but he relegates himself to a secondary role behind Kilgore Trout and Dwayne Hoover. <br /> <br />The most notable character to me, though, was Zog, the farting and tap dancing space alien. WTF? <br />
0688163173|4.0|I enjoyed Shutter Island ~~ it was a quick read.  I read it because I enjoyed Mystic River so much and found it to be a much different style of storytelling.  By the middle of the book, I could not wait to see how it was going to end.  The ending is very, very different then I expected and I still have some questions and loose ends I'd like to have answered.  I did enjoy Mystic River a lot more, but I really do feel Shutter Island would make a very good and suspensful movie (that way I could see if the ending is as I thought it was).  A good read for the mystery buffs.
B00004TDTO|5.0|The movie that spawned the term \\"blockbuster\\"! Bruce the Shark continues to thrill after a quarter century. Who can forget the opening, with John Williams' chilling score (which generations still hum at grim moments in life), the immortal lines \\"we're gonna need a bigger boat,\\" Roy Scheider, Richard Dreyfuss and Robert Shaw singing despite being scared to death, Robert Shaw's immortal monologue about the sinking of the Indianapolis (which inspired a young viewer to try to get a pardon for the Indianapolis' scapegoat captain)....the gore, the great moment when Brody blasts the beast to kingdom come. If you remember being ten and afraid to take a bath (yeah, fruity admits it) then this great collection, with its added attractions, isn't one to miss.
B0002234LS|4.0|Johnny Depp is a brilliant actor.  Whether over-the-top funny in Pirates of the Caribbean and Ed Wood, or more understated like in this film or Edward Scissorhands, Depp adds a balanced believability to the characters he portrays that makes them leap from the screen in full 3-D.  The supporting cast is solid but unspectacular, so it is Depp who really shines here.    The film stays very close to the short story in most respects.  After watching the film, I re-read the story (in Stephen King's Four Past Midnight collection) and found large sections of dialogue translated directly into the screenplay.  There are some subtle plot variances between the screenplay and the story, but the influence of King's storyline is very evident in the screenplay.  Ironically, the part that deviates the most from King's story is the ending--(\\"I want you to fix the ending, Mr. Rainey.\\")  All things considered, however, this is a very faithful adaptation of a lesser known King work that does not lose the macabre devilishness of King's writing in translation to the screen.    The only thing with which I found fault was the initial pacing of the film.  Part of the slow pace is intentional--setting up Mort's slothful state of existence is key to the story--but after 20 minutes or so, it begins to wear a bit thin and the viewer may wind up wondering whether this is really going to go anywhere.  It eventually does go somewhere, but it takes a bit of patience for the plot elements to gel and garner any serious viewer interest.  Stick around for the ride, however, and you'll be glad that you peered through this secret window and spied Depp's performance.
B00005JNBQ|1.0|have you ever been to a comedy club and watch a really really horrible stand up?  and i mean really horrible.   thats what this movie is.  it has no plot so it relys on jokes to make up for the movie...sadly every single (and i mean every single JOKE) attempt for laughs fails miserably.  blockbuster shouldnt even put this movie in the comedy section..it should be in the horror section, because this movie is horror-ble
B00005JMFQ|5.0|I didn't know if I would like this movie, so I rented it first.  And I was very surprised at how cute and heart-warming the movie was. It is very funny in many parts.  The movie follows several story lines and then comes all together at the end.  After renting this movie, I asked for it for Christmas.  This is a great movie about love and relationships.  I highly recommend this movie to people who like romantic comedies!
0316172324|4.0|Most of the best-selling business books are used to offer readers with different tactics on how to make decision on the basis of detailed information and rational thinking. Any decision that is made within a flurry of moment may easily lead to inadvertent slip or more seriously, disastrous consequence.<br /><br />Contrary to other magnum opus pertaining to the subject of decision making, Malcom Gladwell suggests that adaptive unconscious is a powerful decision-making apparatus that is different with the conscious strategy and it is capable of making quick judgements based on scanty information. It does an excellent job of judging people, setting goals, developing new products and initiating action under stressful conditions. The decision quality is as good as decisions made in months of rational analysis. According to him, the ability to use adaptive unconscious can be educated and controlled.<br /><br />This book provides readers with full understanding of the power of adpotive unconscious. It is incontrovertible that we are now living in the business world which is more uncertain and turbulent than what we encountered during the last century. Gladwell guides readers to understand something in the first two seconds of looking in a sophisticated and efficient manner.
0064407667|5.0|When my kids told me how much of a depressing book this was, I thought to myself,\\"Why read such a depressing book?\\"   I was pleasantly surprised how darkly funny Lemony Snicket really is.  It was some of the funniest unfortunate events that I somehow enjoyed reading.  Count Olaf, you are so dispicable!!!  I really enjoyed how the author continuously uses 'big' words and then explains to the reader how he just used the word and gives a definition and how the kids in the book usually say, \\"I know what that means!\\"  Quite funny, if you like that kind of humor.  I liked it and my kids like and they are harmless.  This one was so good, I read the next one.
B0002VEPRQ|5.0|Still a classic after all these years, and a monument to Julie Andrews' splendid voice. Mary Poppins has stood the test of time, with generation after generation enjoying it as much as the previous one and the songs such as \\"A Spoonful of Sugar\\" are timeless treasures that live on longer than anything that will ever appear on the Top 40. Buy one for yourself, one for your kids, and one for the grandkids. A must-have for any film fan.

B000000H57|4.0|Pete Steele has even admitted that it's their most commercial album, and that they had so much money from the sales of Bloody Kisses, they used most of it to make this album sound as good as it does. The intro to this album is mostly a waste of a song/track/time, as it's a minute of nothing basically. But the first song on this album is very catchy. Love You To Death is a stand out track on this album. Be My Druidess, Green Man, Red Water (Christmas Mourning), My Girlfriends Girlfriend, In Praise of Bacchus and Cinnamon Girl (Which is a cover song) are all wonderfully written and extremely easy to listen to, and also very catchy in the typical Type O way. <br /> <br />Type O are a band for everyone. Pretty much everyone can get something out of listening to Type O. I would say this is easily their most commercial album, which in saying that isn't bad at all. It made them more well-known, and gave them a larger fan base. I urge anyone interested in them to check this out, probably first, and see what you think. If you want catchyness, anthemic atmosphere, and well written songs, i doubt you'll be disappointed.
B00004RFCM|2.0|I would rather collect toe lint and put it into a small purple box than ever watch another episode of Sex and the City. The ladies are pretty though. This is NOT for us... Males in their 20's. It's for lonely chicks.
B00005LC1H|5.0|Where have you been hiding if you have never seen an episode of this BBC treasure trove?  Fawlty Towers is easily BBC's best comedy, bar none.  Filmed over two seasons (1975 and 1979), the show featured clever, witty and engaging scripts allowing for plenty of re-watch factor.  A stellar cast included John Cleese and Prunella Scales.  It is very difficult to pick a favourite scene, but safe to say that are all outstanding. <br /> <br />This is a DVD you can purchase without doubt.  Picture quality is outstanding in comparison to the video version.  Yes, the price may be high, but it is worth every single penny.
0321127420|5.0|Probably the best general application architecture books out there.  The only time this book gets specific to a proprietary technology is in the examples only because martin wants to show you a real world example of what he is talking about.

0345350472|5.0|Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep is an excellent introduction into the sci-fiction/philosophical masterworks* (*emphasis on master - Dick is a noted literary genius) of Philip K. Dick because this is one of his best works and also most of you have seen a very close adaptation of this book, a film called Blade Runner, which unfortunately was released to box office failure shortly after K. Dick's death, only later to become a cult classic that no one has missed from their DVD collection.<br /><br />Dick's books must be viewed along with writer's ambitions and warnings. In 1968 Dick wrote this story a year before man landed on the moon and yet describes a world somewhere closer to our own, in a `very soon down the road' roundabout way, as Dick does in all his books. Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep is no different, describing an environmental catastrophic event that leads to Earth's ruin, where humans have migrated to offshore colony worlds, where they get a free human cyborg - a replicant, to serve them. Back on the earth those who remain live in a world where everything is synthetic, the atmosphere radioactive, and where everyone dreams of owning a real live pet, and not a clone controlled by microchips and circuit boards, including our protagonist, Deckard, a professional bounty-hunter cop, with secret ambitions of replacing his electronic sheep with real ones before the neighbours found out how poor he is, so takes on a contract to hunt down and `retire' a group dangerous renegade replicants that escaped from the offshore world colony of Nexus 6, murdering people during the break out and who have managed to make their way to earth blending in with the local population.<br /><br />Deckard who is looking forward to buying some real sheep goes to visit the Tyrell corporation where he uses, the now unforgettable, Voigt-Kampff test, to see if a human is a cyborg. The Voigt-Kampff test is the key to opening the philosophical mindset of this book - \\"Is empathy only a human condition?\\" with the psychology that a replicant will test negative for empathy during the test. The question then arises for Deckard, \\"has he ever retired a human by mistake?\\" Dick challenges us to think about this (look at the books title) as Deckard runs across the city retiring replicants who appear to lack empathy only to suddenly find himself up against a new type of Nexus 6 that does not lack empathy and has the ability to learn it. The book will keep you second guessing as to who is real and who is not, but at its heart the question Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep in conjunction with Deckard's job, and his desire to own real sheep, leads him slowly down a path of questioning this own existence and reassessing his life and what he thought he knew. The book finished beautifully, answering these questions to the full with a bit of a revelation.<br /><br />However we would do Dick a disservice, not to at least complement the writer's ability to craft the English language, and more importantly, edit his work to perfection. This is a page turner, without any interlude or boring descriptions. Everything will be absorbed at a fine reading pace. Dick also manages to come up with about 70% dialogue, all of it beautifully written with characterisation that actually goes somewhere. The story is also very exciting!<br /><br />You will no doubt read another Dick book after finishing this one even if you do not like science-fiction. I also finished his awarding winning \\"The Man in the High Castle\\" and \\"UBIK\\". And why not? Dick is possibly the best science-fiction writer ever who does not write science-fiction. Maybe the only one that could that. I would read his whole chronicles (50+ books) just after having read this one.<br /><br />Bravo - a whole new writer with a massive collection to read.nly a human condition?\\" with the psychology that a replicant will test negative for empathy during the test.

B00004XOWM|4.0|Most people who dislike Fred Durst,tend to take it out on the music,actually that is plain stupidity.These are ratings for MUSIC,not ratings cuz you think Fred is a punk etc.I never used to care for limp bizkit,but a lot of the songs are actually deeper than \\"nookie\\".Personally I think there is some pretty good song writing on this cd.Look beyond the surface,open your mind(if that's possible).I am not one of the mass media 'sheep',or flavor of the month fan.It used to be cool to like Limp,now it's in 'style' to hate 'em,these same haters were the ones moshing in the pit to Limp 2 years ago.Go figure.Bottom line:think for yourself,give it a listen.
0440236738|5.0|I read this book mostly because I met the author years ago in an AOL writer's  chat room and we became internet buddies, exchanging emails, that sort of thing, although I haven't heard from him in several years. I started one of the Myron Bolitar stories years ago but never really became engrossed. We have never actually met in person, but now when I go to the bookstore I see a whole section of his books and see that he has become a successful author (congrats!) Since he's a \\"buddy\\" I just have to give this book five well deserved stars.    I  enjoyed the book from start to finish. Some of the plot twists seemed a little absurd but I guess that people read thrillers for plot twists and people read Thomas Mann novels for something else. I just read *The Magic Mountain* and it didn't have much in terms of plot twists. Too bad we couldn't get Mann (R.I.P.) and Coben together to write a novel . . . I bet we'd end up with something along the lines of *The Name of the Rose.*    I have two minor complaints about the novel. The first is my fault: every time the character referred to as \\"the Ghost\\" was in a scene I visualized this crazy large white head - something like the appearance of Jim Carrey in *The Mask,* but white instead of green; or else an appearance like the guy in the Jack in the Box commercials. That was awfully distracting, but then again the character was first described as having \\"skin like cataracts, milky and marshlike  . . . head shaped like a lightbulb . . . nightmare version of a Dresden doll.\\" Yikes!    The other complaint is about the character \\"Squares,\\" who is the second most important character and probably the most interesting character. Why, though, did he have to be a famous yoga guru? The character was strong enough as a street-wise dude who has a somewhat evil past and now drives around in a van trying to help street kids change their lives. The yoga guru component added nothing to the story and wasn't even believable because he hardly ever even went to that job. What gives?    Unlike *The Magic Mountain* this book moved along quickly because it kept me wondering what was going to happen next. The characters, except \\"the Ghost,\\" were well drawn, likeable, and genuine; and the main character's witty quips made the book interesting. I laughed out loud a couple of times. The main character, Will, and the female characters were particularly well done. Hooray for Harlan Coben! I hope you get a big movie deal out of one of these books.
0060987464|4.0|For anyone who's ever thought Marilyn Manson was nothing more than an attention-grabbing Satanic reverend (title bestowed by the now-dead Anton LaVey who was founder of the First Church of Satan) dipsh*t whose favourite pastime is self-administratd fellatio and badly in need of an exorcism, well this book isn't going to change a thing 'cos the same people just going to carefully copy out the damning extracts into the Black Book. Then again just as you can't trust the devil to damn himself, you can't trust Marilyn Manson to do much else than explain and defend himself and his art. Being a former journalist, you know Marilyn Manson can't go that wrong, though he elisted the help of a certain not-so-ghost writer Neil Strauss (I imagine he did the transcript of rambling). What comes across as being somewhat surprising to a former non-fan to me is that this shock-rocker does stand for something. Behind the questionable stage antics (caging people, that rumour about killing chickens) he actually does have an idea of what concept or what narrative strand of statement about herd mentality, pretence, repression or prejudice he wants to unleash upon the public. Provocative yes, but that's the way to poke people in the ribs (and remove a rib haha). Music is apparantly just a vehicle to sound the alarm. Coming from that, you can hardly believe that the guy does make pretty good music, which he does. I got repetitive neck sprain from reading this two nights in a row, which should give Christians (just the prejudiced ones) another thing to jot down in the Black Book of MM's sins.
0670033375|4.0|About 15 years ago, I was shocked to read the results of an American aerial survey of roads in remote areas of the country, which concluded that there is (in 1990) no place in the continental United States that is more than about 20 miles, as the crow flies, from the nearest road.  At Philmont Scout Ranch in the Sangre de Cristo range of the Rockies in NE New Mexico, to which many hundreds of Scouts travel each summer for an extended \\"wilderness\\" hike, the paths, directions and speeds of each of the flood of hiking parties is managed on a wall-size map in their war room, much like a flight control room of a modern airport.  The conscious purpose of the war room is to present \\"the illusion of wilderness\\" to the hikers, by preventing them from seeing that there are crowds of other hikers nearby in every direction, only hidden by a bend, a ridge, a ravine. <br /> <br />In one of Jared Diamond's earlier books, Guns, Germs and Steel, he explored the role of man's natural environment in shaping the unique nature of the human societies that emerged in different regions of the world.  It was backed by a prodigious body of research spanning anthropology, physiology, botany, archeology, animal behavior and climatology, to name only a few fields.  Although his conclusions were satisfying and plausible, the subjects were too remote in time to garner more than a smile and a nod of the head.  The paucity of detailed evidence regarding the biologic emergence of man, and man's development of agriculture, animal domestication and civilization, dooms Dr. Diamond's conclusions on those subjects to the realm of conjecture.  <br /> <br />Now we are presented with the other side of the equation: the role of man's behavior in shaping the environments in which he lives.  While Professor Diamond seems to go to great lengths to present us with a glimmer of optimism in the face of a substantial body of contrary information, the thrust of this new volume is that today, anybody's environmentalproblem is everybody's problem.  His discussions of past failed (and successful) societies serve as a sequence of progressively more complex environmental scenarios highlighting the choices-both intentional and unintentional-that determined the ultimate outcome. <br /> <br />One wonders how intelligent people in those societies that ultimately failed seemed to have made decisions that, at least in retrospect, were patently damaging to their future survival.  Diamond offers numerous examples of contemporary environmental challenges for which perfectly rational individuals and governments have made, and continue to make, decisions that are damaging to their future survival. <br /> <br />Over thirty years ago, JW Forrester, then at MIT, developed a computer simulation called World II, which modeled scores of human and environmental factors, in order to see what future the model would predict for the world.  In brief, the simulation demonstrated catastrophic population collapse between 2040 and 2060, regardless of how the values of variables and their interactions were adjusted.  The only stable simulations required that the world population be set to below its current (1970) value.  Well, we can set aside their conclusions as peculiar to their particular set of assumptions, but in Jared Diamond's current book, he concludes that each of the individual, massive environmental issues covered in his various examples will reach catastrophic crisis by about 2050, if they are not addressed promptly and in a dramatic way.  I find the correlation sobering. <br /> <br />From the standpoint purely of readable history, Collapse offers more credible conclusions about the decline of the societies it surveys than does the massive 12 volumes of Arnold Toynbee's A Study of History.  Toynbee leaned heavily on Hegelian dialectic, Diamond on compelling archeological studies and on the physical sciences.  Though a professor of geography, Diamond's formal training was in biology and physiology.  Add to that his lifelong studies in ornithology, which have contributed to his wide-ranging travels in third world countries, and it should come as no surprise that the science presented here stands up fairly well to close scrutiny. <br /> <br />This is a book that will certainly appeal to historians, environmentalists and folks who want to know what the tree-hugging fuss is all about.  For those who might be disinclined toward environmentalist assertions, this book can serve as a framework for the serious concerns that must be addressed in some fashion.
0312263120|1.0|When I see that people who see themselves as fans of a specific author give one of his book 1 or 2 star reviews, I know the book must be bad. Unfortunately, I only saw these reviews after spending the money to buy it & the time to read it.<br /><br />Firs of all, I found a few inconsistencies in the book. For what I undersand, while the Ceasar Square encoding system is certainly a nice one, but it isn't the way Julius Ceasar had encoded his messages... There are also a lot of plot inconsistencies: when Greg Hale admits to the murder of David, it obvious he would have no way of knowing the full details of David's mission and therefore - cannot be responsible for whatever happens to him. Also, the fact that the deputy director of the NSA would act unde such personal circumstances is VERY unplausible - or at least I'd like to believe that such high ranking officials care for more than impressing their impossible love interests when performing the job...<br /><br />Another plot point is something Dan Brown often falls for: too many plot twists. David's quest for the ring seemed to have just too many steps. It's as though Dan Brown feels the need to give each of his characters a certain quota of book time, and has trouble filling that quota...

B00005U122|5.0|I was lucky enough to be able to attend this tour 3 times in a 2 week period.  and even though it was the exact same concert each time, it blew me away. <br /> <br />The DVD does not dissapoint in the least.  The sound quality is excellent and the video is produced simply but wonderfully.  Often times, concert videos produced today change camera angles every couple of seconds, giving the viewer a headache.  This focuses on the correct soloists and singers and does nothing to distract from the music itself. <br /> <br />Dogs live is mind blowing, both in concert and on the DVD. <br />Water's solo material fits in very well with the classic catalog of Pink Floyd's music. <br /> <br />A pleasure to watch an icon of Water's stature on stage as often as I would like. <br />
068987474X|2.0|I echo the comments of one of the reviewers here...I wasn't that into the book.  In fact, I disliked the premise intently.  I am not one to place my faith in the way things ought to be which is what this book advocates.  Wishing and hoping etc plus $1.25 gets you a cup of coffee.  What am I to take away from this book anyway?  For the most part, the idea of leaving someone who obviously is not that into you (and is emotionally abusive) is a no brainer (but some people still need to be reminded hence the book has some value).  That is why the book gets two stars.  But please, what about the obvious opposite situation.  If the only men you should consider viable are the ones that treat you well, what about the men that get everything right and you are just not that into them? What do we do about them?  I guess women in general are so desperate for companionship and love, that we should accept it from anyone who offers.  But what if he is ugly or boring or lazy or gay (in need of a beard) or a serial killer or any myriad of other unattractive qualities other than how he treats you?  Guess what, that kind of relationship can be equally unsatisfying, but I guess Behrendt has never come across a woman that is not that into him. <br /> <br />Long story short, another book about the victimization of woman in a net of their own making.  Give the man that treats you like a human being all your power (especially your brain power) and you will live happily ever after.  Just don't give it to someone that doesn't want you.  See it's all so simple.
B0002858YS|4.0|Funny thing...with a name like The Killers, you automatically think `Must be just another heavy metal band'. Not even close! More like a hard-rocking version of Duran Duran. The good thing is this doesn't sound at all dated or nostalgic. Plus I never liked Duran but these guys are pretty good. There is a very nice blend of various keyboards with Edge like guitars. They sound like they might be British but they're actually from Las Vegas. The entire CD is solid with my favorite track being \\"All These Things That I've Done\\".
6304140428|5.0|Since I read the drama of Edward Albee before watching the movie, I had high expectations of the adaption. But I didn't get disappointed! The movie is great! All four actors do an excellent job, but Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton as Martha and George, play their rules to the perfection. The atmosphere in the movie is exactly created as it is supposed to be:- it's shocking! <br /> <br />Martha and George, an older couple, invite Nick and Honey, a younger couple, to come over after a faculty party. Right from the beginning Martha and George start to quarrel heavily in front of their guests. They are tearing each other apart and later even involve Nick and Honey in their sick-minded \\"games\\". Alcohol gets consumed in great quantities. The more alcohol get drunk and the later the evening gets, the more increases the cruelty of the dispute. Finally it ends in a disaster: Martha's and George's son was killed... but to understand this, you should watch this great movie or read the drama.  <br />It's worth it!!
1878424319|5.0|The Four Agreements is a special little book. It is very directly, simply written, and presents the world and life in clear, imaginative, spiritual forms.   Don Miguel Ruiz lays out the ancient Toltec \\"way of life, distinguished by the ready accessibility of happiness and love.\\"  He sites four agreements that must be made within the self, in order to be peace and love. The four agreements are: Be Impeccable With Your Word, Don't Take Anything Personally, Don't Make Assumptions and Always Do Your Best. Without reading the book, they alone offer a way of life. But to read the book is to have them enforced with the knowledge and images of why people choose to struggle instead of choosing to be happy.   I found this a lovely book, something that can be read and re-read in time and opened at random. Either way The Four Agreements can pass on important knowledge and joy.
B000005JAX|5.0|Martin Gore goes at it alone, and boy does he impress! Best words to describe this album are haunting and addictive. He does a much better job than the originals. 'Motherless Child' is simply amazing.  <br />Wished there were more than just the 6 songs. My pleasure is cut way too short.
B00005JMJG|5.0|I watched this movie last night and I loved it. First thing is they created the \\"Dream\\" sequences true to what a normal person would expierence, it was refreshing to see that instead of some hyped up hollywood impression of how dreams are. Second, the dynamics of two main characters was second to none, those two actors did what many would not be able to do, convince the audience that this movie could be real, acutally happing somewhere.  <br /> <br />I'm a big dream person, believing certain real aspects of dreams exist and other ones protrayed in movies are just that, \\"In the movies\\". This movie didn't force me to have a \\"Willingness suspense of belief\\". <br /> <br />Check it out, you'll like it.
B000002UA2|4.0|I don't care how much the reviewers on Amazon rave about the dreadful 'Atom Heart Mother', this CD absolutely destroys it. I even prefer the crystal-clear production on this to 'Dark Side of the Moon' (the legendary LP that followed this  album). 'Obscured By Clouds' features concise songwriting,  fine playing, and you don't have to listen to it 1000 times to appreciate it. I enjoyed most of it from my initial listen. Recommended; thanks for reading.
B00000AOUD|4.0|Bill Bruford and Phil Collins are always the drummers talked about when 70's English progressive rock comes up, but Barriemore Barlow is really amazing on this record.  I just thought that someone ought to mention it.
B00005JN2Z|4.0|\\"Collateral\\" is, in it's own twisted way, a throwback to the crime/noir films of the 40's and 50's, even if modernized quite<br /><br />a bit.  The feel Mann gives the viewer of LA is chaotic, slimy<br /><br />and cheaply attractive all at once.  From the moment Vincent (hitman/sociopath) played by Tom Cruise jumps in for the ride,<br /><br />we feel the city somehow come alive.<br /><br />Never having been even a distant fan of Cruise, I can say he definitely comes into his own here.  Every second he's on screen you can feel the cold, animalistic cunning of a man who has<br /><br />completely sacrificed his conscience (if he ever had one) to<br /><br />the most evil kind of thrills imaginable--murder, aggression, death by numbers.  And, unfortunately for Maxx (Foxx's character), he is very good at the things he indulges in.<br /><br />Contrary to what a lot of other reviewers have said, I really think Jamie Foxx was the weak link here.  He just can't act too well, and in some scenes he seems so ridiculously out of place that the film threatens to turn unintentionally comical.  The one unbelievable aspect is that Vincent could keep this goofball alive.  He's a walking target.<br /><br />That notwithstanding, there are some unforgettable scenes, the foremost being \\"The Jazzman\\": Vincent decides that hey, since he's already offed a bunch of people earlier that day, he's \\"ahead of schedule\\" and Maxx should accompany him to hear some jazz.  We see the a somewhat human side of Vincent for a little while, enjoying the jazz, even buying the musician on stage a drink.  Together (along with Foxx sitting there, looking like a sore thumb) Vincent and the owner talk about Miles Davis, and how he played with him once.  At no point do we sense any real tension, just two men musing over a jazz musician they idolize.  Vincent than asks him if he ever \\"looked him up\\", or played with Davis as he was invited to. The owner replies no, and we see the existential logic flashing in Vincent's eyes, and it is developed later in the movie through Vincent's discussions with Maxx: if you don't go right after your dreams, you're a waste of flesh.  This is Vincent's poor rationale for killing; since people never really live anyway, they might as well die.<br /><br />In a chilling moment, he mentions in a sideways way to the owner precisely why he is there and who sent him.  He toys with him, and then shoots him to death.<br /><br />A few times Mann takes a break from the mayhem and goes on strange comcial notes: when Maxx's boss keeps pestering him<br /><br />on his intercom about going to see his mother, Vincent reasons<br /><br />that since anything unusual might blow his cover, they should go.<br /><br />When Maxx refuses to buy her flowers at the hospital, Vincent turns and says: \\"She carried you in her womb for nine months.\\"<br /><br />The ending is an improbable turn of nail biting events which<br /><br />end in Vincent's death.  It fits with his vicious cynicism and<br /><br />general disregard for human life; he dies from a potshot taken by Maxx and lays dead on the LA subway.  This movie approaches greatness, but I think a Morgan Freeman or a more classical type actor would have been better than Jamie Foxx.  Worth owning, definitely.d it is developed later in the movie through Vincent's discussions with Maxx: if you don't go right after your dreams, you're a waste of flesh.

B0002Z0EYA|5.0|I love these big Hollywood movies with larger than life heroes.  Of course, Homer's heroes are the basis for the archetypes we enjoy in modern day cinema whether it be a Sergio leone movie, a Civil War epic or Die Hard III. <br /> <br />Brad Pitt and Eric Bana assume their respective roles of Achilles and Hector admirably and it doesn't hurt that they are grand physical specimens. <br /> <br />There is much more to enjoy in this exciting movie.  See it.
B0000019PA|5.0|This and The Beatle's White Album are my all-time favorite records.  That's actually saying enough, but I will elaborate:<br /><br />It's something about how the album begins and ends with Jeff's lone acoustic guitar.  Natural, alone.  How his voice is so strained, so honest.  As he takes you into his dream, the music evolves into a whilrwind of sound and noise, but never looses its guitar/voice backbone.  Like having a good friend with you during an intense acid trip.  All the songs somehow blend into one another, yet each tells it's own version of the story.  The images the lyrics bring about are incomprehensible, but at the same time you relate to the emotion of what Jeff is trying to convey.  Some words paint a thousand pictures.<br /><br />This album will grow on you.  Do not dismiss it upon your first listen.  I immediately liked tracks 1 and 3.  2 grew on me next.  Then track 5, 10, and 9.  With each listen, I began to enjoy more and more of the songs.  Eventually I came to love each and every note on the album.  I am listening to it right now for probably the 100+ time, and COINCIDENTALLY my wife it listening to it right now as well in the bedroom!  Yes I got her hooked on it too, and she agrees that it is a spectacular album.<br /><br />Discovering this album has made me a happier person.

B00005JN4O|4.0|This story tells how J.M. Barrie created the now-world famous legend of Peter Pan. He (played in this movie by Johnny Depp) befriended a fatherless family while experiencing professional and personal difficulties. Even his own wife (Radha Mitchell) is drawing away from him.<br /><br />In the staid Victorian world, this frienship subsequently raises some eyebrows; suspicion is immediately upon the two adults. The grandmother is concerned that no man who actually wants to re-marry her daughter will do so with Barrie hanging around, she is really 'tainted' now because of her friendship with a man outside the bonds of marriage.<br /><br />Barrie however is more interested in learning to see the world from the kid's perspective. He does not appear interested in tainting anybody.<br /><br />Being shown Neverland---and its's wonders---essentially rejuvinates Barrie into the world-famous author who we know today. There are very subtle allusions to Barrie's improper interest in the boys, but this is not discernable to many viewers; the focus of the screen play appropriately is on how Barrie comes to create Peter Pan.<br /><br />I did not like her in Titanic, but I honestly loved Kate Winslet in this movie. Her acting was so good that I forgot it was her in the screen play. Ditto for Johnny Depp whom I grew up watching on 21 Jump Street.  I want to see this movie again!
B0002VKZL6|4.0|There is no more talented, erudite recording artist working right now.  Yeah, that's high praise but Knopfler takes a back seat to no one with this record.  The guitars are, as usual, played and mixed perfectly but the real surprise of this record is the songwriting, vocals and melodies.  His vocal range is amazing and perfectly pitched for every song.  Knopfler, occassionally guilty of almost intentionally denying his gift for melody, seems to have finally matched his superb guitar playing with inspired and soaring melodies.  Any fan of any of his previous songs - with Dire Straits or solo - can rest assured that this is as good - if not better than anything he's ever done.  Out of the 14 tracks, at least 10 of them will insinuate themselves into your conciousness immediately. Only 2, by my count, are average. But among the best 10 or so are songs that are simply stunning.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|This movie will go down in my book as one of the top ten comedies I have ever seen.  I haven't laughed this hard while watching a movie in a really long time.  I'm not sure if everyone will feel the same about the humor in the movie, but I thought the movie was hysterical!  Highly recommended!
B00003CWL6|5.0|Lester Burnham ( Kevin Spacy) is a depressed workaholoic man whom is tired of his same-old life including wife ( Annette Bening). His marriage is falling apart, he fantasizes about his daughter's ( Thora Birch) best friend Anjelica ( Mena Suvari) and there's a boy next door whom is obessed with Burham's daughter.<br /><br />A fantastic film worthy of all those awards even for best picture of the year, it's a funny and serious look at suburban America with some great photography, good acting and a nice music score by Thomas Newman. Ot's also a must see movie! it definitely makes you think, laugh and cry with all those emotions to help propell the film.<br /><br />The DVD is stupendous with it's featurette, Commentary by Director Sam Mendes and Alan Ball, two trailers for the film, DVD-Rom stuff, storyboard presenation with commentary and production notes.<br /><br />A beautiful and tragic dark comedy that will definitely be enjoyed for years to come for moviegoers.

B00005JNEI|3.0|Since when is highlighting the truth of what is really happening called Anti-American?  I'll tell you what is Anti-American.....all those who are constantly striving to silence critics of an administration that is ruining our country.  Since when did it become \\"unpatriotic\\" to express opposing views?  I just find it so ironic that we are \\"spreading freedom\\" by occupying countries, destroying their culture, and controlling their airwaves.   Watch the movie.  It is sometimes slow and Moore can be a little much at times, but it has some very powerful scenes.  This is definitely not a documentary because it does not provide enough (or any) opposing viewpoints.  But....at least we are getting a different perspective than the mirage displayed by Fox News and the conservative controlled networks that gave a free pass to Bush for WAYYYYY too long.
B00003CXCT|5.0|These are three movies that changed the way of Sci-fi/fantasy and cinema alike! George Lucas's masterpieces of epic adventure in space. The first movie \\"A New Hope\\" is tells the tale of a farmboy named Luke Skywalker ( Mark Hamil) whom joins up with two robots, a furry wookie and captain Han Solo ( Harrison Ford) to rescue the lovely princess Leia ( Carrie Fisher) then try to defeat \\"Darth Vader\\" ( played by David Prowse and voiced by James Earl Jones). The second chapter \\" Empire Strikes Back\\" is after the events of \\"A New Hope\\" with Luke being trained by master jedi Yoda ( voiced by Frank Oz) to become a Jedi and discovers a dark secret that has been kept hidden from him for years. And finally \\"Return of the Jedi\\", deals with the final battle against the empire as Luke dukes it out with Vader and The Emperor in a effort to save the universe.<br /><br />Three classic sci-fi/fantasy movies that made it into the greatest trilogy on film next to \\"Indiana Jones\\" and \\"Lord of the Rings\\", they grossed millions of dollars at the box-office, excellent acting, inspiring special effects and good plotlines help this movie, nothing can't beat the holy trilogy of movies.<br /><br />The DVD has finally came after years of waiting! i can say the DVD boxset totally delivers all the great stuff like remastered picture & digital sound qualities, commentaries by George Lucas and a great 4th disc with great extras like featurettes, a look into the year's anticipated \\"Episode III\\", Publicity and more.<br /><br />These movies definitely belong in every DVD collection and is a satisfying DVD boxset for everyone to have.
B0002YLC24|5.0|I saw this movie last night. So impressive and mesmerizing. Could not recall the last time I had the warm and peaceful feeling after watching a love story... (maybe the Japanese movie \\"Love Letter\\")... :) <br /> <br />Eager to know how other people think about it, I checked this webiste, and began reading reviews... Different viewers had different opinions, perspective, which made the reading very enjoyable.  <br /> <br />Suddenly, I saw a reviewer gave the movie 1 star and was anxious to read the comment. I was surprised to know that the person hated this movie simply because Julie's exaggerative description of New York City.  <br /> <br />Being an international student in the US, I was really offended by this person's review. If the comment is legitimate, think about how many times American movies do the same thing to other countries and cultures. I don't want to start a quarrel. In fact, I love US, both the country and the people. Just don't want other movie-lovers to miss the chance to appreciate the lovely work of \\"Before Sunset\\". Leah Brown's comment was not objective at all, a very very biased review.  <br /> <br />

B00005JMJ4|1.0|For the life of me, I cannot understand why this movie received so much fanfare from critics.  I thought the movie was absolutely pointless and exceedingly boring!  VERY, VERY, slow and not funny at all. It is actually one of the worst movies I have ever seen (sans Computer Beach Party).  HATE, HATE, HATE this movie!!!!
B000002I25|5.0|The Doors self-titled debut album has to be one of the greatest rock albums of all-time.  The music hits you're ears like a ton of bricks then you're jsut hooked on the Doors.  No band has ever had a sound quite like the Doors. <br /> <br />1.Break on Through 5/5 The first Doors' song I ever heard which quickly got me into The Doors and other classic rock <br /> <br />2.Soul Kitchen 5/5 Not one of the Doors most popular tunes but this is probably my favorite Doors song of all. It has a great beat and singalong chorus <br /> <br />3.Crystal SHip 5/5 I used to think this tripped out journey through Jim morrison's mind was an overrated song but i've recently gotten caught up in the sweetness of the Crystal Ship <br /> <br />4.Twentieth Century Fox 5/5 Alot like SOul KItchen which obviously means it's awesome. U'll be singing this on in your head all day long <br /> <br />5.Alabama Song 4/5 Catchy song about Jim MOrrison's favorite place ..the whiskey bar.. some funny pedafile lyrics too <br /> <br />6.Light My Fire 5/5 The song that skyrocketed the Doors up the charts. Amazing song that includes some killer guitar and keyboard solos in the middle <br /> <br />7.Back Door Man 5/5 Pretty catchy and emotional song and a concert favorite back in the day.  <br /> <br />8.I Looked At You 4/5 One of the Doors more positive tracks with catchy lyrcis <br /> <br />9.End of the Night 4/5 A tripped out spooky song. Prety good to chill too. <br /> <br />10.Take it As it Comes 5/5! OOO what a great song..another of the doors harder songs and one of my favorites <br /> <br />11.The End 5/5 A Long eery song that epitomizes the permanent acid haze on the mind of Jim Morrison. A classic song. <br /> <br />In the end. Everyone needs to have a some copy of this album. Bought or BUrnt its doesnt matter ..just get this album
B0006HXXBA|5.0|I just want to say this: Kreator are legends and whoever bashes them are freaking idiots. I love all types of metal (death, black, thrash, metalcore, Christian, atmospheric hardcore, eclectic, hard rock, NWOBHM, grindcore, traditional, gothic, doom, stoner, and goth rock) and Kreator is one of the bands in my collection. for your information, Korn, Limp Bizkit, and Slipknot are trash and if you want to listen to them, then go stick your head in the sand. if you are a thrash fan, this album is worth your time.

B00005JKEZ|5.0|<br />Warner has leaped into major Criterion Collection territory with this release, an exhaustive package with literally DAYS worth of supplementary viewing.  The Technicolor documentary is a sharp and intelligent work, full of luscious examples of 3-strip color (and a noteworthy discussion of the color scheme in \\"Gone With The Wind,\\" and why it looks nothing like other Technicolor films).  Trailers, cartoons, short subjects, still galleries, commentary...what a labor of love. <br /> <br />The image quality of the film itself may represent the closest thing to a true 35mm Technicolor screening that we have ever had on video.  It is positively three-dimensional.  (Should Fox EVER get around to releasing \\"The Gang's All Here\\" on DVD, it will probably look even better than this). <br /> <br />A friend, viewing this for the first time, noted that it is nothing like a 30s movie.  It's true, almost nothing has dated (for comparison, look at another costume pic of that year--\\"Marie Antoinette,\\" which has dated badly). I would say only the score and, as mentioned in the documentary, deHavilland's eyebrows, are the giveaways to when the movie was made.  <br /> <br />A major film in every way.  With a presentation to match.
B000003TA4|5.0|pay no attention to what the guy below me says.  first of all nirvana wasn't huge in the 80's, they were huge in the 90's.  second of all nirvana was famous long before kurt cobain killed himself...his inability to handle all the attention was an important factor in his problems.  anyone reading these reviews because they've never heard nirvana should just get ahold of all their albums.  best band of all time perhaps. unless you absolutely hate punk rock, and even if you do there are still songs on all their albums you will like.

B00005JMXX|5.0|i've noticed that many people who have seen this movie don't like it precisely because of the message it gives. perhaps the destruction was overly dramatic, but honestly, who watches movies where people slowly suffocate because of smog levels? people need to take into account that pollution is on the rise, and we are not doing anything to stop it. its not just the burning of fossile fuels either-take a look at the wide-spread destruction of old growth forests. this has to stop.
B0000039QA|3.0|we all know that 2pac is >>>>> than biggie but I'm being as objective for this review as possible, this album would have been good as ready to die if he made it a single album and took out all the filler songs.  This double album came out about a year after 2pac's all eyez on me, and I have both and I listen to this once every 6 months and I listen to 2pacs every 2 weeks on average.  ALOM is a flawless album in every sense of the word, If you liked this, You'll love that. Biggie shouldn't  have copied pac by dropping the 2nd double rap album after pac.  <br />2pac can't can compared to any other rapper and thats a FACT, quote me biatch. <br />On a side note, biggie is vastly overrated, he has a sick flow, but that could only do so much, I bet you the only reason big is regarded as he is, is cuz while pac was battling big, big was repping nyc, and since nyc is where hiphop is, nyc is going all out for big, and thats why he is overrated. If pac was repping nyc at his death and biggie was repping west coast, biggie would have been another G. Black, not nearly as well regarded as he is, and that's another fact.
0375507256|2.0|If the writer stuck to the first three story lines this would have gotten a better rating. Unfortunately the middle sections, where everything 'came together' seemed contrived at best. I skimmed over the Korean ultra-capitalist section. It seemed to have some promise but was cut short. The Hawaii section at the end of human kind would have been interesting if the dialect the writer tried to use wasn't so obtuse. A half a page of 'dialect' is hard to read, dozens are not worth the effort.
B0001BKAEY|5.0|For those of you who ask for comparisons between Star Wars and the Matrix series, the answer is a very simple one.  There ain't none!  It would be like comparing apples to potatoes.  It just doesn't work.  What we have in the Matrix Trilogy is a new benchmark in the scifi world.  There has never been anything like it.  As with an artichoke, one must peel back each layer because there are many.  It requires the viewer to watch it more than once or even twice.  The Matrix requires some actual thought unlike other films that do the thinking for you.  Everything is on the screen.  No need to think.  The average moviegoer has become lazy.  When a picture like this comes along we don't understand it.  It appears not to make sense, hence we don't understand what we're seeing.  Hence the bad reviews that many folks have dished out.  We don't want to work for our entertainment.  We just want to take the \\"blue pill\\" and be told that we are being entertained.    It is for this reason that I emplore you not only to view the Matrix Trilogy for the first time but many times after that.  As I have stated in my reviews of The Matrix and The Matrix Reloaded, I too have had to watch it more than twice because I didn't think much of them at first viewing.  But having seen them all many times over now I have turned into the biggest Matrix fan I know.   There are those of you who know nothing about computers and you may surely become confused but not to worry.  Just find the nearest computer geek and he/she will explain all.     There are those out there that have practically turned this trilogy into a religion all on it's own.  I dare say, you need not go that far.  There are elements in the film that correlate with the story of Jesus and the Wachowski brothers state that this was intentional.  I don't know what the rationale was behind that decision but whatever it was, it clicks with the audiences.  Pastors are breaking the film down and showing pieces of it to their congregations, philosophers debate it and the great thinkers of our time are expressing their views about meaning behind The Matrix.    (Beware of Spoilers below)    This movie concludes the trilogy with the death of Trinity and Neo and the end of the war between man and machine.  The Oracle told Neo that he or Morpheus would die in the first film.  And so it came to pass.  Neo so loved Trinity that he could not imagine life without her.  That is one of the reasons  why he fought so hard against the machine world.  He could not be separated from her.  With her death however, he was now able to sacrifice himself for Zion.  Perhaps he did not even want to live without her.  It just so happened that the plan he and the oracle had would benefit Zion so perhaps his death was not as self-sacrificing as it appeared to be.  What would he have done if  Trinity had lived?    While this film does mimic the story of Jesus it also (I'm sorry to say) mocks Him at the same time.  His name is constantly used in vain as a swear word.  Unfortunately, it does bother those of us who worship the Lord.  It could send mixed messages to those who are not spiritually educated in these matters but that's why Christians should view this film.  It's our job to point out certain items and educate.  It's very important to use the vehicles that we can use to minister.  Many people will not see the Jesus story here because they don't know it.      The basic concept of The Matrix is so new that it boggles the mind.  Humans being cultivated and used as an alternative source of power for a machine world.  Some humans want freedom and others are content to remain in the matrix.  Those who fight the matrix await the coming of a savior (foretold by Morpheus-a John the Baptist sort of character) who has the ability to save them.  Imagine that your life and all that you knew was only a dreamworld that the matrix cooked up for you.  In reality you are being kept in a vat of liquid, connected to cables, unable to speak orsee, suppling the machine world with the power it needs to exist.  Humans are no longer born but grown by the machines.  Brilliant concept!  I'm surprised that no one thought of it sooner in this age of the computer. The Matrix is almost like a living super hero comic for adults.    Please give this trilogy a chance.  This is the movie that all future scifi will be measured against.  If you miss it then you'll wonder where all the new scifi came from.  Just as Star Wars broke ground in it's day, now we have The Matrix which has broken new ground.  No matter what comes next in the Star Wars saga, Star Wars is dead.  Long live The Matrix!!!
B00005JMYI|2.0|After some excellent work by Will Ferrell in 'Old School' and 'Elf', I decided to go out and get 'Anchorman' despite some pretty bad reviews I had been hearing. However, the reviews were right and Anchorman dissapoints. Ferrell plays 1970's anchorman Ron Burgundy for Channel 4 news in San Diego, and is on top of the world. He's a local legend, his station is number 1, and even little kids know who Ron Burgundy is. However, to add more diversity to the news, they hire a female, Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate of 'Married with Children') to the team. Eventually, she becomes co-anchor with Burgundy. We now have the typical battle of the sexes going on, while they both try to get the lead anchor position. <br /> <br />There are some good cameos by Vince Vaugn, who will always come in second place to Ferrell's TV ratings, Ben Stiller, who plays a Hispanic anchorman, and Jack Black, the angry biker who gets a burrito thrown at him by Burgundy. The funniest character in this movie, no, not Ferrell, but Steve Carell who plays the clueless weatherman, Brick Tamland. With an IQ of 48, he is officially mentally retarded, and get ready for some classic scenes. Overall, you can expect a few good laughs in 'Anchorman', but none of them coming from Ferrell. <br /> <br />
0316926345|2.0|FORMAT. There is one narrator, Simon Ryder.  The novel is in four parts.  The first and last are in the \\"present\\" while the middle two are in the \\"past.\\"  The middle two compose the bulk of the book.      SYNOPSIS. The first of them is apparently about an eccentric h*m*s*x**l alcoholic, Sebastian Flyte (I wrote that word that way to deceive the automatic censor).  It is mostly about how his alcoholism gets him kicked out of Oxford and how his family tries to get him dried up, without avail.  Ryder is in the background, but interacts with the other characters.    The second of them is apparently about the affair between Ryder and Flyte's sister Julia.  They both are unhappily married and decide to divorce their spouses and then marry one another.  However, after they are divorced but before they remarry (or something like that), Julia's father dies.  He had become a Catholic to marry his wife, but had been excommunicated later.  But, in his death throes, he made some gestures that might have indicated that he wanted to become a Catholic again.  The whole family (also Catholic), whether observant or not, is concerned about his soul.  They are therefore relieved when it seems he might have repented.  Ryder, seeing this, suddenly stops being a jaded agnostic and believes in God.  He and Julia decide not to marry after all, since Catholicism forbade remarriage unless the marriage was annulled by the Holy See.    The first and last parts are Ryder returning to the Flyte family house (known as Brideshead, it being at the head of the stream called Bride) years later.      EVALUATION. The dialogue is frequently scintillating and delightful.  The narration has some great phrases.  Take, for example, the metaphor, \\"thin bat's squeak of sexuality audible only to me,\\" which refers to his reaction when a girl asks him to light a cigarette, apparently requiring him to put it in his mouth.  The narration, however, is obnoxious at times.  Waugh tried to use a physics metaphor without even describing the metaphor, pleading ignorance of physics.      The division of the book mostly into two separate stories is bad.  It disassociates parts of the story from one another, interrupting the narrative and one's identification with the characters.  In fact, the two halves seem like different novels.     The whole feel of the story of a dysfunctional English aristocratic family in the 1930s was warm and fuzzy.     Now for the book's purpose, which is supposedly to show divine grace.  Firstly, I do not like novels that try to demonstrate a proposition or teach a lesson.  Secondly, I do not like the proposition or lesson of this book.  Are we to believe that grace comes at certain times to certain persons for no given reason?  That seems quite odd.  The idea that one has lived his whole life one way can suddenly decide to change at the last minute is inexplicable.  Also, it seems that the book is saying that those raised Catholic cannot escape the faith.  That seems to deny the power of choice of the one taught.  I regard these theses as repugnant.
0316666343|4.0|Alice Sebold's national bestseller, Lovely Bones, is a book that any woman of this modern age should read. It is a book that can show present day reality to its fullest from a very different perspective.  <br /> This book takes place in 1973 when a young girl, Susie Salmon (14), was raped and killed on her way home from school in early December. George Harvey, a neighbor, commits the crime, but it is never proven guilty by the local police force investigating the crime. The story is told from Susie's point of view on earth before she is killed and from heaven after. \\"In my mind I [Susie] had wandered between bittersweet joy of seeing my mother name all the things I carried and loved and her futile hope that these thing mattered.\\" (P. 21). She tells of how her family and closest friends are affected by their loss.  <br /> Sebold makes this book a very enjoyable and smooth read. She makes you feel like you are inside the story and you are one of the characters and Susie is just telling you her story.  <br />This book is written to capture the reader, and it does just that. Having Susie tell the story as she is watching her family and friends on Earth creates a different viewing point that sets this book aside from many other books. \\"When I [Susie] first entered heaven I thought everyone saw what I saw.\\" (P.16). It is interesting to see the way Sebold portrays heaven as a unique Utopia. The way this book is written makes it hard to put down. Something new is constantly happening but the flow remains consistent.  <br /> This book is filled with many tragic and yet many glorious situations. The only problem is that things work out too well in the end. To have a 14 year old girl raped and killed, and then have a relatively happy ending does not seem to be realistic. \\"I would like to tell you that it is beautiful here, that I am, and you will one day be, forever safe. But this heaven is not about safety just as, in its graciousness, it isn't about gritty reality. We havefun.\\" (P.324) This quote is Susie talking about \\"her\\" heaven. Although her murderer was never caught in the book, things worked out for her, her family and all of the main characters in the book; which seems highly unlikely.  <br /> Lovely Bones is a wonderful read for any woman today. But readers beware. This book is extremely depressing at times, but spirits will pick up along the way thanks to Sebold's unique writing style. I would highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys novels with depth and meaning.  <br />
B00004T9UF|4.0|I'm confounded, like so many others.  Do I object the seeming viciousness, or do I argue artistic freedom?  I'd rather cast aside the debate and revel in the artistic whole. Of his brilliance, there is no question - I'm no hip-hop authority, but I swear his verbal dexterity matches, in skill, Jay-Z and dare I say Rakim. His delivery, poetic, his poetry vile, disturbing, riveting, hilariously funny and mind-numbingly painful, and maybe that's the point, proving no more or less a threat to the psyche as a whole as any latest cinematic insult by the deplorable likes of a Greg Araki or a John Waters. As a gay man, his use of the 'F' word [as in anti-gay rhetoric] is not offensive to me as it is disappointing in his naive explanation for utilizing it...besides, as an equal opportunity offender, he has more despairing ghosts to fry. Is this the disgorging of a homophobic misanthrope? I don't think so.  Is this the work of a genius satirist? Perhaps. Is it also a work of artistic triumph? Absolutely.  Some hoped that the succubi that fed of his mind were finally purged for a kinder gentler future Marshall.  But after 'The Eminem Show,' and '8 Mile' a kinder, gentler Eminem was no where to be found [although he's mellowing with the less than thrilling 'Encore']. But that would have been boring. If he is the end of the world as we know it, we'll be fine.  My grade: A
6305161992|5.0|The scene in which Japanese-American actor Cary Hiroyuki-Tagawa (who also played the father in the children's TV series, \\"Johnny Tsunami\\") and the actress playing a *smoking-hot* blonde drug addict engage in sexual \\"foreplay\\" with the kantana blade was actually very hot, in a cheesy yet very original and sexy sort of way.  Totally worth the viewing just for that scene!
B00018D44U|3.0|If imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, then what's to say when you carbon copy yourself? When your voice is as astonishingly clear and silky as Jones's, you say congratulations.  Don't fix what ain't broke...and  'Feels Like Home' is a comforting, familiar sophomore effort by a young artist still honing her indelible craft while not pandering to a new audience or defiling her core fan base. Arif Mardin produces again [actually, co-producing w/Norah], Jesse Harris back strumming his acoustic guitar on a few tracks, her Handsome Band backing up quietly and seductively, Dolly Parton and Levon Helm lending support, covering Tom Waits splendidly, and with her ravishing voice and heavenly Yamaha, establishing herself as never-really-a-jazz-singer, but a supreme force of nature.  My grade: B+
B0002858YS|4.0|&#65279;The resurgence of the post-punk movement at the turn of this decade has always felt like a trend, even though it's brooding mood paints a perfect picture of it. Now that it has gone into act two, the trend is in real danger of lasting longer than the original era that inspired it. The Killers comes in after Interpol, The Strokes, and now Modest Mouse and Franz Ferdinand to solidify this sound as something that's going to stay around for a while for better or worse. There are aspects of this style of making music that never gets old, but year after year after year does put it's limitations in sharp relief. \\"Hot Fuss\\" is a very solid album that marries some of the best aspects of bands that have inspired The Killers. The glacier however has already taken enough people by surprise, and now they know what to expect. That's one of the main anchors keeping this album out of orbit. This sound is just not \\"the hot new thing\\" anymore. Those who do appreciate it all the better anyway will find total satisfaction in \\"Hot Fuss\\", as there is more than enough here to satisfy any post-punk lover's appetite.<br /><br />\\"On Top\\", \\"Believe Me Natalie\\", \\"Smile Like You Mean It\\", and \\"Somebody Told Me\\" are as good as anything you'll find on an album like this. While the lack lyrical ingenuity is certainly something that betrays them at times (lines like \\"I got soul/but I'm not a soldier\\" are slightly less than forgivable), the style, as with similar bands (Interpol for example) is enough to make up the distance left by those shortcomings. Most people who buy these records have no idea who Ian Curtis is, so it proves to be a very escapable standard. Even those of us who do tend to overlook such things because the thrill that bands like this even exist is still more than enough to warrant looking the other way. \\"Hot Fuss\\" is definitely not something that's not worth any fans of bands like The Killers time. Even though it appears a slight bit more contrived now, a few years in. It only seems that way, albums like this have always been very well produced slick things, but now with bands like The Killers who take their cues from bands who take their cues from a previous set, it just becomes a little harder to ignore.<br /><br />(Order the US version, or get the digital. Avoid the UK version of this album like the plague. \\"Indie Rock and Roll\\" is truly bad, the US track is much better.....I happened to download mine so I have them both).ems that way, albums like this have always been very well produced slick things, but now with bands like The Killers who take their cues from bands who take their cues from a previous set, it just becomes a little harder to ignore.

B00002MZ4W|4.0|The space cadet kook-fest she personified with the uneven \\"Tidal\\" is vanished and in her place comes this generations premiere poet/songwriter. \\"When The Pawn...\\" [a condensed mantra that goes on for 90 words] elaborates further Apple's promise/disappointment of \\"Tidal\\", a debut that too often pandered to cacophonous ramblings too mature for their own good. She showed a fierce ability for intense melody and adult vocals, but too often fumbled in the face of all the confusion. With \\"...Pawn\\", Apple allocates brilliantly, a middle ground for her vocal capability and intricate melody and phrasing. Her songwriting would make [early] Joni Mitchell proud, evoking a poets pen more so than any of the newer, young singer/songwriters.  And if Sony Music has the balls to release her new 'Extraordinary Machine' single, then you will all see exactly what i mean.  My grade:  A
0385513755|5.0|I heard about it 3 weeks ago, a family member brought it with her and she seemed delighted with the book, I thought \\"If she likes it, why not give it a try?\\" I bought it 3 days from today and finished it in two days because I just couldn't put the book down. A mistery behind Da Vinci's masterpieces- The Last Supper, The Mona Lisa, The Madonna Of The Rocks, etc. seemed to hide a secret silenced by the Church by milleniums. The Saint Grail? Could Jesus be in reality someone who's not who we think he is? If you are smart enough, you will put faith aside and read the book as what it is: A great thriller. I never would thought Leonardo Da Vinci hid so many secrets in his paintings but thanks to the illustrated version of the book, those lines made a lot of sense. Yes, there's a woman in The Last Supper. Yes, it looked like Uriel's finger was cutting off an invisible head gripped by Mary's hand posture. Yes, the Mona Lisa was a mixture of two ancient gods representing each gender: AMON & Isis or L'ISA, MONA LISA. If the book doesn't make you doubt about your beliefs, at least use it to learn something new, I did. The Da Vinci Code is an intelligent thriller with a topic that will never stop creating controversy: Religion.
B0006399FS|1.0|Do you remember when Bono had credibility ?. Do you remember when Bono told us nothing but the truth ?. Yes, that was the OLD U2. The old U2 is not this one comming back, no way !!.  <br />It's time to point out this sold old iPod band has nothing from their 80's glory here. I mean, NOTHING. Bono ? he can't sing anymore. Do you remember the line ? \\"Scream without rising your voice\\". Moreover he's afraid to talk about about the real world, he knows that would be a huge risk for the album sales.  <br /> <br />\\"AMERICA IS JUST FULL OF POSSIBILITIES\\" he said a while ago. Yes, that's just propaganda for his loved USA and his friend George W. Bush. I feel bad for him, I hate to see a sold out singer in that shameful way. Do you remember Bullet The Blue Sky now ?.  <br />Indeed in their best times they didn't have problems in recognizing the bad foreign policy of the USA, and that didn't affect the sales at all. Now they wait desperate for another September 11th, since that was what increased considerably the sales of All That You Can't Leave Behind, after all the tributes on each U2 concert ever since, the super bowl, etc. <br /> <br />All their well-known producers must go, and U2's mainstream hype as well. I respected the effort to reinvent themselves. They've been doing wrong since they scrapped their own masterpiece \\"Pop\\". <br />Then...the well-known bothering history. An overrated band getting more and more Grammy and cash just because of their name alone.  <br /> <br />How To make fool of fans ( it should be the album name ) achieves pretty much nothing ( for sure they'll get grammy and millions of dollars for this washed up piece of trash ). So I dislike it strongly, got rid of the album, occasionally shed a tear over the precipitous decline of a great band, and get on with my life. I hope these fashioned men don't put out anything else, because they're only making fools of themselves, but that doesn't detract from all the very good music they've given us over theyears.  <br /> <br />This album is nothing but \\"talk without speaking\\". <br /> <br />\\"All the promises we break <br />From the cradle to the grave\\"... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000062YAZ|5.0|I would like start off by saying this is the best band out! No band even comes close to what Slayer has done and it's manly on this cd that they do it. Now also I don't know why you punks out there think that metallica has any cd better then anything Slayer has put out. I mean come on Metallica is all washed up now. Sure back in 80's they rocked, but just not as hard Slayer though. There has so meny bands out there now that got alot of inspration from Slayer aka any death or black metal band and bunch of new bands that just came out. With out Slayer you wouldn't have about half the bands we do today. Sure Black Sabbath path the way for everyone, but Slayer is crazy! Anyone who doesn't like Slayer needs to just die! Because theres no band out there like Slayer so quit bashing on this cd and anything else they have put out because it's all good as long as it's Slayer.

0446613444|5.0|I've started reading the Harry Bosch novels in order (I'm funning that way).  This of course is the second in the series.  The characters were fresh and real.  The mystery in the plot was there, however when all was revealed you could go, \\"ah ha\\". Hope you enjoy.
068987474X|5.0|I must admit that when I purchased this book I was expecting it to have more of a fictional feel to it.  Not so.  It truly does touch on the reality of the dating world and how men manipulate women.  For me this book was a blessing because for many years I was in a \\"broken\\" relationship always trying to patch things up.  I didn't want to face the reality of the situation and hoped that by catering to my partner that he would eventually appreciate me enough to change and want to marry me.  None of this happened and the relationship crumbled apart.  Had I known the information from this book sooner I would've been out the door way earlier and would have saved myself that much more time.  To some women, leaving a bad relationship might be be obvious, but it isn't to everyone out there hence the reason why not all couples are happy.    Also I believe that by the authors refering to the women readers as sexy and so on (even if you disbelieve that you are) has nothing to do with if you are or not.  I personally believe that if you think you are sexy the natural beauty within you will come out for others to see, perhaps attracting a life partner...aka the man you're supposed to be with.  For those that don't believe in this then perhaps you will be miserable and lonely for the rest of your life.
B0002XDODU|4.0|Yet another good quality CD by Rammstein. I am one of their biggest fans but I guess most fans of theirs say that? The songs are all Brilliant. But the reason why I give it 4 stars is because I'm not to keen on the song Los. It doesn't sound like Rammstein. If that song weren't in the album then this would get a 5/5. Hopefully they will have more albums out in the future.
0380713802|4.0|Bill Bryson does make fun of the cultures he encounters in this book.  Yep, on just about every page.  But guess what?  He also makes fun of his own native culture, America (for an entire book of Bryson poking fun at the oddities of American culture, see \\"I'm A Stranger Here Myself\\") and of the UK, the country that he adopted as his own for 20 years.  No, Bill Bryson is not a xenophobe: he makes fun of everyone equally, and he does it in a way which makes it obvious that he is in loving awe of the differences that can occur amongst members of the same species depending on where/how/by whom they were raised.   <br /> <br />This book has two personalities to it- the involved tourist and the observational tourist.  Bryson spends some time recalling the previous trek he took across Europe in the 1970's with his friend (of \\"A Walk in the Woods\\" notoriety) when he was much more involved in what was going on around him.  He communicated with the people and the culture of the places he visited.  During his return visit, 20 years later as a lone middle-aged tourist, he was less involved and chose to merely peer through the glass at the places he visited; this part of the story involves a lot of \\"I went from here to here, I couldn't find a hotel, the last bus had left, no one spoke English,\\" etc etc.  While this aspect of the book might not be as fun to read as Bryson's misadventures from other books, it is endearing because it is real.  This is not a book that gushingly romanticizes travel, rather it is one witty, sarcastic man's take on the people and cultures that he encountered, both in the 1990's as a middle aged American expat, and in the 1970's as a curious 20-something backpacker.  My favorite Bryson book.
B000002PC6|5.0|In October 1981, Olivia Newton-John released \\"Physical\\" <br /> <br />BEFORE: <br />The poster-girl of sweet wholesome pop music, Olivia began changing her image in Grease and the \\"Totally Hot\\" album which followed suit.  She also had appeared in the movie Xanadu, which flopped but had a hit soundtrack.   This was to be her first studio album in three years. <br /> <br />AFTER: <br />The title track was a #1 hit for ten weeks (making it the #1 song of the 1980's), the album went double platinum and peaked at #6.  The album had another top five hit with \\"Make A Move On Me\\".  Olivia was on top of the world at the moment.  Hosting SNL, preparing to open Koala Blue, and embarking on a wildly successful 1982 tour.  This was the peak of Olivia's popularity. <br /> <br /> <br />While Physical, the track, has been overplayed to the extent that the song is a caricature instead of an actual record,  the album as a whole retains as the strongest album of Livvy's career. <br /> <br />1. Landslide (5/5) is the perfect leadoff single.  The song is fast, dancy and sets the pace for the record. <br />2. Stranger's Touch (5/5) is even better (a shame it wound up on a b-side).  The sexiest moment off the album. <br />3. Make A Move On Me (5/5) is a classic and is catchy as hell. The video was terrible but the song makes up for it. <br />4. Falling (5/5) is a beautiful acoustic haunting ballad about falling in love.  <br />5. Love Make Me Strong (3.5/5) is a good song but probably the worst track. <br />6. Physical (5/5),  what needs to be said about it?  everyone knows this song. <br />7. Silvery Rain (5/5).  Olivia was caring about the environment back when most of the \\"environmentalist\\" rock stars weren't even signed yet.  The song rocks and is one of the best of the album.  Starts out like a mellow 70's ONJ rock song and then becomes a rocker during the chorus.  Even though Cliff Richard did the song a decade before Livvy, you can tell she deeply cares about the lyrics. <br />8. Carried Away (4.5/5).  A pretty Gibb ballad that was originally written but then rejected for Barbra Streisand's \\"Guilty\\" album, and it probably wouldn't have fit there because it's structured a little too much like \\"Woman In Love\\".  A soothing upbeat early 80's ballad you could listen to in the tub. <br />9. Recovery (4/5) kinda reminds me of \\"(Want You) Back In My Life\\" by The Carpenters.  Kind of a tropical sounding sound with very audible John Farrar background vocals. <br />10. The Promise (4.5/5).  Another environmentalist ballad.  Very beautiful and Olivia sings about her love for dolphins (you can hear dolphins in the background).  A beautiful song. <br /> <br />I would love Universal to remaster this (I know there's an import) and add some bonus tracks from the period... I heard Olivia recorded a demo of \\"I Paralyse\\" around this album, which ended up being recorded by Cher the next year (which was produced by Farrar too)

B000002L99|2.0|there's two camps of Van Halen fans:  Roth fans and Hagar fans (I've never met a Cherone fan).   As history told us, Roth abruptly exited Van Halen in early 1985 for a solo career,  Van Halen replaced him with Montrose frontman and solo star Sammy Hagar.   Was the \\"Van Hagar\\" lineup a success?  it depends. <br /> <br />5150 came out in mid-1986 and one-upped 1984 by going to #1 (but in all fairness, \\"1984\\" was #2 behind Michael Jackson's \\"Thriller\\", the biggest album of all time... 1984 still sold twice as much and spent a longer time on the charts).   When I first the album in the late 1980's, I loved it, even tho I was a bigger fan of the DLR lineup, I did think 5150 was a rocking album. <br /> <br />However, as time has passed,  5150 has not aged very well.  Even tho it's predecessor 1984 was also a product of the excessive synthesizer age, that album holds up very well and to this day, songs like \\"House Of Pain\\" and \\"Panama\\" STILL rock, and songs like \\"Jump\\" and \\"I'll Wait\\" still sound great, even if you can tell those songs are products of twenty years ago.   On the other hand, many of the songs I thought rocked on 5150 just don't do it now. <br /> <br />I used to love \\"Good Enough\\", \\"Why Can't This Be Love\\", \\"5150\\" and \\"Summer Nights\\", but age hasn't been kind to these songs.   Alex's electronic drums make this album very dated to the extent the music's lost it's enjoyment. <br /> <br />If you want a good \\"Van Hagar\\" album, try out \\"For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge\\", that was the album they finally found their identity without Roth,
0393324818|5.0|Here is a book that can be appreciated from so many different angles.  For fans of baseball (which I'm not) the allure is obvious.  For fans of statistics, this book offers amazing insight into how numbers can be employed in real life with very pwerful and very real results.  For fans of human nature, this story offers a great look at how mistakes can be repeated and then perpetuated until someone with a strong mind and a stronger will comes along to break the cycle.  And for fans of character-driven stories, Moneyball, like any Michael Lewis tale, has that in spades too. <br /> <br />If any of that sounds good to you, give this one a try.

0440180295|5.0|Hard to describe this one except to say that I loved it.<br /><br />Really a book-within-a-book, Vonnegut's tale gets you turned around with great story telling and (in some instances) wonderful use of absurdity.

B00005RY7X|5.0|Andrew WK likes to party, and he doesn't much care who with. Right in the opening track, \\"It's Time To Party,\\" he invites: \\"Hey, you! Let's party!\\" He also advocates the philosophy of \\"Party 'Till You Puke\\" and advises one to \\"Party Hard.\\" Other standouts include \\"I Love NYC,\\" \\"Ready To Die\\" and the craziest love song ever written, \\"She Is Beautiful,\\" a song about the girl you've always seen from across the room and never had the guts to talk to. But the real magic, beyond AWK's from-the-gut songwriting, is in the production. <br /> <br />Every track sounds like it has about 50 guitars hammering away, along with some crazy '80s synths thrown in for good measure. The drums sound like each drum is about 10 feet across and was recorded in a giant bathroom. And the vocals are stacked one on top of another, shouting out melodies, harmonies, etc. <br /> <br />The bottom line is, anyone who enjoys life should own this album. This is the first breath of fresh air after being inside all day. This is the first drink of water on a 100 degree afternoon. This is the sound of being alive.

B0000028RR|5.0|You know, sometimes i like to go and look at the 1 star reviews of CDs i own and many times it makes me laugh. The ones i'm reading here are downright hilarious. It's mostly conservative people accusing them of being communist/anarchists/aetheists etc. For those who are saying they suck because they were a sell-outs for using a corporate giant you need to think about it before calling them that. One of the simplist ways of getting your message accross nowadays is music, the bigger the label the better, that way your message gets out to millions of people. They weren't selling-out, they were being smart. True, if your views are more conservative you'll hate the lyrics that Zach has written. However, if you don't care about the views in the lyrics, or believe in what he says, than it's a good cd overall. <br /> <br />Favorite Tracks: Bombtrack, Township Rebellion, Freedom, Wake Up
B00000K3D4|5.0|As a child I loved this movie....now, as an adult when I understood that all these magical creatures are HANDMADE, I have a completely newfound respect for it....there are not enough stars to rate this movie!!! It makes me sad that computer graphics have taken over the world of fantasy movies...there really is something more realistic about something being made of actual materials.(also Brian Froud is a pure genius!!)
B0002M6QLS|5.0|This is a hellova movie!!! I love it and wish they made more movies of this particular version (I mean after Taxi 3). Actors, action, sense of humor are fantastic!!!!! Car chases incredible!  (Go, Peugeot! I bet Peugeot had to pay tons of money for their car's advertisement, eh?). Anyways - I highly recommend this wonderful movie!!! Especially this, French, original movie, NOT American poorly made, pathetic copy! <br />GO, LUC BESSON!!!  <br />
B00006V9A0|5.0|I'm not a fan of all of Nirvana's work. I'll be honest, some of it just ends up sounding the same to me.  But all of these songs stand out.  Kurt wasn't a genious songwriter but i think often in the bands musical and lyrical simplicity came an unentended perfected genious.  Songs that just simply what they mean, and do not try and act pretensious and artistic.  'You know your right' has got to be one of my favorite Nirvana songs, and after I learned Kurt had killed himself (everyone debates that, but whatever i didnt know him personally so i dont know what happened) the song becomes so friggin eerie and its so forboading to his death.  ('If I was put into this/Always knew it would come to this, Things have never been so swell/ i have never felt so well)  I don't think Nirvana was as big of a cultural phenomonon as many people claim.  I just never saw any change in the 90's created by thier presence.  But all that aside, they were a very good band its too bad that they couldn't have made some more wonderfull songs such as these.
B00006LI4S|1.0|I Generally love any Pink Floyd music, including David Gilmour, <br />and Roger Waters. I own DVDS of each one.  This one is terrible. <br />It gave me the feeling that David Gilmour is over the hill and  <br />done for. I don't want to believe this but, thats the feeling  <br />I had after watching this Concert. Nothing Personal just very <br />disappointed by this DVD.

B00005JNBQ|5.0|Chapped Stick, Chapped Lips, and things like Tetherball.<br /><br />As an independant film maker, I walk into any such film with an open mind, and wish them the best of luck. This time, it was all I could do to contain myself. Now everyone I know has heard about Napoleon Dynamite.<br /><br />There are many incredible things about the picture. First, its a simple story without any extravagances. No melodramatic overtones, nor the cardboard cut-out characteristics, just a laid back comedy. Can I get a \\"Sweet?\\" Plus the intention non-use of bad language. It's possible after all...<br /><br />When I had the opportunity to meet Roger Ebert, I wish I had seen this film and known his viewpoint of it. There would have been some serious questions. I have read through many critics likes and dislikes. (Cause apparently this is an \\"everone loves it or hates it\\" kind of movie.) Mainly those that dislike it want \\"form.\\" Dynamite needs no form. You jump into his mixed-up life for a couple of days, then jump back out again.<br /><br />I guarantee those that love silly humor will be quoting lines for weeks. If lines like: \\"Ow, I think your bruising my neck meat!\\", puts a pedro-sized grin on your face, then you will be rolling.<br /><br />A great movie that you can watch over and over. ~saos~
B00005AAFS|5.0|Originally hearing \\"Feuer Frie!\\" in the opening of XXX, I was hooked from the moment I heard them. Rammstein goes absolutely nuts in their latest CD, dishing out the best of an already awesome musical set. Whether or not you speak German, whether or not you're into rock and metal and whether or not you enjoy songs about violence or sex, this is a must-have album. <br /> <br />\\"Mein Herz Brennt\\" - The album begins quietly, gradually building up to the harmonic chorus. A great song in itself and an excellent way to start the album, though you've yet to hear the best of it. 8.5/10 <br /> <br />\\"Link 2 3 4\\" - Somehow this song remins me of Wolfenstein 3D. Rammstein almost creates a new rock genre here. I could just see 'Military Metal' as another subsection in ten or so years. Very exhilerating, with an excellent beat. 9.5/10 <br /> <br />\\"Sonne\\" - The rather odd and misleading beginning to this song actually carries into its chorus. Til counts from one to nine, ending with 'Out!' The rest of the song is very powerful, relying more on choir than on guitars. 9/10 <br /> <br />\\"Ich Will\\" - Rammstein succesfully recreates the feeling of a live band getting feedback from their audience. The song is very enjoyable, but Rammstein does much better throughout the rest of the album. 8.5/10 <br /> <br />\\"Feuer Frie\\" - The ULTIMATE heavy metal song, and I mean it. Metalheads will listen to this song time and time again. Even if you're not into Rammstein's heavier stuff, you're going to love this one. An absolute masterpiece. 10/10 <br /> <br />\\"Mutter\\" - Possibly the best song in the album, owing to emotional value. It's not Rammstein's heaviest, but it does have the deepest impact. Following the tale of a child born in a science lab, its heavy chorus seems to vibrate throughout your body. Chances are you'll need to listen to it more than once to absorb it, though. 10/10 <br /> <br />\\"Spielhur\\" - A very subjective song; you'll either love it or find it mediocre. Very nice beat, excellent rythm and a definite variation in instruments. 9/10 <br /> <br />\\"Zwitter\\" - One of Rammstein's heavier and more amusing songs, Zwitter follows the tale of a hermaphrodite. Very fast-paced. 9.5/10 <br /> <br />\\"Rein Raus\\" - Yet another of Rammstein's heavier songs, Rein Raus is similar to \\"Link 2 3 4,\\" in its tune and rythm. This one is based off sex, which is all the more reason to learn German. ;) 9.5/10 <br /> <br />\\"Adios\\" - Starting off slow, Adios builds up to a heavy climax with an excellent riff. A favourite of many fans. 9.5/10 <br /> <br />\\"Nebel\\" - A great way to end the album, Nebel is the slowest track on the CD, and it describes a man's last kiss. Metalheads may be disappointed; otherwise it can be viewed as Rammstein's best. 9.5/10 <br /> <br />This is Rammstein's best, and hopefully not their last. This band is getting much closer to achieving musical perfection, and you're only doing yourself a favour by purchasing \\"Mutter.\\"
0385513755|5.0|The Da Vinci Code is a a subtle and mesmerizing novel that is laced with reality and fabulous research and illustrations. It is clearly an anti-organized religion book designed to plant the seed of doubt in the mind of the readers. Regardless of the motives, it is a marvelous book to read !!!
B0001Z52RU|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie in the theatre and I absolutely love it on DVD. The DVD contains a lot of features like mini-documentaries and a heart-stopping alternate ending! How Ashton Kutcher's character can weave in and out of time to change the past and effect the future could've been a complete disaster but kudos to the screenplay and the director for holding a complex story together.  <br />
068987474X|1.0|Do women need to read this? Seriously; if there is a guy, that you like, who is avoiding you, do you really need to read a book to figure out his motives? Common Sense Please!
0767819446|4.0|If you're into movies about alternate realties, this one's a definite must see. The story revolves around a murder but who is the killer and from where and which reality? Great acting, direction and plot developement. And an ending which won't leave you disappointed.
0393317552|2.0|Guns, Germs and Steel has little to do with Guns and Steel while it has much more to do with plant life, climate and livestock. <br /> <br />I found the information about the different climates, the origins of plants and different animal species to be very fascinating.  I read this book having recently returned from an extended visit to East Africa so I was intrigued by the breadth of data presented in it.  However, from the synthesis of this geographic data, the historical conclusions are entirely off base.  <br /> <br />I definitely agree with the author's premise that geographical assets are significant in the development of civilizations, but Mr. Diamond's leap from geographic assistance in development to historical mandate of dominance is weak.  If Mr. Diamond's assertions are to be believed, then clearly China should rule the world,(that chapter on the exemption of China was weak) if not them then India or one of the many mysterious North American civilizations. <br /> <br />As a student of Mexican and Native American history, I understand that guns had very little to do with the conquest of the Mexica and subjugation of the Aztec peoples.  The guns of the Castilian conquistadores weren't even guns at all, but were in fact clumsy arquebuses, weapons of limited range and efficiency. <br />Individually, the Castilian's best military advantage was probably the horse closely followed by their Toledo steel. Yet even armed with those weapons they still were very close to defeat on several occasions. In fact, all of the Conquistadores adopted Native American cotton armor because it was far superior. The primary reason they triumphed over the peoples in the Valley of Mexico was their clever use of politics and propaganda.   <br /> <br />Overlooked in the analysis of this book is the impact of significant people and significant movements. I understand that in American history, you take away Abraham Lincoln and we have two separate countries. Take away Genghis Khan, andthe peoples of Western Europe would probably be speaking Arabic. Take away Taoism and Confucianism from China and perhaps they throw the might of their civilization into agressive expansion.    <br /> <br />Basically, the book is fundamentally flawed because you can't neatly tidy up history into the sum of certain geographical circumstances.  To be fair, you can't also solely use religion or economics.  History is the combination of all of these elements and so much more.   It is entirely beyond me why this book is as lauded as much as it is today.  As a compendium of geographical, botanical and biological information there are no new revelations.  The historical assumptions derived from this information, despite your opinion of their validity are not new either.  Maybe its the glowing endorsement from Bill Gates?  After all, Rise of Nations (which lets you take on all these civilizations from the stone age to the computer age) soon came out after this book was published. Hmmmmmm
B000023VR6|5.0|Great album. The media thought that Dre fell off. But this album showed them that they were wrong. My fave tracks are \\"The Watcher\\", \\"F**k You\\" Featuring Devin 'The Dude' & Snoop Dogg, \\"Still D.R.E\\" Featuring Snoop Dogg, \\"Xxplosive\\" Featuring Kurupt & Nate Dogg, \\"What's The Difference\\" Featuring Eminem & Xzibit, \\"Forgot About Dre\\" Featuring Eminem, \\"Next Episode\\" Featuring Snoop Dogg & Nate Dogg, \\"B**ch N***az\\" Featuring Snoop Dogg, \\"Murder Ink.\\", \\"Some L.A. N***az\\" Featuring Defari & MC Ren, \\"Housewife\\" Featuring Kurupt & \\"The Message\\" Featuring Mary J. Blige. Overall, this album is definitely worth having in your collection.
B00005B36H|5.0|This is the best album ever made, period. The only album that will ever be better is their next one, because Tool is constantly evolving and magically getting even better.    There is absolutely no point in comparing Tool to other bands. They aren't prog-metal. They sound nothing like Dream Theater, Yes, Rush, Pink Flloyd, The Who, or whoever else you want to compare them to or say is better than them. They are completely isolated in their brilliance and this album is the best and most awe-inspiring effort they've given us yet.    Danny Carey is the star of this band because he is UNFATHOMABLY talented. Given his occult beliefs, it's not hard to see that there's something different going on here. If you've ever gotten the chance to SEE the man drum, you'd know that his movements are almost Hermetic and highly ritualistic. Paired with the fact that he has a college degree in percussion and also studies Indian tabla rhythm intensly, there's just no other drummer who sounds anything remotely like him. There's people who are technically as good (they're few and far between) but no one plays drums the way Danny Carey does.    The other members of the band build off of Danny's explosive, elongated, elusive, complex rhythms. Justin Chancellor is a pro at mimicking Danny's drumming, and coming up with beautiful and intersting bass lines. Adam Jones fills in the music with distorted and heavy guitars, non-complex and drifting, leaving space for Maynard James Keenan's intensly beautiful voice and lyrics. He never overcompensates and seems to understand that Tool is a bottom heavy band.    Listening to Lateralus is like listening to a sermon in notes. Tool is a musical religion. Ethereal, elusive, mysterious, occult, hallucinagenic, transcendental, supernatural, experimental, beautiful, scary, spiritual, mystical, ritualistic are just a FEW of the words i could use to describe Tool and Lateralus.    These guys are geniuses. And anyone who disputes that is either ignorant, jaded, closed-minded or a jealous HATER.
B000002J1U|5.0|This album is highly underrated and has many different song styles, so i will just list the songs. <br /> <br />Imagrant Song- A short, sweet and to the point headbanging song that is about the Vikings.    10/10 <br /> <br />Friends- Hard rocking acoustic song, proves that acoustic guitars are just as hard rocking as electrics.   10/10 <br /> <br />Celebration Day- A funny little song with a funny little riff, it dosn't get 10 because it fades out when robert plant is still singing 8/10 <br /> <br />Since Ive Been Loving You- A long, long, loooooooooonnnnnnnnnnnngggggg..... blues song that i dont like at all.  4/10 <br /> <br />Out on the tiles- A great heavy metal song with a tricky guitar riff.  10/10 <br /> <br />Gallows pole- This is an acoustic folk song and you might think it sounds boring, but it gets severely rocking about halfway through.  One of led zep's most underrated songs.  11/10 <br /> <br />Tangerine- A short folk ballad. Thats all.  9/10 <br /> <br />Thats the way- A long folk ballad.  7/10 <br /> <br />Bron-y-Aur Stomp- The name says it all- stomp.  Great acoustic folk-rock song.  11/10 <br /> <br />Hats off to roy harper- A completely stupid song that was problably put on this album as a filler song. Listen to it though, it is kinda funny!  6/10 <br /> <br />All in all This album is very good and i would say it is better than IV because IV is so overrated and pretty much everyone knows most of the songs on it.
B000001FSU|5.0|clearly the leaders of the east side thrash movement,anthrax had covered a lot of ground by 88s \\"state of euphoria\\".most of which were solid efforts & classic albums.here though, anthrax realy feel each other out,fine tuning the speedbump crusher.they also matured a bit lyricaly.i think its their best ever, that includes \\"persistance..\\" & j. bush stuff.i agree w/ what another review said about \\"antisocial\\".i could've done w/out it,but that was their radio song.

B00008S2VG|1.0|Madonna is the most talentless and boring 'fake' in the history of popular music. She makes Britney Spears look like Joni Mitchell. There isn't much more to say about it.
B0000DBJDM|5.0|Im a huge Pink Floyd fan, and when i first got this DVD, I can honestly say it ruled my life.  I would think about it all day, rush home from work to hear my favorite parts, and then keep the thing going for the rest of the day.  Classic live versions of Echoes and One of These Days are great and the cinematography is outstanding.  I never write reviews unless its for something Im extremely passionate about.  If you are on the fence about buying this DVD, trust me, you will not be dissappointed.
0930289234|5.0|I just finished reading perhaps one of the best works of literature i've ever laid eyes upon. And it was a graphic novel.<br /><br />Most people criticize comics as the stuff of adolescent boys, something that dreams and fantasies are made of. Watchmen is different. It was written way back in 1986, so its by far nothing new. Even so, Watchmen has a definite adult theme (when i say 'graphic' novel, i don't just mean pictures), and im sure most people would have little trouble getting into it. The themes of humanity and philosophy are better than most books that Ive read.<br /><br />Watchmen takes place in 1985, mostly in New York. In 1977, an act was passed banning all 'vigilantes'...but you can call them superheros. So, years later, all of the retired superheros are busy carrying out a normal, every day life. That is, until October 12th, 1985, when a former comrade, Edward Blake \\"The Comedian\\", is brutally murdered. The only one still acting as a Vigilante, Rorschach (Roor-shark), suspects something and begins to investigate. Rorschach begins to piece together a mystery that he dubs the \\"Mask Killer\\" as more vigilantes are killed. The most powerful superhero, Jon \\"Dr. Manhattan\\", is exiled from planet earth (Jon is the only superhero in the book with the typical superhuman powers, everyone else is decidedly human) and then things take a serious turn south. World war three looms near as Russian troops invade Afghanistan and the threat of full scale nuclear war seems very real. Rorschach still believes his theory that the killings and war are connected, but has a tough time convincing his fellow vigilantes. The tension mounts very quickly as the chapters unfold.<br /><br />Thats the basic story, but theres plenty more to it. There is TONS of depth to the characters, each one has his or her back story explained thoroughly. This book has everything from immense personal conflicts to political dilemmas. The storytelling is just flat out amazing, through the cunning use of flashbacks and alternate themes, its seems very much like an extremely well directed movie. There are plenty of details to watch for in many of the panels, and writers Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons make sure to bring past occurrences up again and again...there isn't a wasted scene in the book. I was blown away at just how everything was so thought out. The characters are memorable too, and are all very human, something most superhero stories lack. Rorschach is now my favorite superhero, and you'll see why after a few pages with this mysterious, bad ass, masked, monotone figure. Everything about this book is just awesome...no wonder it won the Hugo Award in 1988, the prestigious Science Fiction award that the likes of Orson Scott Card have won.<br /><br />Sure there are better drawn comics out there, but few things can match Watchmen's storytelling, story, characters, and presentation. As the back of the book reads, \\"This is the book that changed an industry and challenged a medium. If you've never read a graphic novel, then Watchmen is the one to start with. And even if you have, it's time to read it again.\\"<br /><br />I don't know how to say just how good this really is, Watchmen is beyond a 10/10.<br /><br />Highly Recommended.<br /><br />OH, and it's now being made into a major motion picture! Directed by Paul Greengrass (Bourne Supremacy) and screenplay by our very own Solid Snake...David Hayter. Hayter's screenplay is said to be the best comic book-to-screen adaptation ever. I cant wait!
B000003CKH|5.0|Oh no.  Alright.  Here it comes.  There it goes. <br /> <br />Best album of the nineties. <br /> <br />Ya! <br /> <br />Ya! <br /> <br />Ya! <br />
B0002S947K|5.0|I first heard the song \\"Shelter\\" on my XM radio at work and was instantly attracted to the stripped down, soulful, but very tuneful sound.  I downloaded and burned \\"Trouble\\" from Itunes and have listened to it since almost to the exclusion of everything else.  I am attracted to this record in a similar way as I was to \\"White Ladder\\" by David Gray, but it sounds more authentic and soulful.  I read the review on Amazon.com and was surprised to see Ray Lamontagne's reference to the song \\"Treetop Flyer\\" as an inspiration, as that is a favorite song of mine.  His voice is reminiscent of Stephen Stills with its raspy and folksy quality.  This recored is highly recommended (especially the 1st three tunes) and I hope he has many more records to come!
0790733900|5.0|I have just seen this movie again after many years. It is great to see Paul Newman at his best in a movie released in 1967 which was filmed about 38 years ago. This is one of the movies that made him so famous.<br /><br />Luke is sent to prison into a chain gang for a petty crime. He finds himself in a very strict, brutal and crushing prison system. The story is about his incredible bravery as he tries in spirit and in actuality to battle back from being brutalized by the guards. In the end, he only makes it out of the prison in spirit. His prison escapes fail.
B00005JNBQ|2.0|I was looking forward to this little piece of historic film making.  Had it on #1 on my Netflix queue, timed the DVD 2 be there on Monday AND Tuesday.  Got the email: \\"For Wednesday Napolean Dynamite\\"  I was excited.  Of course it means it will be there on Tuesday.  Got it.  Popped that puppy in!  Kicked back with a bathtub full of popcorn cuz I knew I was about 2 laugh my goofy A$$ OFF!!!!  First thing that was an indication of the level of intelligence needed 2 watch this movie?  WHINING!  I smirked in ONE part of this movie and it had nothing 2 do with Napolean.  The Uncle Chico...Rico...Pico...whatever his name was, was somewhat funny.  So after getting through watching MTV make what in their mind was the worst possible nerd ever.  But you can tell it was done by the original MTV Generation cuz this Napolean was based on nerds in the 80's.  And that is when this movie takes place.  Why in the 80's?Acting was bad, almost every person in this movie had a self pity all over the place.  Almost everyone was the same character.  Tater Tots in jeans?  I tried several times to like this movie and it has all been the same IT SUCKS!!  Yeah maybe if you are an MTV junkie either in the past or now, and laugh at the same drone duplicated in 10 characters, no jokes, no real plot but u like laughing at characters that are made up in Hollywood??? WATCH REVENGE OF THE NERDS!  If I could travel through time I would go back and punch myself in the nose (cuz nose hurts the most) before I wasted my time seeing this.  Good LUCK!!
B0000041Q3|4.0|This Turandot set, most likely the most popular of all the Turandots, is an amazing set to own.  However, there are a few things about it which I would particularly disagree with.  First, there's the subject of Calaf.  Although Pavarotti has an amazing voice and sings Calaf to near perfection, he doesn't come quite close to the Calaf of Corelli's ballpark.  Corelli not only sang the role of Calaf wonderfully, but also with passion and emotion not seen in any other Calaf after his career.  His Non Piangere Liu, easily the best of all the released Turandots, will bring you to tears.  Dame Joan, however, is a good Turandot, and sometimes her voice is much creamier than that of Nilsson.  One objection only: I don't like the phaser trill of her voice when she combines coloratura with dramatic notes, something that shouldn't be done in Turandot.  Caballe is easily the greatest Liu on record, one of the many reasons why this recording should NEVER be missed.  Listen to Signore Ascolta and her death scene, and you will realize what kind of soprano Puccini tailored the role of Liu for.  The late Ghiaurov is an amazing Timur, very passionate although he cannot be compared with Niccola Zaccaria.  Mehta is a grand conductor, I should say, and even though this record has a few flaws, I would recommend it for those who want a glimpse of Puccini's swan song.
B00000DHZJ|5.0|For an artist that only made a handful of (admittedly remarkable) albums, there are a lot of albums that seemingly bear his name.  From the 'Family Authorised albums/box-sets, through to bootleg, barely audible cash-in's, hoping to snag an unsuspecting listener.  It can be a little bit of a 'Mine-Field' trying to buy a good Hendrix Compilation. <br /> <br />If (like me), you want a nice tidy summary of his best work, without having to run out and pick up individual albums (which in theory, we really should do), then you'd be seriously hard pressed to find a better Single-CD Jimi Hendrix compilation than this. <br /> <br />Unsurprisingly, It collects the majority of his better known Hard-Rock, Psychedelic Rock tracks:  (Fire, Crosstown traffic, Purple Haze) with their swaggering, energetic & cathartic guitar excesses that made his music such a unique prospect, but also handpicks tracks from his best studio albums \\"Electric Ladyland\\" (\\"All along the Watchtower\\", \\"Voodoo Child (slight return)\\", \\"Crosstown Traffic\\"), and possibly his most regarded album \\"Are you experienced?\\" (\\"The wind cries Mary\\",\\" Manic Depression\\",\\"Red House\\").  along with various other lesser-known, but no less worthy tracks (\\"Bold as love\\", \\"Dolly Dagger\\", \\"Castles made of sand\\"). <br /> <br />Something else that should be mentioned, is the layout of the track listing, which (along with the sound quality) is marvellous, and instead of lining up all the hits at the beginning of the album.  The compliers have wisely spaced the hits out, over the course of the album, interspersing the hits amongst the immediately less familiar work, which makes for a far more evened listening experience. <br /> <br />But this wouldn't be a balanced review without some criticism....so, it's necessary to bemoan the fact that this compilation only has 20 tracks!!???  (coooome on!!, a lot more could have been added to this compilation!??, although the last couple of tracks are taken from the 'First Rays of the New RisingSun' album, that wasn't completed before his death).  And there are a couple of tracks whose exclusion is baffling.  Why no.... \\"Are you Experienced?\\", \\"Voodoo Chile\\", 1983...(A Merman I should turn to be), \\"Manic Depression\\"??? <br /> <br />For serious Jimi Hendrix Fans, there's nothing here that, you won't have heard or seen 'repackaged 100 times before.  But then again, this compilation wasn't devised with you in mind.  This was designed for those of us, that like/love Mr Hendrix, and never got around to buying an album, and on that basis, it's a complete triumph, and will delight anyone that just wants all the hits in one tidy place.  Although saying that.....listening to this has now made me want to go and buy: \\"Electric Ladyland\\" & \\"Are you experienced?\\", so beware!!!
630471193X|4.0|Who would have imagined that John Travolta could do a Jimmy Stewart impression? At times though, I felt a strong resemblance - especially with the gentle, bemused Stewart of \\"Mr Smith goes to Washington\\" or \\"The Man Who Shot Liberty Vallance\\". Even the name \\"George Malley\\" fits, and the two birthday parties held under very different circumstances.<br /><br />The challenge of imagining what it would be like to be hyper-intelligent has defeated a lot of writers. How could we know, after all? How could a chimp grasp the thoughts that go through the average human mind? This movie does quite a good job of handling this problem, but it really zooms in on the difficulty of finding a role in life when all your friends look at you in awe (or downright fear) and even the government sees you as a security risk.<br /><br />It's not very exciting, but it is emotional and thought-provoking. And surprisingly funny, in an unassuming way. A great way to spend a quiet, reflective evening that will give you plenty of food for thought. Probably best avoided by Quentin Tarantino fans, though.
B0000A118M|5.0|The four major spiritual works of art and/or literature since the beginning of history are as follows:  The Bible, the painting of the Last Supper, Handel's Messiah, and A Love Supreme.    The first time I heard \\"Resolution\\" (the second part of the suite) I experienced the entire range of human emotions in the first twenty seconds of the piece.  Scenes from my life flashed before my eyes in rapid succession.  It wasn't a near death experience, but a spiritual reaction to an amazing piece of music. The intense outpouring of emotion is a big part of the reason this recording is revered as much as it is.     The rest of the suite is equally amazing.  McCoy Tyner is a standout performer on this recording, turning in excellently conceived solos as well as those beautiful suspended fourth chords. The excellent rhythm section of Elvin Jones and Jimmy Garrison lays down the pulse that makes the music breathe as though it is a living thing.       My opinion is that this is the greatest jazz album ever recorded. It is my favorite;  Coltrane definitely communicated on this one.
0767834739|2.0|I have to admit I loved the first film.  It was one of the few films that I thought best represented the video game that it accompanied.  Milla was perfectly cast as the lead and the non-linear structure of the film allowed us to see the who, what, where, when, and why of the events.  There was just the right amount of terror, the right amount of action, and a whole bunch of originality.  I wish, I really wish that I could say the same about it sequel.  As the credits rolled and we were brought back up to speed from the last events that occurred in the original only to discover that a new director had decided to helm this project and was obviously handed more money and forced to follow the footsteps of Hollywood.  Everything from the original was lost and discarded as a mainstream horror film with maybe zombies (couldn't tell due to the blurry nature of which they ran) moved in to take its place.  More money was on the table with, in this case, meant more explosions and less story.  A disgrace to the name of both the video game and the original film came in several ways with this inferior sequel, mainly horrible acting, cliched characters, a recycled plot, and especially with a amateurish, craft sale created monster known as the Nemesis.<br /><br />To begin the characters were very disrespectful to the original.  I remember hearing of this sequel and hoping they would build more on Milla character, giving her more to work with and more past stories of her time at the Umbrella Corporation.  I was a hopeful viewer who wished for more deeply rooted characters with many layers, but found the Hollywood clich&eacute; instead.  The entire character known as LJ could have been eliminated with the greatest of ease and without any remorse.  His lines were the epitome of every other zombie film created while trying to bring his own game references into a franchise that was doing well on its own (the GTA line nearly took my rage over the top).  Like any good supporter of films and video games, I don't mind when they bring in more characters from the series, but let us know who they are first.  There was no introduction to Valentine for those less familiar with the series other than she knows how to shoot zombies and she was disbarred from the force (see the writing on the wall).  This goes the same for Carlos, who just wandered through his part without really contributing anything worth while, and Nicholai, whom I always considered another villain of the series.  Oh well, I guess when tons of Hollywood cash is being thrown in your direction, you can just go crazy with creativity and forget the basis of your film.  Yet again, who am I to say?  Milla was the only one worth watching in this entire film, and even her character seemed to be turning to cardboard by the end.  It was a sad change of events for the Resident Evil group.<br /><br />The bad acting was the only trouble with this film, the horrible script allowed the Hollywood character and plot clich&eacute;s to pour in like the flood gates had been opened.  The wise cracking character that always has something to say and obscure pop culture references that try to gain a couple laughs from the audience was present.  The no-nonsense female cop that has a strange past, but finds out that she has the heart of gold.  The corporation boss that is willing to kill everyone for the sake of science and proves that he has no heart what so ever.  Finally, there is the large overbearing monster that was nothing more than table scraps of every other Hollywood big budget horror movie, which discovers the true meaning of Christmas.  YUK.  Could director Alexander Witt either not do his homework or just try for once to build upon the original instead of slicing and dicing.  Not just the characters were clich&eacute;, but also the story.  Lines were replaced with explosions and CGI.  Gore replaced the sci-fi element and 1984 Big Brother moments were just the mother load.  Seriously, I would love to know what happened.<br /><br />I would like to end this review by saying that I laughed at Nemesis the entire time it was on screen.  For any of you that did not, I question your sanity.  The reality, if that is what you want to call it, the creative imagination of the original was lost when Nemesis made his screen debut.  It was sloppy and cheap.  Definitely not something for Witt to be proud of.<br /><br />Overall, this was not a crowning achievement for the series.  The themes were jumbled mess of save humanity and science is bad.  Milla did the best with what she was handed providing some of the better parts of the film, but everyone else were just worthless.  I hope that the makers of this film see the error in their ways and the fact that they completely butchered a great concept.  Video games are an amazing source of imagination, but sometimes when Hollywood money becomes involved, you get projects like Resident Evil: Apocalypse.  I loved the video games, but after the original, this series needs to tighten up to regain control.<br /><br />Grade: ** out of *****d. <br /> <br />I would like to end this review by saying that I laughed at Nemesis the entire time it was on screen.

6301966562|5.0|My VHS copy is hardly watchable anymore. It's one of those feel good romantic comedies with a definite 80's feel. Virginia Madsen is soooo! delicious in this and Bud Cort (Harold & Maude)was the perfect choice for the A.I. Antagonist's voiceover. <br />Please, you obviously have an audience make it a good transfer in Widescreen.
B0000AGQ6Z|5.0|This movie is by far one the greatest of all films. This is largely due in part to its superior screenplay and dialogue. The movie is loaded with various motiffs and symbols. The overall theme of the movie is the psychological transformation of T.E. Lawrence. The switch of personalities between Lawrence and Ali is all too apparent. Lawrence after all, suffers an identity crisis throughout the film. Lawrence first starts off as a humble soldier. Once he undergoes his mission to \\"appreciate the situation\\" he states that he will accomplish a \\"miracle\\" which he eventually does. From there he compares himself to Moses as he crosses Sinai. He eventually goes so far as to compare himself to Christ as he walks in splendor and transfigured white on top of the train. He shortly thereafter states that he will \\"walk on water\\". He however not only comes back down to earth, but he sinks to the bottom, covered with mud and filth after his rape by the Turks. He even goes so far as to cover himself with a filthy cloak. He however cannot cover the bloody scars on his back (this is about as close to Christ as he gets), which are a result of the Turks' torture.     I will not proceed to describe the rest of the deep elements of the movie. Just bare in mind that the movie begins with a motorcycle and ends with one. The more you see the film the more you will love and understand it. It is this quality which sets movies apart. Those who claim the movie is boring are those who do not \\"appreciate the situation\\". They need to read more literature.
B000002LTV|5.0|I can't believe that I bought this cd almost 13 years ago. It's still great and I've just introduced it to someone this year and they plan to buy it.
B0006IIPIK|3.0|\\"Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow\\" is a visual treat, the kind of film that advances the visual state of the art, and it's a blast. But, as other films that also advanced the state of the art remind us  - \\"Fantastic Voyage,\\" \\"Earthquake,\\" \\"Logan's Run,\\" \\"Tron,\\" and even \\"Final Fantasy\\" come to mind - it takes more than cool visuals to make a truly great movie. <br /> <br />What it takes is emotional resonance, and that's what \\"Sky Captain\\" lacks. Emotional resonance is the reason why films like \\"The Wizard of Oz,\\" \\"Star Wars,\\" and \\"Raiders of the Lost Ark\\"  - all of which are obvious influences here - are still great, even after the state of the visual art passed them by. In those classic films, the human element shines through the technology; in \\"Sky Captain,\\" the humanity seems a bit lost. <br /> <br />Not that \\"Sky Captain\\" doesn't try, with terrific actors, and some frequently fun and snappy dialogue. Perhaps it's no coincidence that the most recent \\"Star Wars\\" movies, which, like \\"Sky Captain,\\" were all largely shot in front of green screens and had the environments \\"digitized,\\" also don't make much of an emotional impact either. Perhaps actors are more \\"real\\" in a \\"real\\" environment. <br /> <br />But \\"Sky Captain\\" has its moments, from the gorgeous rendition of 1930's New York, to wildly imaginitive visual elements like bombers with wings that flap like a bird's, to giant airships that serve as floating airbases. This is all truly visionary stuff, and it's executed with real panache, but it's done without making a real emotional connection with the audience.  <br /> <br />You have to give the director, Kerry Conran, props for visual originality, and for the way this film was brought to the big screen (hey, there's hope for all us frustrated filmmakers, I guess), and hope that his next effort will make that next great leap into a film with real emotional impact. Conran has that kind of film in him, if Hollywood will give him another shot.
0375703861|3.0|But it didn't start out that way.  A little less than a third of the book is what I was easily able to get through.  The writing was very good, it flowed, it was very witty and enjoyable.  But once the plot went into one large flashback of the lives of two of the main characters' time in the war I just lost interest.  It became pretty boring, almost like someone else had taken over the story and was writing it.  I really didn't care about those two characters anymore, I think that flashback really bogged down the story, though it might have been essential to the later plotline, I really don't know now :)  But I was bored with it and stopped forcing myself to read.  Not my thing I guess.
B0002O0CM0|2.0|3 July 1971 is a day indelibly etched within my mind. After spending the night fantasizing about a Vietnamese chambermaid at a cheap Paris hotel, my friend and traveling companion, Mike Minzer (Paris Records), and I headed to Gard du Nord on the morning of July 3 to catch a train to Madrid... whereupon  we somehow became separated for several of the oddest weeks of my life. Oh yeah... another American in Paris died that morning.    <br /> <br />From my perspective the Doors could do no wrong. They released little material I didn't like. They had magic; and, Jim Morrison was chief brujo. But, the Doors were more than Jim Morrison so I thought that after 3 decades I should investigate, finally, the two post-Morrison releases... conveniently issued on a single CD. <br /> <br />It was no so much disappointment or dreadful music... it simply was not The Doors. Actually, several Other Voices cuts such as Ships With Sails and In the Eye of the Sun exhibited the expected Doorsian texture. However, that rich Morrison aureole, the aura that so characterized The Doors, was missing... things seemed flat and rather lackluster. Within Full Circle, plays like The Peking King and the New York Queen strut some old Doors attitude but much of the album takes on new directions as evidenced by The Piano Bird. Poor Jimmy dead and gone... no one left to sing his song... <br /> <br />
B00000C3G6|5.0|I owned the original vinyl years ago and recently purchased the cd.  As many have said,this is a true masterpiece.  Every song is one to enjoy and savor.  I have always enjoyed their music  over the years and this recording is no exception.  I would highly recommend adding to your music collection.
B0000041LL|4.0|Such complete works as this - spanning the composer's lifetime - make for an excellent study in the composer's musical evolution.  Although termed \\"early\\" works, Beethoven's first Op. 18 Quartets were composed when he was around thirty, having dozens of brilliant compositions behind him.  These first quartets show both the 'restrained' classical forms and mannerisms of Haydn but with notable evolutions like the introduction of deeply emotional and tragic writing (the slow movement of the No. 1 for example).      The \\"middle period\\" quartets (op. 59, 74, 95) shows Beethoven at his most \\"Heroic\\" style composing broad, sweeping, and increasing complex part writing - so much that the fickle Viennese audiences used to Haydn's and Mozart's classical style were not quite sure what to think of them.      Even more abstract to audiences (outside Beethoven's quartet friends) were the late works (Op. 127, 130-135) which progress to totally new ideas, sounds and organization.  These included unusual, frequent and unexpected shifts in dynamics, tempo and key modulations.  But most historic was an intangible emotive quality Beethoven introduced to music which might be termed \\"spirituality.\\"  What is most amazing is that these musical revolutions all were developed when in Bethoven's final years lived in a state of sadness, illness, deafness and isolation.  Yet, having a lifetime of notes and music in his head, his composing skills were not limited at all by this deafness but perhaps even more focused.  With their highly evolutionary form and spiritual nature, the late quartets are in a category of their own and have provoked many an analysis as to their meaning and connection to Beethoven's final years.    The Quartetto Italiano show why they were a legendary quartet in the 60's and 70's with a remarkable performance of great depth here.  Complementing them is a vibrant Philips recording in spite of its 60's heritage.  The sound is very good but just a little shy of depth and richness as compared to the modern DDD recordings like the new Takacs recordings (but absolutely nothing to deter purchase).  Their playing is masterful, dramatic and probing - all while maintaining their characteristic smooth and emotive style that has endeared them for generations.  However, in some movements it seems the Italians don't quite find the right flow and essence and sound stagnated compared to others (the e-minor Op. 59 for one).      Other notable quartets for these works include the Takacs, Emerson, Busch, Vegh, Talich, Alban Berg and Lindsay Quartets.  All the above are rated 3/3 stars by Penguin Guide, so competion is fierce and it really comes down to what stylistic nuances most appeal to you (Best to pick a set and focus on the intricacies of the music vs. comparing quartet A to B too much).  Other reviews below give some insights into the comparitive performance as each brings something different and insightful to the music.  My first choices would be the Takacs or Alban Berg.    But, as far as value and quality of performance, this neatly-packaged Philips complete set of 10 CD's is a good historic choice - although the superb Alban Berg set on EMI is a great value too.  The Takacs and Lindsay sets are the most expensive.  Compositions - 5 stars, Performance - 4 stars, Sound - 4 stars.
B00005JM02|5.0|For me this film is about as good as it gets, without being a surf movie.  The immense quality of the characters and underwater landscape is breathtaking.  You can watch it over and over again.
B0002Z1EG2|5.0|This Greatest Hits record is truly that, an album packed with GREAT HITS! <br />Shania is one of the few genuine artists left in the world and it comes as no surprise that she is arguably the most successful female artist of all time! <br />All of Shania's albums are packed with great, strong, single worthy songs, Shania never wastes album space with \\"filler\\" tracks so technically all of her albums would qualify as a \\"Greatest Hits\\" CD. <br />It must have been hard choosing the tracklisting when you have so many great songs to pick from but Shania managed to pick the GREATEST from the GREAT, all of her best songs are on here and Shania even managed to give us 3 brand new wonderful songs to go along with that! <br />Shania makes truly great music and she is ALWAYS well worth your money, guaranteed!
B00008S2VG|2.0|I'd like to start by simply saying \\"I feel bad for Madonna.\\"  Why does she feel like she still has something to prove?  For god's sake, she's Madonna- She has nothing to prove.  Yet with &lt;u>American Life&lt;/u>, Madonna seems as though she is determined to finally be taken seriously.  Instead of being taken seriously, Madonna ends up being taken as an angry, bitter, and pretentious artist, who feels that she has free range to say pretty much whatever she wants on American culture, and how she became famous. <br /> <br />The album opener, which is also the title track, is a simple cacophony to listen to.  Where Music, the song, was upbeat and fun, American Life (also in reference to the song) is morbid and depressing.  It's no surprise that it got almost no radio play (considering the artist it was coming from).  The second song on the album, which was also the second (and rush-released) single, Hollywood, is also on the rather dark side, where Madonna snubs her nose at the Hollywood life, and looks down on at it from an almost omnipotent point of view.  Hollywood also got virtually no radio play, failing to even make a dent in the Billboard Hot 100. <br /> <br />By the time the album concludes, one finds themselves asking \\"Why?\\" yet again.  Why Madonna?  Why so angry?  Why the abandonment of the country which is present in your album title?  Why remain with the same sound you have been dabbling with for over 5 years, when you have built your career on changing your sound? <br /> <br />If you are looking for a better Madonna album that has something along the lines of the same sound, try &lt;u>Music&lt;/u>, the precursor to &lt;u>American Life&lt;/u>.  Hopefully the rumors of Madonna having a new album in the works are true, so she can redeem herself from this stumbling blunder. <br />
B000002I27|4.0|next to the doors' self titled album, this one is probally the best.  Jim Morrison is truly \\"an american poet\\" and some of his best work is on this cd. my favorite, lyric-wise, is probally 'cant see your face in my mind'. i definetly recommend this cd.
B0000028M7|5.0|Alice Chains is easily the best grunge band from Seattle and &quot;Dirt&quot; is one of the most UNDERRATED albums in the history of music.  If you like Metallica's 80's albums and complain that the 90's is horrible your absolutely right but Alice In Chains is an exception.  &quot;Dirt&quot; is very aggressive, dark lyrics, and the combination of Layne Staley and Jerry Cantrell is unstoppable.  The album is very versitile with lighter songs like &quot;Rooster&quot; and then AIC's heavier stuff which keeps the listener paying close attention.  What makes &quot;Dirt&quot; so great though is the fantastic finish it has.  There's &quot;Angry Chair&quot; which is my personal favorite with a very cool tune and then &quot;Dirt&quot; ends with the classic hit &quot;Would?&quot;.  AIC is unique with how the vocals blend right into the music itself, not to mention the fact that they are very intense.
0316172324|2.0|I am a great admirer of Malcolm Gladwell's writing, having read him for years in \\"The New Yorker\\" and loving \\"The Tipping Point,\\" his earlier book.  But \\"Blink\\" is no \\"Tipping Point.\\"    The idea here is that people often have intuitive first impressions that are more valid and valuable than carefully considered, well-thought-out, researched conclusions.  Except when they aren't, because first impressions of individuals, for example, can be clouded by (and Gladwell even discusses this) such matters as attractiveness, gender, race -- and even height (what Gladwell calls the \\"Warren Harding\\" error).  And how are we to know when our quick-as-a-blink reaction is valid and when it isn't?  Well, that's the problem with the book.  Ever experienced love-at-first-sight and then realized the person wasn't really everything you thought s/he was...?    This entire book flies in the face of an excellent article Gladwell wrote in 2000 called \\"The New-Boy Network\\" [...] about how worthless the typical job interview is (because it relies too much on gut impressions) and how \\"structured interviews\\" are the only worthwhile ones (an excerpt from the article: \\"This interviewing technique is known as \\"structured interviewing,\\" and in studies by industrial psychologists it has been shown to be the only kind of interviewing that has any success at all in predicting performance in the workplace. In the structured interviews, the format is fairly rigid. Each applicant is treated in precisely the same manner. The questions are scripted. The interviewers are carefully trained, and each applicant is rated on a series of predetermined scales.\\")    Even examples he uses in this book are not very on-target, such as the Red/Blue military exercise he spends a considerable amount of time discussing.  He implies repeatedly that the victory of the Reds was due to thin-slicing and their quick judgments, but by his own description a lot of well-thought-out strategic decisions about communications, etc.,really were at the heart of the victory, not intuitive decisions made in the blink of an eye.    On the other site of the intuition vs. analysis coin, a very good read is Michael Lewis's \\"Moneyball.\\"  Central to that book, with applications well beyond its baseball setting, is the realization that the gut reactions of seasoned baseball scouts are often unreliable, being clouded by how a player looks rather than his actual on-field accomplishments.  A more analytical approach has helped Oakland make the playoffs repeatedly with a salary a third (now a quarter) that of the Yankees -- and also was at the heart of general manager Theo Epstein's player moves that helped the Red Sox win the World Series.    Gladwell certainly loves the social sciences, and runs all over the landscape discussing various experiments, theories, etc., but it doesn't really come together here like it did in \\"The Tipping Point,\\" or in many of his articles.  My \\"thin slice\\" (as Gladwell would say):  a disappointment.
B000021YQV|5.0|I think this album couldn't get any better than this.  Even their other albums as well you can listen to them front to back and still listen to it again.  Rock on System Fans..... I know you love their albums.
0451529065|4.0|I recommend reading of this book because of the importance of it.  When Charles Darwin published this in 1859 it rocked the English speaking world.  Up to that point the religious idea of creation was unquestionably accepted.  Religion held a lot of power over people and their lives.  Then this book came out, and it put into question all that the English world held dear about God and creation.  I don't know if any piece of literature has had such a profound affect on society and its beliefs.  When I read it, I thought that it might be boring because of the scope of the work, but it's actually not boring because it's simply and plainly written.  Remember the whole theory of evolution originated from this one work.
0062502182|5.0|Following one's destiny may be one of the most difficult journeys one may end up taking in their lives.  Many people keep saying that they will follow their dreams, but end up pushing them aside to live a regular life.  In the novel, The Alchemist, by Paulo Coelho, it was unmistakable that determination and ambition will motivate those who want to pursue their dreams, and will persuade those who hold off their dreams to go and chase them.  This is an enchanting tale that will help people reflect upon the meaning of life, in a touching and meaningful manner.  <br />  <br />The story is of a young Andalusian shepherd by the name of Santiago, who left home to travel the world with his faithful flock of sheep.  He had an unusual dream in which he saw himself come across hidden treasure in the mystic pyramids of Egypt.  Santiago decided to leave it all in order to pursue a life changing journey in search of the magnificent treasure.  <br />  <br />After wandering throughout various regions of Spain, Santiago arrived at a town called Tarifa, where he met a king that told him that he had discovered his destiny and that he should pursue in finding the treasure, by following omens.  Santiago decided to leave his native land and search for the treasure that just seemed to be destined for him.   <br /> <br />Upon his arrival in Africa, Santiago was confronted with many obstacles such as not speaking the language or understanding the Arabic traditions.  Lonely and discouraged, the shepherd was about to give up and return back to his land, where he would be accepted and happy.  However, seeing the importance of following dreams, Santiago decided that, \\"When you want something, all the universe conspires in helping you to achieve it.\\"  Using this piece of advice, Santiago went on to help others who were on the verge of giving up their dreams and continued on the path towards his treasure, when he met an alchemist.   <br /> <br />The alchemist he encountered helped Santiago realize the Language of the World, the Soul of the World, and many other various parts of life that made Santiago better understand his life and his goals.  In the end, it was Santiago's wisdom and relation to the world that he got to accomplish his dream of finding the treasure, which happened to be the journey he took to see the Pyramids.   <br /> <br />The Alchemist was a simple yet philosophical book that seemed to make one have a more abstract outlook on life.  Every page was full of spiritual consolation and the morals the novel presented were powerful and significant.  Some of the important messages Coelho was trying to convey were of following your dreams and trying to understand the meaning of life.   <br /> <br />Another thing Coelho was messaging was that, \\"One is loved because one is loved. No reason is needed for loving.\\"  This message, as plain as it may be, was one of the most genuine statements made throughout the whole story.  It gave a sense of how love was so natural for Santiago to understand and grasp, that it reflected the effect love provides to humans in general.   <br />The writing style was simplistic and beautiful.  \\"It's the simple things in life that are the most extraordinary; only wise men are able to understand them,\\" said the alchemist to Santiago.  A reader would probably appreciate that this novel was written in an uncomplicated manner so that one could have more value for the meaning of the ideas the author expressed.    <br /> <br />There was a lot of symbolism throughout the novel as well.  Omens represented optimism for Santiago and encouraged him to fulfill his dreams.  Many of the lessons learned in The Alchemist can be related to the real world and applied to everyone's life.  This book does a good job of touching hearts through its poetic flow and inspiring messages.   <br /> <br />As striking as the story was, the only thing that would need more improvement would be the development of the characters.  One would probably feel that they could relate to Santiago through the experiences he went through, but there wasn't much depth in his desires and thoughts, apart from repeated information over and over again.  The repetition was beneficial to reinstitute the messages Coelho was conveying, yet that resulted in little advancement of the characters.  Other than that, The Alchemist was wonderful in its simplistic beauty and gripping messages. <br /> <br />I completely recommend this book, because it's a coming of age book that will help people appreciate the little things in life and encourage those who have brushed aside their dreams, to once again get up and try again.  As Santiago declared upon being victorious in achieving his dreams, he said the words, \\"Life really is generous to those who pursue their destiny.\\"  These words should hearten people with inspiration to follow their dreams and live a life in which no one would have regrets.
B00005JMAH|4.0|This is the deepest, darkest, and probably the best Harry Potter movie so far. The problem I have with the film is not so much as what you would see on the screen, but what you see in the packaging. Warner Bros. has decided that they haven't made enough money on this franchise yet, and has scaled back their packaging from the nice paper cases to the standard cheap plastic.    Anyone who has a movie collection has got to be at least a little frustrated with the studio. Think what your DVD collection would look like with the first two LOTR extended edition DVD sets sitting next to ROTK in a cheap little plastic case. And why? So the studio could save a few cents on each one!?    (...)
B0000046ZJ|4.0|You get the impression from Stan's grinning face on the album and from the music that he seems to be having a great time. Too happy to be legal, perhaps. The Peterson group also meshes well and all seem to be enjoying themselves thuroughly, or prehaps infectiously. Peterson's piano accents without turf battles. Makes you wonder why they never recorded again. The background chatter (restricted to a few upbeat songs) is less irritating than when other performers do it...<br /><br />Best, of course, is the Ballad medley, *Bewitched, Bothered*, *Polkadots and Moonbeams*, where everyone gets a piece. Happy, cheerful *Pennies from Heaven* &amp; *Three Little Words* highlight Stan's lyrical side. *I'm glad there is You* is sensative. *Tour's End* is perky.<br /><br />Classic performance. Deserves a solid 3 1/2 stars on my tough grading system or higher, marked down from a higher grade by the somewhat murky, rolled-off mono sound. I know this was 1957, but Stan has earlier albums which were recorded better. Sound improves somewhat by the end of the album.
B00005JNBQ|4.0|This movie is a refreshing alternative to the standard format of over the top gross-out humor and language that has become standard in teen/20 something comedies.   <br /> <br />While movies like American Pie have their good points, the same old jokes and derivitive plots are getting tired.  In contrast, Napoleon Dynamite's sureal deadpan feels like a breath of fresh air.   <br /> <br />Although devoid of gross-out humor, everything about this movie was designed deliberately to make the viewer cringe.  Every character is their own brand of loser...not one is without glaring outward faults.  Every character is immersed in their own brand of misery, ridiculousness, and/or sense of dilusion. <br />   <br />Right smack in the middle of this hellish reality you have Napoleon, who at first glance seems the biggest loser of the lot.  However, by the end of the movie it becomes clear that it's not the case. <br /> <br />Rather than attempt to fit into what is at best a painful reality, Napoleon simply chooses to reject most of it and substitute his own.  In doing so, he creates an island within himself and a means to filter the world around him.  His blank expression reflects this well.   <br /> <br />In contrast to the apathy that he shows towards most of the world, Napoleon proves himself a good friend to to those he cares about, and capable of hate towards those whose adverse actions penetrate his ability to ignore them, or harm the ones he cares about.   <br /> <br />In the final scene, his impromtu \\"skit\\" in front of the school illuminates his character clearly.  Rather than see his friend let down, he intervenes without thought to himself.   <br /> <br />In a film with a diverse cast of losers, the ones that ultimately end up with a measure of happiness and redemption have two things in common:  <br /> <br />1) They recognise the core quality in the people they care about regardless of how others might percieve them. <br /> <br />2) The are able to live in a bubble oftheir own reality and shut out the rest.  <br /> <br />While a humor of film like this might be missed by some of its audience, it leaves the rest laughing out loud.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|at first glance this movie looks extremely lame, you have to watch it open  minded or else you wont like it.  You cant be asking what was the point in that or say i dont get it, cuz there is nothing to get. Once you understand that this movie is helarious and ive watched it about 10 times already! I highly highly reccomend this movie!!!

The author writes with such detail that the oils become alive with their own personalities.  The beginning is a brief explanation of Aromatherapy, Oriental medicine and Astrology.  This is followed by a wonderful Materia Medica with explanations of 37 oils.  Each oil is described in two pages which include a brief botanical description, ancient uses, oriental uses of a physical, emotional and spiritual nature, and an astrological description.  He gives suggestions for oils along with detailed explanations for nervous tension, overthinking and worry, anxiety and apprehension, poor concentration and memory, lack of confidence and self-esteem, anger and frustration, disempowerment and indecision, depression and negativity, and problems in relating.  I refer to this book often.
B0000648WZ|3.0|I hate this movie for several reasons but love it for others. That is why I decided to give it three stars. My reasons for liking it are few. I actually saw the movie before I read the book so I'm not a Heinlein zealot. I enjoyed the battle scenes simply for their scale and the Korean War element. I did find it ridiculous after a while seeing infantry with practically musket range weaponry with about the effectiveness being slaughtered by hordes of big Praying Mantises when a half dozen WWII vintage tanks could have finished things in about twenty minutes. <br /> <br />My anger comes from the so-called \\"satire\\" element in the film. Making certain elements of a novel seem silly is one thing but directly refutting them is another. Taking \\"liberties,\\" Verhoeven destroys the thesis of the entire book. His comment that an accurate adaptation would have been impossible is correct. However by his \\"adaptation\\" one wonders if he even read the novel. Basically he takes the enemy, the names of the some of the characters (and adapting their gender to his needs), and the name of the book for his movie. If they had taken the title off the book I wouldn't have made the connection between it and the movie other then by character names. Good book. Laughable movie.
038073186X|5.0|I've read everything by Lehane (though I found his series rather farfetched), and I definately liked Shutter Island the best. Yes, it's very different, but I really dig all the the twists and turns. It's great that he's trying something totally different. Not enough authors do.<br /><br />  This was the first book I read by Lehane, so I didn't know this at the time, but he didn't include his usual amazing, thought provoking prose that is plentiful in his other books, such as Mystic River.<br /><br />  Lehane has shown his proven his obvious talen for writing again and again. Now I hope he can write a book that is more realistic, or thought provoking, than his previous novels have been Patrick Kenzie novels have been, but also include his thought provoking style.
B0001LJC2K|5.0|I've never felt compelled to write a review online about a band but I've always enjoyed reading what others had to say about a particular band or album. That having been said this album is incredible.  Musicians only dream of creating a masterpiece such as this. The mesh of beautiful song writing and the heavy guitar hooks make for an exciting hour of listening too. A lot of people find gateway bands that open their ears to new music and new bands. Muse did that for me and I would recommend this album to anyone. Go out and buy this album and support the band, you won't be dissapointed.
B0001ADAVK|5.0|This doesn't have the best rating from the reviewers here on Amazon.com, but I think that it is a wonderful movie.  It has a strong story, some very beautiful scenes, a great cast, and an enjoyable soundtrack.  Katherine Watson, a bohemian from California, finally attains her dream; to teach at the highest ranked women's college in the country.  She soon comes to find that instead of preparing these women for the world, the institution is simply preparing them for marriage.  After coming to form extremely close bonds with some of the girls, and a rather rocky existance with others, the whole situation is wrapped up in a life altering experience that changes the way they all view the world.  Give this one a try.  Hopefully, you'll love it as much as I do.
B0006399FS|3.0|Reading other reviews, I found it interesting that some people compared U2 to Led Zeppelin particularly in regards to the disparity between the critics' claims and the pop-charts' reality.  Led Zeppelin's career was a bright flash in the pan compared to U2 - they only effectively lasted about a decade.  U2 is halfway through its THIRD decade of rock and roll.  An entire generation of people who grew up with U2 now have kids listening to U2.  Few other bands can make the same claim (e.g. The Rolling Stones).  As I listen to music on the radio these days, rarely does it have the same impact on me that music did when I was younger.  Is it because music these days isn't as good?  I doubt it.  The only thing that has truly changed is my age.  When I listen to songs like \\"Sometimes You Can't Make It on Your Own\\" and \\"City of Blinding Lights\\" and I get chills not because of their originality, but because of the ghosts of past hits they evoke.  If I were back in high school this album would no doubt be a \\"must have\\" for me.  Now I hear the singles and they make me want to go listen to Achtung Baby instead.<br /><br />Led Zeppelin was treated with a heavy hand in the `70's by music critics, yet they have survived to this day as one of the most popular rock bands with continuous air-play.  I was born in '74 when half of their career was already over.  When I began to appreciate good music, I bought every one of their albums -  I think they're that good.  I don't, however, own every U2 album, I own the ones from my formative years: War, Joshua Tree, Achtung Baby and Zooropa.  And that is the difference.  Will U2 have staying power?  Yes.  Are they still good?  Yes.  But they are not the same as the Gods of Rock'n'Roll past.  As an aging fan of U2 I have listened to this new album many times and concluded that I will not buy it.
B00004W221|5.0|While that remark may be harsh, and to some actually taken in a mean-spirited way, please read it once more, and consider it in love. Because Rudy had to do just that, and while in the film it wasn't said quite in that manner, that was the point. And in the end, the man with the dream, the one who listened to all the taunts, teases, and endured the agony of defeat, came out swinging. All adversaries whether friends or just plain creeps, they all ate crow in the end. The ones who encouraged Rudy shared in the joy of his victory!<br /><br />Hey, you watch this and you just think to yourself about how easy it is to throw in the towel. To get so disgusted with everything life throws at you, and just quit. I've done it, even seen some people do it with life. Life was just too tough, therefore suicide was the easiest way out. But it seemed to me that sometimes Rudy had that tough love when he wanted to give up. When he tried to say that a whole year at Holy Cross was a waste, his boss, the maintenance man told him this, \\"You got your head so far up your ass about that damn football team, you missed the fact. You just got a year of top quality education. Waste? Don't be wastin' my time!\\" If that doesn't wake you up, then keep dreaming! Listen to the ones who mentor you. You might not always like what they say, but they're usually always right!<br /><br />If you get just 1 thing out of this film, just remember to get up when you get knocked down. Don't let jerks get the best of you. John Hagee said, \\"When God sends you out in the ocean to catch Moby Dick, TAKE THE TARTER SAUCE WITH YOU!!!\\" The final lesson in this is simple. Don't apologize for your efforts. You will always have the kind of people who tell you, \\"Look at who you might be hurting, you only think of yourself.\\" I've had to learn that sometimes, a simple SCREW YOU works just fine with that crowd, and I just kept my eyes open. Is this a tough lesson to learn? Oh yes is is! Is it worth it? Even more so. This movie is awesome for old and young alike, because it touches the soul, and ultimately builds a warrior. Kudos!ovie is awesome for old and young alike, because it touches the soul, and ultimately builds a warrior. Kudos!
B0006VIE4C|5.0|I found that a new hope was the best star wars film ever made. I would give it 10/10.
B0001LJC2K|5.0|I love Radiohead. They're one of my favorite bands and now that I heard Muse, they are too. A lot of people are saying that they sound like Radiohead. In my opinion, the only similarities between the two is that the singers sound the same at times, and both bands make incredible music. That's where the similarity ends. I don't think I've ever heard Radiohead make a song that sounds like \\"Apocalypse Please\\" or \\"Hysteria\\". If so please tell me.  <br /> <br />Muse blend together the eclectic sounds that Radiohead innovated and the rock-opera sounds of Queen to make something totally original. This was overlooked by the critics but this definitely was the best album of the year, hands down.
B00003CWN3|4.0|I am giving Kimberly Peirce's BOYS DON'T CRY four stars because, simply looking at it as a piece of filmmaking, it is startlingly effective. But I must also admit that, after seeing this movie, I was a little uneasy about the filmmakers' approach to this based-on-real-life story, one that I think to some extent simplifies and conventionalizes what could have been truly disturbing material.    There is no doubt that BOYS DON'T CRY is acted and directed with great sensitivity and realism. This one of the most vivid depictions of humdrum small-town life I have seen; you really feel as if you are in Falls City, Nebraska, among its wide open spaces and bored citizens. And the performances are excellent. Hilary Swank, of course, won an Oscar for her depiction of Teena Brandon/Brandon Teena, and it is a sympathetic, totally involving performance, one that beautifully conveys the joy she takes in being a male, and her desperation as her ruse threatens to fall apart. The other performances are no less worthy, though, particularly Chloe Sevigny's as small-town dreamer Lana Tisdel, and Peter Sarsgaard's as John Lotter, who will eventually turn on Brandon. And, as a whole, it must be said that BOYS DON'T CRY is effectively tragic and haunting, without ever lapsing into heavy-handed sentimentality.     And yet, there is something about the movie that strikes me as false. I think that, to some degree, Peirce has simplified this fascinating, unsettling story, and turned it into a modern day operatic tragedy (in its own down-to-earth way). She has turned the real-life story into a rather more conventional tale about intolerance---Teena Brandon is tortured and then murdered for daring to be something she is not---and thereby spurned any serious attempts at genuine insight into why Teena Brandon did what she did. What made her feel more comfortable acting like a man, for instance? We never really know; the movie never truly bothers to explain, except by dropping vague hints about a \\"sexual identity crisis.\\" Instead, Peirce is simply content to tell a story that, at heart, is about how a Love That Never Dies---the relationship between Brandon and Lana (whose loyalty to Brandon I personally found slightly unconvincing, as true as it may be)---can triumph over the rage of a bunch of small-town bigots. What the film lacks, I think, is the willingness to go deeper into its material. On its own terms, the movie is effectively tragic and haunting; but, if Peirce was more willing to dig deeper into its characters, and not settle for simplification and conventionality, BOYS DON'T CRY could have been truly disturbing and thought-provoking rather than merely sad.    Still, I don't want to sell this movie too short. This is basically a good movie, one that is realistic, well-made, and superbly acted. For real insight into Teena Brandon, you will have to look elsewhere; but what BOYS DON'T CRY lacks in nuance, it makes up for in heartbreaking big gestures. Recommended, with reservations.
B000062YAZ|5.0|No doubt every single metal fan on the face of the Earth has heard of Slayer. No doubt most of them have this CD already. If in case you haven't, you should. It truly is a classic.  <br /> <br />Reign in Blood only goes for about half an hour, but it's a brutal half an hour to say the least. Thrash Metal at it's greatest. Kerry King, Jeff Hanneman, Dave Lombardo and Tom Araya are at their very best here. It truly shocks me how they could come up with a masterpiece such as this. <br /> <br />Angel of Death is a very well known song with THAT riff in the middle of it. It's the first song on here, and just kicks straight into it. Straight forward and to the point. Another well-known song is obviously Raining Blood, with the awesome intro. I love this song for the intro alone. It reminds me of Black Sabbath's song \\"Black Sabbath\\", how it starts with a 'spooky' intro to the song with rain, and thunder. <br /> <br />Slayer fans should DEFINITELY already have this. People new to Slayer should absolutely get this, and see how Slayer set a new standard for all metal bands after the release of this album. I also can't believe that Slayer haven't really 'slowed down' in a sense. They still continue to make top-quality records, like Diabolus in Musica and their latest release God Hates us All. Every metal fan should get a taste of this. 5/5
B00004RFCM|4.0|I've never watched this show before buying this DVD back 2000, I had heard about it, but never actually watch it, and let me tell you the minute a saw the first one I could not stopped until going thru the whole 12 episode that contains this DVD.    It is obvious that the first episode was shooted way early than the rest since is very different, in looks and style from the other 11, but let me tell you that all the difference were to improve the show, I did not the look Sarah Jessica Parker has om that first episode, she looks kinda cheap, but begging the 2nd episode she stared to look way better and the rest of the girls too.    In this first season they were using the trick to talked directly to the camare when they staring analysis the topics' of each week show. This were dropped later and also for good use.    I gave this season 4 stars, because in this season they starting to correct errors and make it more of a continue story, if you waych the first and the twelth episodes you see a very different look and way to narrate the story.    This was one of the first sitcoms (if not the first) that has no male leads and let the girls talked in whatever way thet wanted to, using terms that being in HBO let them use, it seems there were no limits or bounduries to them, that was part of the appealing that they show has with the audience.    Hihglights of this season:  Carrie.- Meets Mr Big... is Mr Big girlfriend... Brokes up with Mr. Big.  Samantha.- The wild one, goes throu a lot of guys and ends the season with a guy with a tiny.. deffect.  Charlotte.- Starts with the worries about if she evr gonna get married or not.  Miranda.- The more cynical one, has a romance with a guy named Skipper.
B00006JJ51|4.0|I'm not the greatest fan of Rap, the music i mostly listen to is Metal..But i have a few Rap CD's, mostly Public Enemy, Cypress Hill, and N.W.A. N.W.A are pretty famous, consisting of extremely good rappers, such as Ice Cube, Dr. Dre, and Eazy E. Eazy E has since passed away, but Ice Cube and Dr. Dre are still doing well in the world of Rap.  <br /> <br />On this CD, \\"Straight Outta Compton\\", the most notable songs to me would be F*ck The Police, Straight Outta Compton, Gangsta Gangsta, Express Yourself, If It Ain't Ruff and Something Like That. (On the Extra Tracks of this, i'd add \\"A B*tch iz a B*tch\\") But these are only the most famous songs on this mainly. Every song is enjoyable. The beats are awesome, and the rapping is perfect. <br /> <br />I think anyone who says they're into Rap should own this. Rap nowadays is really poor, in my opinion, when you look at the \\"Usher's\\" and \\"Chingy's\\". It's really pathetic. Check this out if you want real top-quality Rap, done properly. Also check out Niggaz4Life, and even their Greatest Hits CD, which has pretty much every famous song they've done on it.  <br /> <br />Straight Outta Compton is a true Classic.
B0000669JL|1.0|First off, I'm not a reggae guy. I think the music is really phony and it doesn't say anything. Supposedly it's angry music but to me it is a really superficial sound. Second, I think the music is about the most unnerving and grating music ever performed by human musicians. Also, I don't get the 'We Be Jamming' thing. I know it's only a 5 minute song but to me it feels like it just goes on and on. I'd say if you're a conformist, and person that doesn't enjoy standing out of the crowd then buy this album. However, if you cherish individuality and evolution in art then you won't need any of this crap.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I barely knew this show existed, and I was already a Joss Whedon fan!  I'm on my second viewing of the DVD's, and I am completely blown away.  I am waiting breathlessly for the feature film release.  For those of you out there who don't know, it's September 30, 2005. <br />

B000002B30|5.0|Why are you reading this review instead of ordering the CD?  This is a \\"Must Have\\" a collection of some of the definitive folk -- \\"white soul\\"? albums of the 70s and 80s.  If I could only have one album I would have a hard time parting with this.  An excellent intro into the music of The Boss.

B0002KVUKM|2.0|Films like this really should not have millions wasted on their being made, and the box office returns really did not much make up for it. Overall this movie is crap-tacular (though not as crap-tacular as if the events of this film were to occur in real life.)
B00005JN2Z|3.0|I recently played the game Hitman 2: Silent Assassin on my Gamecube. The title really says it all: SILENT Assassin. Yes? However I didn't particularly find it much fun with all that stealth and creeping around. I just went in guns blazing. I was crap. But I wasn't as bad as Vincent in this movie.<br /><br />Tom Cruise plays Vincent (ooh ahh, Tom is playing a bad guy, hype, hype, hype) a thoroughly conspicuous looking character who is in LA for a spot of contract killing. He hires unhappy cabbie Max (Jamie Foxx) for the whole night. Five stops, five kills, yadda yadda yadda...you've seen the trailer.<br /><br />This arrangement might have worked if Vincent were competent in the least. But he's just terrible. He leaves evidence everywhere, makes moronic mistakes, walks in front of every CCTV camera in LA and blabs far too much to Max, who any half-competent assassin would off at the end of the night anyway. Whatever the bad guys are paying him, the paycheck far exceeds the skill.<br /><br />Michael Mann directs the film with amazing skill, brilliantly capturing the multiple looks and feelings of night-time LA. There are many scenes of tangible atmosphere in Collateral, so much so that the film is eerily calming. A very slickly crafted film, but not as memorable as previous films in Mann's career.<br /><br />Cruise and Foxx have great chemistry together though it must be said that Foxx comes off as the better performer/character. Neither of them overact and keep their cool but there's a true realistic edge to his lonely cabbie than Cruise's idiot assassin who leaves incriminating exhibits A-Z all over LA.<br /><br />The DVD is in gorgeous looking 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen with colors so vivid and lifelike you'll forget your watching a movie and not real life. The Dolby 5.1 soundtrack is also stunning, fully complimenting the movie's dynamic sound design. Gunshots are very loud and pack a heavy punch, if you have a home theatre you'll love it. James Newton Howard's atmospheric score is also seamlessly woven into the film's sound design and it's surely Howard at the top of his game, miraculously blending his own score with non-original tracks.

B0002X314C|5.0|John Legend is definitely the best R&B singer to come around since Alicia Keys. And that's how it happens, every so many years you get someone that captivates the mind and imagination. This year, that person is John Legend. And those complaining that this album is lyrically weak must be listening to a different album because that's not the impression that I got. John accomplishes much more with his simplicity and straightforward approach than some others do with their profound essays. For example on the song \\"Stay With You,\\" he actually reminds me more of Norah Jones. They both have a similar attractive quality to their voice. Sometimes less can be more, but it just depends on the artist. John's CD operates on more of a human level than most do. It's more personal and inviting. People keep mentioning those classic R&B artist because John is really on that level and has that potential. He can really push further and go beyond what his other male R&B counterparts are doing. Marvin Gaye had the ability to stimulate the mind, body, and soul. And that's what John attempts to do with his debut CD \\"Get Lifted.\\" But it's a different time, a different era. You can't duplicate everything entirely. John has a more contemporary producer and collaborator, but a very good one. That being Kanye West. A perfect match in my opinion. Although, it is hard to pinpoint John and say he's this or that. You'll probably have to wait for his sophomore album to get a more complete picture. Like \\"The Diary of Alicia Keys\\" was a more definitive set for Alicia, I'm sure whatever shortcomings \\"Get Lifted\\" may or may not have will be addressed on his next album. So I would encourage you to enjoy this CD and prepare yourself for the next one. Because if it gets any better, John Legend's career will surely match that of his last name. <br /> <br />NOTE: Be sure to check out the Graffiti Wall at JohnLegend.com to see more great reviews.
0780622553|5.0|I must admit, the first time I saw Dark City, I had to make an effort to like it. I appreciated its wonderful visuals and its oppresive atmosphere, but I came away feeling vaguely dissatisfied for some reason. However, after a little while I found myself wanting to watch it again and again, and every time there was something more to discover about Dark City. It's common to compare this movie to the Matrix, and while I would agree that I liked the Matrix better the first time around, after that first viewing I had very little desire to watch it again. Not so with Dark City; I've seen it 4 or 5 times by now and I still feel like there's more to see. Alex Proyas has created what seems to be a fiction universe with no boundaries; the city of the night seems to go on forever and is constrained only by your imagination. <br /> <br />I must admit, though, that the climax does not really fit the rest of the film. I wish Proyas had found a way to settle things psychologically rather than physically, but that is a small quibble, and the conclusion of the film still takes my breath away. <br /> <br />WARNING!!! Please, for your own sake, fast forward through the voiceover at the beginning of the movie. You can go back and watch it later if you want, but if it's your first time watching it will ruin it for you. Fast forward until you get to the \\"Dark City\\" title screen, and watch from there.
B000024JEX|5.0|If you have never heard of ECM records , then the first thing to mention would be that all the releases have wonderful engineering . I'm not a recording engineer , but if I hear an instrument recorded and I feel that what I'm hearing is a realistic approximation of that sound , then I'm very happy .    This aspect helps you to enjoy the music and all its dynamics .    This set has no fake 'echo' on it - it's a faithful recording .    This trio , like all great groups , have been working together for a long time - about 20 years .  At that stage , the connection goes beyond personal and takes on a whole deeper significance.      Keith is an inspiration to piano players .    Gary is a bassist who is always ready to react , yet you can tell he is always feeling the music .    I'm a drummer and if you enjoy the sound of one of the best and most creative people alive today playing a drumkit , then this is the set to buy , as the drummer Jack is the sort of player that makes me smile .    The music will jump out at you - in a good way .    The trio is wonderful - it's a shame to think that some people think of jazz as a background for their dinner parties .    This is not that sort of record .     May I suggest you make the single CD with selections from this box your first purchase , then progress to this if you like the single CD . I took a chance on the whole thing and am very happy I did . Keith does make noises while he plays - I'm not that keen on it myself , but if I could play the piano like him , then it wouldn't really matter .     No wonder it won jazz magazine Down Beat's Album of the Year in 1996 . Listen and enjoy .
B0002XVQNU|5.0|Here it is! The Darker, grittier, edgirer, but better version of Mark Steven Johnson's adaption of Stan Lee's comic book character Daredevil. Having being  30 minutes longer than its crappier theatrical release, This 133-minute Director's Cut of Daredevil offers more story, better preformances by actors and actresses (especially by Joe Pantoliano [Ben Urich], and Jon Favreau [Franklin \\"Foggy\\" Nelson]), and a whole subplot that was cut out by the executives at 20th Century Fox (wanted to keep a PG-13 rating and wanted it under 100 minutes). <br /> <br />Personally, I thought Fox was being stupid by cutting out the subplot in which Matt Murdock (Daredevil) agrees to defend a man (Coolio) framed for murder. Here in this cut of the film, it shows you how Mr. Murdock deals in the court of law more efficently.  <br /> <br />I can see how parts like the confessionals and the love scene were not included in the Director's Cut. They were needed to make a crappier theatrical release of this movie, which could have been bigger and better. Althought it's rated 14A in Canada, an MPAA rating of \\"R\\" dosen't really go with me. I mean it's not a graphic cut, but it is a darker cut. And there is really only two or three parts of language (especially the part of Bullseye saying \\"I want a f***ing costume\\" rather than \\"I want a bloody costume\\"). <br /> <br />Despite the negative remarks about the rating, and the lack of special features (which only has a commentary and a 15-minute featurette), I still give it a 5-star rating. It's a much better film adaption of the comic book. At least Fox was smart by releasing this Director's Cut (or better version of this film) of Daredevil.
B0000TB03W|5.0|Shania Twain  after 3.5 yrs of not being on stage is still the best her music rocks I recommend this DVD for your collection. Her interaction with her fans is great. She shows that in the tune She Not Just A Pretty Face when she goes down to one of her fans..
B00005JNBQ|4.0|This Mormon comedy, (yes, you heard me right, it's Mormon), is as deadpan as anything you have seen. That includes all of Wes Anderson's movies. Except Anderson's comedies are goofy. This movie is really polarizing in nature. You either love it or hate it. <br /> <br />Ebert hated it. He claims it to be depressing. In a way, he's right. If one were to view this movie as a drama of a urban small town still stuck in '82, well, we got one of those Sundance indie flick right now.  <br /> <br />This movie transcends beyond the conventions of any cliches you find in modern cinema. The characters, close ups or medium, are simply placed right smack in the middle. There is a sense of symmetry going on here. Relationships between characters are kept within a minimal physical contact. The dialouge is absolutely inane, insipid and mundane. But let's face it, in a sleepy town like this, what sort of small talk would you expect? <br /> <br />Napoleon Dynamite represents the epitome of an ultimate high school geek still stuck in fourth grade. Still obsessed with doodling pictures of mythical beasts (not very well drawn IMHO), feeling all icky about going out with girls, standing by like minded friends through thick and thin.  <br /> <br />Eventually, what won me over and had me re-evaluating this movie again was this single line near the end of the movie, before the \\"grandslam finale\\" on stage, whereby Pedro was about to lose all hope of winning the School President election. Napoleon asked him to go for it, \\"Just follow your heart, that's what I do.\\" Such simple lines, but yet it validates all of Napoleon's actions throughout the movie. He has been telling everyone that he has been doing things he feels like doing but like the rest of the world, they \\"hear\\" you but no one's \\"listening\\".
0763624292|5.0|I work with different age groups from 0-5years old.  Kids as young as 1 year old enjoy the story telling portion of this cd. I do alot of handplays/body movements which the kids mimic as the story is playing. I use the cd alone and in conjunction with the book.  Kids love it either way!<br /><br />The first track is the lively descriptive tale and subsequent tracks are different \\"lessons\\" you can do with your kids/students if you like. I would recommend that the adult listen to those parts and introduce the lessons over time, don't overload a younger child's imagination with it.  It's a great cd with charismatic voices and appropriate music that really brings to life a terrific children's book.
0440238609|5.0|These books are intense.  As parent to an eight year old who has read the Harry Potter series, I would not give these to her just yet.  Phillip Pullman is a storyteller, first and foremost, and the story he weaves is compelling.  I review this as a whole - not three separate books.  Personally, one cannot exist without the others. <br /> <br />Mr. Pullman's characters are memorable (Mrs. Coulter continues to show up in my nightmares), and very, very human.  Yes, he takes quite a swipe at organized religion, and yes, I agree with his assesment that the Narnia series is both bigoted and sexist,  (although, a product of its time) making His Dark Materials more enjoyable to me.   <br /> <br />Phillip Pullman is referred to by the media as an aethist, but I see his books as carrying quite a Buddhist message, also.  (a very similar view of death - as well as his approach to living life here and now.) <br /> <br />I thoroughly enjoyed the books, although I did space out reading them over a few months.  As a bereaved parent, I found the parts written about the land of the dead extremely difficult to read - it hurt, but I read them through.   <br /> <br />I've read many comments about the unsatisfying ending -- there aren't always happy endings.  Personally, I found the ending very right for the books, very fitting. <br /> <br />I plan to give these books to my daughter in two years or so - not for just their tremendous story, but for their world view of religion.  What I don't understand, is why the conservative churches in my area continue to burn Harry Potter and pass completely over these books, lol... <br /> <br />Thank you, Mr. Pullman, for sharing Lyra's world with us.  Your books have affected me... <br />
B00008OWZC|5.0|I DON'T KNOW WHY I WAITED SO LONG TO GET THIS.  It is essentially the DVDs on CD but hey you can't beat listening to this in your car.  Hey folks you can't do that with your DVDs.  I know they have waited a very long time to release this but have you EVER heard 70's live music sound so good through 21st century stereos!!!???  This is the best it gets, besides having seen them live at the concerts.  The CDs constitute an era that would otherwise have died out with our parents but now I being 20, can show my friends what real music sounds like.  If you like rock I don't care what kind, you will love at least 88% of this set.  Just because some songs do play long but you have to sit in a wild wonder at the bow jimmy uses on the guitar in dazed and confused and Jons MOBY DICK!! it's absolutley incredible just get this CD if you're still reading this review.
0790732254|4.0|The movie \\"Who's afraid of Virginia Woolf?\\" is about two couples, George & Martha and Honey & Nick, who meet at the house of George & Martha after a party, drink alcohol and talk about their lives. They have quarrels about nearly every theme which is mentioned. <br />  <br />After I read the book \\"Who's afraid of Virginia Woolf?\\" by Edward Albee i was very anxious for seeing the adaption. <br /> <br />When i saw that Elizabeth Taylor an Richard Burton play the parts of the protagonists Martha and George i expected a great movie and i havn't been disappointed. <br /> <br />The dialogues, music and facial expressions make the film a special one, which i can recommend to everyone!
B00005JN2Z|4.0|There are no great actions or special effects. This might be one of the budget movies. Despite of it, the movie is not boring but actually enjoyable and fun to watch. I would say this film has a strange magic. I don't think it's only because of Tom Cruise, who looks great with gray hair and acts precisely. This film is different. One thing I really liked about this film was the way of look. I mean, the images of the whole movie are very natural and vivid as I watch a \\"live\\" TV show. It is something I've never seen before. This feature makes the film very unique and worth watching.
B00062ZE3U|5.0|This is my favorite cd out of all the ones I own. Words cannot even express how much I adore this album. I never heard about Within Temptation until this album came out. The Silent Force definitely made me love WT because they are simply amazing. All the songs on this cd are perfect, I love all of them. Sharon has such a beautiful and pure voice. The music is great and so is the choir. I suggest this cd to anyone who loves great singing and music! You won't be disappointed because it's worth every penny. 5/5 for sure!
B00005KBM7|5.0|While British rock band Muse are big in the UK, the US is only just starting to get acquainted with these original, entrancing musicians. And their second album, \\"Origin of Symmetry,\\" they accomplish the almost impossible -- every song is epic and thrilling.<br /><br />The first two songs open with delicate rippling piano intros that suddenly blossom into rock riffs. Feedback kicks off into sizzling basslines and riffs in \\"Plug In Baby\\" and \\"Citizen Erased,\\" while wind chimes and an acoustic melody are at the heart of \\"Screenager.\\" \\"Hyper Music\\" is the only dud. It's a discordant clatter that becomes a discordant rock song -- nuff zed.<br /><br />But as good as most of the album is, Muse save the best for absolute last. The penultimate song \\"Feeling Good\\" is perhaps the best -- fuzzy chopsticks start the song, followed by a stretch of epic rock and soaring vocals. The finale is no less entrancing, a slowly stately wave of sound that slowly transitions into an equally rich rock song.<br /><br />Americans really got to know Muse through their latest album, \\"Absolution.\\" But it's not the only album they have done, nor is it the best. \\"Origin of Symmetry\\" may well take that honor, or at least tie with their debut \\"Showbiz.\\" Relatively few people know about these earlier albums, or about the rich apocalyptic quality of Muse at their best.<br /><br />Muse is definitely a band for Radiohead fans -- it has the same rich spaciness and art-rock quality, but it's more grounded and gritty. The most entrancing instrumentation is done on piano -- it can be delicate, dark, fuzzy, or outright epic. The piano is accompanied by smashing percussion, sinuous riffs and basslines, and sweeps of spellbinding electronics.<br /><br />Matt Bellamy puts his good vocals to use in every song, and he's as versatile as his piano. Much of the time he opts for the smooth, low sound. But he also gets to howl, and occasionally sounds like he's been huffing helium. And the songwriting is also pretty solid, often focusing on betrayal and a lover who \\"was so beautiful.\\"<br /><br />Muse deftly dodged the sophomore slump in \\"Origin of Symmetry,\\" a soaring rock epic that won't be fast forgotten. An outstanding piece of work.ing is also pretty solid, often focusing on betrayal and a lover who \\"was so beautiful.\\"  <br />  <br />Muse deftly dodged the sophomore slump in \\"Origin of Symmetry,\\" a soaring rock epic that won't be fast forgotten.

B0002SROT0|5.0|Noone can dispute that Smith did not get to finish the mixes or pick the track selection, after all  he died, with the album uncompleted , but that's the nature of all posthumous recordings: they're never quite what the artist intended. Critics, fans, can argue endlessy about  the songs on From a Basement on the Hill .and how it would have sounded if Smith had finished the record, but that doesn't take away from the simple fact that the music here is strong enough to warrant the release, and that gives us a sense of closeur to his discography.  <br /> <br />While it's likely that From a Basement is cleaner than what Smith would have liked, it is much sparer than Figure 8, and it feels at once more adventurous, confident, and warmer than its predecessor. And its definitely  not \\"the next White Album,\\" which is what Smith was always striving for, but it has a similarly freewheeling spirit. It's not far removed from any of Smith's previous works, but it feels like a step away from the careful Figure 8 and more personal than XO. The most surprising thing is that despite the  lyrics that seem to foretell  his suicide ,it's not a dark heavy album. Like the best of his music, From a Basement on the Hill is warm in its sadness. Given Smith's tragic fate, it also sadly seems like a summation of his work. All of his trademarks are here  his soft, sad voice, his addiction to '60s pop, what Elliot left us  are a strong set of songs that stands among his best. It may or may not be the album that he intended , but as it stands, From a Basement on the Hill is a fond farewell to a singer/songwriter who many considered a friend.  <br />
0784011206|4.0|First Blood is a straight-forward, well-written action flick that keeps the audiences attention and ends on an emotional note that serves to expose the plight of our veterans of vietnam.  John Rambo's treatment by the local sheriff is not unlike that which some of our less fortunate citizens experience when law enforcement gets carried away.  For an action film, First Blood didn't stray too far away from reality like many of today's hyper-violent films do.  For that reason, the film succeeded and has a loyal fanclub.  If there's anyone left who hasn't seen First Blood, I think you'll be glad you did. <br /> <br />A spotlight reviewer stated she didn't like Stallone's acting because his voice is annoying and his mouth is squinted to one side, like a stroke victim.  Well, you nearly guessed it.  For the record, Stallone had a complicated birth that left one side of his face paralyzed, hence his speech impediment and asymetrical facial features.  The guy is a lot smarter than he sounds.  I applaud him for overcoming what in today's acting world would be a career-limiting featural flaw. <br /> <br />Stallone has had his share of flops (Judge Dread, etc) but he can act with the best of them when the film is well written and directed.  He's also a talented writer, as evidenced by his writing credit for Rocky. <br /> <br />I can't say enough good things about Brian Dennehy as Sheriff Wil Teasle.  He really nailed the part.  I especially liked his squaring off with Colonel Samuel Trautman.  Dennehy brings a wealth of acting ability to any film he's in.  If Stallone is the brick, Dennehy is the mortar in First Blood.  Well done.
B0002OERI0|4.0|It's tempting to pigeon hole Green Day's  ambitious seventh album,  as their version of a Who album, the next logical step after the Kinks-inspired underrated 2000 effort, Warning, but things aren't that easy. American Idiot is 100% a rock opera, a form that Pete Townshend pioneered with Tommy, but Green Day doesn't copy Tommy as much as they borrow from the Who's mini-opera \\"A Quick One, While He's Away,\\" whose succession of 90-second songs isn't only strived to be equal with on two song  here, but gives the band  the template for the larger picture that is American Idiot. But the Who are not the only here.     The story of St. Jimmy has an angle similar to Hsker D'S landmark Zen Arcade, while the music is filled with a pomp straight from the school of Queen and Rocky Horror Picture Show , all tied together with a  political passion that can only be equaled by the Clash, .     Its east to reduce the Cd to its influences but that gives the wrong impression that this is no more than a copy of past and familiar sounds, when it's an distinctive, introspective work in its own . First of all, part of Green Day's appeal is how they have personalized the sounds of the past, making time-honored guitar rock traditions seem fresh, even vital. With their first albums, they styled themselves after first-generation punk they were too young to hear firsthand, and as their career progressed, the group not only synthesized these influences into something distinctive, but Armstrong turned into a muscular, versatile songwriter in his own right.     Warning illustrated their musical growth quite impressively, but on Idiot, the music isn't just tougher,  it fuels the anger, disillusionment, heartbreak, frustration, paranoia and fear living in America in the days following 9/11, but also showcased here are small-scale intimate portraits and individual character sketches. There's a lot to absorb here, and some might dismiss it after just one listen as a bit too much for the likes of Green day,  when in reality it is a  rich, mature work of one great band.      Like all  concept albums, this one works in several different ways. It can be taken as a collection of great songs .songs that are as visceral or as poignant as Green Day at their best, songs that resonate outside of the larger canvas of the story, as the fiery anti-Bush title anthem proves ,but when taken as a whole these songs have a much larger impact.      there really aren't many records like American Idiot  In its musical muscle and sweeping, politically charged narrative, it's something of a masterpiece, and one of the few - if not the only - records of 2004 to convey what it feels like to live in the strange, bewildering America of the early 2000's.
0855328355|5.0|This is a wonderful book if you're looking for a visual guide to help you get started. I had never done silk ribbon embroidery before, but I was easily able to create beautiful roses, leaves and stems.  The many full color photos are taken very close up so you can really see each step clearly. After you've made a few petals and leaves, you'll see how easy it is to create stunningly beautiful embroideries using only a few, simple stitches.  You'll also learn how to paint a background, and how to mount and frame your work.
6305841861|5.0|Up until this past year's hilarious \\"Shaun of the Dead,\\" this film, \\"Evil Dead II,\\" really had no competition whatsoever for the funniest Horror film ever made.  It would be easy to rave about this Cult Classic filled with trick photography, stop-motion animation, over-the-top gore-soaked casualties, Bruce Campbell's charming chin, and one of the most underrated endings in film history, but I will point out why this particular DVD is exceptional instead.  What makes this DVD rock is that the sound has been digitally remastered into THX surround sound.  The sound-effects in this film are essential to magnify the humor and horror to its great heights.  The other reason to get this DVD is the commentary which includes writer-director Sam Raimi, star Bruce Campbell, co-writer Scott Spiegel, and special make-up effects artist Greg Nicotero.  I swear that listening to these guys self-deprecate and otherwise rip on themselves and the movie is as much fun as watching this film for the very first time.  No kidding.  I was rolling with laughter.  For the quintessential backstory on this film may I recommend Bruce Campbell's thoroughly enjoyable book, \\"If Chins Could Kill,\\" which is loaded with reminiscences about his time before, during, and after making this landmark Horror film classic.  \\"Evil Dead II\\" is a necessary purchase for any Horror film afficionado.  Highly recommended.
B00005JNBQ|3.0|Napoleon Dynamite certainly panders the MTV fans, not the music fans, but the those responsible for more than one season of \\"The Real World\\". While the film is slow and boring, and at times painfully so, it does not purport to be anything else. It's not trying to be and American Pie teen-movie: gross-out humor and a high-school-(...)(not that there isn't a place for that in American film). The humor is very sporadic but quick, and most significantly, RANDOM. If you haven't asked yourself \\"What in the hell am I watching?\\" every ten minutes for the first half-hour, then you don't understand the humor in this movie: Stereotyped characters, dead-pan high school comedy, keep your eye on the dweeb and don't expect to be spoiled by luxuries like background music. Most people will either love it or hate it. I, on the other hand, found it \\"OK\\".
0393035158|5.0|Contrary to the Publisher's Weekly review, this book is neither simple nor misguided. In fact, its right on target. As Harris points out, nowhere else in popular culture do the unfounded and antiquated ideas put forth in modern religions go unquestioned. Christians, Muslims, Jews - they're equally guilty at professing ideas that are wholly unsupported by fact. They might as well be worshipping Zeus, or rather Seuss. There's more logic in the children's books than in tomes like the bible. Why is it that these holy rollers require such a user's guide to life, one that is fraught with contradictions and faulty logic? The U.S. tax code makes more sense. Why do they insist  <br />ALL people follow their dogma? The bible, koran, etc. are no more the voice of god than the flatulence emerging from my ass. <br /> <br />Spirituality is freedom and inspiration. Religion is the antihesis of spirituality - its all about control, dogma and hate. Unfortunately, it will be a long time before the masses realize the folly of their religions. In the meantime, we can gather hope for the future from brave authors like Sam Harris. <br />
B0002Z0EYK|3.0|Just another film among the recent glut which tries to capitalize on the success of The Lord of the Rings and its epic battles and sword and arrow warfare. TROY, however, really begs for the \\"LOTR wannabe\\" comparisons by starring two main actors from the epic trilogy: Orlando Bloom and Sean Bean. In fact, one would think TROY was purposefully trying raise an unconscious comparison in our minds by hiring them. To complete the connection, there's an amusing moment at the end when Orlando Bloom finally discovers his \\"inner elf\\" and sends Pitt to pin cushion school.  Unfortunately, though TROY is formed around similar battle scenes with enormous armies, the overall effect is much less awe-inspiring. Sure, you have Wolfgang Petersen using Peter Jackson's patented aerial swoops over the massive armies as they collide head on, but when you get down close the fighting is so overcrowded it is more like pushing and shoving and tripping.  To draw our attention away from this, we are treated mostly to one-on-one fighting scenes which are going on between the main actors.   Being an R-rated movie, I had thought the battles would have had more gore, but I have to confess that the PG-13 LOTR trilogy, though virtually bloodless, was far more violent than this R-rated feature. TROY, with all of its ferocious combat, has no decapitations and no severed limbs, which would have been perfectly acceptable when you consider that the rating gave them more room to work in such realism. Even the nudity was sadly restricted to just butts. Huh?!?! I don't see anything worth an R-rating here.  To its credit, TROY does move along at a rapid pace, gets to the action immediately and rarely lets up for long. It's battle after battle, but nothing nearly as exciting as in LOTR which it clearly draws some ideas from.  Though TROY obviously wants to be called \\"The Lord of the Trojans\\", its grand scale doesn't come off quite as epic. The special effects are very good and the acting is decent, but afterwatching it I wasn't left with any feeling that I had just witnessed something incredible or even memorable. It's not a bad movie and worth a watch, but you may or may not feel the urge to view it more than once.
B0002KVUL6|1.0|Ohmigosh, this movie goes on forever. The writing is so very incredibly bad; one deus ex machina after another--the sort of writing you would hope someone would grow out of once they got out of 4th grade. Lots of noise, lots of really ugly CGI creatures, lots of attempts to sound savvy by referencing classic monster movies--also lots of cliched dialog and situations (and not used in a savvy way). None of it is the least bit interesting or makes the least bit of sense. It's just a total, utter, complete waste of time. Boredom in widescreen.
B00005JNBQ|1.0|This movie lacks any plot, and there was no humor in it. Also, Napolean is to annoying to watch for two hours.
B0002Z0EYK|3.0|\\"Troy\\" is in many ways an infuriating film, because it seemed like a sure thing.  Everyone knew that a major film had to be made about the battle for Troy, arguably the most famous one in the history of western civilization (at least in terms of its fame longevity).  A talented cast and proven director was assembled, it was given a $160,000,000 budget, and the prerelease hype was huge.  Of course, the film was roasted when it was finally released, and its final gross (at least domestically) was very disappointing.  Now that the hype has died down, I can say that \\"Troy\\" is not a bad movie, but just a disappointing one. <br /> <br />The movie is awash in moral ambiguity.  That might work for Vietnam War films, but it is missplaced here.  We desparately want a hero to root for, but Achilles does not fit that mold.  For most of the film, he's cold, unsympathetic, and even borderline cruel.  Brad Pitt's performance does not help- it is adequate at its best moments, and terrible at its worst.  Where's Tyler Durden when you need him? <br /> <br />As it turns out, the best and most sympathetic performances are given from the Trojan side, in the forms of Eric Bana and Peter O'Toole.  Bana's Hector seems to be the hero that the audience can root for, and Bana himself is terrific in the role.  This makes the film a real downer, however.  Hector's inevitable fate makes him disappear three quarters of the way through, and without him the film's ending is weak, as we've run out of people to root for.  O'Toole is also touching as the Trojan king, but he is not given enough screen time. <br /> <br />Ultimately, the audience sympathizes with Troy, which makes its inevitable end that much more disappointing.  The Greeks are led by an arrogant and greedy king, played by Brian Cox with over-the-top menace (I know this guy is good at being a villain, but he should seriously consider being in a romantic comedy or something.  STRETCH a little, man!).  By the end of \\"Troy\\", we are rootingagainst the Greeks, and their inevitable victory renders the ending flat.  Imagine if Sauron had triumphed at the end of \\"Return of the King\\", and you'll have an idea how much of a downer \\"Troy\\" ends up being.  I suppose we're supposed to root for Achilles at the end because he has a sudden change of heart, but it's too little too late, and Pitt does not make the change in Achilles convincing. <br /> <br />If you haven't realized by now, I liked \\"Troy\\" all the way up to its ending (although its running time should have been 20 minutes shorter).  The disappearance of Bana and O'Toole from the movie's final moments render them flat, and the failure of the movie to deliver a rousing climax is ultimately its undoing.  Many of the battle scenes in here are spectacular and some of the performances (at least on the Trojan side) are effective, but in the end I'm afraid that \\"Troy\\" is better for a rental than a purchase.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|Firstly, I must say that I'd have given this utter waste of a perfectly good recordable CD a Zero if only I could have. <br /> <br />I'll not babble on forever here, so I'll use just one example of why to not purchase this album... <br /> <br />\\"Toxic\\" not only is the title of track #6, it represents the aural content of this entire disc... though frankly, I could not even make it through all of track #13, so my review is based on the other 12 \\"songs\\" along with a minute or so of #13. <br />\\"Toxic\\" alone is plenty of reason to avoid this album. Apparently Britney's production/engineer team believe that one disgustingly annoying quasi-violin sound is plenty to act as a song's filler between her bubbly, pop-corny, heavily re-engineereed voice. <br />I make my own music on my laptop at home and I must say, in all honesty, that I could clearly outdo her musical backing with a few programs I've only paid $30 to $40 for at the local Best Buy store. <br />So please, I beg of you dear Amazon Shopper, if you want to hear a beautiful female singing voice, do avoid Britney Spears... Instead, I would strongly recommend Dido. She is all talent all the time.
B00008CLOA|5.0|Let me start by saying this is an album that I have grown up with. I had a hippy cousin who bought it for me when I was 5 years old. Since then I have owned at least 7 or 8 different formats of it. I don't care about the whole Wizard of Oz thing all that matters to me is the sound. This album is best listened to with your eyes closed in a quiet room. There is not a bad song on it. There is an underlying story that invloves time, money and brain damage and the lack of time, love of money, leads to brain damage. Just like any Pink Floyd album it is meant to be listened to front to end and sideways. David Gilmour shows that he is the greatest guitarist, most innovative if nothing else on this album. Us and Them will stop most people in their tracks just from the jazzy intro alone. Time is one of the better known songs on here and everything you hear about it is true. Money is a somewhat sarcastic look at greed. Eclipse is the perfect ending. It's just hard to describe how great this album is but it is also hard to shut-up about it. You get a couple of instrumentals on here as well that are so good that you will swear there was lyrics in them. To me this is the greatest album ever made. The White Album by the Beatles is a great album as well but it doesn't have the flow this one does from song to song. I just wish someone could capture the magic these guys had when they made this but until then I will just hit repeat when this cd ends. As for the SACD, I was lucky and got a SACD on sale and you will hear some slight differences but nothing major but if you have a SACD player then get this version. It's the best money you will ever spend.
B00000099Y|1.0|James Manyard Keenan? Whatever. I know people who gave this five stars are just expresing their opinion. They like this CD and there's nothing wrong with that. Remeber I'm expressing mine.  <br /> <br />However, I first heard Tool on the radio. Stinkfist. I must say I still do like that song very much, in fact best Tool song Period, hilarious lyrics! and great tempo. But the rest of the CD is just awful. Eulogy is the most disgusting song I've ever heard. I used to listen to hardcore rap such as Brotha Lynch Hung and nothing ever made me cringe like this song. If you have Christian beliefs stay far far far away, it really is disgusting and ruined the whole Tool experience for me. I'm all the better for it and it's the 1st reason i hate this CD.  <br /> <br />Keenans lyrics, while cleverly written and pieced together, are loads of his personal bullshi#t forced down the throat and on some tracks he just whines and whines. No one really cares how you feel or what you think, that's the 2nd reason I hate this album. <br /> <br />3rd is the lack of direction and the mishmosh thrown in the CD (wtf a cooking recipe refering to satan???? oh that's so hardcore XD) more like totally ridiculous. <br />
B000002UA0|5.0|While this is the first album by Pink Floyd it also may be the strangest. If you are used to DSOTM, WYWH and The Wall then you probably will not like this album. If you are open-minded and like experimental music then you will love this. Syd Barrett was indeed an insane genius. I don't think Floyd would have been better if he would have stayed on though. This album does what The Beatles tried to do, Rolling Stones even took a shot at it and that is making an album that when listened to carefully gives you a feeling of a good trip. The only band that could do that near as good as Floyd was The Doors. Syd's voice on this has an almost evil troll sound to it. The lyrics are sometimes laughable but they do tell a story. I'm a die-hard Floyd fan but David Gilmour is my favorite of the band so I don't think the guitar is as good on this as later albums. This is one of those albums that depending on your mood will have different effects on you. I'm guessing paranoia is one that Syd was going for. Something about a song about a gnome that makes me paranoid anyway. Bike is a catchy little song that you will go around singing for a few days about your bike that you would let someone have but you can't because you borrowed it. My favorite song on this is Flaming. Hearing Syd say, \\"Yipeee you can't see me, but I can you\\" is paranoia at it's best. Like most Floyd albums this flows from song to song. It's a great album. I would recommend it over The Beatles Magical Mystery Tour and Rolling Stones At Their Satanic Majesties Request. It's a really good listen.
B0002ZDVEU|4.0|The Bourne Supremacy, the sequel to \\"The Bourne Identity,\\" is a tightly wound thriller about a CIA operative with partial amnesia - he doesn't remember who he is, but he knows how to outsmart even the most savvy enemy.  Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) lives in Goa with his girlfriend (Franka Potente), trying to piece his past together with snippets of dreams and memories that he writes in a scrapbook.  When their quiet life is shattered by the appearance of an assassin, Bourne is thrust back into his old life of intrigue and danger.<br /><br />The intelligence behind the script keeps this film moving forward at a rapid, engaging clip, but the cinematography can be downright confusing.  One massive car chase is so dizzying that it is impossible to tell what is going on:  it's like watching three card Monty with a hundred cards, and you lose track of where people are.  Despite this, car chase fans will love the exhilarating screech of metal against metal, with cars flying everywhere.  The many plot levels that the film explores - the CIA's pursuit, Bourne's struggle to remember who he was, the assassins operating on their own agenda - keeps the viewer's interest from start to finish.  Damon does a good job of imbuing Bourne with a small amount of humanity struggling to assert itself.<br /><br />This film belongs to Matt Damon, and Damon fans won't be disappointed.  Fans of thrillers and action movies will love the taut suspense.
B000002ILG|3.0|This is another reminiscent of the hair metal plague, but at least is a good album: it has Michael Wagener as producer and a very good guitar player called Vito Bratta. <br /> <br />The songs are boring and outrageous or pedestrian like most of the hair metal bands of that time, and this is this band's best album.
B00005JMYI|3.0|Ron Burgundy would have made an interesting character on Saturday Night Live.  Will Ferrell's skills of observation and exaggeration create a familiar, self-absorbed anchorman ripe for satire.  In five minute sketches, Burgundy would have been yet another hilarious contribution to SNL from Ferrell.  But an entire movie?   <br /> <br />Unlike Buddy from \\"Elf\\" or other creations from SNL alums like Austin Powers, Ron Burgundy simply lacks the substance to carry a film.  After the first few scenes, he is just not funny anymore.  Without juvenile bathroom humor, crude sex jokes and a supporting cast filled with exaggerated, freakishly cliched sidekicks, not many laughs would be found in this movie.   <br /> <br />With that said, Ferrell should be commended for once again tackling a role that requires him to look foolish and unattractive, while asking the audience to laugh AT him (not WITH him).  After equally brave choices in \\"Elf\\" and \\"Old School\\", Ferrell really seems to be an actor who doesn't take himself too seriously and is without any fear of becoming labeled a \\"clown\\".   <br />
B00005JMX6|2.0|I'm sorry but I didn't like it.  I hated this film not because it includes a story about a teenage boy and 'the girl next door.'  That could be interesting as we have seen in 'Risky Business.'  No, this film actually is NOT about the relations between them; it soon tries to find 'funny' gags in such often recycled materials as 'rescue operations' or 'cute, nice speech', which we have already seen in the films like 'Agent Cody Banks' or 'American Pie.' <br /> <br />The actors are charming.  Emile Hirsch plays Matthew Kidman, whose next-door neighbor turns out a new 'house-sitter' Danielle.  When Danielle is Elisha Cuthbert, or Kim of '24', what could he wish for more?  And Danielle later again turns out a porn star.   <br /> <br />But the film, during its lengthy 110 minute course, tries to swallow too much.  Danielle's former love pops up, at the exact moment when we expect.  When you hear Matthew has to make a speech in front of the posh audience, and he realizes that he is on some substance, we know exactly what is going to happen.  And knowing that, the film extends itself by including so many unnecessary things (like some 'wracky' scenes in Vegas!) as if trying to outwit us. <br /> <br />No, the filmmakers should be ashamed of themselves.  Because by extending the story, they wasted these good actors, including likable Hirsch, sexy and charming Cuthbert, and Timothy Olyphant (who appears as unpredictable 'Kelly').  In fact, Olyphant is really a talented one, who should be given better materials than this one. <br /> <br />Occasionally funny, but 'The Girl Next Door' shows one undeniable fact that Hollywood needs able screenwriters more than ever, who can describe the convincing relations between a girl and a boy.  (Consider Ms. Cuthbert was seen in Richard Curtis's 'Love Actually' which could have given a chance for her to shine with more screentime.)  If you find this film amusing (and I don't deny that I was sometimes amused too), that's because of these actors.
B000002HNR|5.0|I'm sorry, but \\"Alive She Cried\\" is marred by Morrison's escalating problem of being wasted, sometimes not even appearing onstage. At one such show in France, the band played as a trio and keyboardist Ray Manzarek took over lead vocals and displayed a Morrison imitation I hadn't known he could do. And the later \\"Live At Hollywood Bowl\\" is only an EP with less than 20 minutes on it and only two real songs: \\"Light My Fire\\" and \\"Unknown Soldier\\", the rest of the tracks being loose segments from \\"Celebration Of the Lizard\\", which you get on this release in its entirety. But on this album, Morrison is in fairly good voice, only marred by having to transpose the refrain of \\"Break On Through\\" because he did that one too late in the show to be able to make the high notes. He does start that one off with the spoken intro to \\"Soft Parade\\", an album that wasn't out yet. We also get the blues oldie \\"Close To You\\" lead sung by Manzarek, who we only hear on lead elsewhere on the b-side of the single \\"Wishful Sinful\\", a track that hasn't reappeared on any rarities sets. This is a bit prophetic, because after Morrison's death the band did two more albums as a blues trio, with Manzarek and guitarist Krieger swapping off lead vocal duties. Those albums are \\"Other Voices\\" and \\"Full Circle\\" and neither are in print anymore. It figures--after all, you have no Morrison, you have no Doors in many fans' eyes. But the centerpiece of the album is the epic \\"Celebration Of the Lizard\\", a work hinted at on the cover of the album \\"Waiting For the Sun\\", lyrics printed in full, but the only part of it that actually appeared on that album was \\"Not To Touch the Earth\\". They never did get around to doing \\"Celebration\\" in the studio.
B00004UEFJ|5.0|Still impressive in its diversity, this influential album appeared like a supernova and endures as a classic because of the quality of the songs. With the exception of the discordant Black Angel's Death Song and to a lesser extent European Son, a lovely melody line underpins every song.<br /><br />This is especially evident on the melancholic Sunday Morning, the resigned Femme Fatale and the wistful All Tomorrow's Parties, but by no means lacking on more confrontational tracks like Venus In Furs or Heroin. I'll Be Your Mirror has the same folkie feel as Sunday Morning, while the roughness of Black Angel and European Son (the latter dedicated to poet Delmore Schwarts, one of Reed's heroes) has become more digestible as the mainstream has caught up with this pioneering work.<br /><br />The voice of Nico, the archetypical Teutonic Blonde, adds a strange and eerie dimension to the album as a whole. These songs have often been covered; to name just a few of my favorite interpretations: Sunday Morning by OMD, Waiting For The Man by John Cale and Nico on various of their solo albums, Femme Fatale by Propaganda, All Tomorrow's Parties by June Tabor, There She Goes Again by REM.<br /><br />The legacy of the VU, and of this album in particular, may be observed in the beautiful sonic sojourns of bands like inter alia Mercury Rev, My Bloody Valentine, Jesus and Mary Chain, Sonic Youth, Suicide and Swans. The Banana album remains a monument to the fierce spirit of rock 'n roll.
B00008BRDX|5.0|Although the arguments will continue for decades, to me this is the quintessential Police album and it always will be. It contains two of the band's best ever singles, \\"Message in a Bottle\\" and \\"Walking on the Moon\\", which both showcase the unique and wonderful sound of the trio at their finest. \\"Walking on the Moon\\", in particular, is a track unlike any pop song I've ever heard, with Andy Summer's otherworldly guitar accents and reggae riffs, Sting's unique vocal sound, and Stewart's clever echo-delayed rimclicks and playful high-hat work. The sense of space and atmosphere created on this track is amazing, and I remember it as the first Police song that truly caught my ear on the radio and made me pay attention to the band.<br /><br />\\"Bed's Too Big Without You\\" is another wonderful track, again showcasing the band's reggae influences while still showcasing their own unique style. \\"Bring on the Night\\" and \\"Deathwish\\" are two more Police gems, featuring great instrumentation and atmosphere.<br /><br />I will admit that part of why I am partial to this album is that I am a tremendous fan not just of Stewart Copeland's drumming but also his quirky songwriting. And yes, Reggatta De Blanc features more of his compositions than other Police albums, and they don't appeal to everyone. But I happen to love the sentiments and feelings of songs like his \\"Does Everyone Stare\\", the lyrics of which should ring true to anyone who has ever felt shy and awkward, unsure of him or herself particularly when it comes to love. \\"On Any Other Day\\" still brings a smile to my face after all of these years, and I enjoy the funky groove of \\"Contact\\" tremendously.<br /><br />With this album, it is easy to hear the Police making their way toward superstardom, yet remaining fresh and full of creative energy. It is still a vital and important album today, not dated even after twenty years. It's one of my \\"desert island discs\\" and for those who are only familiar with the Police through their singles, I strongly recommend this album for a more in-depth view of what they were capable of creating.singles, I strongly recommend this album for a more in-depth view of what they were capable of creating.
B0002ZDVEU|3.0|As a fan of the first film, The Bourne Identity, I had high hopes for this middle installment of Robert Ludlum's trilogy.  Sadly, director Paul Greengrass and cinematographer Oliver Wood failed to deliver. <br /> <br />Much of the film is just plain too dark to see.  Characters are often shot backlit against a window, and for some reason it never occured to Wood that he might have to throw a light on the foreground actor so we can actually see his face.  Instead we get a lot of unrecognizable silhouettes. <br /> <br />Greengrass is apparently of that school of directors that has never heard the words \\"tripod\\" or \\"SteadiCam\\".  The footage is so dizzying that you would have thought the cameraman was drunk during the entire shooting schedule.  SOME camera movement is fine during intense action sequences, but this film takes it to such extremes that the audience often cannot follow the action at all.  Edits are so tight that the viewer cannot orient himself to the new scene before he is whisked away to yet another which he cannot get a handle on.  As a result, the action sequences, especially the car chase scene through the streets of Moscow, are entirely incomprehensible. <br /> <br />My only other complaint is with the previews for this film, which made it out to be a cat and mouse game between Bourne and his former handlers.  I remember one specific scene where Julia Stiles' character says \\"He's doing exactly what he said he would do\\", referring to Bourne's warning in the first film that he would \\"bring this fight to your doorstep so fast\\" if they didn't let him be.  Yet that scene never made it into the final cut.  Yes, some of that cat and mouse does occur, but far less that you might expect.  The story is far more involved than we are led to believe, which is not necessaruily a bad thing, except when that story is told in the briefest glimpses by director Greengrass.  This is definitely one movie you'll have to watch about six times just to get the basics.  Sadly,that's not just because of the story's complexity - it's also because of Greengrass's very poor telling. <br /> <br />In the end, this film is definitely worth watching, but do so with some Pepto Bismal nearby, 'cause Greengrass' directing will definitely make you sick.  Identity's director Doug Liman, turned Executive Producer for Supremacy, should definitely take back the director's reins for the final Bourne installment.
B000089RVX|5.0|Few people were able to open their minds enough to really appreciate Evanescence. Most were quick to call the group copies of Lacuna Coil and Linkin Park. After listening a little of both of these, I see very little resemblance.  Aside from the fact that Evanescence and Lacuna Coil both are rock bands with female singers, there is not much in common. Amy Lee, the lead singer, has an incredible voice that is haunting, mesmerizing and beautiful. I would not call this group goth and I don't see how people can even call them metal, but their lyrics are pretty deep or at the very least, pretty and poetic. Most would expect rock-styled music to overshadow a female singer, however Amy holds her own quite nicely, shining particularly on piano ballads.  <br /> <br />The album kicks off with \\"Going Under\\", a dark, haunting song, which serves as an excellent introduction to the band's musical and lyrical styles. Amy's powerful vocals are showcased exceptionally in the chorus, while in the rest of the song she takes on a darker tone. \\"Bring Me To Life\\", a song I'm sure everyone knows, features Paul McCoy of 12 Stones. The song was featured on the Daredevil soundtrack and features more of Amy Lee's stunning vocals. The lyrics are astonishing, especially when compared to most of the other material from the same time period. \\"Everybody's Fool\\", a song that I misinterpreted until it became a single, follows in the same vein. I always thought the song was about someone from the \\"in-crowd\\", however the video showed a different interpretation: a song about self-hate (in a way). The song seems to be describing someone who acts differently to the point where they are unrecognizable from their old self.  <br /> <br />\\"My Immortal\\", the first piano-ballad, is definitely a highlight (even though every song is excellent). The song talks about a lost loved one (it seems to be in the sense that someone has died), and as hard as you try to move on, you find that the person is still with you and yet you are still alone. It also tells about how the person's spirit is still with you. (\\"I've tried so hard to tell myself that you're gone, but though you're still with me I've been alone all along\\"). \\"Haunted\\" is nothing short of creepy. Amy's vocals are layered (so that you can hear both high notes and low ones at once) and the lyrics really add to the effect. (\\"Watching me, wanting me. I can feel you pull me down.\\"). This is the first of several dark songs and it definitely proves that the band can do the style well. \\"Tourniquet\\", a song about suicide and salvation, is written incredibly and performed even better. The bridge in particular sounds amazing (especially the \\"my suicide...\\" part).  <br /> <br />\\"Imaginary\\" is a slower song, though a different version than the one that appeared on Evanescence's virtually unknown debut \\"Origin\\". The song has a mysterious, atmospheric kind of tone. It seems to be talking about creating an imaginary world to escape from the pain of reality. (\\"I know well what lies beyond my sleeping refuge, the nightmare I built my own world to escape\\"). The bridge is exceptional as well (including the musical break right before it). \\"Taking Over Me\\" is another of my favourites. This desperate, longing love song has heartbreaking lyrics, even though it is not a ballad. Amy's emotive delivery of the powerful lyrics truly makes this song exceptional. The same can be said for \\"Hello\\", a piano-ballad that is as good as (if not better than) \\"My Immortal. The lyrics are confusing, yet beautiful and the delivery is once again extraordinary. The entire song is haunting and melancholy, but the bridge truly stands apart. (\\"Suddenly I know I'm not sleeping, hello I'm still here. All that's left of yesterday\\"). The soaring vocals in this part truly show off the power of Amy's voice. <br /> <br />I do not understand why there are such split opinions over \\"My Last Breath\\". Some love it, and others find it dreadfully mediocre. Amy's vocals are once again showcased, and the lyrics are simply stunning. The lyrics paint an extremely clear mental picture of what the song is about (\\"Hold on to me love, you know I can't stay long. All I wanted to say was I love you and I'm not afraid\\"). As evocative as all of the songs are, to me this is one of the most powerful. Lastly, there is \\"Whisper\\", which was also on the \\"Origin\\" album. The second verse (\\"I'm frightened by what I see...\\") sounds particularly beautiful. The choir vocals in the background, as well as the Latin chant, add a great deal to the song. Lyrically, this song does not speak to me as much as most of the others, but it is great nonetheless. <br /> <br />Overall Mark: 5/5 <br /> <br />Few people, as I've already mentioned, were willing to accept Evanescence. Instead, they settled for labelling the band as unoriginal and manufactured. Those that are willing to give the band a try are likely to enjoy the deep lyrics, incredible vocals, and darker rock-styled music. I disagree with reviewers who believe and \\"teenager with angst can write like this\\" because frankly, its not true. Any teenager with angst can write about these concepts, sure, but it will definitely not be this calibre of writing. I also do not understand how this is a Christian band (not referring to the religion of the members, but to the music they make). Only one song (\\"Touniquet\\") has any remotely Christian references. However, the thing that puzzles me the most is how people can deny that Amy Lee has an incredible voice. Like the band or not, Amy is a talented vocalist who's voice actually suits the style she sings. Overall, Evanescence's commercial debut (they actually already had an album \\"Origin\\", which is virtually impossible to find) is truly exceptional. People really should give this album a fair chance. I think they'll be surprised. <br />
B0006399FS|2.0|I just remember something different is all. <br />Like most of ya, right? <br />The truth is, the album sounds bland because it...sounds like...U2. <br />U2 isn't a band anymore, folks.  They're a genre.  Secular bands (and unfortunately 9,458 Christian ones) have imitated the echoed epic themes that U2 immortalized and perfected before they were of legal drinking age.  They have earned their place in rock history and deservedly so.  Bono is impossibly entertaining, despite his struggles againt vague terms like \\"terrorism\\".  Maybe next they'll try and save us from \\"ennui\\"... <br />The point remains the same as it was since rock music began.  You can't have a Nirvana without a Nickelback, and you can't have a U2 without a million other imitators and 5th generation ripoffs... <br />So U2 is an expiring sound.  Yes'm it's true.  U2 has become Aerosmith.  Iggy Pop.  Paul McCartney.  It's just not exciting anymore. <br /> <br />It just hurts all the more growing up with a band that meant so bloody much to me.  A band that played at Mangia's pizza parlour in Austin, TX in 1980 to a crowd of 20-something people who had no earthly idea what would spring from these 4 kids...TEENAGERS...that revolutionized alternative rock and post punk. <br /> <br />I will not bash this album.  The album is better than 80% of what gets released these days. <br /> <br />But to fans that knew them THEN...it's not enough!  If anyone watched them on TV in 1980 playing \\"11 O' Clock Tick Tock\\" on the show, The Old Grey Whistle Test, then you know how phenomenal U2 was...as Bono nervously sang the words \\"Seen it all...seen it all before\\"  The song was a testament expressing his hatred of genres that lose their fire and meaning... <br /> <br />How ironic. <br /> <br />As forgetable as U2 has been since the mid 90s, there is no way in hell anyone can forget just how amazing this band was when it really mattered.

B0000VCZK2|5.0|Excellent. Hours and hours of suspenseful entertainment. And that's just the movies (original release & director's cut). There are hours of behind the scenes features and cast interviews. In a way, they take away a bit of the fear the alien inspires. When you see how they do what they do, it's much less creepy, and still, pretty amazing.<br /><br />I'm really squeamish these days, but for some reason, I still like this series. Maybe because there is less gore (though still some) and more that leads up to the implication of it.<br /><br />My favorite is Aliens (Alien 2). I just like the Ripley and Newt interaction. Mom protecting her new young. How sweet. (then you see #3...oh no!)<br /><br />I know \\"it's just a movie\\" but after watching these movies back to back to back to back (we had an Alien marathon, it was great!), what struck me most was how \\"the company\\" and these \\"aliens\\" just ruined this woman's life. And afterlife... so to speak. I wouldn't want some company to have that kind of power over anyone. (but do they anyway to a lesser degree? hmm...)<br /><br />As for entertainment, if you like Alien (1-4), and you like director's cuts, commentary, behind the scenes \\"how they did that\\" and \\"who did it,\\" plus additional goodies like story boards, photos, and whatever easter eggs are present and yet unfound (by me anyway), you just might like this 9 dvd set. A lot.<br /><br />One minor but important detail... the packaging. Though sleek and quite compact, it isn't the most secure. So be careful when you first open it. Accordion folds and loosely glued plastic holders make it very easy to drop one.
B0002Z0EYK|5.0|I don't understand the lukewarm critical and to some degree public reception to \\"Troy\\".  I attribute it to some degree with the liberties I am told were taken by the filmmakers with Homer's \\"The Iliad\\".  I wouldn't know since I slept through this portion of world cultures class when I was in school.  My teachers just couldn't make it as engaging as Wolfgang Petersen has here.  Alot of the invective was also directed at Brad Pitt's performance as Achilles.  This role is a no-win situation for Pitt.  How do you portray the greatest warrior the world has known without appearing to be a bit preening and narcissistic?  Director Petersen has staged here an impressive spectacle indeed.  The sprawl of this film takes your breath away.  The battle scenes are as impressive as anything this side of \\"Braveheart\\".  The spectacle would be nothing, however, if the characters were overwhelmed by the proceedings.  Fortunately, this film contains a number of wonderful performances.  Special citation has to go to Eric Bana who gives a star-making performance as Hector.  Bana more than holds his own, sometimes dominating, the more seasoned pros he is working with.  Peter O'Toole as Priam can still command the screen forty years after \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\" with that unmistakable voice and those intense eyes.  Newcomer Rose Byrne as Briseis, niece of Priam, is an engaging actress.  I found myself more attracted to her character than I was to Diane Kruger as Helen, the beauty that launched a thousand ships.  If you're looking for entertainment that will also offer food-for-thought then \\"Troy\\" is the film for you.
B00007ELEL|5.0|Jeff Bridges as the Dude Lebowski and John Goodman as his shaken Vietnam-vet-friend make this movie my all time favorite. Two freaks on the search for a kidnapped porn starlet and a very worn rug. Sometimes close to slapstick, then again almost realistic; simply fantastic!!! To me it has the best of all the Coen films combined into one. It's less violent than f.e. \\"Fargo\\" and less floating and innocent than \\"O Brother, Where Art Thou?\\" The script is a masterpiece, combining great dialogue while at the same time leaving the actors enough space to develop and add their own details to the characters. The combination is awesome. Comedy at its best!!!
B000089RVX|5.0|Evanescence take a place in Rock music that is hard to catogorise. The are really gothic yet most of their pieces have prolific orchestral arrangements mainly thnks 2 lead singer Amy Lee. <br />But the orchestral side of things doesn't really deter you at all. <br />It adds to the overall quirky beauty of the album. <br />They do everything well from ballads to Hard Rock with relative ease. <br />Bjork seems to be Amy's main inspiration as she can act and sound like her at times. <br />This album takes risks and thats a maindraw card. <br />Rarely these days do we see Rock albums taking risks. <br />They usually rely on their trademark riffs and attitude. <br />Evanescence make this beautiful and serene which is endangered for the Rock Genre. <br />
B00005YW4H|2.0|It's funny, other people say that this wasnt what they were expecting in terms of where she came from, and I agree. <br />This really isnt following in the footsteps of the legend of Ravi. A few musician friends said they saw her, and that she was very uninspired. I mean, for people who listen to Dildo or the like, I can imagine this being just what they've always wanted. For a daughter of Ravi Shankar, I'm very dissapointed that she took the easy way out.

B0006399FS|4.0|Seems like it's very popular to be sarcastic and negative about U2 these days. Admit it: you wouldn't be satisfied with ANYTHING they'd put out now. If they do another Achtung Baby, then why, if not, why not... Get over this cr@p and listen to the music. When I listen to an album, I don't flippin' care WHO the artists are, what they've done in the past or anything. I onnly care for the music on the disc. That's kinda the idea what Led Zeppelin tried to do when releasing their 4th album, they didn't want any name or whatever on it so that people care for the sounds they hear and ain't gonna compare it to the past or try to fit the album into the image they've created of a band, and call it a piece of junk if it doesn't fit... <br />So the thing is: I have no reasons to fight against the bashers, I can only say I love the music on this album.  <br />If you want to, go and listen to bands labelled \\"rebel\\" \\"fresh\\" \\"innovative\\" etc... I'll go and listen great music. <br />P.s.: my favourite is Miracle Drug

B0002NRRAG|5.0|An 8-year hiatus after her successful Dreamland, Madeleine Peyroux releases Careless love - an intoxicating mix of the great works by American songsmiths such as Bob Dylan and Leonard Cohen. Peyroux's husky mellow tone resembles the likes of Billie Holliday but her clear diction and French inflection elicits a tender blend of romance, vulnerability and sensuality, giving her a style of her own. Some of the best tracks includes her interpretation of Cohen's Dance Me to the end of the world, the poignant Between the Bars, J'ai Deux Amors and the melancholic Weary Blues. The earthy instrumentation by Larry Goldings puts the focus on Peyroux's unique vocals and beckons the listener to the nostalgic 1930s era. Peyroux's hard work has paid off in every sense - making this one of the best blues album in 2004. With each listen, the mood of the album grows on the listener like vintage wine.
0790732254|5.0|The drama \\"Who's afraid of Virginia Woolf?\\", written by Edward Albee, has quite a simple topic: problems in a marriage. The protagonists, the elder couple Martha and George and the young couple Honey and Nick, meet after a faculty party at Martha and George's house. <br />It's in the middle of the night, they're drunk and the hosts involve their guests more and more in their marriage problems by playing games like \\"Humiliate the Host\\" or \\"Hump the Hostess\\". The bad relationship of Martha and George gets clear easily because they humiliate and insult each other all the time. <br />The dialogues are written in a funny and descriptive tone, so that reading stays interesting from the first to the last page. <br />But the movie by Mike Nichols definitly fulfills the expectations of the reader.  <br />The movie convinces by well-chosen actors who embody their roles perfectly. <br />I recommend the book and the movie because I enjoyed reading and watching them. It's worth it.
0060512806|4.0|Composed of three - at times four, even five - plotlines, each with its own narrator; spanning sixty years and told in two distinct time frames; exploring naval warfare, cryptology, the psychology of geeks, and Greek mythology; topping eleven hundred pages in length - this is not a novel for the faint-hearted.  It's long and impressively - even confusingly - complex, and sometimes the reading is a bit of a slog.  But the stories are intricately interwoven and surprisingly funny; the characters are unique, believable, and memorable; the digressions into science, religion, and everything else are knowledgeable and clearly presented - on the whole this is a very enjoyable read.  Totally worth the investment.
B00023BLXK|1.0|I don't see how anyone could even think this movie was better than the first one.  This wasn't a sequel either, it was more of a re-make, latin-style.  The acting was poor, the dancing stunk (what little bit there was), especially since they used the same dance as was used in the original Dirty Dancing, they just added a couple latin moves.  There was very little \\"heat\\" between the characters during the dancing, it lacked emotion.  Like another reviewer mentioned, using the revolution as a backdrop seemed forced and flaccid.  Thankfully it wasn't a long movie.  Myself being a former dancer/choreographer, I was looking forward to a great high energy dancing movie, especially with how sexy latin dancing is, I was very disappointed and very glad that I didn't pay theater prices to see it!
B00065GX64|5.0|<br />I've just now (minutes ago) finished seeing this film for the first time.   <br /> <br />I'm awestruck. <br /> <br />Had this film been made by anyone other than Fritz Lang I'd have thought it impossible in the context of a film circa 1931.  Peter Lorre's performance as a child murderer is incredible.  His pleas for mercy when being \\"tried\\" by the underworld bosses is amazing.  The director spends an entire film making you hate his character and in a matter of seconds, Peter Lorre makes you understand the pathos, the compulsion, the madness that drives him to do what he does.  He relates real pain, real self hatred and true madness.  The cinematography is PERFECT.  Every aspect is flawless.  All this from a film made nearly three quarters of a century ago. <br /> <br />It's in German.  Subtitles.  Big deal.  If you're even looking at this, you need to see it, period.
B00000I14Z|5.0|If you own one work by Mingus this must be it. Mingus if he did nothing else, really showcased the art of Jazz as 'composition'. <br /> <br />These tunes here are so well thought out, so structured, you so full of improvisation and free at the same time. I really wish Mingus would have played Boogie Stop Shuffle more often (like he did with Better Git...). <br /> <br />Every song on here is just excellent, Mingus really makes the most of his 'big band' sound here, giving the music great dynamics and shadings.
0375422889|5.0|Sent to Austria in 1984 at the age of 14, to escape the repression of fundamentalist Islamic revolution in Iran, Marjane Satrapi creates a graphic novella of her misadventures .  <br /> <br />The tone of the work in Persepolis 2 is often humorous, but the subject matter is serious. Graphics and text layer the novel with innuendo, understatement, and irony--powerful strategies to enter difficult, confrontational situations.  <br /> <br />This interplay between graphics and text blocks also allows the author to explore ways that illusion or dream world differ from external reality. The universal themes of coming-of-age in an imperfect world, or of returning \\"home\\" after living away are especially powerful here. The narrator invites the reader to share intimate details of her life as she moves from teenage years of minimal rules and zero supervision back to a society where women are veiled and culture is censored. <br /> <br />Highly recommended--along with volume 1: Persepolis-- for High School reading lists, and for anyone wanting an excellent window into another culture and way of life.
B0000AUHQT|4.0|After Years since our first Encounter, I was keenly surprised at the Graphic Descriptions of that Time-frame of Newly Rich among the HAVES and Inner Longings of those who were the Have-Nots!     Barbara and I were Amazed at the Sweep of Acting Ability of Mia Farrow and Bruce Dern! Not nearly as much difference in Redford! If you compare their High-riding parties with the entertainment of today, here were grand displays of emotions and kicking-up of their heels, almost like the Cotton Club or the Blue Note in Chicago!     We were more interested in the music & costumes than Acting or Story plot. There was contrast of the leading characters in their super display of emotions compared to that restraint of Nick Carraway, Tom Buchanan, or the mechanic named Wilson! What an awesome diplay of Personality Contrasts as well as, the short conversational exchanges that were both snide and more cynical than chit-chat between Gatsby and Tom Buchanan!!    All-in-all we were not entirely in the dark with the depression of the ending yet the Narrator, SAM WATERSON, as Nick C. had all the necessary qualities of being Worthy of an Oscar! Never   was it an appetizing, inspiring of high hopes, or sentimental movie as was our recent viewing of The Thomas Crown Affair!  Retired Chaplain Fred W  Hood
076790592X|5.0|Your relationships matter most, with you family and your friends.  This books talks about Morrie, the author's college professor.  I think Morrie loved Mitch a lifetime before Mitch finally came around.  This is one of the few books that made me happy and made me weep with tears and sobbing at the same time.  Mitch goes to Morrie's house when he finds out that Morrie has ALS and visits every Tuesday out of his busy schedule.  Morrie is a hero.  Mitch learns many of life's lessons at the bedside of Morrie.  Human dignity was never greater than recorded here in this book.  A must read for those with ill loved ones and to those who need a purpose to this life.
0553103547|5.0|This isn't a review of Game of Thrones so much as the series. A Song of Ice and Fire is brilliatly written and masterfully done. I can only think of one other fantasy series I like as much. As a reader who started with the series when it first came out the wait has been long but always worth it in the end.
B00006LLNU|5.0|I have a rather large library of music and have listened to much, much more music than I own. I spend at least 5 hours a day listening to music, and I love nearly every genre. Of course, the topic of \\"favorite album\\" comes up often in my mind, and for a while it was unclear. Shpongle's Tales of the Inexpressible and Radiohead's Kid A were usually battling for the top spot, but little did I know that the dark horse from Iceland would claim the prize. <br /> <br />To those who are unaware, yes the CD is essentially in \\"gibberish\\" (Hopelandic to be precise), yes it takes a while to grow on you, and no, it's not pretentious. This is not the \\"emperor's clothes\\" artsy coffee shop Pitchfork media record you buy to stay hip (although it could be). This is a beautiful, lush, and wonderful piece of art, an outer-wordly, artic journey, a soundscape to really savor. <br /> <br />() is divided into two parts, and none of the tracks have titles. The first part is the \\"soft\\" side; the second the harder side. The entire CD flows together, although the sides could be listened to seperately. Sometimes its hard to tell which song is playing, but it doesn't matter. It's one experience. <br /> <br />Thus, the key to () is not to casually listen to the album, but to intently experience it. If not for the whole album, at least during a song, really dive into the sound. Cleanse your mind, breathe away your thoughts on everything but the sound. No matter how many times you've heard the album, it will surely mesmerize you. I would recommend meditating to it; this is the way I listen to it now, although any close, personal listening of this album is worthwhile. <br /> <br />This CD is also great background music. Its sound is entertaining, beautiful and strange, yet not overwhelming; it spurs creativity rather than hinders it. The \\"gibberish\\" singing provides inspiration instead of clouding your head with words. <br /> <br />If you still aren't convinced enough to buy the album, download it,burn it, and listen to it for a week or two. I'm sure you've start the path to loving this strange and intimate album.
0375422307|5.0|Marjane Satrapi was eleven years old when the Islamic revolution ousted the Shah, sending Iran into another era of turmoil and new forms of repression. Persepolis is her story, told in short pieces that weave personal experience with historical facts.  <br />The graphic frames provide a humorous counterpoint to darker episodes described by text. For example, on page 3, the text reveals: \\"Then came 1980: the year it became obligatory to wear the veil at school.\\" The artwork in the frames show a scattering of small girls who are playing with their veils, using them as monster masks, horse bridles for piggy-back games, or even tying them together for jump rope.  <br />On a darker note, a friend of the family named Ahmadi never returned from jail. As the family is told, \\"In the end he was cut to pieces,\\" (52), the frame shows a child's paper doll-like figure, separated into pieces of torso and each limb.  <br />Highly recommended for adults, and for adolescents who want to discover the way of life in other cultures, other times. For anyone trying to make sense of difficult political situations and / or cultural repressions. <br />Marjane Satrapi is an important international voice, finally available in translation.
B000002B2T|4.0|If you are an Alice fan, or a fan of 90s grunge, or a rock fan, this is an album you need to have in your collection. Few \\"supergroups\\" have come through for us the way Mad Season did with Above. No one that I've turned onto this CD has been disappointed.  The thick layers peel away to reveal real soul. Soul in the music; soul in the musicianship; soul in the lyrics; most definitely, soul in the voice. Layne is as distinct as ever here. The elements come together greater than the sum of the parts (yeah, corny) but it's the truth. Above is an album that I've been listening to for a decade and it still holds water. If that's not the test of a truly great rock album, ask me again in another decade. I'll still likely be spinning \\"Long Gone Day.\\"
B00005OWEG|2.0|I'm sorry but I just don't get it.<br /><br />This is a long movie<br /><br />This is a boring movie<br /><br />I could never understand why people got so into this flick. I find it a great chore to sit through.
B000089J0R|5.0|The musical techniques, tempos and time signitures on this album are just phonominal. They are out of this world music. Even though the tempo may be at about 220, they do not hesitate but push that tempo to the limit by playing sixteenths on their guitars and drums. The music is very well written, and even though you will constintly have guitars blasting and drums pounding, it isn't like some death metal bands out there who play random notes and have a singer who sounds like he is constipated with rabid weasles attached to his armpits while his head is on fire. It is completly different. The music is modern, fits nicley in the Power Metal genere, but also has a singer who is a tenor, with a wide range and also brings an 80's feel to the music. It is great music, and I recommend it to all rock lovers out there, no matter what genere of rock you like the best.
B0000584V3|5.0|If I could give \\"Blackwater Park\\" more than a measly 5 stars, I would. Opeth is easily one of the greatest bands to ever walk the stage. Even if you're not into death metal, one can still appreciate the sheer musical prowess these Swedes possess. I've had  people who can't STAND death metal (I'm a big fan) say that Opeth somehow \\"gets away\\" with the guttural vocals and brutal guitar riffs. Of course, many hauntingly beautiful acoustic sessions interweave with all this, and it actually works. A buddy of mine who saw them live with me said Opeth reminded him of the old Black Sabbath in reference to their demeanor, musicanship, and pure presence.<br /><br />\\"Blackwater Park\\" is the essential Opeth album. Everything here is done right. From the opener \\"Leper Affinity\\" to the last second of the CD, Opeth takes you on a cold and awe-inspiring journey. Few bands today can project the raw power and emotion that Opeth produces as if it were easy and natural as breathing. Anyone with a vested interest in music, and especially aspiring musicians, will definetely want to check this album out. An absolute classic.<br /><br />Oh, and on a side note, people should ignore this \\"Avril Lavinge's #1 fan\\" guy. Its apparent this dude is a fan of death metal and the underground scene. Why would he write all these reviews of metal? Just some guy out for attention and kicks. I think some of his stuff is funny (for being so blatantly stupid) but the act is wearing thin. If you need proof, click on his name and read some of the other reviews he wrote.
140004281X|5.0|There is one story of mother and daughter that will absolutely nail your heart to the wall, especially if you are a parent.  I won't go into detail, of course, but there is nothing unrealistic or sappy here.  In fact, the stories are so well told, so real, that you walk away enhanced, you understand life a little better and you will be more careful in your relationships with family and friends.  You also may feel a kinship with Canada and a life so opposite of Hollywood America.  I ordered five more Munro books.
B0000026VZ|3.0|One thing that really annoys me about these so called \\"Greatest Hits\\" collections is that they leave out some key hits and replace them with songs never before released.  Now, I don't want to confuse favorite tracks with actual hits, so lets stick to the hits that are missing from this collection. <br />Songs like 1984's Stranger In Town, or 1978's I'll supply the love.  There was also Why Don't We Make Believe from the TOTO IV album.  This is a fairly good collection of hits.  But a word to other groups.  Try to put all of the actual hits on a disc.  Then, if there's room left over, put some of the more popular album tracks that were not released as singles.  It's time for another TOTO CD that deserves the title of Greatest Hits.
0375703764|1.0|I unfortunatly read this book a few years back based on a few friends praises, which I later realized were based mostly on the type setting. I for a long time thought this was another case of a meaningless novel being touted based on a few gimmicks, some of which I found quite interesting, but despite the fact that the narrator repeatedly says the book will change your life, you can never quite figure out why. The book seemed like an poorly concieved horror novel, with no real feeling, written by an author with a flare for game-playing. In short, i didn't really take it seriously. <br /> <br />I have recently found out that the book is actually far worse than what I originally thought. I learned this based on the fact I discovered the writings of Jorge Luis Borges and Umberto Eco. For those who haven't read these two authors, Jorge Luis Borges is rightfully considered one of the greatest writers of the twentieth century, and has been called the greatest writer in the Spanish language since Cervantes. He wrote many many things (though never a novel) about the abundance of human learning, the maze of meanings, eternity, infinity, identity, and life, his favorite metaphor was that of the Labrynth. One can see through 'House of Leaves' use of this metaphor that the writer was no stranger to Borges'  writings... or perhaps he was.... I've become mostly convinced of this since I began reading Umberto Eco's \\"The Name of the Rose,\\" Eco is a very intelligent scholar, also obsessed with the complexity of meaning, and an admirer of Borges. His book \\"The Name fo the Rose\\" was largly inspired by Borgesian themes, and is an intelligent investigation of those themes. The book was also ripped off front to back in House of Leaves. The books are both fictions of discovered texts that inspire a writer to investigate a story that alludes them (the language is almost the same in some places), the manuscripts all base on trying to investigate a mystery at the center of which is a labrynth that inspires people to murder. <br /> <br />The largest difference between \\"The Name of the Rose\\" and \\"House of Leaves\\" is the noticable lack of content in \\"House of Leaves.\\" Whereas in \\"The Name of the Rose,\\" people are always discussing some aspect of knowledge, and the overall plot forwards the basic thematic core of the book, \\"House of Leaves\\" fails to develop a thematic core that is any deeper than the typesetting. <br /> <br />Borges often put forward the basic rule that he followed in his writing, that he never let the form get in the way of the thought behind it. I don't believe that House of Leaves is inspired by Borges because it does the exact opposite. <br /> <br />Simply my suggestion is that if you haven't read Borges, you do so before House of Leaves. Borges is much easier reading, and you will get a lot more out of it. <br />And anyone who has read Borges should know that there are a million things that need to be read before this book
B000002MP2|5.0|For as far back as I can remember, maybe when I was 8 or 9, I became a HUGE fan of Green Day after I saw the UNBELIEVINGLY powerful video on MTV for \\"Longview.\\"  Billie Joe was rockin' hard, tearing the s--- out of that crappy old couch, and just trying to break free from the ALL TOO FAMILIAR phase we go through at one point or the other: boredom!  I am now almost 20 yaers old, and GD is STILL AND ALWAYS WILL BE my all time fav. band!!!!!!  They're so important to me because they were the first band I really started getting into, back in '94.  This CD is and WILL ALWAYS( I emphasize ALWAYS!)be at the top, on the first slot of the FIRST PAGE of my CD case.  When I was a younger guy, I instantly fell in love with this girl and it was the BEST friggin' year of my life, man.('94) There are SO many excellent songs on this album I can relate to love, relationships, friendships, and sometimes even dysfunctional emotional pain and burdens that singer Billie Joe recites in some of the best songs on here( Ex: Longview, WTP, Basket Case, She, and ALL the others that finish up the album.  I have criticized this band to be THE BEST damn punk band on the face of this earth, and you just might, too, but YOU have to judge for yourself.  Do you want Green Day to change and be apart of your life?  You make the choice to pick this CD up or not and one more thing- IGNORE THE BAD REVIEWS!!!
B00021R7CG|1.0|For anyone who has a real interest in the subject, this movie is quite simply awful.  But then again, that's what I usually expect of movies of this genre.  Absolutely no understanding of how the political control actually works.  The Secretary of the Interiior walks on a plane and all of a sudden he's Mr. President but doesn't know what the proper procedures are?  Allows everyone to argue with him, not a single civilian advisor anywhere on the aircraft or that he can contact?  And isn't even sworn in?  Please.   Nobody can find a single other cabinet secretary or individual in the line of successsion when they are tracked 24hrs a day?  No civilian members of the National Security Council anywhere to be found or even mentioned.  CIA, NSA, DIA, National Security Advisor, Congress?  Not even suggested that they exist.  And of course aside from the one senior officer who doesn't want to do this all the other senior military officers are hot to blow up the world.  Um, that's actually backward.  The senior officer's jobs are to keep the President calm and offer all possible alternatives.  Instead, it's damn the torpedoes, let's go blow up the Russkies!!!  And don't get me started on the \\"the subs are out of communication range for the next 8 hours Mr. President\\".  Utter and complete nonsense.  Designed to build suspense and make the average viewer think that this sort of thing is possible.  Oh, yes, and let's not forget the 'automated response to a nuclear attack' the Russians supposedly have.  Suicidely vulnerable to a computer virus, anyone?  Or perhaps a stray missile somebody somehow bypassed all the locks on, smuggled out of the country and fired from Turkey?  The dissidents want to take over the country and are going to do it by starting a nuclear war and wiping it out?  Who are they going to rule over?  Cockroaches? <br />  The film's only redeeming feature?  James Earl Jones.  I didn't believe anyone else in that film was even remotely real or even trying to act.At least that man was convincing. <br />  Other than that, the movie is terrible.  Of course the B-52 crew start to crack up, ejecting out of the airplane, ignoring procedure, using a nuclear bomb to blow up a couple of Russian fighters that are so close they can shoot at them with machine guns.  Silly.  The Russian President talking to the American President when no-one else in the country can find him, to put it mildly, beggars belief.  I could list all of the problems with this film, but just won't bother.  If you have any real interest in the subject, steer clear of this one.
0316168815|3.0|I couldn't put this book down. However, I tired of the reflections of the past. I got to the point where I would skip over those parts and read on. I also felt 3/4 of the way through the book the plot began to unravel. I wasnt' crazy about the ending. I wanted the murderer to get caught although it was very interesting of how he moved on and the discovery of other girls he had killed. All in all, I would give it 3.5 stars.
B00006I53S|5.0|I purchased this along with my Canon EOS Digital Rebel. Probably the most versatile lens you could buy, covering about 95% of the range one would ever use.  The quality of this lens makes the 18-55mm lens almost obsolete.  Although this is somewhat pricey, it is well worth the money.  Canon lenses are always top-notch and compatibility with your digital camera is assured.  Be sure to purchase from a reputable retailer so that you get a USA warranty.   You should never compromise quality, otherwise you'll regret getting something that wasn't the best.  Your camera is expensive, and your memories are priceless -- why short change both with a second rate camera lens?
0451191153|5.0|Rarely does one come across a work of such fervid ideological passion.  Written on mild amphetamines by a Russian migr who saw her family ruined by the Bolsheviks, Rand's immensely successful novel is less an articulation of a specific philosophy (as it is generally advertised) than it is a dramatic attack on Marxist ideas (collectivism, altruism, \\"dialectical materialism\\").  Her celebration of individualism is overranked and her notions of selfishness as a high ideal are misplaced.  Perhaps if she defined more strictly selfishness within an aesthetic context, or used the term \\"self-centered\\" in its place (for selfishness implies a consideration of self to the detriment of others) her argument would be more palatably logical.  We might also add that there is altogether too much laughing, smiling, inner knowing, too many speeches that sound the same, too much dialogue that doesn't fit the mouths of its characters, and repetitive, declarative syntax that absolutely CLUNKS.  Nevertheless, this is a great novel for its dynamic spirit and its towering archetypal characters, which clash and collide wonderfully about.  I first read The Fountainhead when I was eighteen, and in many ways I am still influenced by Howard Roark, the uncompromising architect and hero of this novel (the book ends and begins with his name).  Rereading Fountainhead thirty years later I still find it compelling and even motivating.  Rand was an atheist, but her God was Art, and her Satan was any system that organized against Art to protect its own mediocrity and power, an observation as fresh today as it was a century ago. <br /> <br />
0790732254|4.0|In the movie Who's afraid of Virginia Woolf\\" the main characters Martha (Elizabeth Taylor) and George (Richard Burton) clearly demonstrate the failure of their marriage and shock with reality that totally opposes the ideal of the American Dream. At a little party with lots of drinking they expose their most private secrets to their guests Nick (George Segal) and Honey (Sandy Dennis). The brilliant dialogues between the characters express the dashed hopes of living an All American life with success and happiness and the desire to take revenge on the partner for ruining this dream. The actors do an excellent job playing their roles effectively and close to reality to make this movie convincing and worth watching.
B000002PH1|5.0|Former Go-Go's vocalist's second solo in 1987 is truly the album made in heaven. It is also well-produced one. Title track HEAVEN IS A PLACE ON EARTH became #1 so this album has been remembered by this huge hit but album has more of great sing-along tracks. Started her music career as a punker some of the track choice is really punkish as shown in I FEEL FREE or NOBODY OWNS ME. GO-GOs styled FOOL FOR LOVE will get your feet dancing. Great songwriters adds the album grace such as Diane Warren penning I GET WEAK which became another huge hit.<br /><br />Must-have album for female vocalist connoisseurs and highly recommended for Avril Lavigne, Michelle Branch, Carly Simons<br /><br />and Alanis Morissette fans.
B00005JN4O|4.0|Johnny Depp is very believable in this film as J.M. Barrie.  The combination of period costume and computer graphics to capture the magic of \\"Neverland\\" as it fills Barrie's and the adopted family's imagination is near brilliant. <br /> <br />Kate Winslett and the boy who plays Peter turn in excellent performances. <br /> <br />
B00018D44U|5.0|I listen to really terrible heavy metal, but I admit that I love this CD. I don't know if it's jazz or folk, I just know there is a very homey feel to it. When I listen to it, I feel like I'm relaxing in a bed somewhere with a girl I love. There's a big pitcher of iced tea on the table and the window's open. It's a beautiful day outside and the birds are just singing on the tree branch. When I listen to it, I feel like a little baby in my mother's arms.
B0002OERI0|4.0|I'm going to assume the \\"Jeremy\\" review below this is a joke and I won't touch it with a 40 foot pole.  For those of you who did read it and actually believed it, Green Day is from California and this is an anti-Bush album, not an anti-America album.  Get it straight. <br /> <br />As far as the songs go, the Jesus of Suburbia cycle is amazing, as well as the next few tracks (Holiday and Boulevard, which i'm sure you've all heard by now).  The album does kind of die off after this point, but with a few great rockers afterwards (St. Jimmy and She's a Rebel).  The more interesting part is the story going on throughout the album, highlighted by Jesus of Suburbia which makes it such a great track.  This is probably one of the better albums of 2004 (especially since I mostly listen to rock from the early 90s). <br /> <br />If you like this are looking for a modern punk album along the same anti-Bush lines as this, check out \\"The Empire Strikes First\\" by Bad Religion, probably a much better album than this one (and much more punk).
0385510454|1.0|If the early years of the 21st century are deserving of a time capsule, I recommend this book to sit front and center.  Future generations will marvel at how poor our literature was.  How this book could be a best seller is beyond comprehension.  It is testimony to the age of celebrity we live in that an author's name could carry such weight that a book this bad could be published, much less read by millions. <br /> <br />To call this a story is a gross exageration as there is no plot and no character development.  For over two hundred pages the author has the audacity to waste his readers time with translating basic phrases such as, 'Could I please have a cup of coffee?\\" into Italian.  And this is repeated ad nauseum until any reader would be capable of confusing his local Starbucks attendant for hours with requests for coffee, with or without sugar and cream, all in Italian. <br /> <br />One gets the idea that this author called this one in.  Somewhere, he has to be sitting back laughing that if people will buy material from an Italian-English dictionary, mixed with some musings from an Italian tour guide, then they will buy anything. <br /> <br />Given this author's desire to achieve the maximum number of words with the minimum amount or creative writing effort we can only look forward to his future books, \\"MSDOS for Idiots in Venice\\" and \\"The Encyclopedia Britanica, letters H-L, Tries to Murder the Pope\\". <br /> <br />If you ignore my warnings and purchase this book you are doing a great injustice to the tsunami victims who could have made much better use of the money.  After about three hundred pages of this disaster you will praying for a little hell or high water yourself!
B0002Y4T92|5.0|You've read all the reviews about what was left on the cutting floor, or who their favorite players were.  I'll spare you the duplication.  The bottom line is 99% of the performances are just outstanding and the musicianship is stellar. <br /> <br />DTS AUDIO = FINEST OF 60+ DVDs <br /> <br />Most of the tracks are mixed so well they make the majority of other DVD concerts sound sad in comparison. <br />Two tracks are the best audio mix I have ever heard for this genre on a DVD: <br /> <br />Track 17 Disc 1 - Jingo with Carlos Santana <br />Track 3 Disc 2 - Josie with Larry Carlton <br /> <br />Again, it seems every production I own with Clapton involved has this excellence in audio.  Crossroads may even beat my long-time Clapton favorite \\"One More Car, One More Rider\\" <br /> <br />VIDEO = OUTSTANDING QUALITY <br /> <br />Very high video resolution.  Widescreen format.  Looks as good as some of my Superbit movies.  Camera angles and video production are tasteful and appropriate (not too many fancy tricks or dizzyingly fast changes/sweeps).  Sometimes the camera is too close to enjoy the performer, just focusing on a guitar close-up...but I'm sure the guitarists watching love it. <br /> <br />I sincerely hope this DVD marks the beginning of a new standard for both Audio and Video.  If only every music concert DVD produced could look and sound this good! <br />
B000660UN0|2.0|To be honest I was disappointed.  I haven't listened that carefully to it so maybe I'll find something of interest and I haven't viewed the DVD that came with it yet. But I expected more Robert Johnson delta blues, just a solo unelectrified guitar and I got Eric Clapton sounding for the most part no different than he did when he was with Cream.  <br /> <br />I figured that after 35+ years of playing blues and r&r that he'd try--for an album like this--to play like a true bluesman and not let the electronics alone do his work for him.  On \\"Milkcow's Calf Blues\\" the piece starts out very RJ like and then ends up like Cream.  On \\"Terraplane Blues\\" where it is a good enough example of EC trying to approximate RJ the playing is dull. Compare it to the original. RJ slides, changes octaves and rhythms, features that blue note almost as a surprise just before the end of the chorus. Clapton tends to prepare us for it. \\"If I had Possession over Judgement Day\\" is a poor rendition of what RJ did. Clapton is repetitive and rock n roll like.  <br /> <br />Clapton's singing puts me to sleep. And that's really a shame because Johnson's singing is what matters more than the guitar playing.  Clapton doesn't convince me that he has troubles and is desirous of some control over his life the way Johnson does.  Johnson occassionally talks through a verse on most songs and that adds a dimension that is lacking in Clapton, though he tries it one song. In general a thing that Johnson does that Clapton can't or won't is the constant changing of vocalizations.  RJ's calls and responses are often in different voices.  <br /> <br />\\"Me and the Devil Blues\\" is a lot more Johnson like but Clapton's tempo increases and is uneven and it never seems to be where he started originally. Still does Clapton sound like a poor scared kid (a black kid in Jim Crow South who gets beaten up and his guitar smashed by cops) trying to earn a buck when he plays? The desperation that lives side by side with the I-can't-do-a-damn-thing-about-this attitude in the blues doesn't exist in Clapton's arrangements, I'm sorry to say. <br /> <br />This is not to say that RJ's music can't be re-arranged into a more modern sound or that other instruments can't be played to bring out the multiple colors that are heard in Johnson. Or for that matter that white people can't play the blues because it's an idiom that can be learned and interpreted by anyone who loves this music. It can be done and it probably should be done.  And I think Clapton can do some original blues work of his own. I have enjoyed some of his guitar work in the past though I think his singing is less than sterling.  He just completely misses the mark on this album.  <br /> <br />One last throught.  RJ's work was recorded in makeshift studios in hotel rooms and office buildings. Clapton's work was done in a modern recording studio.  The difference I think is that Johnson's little talk breaks, his vocalizations and guitar embellishments are carried over in these faux studio sessions from performances in front of people. There was some kind of a conversation going on and the memory of those are heard in the Johnson recordings. What Johnson probably did while playing was to find ways to please his audience.  There is little sense that Clapton is playing for an audience on this album. And that just makes it sterile. Or maybe a 60 year old well-off white guy just can't sound like a shy, black farm boy from Mississippi who ran the risk of getting his butt kicked whenever he went out for the night in a big town. Maybe there's something to that. . . <br />
B00006879E|5.0|ok. im a teenager. all my friends think this band/album is really gay. i for one have a VERY open mind in music. I loved Maroon 5 for a bit..then i started to get sing of them when they're songs were played out on the radio and tv.   <br /> <br />i have SEEN Maroon 5 live. I got the chance to go to one of their private concerts. they were amazing. i loved them ALL OVER AGAIN the instant they played. it was a great experience.On tv and radio, you dont really get to fully capture the greatness of their music.   <br /> <br />it made me realize: <br />1. Maroon 5 is far different from any rock band i kno. They're beats are jus so unique. and the way they blend theyre music 2gether is awesome! <br />2. They are unique! and its GREAT!  <br />3. Adam Levine's vocals... are awesome too!.  Theyre different!  <br /> <br />To fully appreciate the wonder of Maroon 5's album.. pop in the cd into a stereo... turn up the bass! turn up the volume... <br /> <br />or  <br /> <br />go to one of their concerts!  <br /> <br />Maroon 5 is one of those bands that we will remember. They will make their mark in music history. You just watch.  <br /> <br />
B00009V8Z9|5.0|I have to say, that I am not an easy customer when it comes to music. Yes, I do seem to like all types of music, but it seems that I never am able to find an ENTIRE c.d. that is worth buying. However, this c.d. is full of unique songs, with an original edge. DeGraw sings in such a clear sound, that you feel as if you are sitting next to him by the piano, while he is performing. This c.d. is unlike anyone I have ever heard before, it is perfect to listen to when you are trying to relax, study, or simply listen to music.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|I had heard about this for a few years but didnt know what it was about and just happened to rent it while passing by it in the rental store a couple months ago. I was expecting a thriller like most other thrillers (people run around, evil bunny rabbit or something etc) but I was soooooo wrong. This movie wasnt what I was expecting, it was better. The whole movie feels like a dream and its great sountrack only inhances this. The 80s songs are great and go perfect with every scene without being cheesy or anything. The story is unique the movie is beautifly shot. I just cannot say enough good things about this movie. Acting-Great. Music-Awesome. Story-Brilliant. I could go on. <br /> <br />The movie though isnt for everyone. You'll either hate it or love it. But you at LEAST have to give it a chance and watch it TWICE before you decide. The first time I saw it, I didnt know how to feel about it. All I knew was that I couldnt stop thinking about it and wondering what the heck I just watched. So I watched it again, still didnt get it but I really liked alot better the second time. In my opinion, the movie just keeps getting better everytime you watch it. You notice new things, you make up new thoeries, and you understand it a little better each time. I finally had to buy the movie after I couldnt stop thinking about it and Ive watched it at least 12 times since Ive gotten it the day before Christmas and Im still not tired of it.  <br /> <br />Im not usually one who would like a movie like this but just something about it that really grabs me and stuff that I cant stop watching it. When Im not watching it, Im thinking about it. <br /> <br />Great great awesome movie.
B000002KHH|5.0|Black Sabbath's reputation as a influential metal band has been inflated somewhat nowadays, particularly of Mr. Osbourne'e unexplicable presence on MTV. Yet, despite many people shouting out \\"just how great the original lineup\\" is, there is some truth to Black Sabbath's support. Paranoid, for example is a perfect example of what a band can do when all four collective minds are pulled together in order to create a cohesive piece of great music.    Despite having only eight songs, there is a lot to like in Paranoid. The opener War Pigs, with lyrics that are applicable in today's society, sounds as good as ever. The title track, despite being heavily recycled through classic rock radio, is quick burst of furious eneregy channeled through bass and distorted guitar. The rest of the songs are of course, equally powerful, as each one offers a distict yet similar taste of molten classic metal. Even now, Paranoid sounds as agressive as ever, particularly with a music scene saturated with artists who rely more on image than on substance.    And that's probably why Paranoid holds up well today. Black Sabbath was a real band with real problems. A perfect way for them to exerocise their demons was through this record, as it perfectly sums up what is so great about this band. Great tunes, great lyrics and great performances are what Paranoid is made of. Plus, many others have looked to this one as a stepping stone for their own musical agends. Paranoid is an essential record for the very reason that it reminds us of a time when music was valued based on merit and power, rather than aches and fashion.     Black Sabbath would continue on to make more music, from the from powerful Master of Reality, to the experimental Sabbath Bloody Sabbath. While many people will see black sabbath as \\"the band that has Ozzy!!!\\", others will see them as the one of the most important bands to walk the earth.
B0001ZX0OW|4.0|Finally got to check out this movie, Mystic River is a movie where the sum does not equal its parts.  The strong screenplay, script and cinematography are effective in portraying the gritty neighborhoods of Boston but I still found something to be missing.  Standout performances by Sean Penn, Tim Robbins and Marcia Gay Harden were still spotty.  At times I felt that members of this ensemble cast were trying to outshine each other leading to less than convincing scenes.  Perhaps as an native New Englander, I found the attempts at a Bawhstan accent to be a bit amusing at times, the actors were not even in the bawlpahk...      But I did enjoy the movie from beginning to end despite it's inconsistencies.  The darkness and drama let up to a satisfying and sad conclusion though I did find the last 5 minutes of the ending to be a bit odd.  Though in truth, the tough neighborhoods of Boston (South Boston for example) do have their own unwritten codes and rules which this movie did it's best to portray.  Overall Mystic River gets my thumbs up but wish it could have been a bit more realistic...
B000002UW1|4.0|Chronologically, Document was the first R.E.M. album I was not crazy about.  For the first time, there were more than two or three songs I did not like. These songs I despised so much that I leaped towards the fast-forward button as soon as they invaded my mini boombox.   <br /> <br />Even though I was a history buff and would take extra time teaching McCarthyism to my class during my brief teaching career, I could not stand the track \\"Exhuming McCarthy.\\"  It is too noisy with too much going on and an annoying horn section.  Joseph McCarthy, of course, was the Senator from Wisconsin who almost single-handedly put the nation through a Communist scare in the 1950s.  I'm not sure if, lyrically, it is that good of a song on McCarthyism, but it does include the historically important response of Joseph Welsch at the Army-McCarthy hearings (\\"have you left no sense of decency\\").  I mentioned this song to the kids in my classes, none knew what I was talking about. Another song I do not like is \\"Strange\\" which I find very annoying.  Only the quirky guitar solo is worth listening to.   <br /> <br />Listening to Document now, however, there is much on here that makes it more solid than I remembered.  The tracks I've always liked are still great: the rocker \\"Finest Worksong\\" still kicks, \\"The One I Love\\" is still one of my favorite R.E.M. singles despite it only having one verse repeated over and over, and the beautiful vocals in \\"Welcome to the Occupation\\" still make it one of my favorites.  \\"Fireplace\\" and \\"Disturbance at the Heron House\\" are other tracks I've always liked as well as the beautiful slow track \\"King of Birds.\\"  I've gained a new appreciation for the unique and quirky \\"Lightnin' Hopkins\\" and the dark \\"Oddfellows Local 151.\\"  I've never been crazy about the single \\"The End of the World As We Know It (And I Feel Fine)\\" but it is a classic.  I still do not regard Document as one of R.E.M.'s better albums, but it sounds better now than it did to me a few years ago.It is certainly better than Green.

B0000524E5|1.0|From the hit-making producer Jerry Bruckheimer (Armageddon) comes Coyote Ugly. Moving to New York to pursue her dream of becoming a famous songwriter, Violet Sanford (Perabo) finds herself desperate and broke. Through a twist of fate, the shy, innocent Violet lands a job as one of the barmaids at the hottest nightclub in town - Coyote Ugly. The \\"Coyotes\\" spend more time on top of the bar than behind it, tantalizing the standing-room-only crowd with their antics! <br /> <br />When this film came out it promised to be an intoxicating, sexy comedy starring an unbeatable cast of hot, new stars including Piper Perabo (Rocky And Bullwinkle) and Maria Bello (Payback), not to mention Tyra Banks. <br /> <br />I have to admit, I wanted to see this picture. While it seemed to be superficial at best, it seemed to offer somewhat of a guilty pleasure, the same kind that Cruel Intentions offered. Nevertheless, the promises fell short, real short. The moviegoing audience wound up with a movie comprised of very few, if any, memorable images, cliche upon cliche, and no redeeming entertaining value whatsoever. <br /> <br />The script was doctored many many times, and not one iota of depth or meaning was present in any snippet of dialogue. The characters were hollow, the story was absurd, and the climax was ridiculous. They tried to make the DVD worthwhile by packing it, but nothing could save this picture.
B000002UVZ|4.0|It is difficult not to give this album a perfect 5-star grade.  First, it's R.E.M. during their heyday just after my favorite of their albums Fables of the Reconstruction.  Second, R.E.M. really demonstrates they can rock on this record with the first two tracks \\"Begin the Begin\\" and \\"These Days.\\"  The latter is one of my all-time favorite R.E.M. tracks and my favorite of their rockers.  Third, it offers my all-time favorite R.E.M. song \\"Cuyahoga.\\"  It is beautiful yet powerful with uplifting guitar riffs and wonderful lyrics that (for the most part) can be understood.  Pageant is just not quite as solid as their earlier releases.   <br /> <br />\\"Just a Touch\\" is one of the few pre-Document tracks I have to skip.  Michael Stipe's wailing vocals are a bit much.  \\"Underneath the Bunker\\" is a filler; a Latin style drum/guitar instrumental with distorted vocals at the end.  It is a very short track.  I also do not care much for \\"Hyena.\\"  It is an upbeat number but does not have the charm of other R.E.M. songs plus parts of it are rather annoying.  On the upside, though, the rest of the album is very nice.  \\"I Believe\\" is an upbeat, fun rocker.  \\"Fall On Me\\" is the most well-known track on this album.  It is not one of my favorite singles.  I don't know why.  It is certainly a beautiful song but perhaps it is just too perfect with the clich'd backing vocal style and lyrics; almost insipid.  R.E.M. is best when they are not perfect and a little raw around the edges.  \\"What If We Give It Away\\" is one of my favorites.  It is a pleasant song with excellent backing vocals at the bridge.  \\"Swan Swan H\\" is also a beautiful slow number.  Save for three tracks, Lifes Rich Pageant almost reaches perfection, but not quite.
B0002OERI0|5.0|uuuhh i don't know if MusicalGenius guy is being serious or funny.  PLEASE tell me that you're joking about Green Day being \\"British Jerks\\".  I thought everyone knew that they were from my hometown of Berkley, California, US of A. <br /> oh yea and this album is incredible
B00025ETIW|5.0|My Chemical Romance is just so unique and talented and for the people who said they aren't good could just go screw themself because if they don't like My Chemical Romance,then they just don't know what good stuff is these days. MCR has it all...talent,powerful music,awesome lyrics,incredible songs. This CD and their 1st one,I Brought You My Love,You Brought Me Your Bullets are just totally amazing CDs and MCR is one of the best bands of all time.
B000002LFU|3.0|Green is my least favorite 1980s R.E.M. album.  It reminds me of the later release Out of Time.  There are flashes of brilliance and then a lot of ordinary, popsy songs that lack the unique sophisticated simplicity of earlier R.E.M. releases.  It is more in-your-face pop with tracks like \\"Get Up\\" and \\"Pop Song 69\\" that veer so far away from what made R.E.M. such a great band.  At least their big commercial success Automatic For the People had substance.  A lot of these songs just seem like pop for pop's sake.    There are two reasons why I've kept my copy of this album, neither of which is the cheesy single \\"Stand.\\"  The first reason is the other superior single \\"Orange Crush.\\" It reminds me of \\"The One I Love\\" in that it seems to just have one verse repeated over and over but is, musically, a very powerful sounding track that really kicks.   The other reason is the beautiful \\"World Leader Pretend.\\"  Musically and lyrically it is one of the best tracks R.E.M. ever made.  The simple piano sound really makes the song.  R.E.M. often made the simplest things sound so amazing, and they do it again here.  \\"Turn You Inside Out\\" is an upbeat rocker.  I like the use of the organ/keyboard on that track and it has a very catchy bass beat.  The sombre \\"I Remember California\\" reminds me of Document's \\"Oddfellows Local 151.\\"  The rest of the album is not up to the high standards set by R.E.M.
B00080ZG10|3.0|THE AVIATOR is a biopic on the life of Howard Hughes. The movie gives a short glimpse into the bizarre, interesting, and uncanny life of Hughes by examining a short portion of his life. The film begins with a naked young Hughes being given a sponge bath by his mother. His mother tells him about different diseases and quizzes the boy on how to spell quarantine.<br /><br />The film then fast forward's about 15 years to the desert set of HELL'S ANGELS. Hughes is making a WWI movie that will end up being one of the most expensive movies ever made (at the time it was the most expensive film ever made; factor in the rate of inflation, HELL'S ANGELS would have cost well over $300,000,000 to make today). Hughes' parents have both died and he now is the sole owner of his father's oil drill bit company. The film briefly examines a 17 year span in Hughes life from the making of HELL'S ANGELS in 1930 until the flight of the Spruce Goose in 1947. Hughes' womanizing (especially his relationship with Katherine Hepburn), his passion for aviation, his idiosyncrasies and obsessive compulsiveness, his fight with Pan Am, and his testimony before Congress are all explored.<br /><br />THE AVIATOR has all the elements of a great movie. Martin Scorsese and crew perfectly captured the glitz, glamour, and glare that was Hollywood in the 1930s and early 1940s. Everything from automobiles to tie tacks have been recreated in detail. Few historical or biopic films have ever captured the essence of a place and time as well as THE AVIATOR does.<br /><br />The acting in the film is superb. Leonardo DiCaprio chose a great follow up to his work in CATCH ME IF YOU CAN and GANGS OF NEW YORK. He does a brilliant job of capturing all the minute and not-so-minute nuances that were a part of Hughes' character. Just as impressive is Cate Blanchett's performance of Katharine Hepburn. This is Blanchett's finest role (in my opinion even surpassing her performance in ELIZABETH) and she should garner an Oscar nomination. The supporting cast is just as fine: everyone from Jude Law playing Errol Flynn to Kate Beckinsale as Eva Gardner to the wonderful John C. Reilly as Noah Dietrich, Hughes' money man.<br /><br />The segment of Hughes' life that is shown is done well, highlighting not only the good (breaking aviation records) but the bad as well (Hughes' mental breakdowns and obsessive compulsive behaviors). A fine balance is struck portraying a very bright, yet confused American figure. I also liked the fact that the movie didn't end in typical Hollywood fashion with Hughes’ victorious flight of the Spruce Goose. The movie builds up to this climatic point that feels so much like a typical Hollywood feel-good ending. But Scorsese delivers this time and continues the action and gives a much more realistic end to the film.<br /><br />With everything it has going for it one would think that THE AVIATOR is a great movie. It should be a great movie. But for some reason it's not. Perhaps the great components were just too volatile to mix together because instead of a great movie worth watching again and again, THE AVIATOR is a film best watched once or twice and that's about it. The film delivers no message and neither is it all that entertaining. The costumes and people are pretty to look at and all the men watch the film wishing they could fly planes as cool looking as the ones Hughes did. But other than that, that's about it. Cate Blanchette is worth watching, but since Hepburn's relationship with Hughes was so short, the energy she brings to the screen quickly departs. DiCaprio does a wonderful job of acting, but Hughes is such a tortured (in spirit and mind) individual that the audience is often left only feeling pity for the man and a desire that someone would come and get Hughes some medicine so he would act normal and do more exciting things. At face value it would seem that THE AVIATOR is a movie that should soar above the clouds. Instead it turns out to be a film thatis best left grounded even on a cloudless day.is best left grounded even on a cloudless day.
B00063MBU8|5.0|This is a very good pop-rock CD for teens and preteens who just wanna have fun!  I found myself enjoying every minute of this album.    Shut Up-4/5- This is a fun song to rock out to.  I don't think that it's the best song lyrically, but the tune is awesome.  It's a pretty cool song.     Welcome To My Life-4/5- This was a pretty good song before the radio took over.  Don't get me wrong- it's still awesome, but sometimes I skip it.     Perfect World-5/5- This is a really good song, one of my favorites.  Pierre's vocals are pretty good in this song and I love the chorus- it rocks!    Thank You-4/5- This song is pretty good, except for the fact that it's very short.  I love the chorus and the verses, the bridge is OK.    Me Against The World-5/5- This has become one of my favorite songs over time.  It kind of reminds me of a Good Charlotte song...hmm....!!!    Crazy-5/5- This is one of my favorite songs on the CD.  The lyrics and tune just click.  It's very creative and catchy.    Jump-4/5- This song is good musically, but lyrically it's kind of weak.  There's something about this song I don't like.  I can't put my finger on it, but other than that, it's ok.    Everytime-5/5- This is another favorite song on the CD.  The tune and words, like with Crazy, correspond very well and the vocals are very good.  It's a sweet song.    Promise-5/5- This is my favorite song on the CD.  I instantly loved it after my first listen.  It's cute, it's catchy, and the guitar totally rocks.    One-4.5/5- This is basically an anthem of independance.  It's a really good song.  I love the verses- the lyrics are amazing.  This song has some of the best lyrics on the album.    Untitled-4/5- I've come to like this song, but I'm not sure why it's a single.  The guitar in the middle stands out the most.
B00005OCMR|1.0|I like geek movies, but this is one bad film.  I had forgotten just how awful it is.  Essentially an 80s video game that lasts 96 minutes and offers minimal entertainment.  (In fact, there was an arcade game based on the movie -- also a dud.)  Impressive special effects for the time, but silly plot and dry acting.  Almost bad enough to be a cult classic... but not quite. <br /> <br />Disney as its nadir. <br /> <br />Your time would be better spent in the retro section of an arcade.

B00062J00S|5.0|\\"It's A Wonderful Life\\" is a timeless classic and will always be one of my favorite movies. I must say that I was surprised with the DVD. I had very low expectations for it. I was excited to see that they had audio in French and Spanish - most movies only have subtitles. I have listened in the movie in Spanish and was also grateful to hear that it was a very accurate translation of the lines in English. <br />If you love \\"It's A Wonderful Life\\", go out and buy this great DVD.
B000069CWE|5.0|Seriously Reanimation is a great cd and in my opinion its just as awesome as Hybrid Theory.  Any person that loves LP will really like this cd. <br />I cant really say anymore, Im sure you wont be disappointed with Reanimation.

B0002Z0EYK|5.0|People are 100% wrong when they assume Troy was based on Homer's Iliad.  In fact, both Troy and the Iliad are based on the wealth of historical and mythological material surrounding the Trojan war.  But where the Iliad takes a very tiny slice of the material (no \\"Trojan horse\\" for starters), Troy attempts to fuse all the material into one coherent whole.  And as an actor, writer, translator and classicist, I am openly envious at the way the script wove the mass of material into a gripping whole that can speak to the modern mind. <br /> <br />  Take the Briseis role in the film, for example.  Her character in the movie fuses Cassandra, Polyxena, a touch of Klytemnestra and Homer's own Briseis.  (See [...] for more background.)   <br /> <br />For people suffering from the \\"Troy as warmed-over Iliad\\" illusion, Achilles's death in the film is an aberration.  But if you don't know the Iliad -- or if you happen to know the whole of the Trojan history/mythology -- Achilles's death scene in the film is a stroke of genius.  In the Achilles/Polyxena thread of the Troy tradition, Achilles is killed treacherously by two of Priam's sons as he is trying to negotiate peace because of his love for one of Priam's daughters.  The script combines that thread with Homer (and others) to produce a compelling dramatic moment.  (And let's face it, Homer's version of A's death translated directly to film couldn't help but look a bit silly.) <br /> <br />I think the negative attitude toward Troy is paradoxically a result of the anti-intellectual fervor that has the U.S. by the throat these many years.  The more we despise our cultural heritage, the more we wield it like a pickaxe to undermine any artist who attempts to create something relevant out of the past.  In my imagination the movie Troy was beaten to death by a gaggle of furies wielding Cliff Notes. <br /> <br />In a world where tripe like \\"Independence Day\\" (1996) and a bloated knock-off pastiche like \\"Kill Bill I/II\\" get any starsat all, something as well-crafted as Troy deserves attention.  So, five stars for the brilliant script (INFINITELY better than  \\"Gladiator\\" by the way), and for the attempt to bring a critical piece of our collective heritage to modern consciousness. <br /> <br />Highlights:  1.  The one-on-one battle scenes in Troy are the first Homeric battles to make any sense of Homer's descriptions.  Never before has Hollywood had so much knowledge of martial arts or so many actors in good shape. 2.  Brad Pitt's Achilles is exciting and believable because of his (digitally-enhanced???) speed. <br /> <br />Advice:  see the movie (on DVD now) -- I almost missed the movie in the theatre because of the incompetent criticism that accompanied its debut.
0790729652|3.0|Tim Burton's \\"Batman\\" redefined what a comic-book movie should look like. To this day, Burton's vision is shared (or imitated) by almost all directors of superhero adaptations - vengence, darkness, and grimness are the norm. Burton did it better than most, because the Batman character lends itself very well to a brooding atmosphere. Michael Keaton and Jack Nicholson sounded miscast as the Batman and Joker prior to the film's opening; afterwards, they are remembered by many of us as *the* definitive portrayals. This is an unforgetable film for those of us who saw it in 1989.<br /><br />That said, where are the extras on this DVD? It's a shame that the redundant and unoriginal action blockbuster playing at your local theater this weekend will be guaranteed a better DVD release than Tim Burton's \\"Batman.\\" There's plenty that Warners could have included here - outtakes, auditions, interviews, original promotional materials, even trailers. Hopefully, this DVD will be reissued in the upcoming months with some goodies. Until then, despite its brilliance, I'm going to have to recommend this bare-bones release as a rental, not a purchase.
B000002BBY|5.0|This album was so freakin great!  The brother's Gallagher were at the top of their game when this came out.  As arrogant as they were, I think that they deserved all the kudos they got.  They had all the parts of the british invasion rolled into one...The Who's guitars...Led Zeppelin's sex appeal...The Beatles Melodies...The Kink's sibling rivalry...The Stone Roses arrogance.  If I could give this album more than 5 stars I would.
B0002KVUKM|3.0|Although supposedly inspired by the Universal monster movies of the 1930s, \\"Van Helsing\\" has far more in common with both the anime film \\"Vampire Hunter D\\" and the Mel Brooks spoof \\"Young Frankenstein.\\" Like the mysterious D, Van Helsing fights the supernatural while wearing a fedora and crop duster better suited to a spaghetti western, and much like \\"Young Frankenstein,\\" many of the scenes and virtually all the dialogue is laughable. I'm one of the few who thinks this was intentional; there were a lot of laughs in Universal's \\"Mummy\\" remakes, and it's possible that Universal was once again trying to interject comic relief into a feature film overburdened with special effects and an underwritten script.     Hugh Jackman, in his first leading role (he previously costarred in the X-men movies, among others), appears mainly bored or lost as the title character. He finds himself surrounded by oversized werewolves, harpy-like \\"Brides of Dracula,\\" the always lovely Kate Beckingsdale, a Shrek-like Mr. Hyde, and a seemingly endless series of exaggerated, cartoon-like stunts. There's some good stuff in here; the werewolves are better done than in the recent Harry Potter film, and with their faux Eastern European accents, the Brides of Dracula could probably carry their own comedy-horror film ala \\"Love at First Bite.\\" But so much razzle-dazzle is constantly thrown at us that it's hard to truly enjoy much of this. Supposedly Van Helsing is employed by the Vatican to fight evil; I kept wondering why they didn't just hire the Ghostbusters instead. After all, the Ghostbusters were genuinely funny and memorable, unlike Van Helsing.    This biggest problem with this film (and its DVD) is that Universal proved they learned almost nothing from their 1940s horror films. Those films got sillier as the decade went on, but despite shrinking budgets attempted to compensate with good acting, clever makeup, and intriguing situations. \\"Van Helsing\\" has one-note performances, unbelievable caricatures, and a numbing succession of CGI scenarios.    The DVD includes a handful of extras. While scarce, they are well done, and move my rating of the DVD up from two stars to three. But \\"Van Helsing\\" is likely to go the way of other, easily forgotten \\"high concept\\" films. If you must have this, I'd seek out a used copy.

0553062182|4.0|I read this book a couple years ago. I am generally not into pop psychology, self-help books, etc...So it was unusual that I picked up this book at all. But the description of the book sounded so much like me that I had to read it.     While I don't agree with some of the advice in the book...What I liked best about this book was simply that it was a positive pep talk for people who have HSP traits. There are good and beneficial things about our traits! I have gone through life feeling ostrasized by others because I am quiet natured and introverted. \\"You're too quiet.\\"  \\"You're too serious.\\" \\"You're anti-social.\\" ...On and on it goes.     People on the opposite side of the spectrum (light-hearted, talkative people...) are not criticized like this - I am not saying they are never criticized, but not nearly as much as we are. Our Western culture simply does not value our traits.    If nothing else, this book was simply an encouragement to me. I am not alone, others have traits like me, and although there are downfalls (which we can learn to deal with)- there are many positive aspects to being a quiet and introspective person.     I think HSP has some similarities to the the melancholy temperament type. The ancient Greeks identified 4 basic temperament types. (For an interesting book on the temperament types, read \\"Why You Act the Way You Do\\" by Tim Lahaye. It is from a Christian perspective just so you are aware. And it's not a \\"scholarly\\" book either, but just an \\"easy-reading\\" book about temperament types.)

B000002MP2|5.0|This is one of the most (like most green day albums) amazing albums to ever hit the shelves. <br /> <br />1. Burnout - Great intro, it really shows who green day is with their pot smoking, what not. 5/5 <br /> <br />2. Having A Blast - Even better than burnout, its about a hostile person whos about to kill everyone in his path because someone put him through all this bullsh*t. 5/5 <br /> <br />3. Chump - This is about Billie's ex-girlfriend's new boyfriend, and he never even met the guy. this song leads right into longview. 4/5 <br /> <br />4. Longview - Great Bassline, possibly the greatest song on the album, its about bordem and masturbation...meh, typical green day song i guess you could say. 5/5 <br /> <br />5. Welcome To Paradise - (also appears on kerplunk) its about a boy who left home to go live his own way with his own environment (with thugs, criminals, etc.) and he doesnt mind it one bit. Then Mike does this great solo, really awesome song. 5/5 <br /> <br />6. Pulling Teeth - This song is actually about mike and his ex-wife (anastasia) had a pillow fight and mike accidentally broke both his arms, billie and mike laughed all the way to the hospital, then billie decided to write a song about spousal abuse. real funny too. 5/5 <br /> <br />7. Basket Case - one of the best songs of the 90's. 10/5 <br /> <br />8. She - See Basket Case. 5/5 <br /> <br />9. Sassafras Roots - Repetitive, but good. 5/5 <br /> <br />10. When I Come Around - Sophisticated Green Day, i guess you could say. good bass. 5/5 <br /> <br />11. Coming Clean - Nothing Special, but still, its green day so it has to be good. 3/5 <br /> <br />12. Emenius Sleepus - Mike Wrote This one, its real funny. 5/5 <br /> <br />13. In The End - Fast and short, i love these songs, even though my cd skips at this point. 5/5 <br /> <br />14. F.O.D. - Great song to finish off the ablbum, just billie on the acoustic then BAM typical green day. <br /> <br />Secret Track - All By Myself - Listen to it, and you'll get it. <br /> <br />So I recomend to buy this album before theyre all gone.
B0000CD5I6|5.0|I'm compelled to clarify something after reading some of the reviews for this CD. Ian Anderson being the formidable musician that he is, never limited himself to expressing his musical soul through one musical style. That's why the great \\"classic\\" Tull albums like \\"Aqualung\\" which some consider his magnum opus was never just a 'rock' album and contained many tunes which did not include any \\"heavy\\" guitar, for example, listen to the masterpieces like \\"Cheap Day Return\\", \\"Mothergoose\\", Wondering Aloud\\", and \\"Slipstream\\". The preceding album \\"Benefit\\" had wonderful acoustic style tunes like \\"Inside\\" and \\"For Michael Collins...\\", or go back further to \\"Stand Up\\" to hear excellent compositions unembellished with \\"rock guitar\\" like \\"Jeffrey Goes To Leicester\\", Fat Man\\", and \\"Reasons For Waiting\\" not to mention \\"Bouree\\"! Do I have to go back to \\"This Was\\"?!  <br /> <br />As a fan of Jethro Tull since 1970 I never ever made a differentiation on Tull albums with reference to song style. To me it was all \\"Tull\\". (BTW- Guitar fans also do not have to be concerned with the absense of or lack of emphasis of the guitar on this 'Christmas' CD because there's p-l-e-n-t-y of it right up there in the mix!) So called fans who feel they have to hear heavy overdriven guitar tracks in a Tull song in order to consider the song somehow \\"worthy\\" aren't really Tull fans after all.  <br /> <br />Even if you are one of these pseudo Tull fans, if you could refrain from comparing The Jethro Tull Christmas Album to your rock guitar Tull favorites, you might be able to hear the exceptional quality of the music here which makes this release certainly one of the very best Christmas CD musical experiences. I believe that if most Tull inclined people compared this recording to their favorite Christmas album, they'd realize it ranks up there with it. It's inspired with a deep appreciation of the magic of the Christmas season and achieves an expression of musical sensibilities that captures and portraysthe warmth and joy of that human miracle we call The Christmas Spirit. <br /> <br /> Thanks again Ian. This dog's been fed!
B0000399WI|5.0|The best movie in every movie store. There can be no other movie that reaches the heights of this one. Its a true classic. For me its the measuring stick. I compare all other movies to this one. I give Godfather I and II a score of 9/10. 10 being shawshank. I simply cannot accept another movie that can be like the Shawshank. not possible.......Everyone who watches this is forced to give it 5 stars. Guys like me get a little carried away and 5 seems to short a number for stars if the movie is shawshank. I just get goose bumps everytime i hear morgan freeman delivering those wonderful dialogues. Man what a movie!
B00005N91B|4.0|Your impression of this cult classic is probably bang on target, no pun intended. It's lurid. It's paced like a highway truck. With decent twists. Even grotesque ones. And it's embellished with grisly slasher scenes inspired by \\"Psycho\\", or perhaps De Palma's lacklustre \\"Dressed to Kill\\" if you include a certain elevator murder.<br /><br />You could accord several labels to its unabashed whodunnit moments wrapped in soft porn, but complexity would not be one of them. The plot isn't exactly a brain-twister, Hitchcock nailed this effectively in \\"Suspicion\\", about someone unwittingly getting entangled with a virulent maniac.<br /><br />It's the screenplay that scintillates. Smart and sexy, a little manipulative and very interchangeable, but it fashions itself for the purpose of its existence. Ultimately, it's less ham-handed than it is nonchalant about being such a disposable perk. The finale is admittedly a bit contrived but it works in that strange little way.<br /><br />Stone needs no introduction but my second viewing confirms that Michael Douglas pitches in a lot of 'hard' work too. Not sure if it's the indelible rear shots of him, or the ultimate range he proves in what could have easily been a third-tier erotic thriller.<br /><br />Fascinating rental for above eighteens.
B00008OLYN|5.0|I agree to one reviewer about the growling Opeth. I mean if there are so many growling bands around, why not stick to the sweet melodic sound that you've got and mark your music with an edge that stands out amongst all? <br />Every time opeth growls, it pisses me off, not because the music is bad - no way - but it really sucks to listen to michael just corrupting his great great voice for nothing. Anyways, im no longer a growl fan ( i was when in teens ) but now what strikes me about this band is its immaculate poetry and the music style. I havent seen many bands, except Anathema, that reach this level of writing in their songs. Opeth, while keeping the music melancholic, manifest a great variety within every single track in terms of flow. Opeth is simply fantastic and thats true for all their albums (doesnt really matter if they're growling), thier lyrics are absolutely beautiful.  <br />Damnation is an outstanding album demonstrating how great a band this is with some of the rarest and finest pieces of writings. My Arms Your Hearse is the best example of how good they can write and produce. If Opeth experiments another album like Damnation, skips the growling part and leave it to other heavy bands and focuses more on good writing and matching music delivering, theres no telling how good it can get.  <br />Even if they keep on the way they are, theres always a number in their album where michael sings with his true voice and no growls. <br />The change and maturity in their albums can really be thought of as the case of Anamthema. Alternative 4 was a great change in their music. Damnation is a wonderful change for Opeth. While I still dont mind the post-damnation Opeth, I really would love Opeth to take their music somewhere from Damnation. <br />By and far, Opeth is truly a 5 star band no matter what the sort of album they release. If the musc is not so good, its overcome by the lyrics, if the lyrics are a bit weak, the melancholic rock is always awesome.
B00005IC2H|5.0|To be clear, I haven't heard every track on the CD.  I have only heard two: Svefn-G-Englar and Staralfur.  I got the tracks available to me for legal download off the internet, because I had just seen The Life Aquatic, and Staralfur is used in the climax, which I was greatly moved by. <br /> <br />I listened to Staralfur on my computer, and within twenty seconds I was crying.  I have trouble listening to the track without automatically breaking into tears. <br /> <br />If the other tracks were silence, the pure, overwhelming beauty of Staralfur would be enough to pay $15 for.  Fans of orchestral, fans of new age, or fans of the epic rock tradition of Pink Floyd and company should be greatly affected by Sigur Ros.  Highly reccomended, and I am going to get this as soon as possible.
0812550706|5.0|I picked up this book initially because the guy I like told me it was his favorite. But once I started reading, I was immediately hooked (and that's saying a lot coming from someone who normally highly dislikes science fiction). Great story, believable characters... this book is now up on my favorites list.
B0000C6E4D|5.0|Upon a first listening, this album seemed consistent, but unextraordinary - good lyrics and tunes, but nothing that rocked my world. Having left it in my car stereo for months on end now without tiring of it, I've to come to the conclusion that it must be damned well-crafted. I can sing the lyrics to every song without having had to concentrate, or I can let the music fade into the background without it disrupting me at all. That's a rare album. <br /> <br />On a more technical level, it's very similar to Sarah's previous studio album \\"Surfacing,\\" but is generally more melancholy with fewer songs with radio-play appeal. I actually prefer that because it seems more personal to the artist and less as if she was producing for the masses; granted, that as well means the masses may like it less. <br /> <br />A must for Sarah fans and highly recommended for those pensive, introspectic and slightly lamentable moods when you want someone to commisserate instead of cheering you up. But if it's pep, sass or fluff you're after, this isn't the right album for you.
B00000AF98|4.0|Much in the same way as Judas Priest tried to update their sound around the same time with Turbo, and indeed most other (even then) veteran acts such as Heart and Ozzy Osbourne were glossing up and popping up their sound, KISS attempted the same thing here with \\"Crazy Nights\\". And it is strange because the production is woeful with the tinsy sound provided by Ron Nevison, and the material is at times awful, but for me this is the one eighties era KISS album I can state I still love. To my ears Gene wrote a couple of class tracks here in \\"Hell or High Water\\" and the mature stylings of \\"Good Girl Gone Bad\\" which were head and shoulders above anything since the last make-up album no question. Paul's stuff is fun pop with \\"Turn On The Night\\" and \\"Reason to Live\\" and the title track \\"Crazy Nights\\" although ultimately the later becomes somewhat annoying after several listens. Along with the production there are somethings to really dislike here namely the wart on the record of \\"No,No,No\\" next to \\"Boomerang\\" the worst KISS song ever, and Paul singing other tunes at a pitch that can become like nails on a blackboard. Poor Bruce twiddles away like a man possessed when the songs are simple and would benefit from guitar work that was the same. So by no means perfect and as a result not a huge seller in the USA, \\"Crazy Nights\\" was a nice diversion and a brave attempt to change with the times whilst staying fairly close to the KISS blue print. Some saw it as desperate, but I liked it then and still do now.
B000002GB6|5.0|This is definitely my favorite albums and the first jazz album I got inspire and influenced in jazz. Chuck Mangione was the first jazz endeavor I ever experienced when I was a child. I actually love his playing and love how he sounds. He does his men playing along with him Grant Geissman, Charles Meeks, James Bradley Jr. and Chris Vadala. they all sound great knahmmean. <br /> <br />I luv every song that he did on this album and this is definitely going into the Jazz Hall of Fame or the Top List of Jazz Albums. <br /> <br />I recommend the following albums: <br /> <br />1. Miles Davis- Kind of Blue <br /> <br />2. Maynard Ferguson- Conquistador <br /> <br />3. Herb Alpert- Rise <br /> <br />4. Freddie Hubbard- The Best of Freddie Hubbard, First Light, Above & Beyond, Hub-Tones, Straight Life, Life Flight, etc. <br /> <br />5. Chet Baker- The Best Thing for You/You Can't Go Home Again <br /> <br />6. Grover Washington, Jr.- Winelight, Come Morning, Mister Magic, The Best of Grover Washington, Jr. <br /> <br />7. Marvin Gaye- The Best of Marvin Gaye (Motown Anthology Series) <br /> <br />8. Miles Davis- Live Around the World, Tutu, Doo-Bop, Aura, The Man with the Horn, Bitches Brew, etc. <br /> <br />9. Marvin Gaye- Dream of a Lifetime, Romantically Yours, Vulnerable (3 great final releases from the legendary Marvin Gaye) <br /> <br />10. Barry White- All-Time Greatest Hits, The Ultimate Collection, Can't Get Enough, The Icon is Love, The Man is Back, etc. <br /> <br />Just to name a few list I can recommend to this album. He sounds a bit like Miles Davis, Freddie Hubbard, Chet Baker, Donald Byrd, Art Farmer whom I listen to the most.
B00064AM6C|4.0|Imagine the lyrical brilliance and melodic sensibilities of Lennon/McCarthy, the molten riffs of Jimmy Page and Tony Iomi, the soul and passion of Robert Johnson, and the force and energy of the Ramones, all in one band. The White Stipes is all this and more. They're quite simply the best \\"real\\" rock and roll band performing today. In a world of prepackaged, computer generated garbage that gets past off as \\"music\\", the White Stripes are proudly carrying the torch. <br /> <br />The chemistry between Jack and Meg is amazing. I've never seen a band this much in synch since Led Zeppelin with John Bohnam. They literally can finish each other's sentences (musically speaking). <br /> <br />If you've only heard the White Stripes on radio or CD, then get this DVD. The true measure of a band is whether or not they can cut it live. The White Stripes could easily wipe the floor with any other live act performing today. <br /> <br /> <br />
B0002X314C|5.0|I received this CD as a birthday gift and have been immensely impressed with his lyrical ability and phrasing and musical imagery depicted from his work. This CD is so spiritual and enlightening. Although Mr. Legend deals with the old so familiar musical themes (family, infidelity, family and romance) that all musical listeners have heard before, it is interesting to hear his own intepretation of those themes. Like I Use to Love You. How many times have we heard how a man cannot afford an expensive female, but through his analysis and introspection he realizes that he does not love her like he thought. What about Alright? How many time have we heard men singing about watching or checking out a female who has tickled his fancy. Remember Slave's \\"Watching You\\". I can go on and on. I do feel that the comparisons to Curtis Mayfield or Donny Hathaway are premature, but I believe that people are making comparison just as when Alicia Keys first appeared. People were comparing her musical talents to Stevie Wonder. The reason that these artist are even compared to these other artist because these artist such as Donny Hathaway, Stevie Wonder,Marvin Gaye and others are standards of excellence. Definitely, Legend one day will be in the same category as these people since the upcoming generations will definitely be using him and Alicia Keys as a standard for musical excellence. This is an awesome CD for any listener. It is so beautiful for John Legend to get it right by making meaningful lyrics and still place a splash of hip-hop and spirtualism which he got from the church. I really have no favorites since I think the musical sequencing of the CD is perfect. Props to John Legend and may he always maintain true to himself. Tracks that are immaculate are Stay with You, She Don't Have to Know (Clever Cheating Song), of course \\"Ordinary People\\", It Don't Have to Change (Nostalgia of Sam Cooke's \\"A Change is Gonna Come\\", and Live It Up. Finally an artist that is true. Thank you Mr.Legend.....The name adds up to the Legend.....
0684857219|5.0|This is the book to start and end your bodybuilding career. If you notice the guys today really don't look very good. Arnold really had the body look, Especially the arms in my opinion. This book has his own opinions which I think are nice.
B00004TH7Z|5.0|I don't know what some of these reviewers are smoking, but I think their judgment has been so clouded by the \\"bands\\" that call themselves metal these days that they don't remember what actual metal is.  Some of the songs on this CD are good, and the rest are freakin' awesome.  Blood Brothers is about Dickinson and his deceased father, and it's an incredibly cool song.  Out of the Silent Planet is one of my favorite songs EVER, and that song and Fallen Angel both sound like they could have come from an older Maiden album (for those of you bitching about the fact that this CD sounds different).  I don't know where this idea of Dickinson losing his voice came from, but it sounds just as good as it ever did to me.  I HIGHLY suggest any Maiden or metal fan (that's real metal, mind you, not the crap they play today) get this CD immediately.  An excellent comeback.  I just hope Judas Priest's Angel of Retribution will be this good, thereby reviving two of the best bands ever who never had any business splitting up in the first place!  GET THIS CD!
B00028HBKM|2.0|I heard many testimonials from people that this movie changed their lives. Atheists, Christians, Jewish people alike- they loved it. As a person who isn't religious (but also not atheist), I had no preconceived reason to love or hate this movie. I went in with an open mind, hoping it would be as powerful as I had been told it was.     It wasn't.     The majority of this movie can be summed up in 2 sentences: Jesus bleeds (a lot.) His mother and Mary Magdeline follow him around, with apalled looks on their faces, crying. This may seem a harsh, blunt summary, but trust me, it isn't an exaggeration.     I'm having a hard time figuring out why this movie converted so many people. I can't imagine how the violence in this movie would even seem significant to a person who didn't know the story behind the man being put to a slow death (the movie certainly doesn't tell this story.) And if the viewer did know the story of Jesus... why hadn't they been converted BEFORE seeing the movie? A man's lifetime of tolerance, unconditional love, and self-sacrifice isn't enough to convert a person to Christianity, but a couple of hours watching brutal torture can do the trick? If that's the case, these people are joining the church for the wrong reasons.  I've been told, \\"well you have to read the Bible to get the full story.\\"  I don't think that this movie should be any exception to the general rule that if you have to read the book to fully understand the movie, then it's not a good movie.    I gave this movie 2 stars, and they're both for the cast. The acting in this film was superb, but as a whole it was disappointingly hollow.
0345440900|4.0|I really liked the Babywhisperer before my son was born, and started him on EASY (eat, activity, sleep, you) from the get go.  This worked very well for us in the beginning.  Sleep collapsed at about week 6--and despite my instincts, I did not pursue the doctors.  We ended up with a reflux diagnosis at 6 months.  EASY probably saved us to some degree, because he was not eating and then going right to sleep--reflux babies are supposed to be upright about 20 minutes after eating.  <br /> <br />Once we had his tummy sorted out, we had a week of the bad habits he learned through the reflux.  Then we switched to Weissbluth.  The great thing was 5 minutes of crying, and he was back to being the simple to put down baby he had been at the beginning.  I am convinced that the foundation we laid on the EASY method has created the great (touch wood) sleeping situation we have today!  <br /> <br />I did not read this book to be rigid in scheduling--we were on a EASY with no time line schedule for a long time.  Also, I find the website to be an awesome resource.  Tons of moms who will post schedules, answer questions and give advice.  There you can even see that Tracy did have \\"flex\\" in her routines, and how to make it work so you can get that babt ti start off knowing how to sleep on his own, instead of having to learn it later.
B00006690G|5.0|Just buy the album, cause even if you don't like it (if you don't then there's definitely something wrong with you) Emimen is going to be a legend someday and anything that has anything to do with him is going to be worth millions of dollars.
B0002OERI0|5.0|I buy this album when it come out on the first day. But i didnt catch my attention until now. I list the second singles . Now i listen to this album everyday and i cant get enough of it. Green Day really doing someting different and this is their masterpiece..  <br /> <br />Highly recommend to everyone that love rock music <br /> <br />Best song: Wake Me Up When September Ends,Boulevard Of Broken Dream,Are We The Waiting . Of course the 9m song also.. actually is every song...
B000002IU9|3.0|To all those who rate manowar albums such as this one, pretending to sound intelligent by using \\"typical power chord structure\\" and cheesy meaningless lyrics, and most humorously \\"how can anyone take this seriously\\" as an INSULT are simply missing the point of what amkes manowar awesome.  Manowar is awesome because it is cheesy, loud, repetive and HILARIOUS.  Furthermore those who complain that each album is exactly the same as the last, should realize that this simply means you don't need to buy every album(unless you're a die-hard, and if you were you wouldn't be complaining about manowars repetitiveness, as you would realize that it's part of their act!).  Rather you can buy any five(or less) albums in any order and laugh your ass off for every listen. If you want more go ahead and buy more of this amazing junk, I know you won't complain. I myself am not a big manowar fan, and haven't actually bought any of their albums but I have listened to them and i laugh proudly every time. Triumph of Steel does the manowar legend proud(as do all of them).Hell it's worth it just for the album cover. So for fans of anything campy, or simply those who bang their heads in the most supremely manly way that is known to metal, buy this record or any other manowar record. PS for those fools who like to bash amazon reviewers for their grammar and spelling, i realize my grammar sucks and i have enough of a life, as to not be caught up with the perfectness of my amazon reviews.) <br /> <br />HIGHLY RECOMENDED.
B0006A9FKA|5.0|\\"Just a tip for other males out there: if you make your girlfriend watch this with you, she will not be impressed and be prepared to be made to watch The Notebook in return. :)\\" <br /> <br />IGNORE THIS RUBBISH. <br /> <br />Women who have amazing taste and aren't morons will love this movie for it's subversive humor, gore, and all-around fun feel. It's a delightful romp through the cliches of typical zombie-film horror and takes parodying to a hilarious level. You'll love it, and it's a great movie for couples to watch. Skip The Notebook, and stock up on this, along with other great zombie flicks!
B0001IN0DA|5.0|WrestleMania XXI should be great and I will give some of my match predictions. <br /> <br />Sunday Night Heat Match: <br /> <br />Eugene & William Regal vs. La Resistance for the World Tag Team Championships.  This will be a 9:00 match and I figure it would probably show La Resistance winning the tag titles.  It ends when Slyvain Grenier pinned Regal after the Au Revoir. <br />Winners=La Resistance at around 9:00. <br /> <br />WrestleMania XXI: <br /> <br />Funaki vs. Spike Dudley for the Cruiserweight Championship.  It will be around the 11:00 minute mark.  I'm predicting that Funaki retains with his finisher the Rising Sun(Tornado DDT). <br />Winner=Funaki at around 11:00. <br /> <br />John Cena vs. Carlito Caribbean Cool & Jesus in a Handicap Match.  Before this match Cena chased Jesus around until he left the building.  This match will last about 7:00 minutes.  Carlito didn't stand a chance.  Cena wins with an FU on Carlito. <br />Winner=John Cena at around 7:00. <br /> <br />Trish Stratus vs. Lita vs. Victoria for the Women's Title.  This match didn't even happen because Lita & Victoria beat Trish like a mule backstage and this match never happended and Trish retained. <br /> <br />Basham Brothers vs. RVD & Rey Mysterio vs. Luther Reigns & Mark Jindrak for the WWE Tag Team Championhips.  This match ends around the 18:00 minute mark.  Reigns & Jindrak win when Reigns hit a Swinging Neckbreaker on Danny Basham.   <br />Winners=Luther Reigns & Mark Jindrak at around 18:00. <br /> <br />Chris Benoit vs. Chris Jericho.  There match on Jan.17 that was supposed to be a friendly competition went wrong went Benoit turned on Y2J.  That left them at WrestleMania.  It ends when Benoit goes for the Crossface but Jericho reverses and rolls him up for the 3. <br />Winner=Chris Jericho at around 23:00. <br /> <br />JBL vs. Eddie Guerrero for the WWE Championship.  This match will be around 16:00 minutes long.  Great match, when Eddie goes for the Frog Splash JBL gets the beltand hits Eddie with the belt and covers him, but Eddie kicked out then JBL hit a Clothesline From Hell for the 3. <br />Wiiner=JBL around 16:00. <br /> <br />Undertaker vs. Heidenreich in a Street Fight.  This match was made when Heidenreich buried Taker but he came back at took out Heidenreich.  This match will be about 20:00 minutes long.  During the match Heyman came to the ring and hit....Heidenreich!?!? with a chair then Heidenreich walked into a Tombstone Piledriver on to a garbage can. <br />Winner=Undertaker around 20:00. <br /> <br />Shawn Michaels vs. Edge in a Special Guest Referee Match w/ The Rock.  The reason The Rock is the ref is because HBK said that Edge and him have to have somebody to make sure things don't get out of hand.  The match itself goes about 35:00 minutes.  It has a confusing ending.  Edge grabs a chair and swings at HBK but The Rock gives Edge a Rock Bottom.  HBK covers 1,2,.... The Rock pulls HBK off and gives him a Rock Bottom then Edge covers HBK for the win. <br />Winner=Edge at around 35:00. <br /> <br />Booker T vs. Kurt Angle.  This was a true battle of endurance.  This match should go 30:00+.  It ends when Booker hits an Axe Kick followed by a Book End. <br />Winner=Booker T around 30:00. <br /> <br />Triple H vs. Randy Orton vs. Batista for the World Heavyweight Championship.  This match is about 45:00 minutes long and every superstar spills blood.  It finally ends when Batista hits a Sit-Down Powerbomb on HHH to win the title. <br />Winner=Batista around 45:00. <br /> <br />This could be the card.
B000059TEQ|5.0|This is the greatest romantic film of all time, by a wide margin. This movie hits the heart like a cupid's arrow. Somehow, this movie makes you feel like YOU are living through the love of your life, and it will last only an hour and a half. You sense this from the very beginning and you begin to relish every second of its undeniable charm and power as like you are enjoying a virtuoso concert. This movie was released around the time I was born and I regret every year which I didn't see it.  Never have I been more captivated by the characters and their chemistry. Their dialogues are both authentic and hilarious. There is not a single misplaced sentence which suffocates the flow of the film. Instead, the witty charms of the characters makes them irresistible. In effect, the audience falls in love with the characters, and wishes the story will never end, despite its obvious ending. Put this together with outstanding acting and unforgettable music, and you have a film that hits the heart like no other. The film feels like a passionate love relationship which you know will not last.
B000002MP2|5.0|WTF to that guy who gave this GOOD cd 2 stars...are you really that dumb? From what i see, you just come here to review a pop punk band and give the albums a 2 or 1. INFACT YOU NEVER LIKED THIS KIND OF MUSIC!!  <br /> <br />do not listen to that guy... he's an Anti-Punkster. Green Day is a GOOD band ,buy this cd, all the other reviewers got the words out of my mouth...GREAT CD! TAKE MY WORDS BUY IT! or buy American Idiot. Both good choices.
B0002IVN9W|3.0|I suspect that, like many who picked up the CD, it was done based on rave reviews elsewhere. However, after giving a couple of listens to this CD, I have to admit being mildly disappointed. I was expecting tremendous things, but &quot;Funeral&quot; did not deliver. Perhaps it is the victim of heightened expectations; I don't know. Still, there are some excellent moments on this CD; however, they do not add up to a classic - certainly not one that ranked very high on critics' polls. The lead singer has both an off-putting and intriguing singing voice. It reminds me a bit of Roger Waters of Pink Floyd. For a debut album, this is very good. The talent is there, and I expect great(er) things from Arcade Fire. For now, I would easily give the nod to fellow Montrealers Stars &quot;Set Yourself on Fire&quot;, which is the better of the two CDs.
B00000634J|4.0|this is a pretty good review of john lennon's solo recording career. although if they were to take off \\"Mother\\" and put on \\"Remember\\" i would be much more satisfied. Plus maybe take replace \\"Borrowed Time\\" with \\"Isolation\\". butts, its pretty good. I listen to it quite a bit.
B000002UJQ|5.0|This isnt exactly the type of album you will fully appreciate on a 1st listening.I lent my friend the Bends and she loved it at first but her review was that this album was S*** after listening to it once.Admittedly,i found it ok when i first got it but it truly grew on me.The lyrics of songs like let down and exit music require a bit of thought(and even then you dont know if youve interpreted them right)but if you do grasp it,the album is full of emotion at all levels. <br />Its a much different sound to previous Radiohead albums and alot less elctronica then everything after,finds its place right in the middle. <br />After about 3 propper listens,you will never want to get rid of this one,i assure you
B00003CXV4|5.0|No one can act like Keanu Reeves.  His face is full of expression and he's always convincing in his work.  Actors like Anthony Hopkins only dream of having the amount of talent Keanu has.  In Sweet November, he was so honest and real as Nelson.  His radiant performance distracts us from Charlize Theron's awful acting.  Keanu rocks!
B00006RINF|5.0|Comalies is one of the best albums I had heard during 2004. I played it on repeat, learning the lyrics and melodies by heart. Cristina, has a beautiful voice that captures so many emotions and the songs are so lush and captivating. It is probably one of the most unique CDs I have ever heard. <br /> <br />The best tracks on here have to Heaven's A Lie, Daylight Dancer, Ghost Hunter and The Woman and Unspoken. The lyrics are deeply complex and the music is deeply beautiful. But overall, this album is nothing short of astonishing. <br /> <br />As far as Evanescence comparisons, not necessary, because Lacuna Coil is better.
0064407667|2.0|I have a hard time understanding how this book is so popular.  The idea is ok and starts off kinda cute, but it lacks any real substance.  I kept waiting for some great twist or turn and nothing happened.  Then I thought, well maybe there will be some huge climax, and again I was wrong.  The part where he explains what certain words mean seems like we are idiots.  If he wants kids to understand it, then use different words.  I also didn't like talk of marriage to his niece.  Thats not something I would want my son to read.  I'm not sure if I'll read book 2 or not.  Hopefully the movie is better.  Jim Carey is such a goofball, he can make anything good.  This author however, I'm not to sure about.  The Harry Potter series in SO much better.   <br /> <br />
B0001ZMWQO|5.0|This album is so quirky and so out there. I have heard nothing like it before. Part of it is just so rock-n-roll. I really love the singer's vocals, so smooth and so off-beat. The songs all have different themes, ranging from dancing at a gay bar to being on BBC2. This is an album that is fully deserving of the hype.
0451191153|2.0|The Fountainhead is so poorly written that it really can not be evaluated using standard criteria: in fact, in her introduction, Ayn Rand complains about naturalistic fiction - that is, fiction with plausible plots and characters that could exist - and explains that she is trying to write about ideal characters.  Judging from what she has written, in her ideal world, people would be thin, entrepreneurial, and selfish.     Some people are of the opinion that this book is a page turner, and it is true that Rand can be compelling in a bombastic, apocalyptic way.  One character - Tooney, a bad guy - wants to control the world.  Another character - Wyand, who is both good and bad - also wants to control the world.  A third character - Roark, a Christ figure - just wants to put up some nice buildings but is attacked at every turn by corrupt gangsters.  They all want to sleep with Dominique Francon, a thin and beautiful (what else?) social critic.  When these supermen clash over the fate of the world, you think something pretty dramatic is going to happen.  In fact, nothing much does.  The losers drift away, diminished, and the last man standing gets the girl.    As others have noted, the dialogue in the book is not believable.  Rand is nothing if not preachy, and her characters don't talk to one another, they make speeches to one another.  Because of its defects as fiction, The Fountainhead can only stand as a book of ideas, and even Rand's ideas are not presented very attractively.  In the New American Library edition, there are 15 pages of end material that apparently were included to try to present her philosophy in a more persuasive fashion than she does in the novel.  Rand is an atheist and sees no reason for people to sacrifice themselves for the sake of others: in fact, selfishness is good, since each individual human life is an end in itself.   Most people have at least some libertarian leanings and so will find some superficial appeal in her ideas.  But there isnothing of lasting value here.  Who can believe that there is no higher purpose or meaning in life than pleasing oneself?
0393035158|4.0|In the past month, roughly 150,000 people were suddenly, tragically, horribly, and undeservedly slaughtered in minutes.  I see only three possibilities: <br />1.  God intentionally killed them. <br />2.  God didn't bother to save them. <br />3.  God couldn't save them. <br /> <br />In light of such horror, Mr. Harris' book is of urgent concern.  While the last chapters, discussing \\"spirituality\\" as a neurologic function lack depth and coherence, the first several chapters, with their unflinching examination of dogmatic irrationality, should be of interest to anyone concerned with critical thinking.  I urge that this book be read in memory of the 150,000+ dead. <br />Iowa City, IA
0553213105|5.0|Jane Austen's stories have endured for years, and this one is probably her most famous work.  It is a story about an empty-headed mother and her search for proper husbands for her five daughters.  The book is a prime example of the manners and morals of the gentry in a small English village in the early nineteenth century.  Ms. Austen does such a good job of displaying these strictures and morals in her novels, that to us in the present day it appears to be an entirely repressive era (which it actually was).  The plot and the characterizations in this book are wonderful as in all Ms. Austen's works, and it tells a dazzling story.  It is a charming and wonderfully warm tale that I never tire of reading.
0446530891|3.0|The main characters were interesting & well-developed.  The focus on Secret Service agents on presidential candidate protection details is a nice touch.  However, the plot is too complicated & implausible, and there are too many vaguely-defined peripheral characters to make this book a hands down winner.<br /><br />I read quite a bit, and I had a hard time following the plot in this one.  Even in the final pages, where the villian explains his entire scheme & motive, things didn't become clear, or the least bit convincing.<br /><br />this isn't one to put down & pick up again later -- it's too easy to forget where you are & which of the many peripheral characters are involved.  It would be a decent fast-paced read best consumed in a single setting, with one's full attention.
0688156819|5.0|One day, as I travelled through my dreary life along with all the other gloom filled robots of the world, whose souls have been sucked out by the mindless antics of television, authority, or perhaps even by themselves unknowingly, I waited anxciously for the fourth period bell to ring. Ah, that ring, it may only be a five second ring sounding as if a cat were being run over  repeatedly, but it meant the world to me. It meant . . . freedom . . . freedom from a life of being chained helplessly to the hard, cold, wooden desk of my so-called &quot;education&quot;. The bell rang, and I decided I would travel over to my friends house for a quick snack, or perhaps a quick escape from my harsh reality, it didn't matter which one. Anyway, I was in her room, as she frantically searched for her phone through the mountains of clothing that lay on her gray, dead floor, I noticed a book on the dresser, all black with maroon in the center where the words &quot;Melancholy death of the oyster boy&quot; were written. I picked it up, took a glance, was about to toss it aside, when i noticed the strange yet alluring cartoon on the front, assuming it was this so-called &quot;oyster boy&quot;. Intrigued, I opened it, page after page of ingenious poetry, with clever characters to go along with this truly amazing writing. It was diturbed, dark, black, dead, cold, souless . . . I loved it. I immediatly went to amazon.com to find this truly glorious book, I ordered it, and a few short days later it arrived on my door step, no it wasn't the book, well, atleast it wasn't just the book. For that book represented my life, and it's meaning, my life was dark, black, disturbed, all the things this book seemed to be. It told me that there were others as dark as I was. I had truly found my life's meaning. I would recommend this book more than any other, I would also recommend the holiday edition of this book! rock on Tim Burton! We were meant for each other Tim! I love you!
B0006IJ5PM|3.0|Based on a true story, but told and shown with a bit of over-the-top melodrama, this film may have the makings of a cult classic high school flick, but I think its semi tragic ending will preclude that from happening.  Nearly a soap opera in some aspects, there is still plenty of \\"high-light\\" film footage that gives the film a dramatic flair, but unlike a film, like say, Miracle, this one won't have you smiling at the end wanting to see it again.<br /><br />The acting is mostly good, and the realism of the undue and sometimes cruel pressure put on high school aged boys comes across very well, and if the film has a redeeming message it is simply not to accept the behavior presented, to not glorify the actions taken by the participants; be they parents, players, coaches or members of the community reliving the past vicariously through local high school football players.<br /><br />I suppose this realism and drama actually  make this film a better work of art than if it was a feel good movie just about winning, I just don't know if that  sells as well.  That, I suppose, is the rub, it's a good movie precisely because of the message it gets across, but it's not as fun as the type of movie people watch for escapism, the kind I'd normally recommend owning to watch again and again.<br /><br />In any case, I do recommend it as a decent movie, at least to see once, and it certainly reminded me that, yes, high school really sucked.
0060987464|5.0|I'm going to keep this short.  First of all, everyone \\"inside\\" the music biz knows Manson, Brian Warner, is an \\"act\\".  He tried for years to get his conventional rock band signed to a major label, with no success.  He adopted the satanic persona to get a record deal.   <br /> <br />His \\"stage philosophy\\" is a teenager's poor understanding of the works of Frederick Nietzsche. <br /> <br />Nietzsche, however confused he was, did not approve of using drugs or drunkeness, and I don't think he would approve of Manson.  During his lifetime Nietzsche wrote how amused he was that so many people whose philosophy he did not approve of, never-the-less thought they found approval for themselves or their cause in his writings.   <br /> <br />The real value of this book is that it may help parents struggling with an ODD child/teen to understand what is going on.  What you will learn is that it is usually, though not always, the parents fault for ODD (not a chemical imbalance), and ODD in children and teens is based in rank parental hypocrisy, expecially when the hypocrisy is tied in with shallow religion. <br /> <br />When parents mess up their kids in this way, you give them over to the dark side.   <br /> <br />This book should be required reading for all people who have children in this toxic Western culture.  Should make a wonderful baby shower gift. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
0156027321|5.0|The Life of Pi. Its easily read story. Even though its an easy read, it makes you think. Actually feeling somewhat surprised near the end.  I have asked myself since reading the book, what did happen? Any book you ask questions about once you have finished reading, is a successful book. Its origianl, and ceative. It actually made me feel as if I was reading a gruesome fairy tale. There is a hugh morale message behing this book. Its not a morale message of right or wrong, but who and what humanity is, and what society requires of us. Everyone I have talked to comes up with their analogy. Personally, I think it comes down to, are we what people want to be, or are you a person who is an individual. So do you reveal to the world what it wants to see or believe, or are you truly honest with yourself and others? Its  a story about a boy, who is shipwrecked, and finds himself stranded with animals from a zoo. Its survival, and life. Its the struggle for life. Its the best non-fiction book written this year.
B00004RFFS|5.0|This film is the best vampire movie EVER! It's beautifully acted, with a nothing short of brilliant performance from the young Kirsten Dunst and a surprisingly un-wooden Brad Pitt!<br /><br />'Interview With The Vampire' is the story of a vampire called Louis (Brad Pitt) who is finding eternity somewhat wearing. He decides to tell his story to a young reporter (Christian Slater)-the whole story. Of how he came to be. He is visited by a charismatic vampire called Lestat De Lioncourt (a very handsome Tom Cruise), who gives him the gift, or bane, of immortality, but at a price - he must drink blood. Louis cannot stand killing innocents, and instead feeds off rats.. until he takes a young child called Claudia (Kirsten Dunst) in a moment of grief after watching Lestat torture a young woman. Lestat procedes to make a vampire out of her, and together they live as a happy family. Until the day that Claudia realizes she will never grow up and becomes extremely angry. Over the course of the story, they also encounter an actor vampire Santiago (Stephen Rea) and his 'leader' Armand (Antonio Banderas) and their legendary 'Theatre des Vampires'.<br /><br />The story is flawless, as the screenplay is written by none other than Anne Rice herself, so it's very close to the book, unlike it's successor, 'Queen Of The Damned'. It is a brilliant film, and I urge you to watch it, even if you aren't into all things vampire.
0140277447|5.0|A Japanese reviewer had justified the Nanking massacre by referring the Chinese massacre of the Tibetans. A strange way of justifying indeed. Thus the Jewish treatment of the Palestinians also justify their prior (worse!) treatment by the Nazis? At any rate, while I abhor the massacre of the Tibetans which occurred during the cultural revolution, the Red Guards massacred many people of different ethnicity, including a large majority of Chinese themselves. It wasn't as racially motivated as the Nanking massacre. <br /> <br />A good point to note that most Japanese who denied the truth of the Nanking massacre are Shinto believers. Most Buddhist Japanese are able to come to terms with this horrendous deed of their forefathers, and have participated prominently annually in commemorative events. <br /> <br />Shinto believers have this problem because the root lies in the fact that the religion preaches the infallibility of the Japanese race and particularly of the imperial family. A believer would certainly be unable to accept that their own people could commit such atrocious crime, and would strenuously, furiously deny it. <br /> <br />Indeed it is this very belief in their infallability that led them progressively into aggressive behaviour towards their neighbours, whom they view as racially impure and inferior. In this aspect this is very similar to Nazism, only more muted, and sadly, more enduring. <br /> <br />Incidentally, Nanking was by no means the only massacre though it was the largest by the Japanese. In Singapore and Malaysia, tens of thousands of Chinese men were murdered during the nearly 4 years of Japanese occupation. These men were rounded up and brought in trucks to remote locations, forced to dig trenches and then gunned down by the Japanese soldiers, who then buried them in these very trenches. Numerous such places have been recovered. My parents personally know of people whom have been rounded-up and disappeared, and also of survivors who made it totell the truth. My university room-mate's family still do not buy Japanese goods because his maternal grandmother lost all her sons this way. But the British did not pursue the Japanese for compensation they way they did with the Germans since we're just colonies, and the succeeding governments needed Japanese investments so did not see fit to offend. It is now dim memory for most of the young people, but it does not mean that the massacres did not occur. <br /> <br />
0783233477|2.0|Hopkins and Pitt are great...in fact, their chemistry merits a better movie altogether.  The original was/is beautiful...this updated version is convoluted, misdirected, overlong and lost in some Yuppie-Vigalante premise.  Yuk!<br /><br />Everything is overdone...the editing, the production design, the (groan!) dialogue, direction and even the hairstyles.  Poor Continuity couldn't keep up with Brad's ever changing bleached bangs.<br /><br />Love the casting and the costumes...every suit is fabulous.  Everything else...blecch.  The most memorable moment (which should tell you A LOT) is Hopkins  being led off to the hereafter with the witticism, \\"Don't blow smoke up my as*...it will ruin my autopsy.\\"  Egad!

B0002Z0EYK|3.0|I admit that I didn't expect much when I started watching Troy. I read several negative reviews and I almost decided not to watch the movie, but I'm glad I did. Troy is a reasonably entertaining sword-and-sandals type of popcorn muncher. As long as you don't expect Homer you won't be too disappointed. There's precious little poetry here and the gods are referred to but are otherwise absent. <br /> <br />First, the cast. The always outstanding Brian Cox steals every scene he is in as Agamemnon. Cox is one of the most talented character actors working today and he has enormous screen presence. Eric Bana is fine as the tragic hero Hector and Orlando Bloom is suitably callow and cowardly as Paris. Sean Bean, another of my favorites, is good although underutilized as Odysseus. Peter O'Toole as Priam gets to deliver the single best line in the movie, during his scene with Achilles.  Rose Byrne as Briseis is by far the best actress in the film and her relationship with Achilles is by far the most interesting male-female relationship in the movie. I hope to see more of her. <br /> <br />These fine performances highlight the most important flaw in this film, the casting of Achilles and Helen. Simply put, Brad Pitt is not a good actor. He is hopelessly miscast as Achilles. Never is he believable. His dialogue is delivered in a wooden monotone, his accent is all over the place and rather than rage, his primary emotion is pique. His battle scenes aren't too bad but they are overchoreographed and don't seem very believable. This poor casting choice is what seperates this film from better movies of this genre such as Gladiator. <br /> <br />Almost as bad is Diane Kruger's Helen. She's attractive enough but no more so than many other actresses. She completely lacks charisma and virtually disappears from every scene she's in. Her face couldn't launch a single ship, much less a thousand. She should take lessons in screen presence from Brian Cox. It takes more than a nice figure (something Cox would be the first to admit he lacks).  <br /> <br />The large battle scenes are well done and exciting and the costumes and scenery are also well handled. I enjoyed the sight of the ships sailing for Troy and the CGI was pretty seamless. I appreciated the fact that Helen's adultery was an excuse, rather than a reason for the war. The reason was Agamemnon's imperial ambition, well presented by Cox. <br /> <br />So, all in all not a bad film but a better job of casting would have made it much better. A missed opportunity but not a bad way to spend a couple of hours, as long as you're not expecting Homer.
B0001ADB8C|5.0|This box set takes its place along with the collection of vinyl, CDs and tapes of Harrison's work. I absolutely love this collection, but I am displeased that the Bonus dvd is now being sold separately. I feel that is not fair to have originally marketed it as a bonus and increased the price of this collection. Still, this is worth having and inveterate Harrison fans will not be disappointed.<br /><br />The dvd is worth it. This marketing ploy nearly cost this one star. Just the same, get the collection.

0140067477|5.0|This book became popular not only because of Pooh or Tao, but because of the explaination of the \\"3 Vinegar Tasters\\" scroll painting in the book.  Before this book became popular this famous painting was unknown, and because of this book, people know what it is.      (...)     That is the painting described in the book and as you can clearly see, one of the good points of this book was explaining the three main philosophies of Taoism, Confucianism, and Buddhism in China.    I recommend that readers visit the site that details the relationship between Taoism and the other philosophies and see how Tao of Pooh fits Taoism in there.

0380789035|5.0|Like some twisted offspring of William S. Burroughs and Tom Robbins, Neil Gaiman takes the dark soul of america and lays it under the microscope. Our national fears are examined with the dispassionate care of a mortician sifting through the debris of a tragic accident. Echoes of Jim Thompson and G.K. Chesterton follow these spiritual grifters and wounded innocents down the highways and byways, past the roadside attractions all the way to the center of america. A dark yearning for a vanished purity that was only ever achieved by washing in the blood of innocents, and whose stain can only be covered with more sacrifice forms the animating principle of this powerful work.<br /><br />Yes, our forefathers were genocidal (...), what of it, do you think that because you are rich and comfortable that you can escape the guilt as well? This book is the crawling worm-track of the american soul, if you want to understand this countries darkest nightmares and pettiest fears, read this book.
B000002J09|1.0|Okay I have to admit I used to like rock music quite a bit-. The Stones, , The Kinks, Beatles, The Who, Queen, Sabbath, even a bit of Motorhead now and then to kick out the jams. But I never liked Zeppelin. I tried...and tried...and tried. They're  amped up blues rock and folk. Big deal. Hardly worthy of all the praise of \\"greatest music of the 20th century\\" and all the usual  Zep hype.And it always annoyed me that people would hurl insults at me for not liking them. So I don't like you're favourite band? Big 'effin deal!  Why chastise me so obnoxiously for that? And recently I've been expanding my listening habits, and been amazed at the wealth of great music out there, that really shows Led Zeppelin as the paper thin band that they are.  Not an ounce of originality between them. I think the final straw was some guy on this site who said -and I quote- \\" last two reviewers should BURN IN HELL for disrespect to Zep!!!\\" or the advice given by one reviewer that people who don't respect Led Zep should kill themselves. I don't have time of that kind of nonsense anymore. Led heads are on a  par with Moonies (and I'm not talking about Keith Moon) Most music discussion is fairly subjective , but at least with other music it can go beyond the obsequious \\"Bow down before the Gods Of Rock!\\" tripe associated with Led Zeppelin.If I never hear another note by horrible Led Zeppelin it will be too soon.
B0006FFRW0|3.0|To clarify to all the techy people, in 1994 nobody recorded at 24 bit. 24 bit converters had been invented but Pro-Tools and Sound Designer II (which the Downward Spiral was sequenced on) where both only 16 bit. There is 99% chance it was 16 bit. Now Trent Reznor likes to record to tape before using the computer to sequence his sounds. So this is actually what you are hearing: analog transfered to 16 bit 44.1khz, mixed down to analog again, then transfered to 24 bit 48khz. Why 24/48? It doesn't make much sense to me. Anyway, I'm surprised that there is any improvement on the high res formats. The advantage the SACD disk has is that it captures the sound of the analog equipment used in the mix, while the DVD-A cannot. <br /> <br />My opinion having listened to both SACD and Dual Disc is that SACD sounds better, but has less dynamics because the mastering engineer used too much dynamic compression (it flattens out the dynamics). I haven't heard both in 5.1, but I would guess the Dual Disc would sound better because my experience has been that although I prefer SACD, DVD-Audio 5.1 mixes sound alot clearer and more dynamic.
B000002IOY|4.0|my introduction to a band that would become one of my favorites .i can't say its the best over kill album,but i can safely say its in the top 3.\\"years of decay\\" saved the band from certain death after 88s flop \\"under the influence\\".an album that would'nt have been half bad if the producers had'nt been under the influence.this is the last album w/bobby gustafson & in my opinion his best work .
B00066N8JS|4.0|I'm a little disapointed with this disk. Although the sound quality on SACD is great, Trent's surround mixes are very interesting, and the extra disk has some cool stuff, TDS reissue suffers from a MAJOR problem. That is overcompression.  <br /> <br />Compression is an electronic technique used in the recording process that flattens out volume or dynamics. It brings quiet parts up and loud parts down. All pop CDs use it and you can hear it taken to the extreme in radio where the volume NEVER changes a smigeon regardless of the song. Well anyhow I feel that Bob Ludwig's remaster is a step closer to radio. The sounds on this album seem pinched and constrained and the mix lacks any  <br />dynamics. One of the best things about the Downward Spiral was the contrasting textures of sounds. On this they all stay at the exact same narrow band of volume throught the entire album. <br /> <br />The bonus disc seems to have been spared. Since it wasn't deemed as less important it looks like there was less pressure (major labels want 'radio ready' songs)to crush the sound. It actually sounds alot better.  <br /> <br />But my gripping aside this SACD sound FAAAAAR better than the Dual Disc DVD-A. The 24/48khz DVD-A sounds like a regular CD in comparison.  <br /> <br />This is a good disc, but if not for Bob Ludwig's mastering compressors it could have been a great one.
B000002KIE|5.0|Much as I hate the term 'punk', that is essentially what this is. Don't buy into the Clash or the Ramones, this is the original punk rock band. Don't get me wrong, the Clash and Ramones, etc., are good, but this tops them all. It's one of the most played CD's I own. I'd reccomend this to the aspiring punk any day.
0385510454|1.0|I read this and kept thinking with every page turn that something was about to happen, but you know what?  It never does.  The book had a lot of potential but wasted it.  Grisham spends at least 200 pages describing Italian lessons.  Can't he come up with something better than that?  With the descriptions of all the countries out to get Joel and the methods they use, I thought someone would try, but no...  There is no hidden plot, no someone that you're trying to guess which team they're on, no surprises, not much of anything.  A big disappointment.
B00005ASHM|5.0|Okay, so everybody and their brother-in-law says this album is the greatest. Well I don't know, who can say, but this album definitely has no weak songs, the mark of a truly great album. Think of every great album you love. There's probably one or two not so great songs. Revolver has the inconsequential fluff of 'and your bird can sing' and 'dr. robert'; not John's best by far. Rubber Soul has 'run for your life', a song written just to fill out the album and, 'wait', another inconsequential song. There's no meaning behind these album on the whole. People always say that Sgt. Pepper is this great concept album but even Lennon said, the songs have nothing to do with each other except that they are opened and closed by the title song. If they really wanted to go with the concept idea or that of a live show, they could have made it a little more evident. Even Sgt. Pepper's is weak because of songs like 'lovely rita' and 'fixing a hole'. They're great songs, but what to do they really mean for the album as a whole? <br /> <br />This is where Pet Sounds succeeds. To me, the album is a very clear concept and story: boy meets girl, (wouldn't it be nice) boy leaves girl and goes to the city to make it big, (that's not me) boy meets new girl who was hurt by a guy like him, (i'm waiting for the day) but he wins her over, (let's go away for awhile) boy loses girl, (here today) becomes disillusioned with the life and the business, (sloop john b) and longs for his home, for the person he used to be, (i just wasn't made for these times), realizes what a great girl he left behind (god only knows) and returns home (pet sounds) and finds the girl he used to know is bitter at him (caroline, no) and things have changed. <br /> <br />All along the way, flawless, beautiful music that tells a real story with sincerity and meaning. Something few albums have ever achieved.
B000002UR7|4.0|\\"Creep\\" (esp. the clean version - the 'f-ing' seems juvenile), \\"Thinking about you\\", \\"I can't\\", \\"Prove yourself\\", \\"Lurgee\\", and \\"Blow out\\" are all classics that anyone who likes Radiohead will want to play *a lot*.   <br /> <br />This record is known as a minor Radiohead record (because it is!), but if it had been made by anyone other than Radiohead, it would be regarded as one of the best records of the early 90's (seriously, how many records released in the 90's have more than 6 great songs on them?).  The same thing happens in other media:  _The Killing_ is regarded as a minor Kubrick (because it is!), but if someone other than Kubrick had made it, it would be recognized as one of the two or three best noirs.
B0006213WG|4.0|so i grabbed a copy of sum 41's new cd and its actually pretty good. i like it. however the only thing thats kinda buggin me is that when everyone says that they ripped off metallica in 'bitter end' and i think they're right! i mean, master of puppets...and battery it sounds so similar. anyway besides that its an awesome album, i dunno why alot of bands get crap for 'going serious' just like blink182 got crap for their new album back in the day...but its just a way for the band to expand their musical horizons, and they expanded in the right direction.
0671027344|3.0|This is the toughest review that I have ever written. This book has many perks that make it a good bathtub read (really, it can be easily finished under 4 hours) but at the same time there is a certain something missing that makes this book incomplete. The characters are interesting even though shallow to a certain degree. But in a weird way they are realisticaly shallow, meaning that like every other human being on this planet, they have moments where they think and act in an stupid manner without any meaningful way. Charlie sometimes shines with brilliance in his letters but at other times doesn't even think twice, for example when he tries LSD he doesn't say how he felt about it to begin with. Charlie is confused an naive. I have personally identified with that part of him because I myself spent my high school years confused and naive. What this book does is show one way to grow up. It shows that our lives are made complex by others and external events but most of all by ourselves. One thing that does not add up is that the protagonist is apparently a genius although his writing is sub-par. It is dry and missing the color that I would expect the writing of a freshman genius would be like. The story has been told many times and this author definitly has potential but he is missing something... maybe the story is missing a feeling that Charlie is alive. The writing style makes him too two-dimentional, the events are told marvelously and even though Charlie expresses his feelings they are missing a certain something, a certain desire, that human being generaly display.
B000002UAU|5.0|If your a novice Beatles fan and you just want to see what all the fuss(well deserved fuss!)is about you should try the 67-70 cds for the later music 62-66 for the earlier classics.But if you want to go straight to the albums for the later music nothing really encapsulates the essence of later Beatles as well as Sgt Pepper.A pure psychadelic blast and some say the best album ever.Definately the pinnacle of psychadelic rock along with Floyds Piper At The Gates Of Dawn.60's music(or music in general)doesn't come any better then this and rarely or perhaps never as good.Hendrix was overblown,Wilson lacked variety and had only a few great songs in him,but the Beatles had it all.
B000002UA2|4.0|Wedged between Meddle and Dark Side Of The Moon lies the almost-forgotten Obscured By Clouds.  Because this was the Floyd's second outing as composers for a Barbet Schroeder film and not an actual Pink Floyd-intended project, Obscured By Clouds can't really be considered the true follow-up to Meddle.  However, despite its \\"soundtrack status\\", it is a vital chunk of the Pink Floyd catalog.   <br /> <br />The entire album was written and recorded in a two week blitz at the Chateau d'Herouville just outside of Paris.  This time around (the recording of More being the first), the band insisted that director Schroeder's influence (interference?) over the sessions be severely limited.  This gave them a full two weeks of freedom to treat the state-of-the-art 16 track studio as their own musical laboratory.  The results are surprisingly good for such a short amount of time. <br /> <br />A mood is immediately established with the combination of Obscured By Clouds and When You're In, two mesmerizing instrumentals that start things off.  The former is heavily synth driven (embellished nicely with Gilmour's trademark slide guitar), while the second (almost an Obscured By Clouds Part II) is propelled more by power chords and Mason's drums.  Burning Bridges is a ballad immersed in the beautiful vocal exchanges and harmonies of Dave and Rick and contrasts nicely with The Gold It's In The..., an uptempo rocker that shows the band just having fun.  Wot's...Uh The Deal follows, complete with Dave's angelic vocal harmonies and a sensitive piano solo by Rick.  Mudmen (one of the highpoints of the album) is an instrumental once again spotlighting both Wright and Gilmour.  Rick's languid keyboards paint a dreamy backdrop before Mason's drums usher in Dave's Floating fuzz-toned guitar.  The keyboards and guitar intermingle in a glorious fashion, further cementing the dream-like feel.  This is followed by Childhood's End, a Gilmour composition, which is arguably the best song on the album.It has a driving rhythm, great vocals, and of course a load of tasty stinging guitar licks.  Free Four is next, an upbeat stomp-along song, boasting lyrics that hint at subjects Waters would obsess over in years to come.  Unfortunately, though some of the lyrics ARE quite good, they are rendered slightly impotent by the song's bouncy, jovial atmosphere.  After a somewhat disjointed Gilmour guitar solo fades out, Stay (another album highlight) starts up.  This gorgeous ballad, with a wonderful lilting chorus, is a great showcase for Wright's piano and vocal talents.  It also contains some magnificent wah wah guitar by Gilmour, who all but steals the show.  With nothing but a toned down Stratocaster and a crybaby, he manipulates the pedal in conjunction with bends and vibrato to give his guitar an extremely expressive, vocal-like quality.  Finally, the album closes with Absolutely Curtains, a predominantly synthesizer-based composition colored slightly with percussion.  It has a calming but dramatic feel to it, and ends the album quite nicely (though somewhat strangely, as a New Guinea tribal sing-along fades in as the actual song fades out).   <br /> <br />Obscured By Clouds may not contain any powerfully sublime moments, but it's floating stark beauty - a harbinger of things to come - is certainly worth the price.  Don't let the fact that this is a soundtrack to a dated French film hold you back.  Each song is a well-crafted and terrifically executed piece of music capable of standing on its own.  Fans of Meddle, Dark Side Of The Moon, and Wish You Were Here will especially love it.  This is truly a fantastic album.
B000001DTM|5.0|It can be easy to forget now that the world changed in the early 1990s--and not just the sort of change that marks the passing of one cultural era and the rise of another. An Evil Empire fell; political maps became quaint historical relics in the space of days; technology replaced politics as the stuff of which revolutions were made. <br /> <br />The Zeitgeist lived large and moved quick during those years. And with Achtung Baby, U2 managed to capture that spirit and put it to work, song by song. When I think of that time in my life, I think of this album. When I hear songs like \\"One\\" or \\"Zoo Station,\\" images of Berlin come to mind--the Berlin I saw in 1991, a single geographical body with two wildly incongruous personalities, ecstatic confusion mixed with terrifying disorientation. When you hear Achtung, Baby for the first time, does it leave you disoriented for a moment, wondering how such a band with such a familiar sound had wandered so far into such completely unfamiliar territory? Good. <br /> <br />Many bands try, but U2 succeeded: They captured the Zeitgeist, trapped the lightning in a bottle, condensed the sound of a world gone mad--wonderfully, beautifully mad--into Just A Bunch Of Pop Songs. <br /> <br />You want Rock 'n Roll? Go buy a Who album. You want the type of art that surfaces a handful of times every generation, if you're lucky? Go buy this album.
B00005YW4H|4.0|What a wonderful original artist with a beautiful voice. It is very rare to find a CD where one likes the majorityof the songs.

0060594888|5.0|Paragraph separation.Would you rather spend a year as an apprentice to Donald Trump, or as an apprentice to a tenured professor of marketing who has never worked in private industry in his entire life?  If your answer is the latter, you've flunked.Just prior to college graduation, long, long ago, my accounting prof made a very profound statement to his class.  \\"After you walk up on that stage and get your degree, take it home, put it in a box, and go to work.\\"It worked out for me:  a long career as a business book writer--55 titles, 1,100,000 total sales--and now, restlessness having gotten the better of me,  I've come out of retirement to publish my first novel, just out this Christmas Day past.Canfield's can-do advice is just plain old common sense, in every way. If you think, \\"I get better looking every time I look in the mirror,\\" you can't miss.Without hesitation I rubber stamp this book.
B00005JMAH|2.0|Book 3 is my favorite book, and they made the worst movie out of it, by far. <br /> <br />I didn't like the directing style for this movie AT ALL.  It struck me as completely lazy and nonchalant.  The director seemed to choose settings for scenes based on what was easy and convenient, instead of what was exciting.  And what happened to the costumes?!  The wizard robes were all abandoned for ordinary modern clothes!  Cummon...   Did he think we wouldn't notice?  And the acting suffered.  Everyone seemed to be playing along with the \\"this is easy because we're cool, we don't have to try\\" work ethic of the director.  In the end, there was very little sense of atmosphere in this movie.   <br /> <br />And here's the worst part:  the dramatic ending (which was one of the best literary endings ever) was totally and utterly botched.  It didn't even make SENSE!  My husband, who hadn't read the book, left the theater completely confused.  He didn't even know if the plot's major character was a good-guy or a bad-guy!!!  I knew, as I watched it, that he wouldn't know, because they completely skipped over the explanation that puts all the pieces together. (What on earth were they THINKING?!) <br /> <br />If you have not read the book yet, definitely don't ruin the book for yourself by watching the movie first!  If you have read the book; well, I know you're obsessed with HP, so you have to see it, but don't say I didn't warn you.
B00005JMEW|5.0|A Abosultey spectacular movie! The best Hollywood has dished out in a long time! Yet Again Quentin Tatantino has tickled our taste buds with another of his great works!  <br /> <br />A breath taking movie..the Choreograhpy of the stunning fight scences was remarkable. The Showdown at the House of Blue Leaves was very well done. The unique style of the butchery was grotuoteous in a sadisticly pleasing manner.  <br /> <br />Uma was Sexy Stunning and perfect is the Sleek Yellow  number roaring through the throng dealing with those who stopped her aim to Kill Bill. She played the role superbly, enacting all types of scenes with focus, passion and adaptibility!  <br /> <br />O-Ren-Ishi was radiating SEX appeal with her powerful indepndent and controlling part.She rose to the role unprecedentd and played the part well. Her fight sequence was sorrowful, artful and challanging, the swtich from english to japaneese, the whispered and shouted dialouge, the fast paced attacks to the slow dance like moves left me encaptivated. <br /> <br />Vernita Green- The film with her fight scene with Uma. a Perfect start which left us wishing they had fought a little more.It was fast paced, bitchy and damn she could fight.Her butcher look with her Knife was great,She radiated sassy caty and im a bitch so stear clear look.The gun in the cornflakes bit..leaves me afraid of whenever it comes near to brekfast time! <br /> <br />The Cast were GREAT! each playing thier role fantasticly, <br /> <br />Sophie Fatalle bled sexiness in her organised and all knowing role! <br />Gogo was Crazy, menacing and disturbingly entertaining! <br />Hantori was entertaining and a superb actor!  <br /> <br />The cultural insight, the emphasis on the pride, respect and importance of the Samuri sword was great! The Theme of the Movie was interesiting and leaves me in great anticipation for Volume Two! The Music was great, varied and perfect for each scene!  <br /> <br />TO sceptics and Critics all i will say is wait for Volume Two and then decide, it needs to be viewed in Full till to you can judge it! ...am i being insane in yearning a Volume 3?! yes maybe i am..Thanks for reading hope this was helpful!
0425170349|1.0|I used to like Tom Clancy's books.  But it seems to me, and a lot of other people, that the newer stuff is just crap.   <br /> <br />Where do I start with this one?  The characters were two dimensional, they heroes were more like superheroes that could do nothing wrong.  The story if so repetitive it borders on funny.  The villian is an oxymoron, he's the president adn CEO of a corporation, yet he's a tree-hugger.  And to make it worse, he has an idea for world domination that looks more like something out of a bad James Bond movie.  Then to top it off, Clancy obviously didn't do his research when he was writing, because he seems to have forgotten that when it's summer in the US and England, it's winter in Australia. <br /> <br />Overall, the book is lacking and seems to be on the collapse of a once good writing career.  If you want to read a book written by someone who knows how to write an anti-terrorism unit book and not as long, go get OMEGA FORCE:  THE GHOSTS OF WAR.
B00014TJ7K|4.0|Harrison shines with this production produced by both Harrison and fellow Wilbury Jeff Lynn. Harrison's great friends make up this all-star band with Eric Clapton, Ringo Starr, Gary Wright (piano), Jim Kelter (drums), Jim Horn (sax), Jeff Lynn, Bobby Kok (cello), Elton John and George on guitars and keyboards. George has great vocals and sounds confident with a generally up beat sound and also free expression of his unique humor (Wreck of the Hesperus), Although the big song that reached the top of the charts was \\"Got My Mind Set on You\\", my personnel favorite songs are \\"This is Love\\" a romantic, sprightly, positive tune with great lyrics like \\"Since our problems have been our own creation, They also can be overcome\\", one of George's best; \\"Fish on the Sand\\" with great driving guitars; \\"When We Was Fab\\" a salute to his time with the Beatles with sounds reminiscent of songs from \\"Magical Mystery Tour\\" or \\"Sergeant Pepper\\"; the jamming \\"Devil's Radio; and the \\"Wreck of the Hesperus\\" demonstrating George's optimism about his time and with his unsinkable humor with lyrics like \\"I'm not the wreck of the Hesperus, Feel more like Big Bill Broonzy, Getting old as my mother, But I tell you I got some company, (But it's alright)\\". Harrison always has hidden gems on his albums/CDs, in many ways they are more pleasing or as pleasing then the headliners. Also included in this re-release are Harrison's songs \\"Shanghai Surprise\\" from the movie sound track (1986) and \\"Zig Zag\\", a short song by Lynn and Harrison. High energy, great play and confident Harrison make a great album.
0789723107|5.0|This is an excellent primer on usability (particularly websites).  Steve makes it clear from the beginning where he stands on the issue of usability: \\"Don't make me think!\\"   <br /> <br />Many users have already done an excellent job of listing the areas that he covers in the book.  I just wanted to mention that it is well written, is itself well designed, and a pretty quick read. <br /> <br />I keep coming back to the book, and my copy is really dogeared.
B00008AWOG|5.0|I read some customer reviews and listened to some samples, and still felt unsure. I had never heard this band, and was generally sick of rock/metal for years..so I got the album to give it all another chance- and it was one of the best albums I had ever heard. To me, it was great,born of a variety of stylings. It beats the [...] out of 'death metal,' (a genre I normally steer away from)and is just creative as hell. Some of the guitar work is like early Megadeth or Metallica-only on steroids. Then you also have a good bit of actual singing and harmonizing.. Pretty good voice..atmospheric and haunting sounds. Lots of acoustic guitar work -and it perfectly compliments the epic metal sections and growling vocals. Amazing they pulled all that off so well. I can't help but want to crank up the volume.
B000002VFW|5.0|I still remember my shock on seeing Lisa's picture on the CD cover of affection. You guessed it; the soulful voice fooled me too, as did many other black people. Put it this way, her sound is Visceral! So pure soul voice from such a small blue eyed woman at that.. still european, but that soul? You can't fake that, it is a gift.. I can't imagine what her voice would sound like on a 6.1 dolby digital surround! <br /> <br />Affection album is still my best and there are some truly germ pieces on the album that are not as commercial as say \\"All around the World\\". See \\"This is the Right Time\\", \\"When are you coming back\\", \\"What did I do to you\\".. Also loved the classic ballad on Real Love..  Her voice is an acquired taste and it captivates those who truly love the voice. This explains her mild success in the U.S <br /> <br />Affection was released around the time as Maria Carey's other album although I can't remember which of Maria's albums.. Maria has a voice too believe it or not in spite of the whoos and haaas but Lisa's voice is unique, almost with that ambience you can't quite describe..  <br />Affection and some of her truly captivating ballads were ahead of it's time a decade ago.. I can still isolate her voice from the beats, which speaks volumes about the acoustic quality of that voice.. Do I recommend this album? Absolutely! <br />
6305263248|5.0|I was aware of Deniro's body of work but this was the first time I was introduced to Frankenheimer's work..  Such a shame he passed away a few years back.. I was truly impressed with the realism of the car chases. The unmistakable sound of the in-line 6 M49 engine on the E34 BMW//M5 ridden by D.Pierce is well known to M cognoscenti. The sound of the engine in the tunnel were dead on..  <br /> <br />I might be a bit biased here because I have an E39//M5 and I am a car person so I am more inclined to give the movie a 5 star rating just for the car chases (Audi S8 and //M5 chases) <br />I thought Jean Reno was also good in the movie, especially in the scenes with Deniro..  So is the movie worth seeing? The question is a no brainer for a car person specifically those aware of the //M5. Others I am not so sure.. <br />
B000002J09|5.0|Any words aren't enough for this masterpiece. Moreover, this is a genuine tribute to the anti-commerciality. Yes, indeed. Do you know why ?. Despite - and this is true, not a joke - Led Zeppelin is the most famous band after The Beatles and Pink Floyd, their albums weren't reviewed properly at that time. That situation colapsed when they released Led Zeppelin III. An extremely underrated masterpiece at that time. Every critic had his chance to say Led Zeppelin III wasn't a good album just because it was radically different that their previous blues-influenced albums. Most of Led Zeppelin III was acoustic, and it contained whole new rock style - Immigrant Song, Celebration Day, Out On The Tiles - as well.  <br /> <br />Led Zeppelin couldn't believe what was happening. They knew they've done an awesome breaking new album. They decided to be quiet, they didn't talk with the press after Led Zeppelin III. Nobody knew what was they've doing for their upcoming album. Blues ? Acoustic ? The doubt was huge. <br /> <br />In November 1971 their new album was released. Even with that release the mystery wasn't cleared at all, because what fans found was an LP with no title, no credits, no tracklisting... NOTHING. NOT EVEN A SINGLE WORD ( how many bands are dare to do that nowadays ?... Limp Biskit ? give me a break ) <br /> <br />The album was acclaimed - at last !! - and \\"Stairway To Heaven\\" became the most famous non single song from the music history. Yet today is still the most non single song from all times !!. <br /> <br />Wonderful, melodic, classic, powerful. This album is mind-blowing. Just listen to \\"The Battle Of Evermore\\" and then \\"When The Leeve Breaks\\". You'll be surprised and so excited. <br /> <br />They didn't need publicity for this album, unlike every - sold out indeed - \\"rock\\" band nowadays. <br /> <br />THIS IS TIMELESS MUSIC, NOT MTV COMMERCIALS. <br /> <br />
B0006399FS|1.0|I don't know how someone can compare Led Zeppelin IV with this insult to the former name of U2.  <br /> <br />This album sounds like it was written by a drunk, old, rich, and obviously bored numb men. Yet it still works for some mind-controlled fans. <br />The Lyrics are very poor and the music is mediocre, mundane and basiclly unispiring - compare it to The Joshua Tree and its actually like a bad joke of themselves. The Spirit of the U2 - the innovative, avant-garde and rebel band - is gone and it doesn't look like it will ever return. Unlike what some mindless teens say, this is not a return to their roots.  <br /> <br />Rather it's a return to buy more Grammy Awards and to make instant money by using their brand name U2. <br /> <br />What they created was a soulless corporate product that bore the name U2, but one that could not possibly live up to the U2 legacy. The music is sterile and over-produced and the lyrics are (thankfully) forgettable.  <br />This album is an absolute piece of crap and anyone with any musical sense would throw it out the window along with their media player for being tainted by this bland, vanilla, and sickening commercial use of the name U2. <br /> <br />If U2 still has something of respect to their fans - thing that I doubt it - they must cancel their stupid upcoming tour \\"how to steal even more money\\" and let the fans alone.  <br /> <br />NO MORE !!!!! <br /> <br />PS: yes, we are the old rebel U2 indeed. WIDE AWAKE <br /> <br />
B00028HBKM|1.0|I was disgusted by this movie.  It was a bloodfest that only got exposure because of the director.  I felt so dirty after Watching the movie that I took a shower.
B00004RF98|4.0|A previous poster complained that this movie was not in widescreen. While I am definitely an advocate of releasing movies in widescreen, a look at the date of this movie will reveal that it never was widescreen. Widescreen movies did not start until \\"The Robe\\" in 1953. <br /> <br />Perhaps the forementioned poster was confused by WB's error in placing a placard at the beginning of the movie, stating that it had been modified to fit the screen. 1.33:1 is most definitely the appropriate ratio for this movie.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Who-ever was responsible for the initial TV advertising for this series totally blew it.  I never even heard about it when it was on TV. <br /> <br />Even as a serious fan of all the star trek series, I would say the first few Firefly shows were as good as or better than any of the early star trek shows.  This is a true shoot-em-up western sci-fi with a bit of the campiness of the best of the Dr. Who series.  That's a weird combination, but they do a great job pulling it off. The acting and character development are excellent, and you quickly get drawn into the series.  If you compare it solely on plot and acting (it has limited special effects), it's in the running for the best sci-fi series ever produced.   <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B00005JMEW|2.0|The premise is sound enough: the lead character's family is destroyed by person[s] well known to him/her, and he/she seeks revenge. That much makes sense, in a movie-script kind of way, but much not else does. Like why for example.<br /><br />The killer sent to finish her off in the hospital puts on the white nurse uniform, down to the white nurse eyepatch with cute little red cross. There's just too much like that, silly details that work against whatever is trying to be believable. Like sitting on a plane, samurai sword at hand (?!), writing \\"Death List\\" in letters big enough for people to read from the back of the theater, or at least walking down the aisle in the plane. Or an opening quote, translated form the original Klingon. The shower-spray bleeding is another, especially when loss of blood doesn't seem to have any medical significance to that lawyer.<br /><br />That anime sequence didn't work for me either. It just made the movie look indecisive. Or that section in the big fight scene where everything turned black-and-white for about ten minutes. I really hope that was a defect on the disc I had, not something intended for dramatic effect - I just found it distracting.<br /><br />I like Thurman's work, especially in Gattaca. I like Liu's work. I like action/fight/babe movies. I liked the fight choreography, mostly. I just don't like this movie.<br /><br />//wiredweird
B0000035E7|5.0|This is Nirvanas first CD and one of there best. Before the fame and before the money, this Cd shows what nirvana, and the grundge scene, is all about. If  you have never heard of nirvana, what better place to start then the beginning. By this masterpiece instead of some simple plan or blink182 garrbage. Trust me, you'll  love this album.

Not only does he write his own lyrics, but plays his own piano, and guitar as well. Everyone no matter what age will love Chariot. I promise if you buy this c/d, you will not regret it. Every song is a hit! So buy Chariot by Gavin DeGraw right now!!!
B000003TA4|5.0|If you by this one, please listen to more songs then Smells Like Teen Spirit. there are many good tracks on this one, some even better than Teen Spirit.
B0000C1733|4.0|I rate this compalation 7/10, the new songs are great but a few singles are crucially missed and some songs shouldnt be on there.

And They should have got some decent artwork aswell, the back looks cooler than the front.

B00005O5CM|4.0|Legally Blonde succeeds because of the entertaining Reese Witherspoon.  Convincing as the ditzy blonde who proves to her snob boyfriend that she is just as smart as him (if not smarter).   There are plenty of hilarious scenes in this film providing a rewatch factor.  It's one of those films that is fun to watch if you have friends round.   <br /> <br />DVD SUMMARY:  Visually, almost reference quality and in 2:35 widescreen. Plenty of special features including about 8 deleted scenes.  Overall, worth buying. <br /> <br />Note:  I have avoided the sequel, however, based on the constant bad reviews. SOmetimes directors should quit while they are ahead.
B00005JNBQ|1.0|Do I need to review it? <br />It is one star because there is nothing less than one.
B000059RL3|5.0|How do you make a overly reissued album classic better?Well actually this one DOES-I love all the songs on 'What's Going On'-it's a great album but I always felt that it was highly overproduced.This one starts with the original followed by a different varriation on the same album called 'the original Detroit Mix'-THIS version is far more understated in the finest Donny Hathaway tradition and truely brings out the richness of Marvin's voice and the depth of his vision-the sparer arrangement actually better expresses the music's message of urban and environmental blight.There's still orchestration but it isn't mixed so high-also forcing one to acknowledge how great a pianist Gaye is.And that's why I highly recommend that those who purchased previous issues of this CD should go out and pick this sety up-that along with a bonus disk of live material and outtakes make this the definative version of this album-to such an extent myself baught this and gave my original CD issue of this album (in this case the tepid ripoff of 1994's so called 'deluxe edition') to my dad,a fellow music lover who I felt would benifit from having the album in his collection alongside his other classics like The Beatles White Album,Curtis Mayfield's Superfly and John Coltranes A Love Supreme where it belongs!For those who want to replace an old copy of this CD with a better one LOOK NO FURTHER!For those you for whatever reason haven't been initiated-well,what more can I say-there is no better place to come!
B00005QG9J|5.0|Before I write my review, just let me say: I understand where people are coming from saying that Incubus \\"sold out\\", making songs based on the huge success of their single \\"Drive\\". But that isnt true. When Drive became successful, this album was already almost done, so please, dont accuse them of selling out. Its expirementation, its evolution, and in my opinion it worked out wonderfully. Bands evolve, just like us human beings. If Incubus had decided to make 5 S.C.I.E.N.C.E's instead of expanding their sound, they would have been long gone by now. Now, onto the review. <br /> <br />Musically and lyrically, this album is very diverse. You have your pretty standard, angsty type of lyrics on songs like \\"Circles\\" and \\"11 AM\\", but other songs like \\"Nice To Know You\\" tread completely different territory. Nice To Know You is about Brandon Boyd breaking his arm, and finally regaining feeling in it. Only a band like Incubus could pull off a song like that. <br /> <br />Musically, this album is very interesting as well. You have your straight up alternative rock songs like Circles and Warning, but there are also softer, acoustic guitar driven tracks like 11 AM, Mexico and Aqueous Transmission. The latter being particularly interesting, as it contains a 'Kyo-Ku'-an instrument with an interesting sound, that is very foreign to Incubus and rock music itself. Other standouts include \\"Are You In\\", a very light and calm song that has kind of a jazzy feel to it, and \\"Blood On The Ground\\". Textbook Incubus, but impressive nonetheless. <br /> <br />Overall this is an album that I would recommend to anyone who was a fan of Incubus before and is willing to accept a little bit of change, or to anyone who's a fan of alternative rock. <br /> <br />Hightlights: Nice To Know You, Circles, Wish You Were Here, 11 AM, Blood On The Ground, Are You In
B00005JN0T|4.0|I think Will Smith is great on the screen.  Right off the bat, however, he does not need all the profanity his characters are spewing in the past several films.  That aside, this is pretty decent action film.  If you start thinking about Asimov because of the title and the three laws, you will likely hate the film.  However, if you can switch to Marvel Action Hero mode, then this film will seem superior.<br /><br />Will Smith plays Del Spooner who is a troubled soul (like a Marvel Hero, right?).  He has a recurring dream that is increasingly revealed to us throughout the film and he hates robots.  He is almost a Luddite in his attitude towards technology and its effects on human work (the Luddites were 19th century workers from Leicestershire who destroyed the machinery that made them redundant and thereby demonstrated a complete misunderstanding of economic well being and increased productivity - but that is another topic).  For some reason he is close to the supreme scientist of robotics at U.S. Robotics.  He is called in when that doctor apparently commits suicide.  The detective story unfolds from there and the action continually increases in pace.<br /><br />I do not want to reveal any more of the story because I think you will enjoy picking up the details for yourself.  Bridget Moynahan is pretty effective as the very closed robotics scientist, Susan Calvin.  And Alan Tudyk does a fine job voicing Sonny.  Tudyk was the pirate in Dodgeball and making the connection between the two roles is a testimony to his skills as a character actor.  Also, I want to single out Chi McBride. He is an excellent character actor who brings great presence and humanity to the roles he plays.  Here he plays Del Spooner's boss, Lt. John Bergin.  He is an important balance, protector, and foil for Spooner's extreme views and actions.  I mean everyone knows that Robots never commit crimes or hurt humans, right?<br /><br />The animation of the robots is not as effective as it could be.  At certain points they look like so many computerized ants.  However, when you get past that, the movie does work pretty well.  Just remember, think Marvel, not Asimov, and you will enjoy it more.At certain points they look like so many computerized ants.  However, when you get past that, the movie does work pretty well.

B000268QB2|5.0|I've waited a LONG time for a CD as good as this one and now that I've found it I want to share it with others. The music this group has put out on this disk is remarkable, especially against the junk that's out there on the air waves these days. These boys are talented in every way you can be-musically, lyrically,stylistically. THis disk flows in such a sweet way from start to finish to create a surreal listening experience. I want to put it in and just sit and listen with no other distractions. Put it in as background and it becomes the foreground as you tune other things out. I'm moved and you need to be too...don't wait just buy!
B00005JNBQ|4.0|For several weeks I had 3 friends bugging me about seeing some movie about \\"dweeby,\\" \\"nerdy\\" kids and how \\"stupid\\" they are. \\"So stupid it makes you laugh\\", said one friend.  <br /> <br />Finally, I rented Napoleon Dynamite and sat down and saw a pretty nice little story about some simple lives in a place I'll never get to go. When I got back to my friends, I told them it was a cool little movie and that i really enjoyed it, but they had forgotten to tell me it is about autism and functioning with that disorder.  <br /> <br />Now I am locked in disagreement with my friends. They say Napoleon and Pedro are not playing autistic teens but are just dumb nerds. I say Napoleon, Pedro, and possibly others, are very autistic and the signs are right there in the audio and video.  <br /> <br />Napoleon is not really \\"connected\\" to people or the normal flow of life. He tries to communicate but cannot connect anything more complicated than a question and an answer. Napoleon has a fascination with rythmic movement (dance) and spinning rotations (tetherball) - that's autism. Napoleon sometimes experiences rushes of emotion that he has no idea how to process and it freezes his brain - key the scene when he first sees the suit of clothes in the thrift store. Pedro is similarly also in his own world. It's very obvious.  <br /> <br />So, there you have it, the insightful movie I saw (and very much enjoyed) and the stupid movie my friends saw (and very much enjoyed). I guess ultimately we did agree. Napoleon Dynamite is a winner.
B00005JMXX|2.0|The visual effects in the movie are entertaining, but has little else to offer. <br /> <br />The idea behind the movie is a bit perposterous, but it is an action movie.  There are a few liberal political messages the movie sends, but at least it doesn't beat you over the head with them...much. <br /> <br />The climax of the movie is a bit anti-climactic.  When millions of people die, it seems a bit difficult getting involved in the struggles of a few individuals. <br /> <br />If you're in the mood for some high action, give this a try...providing you've exhausted some of the other higher rated action films.
055357342X|1.0|I admit this series is a good, not the better, fantasy novel but the ratings are too high I must bring it down. What I don't like in this series is that the author makes the characters Bipolar or have muliplte personality in order to change or make a new plot. It seems the personality of the characters the author has made is twisted suddenly to shift a plot. I guess it's one way to make the novel longer but the characters are all bipolar. I bought this book because of the ratings and I am bored with the frustration of the story. skip this series, read Wheel of Time instead.
B0000026NC|4.0|I believe there is something of a generation gap in terms of Pink Floyd fans' appreciation of this live double album released in 1988.  Older fans who experienced all of the band's genius in the 1960s and 1970s may have had a little trouble adjusting to the reconstitution of the band (without Roger Waters) in the 1980s.  As for me, I had only recently discovered the band at that time - 1987's A Momentary Lapse of Reason was actually the first Floyd CD I bought.  I had seen The Wall and was somewhat familiar with some of the classic cuts from Dark Side of the Moon, but Delicate Sound of Thunder was essentially my first real introduction to the musical mystique of Pink Floyd.  I happen to much prefer Roger Waters' vocals on vintage Floyd tracks, but I am still impressed with David Gilmour's vocals and the energy with which Waters' former band mates resurrected Pink Floyd after the bitter breakup of the band.  The fact that I really learned such songs as Comfortably Numb and Time from Gilmour's versions on this live album actually allows me to appreciate Waters' original vocals even more while never looking down on these recordings as inferior versions.  Had I been a fan of Pink Floyd since the beginning (and I would have been if I had been born a decade or two earlier), I imagine I would have had trouble adjusting to the Waters-less ensemble showcasing their wares here.  The only unhappy feelings I personally have toward this album come from the fact that I didn't get the chance to see them perform in the concert tour from which this music is derived.<br /><br />The fifteen tracks included on these two CDs represent a mix of the new and the timeless.  Five of the ten songs from 1987's A Momentary Lapse of Reason are included: Learning to Fly, The Dogs of War, On the Turning Away, Yet Another Movie, and Sorrow.  I happen to think AMLR was a great album, and the live performances of these songs really do them justice; On the Turning Away is a particularly incredible live track.<br /><br />Of course, one's attention is always fixed most closely on the timeless Pink Floyd songs.  Dark Side of the Moon is represented here by three songs: Time, Money, and Us and Them (of course, the second CD in 1995's Pulse contains a live performance of the entire Dark Side of the Moon album).  The backup singers do get to be a little annoying on the drawn-out version of Money.  Wish You Were Here supplies its own title track, an always-welcome addition to the fun, as well as this album's opening number Shine on You Crazy Diamond.  One of These Days stands out as the only purely instrumental track on the double album.  I am not a big fan of extended instrumental pieces, but Pink Floyd prove to be the exception to the rule - largely due to Gilmour's devastatingly impressive guitar work.  Shine on You Crazy Diamond always reminds me a little bit of the old Doctor Who theme song, and that bit of nostalgia only makes me enjoy the music even more.  This second disc closes with three songs from The Wall: the ever-popular Another Brick in the Wall Part II, Comfortably Numb (featuring a particularly scintillating guitar solo by Gilmour), and Run Like Hell.<br /><br />Delicate Sound of Thunder has, in some ways, been superseded by 1995's Pulse double live album - but a number of the timeless tracks found here on Delicate Sound of Thunder cannot be found there.  I can understand why some Floyd fanatics aren't overly impressed with this 1988 release, but a newly-reconstituted Pink Floyd (sans Waters) at slightly less than their best is still way, way better than almost everything else out there.  The fact that Gilmour and the guys could deliver such quality performances of songs so intimately associated with Roger Waters proves just how timeless the music of Pink Floyd is.k.

B000002LEE|5.0|Let's see. We have a great collection of songs by a band of extremely competent and creative musicians. Mountain Song, Had A Dad, Ocean Size, Pigs In Zen, Summertime Rolls, etc. are all powerhouse songs.  What is more interesting is the band itself. A helium-voiced singer. An unorthodox virtuoso guitarist who subverts the cliches of various musical genres with his live-wire soloing. A hyperkinetic rhythm section. The musical question that must be asked of the music-critic community that embraced this is why none of them liked this when Rush was doing it.   <br /> <br />Otherwise, Nothing's Shocking stands as a challenge to the alternative ethos that embraces musical incompetence and extroverted perversity.  Jane's Addiction had a lot of the latter and none of the former. Many questioned their alternative credentials becuase they could actually play, but ultimately had to (grudgingly) accept their alternative status becuase they did provide the requisite perversity.  This was some of the best music made in an otherwise disposable musical decade.  They don't make 'em like this any more.
B00005JNBQ|1.0|All I can say is that this is one of the most stupid and boring movies I've ever seen.  I can't even imagine what people think is funny about it. I tried hard to find something to laugh at, but I've been to funerals that had more humor.
B0000DD7LC|4.0|After the oversaturation of Alicia Keys' first album \\"Songs in A Minor\\", I was originally not interested in hearing Alicia's second album \\"The Diary of Alicia Keys\\". A year later, I decided to get the album because of Alicia's most recent single \\"If I Ain't Got You\\" which had grown on me considerably. I really am not a fan of r&b music so it is to my surprise that I found myself grooving to this album. \\"The Diary of Alicia Keys\\" is definitely a huge improvement over \\"Songs in A Minor\\". The sound is a lot looser and not as polished as its predecessor. There is less of a pop influence (although it is still there) but with a more r&b sound. I definitely can hear a little jazz in her music which I didn't hear on \\"Songs in A Minor\\". Thank heavens there is no \\"Falling\\" part two. That song got played into the ground no thanks to MTV/VH1 and radio. \\"Heartburn\\" sounds like it came out of the late '70s during the whole Foxy Brown, Shaft, Superfly funk era. I could definitely still here Alicia's classical influences like on the first track \\"Harlem's Nocturne\\".  I wish the song was a little longer though. \\"Karma\\" is another favorite song of mine. The song had a really good beat and I really dug the melodies. The one song that I really didn't care for was \\"Diary\\" w/Tony! Toni! Tone!. I didn't really care for the dialogue interspersed with the music. That got on my nerves. \\"Dragon Days\\" was a bit silly lyrically. Good melody but the title and lyrics I just found to be a bit silly. Overall I found \\"The Diary of Alicia Keys\\" to be much more enjoyable than \\"Songs in A Minor\\". Alicia has proven to me (at least) she is not some one hit wunderkind as a lot of people probably thought she was when her first album came out. There is a much more cohesive, looser sound on this album than on \\"Songs in A Minor\\". I think Alicia will be a force to reckon for years to come if she continues to create music as good  as what I just heard on this album.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|It makes me laugh to read reviews of movies peppered with poor spelling and the term 'worst movie I have ever seen.' These two things, to me, indicate two possibilities; a) They are either young and have no scope of cinematics to be making ANY judgement on ANY film. b) Just plain cannot relate to something due to (a). <br />If you cannot relate to this movies' quirks, which have so many parallels to reality, then you just simply won't understand the humor. For the people who been immersed in the clique-laden world of high school elitism, this movie will draw laughs from familiar situations with stereotyped characters. The fact that every character fits so neatly into their preconceived societal niches' makes this film hilariously nearsighted. The shallowness and superficial world of a high schooler is captured perfectly through the eyes of Napolean. Overall, this movie accomplishes what it was meant to do; show you a familiar setting through unfamiliar eyes, giving Napoleans' self absorbed, and warped perception of it many comic translations. <br /> <br />-GuyintheTV <br />'All judgements are final'
0671027344|4.0|So, I couldn't decide between 3 and 4 stars.  This book has issues.  But dammit, I liked it!  First off, this book is kind of Young Adult.  But Hey, so is The Little Prince, and I don't care if you're 50, you need to read that book.  So maybe that's not so bad.<br /><br />Secondly, it bites off Catcher in the Rye.  That whole coming-of-age, introspecitvely angsty teenage prodigy who-almost-cries-at-the-flash-of-a-girl's-smile thing was done 50 years ago.  However, being an avid Salinger fan myself (I named my car Zooey, from Franny and Zooey), I somehow enjoy this book about as much as Catcher(in my opinion Salinger's worst, and most overrated)!<br /><br />I guess with Charlie, the protagonist, you tend to feel sorry for his innocence and naivete and pull for him more.  With Holden Caulfield, you get so tired of his cynicism and passive-aggressiveness, you almost wish he would get it over with and kill himself.  However, Charlie is not only naive, but outrageously ignorant for a freshman.  I mean, when I was a freshman, I was a virgin to sex, drugs, and drunkeness, but I sure knew more /about/ them than Charlie!  It's almost embarrasing to hear him talk about them.<br /><br />And the writing style is creative and daring, however not by any means ultra-original.  The letter-writing approach, to cite just /one/ preexisting piece of literature, was also done in C.S. Lewis' Screwtape Letters.  It also carries some problems.  I think a previous review stated rather poignantly that the characters tend to be two-dimentional.  This is rather accurate, however maybe not so much of Charlie, since he(obviously) is the most dynamic character, and is honest in his day-to-day writing.  It is also kind of dry; more like a good story being told rather than being involved in the story.<br /><br />But the day-to-day letter style also made it hard to find a \\"day\\" to end reading!  I always was curious to see what was resolved \\"tomorrow\\" -- Kind of like a soap opera cliff hanger, I guess.  This aspect compelled me to finish it in 3 days.  Granted, this book ain't long, but I'm easily distracted.  It takes a lot for a book to hook me that way.<br /><br />Hell, it's got its problems, but they're rather forgivable.  I'll just go ahead and give 4 stars.  The main point is, in light of its flaws, at least you certainly aren't wasting your time with this book.o finish it in 3 days.

B00005PJ6M|4.0|Sequels rarely improve on the originals. Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey is bursting at the seams with wacky humor, craziness and invention. Yes, the first was a brilliant ride too but it doesn't live up to this.<br /><br />Keanu Reeves and Alex Winter are just great in their dual roles as good Bill and Ted and evil Bill and Ted robots from the future. I've never really seen Keanu as convincing in anything else, maybe it's the characters he chooses and not his talent. Too bad his biggest exposure has been as a wooden statue in the god-awful Matrix trilogy. But it's not just Reeves and Winter this time, William Sadler's Grim Reaper is also along for the ride and he steals the show like you've never seen before. Rufus isn't in this one for very long but William Sadler more than makes up for that.<br /><br />The plot is a bit much to swallow if you're not familiar with the mechanics of the original. A nasty old tyrant 700 years in the future sends evil robot Bill and Teds back through time in the phone booth time machines to kill the good Bill and Ted and prevent their perfect society taking over the world. Once dead Bill and Ted go to hell, challenge the Grim Reaper to a game of Battleship, visit God (after a spot of mugging in heaven), get help from a Martian, brought back from the dead, make good Bill and Ted robots and take on the evil Tyrant guy during a Battle of the Bands finale. Whew! Peter Hewitt (only 25 at the time) brings a bizarre sophistication to the sequel that wasn't present in the blandly shot first film. B&TBJ literally looks like a whacked-out cartoon come to life. The production design is very colorful and vivid, reminiscent of Tim Burton, only not crap.<br /><br />Don't misjudge this film as being in the same sub-genre as those awful stoners Jay and Silent Bob or even Wayne's World. This is not a dumb generation Xer film, it's a lovely, silly fantasy for all ages and is definitely superior to the original.<br /><br />Hey Warner, hurry up and release the Bill and Ted animated series on DVD. I want it NOW! Unlike Excellent adventure, this film was shot in plain-old 1.85:1 and the anamorphic transfer on the DVD looks fine and does justice to the very broad color pallet of film. The soundtrack is in Remastered Dolby 5.1 and it sounds above average if not amazing.

B0006HXXBA|5.0|Holy (...), there isn't a song on the album that isn't good. That is so rare. Mille and crew are just as raw as they were 20 years ago. I can't take this out of my cd player.

B0002858YS|4.0|Finally, a new band with talent, charisma and a great beat that you can dance to. The Killers have been influenced by the best -T-Rex, Camouflage, Blondie, Depeche Mode. \\"Somebody Told Me\\" will remind you of Blur's \\"Girls and Boys.\\" But the music is fresh, modern and very distinct from the over-produced top 40 non-variety that spills from the radio today. The lead singer has fantastic stage presence and an intensity that commands the audience. I hope this band reaches the success it deserves and that there is more to come.

This book breaks through all the excuses in a funny way.  \\"Just too busy to call\\"  \\"Need to concentrate on work this month\\" or, my favorite \\"I need time to sort out my feelings\\" were examined.  All = He is just not that into you.  It's an eyeopener.
0316172324|4.0|Gladwell is an outstanding writer and storyteller and his new book offers interesting stories and food for thought.  However, it falls far short of his blockbuster The Tipping Point.<br /><br />Blink is about the intuitive response, the pattern recognition that happens almost instantaneously, and allows us to recognize faces and complex, non-verbal communication.  Gladwell seldom uses the term intuition, referring to this phenomenon as the adaptive unconscious.  He offers a series of fascinating stories focusing on the process he calls \\"thin-slicing,\\" the process of recognizing and making a decision based on incredibly small amounts of data.  One example shows people accurately predicting which married couples will stay together based on only two seconds of videotape.<br /><br />He offers the premise that decisions made very quickly can be every bit as good as decisions made cautiously and deliberately.  However, he acknowledges that this same process can often result in bad decisions and offers little guidance on how to make the process more reliable.
6305537321|4.0|I like this movie. Yes, she's a materialistic playgirl and he has a sugar mama, but there's about it that is appealing. Maybe it's the hopeful optimism or Holly's strange sweetness that just makes you want to fix her life. There's some comic relief (especially in the party scene), despite Rooney's ridiculous portrayal of a Japanese guy. And, who would have thought one could live without sterling silver telephone dialer? What a great concept. Too bad my cell doesn't have a rotary dial.
B00004SZWD|5.0|Few albums have ever achieved the wisdom, thematic unity, and melodic consistency of this, Stevie Wonder's greatest achievement.

I simply love everything about it.
B00004RF98|5.0|Gene Kelly, the Roaring 20s, and all the movie musical magic... it doesn't get any better.
B00005JLWN|4.0|My advice is to give this movie a change. It seems familiar, almost hackneyed.  I saw elements of the emotion control form \\"THX-1138,\\" the Prozium from \\"Brave New World,\\" the indoctrination chambers from the 1984 Apple commercial, and the firemen from \\"Fahrenheit  451.\\" Costume-wise, this film owes everything to \\"The Matrix.\\" This , by the way, was my biggest hang-up: is this is merely a remake of \\"The Matrix,\\" then forget, we have the original. If it is different, stop confusing us my associating it with \\"The Matrix.\\" <br /> <br />This cobbling and pastiche, however, last for about the first third of the movie. From then, it becomes it's own film.  Wimmer seems to use the clichs and stereotypes as a springboard for his own story.  In this sense, it is a variation of dystopic films, such as \\"Blade Runner,\\" \\"Brazil,\\" and \\"1984.\\"  Wimmer merely adds \\"guns martial arts,\\" and the oh-so-present Japanese flavor typical in today's movies. <br /> <br />Additional, he adds stunning visuals and rare cinematography in the vein of Fritz Lang or Orson Welles.  The Wells connection is obvious-the dropped snow-globe, and Dominic Purcell (Seamus) bears an odd resemblance to the Fat One. <br /> <br />This is a \\"Rage Against The Machine\\" story, hence the bows and curtsies to Lucas, Orwell, and Bradbury.  Additionally, the Mother Of All \\"Rage Against The Machine\\" novels, \\"Atlas Shrugged,\\" was also alluded to in the move: remember that large atlas statue in the office that seemed so out-of-place?  That is a nice tribute to Ayn Rand. <br /> <br />One of Rand's talking points was the idea of the Renaissance as the beginning of humans as humans.  That is why the image of the burning of the Mona Lisa is so important: this society that values peace at any cost actually dehumanizes humanity. Once passions are gone, we no longer are humans. Or, as C. S. Lewis put it, we are \\"men without chests.\\" <br /> <br />I highly recommend this film, since it has all the action and energy of \\"The Matrix\\"-style films, without all of the Junior High philosophizing that bogs the film down.  Hint: \\"There is nothing new under the sun,\\" (Ecclesiastes 1:9).
B00009W0U4|1.0|Unfortunately, the damage done to people who watch this film does seem, by all accounts, to be irreversible. More unfortunate still is that some of us did not wish to have this irreversible damage inflicted upon us. These people should include:    1.)Those who do not think a film need run through the entire A to Z of pretentious ideas that can be fit into 97 minutes, from annoying droning noises, to cameras shots that spin around wildly for no apparent reason, and of course, the most pretentious of them all (and may film-makers everywhere please take note-this one is really wearing out its novelty) the story that gets told backwards.    2.) Those who enjoy nice cinematography, the film's one redeeming feature. This is because it is for the most part never really shown off until the film's end/beginning, as prior to that the screen is mostly filled with dark and murky sets, seemingly never-ending scenes of violence and rape and general blur (yes, blur. As before mentioned, somebody thought that entry W of the Pretentious Ideas For A Pretentious Movie Encyclopaedia, i.e. the entry, Whirling Camera Shots, would be a fantastic idea, and that it was imperiative that a quarter of the film be shot with the aid of this ingenious technique.

B0004Z33G4|2.0|What a waste! How else can I say it? The Special Editions had trailers, great documentaries, and informative production notes on top of that. Why didn't they include the deleted scenes?! That's the only thing of value on these new Ultimate Editions, because all the rest is missing. If it really was an \\"ultimate\\" set, they would have included all the previously released great extras. (For those with the far-superior Special Editions, don't bother replacing yours with these; even the deleted scenes aren't anything to get worked up about, with possible exception of First Blood's alternate ending.)

B000068TPN|1.0|This is quite possibly the worst Vietnam War movie in the last 30 years. If you want a cheerleading movie loosely based on the war, then this is for you. But if you care about historical accuracy and realism, save yourself the trouble. From the cheesy last words of dying soldiers to the ridiculous portrayals of leaders standing fully upright on the battlefield and bravely gunning down enemies while everyone else is clinging to the ground, this movie makes almost no attempt to be a realistic portrayal of war. Heck, the producers didn't even bother filming it in realistic scenery. I had high hopes for this movie, but even before seeing it I started hearing rumblings from Vietnam vets who saw it and were tremendously disappointed. I thought their complaints were the exaggerations of overly-technical demands for historical accuracy, but if anything I thought their complaints were mild after I saw it for myself. There have been many good movies about the Vietnam in the last few decades. Sadly, this is definitely not one of them.
1400032717|4.0|I came across this book at Heathrow Airport in March 2004 as a book for the plane ride home. I had not heard or seen other reviews at the time I had only the jacket to go by.

B00005JN0T|4.0|This is a very good film that is just a little bit away from being excellent.  The acting is spot on - particularly Will Smith, who would be the only American I could ever picture playing James Bond.  Even in a film like this where all of the actors around him have grim expressions and are deadly serious, you can tell that Smith is enjoying what he's doing, and as a result you enjoy riding along with him.<br /><br />The plot of the film is relatively complex, involving a robot who may have killed his creator.  There are a couple of twists and turns near the end, but even the events that are unexpected won't floor you the way that most people were when they saw The Usual Suspects.  It is this lack of total surprise that makes this film very good instead of great, and is the major problem when you see that it is \\"inspired by\\" the Asimov stories, as opposed to based on them.  That said, even if you do see the major developments coming the first time you saw the film, it's worth watching I, Robot a second time because there are subtle clues embeded from almost the very beginning.<br /><br />The DVD has a couple of special features, including a director commentary, that are mediocre; if you keep the subtitles on while you watch the commentary you are far more likely to become engrossed in the film again rather than listening to what the director had to say.<br /><br />The bottom like is that the film itself is very good, the special features are nothing special, but if you like sci-fi, this is the best film to come out since Star Trek: First Contact, ironically, another James Cromwell film.
B000654YRY|4.0|I really liked this DVD.  It took a long time to get it upon its release (almost two months), but it is more than worth the wait.<br /><br />The production value is very high.  There is a nice opening sequence where the band and roadies arrive at the venue, and get ready to put on the show.  The DVD uses this sequence to introduce the players, showing them getting off of busses, walking down corridors, and other mundane predatory actions.  Knopfler walks out to a very enthusiastic crowd and after a few seconds of thunderous applause launches into the first song.  I was very happy (as a guitar player myself) that many of his solos were shown in close-up detail.  I like little things like that, seeing how he works to get that sound.  I will not go over every song, but just be sure, there is not a single piece of filler here, although there would be a couple of songs that might be considered MIA.  I could not imagine seeing B.B. King in concert without his performing \\"The Thrill is Gone\\", so seeing Dire Straits and not having them perform the break through \\"Sultans of Swing\\", the song that introduced them to the world is a bit strange.  Oh well, you can't have everything.  There is a good mix of rockers, softer more mellow songs and plenty of opportunity for Knopfler to let the other members of the band show off a bit.  Overall, a great performance.<br /><br />The one weakness that requires me to go with 4 stars rather than 5 is the fact that this is a medium that can offer so much more in terms of sound.  That this is not offered in some form of 5.1 is a crime.  I love concerts on DVD when you hear the crowds behind you and the music hits from many angles.  If I gave this basic two-channel stereo rendering a 5 star rating, it would not be fair to the other DVDs out there that earned their 5s with terrific audio engineering.  If this was a 1980s VHS tape, it would be a 5, but for a DVD introduced in the year 2005, two-channel stereo can't be given a perfect score for a concert performance.e for a concert performance.  <br /> <br />  <br />
B0002OERI0|5.0|Before hearing this album, I never put much stock in Green Day. To me, they were always just a goofy punk-pop band that my eight year old liked. Imagine my surprise when a friend told me that their new album, \\"American Idiot\\", was a second coming of The Who's \\"Tommy\\". I borrowed the CD from my son, and was instantly blown away. <br /> <br />\\"Blvd. of Broken Dreams\\" is one of the most haunting rock songs of the past twenty years. During my first listen to this album, I played it five times in rapid succession. \\"Jesus of Suburbia\\" is biting, scathing, and really funny. And the title track is the perfect anthem for those of us who feel that America has really lost her place in the world. <br /> <br />Well, I'm converted. Even if you're not a Green Day fan, pick up this album. You will be a superfan by the end of the first track.

B0002DB52M|4.0|Don't avoid seeing a movie because of the running time. Yes, \\"Dogville\\" is three hours long. Yes, there are almost no sets. But \\"Dogville\\", which has been accused of being anti-American but absolutely isn't, is one of the best films of 2004. <br /> <br />Set in a fictional Rockie mountains town in the 1930s, \\"Dogville\\" tells the story of Grace (Nicole Kidman, in a tour-de-force performance), a woman on the run, being chased by vicious mobsters. In Dogville, she finds temporary asylum and love, in the form of Tom (Paul Bettany, also terrific). But when the people of Dogville turn on someone, they really turn. <br /> <br />I really liked the ending of this film, but I won't give anything away. <br /> <br />The fantastic ensemble cast includes Lauren Bacall, James Caan, Chloe Sevigny, Patricia Clarkson, Philip Baker Hall, and Stellan Skarsgaard. <br />
B0006FO8RA|1.0|Rarely has someone been so famous for so little, and that fact shines through in \\"Greatest Hits: My Prerogative.\\" While much-publicized pop star Britney Spears has produced four albums thus far, all that becomes clear in her \\"greatest hits\\" is that her music has never been that good, and it's only getting worse.<br /><br />This contains several of her hit singles, arranged in no particular order -- expect to bounce madly between slinky technopop and bouncy bubblegum with no logic in mind -- the obvious hits like \\"I'm A Slave 4 U\\" (future bondage-porn soundtrack?), \\"... Baby One More Time\\" and \\"Oops!... I Did It Again\\" are set alongside much lesser pop hits like \\"Toxic,\\" the flaccid Madonna duet, and several others that were more or less forgotten.<br /><br />Like virtually any other greatest hits album, it has some bonus materials. There are from several remixes, none of which are too good -- for example, the Darkchild Remix of \\"Overprotected\\" is a clattery, feedback-laced affair. Spears also releases several previously unheard songs, such as the generic \\"I've Just Begun (Having My Fun)\\" and equally dull \\"Do Somethin'.\\" The most hyped song is \\"My Prerogative,\\" an electropop cover of a Bobby Brown song -- with lyrics like \\"I don't need permission/I make my own decisions,\\" it sounds like an immature, defiant finger-flip at the world. Good luck with that.<br /><br />Usually \\"Greatest Hits\\" albums are put out for one of two reasons. Either a band/singer has been around for eons and has enough glorious songs to fill an entire album, or the label they are/were signed to is trying to cash in. For the latter, think \\"Best of Mandy Moore,\\" which Ms. Moore had nothing to do with. Sadly, Spears' \\"Greatest Hits\\" album is neither -- instead, it feels like an effort to keep her at the forefront of music store displays.<br /><br />Her music is pretty standard for whatever kind of pop is attempted -- polished and overproduced. And, I might add, very predictable -- virtually every blip and note can be detected before it's heard. While \\"Toxic\\" has a halfway decent beat and some electric violins, Spears strikes out with her newer pop melodies, especially the ones that sound a lot like No Doubt covers.<br /><br />Her image also veers wildly through the various songs, starting off with the sound of a giggly teen who has done something naughty. Then she's launching into the more sexual stuff, especially in the horribly-written \\"Outrageous\\" (\\"Outrageous!/My sex drive/Outrageous!/My shopping sprees....\\"). But it doesn't feel genuinely sexy -- rather it feels like a little girl dressing up in mommy's lingerie.<br /><br />And Spears' vocals have never been too good -- her early material displays a voice that is pretty typical for a teenage girl. It has little range, and it's a sort of breathy, thin voice. That doesn't last -- her voice deteriorates over the more recent tracks from her fourth album, becoming drier and more computerized. The sound peaks in \\"My Prerogative,\\" where Spears sounds like a congested robot.<br /><br />Everyone has an opinion on Spears' much-publicized love life, but the quality of her pop music is pretty clear. While her early material was innocuous in a teen pop sort of way, her pop ditties have only deteriorated with time.rtually every blip and note can be detected before it's heard.

0385510454|2.0|The Broker is definitely not his traditional southern lawyer thriller. In fact, most of it takes place in Europe and it reads more like a Tom Clancy spy novel. Grisham leaves a lot of loose ends and there is not much of a late plot twist as is customary of his novels. It was pretty predictable after you got a good grip on the storyline. He also introduces a few characters that seem like they'll play an integral role in the plot, but Grisham makes them disappear as quickly as they appear. You're left wondering why he even wrote them into the story to begin with.    <br /> <br />I give it a C- overall. I hope Grisham does better next year, although I suspect that his publisher was pressuring him to move away from his traditional work.
B00030IZY0|5.0|For everybody who loves the 80's this is a great DVD because you can feel the energy of this decade in the voice of one of the most important singers at that time the great \\"Cyndi Lauper\\".
0790732254|4.0|When i first thought of watching the movie, I was afraid of maybe being disappointed, but it turned out to be amazing. The actors have done a very good job. They are the perfectly incarnations of the characters Albee thought up. This movie shows the stunning truth of the illusion of happy marriage \\"for as long as we both shall live\\". The only thing I don't like is the scene where the location changes. It's not in the book.   <br /> <br />The story is about two couples having a little party in the middle of the night. Having drunken much alcohol terrible things happen and illusions break up. An astonishing film. An absolutely must!
0312995423|5.0|I bought the book for my cousin for Christmas at first. I decided not to read it before giving it to her, since it's about computers and stuff. Then, I started flipping through the pages, and didn't put down since then. <br />It's not really the story that got me interested, it's more of the crytography that made me so curious and kept me going. It's wonderful!
B000000OUJ|5.0|This album dropped back in 1995, and ten years later, it is still one of my favorite's. The reason being simple; The GZA is a Genius. He is without a doubt one of the sharpest lyricist to ever bless a microphone. I agree with the popular opinion on this website, that this is the best Wu-Tang solo album. The RZA'a production and the GZA's verbal assault are a perfect marriage. Although all of the tracks are hot, \\"Living in the World Today\\" is the quintessential showcase of the GZA's pure talent. He attacks the track like only he can, twisting an arsenal of jabs and powerhouse rights, with his unique cadence and inflection. Although he is perhaps the most respected clansman among the Wu and fans, he has never attained a strong popular following due to his disinterest in diverting from his roots as a true street MC. Whenever I grow tired of the rappers of today, I feel thankful that I can drop in this CD and get-down to some real hip-hop.
0385513755|5.0|This book is wonderful for collection! With relating pictures almost on each page to go along with the text, it's like you're in the adventure too! They add the sense of excitement! If you're a Dan Brown fan, this is a MUST get!
B000002U8G|5.0|I love this album. All the way from the start with One of These Days and the orcish sounding threat of cutting you into little pieces to the spiritual tour de force that is Echoes. The first time I heard Echoes I swore there was no lyrics in it. Turns out there are lyrics and I was that lost in the music that I didn't notice, that is powerful. A Pillow of Winds is quite the pretty and relaxing song. It is one of my favorites. Fearless is a very enjoyable song even with the soccer chanting sound in the background. San Tropez sounds like a song that Syd Barrett should be singing. It a good song but it doesn't match the others on this album. Then we have Seamus, oh Seamus, I'm taking it that Seamus is someone in the band's dog. It's a cute song where a dog howls almost to the beat of the song but it can get very repetitive if you're not careful and ends with the aforementioned Echoes. A must have for any Floyd fan.
B000000WA4|1.0|Are people still listening to this garbage?  This album stinks.  Everything bad about 90s alternative rock is at its worst on this album==pityful \\"woe-is-me\\" lyrics, \\"chunk-a-chunk-chunk\\" guitars, muddy walls of distorted guitar noise, and the obligatory power ballad (\\"Tonight Tonight\\") tailor made for adult contempory radio stations.   <br /> <br />What were people thinking in 1995?  Did the whole world go insane?  I don't know how anyone could find any musical value in this album.  \\"Meloncoly and the Infinate Sadness\\" is almost like a caricature of all the other 90s grunge bands.  The songs average 8 minutes in length, there are 28 songs, and it completely takes up two discs.  The teenage angst and distorted walls of guitar noise typical of all the other grunge bands are taken to such a ridiculous extreme by the Smashing Pumpikns, that it sounds more like a tongue-in-cheek parody than a serious album. <br /> <br />I don't recommend this CD to anybody unless you want to annoy yourself with bad music.
B000002U9W|4.0|Alright to a new Pink Floyd fan I say run away now. Get anything made after this album. This is my least favorite Floyd album and I still listen to it alot. Which tells you that I'm stuck listening to Floyd about 95% of my music listening time. The first song has about 5 names but is more simply known as Atom Heart Mother Suite. This song is hard to explain, it's like taking whatever Syd Barrett was taking, then going to church, then riding through the country and coming home to go to sleep. There is that much depth to the song. I love the female singing in the song, this is where the spiritual part comes from. Gilmour as always plays the guitar to perfection. The second song is If, very interesting song that I like alot. The third and fourth songs, Summer 68 and Fat Old Suns are both very good lyrically and in musicianship. The last song is well a continuation of the trip the first song takes you on. This is not recommended for anyone who thinks 20 minute songs are a waste. This is meant for someone who enjoys the wonderful sounds of a guitar, oh and someone chewing. It's an odd album but with time it will grow on you. If you are starting a Floyd collection save this for last.
B00003CXCT|3.0|Being born in the late 70s, I have not known life without the Star Wars Triology.  My father was a big fan, and I remember that as a small child I would BEG my parents to get me my very own Ewok.<br /><br />My husband is also a huge Star Wars fan, and he begged and pleaded for me to get the DVD triology for him for Christmas, even though we already have the VHS version.<br /><br />Please know that this is NOT the original!  Yes, some of the changes are quite good...the better picture quality, improved special effects.  However, other changes were rather disappointing. Maybe Lucas never heard the saying \\"If it ain't broke, don't fix it.\\"  For one, my husband was quite mortified that the \\"Han Solo shot first\\" scene was changed.  After all, that was a big part of his character!  I, on the other hand, could handle the small changes on the first two DVDs...it was not until the end of \\"Return of the Jedi\\" that I became outraged.  Okay, I can handle the extra celebration scenes...I can maybe even understand changing the Anakin Skywalker image to coincide with the new movies (although, I do agree with another reviewer...this itself was quite a stretch...how does Luke even know him?)  But HOW DARE THEY mess with my Ewok song?  What was wrong with it?  I kept waiting and waiting...and it never came!  I actually felt empty without it...so much so that I asked my husband to put in the VHS tape so I could hear it and have some closure!<br /><br />So, while the DVDs have their own strong points, I will never get rid of the original.  And a note to anyone who may attempt to redo Star Wars in the future...(my husband pointed out that they are almost 30 years old...I can't be that old, can I?)...bring back the Ewok song!

0425098478|3.0|I was referred to the One Minute Manager series when I asked someone I considered an excellent manager if he could recommend some management resources.  The One Minute Manager introduces readers to the three techniques of one-minute management - clear goal setting, one-minute praisings and one-minute reprimands. <br /> <br />The points are laid out clearly and the recommendations simple and easy to implement.  The book can be read quickly in a single sitting or several short pages at a time.  Those with very little time can read the four pages that summarize all the points made in the book. <br /> <br />What bothered me about the book was the portrayal of the business world as a very male environment.  A young man looks for the perfect manager and finds the amazing One Minute Manager, referred to throughout the book as, \\"quite a guy!\\"  The male employees, described by age, explain goal setting and praisings.  The female employees, described with adjectives indicating their dress or competence, are secretaries, those providing general info, or those being reprimanded.  All but one of the acknowledgements are to men as are all but one endorsement.  The authors use sports - golf, football and bowling, as analogies, making for a tone off-putting to female readers.  Only on the last page does a young woman come to the formerly young man, now a successful One Minute Manager, seeking advice. <br /> <br />It's not a bad book, if you can ignore the gender stereotypes, but it's also quite basic.  I learned more from the One Minute Manager Builds High Performing Teams. <br />
B00004SVID|5.0|This is, in my honest opinion, my favourite Pink Floyd album. I have all the others, spanning from 'Piper At The Gates of Dawn' to 'The Division Bell;' and this one just knocks the socks off all the others. <br />Pink Floyd really has fully matured for this album, after being well baked. (The Final Cut is when they were overcooked and burnt).  They also add some dark humour to the act such as scripting the introducer to say 'No, the band isn't ready yet, but one thing I would like to point out after the show-' and then the band blasts 'In The Flesh?' to an unsuspecting audience.   <br />The album consists of the Wall entirely, plus two additional tracks Water's originally intended for the Wall.   <br />It also contains two detailing booklets showcasing the on stage performances, and how they executed them, along with writings from all four bandmates. <br />For those of you who are bored with the Wall, or simply don't think it is very good, buy this album. It makes all the difference.  This is an essential album for all you fellow Floyd Heads, compareable (if not better) to the other great live album, 'Live At Pompeii.' <br />
0823003035|4.0|Des images léchées. Des rendus à couper le souffle. Des dessins irréprochables. Mais...<br />Si vous voulez apprendre à dessiner, ce livre n'est pas pour vous. Je m'explique: Si vous vous attendez à un livre explicatif où on décrit étape par étape tout le processus pour en arriver à une oeuvre achevée, vous risquez d'être déçus. M. Ryder a étudié avec des maîtres réputés et enseigne lui-même d'ailleurs (voir son site internet) mais j'ai eu l'impression, en lisant ce livre, d'avoir été laissé dans le mystère. <br />Plusieurs étapes du processus de dessin ont été escamotées ou restent -volontairement?- nébuleuses (la fameuse \\"enveloppe\\" par exemple). De plus, vous n'apprendrez pas à dessiner au sens propre du mot. Vous apprendrez à reproduire, ce qui est légèrement différent. Tous les dessins de Ryder sont d'après modèles. Rien sorti de sa tête, si on peut dire. <br />Bref, si vous cherchez un livre motivant qui vous pousse à vous dépasser, ce livre peut vous servir. C'est son principal mérite, d'après moi. <br />Si vous aimez ce livre, vous serez peut-être interessés par un de ses professeurs: Ted Seth Jacobs. Tous en anglais.
B000068FY0|5.0|The first album were Rick Davies recruited a functioning, workable, contributing band, is also (in my opinion) their greatest. With the now complete lineup of Davies, Hodgson, Siebenberg, Helliwell and Thopson, Supertramp riffed off into stardom with their first big hit album and possibly their most celebrated. <br />Crime Of The Century consists of two stories, which both took place respectively on their original LP sides, side one consisted of School, Bloody Well Right, Hide In your Shell, and Asylum. Side Two was Dreamer, Rudy, If Everyone Was Listening, and Crime of the Century. <br />Side one was the story of the charachter Jimmy Cream, his youth, coming of age, and eventually, insanity. His story bears very creepy similarities to that of Pink Floyd founder Syd Barrett..... <br />Side Two is about Rudy, a quiet, brilliant and corrupted person who eventually commits the 'Crime Of The Century.' <br />This is the closest Supertramp got to Pink Floyd, and to me, they did much better.  They found a defined style and stuck with it for latter albums, however those latter albums (save 'Brother Where You Bound') didn't seem to stick to that sound. <br />Definitely a must have for Pink Floyd lovers, Supertramp lovers, prog and art rock lovers, and in my opinion, the greatest album of all time.
B00005JNBQ|4.0|There are two rival trends today in Mormon comedy. The first, and more unsuccessful, IMHO, embraces the \\"Singles Ward\\" family of films. There are a mixture of the solid Hale Family of thespians, with a mixture of the Brigham Young University's \\"Divine Comedy\\" and \\"Garrens\\" troupes.  They have the more slapstick, and even  Church Talent Night feel to them. In essence, they are the Jay Leno's of Mormondom.<br /><br />The other trend are the independent humorists, such as [...] and this film Napoleon Dynamite.  They are outside the normal institution and organs of Mormon humor, and therefore had to struggle to make their comedy work.  They are the David Lettermens of the Mormondom.  Which is why they are actually funnier.<br /><br />What can I say about this film?  When you present an anti-hero as hero, your competition is primarily the \\"Revenge of the Nerds\\" franchise.  To his credit, Hess is able to have the same vibe, transplant it to southern Idaho, and throw in some Theater of the Absurd to boot.<br /><br />That is what you are getting, and that is why the film works with so many people.  If, as Carl Matheson assets, \\"The Simpsons\\" humor is \\"hyper-irony,\\" then this film's humor is \\"hyper-quirkiness.\\"  It melds Seinfeld \\"A show about nothing,\\" with Babbitt's mediocrity.  The dialogue is two steps above drivel, but that is the charm of the movie.  You get a series of \\"A Slice Of Life\\" themes that are like the prop GNDN tubes on Star Trek: \\"Goes Nowhere, Does Nothing.\\"<br /><br />Sometimes I got he feeling that I was watching a so-called \\"reality show,\\" where a person makes no real intellectual or moral development in the process of the film.  Maybe ND is just a good natured Forrest Gump shipwrecked in Idaho.<br /><br />I think the key to the movie is ND's conceptual reference point. He reminds me of Calvin from the funnies-some panels Hobbes is a stuffed tiger, but in the more interesting panels Hobbs is as alive as Calvin's parents.  C. S. Lewis mentions that he had this same problem growing up: he had the external realm of studies and family, but he has the vibrant inner world of Wagner and Boxon, which at times, was more real than the so-called real world (Surprised By Joy, Chapter 8).<br /><br />ND has the same problem. He speaks of the liger, with it's magical properties, has the retro-80's \\"Pegasus Crossing\\" sign on his door, and the poster to the classic film \\"Dragonslayer.\\"  He is obsessed with nun-chucks and judo skills, but doesn't quite understand why he should wear the kung-fu pants.  He buys the suit at the Deseret Industries thrift store, but doesn't see that it looks weird, even with his retro 70's looks in the retro 80's town.  For ND, his clothes have become so old, they are back in style again.<br /><br />So there you have him: the fluctuating reference point-he has not quite left the magical stage that most of us leave in out early teens (See \\"The Road Less Traveled, p. 86-87).  This magical point of view is his charm is. He is a man-child like Brian Wilson or Wildman Fischer.  If Napoleon grows up, he will either be a total failure, or a monumental success.  With the white horse, things for Napoleon is looking up.<br /><br />NOTE:  for the love of mud, DO NOT DO A SEQUAL!  This film has to end as abruptly as it began.  ND has to stay a retro 70's teenager in a retro 80's town lost somewhere in the retro 00's.

I really like this song, very catchy. <br />Always: Kind of slow but there is nothing wrong with it. <br />Wanted Dead or Alive:A Bon Jovi classic. I LOVE THIS SONG, <br />I've heard it like 400 times and I still dig it. <br />Lay Your Hands on Me:Sounds a little too much like a christian song but it is still good. <br />You Give Love A Bad Name: This is a really cool song, I like this song too. The chorus is really good and catchy. <br />Bed of Roses:Kind of sad sounding song, but it is really good. <br />Blaze of Glory:A really cool song from one of the \\"Young Guns\\" <br />soundtracks, I like the chorus. <br />Prayer '94:A slower version of LOAP, which kind of sucks. <br />Bad Medicine:A good song, good music and good lyrics. <br />I'll Be There For You:This Song is Very Cool,There 5 words I swear to you. <br />In & Out of Love:I really like this song, it is well done and the lyrics flow well.  <br />Runaway:The music in the beginning is good. And the lyrics which are very clear are really good. <br />Well, there you have it. Bon Jovi Rules! A. <br />

B0002858YS|1.0|The Killers are a band trying to get in on the new wave of dance-punk bands. There are obvious Cure and Cars influences, and also newer influences such as Franz Ferdinand. <br />I am a fan of Franz Ferdinand because they did something new, there wasn't anything like them being played mainstream last spring, until the killers came along with their keyboard and bad vocals. <br />This album starts out with a kick,not a big kick but a kick you might expect from a 3-legged dog with a brain tumor, keyboards, guitars, dance-drumbeats, and mundane vocals that are semi-shouted. As the album progresses nothing changes, no songs stand out, none of it stays with you. It's extremely forgettable and frankly, it disgusts me. <br />Please don't spend your money on this slbum if you claim to be a fan of good music. Please.
B000007MVM|4.0|This is a great album, but it will appeal to only about one in a thousand people. Syd had truly lost his mind in a sea of acid and music-hall reminisences. He created some mad, yet beautiful and even deep pop tunes. I hate Pink Floyd, but I love Syd. It will not click on the first listen. If it doesn't click on the second listen, check out the more acessible \\"Piper at the Gates of Dawn\\", and than try again. If on the fifth try it still doesn't click, just give up, because this obviously will not appeal to you.
B000002G7E|4.0|White Light/White Heat primarily reveals the hard, dissonant side of this legendary group in short driving songs like the title track and the album's magnum opus, the turbulent Sister Ray, a 17-minute assault of electric guitars and hypnotic drumming. The Gift is a rather macabre story of a guy who had himself posted to his sweetheart in a big box. This type of spoken narrative also surfaces on their third album in The Murder Mystery and in John Cale's solo career, in a song like The Jeweller.<br /><br />There are also more delicate songs on White Light/White Heat, like the gently droning Lady Godiva's Operation and the subdued Here She Comes Now. I Heard Her Call My Name is a potent piece of garage rock with feedback and chugging rhythm, and then the glorious Sister Ray showcases the awesome power of the Velvets in 17 mesmerising minutes. In a sense, this song is the full realisation of the style that first surfaced on the Banana album in songs like Heroin and European Son.<br /><br />By the time this album was recorded, the gothic chanteuse Nico had left. In my opinion, White Light/White suffers from her absence as she contributed much to the atmospheric world-weariness of the debut. There is some variety on White Light/White Heat but the harsh and chaotic, \\"heavy metal\\" sound is predominant. The rating of four stars is in comparison to the five star debut album; as an example of primal hard rock, this album is equal to the best of the genre.
B00005JGAB|5.0|Look at the year '76. Lame artists such as Peter Frampton, Boston, and Emerson, Lake, & Palmer. Now you get the idea of how much we needed to be saved. Than, God, the Devil, and man combined forces to create the Ramones' debut album. Rock 'n' roll was alive again and thriving thanks to these four goofballs. Deep topics such as horror films, unbearable children, and dancing were discussed with the needed sensativity to the subjects. God bless the Ramones and everything they stand for.
B00000K0EA|4.0|Tomorrow Never Dies, the second James Bond film to feature Pierce Brosnan as the super suave secret agent, is one of the more fun films in the long running series.  In this installment, Bond finds himself at odds with a media tycoon (Jonathan Pryce) who is attempting to jump start a world war all in the name of global domination.  It's a plot that doesn't seem too different from anything else offered in many of the previous Bond films, but the premise works thanks to some slam bang spectacular action scenes and the further development of Brosnan's interpretation of the character.  Also on board is Desperate Housewives' Teri Hatcher as one of Bond's former lovers, and Hong Kong action star Michelle Yeoh as a very letal secret agent who Bond teams up with.  Handled with exceptional flair by director Roger Spottiswoode (The 6th Day), Tomorrow Never Dies may not be the best Bond film, but it's still one of the most enjoyable.
B000028U0Y|5.0|Like I said above, this is a masterpeice, and is a testament to the fact of how Johnny Cash is the coolest man ever. Out of all the country albums I own, all of them are by Cash. I can't stand pretty much all other country. Cash is so great because he has a wider range of topics than most country singers, and unlike Garth Brooks, he's really singing with his whole heart it seems. One of those rare albums that can bring you to tears by the end. The Man In Black's memory lives one: RIP 1932 - 2003.
B00000DHRX|5.0|This is a worth while investment!<br /><br />George split this CD set into 2 parts.<br /><br />1) To listen to<br /><br />2) For the Feet.<br /><br />The For The feet CD features such foot moving songs as Outside, Fast Love and Spinning the Wheel.<br /><br />The Ballad CD features a wonderful assortment of relaxing/make out songs that really illustrate how versitile George can be.<br /><br />He has a wonderful voice like butter.
B0000AQVCL|1.0|Along with other lame bands such as the White Stripes and the Strokes, these guys give garage rock a terrible name. Various great band's riffs are ripped off by these poseurs. Just buy an Iggy Pop or AC/DC album and you shall see what I am talking about. One of the worst bands ever.
B00025ETIW|5.0|My Chemical Romance is one of those bands that is really refreshing in a world of stale music. To try and categorize this album would be a feat in and of itself. Their influences range from Punk/Emo to 80's fantasy metal to hard rock to a number of other things. This combination of styles probably wouldn't work anywhere else, but MCR have come up with a style that works and that fits them completely. Gerard's vocals are very emotional and pull you right into the songs, especially on the first track, \\"Helena,\\" and the guitar work is impressive with its solos and grooves. I recommend any rock lover to check this out. Standout tracks are: \\"Helena\\", \\"You Know What They Do To Guys Like Us In Prison\\", \\"I'm Not Okay (I Promise)\\", \\"The Ghost Of You\\", and \\"I Never Told You What I Do For A Living\\", but all of the tracks are awesome.
B000002H33|5.0|Is this thrash metal? No, not really. The songs are too constructed and long-drawn out to be considored thrash metal. Is it prog metal? More so. It's progressive metal that shows Metallica's thrash \\"Kill 'Em All\\" roots. Few albums manage to remain so consistent and magnificent as this classic rock 'n' roll album. It's really impressive that despite the long length, there is not a single boring moment on this album. The songs are both well-written lyrically and well-written musically. Only a band like Metallica could take an overused theme like insanity, and make it compelling. \\"Welcome Home (Sanitarium)\\" would be cheesy if put into the wrong hands, but Metallica manages to turn out a heartfelt song. And unlike a bunch of other metal bands interested in only partying or satanism, these guys have complex themes. War (\\"Disposible Heroes\\"), religious corruption (\\"Leper Messiah\\"), and drug addiction (\\"Master of Puppets\\") are just some of the topics touched upon. This and \\"Reign In Blood\\" by Slayer are the 80s two must buy metal albums.
1400032717|4.0|A great, quick story with believable characters and a surprise (to me, anyway) ending.  I never thought about yellow being such an obnoxious color before.  It's interesting to experience the world as seen by a child who's mind is wired differently from most.  The combination of the pragmatism of the hero and his unwitting solution to his family's problems make this story unusually simple on the outside and complex on the inside.  It was a pleasurable reading experience, not unlike \\"A Girl Named Zippy\\".   Perhaps unfairly I compare The Curious Incident to \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\".  With such a lofty benchmark, 4 stars is pretty high praise.
B000000W5L|4.0|The four stars rating is really 4.5. The albums before were great,  but this is the first Stones LP to be amazing. It takes a few listens to get into, but once you do, you'll discover its one of the greatest albums ever recorded. The mixture of country, blues, and rock is one that has yet to be topped by any band. The Stones were hyped as the world's greatest rock 'n' roll band, but its on this album they truly live up to that title. I never was much of a Stones fan until I decided to listen to this album. After that, I bought countless other LPs (I'd only had a greatest hits before). The album is bleak and weary in a way that would make Hank Williams proud. Not a single bad track on the whole thing, this is a highly reccomended purchase. In fact it's a nessescity.
1881273156|4.0|It's a fast read and most importantly, it's a fast remember. Just when I'm about to assume that my boyfriend knows how much I care about him because we are CONSTANTLY together (I'm Quality Time) I remember that he's a Words of Affirmation Guy. So all I have to do is open my mouth and SAY what I'm thinking. We even jokingly ask how each other's love tanks are. I'm happy to report that they frequently overflow. It's an amazing little lesson in daily relationship maintenence - if it is too hard to use this system, you might want to rethink the relationship and find someone who naturally complements your language.
B000002H97|2.0|Like I stated in my title, this is where everything went wrong with Metallica. The geniuses we knew and loved for \\"Master of Puppets\\" sold out, with simplier song structures, stereotypical metal lyrics, and no real drive anymore. If only Cliff didn't die, they would be in much, much better shape. It's a shame when a band that used to be so monumentally great and talented could sell out to become just another cheap rock band. And the problem is, it just got worse and worse from here on, the latest \\"Metallica\\" release being the ambyssal \\"St. Anger\\". About two decent songs are included on this album (\\"Enter Sandman\\" and \\"Wherever I May Roam\\"), and a bunch of lame ones. They really lost it with this album.
B00004T9UF|5.0|this album is the best by Em until he releases another quite like this one this album will be the best he has ever released.The 2 albums that followed the \\"Marshall Mathers LP\\" are not all that artistic.Many argue that this album is way too explicit(and kids dont be fooled by the clean or explicit version of the album,the message is still the same).Many offended by the lyrics of this album tried to push for Em to clean up the songs.The offended crowd sure know how to kill music.You can't delete lines of a song if those lines actually do justice to the song.Eminem w/o curse words is really NOT A RAP artist.This is the best album he has ever released TO DATE.i can't stand the others but this one kicks ass.
B000062YAZ|5.0|4.5 stars? Come on guys, this is a rare album that really deserves an average rating of five stars here. From the opening lighting-fast guitars and vocal wails of \\"Angel of Death\\" to the ending rain sound effects of \\"Reign In Blood\\", this is one sweet and brutally short masterpeice that never lets up for one second in it's close to half hour length. There is not a single boring moment on this record. Hey, even the critics love it (All Music gives it five stars). And unlike many of their contemporaries, Slayer never get trapped in the pitfalls of self-parody. The album never goes over-the-top, and is an experiance that will stay long with you after it ends. One of the greatest metal albums ever recorded.
0316172324|5.0|Malcolm Gladwell works in the area where he's trying to know the unknowable (at least at first glance). In \\"The Tipping Point\\" he examined how small and apparently inconsequential incidents ensure the success or failure of campaigns to influence the public. In \\"Blink,\\" he shows how, on the basis of minimal evidence, skilled people can make correct decisions.<br /><br />Since both these ideas fly in the face of common sense, he has his detractors. However, in \\"Blink\\" he has many examples where his theories hold water. Perhaps the most important is the one about military games where one team was given huge amounts of information and proceeded to work from this database. However, the team suffered heavy losses from unexpected attacks, even though they had the means in place to find traces of the the preparations of attacks. In fact, the leader of the opposing team did not behave in the way the \\"rule book\\" said he would and thus deluded the other side, even with all their knowledge.<br /><br />It is one of the things that we pride ourselves on - the ability to make correct decisions using all the evidence - yet sometimes the gut reaction is correct over the best person to hire, and sometimes also the supporting evidence turns out to be false.<br /><br />Gladwell makes it clear that this method of arriving at decisions is not necessarily true for most people or for most of the time, yet he manages to have numerous examples of, for instance, cops not shooting a suspect who appears to be reaching for a gun. What appears to be a hostile act may or may not be accompanied by other signs that make the cop more likely to believe he's in danger.<br /><br />The most fascinating chapter in the book for me - \\"Seven Seconds in the Bronx\\" - cover a police shooting of a man reaching for his wallet, but interspersed with that is the method used by Paul Ekman, who looks for fleeting facial expressions and can also teach this to others. This would be worth a book on its own, but careful examination of slow-motion film shows people revealing their feelings for a split-second at a time - the signs that experienced people look for.<br /><br />I think that \\"Blink\\" will make you never view the world in the same way again. Read it and see.careful examination of slow-motion film shows people revealing their feelings for a split-second at a time - the signs that experienced people look for. <br /> <br />I think that \\"Blink\\" will make you never view the world in the same way again.

B000002JOH|4.0|What a kick in the face! Few bands have ever managed to be as brutal and uncomprimising as Pantera. The definative thrash metal album of the 90s. When Metallica sold out, Slayer left their best material behind, and Joey Belladonna left Anthrax, these guys came along and saved metal from what seemed to be the end. While not the most consistent album ever made, tracks such as \\"The Walk\\" and \\"Mouth For War\\" show why this is regarded as a classic in the genre of thrash metal. \\"Cowboys From Hell\\" was an okay album, but this easilly beats it.
B000059H99|5.0|Even though it's understandable, given the amount of money that was involved, it's a shame they went on to make Rocky 2, 3, 4, 5 and possibly a 6th one. Those films have damaged the reputation of Rocky 1, which in my opinion is one of the greatest movies ever made, if not the greatest. And I almost never bought it because I remembered Rocky 4 and how ridiculous that story was (remember that awful speech after the final fight?). Then I saw Rocky 3 on TV one night and almost laughed at how bad the boxing scenes were.     Well, fortunately, some time later, I happened to catch a bit of Rocky 1 on cable and within moments was completely absorbed in the story. I had forgotten it completely; I hadn't seen it since I was a kid. Well, I wish I could forget it all over again (haven't you felt this way about your favorite film?). I went right out and bought the DVD and, since that day, I've must have watched this movie 100 times.     It is more a wonderful and inspiring story of the personal triumph of an American than it is a boxing movie. It is truly moving and the symbolism is all pervasive, starting with the very first image you see (that bright painting of Jesus Christ which hovers above the dark, dreary, gloomy boxing ring ). Then there are the two turtles, Cuff and Link - which symbolize Rocky and Adrienne who are two \\"slow\\" people living basically in a small fish bowl. (Rocky says at one point that he had a mountain in the fish bowl but the turtles kept falling on their backs trying to climb over it, so he had to remove it). Now to the big dark figure, Apollo Creed, in American-flag trunks and dressed as Uncle Sam. Could he be a more obvious symbol of our country - the dark, powerful side that oppresses the down trodden.    During the fight, Apollo beats on him, basically as America did to him in his 30 years (what about my prime, Mick? At least you had a prime!) In the 14th round he goes down. Adrien comes out of the back room, and he manages to get back up - an obvious symbol, it seems to me, of love lifting you from the darkest moments. That scene, together with the genius of the music, never fails to move me.    What frustrates me is when people laugh at me when I say Rocky is my favorite film. As I had, they just remember the ridiculous sequels. When I have a friend come over and they watch it, they, like me, are blown away by the power and emotion of the story.     Anyway, I recommend you forget everything you remember about the Rocky series and buy this one. You will be glad you did.
B0002X314C|5.0|This album brings me back to when music was actually good. John Legend is someone that can actually sing, entertain/perform live, and write his own lyrics which many of the so-called artists can't do these days. There are no useless filler tracks and the entire album is filled with soulful, moving ballads and songs with meaning. The only people that wouldn't like this album are ones that don't know a thing about what REAL music is, and this is real music. I wish that more artists like this would be able to come out and actually get their shine from everyone, so the ones that are ruining the music industry would go away. <br /> <br />Favorite Songs: Ordinary People, I Can Change, So High, Stay With You (And Basically Every Song On The Entire Album)
B00005JNEW|4.0|Friday Night Lights the movie was very good in portraying players like Mike Wincell, Boobie Miles, Don Billingsley; and coach Gary Gaines.  I believe the movie also portrayed the fans of the Permian Panthers execellently as die-hard, crazed football fans.  But other than those portrails, the movie failed to touch on much of the story.  The movie failed to touch on the history of Permian, as well as the future for the team.  Without all the info, this movie is basically just a bunch of kids playing football with a bit of drama on the side.  Still a pleasant story of a town and its high school football.
B0002234LS|4.0|I enjoyed this movie. I had an expectation before watching it and I can't say I was disapointed. So many times there are mystery/thriller movies that don't really deliver the goods. This movie has enough intrigue, mystery and suspense to keep most people happy. I don't want to give away the movie (what's the point, it would ruin the fun of trying to figure it out). I will though, try to give a few details without spoiling it. Mort (Johnny Depp) is a man who lives in a cabin outside of New York, newly seperated from his wife of 10 years. He is confronted by a man who claims that he plagerized his story. Mort tries to prove that it was his story, and not copied from this man named Shooter. A number of bizarre happenings begin to occur. And let's just say, there is a Stephen King twist in there. I didn't find it surprising, but I don't think you were supposed to once it happened. Overall it's a slow paced film, but worth sticking it out to see how it unfolds and resolves itself. Johnny Depp gives an excellent performance yet again.
0671042858|2.0|This book, from its cover design, its author's reputation and its blurb at the back, seems completely to suggest a tale of seething terror.<br /><br />However, I find that it is more a tale of jungle survival couched as a horror story. The horror is really very much in the background, while the reader (and protagonist) are mostly absorbed in the nitty-gritties of finding food, fighting bugs and avoiding the rocks when falling into a river.<br /><br />It is admittedly a very charming book, especially in the characterization of 9-year old Trisha McFarland and the depiction of her struggles, her ever-deepening exhaustion and that fine line between comedy and tragedy; between hope and the abyss.<br /><br />Yes there is a good build-up of fear about the \\"special thing\\" that lurks in the forest; stalking Trisha; BUT I found myself actually laughing when the terror should have climaxed. Laughing. Sure, you might choose to interpret that I am twisted, but I think the climax was more than a little funny.<br /><br />Wonderful entertainment in all, but not what I bargained for when I bought a purported horror novel!!!
B000646MNE|5.0|I've watched them over and over starting from Season 1 clear through to the end of Season 6, Part 2.  I love them all, I miss the show and since there won't be a movie, this is as good as it gets!!  A+++++++
B00005MP58|4.0|If you own the VHS version, save your money instead of \\"downgrading\\" to this DVD.  I agree with the other reviewers who point out that the DVD version is inferior.  On my television, the picture is stretched so that everything looks taller and thinner; bed curtains hardly show up at all!  I was hoping for lots of interesting extras on the DVD; what's included is disappointing.
B00006GFAB|1.0|What's with the hype about KISS? They're not that great of a band. They're just a bunch of makeup wearing queers with mediocre skills. I don't even know why these clowns are considered rock legends. There are much better bands out there from their era, such as, AC/DC and Aerosmith. AC/DC and Aerosmith were great bands who didn't wear craploads of makeup. Get your heads out of your asses and stop listening to KISS.
B00005JN2Z|4.0|Sunday, January 16, 2005 / 4 of 5 / Mann's more personal offering.<br /><br />I've enjoyed Michael Mann's work for a while going back to Miami Vice.  Manhunter was a nice step leading to his magnum opus, Heat.  Collateral, while lacking the epic scope of Heat provides a more personal one on one feel.  It's as if Mann has expanded the conversation held between DeNiro and Pacino in Heat at the diner and fleshed it out more fully in this film.  Jamie Foxx plays a cab driver who has the unfortunate pleasure of picking of Tom Cruise, a paid assassin doing the rounds for the evening.  Cruise almost makes it work for me, dressed in gray with prematurely grayed facial hair.  He's as gray as his soul.  However, too many times I almost cracked under disbelief thinking back to his numerous other `good guy' roles.  Still, Foxx made good progress throughout the movie on his journey of empowerment until the finale where of course, he must take on Cruise to save his sweetie.  A bit of a stretch to be sure, still the interplay between them and the dark streets and night of LaLa Land as a setting made the movie gripping, and ultimately memorable I think. Not Heat, but what could be.  Still, recommended.
B000268QB2|5.0|These guys really make playing the piano and drums sound cool.  You really should buy this CD.
B0002OERI0|5.0|Green Day has always been one of my favorite rock groups.Although I love the entire album, I normally only skip over the first track, which was their first single from this album.

B000268QB2|5.0|I noticed the editorial review compared this to Coldplay and Travis. I'll do this band and their singer better by comparing it to Queen and Freddie Mercury. \\"Who Wants To Live Forever\\" by Queen is a good example. Like Queen, Keane is magical and tragic but hopeful. Coldplay and Travis are British and Scottish bollocks respectively. Every song on this album is gold. Do yourself and your girlfriend a favour by buying this album or downloading it somewhere.
0425170349|2.0|Clancy fans should enjoy this counter-terrorism novel that's inspired a line of video games.  And the doomsday scenario that's the heart of the book is interesting and exciting (until the very end).  Some problems: <br /> <br />1) The terrorists are aggressively stupid.  I could take down most of Rainbow Six's bad guys with a pop gun and a half-empty packet of Kool-Aid.  The supposedly  brilliant villains are hired by a former KGB agent.  The villians then proceed to a) Lock themselves in a building, b) leave all doors and entrances unbarred, c) walk out of the buildings expecting transportation waiting for them and d) get gunned down.  You would have expected the Russian to pull one of his hires aside and say, \\"We might need to change our thinking -- locking ourselves in the bathroom hasn't sparked the revolution.\\" <br /> <br />2) The characters (save for Popov) are thin, and often serve as mouthpieces for Clancy's views on the media, the environment, military life, and the government. The main villains, in particular, talk at academic-paper length.  I thought a Brookings seminar would erupt during a few battles. <br /> <br />3) The ending is lame.  Clancy's strength has always been his action sequences, and the battles, even noting the stupidity of the terrorists, are exciting.  The doomsday scenario is great, if implausible and dependent on things working perfectly at one location in the entire world (The stock market must have affected EvilCo's travel budget).  But Clancy's heroes save the world in 100 pages of the worst payoff in his career.  I won't spoil the ending, but it's hard to spoil a climax that doesn't come off. <br /> <br />Still, if you can tune out Clancy's editorializing, and accept the stupidity of the terrorists, Rainbow Six chugs along at a decent pace.  It will help you pass time in the airport, at least.
B000002UJQ|5.0|There is nothing better than OK Computer, although The Bends has its moments and Coldplay's Parachutes is nearly flawless.  Go Radiohead.
B0002DB0FO|5.0|Everwood is the best show on T.V right now, no wonder it puts out the best box set of the year... Of the century!!!! I can't wait until second season, I just hate the fact that WB Home Video is not like 20th Century Fox, because they always told when the next season of Buffy would be released! <br /> Anyway, this IS a GREAT box set, and I recommend buying it because you won't regret it. I watched every Episode, plus the ones with commentaries I watched again!!! This is the only Box Set worth having!
B00003CXA2|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite movies.I loved the music, the script, and the characters. I normally don't like Tom Hanks but in this movie he is wonderful. I can't imagine anyone hasn't seen this movie by now, but if you haven't you need to go out and buy it immediately.
B0000039PW|5.0|Ready To Die by Notorious B.I.G. is a classic by far in the Hip-Hop genre, if not one of the greatest albums ever made in music history. The flow that the late Biggie had was incredible, his story-telling abilities were off the hook, and his lyrics were genius, purely. This album has all kinds of classic tracks, from start to finish. The production is tight, his flow and the beats blend perfectly for the whole album. Biggie is the best MC that Bad Boy records ever had, and I doubt that another artist will come out with an album this superb; it's flawless.<br /><br />The first track is just an intro. The first song is \\"Things Done Changed\\" which is excellent. The lyrics are outstanding like all the other songs on the album. The beat is also awesome. \\"Gimme The Loot\\" is many fan's favorite song, even though I can't say that for myself. However, it is still a classic. It is straight up hardcore, where Biggie is all about the money. Even though I don't think it is credited, an Onyx sample is in the chorus, off of Throw Your Guns, and a Gang Starr sample is in the song. \\"Machine Gun Funk\\" is the same ol' same ol' with Biggie; excellent lyrics over an excellent beat. \\"Warning\\" is one of my favorites off the album. Biggie gets a call about two guys who wants to kill him now that he's got money. The end of the song is funny, where the guys actually do try to rob his house. \\"Ready To Die\\" is another favorite of mine. A very hungry Biggie is on this track, very hardcore as well. Eazy Mo Bee drops another genius beat on this track. \\"One More Chance\\" is great, despite how dirty it can get. The phone calls at the beginning of the song are funny as hell. The lyrics are fantastic, even though it's a song about sex, and that mix just doesn't happen alot with all the songs coming out about sex nowadays. \\"-!-@ Me\\" skit is nasty but it is friggin' hilarious! The first time I heard it I couldn't help but laugh! It's worth a couple plays, despite being a skit. \\"The What\\" is a track that stood out to me from the start. Method Man makes an appearance, and a nice one at that. The two have great chemistry together. Eazy Mo Bee is on the beat again, and it's very laid back. \\"Juicy\\" is a nice track and single. It's all about how he came up from nothing and made something out of his life. He also pays homage to earlier rap greats in the first verse. The sampled chorus makes the song that much better. \\"Everyday Struggle\\" is another song that stuck out to me from the first listen. Biggie drops a great chorus, the beat by Norman & Digga/Bluez Brothers is fire, perfectly matching the subject matter of the song. He raps about how everyday is a struggle growing up in the ghetto and how everybody looks at you like you're a menace to society. \\"Me and My Bitch\\" is another great song, all about his favorite girl. It gets sort of tragic toward the end though. \\"Big Poppa\\" was the first song I heard from Biggie Smalls. It's also the song that really introduced me to rap music in general. So, considering this, it has to be my favorite Biggie Smalls song, and one of my favorite hip-hop songs ever. I really owe alot to it.<br /><br />The rest of the album is excellent also. (I would review the rest of the tracks but there's not much to say about a near perfect album, if not perfect). Biggie Smalls is definitly one of the best MC's of all time, with 2Pac, Rakim, Ice Cube and others I didn't mention. It was too bad he had to pass due to unneccesary violence. If he didn't, he would probably still be making great music. R.I.P. Christopher Wallace, AKA Notorious B.I.G. AKA Biggie Smalls. You're sorely missed by fans everywhere.at stood out to me from the start. Method Man makes an appearance, and a nice one at that. The two have great chemistry together.

So, considering this, it has to be my favorite Biggie Smalls song, and one of my favorite hip-hop songs ever. I really owe alot to it.  <br /> <br />The rest of the album is excellent also. (I would review the rest of the tracks but there's not much to say about a near perfect album, if not perfect). Biggie Smalls is definitly one of the best MC's of all time, with 2Pac, Rakim, Ice Cube and others I didn't mention. It was too bad he had to pass due to unneccesary violence. If he didn't, he would probably still be making great music. R.I.P. Christopher Wallace, AKA Notorious B.I.G. AKA Biggie Smalls. You're sorely missed by fans everywhere.
0064409422|5.0|Four children are transported to the kingdom of Narnia where, unbeknownst to themselves, they are the fulfillment of a prophecy that threatens the schemes of an evil witch who has locked the land in eternal winter.  CS Lewis's excellent fantasy is a retelling of the Christian story, featuring a powerful lion named Aslan as a stand-in for Jesus Christ.  Whether you are a member of the faith or just want to read a great fantasy, this is an ideal book.  Written more than 50 years ago, it is brief, efficient, and provides closure, unlike modern fantasies (many of them very fine, I admit) that go on for 900+ pages spread out over three or more volumes.  Lewis's writing style is reminiscent of \\"Mere Christianity,\\" chatty and fatherly with occasional little digressions (such as pointing out that the housekeepers will not figure much in the story) that add charm to the narrative.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I never watched Firefly while it was on the air. I never liked space TV shows, and from the way the show did in the ratings I guess a lot of people felt the same way. Boy do I wish we can all go back and watch what might have been the best show on TV at the time, FIREFLY. I could have gone the rest of my life never knowing what the show was about and never giving it the time of day, but I'm a huge movie fan and when I heard they were making a movie called Serenity, a feature lenght movie of Firefly I was surprised.    Why would a studio green light a movie of a show that had been cancelled. I soon found out that the show had developed a huge cult following and that it was more of a Sci-Fi/Western then just a cheap Star Trek or Star Wars knock off. The DVD series was released and every single review I read online was great. To this day I have yet to read a bad review. I became very interested in this so I went out to purchase the series on DVD not to long ago. It has been one of the best choices I have ever made. The show just rocks. Great writing and a great cast of vertually unknowns unless you really know your TV history.     These 14 episodes, 3 of which never aired are really not close to enough once you start watching. I don't care who you are as soon as your done watching the 2 part pilot, entitled Serenity you'll be hooked. I suggest if your a serious lover of great TV shows to go out and purchase this set and prepare yourself for September when the movie is set to be released. If the movie does well the studio already has there minds set on 2 follow up films. All of you out there that would love to see the crew of Serenity continue on go and tell your friends to not only buy one of the greatest TV shows on DVD but to get there money ready for the film.
B00005JKJA|2.0|Sorry to go against the hip popular opinion grain on these kinds of flicks, BUT, although the imagry, atmosphere, and acting, etc. are great, This movie just made my brain hurt too much while you're watching it.  <br /> <br />Trying to be cool and cutting edge are one thing but come on. Just like Blue Velvet, I kept sighing through the whole thing, wondering what the hell is going on. I hate movies that just don't give you a clue until the end, and this one didn't even do 'that' for me. I got it that one woman actress put out a hit on the other etc, etc. But I still don't know who the heck the bum behind the building with the little blue box was. Or the two guys in the resturant.  <br /> <br />Maybe if I watch it a couple more times I'll catch something I missed. But I'm not really interested enough to see it again . It made me tired and somewhat bored. (That's the problem with some movies, they make it easy to miss stuff on first viewing so you have to watch it again. Hmmm, a brilliant marketing ploy?) <br /> <br />Anyway, if it was a dream sequence and one woman putting herself in the place of the other, and fantasizing that everything was different than it really is, well I for one would have never figured it if I hadn't read some of these other reviews. What's the point? <br /> <br />I just feel you can entertain an audience without keeping completely them lost throughout the entire movie.
6304779607|3.0|This entire movie can be boiled down to:  violent cop chases crazy murderer and lots of people get shot.  Typical junk that came out of Hollywood in the 80-90's.  Fun movies to watch because of the action and neat toys, but so detached from reality they are like cartoons with real people. <br /> <br />Stallone has a really cool car that gets destroyed during the show.  Too bad, because that car was the main highlight of the movie for me. <br /> <br />He walks around with a 1911 stuffed in his pants at 12 o'clock.  Stupid way to carry a sidearm because it's in full view and is pointing at something he would probably like to keep. <br /> <br />Movies like this contributed to the negative perceptions that many people have of firearms and police.  In the real world, they don't work like in this, and those who serve the public don't act like this.    <br /> <br />Fun to watch.

B000001EL3|4.0|[...]1. Detroit Rock City: 4 out of 5  I love this song and heard it many a time. I would give it a 4.5 if they didn't have THAT STUPID LONG INTRO! The intro was pointless. When i was listening to the intro, i was thinking the song'd never come on. Just fast    2. King of The Night Time World: 5 out of 5  This is basically what KISS is all about. Good Lyrics, Catchy Guitars, and talking about being the king of darkness.    3: God Of Thunder: 3.8 out of 5  Though either way it's a good song, i like the verision with the orchestra more than the version with just the guitars.    4: Great Expectations: 4 out of 5  One of the more funny (yet true about Gene) things that KISS has made. Not really a good song (i'm as sick of KISS's slow ballads as crap), but pretty funny.    5. Flaming Youth: 3.6 out of 5  Good, but forgettable.    6: Sweet Pain: 4.5 out of 5  Good lyrics, good beat, good song.    7. Shout it Out Loud: 4.5 out of 5  Same as Sweet Pain.    8: Beth: 2.5 out of 5  Okay, Peter is a good singer, i'll give ya that much, but WHERE THE CRAP IS THE ACTION? The drums? The guitars? I'm sick of KISS's slow ballads, like i said before, but this a poor excuse for anything. On a less important note, name one person who you know who's named \\"beth\\". No offense to the Beths out there reading this, but they could've at least used a better name than Beth.    9. Do you Love Me?: 4 out of 5  Do You Love Me? gives a good recovery after a bad song like Beth. This is definatley one of the best in the album.
B00005KB9X|5.0|\\"Natty Dread,\\" was released in the aftermath of the breakup of the original Wailers in the Fall of 1973 when Bunny Wailer and Peter Tosh left to pursue solo careers.  At this point, Bob Marley had replaced Bunny and Peter with the his wife, Rita, Judy Mowatt, and Marcia Griffiths, collectively called the \\"I-Threes\\".  Also added was American rock guitarist Al Anderson, formerly with NRBQ.  With this new line-up and the release of the \\"Natty Dread\\" album in 1974, the group was no long collectively \\"the Wailers,\\" like before.  Marley had dubbed it \\"Bob Marley & the Wailers\\". <br /> <br />The album starts off with Marley's delightful \\"Lively Up Yourself,\\" (originally done with Bunny Wailer and Peter Tosh in their years with Lee \\"Scratch\\" Perry from 1969-1972).  The remake would soon be made one of the most famous songs of all-time with its delightful blues guitar and Marley's joyous singing.  Next on the list is the original cut of the legendary \\"No Woman, No Cry,\\" co-written with Vincent Ford.  Though the original version would not become as popular as the version from 1975's \\"Live!\\" it is just as good and heartfelt.  The tempo and sound are different, but this only makes the song more enjoyable. <br /> <br />Third in line is the solemn, but empowering \\"Them Belly Full (But We Hungry),\\" written by drummer Carlton Barrett and Logan Cogil.  The song's title says it all; the song sings of the evils of money and the inescapeable suffering of the poor.  Number four is one of Bob Marley & the Wailers' best known songs: \\"Rebel Music (3 O'Clock Roadblock),\\" which was actually written by Hugh Peart and bassist Aston Barrett.  The song is about Marley's harrassment by the police while in London. <br /> <br />\\"So Jah Seh,\\" written by Bob's wife, Rita, and Willy Francisco is an underrated and solemn classic about Marley's willingness and desire to spread the message of God wherever he may tread, and that God will indeed protect him.  The title track, \\"Natty Dread,\\" written by hiswife Rita and Allen Cole, is a danceable, happy tune about life in Trenchtown, and a longing to return to Africa. <br /> <br />After the title track comes a remake of \\"Bend Down Low,\\" originally from the 60's during his time with Bunny Wailer and Peter Tosh.  It's a joyous, yet serious and very realistic song about how the sinners must straighten their lives.  This song is one of the album's best with it's jovial tune and honest lyrics.  The next two tracks, \\"Talkin' Blues,\\" and \\"Revolution,\\" are my person favorites from the album. <br /> <br />\\"Talkin' Blues,\\" also written by Carlton Barrett and Lecon Cogil, is a blues-esque tune with soft, relaxing music and bold, unapologetic lyrics.  It carries Marley's message of hope, but even moreso, his will by any means nessecary to uncover lies and hypocrisy.  \\"Revolution\\" is the harder-hitting slap in the face to politicians everywhere.  Marley boldly says that the politician's goal is to see the oppression of the poor and the gain of money.  It shows Marley's aching pain that the world must be free from political strife; truly a masterpiece. <br /> <br />Finally, the bonus track \\"Am-a-Do,\\" originally released on the 1991 \\"Talkin' Blues\\" album, is a thick and delightful sensual song similar to \\"Guava Jelly,\\" or \\"Stir It Up\\".  This is one of the trademark phenominal Marley love songs. <br /> <br />Overall, Natty Dread is a simply amazing album with some of the best songs by Bob Marley & the Wailers.  No fan will be disappointed with this blues-and-jazz tinged reggae album.  It's a treasure for the musical world.
B0002OERI0|5.0|Fantastic! I am twenty six and never planned on purchasing another Green Day album. I thought those days were gone.  I am so ashamed of holding a band accountable to the fact that I listened to them when I was like sixteen. This is absolutely the best album I bought in 2004. When I listen to it on my headphones it makes me walk down the street at top speed. Buy it - bands should be rewarded for these types of efforts - this album is far from coasting on previous glory. I can't (and don't want to) listen to anything else right now.  <br /> <br />
B00006690G|4.0|THE BEST EMINEM ALBUM TO DATE!!! The Eminem Show is the most artistic piece of work he has ever put together, and is more meaningful then any of his previous work. A DEFINITE MUST HAVE.
B0001DI0FI|1.0|This movie is an insult to the intelligence of anyone who has read the books on which it claims to have been based, or who knows anything about 18th-19th century naval warfare before ironclads.
0452282152|4.0|This is not the typical book I like to read, but it was recommended to me by my mom so I gave it a shot and found that I really enjoyed it!  The heroine, Griet, is a well-developed character that you love and pity at the same time. I loved that true beauty was found in the simplicity of a servant.
0802130208|4.0|Toole crafted a train wreck of a book. Ignatius is a character that you love to hate. He is disgusting, rude, and conceded. Thank goodness there are mutliple plotlines and other characters. I say that it is a train wreck because you can not tear your eyes from it regardless of how disgusting Ignatius gets. You just have to sit back and wait for the other shoe to drop and Ignatius to get what is coming to him. Most of the other characters are pretty good, but Ignatius is the protagonits of the book so all plotlines eventually lead back to him. The book has a final twist at the ending that will leave the reader a bit frustrated. This book is definately worth reading, and it did win a pulitzer. It is a fairly quick read and is recommended for college age and above.
B000075BFK|3.0|Better Dayz is a very diverse album, it is full of filler material such as the atrocious production of Jazze Pha and pointless songs with people like Mya and Trick Daddy, but it does have its gems, songs like Thugz Mansion (both versions), Better Dayz and My Block are just some of the songs that make this 2Pac album a must have.
B0001906O0|2.0|Look, I'm going to be totally objective about this boxset. I have listened to every track on this sucker, and have come to one concrete opinion: this thing just isn't that great. <br />In fact, the one way that the Cure's four disc B-Side comp \\"Join the Dots\\" is valueable is because it shows how a band goes on a downward spiral over the course of its career. The record grows more tedious and uninspired as it progresses, much like the band itself. By the time disc three was finished, I seriously wanted to press stop, put the discs back into their respective slots and locate the nearest exit to my car to take a nice drive and listen to \\"Disintigration\\", or \\"The Head on the Door\\", or \\"Poronography\\", or... <br />The boxset begins all well and good with \\"10:15 Saturday Night\\", making its umptenth release on a Cure product, but since it is easily one of the Cure's best post-punk songs, it starts the record off well. Most of disc one follows suit, with a defiantly strong vibe, showcasing some of the Cure's best material like \\"Exploding Boy\\" or \\"Splinetered in Her Head\\". <br />Disc two starts off fairly well, chronicling the late to middle period of the Cure. The songs on this disc are decidely scizophrenic, but this makes perfect sense since the records that the songs were drawn from where different each one, from jangly pop to insular psychedlic to synth pop happiness. But you start to notice something. As the disc progresses, the songs grow more and more tired, odd since there were still some strong Cure records coming out at the time. <br />From there, ladies and gents, its all pretty much a free fall from mediocrity to bd to unlistenable(save the excellent soundtrack cut \\"Burn\\" from \\"The Crow\\", one of the best songs Smith and company ever wrote). Discs three and four are all pretty much scrap plastic, with some truly embarrassing songs on them(three versions of the Doors lousy \\"Hello I Love You\\" are here, and they actually make me, someone who hates the Doors and Jim Morrision, want to listen to the origanel in any form). The B-Sides are all, pretty much without fail, bad, and when a remix pops up from better songs(\\"Just Like Heaven\\" and \\"A Forest\\") or another needless cover(\\"World in my Eyes\\" from a Depeche Mode tribute album), the record becomes more and more grating. The last two discs are throwaway if you have a C.D. burner or \\"The Crow\\" soundtrack(you needs \\"Burn\\" bruddah). <br />The packaging is pretty good, with an informative booklet and some pretty interesting pictures that document the Cure's ever changing lineup and Robert Smiths ever expanding weist line(the last picture of him is one of the msot truly terrifying images that has been seen by I in this lifetime). <br />I know this sounds like I am being overly judgemental or hard on the Cure, and this is slightly true. I am baffled how they can from their eighties heyday to their current, a step above a drunken Cure cover band lineup. But listening to this truly questionable boxset I find it hard to think that even half these songs should be released. There is probably two discs worth of good to decent songs, but defintley not enough to fill the four discs that are here. \\"Join the Dots\\" is mediocre at best, and not needed unless you're a completist of the Cure's recorded output. <br />And if you are a completists, odds are you all ready have all these songs in some form or another. <br />Pretty worthless.
B0002Y4T92|1.0|I bought two copies of this from the Eric Clapton website (shipped from Warner Home Video). Both copies were bad on disc 2 starting at about chapter 20. I rented a copy from Netflix and got the same thing. It would be a wonderful disc set to purchase if it weren't flawed from the factory. Warner Home Video would not replace or refund since I had made my purchase over 30 days ago. Tell me how to buy in time for Christmas and then know within 30 days if the DVD is defective. I love Eric Clapton but his wonderful name was used to rip me off.
B00004RF9B|1.0|I ordered the movie Forbidden Planet (NEW) through Amazon.com, when I received the DVD the disk inside was not the DVD I ordered, isted, the titled DVD that was in the factory sealed Forbidden Planet pakage, was \\"THREE TO TANGO\\", I cannot find a proceedure or a method to resolve this situation on the amazon.com web site. I am out $14.99, and I still do not have a copy of Forbidden Planet. My sudgestion, is do not buy this DVD online anywhere, but rather, buy it from a local store, where you can take it back, if you are unlucky enough to get stuck like I did.

B0000CAXID|4.0|This cd is awesome, its the only one ive heard from the foo fighters. The reason i picked up this album is because dave grohl is from nirvana, which most ofyou should know, and i think hes a sick drumer, hes very talented, saying he does the guitar, bass, drums and vocals for this album. I havnt had the chance to listen to any other album, but i will some time. <br /> <br />5 STARS!
B00013RC9I|4.0|A very solid effort with very little in the way of filler. <br />For some weird reason this album reminds me of 10cc fast forward to 2005. There are hooks throughout but it's not a pop album per say. <br />There's an underling tension that draws you back from the hooks and  <br />herein lies the secret and the genius of this album. Maybe it's cultural, maybe it's devised, but whatever the reason, it works. If you can get past your first impression of Walkie Talkie and move past any preconcieved notions of Air, this album has a whole lot to offer. Enjoy!
B00004T9UF|4.0|GREAT MUSIC!!! The Marshall Mathers LP is just plain and simple great music. Remember Me is classic hip hop with two of the most underrated emcees in the game RBX & Sticky Fingaz. A MUST HAVE.

I think, and <br />hope you agree, that Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clarke make a great, suitable couple. <br /> <br />Clever Stuff BBC!
B00000055E|3.0|R U Still Down is one of the best after life 2Pac albums that anyone has put together. It is a hard listener but the overall talent that he must have put into making that much material before he died deserves enough respect, but overall R U Still Down is a must have.
6304779607|2.0|There really is not any redeeming factors in the movie. The acting is simple terrible! The story is only average but it is poorly told. Like many bad movies the only thing it is worth watching for is a good laugh. <br /> <br />If you like Stallone stay away you will be terribly disappionted.  Sly as many movies that are leaps and bonds better than this thing.
B00005JN4F|5.0|This is a fabulous movie!! Queen Latifah is a star! She shines!! <br />I love Queen Latifah more than anything and I have seen every movie that she has ever been in and this one is my favorite. I saw this movie 8 times!! She has great chemistry with Jimmy Fallon. When they were on Saturday Night Live together in 2002 they clicked!! They have about an hour and a half of outakes!! They are so funny!! Go to the bathroom before you see this movie because you are sure to pee in your pants from laughing so much!!

0064407667|4.0|Having read 11 books in this series with my son, my remarks will apply more to the series in general than to this book in particular.    I was struck with the thought today that this Series -- an extended serial novel, really -- is rather like the old movie (or early TV) adventure serials.  Every week, the hero managed to outwit the villain and escape, and every week the villain also somehow managed to escape justice to fight another day.  \\"Tune in next week, when...\\"  Is this formulaic?  Absolutely!  But people \\"tuned in\\" week after week to be entertained by their heroes nonetheless, and Lemony Snicket seems to be selling books with no letup in sight.    In the case of these books, the heroes are three young children who, each with their own particular talent, face an ongoing series of, well, of Unfortunate Events, not the least of which is the first one: Being simultaneously orphaned and made homeless by a fire.  As they carry bravely on, we learn several valuable lessons from the young Baudelaires:      * There is nothing wrong with doing what you do well, and one talent is not necessarily \\"better\\" than another -- they are all useful at different times   * Combining different people's abilities by teamwork multiplies their value   * People (i.e. adults) often mean well, but they don't always miraculously save the day, because they have their own worries and their own faults   * Life is not always fair.  Hardly ever, in fact   * Your family and your friends are your most important possessions    Part of the humor and appeal of these books is that they are not just somewhat morbid, they unashamedly and self-deprecatingly wallow in it to the point of being parodies of tragedy.  But, kids seem to like that sort of thing. Ghost stories around the campfire, monster stories, dinosaurs.  There is something entertaining (and maybe, in a paradoxical way, even reassuring) about contemplating the darker and scarier side of life within the comfort and safety of your own homeand family.  Adults are not immune to this either, as we can see from the popularity of Stephen King.    These books contain a series of running gags which function on several levels, such as the narrator's often cockeyed, occasionally helpful definitions of words and phrases, and Sunny's (the youngest orphan) \\"baby talk\\", which often contains subtle puns that adults might catch, while completely going over the heads of younger readers.  Also, on the fan web sites for the books you can find literally hundreds of listings of literary and historical allusions hidden in the place and character names.  (Just to cite one example, the names \\"Klaus\\" and \\"Sunny\\" once famously ended in \\"VonBulow\\", decades before they got their new association with \\"Baudelaire.\\")  One is reminded of the classic Warner Brothers cartoons, which were entertaining for kids, but also had plenty of gags aimed at the parents in the audience.    The villians, including and especially the ridiculous arch-villain Count Olaf, are also rather cartoonish, and so is the action.  The action, both good and bad, is not much more gruesome than The Addams Family, nor more violent than a Roadrunner cartoon, and just about equally believable.  (If you, or your children, actually BELIEVE that a coyote will remain suspended in midair for several seconds after the ground falls out from underneath him, or, getting back to the books, that a young baby can climb up an elevator shaft with her teeth, then you might want to consider reading something else. You might also consider getting professional help. [grin])  But a little of this kind of unreality helps make fiction entertaining, and for younger readers, it helps to separate fantasy from reality.  The main difference between the books and Saturday morning cartoons is that, when people die, they stay that way.  And it makes their friends and family very sad, but most other people don't care all that much.  This, too, is a lesson about the world we live in.    To saythat the books are \\"all the same\\" because they all are derived from the same basic formula is not entirely accurate.  Again in the tradition of a serial mystery novel or adventure show, as the books progress, we learn little snippets about the grand conspiracy that seems to underlie these Unfortunate Events.  Throwaway facts and events from earlier books come back and take on new meanings.  And the characters DO grow and develop slowly from book to book.  Klaus celebrates his birthday, Sunny learns to walk, and her unique speech more and more resembles actual English.  (And eventually -- I am going to try not to give away too much here -- given the choice between going back yet again to their hopelessly inept guardian, Mr. Poe, or throwing in their lot with their new friends, the three Baudelaires might just decide that the time has come to try something different.)    One nice thing about the way the books are constructed is that each book has some feeling of \\"ending\\".  That is, whatever current episode the Baudelaires are facing has some resolution, though their overall adventure continues, and there is some lead-in to the next book to whet your appetite.  This is I think a good compromise for younger readers, who might find more drastic cliffhangers between books unbearable. (The biggest exception is between books 9 and 10; that IS a cliffhanger, almost literally!)    So, again like a suspenseful TV series, if you get hooked on one episode, you'll probably keep coming back for more and more; but if you don't like the first one, you probably won't ever bother watching again.  Fortunately, the books in the Series of Events can be bought individually if you want, and by today's hardcover standards are pretty reasonably priced, so trying out the first one or two is a pretty small risk should it turn out not to be your cup of tea.  For my part, my 11-year-old son and I can't wait to get our hands on each next book.  The series is projected to be 13 books of 13 chapters each. As of Book The Eleventh, Mr. Snicket has so many loose plot threads flying in the air, tying them all up neatly will be a thrilling tour-de-force.  I can't imagine how it is all going to end, but, as the narrator has already warned us, we know that ending is not likely to be a happy one!
B0000029GA|3.0|HIP HOP CLASSIC!!! Don't get me wrong Illmatic is a classic album but I take in account of what music is to me now. Illmatic was the first of it's kind and if you listen to rap and you don't have this album you should burn your whole collection. MUST HAVE.
B00006CXSS|5.0|These 10 episodes give you a sense of what it was really like to be there.  Saving Private Ryan was a great start but Band of Brothers is able to go well beyond since it is spread over 10 episodes.  Well worth the time to sit down and watch all of them.
B00005AQGH|3.0|This is my favorite 2Pac album, although it's not the best. The raw hip hop emotion that he shows on this album is just to hard to describe. Makaveli is just full of classic material like Hail Mary, To Live & Die In L.A., Against All Odds and Bomb First. This is a definite MUST have.
B00066N8JS|5.0|I bought this album a week or two ago before I even owned a SACD player.  I already had the original release of The Downward Spiral. I enjoyed listening to both discs, so much so that I went and bought an SACD player and some monster cables to hook up all 6 channels.  I turned off all of the processing the SACD player and my receiver are capable of doing--I wanted to listen to it exactly as it was recorded on the disc: 6 channel direct as it's called.  I pressed [play].  The hair on the back of my neck stood up.  The sound is horrifying and beautiful, abusive and intimate.  When Reznor screams, you can hear the spit hitting the microphone.<br /><br />Suffice it to say that I'm pleased with my purchase, for both the album and SACD player.  I would say that this album is not for the faint of heart, but perhaps it is.  I think Renzor felt most vulnerable at the time when this was recorded, and it makes the listening experience all the more engulfing if the listener allows themselves to be vulnerable, too.  In summary, it's worth the money.  It's worth the money if you already own the original '90s release.  Bravo.
B00003CXDV|5.0|It's difficult to add to what's been said already by so many (save that those reviewers who can't appreciate how the movie pokes fun at the Star Trek genre probably can't laugh at themselves either).<br /><br />I can say this much: For a \\"Trekker\\" (a rational fan) like myself, this movie is pure genius and pure joy. Yes, it has a few plot holes big enough to drive a D'deridex-class Romulan Warbird through. But the scriptwriting overall is excellent, the cast-typing first-rate, the special effects top-notch (not least those necessary to transform Sigourney Weaver into Gwen DeMarco), the acting worthy of the technical expertise and vice versa, and the respect for the phenomenon of Trekkie fandom genuine. Perhaps best of all, the DVD has extra features that add much to the product without being overwhelming (like those endless director comments in some of the Star Trek DVDs). It makes me wish that someone really would start up a Galaxy Quest TV series with all the original cast and the elements of parody firmly intact -- and put it on the Sci-Fi Channel, if necessary.
B000055Y0X|3.0|Despite Peter Sellers in three roles this is all pretty laugh-free as a comedy. Great sets, good dialogue (interesting but not humourous at all). I never heard that Pickens thought he was in a drama all the time he was filming. Doubtul when he's filming the sequeance when he's on the bomb falling out of the plane he still thought he was in a drama.
B00008O0WN|4.0|Unless science fiction is very, very \\"hard\\" -- and sometimes even then -- there are always elements of fantasy involved, especially when it's presented onscreen. Whether on television or on the silver screen, Star Trek (ostensibly a science fiction series) has never been shy about using however much or little fantasy is required to make its point. The show has always been first and last a humanist morality play, a myth for modern times, and to critique it solely from the point of view of hard science misses the point.<br /><br />That said, I liked this DVD even better than a DVD I saw first, Spider-Man 2 (likewise a morality play in the best Marvel Comics tradition) -- which is saying a great deal. Many have already commented on the plot of ST: Nemesis, so I need say no more here. But for me, at least, the Star Trek universe is more \\"realistic\\" than that of Peter Parker, even though he lives and moves (so splendidly!) in modern New York. I think it's because the humans and aliens in this film are not superpowered; it's their machines as extensions of (yet as separate from) themselves that have tremendous capacities for good or evil. Moreover, Picard and his nemesis Shinzon (thanks to the respective technologies at their service) are not nearly so equally matched as Spider-Man and Dr. Octopus apparently are. \\"Doc Ock\\", those mighty mechanical arms notwithstanding, has a human part vulnerable to Spider-Man's superior fleshly strength. Shinzon's Scimitar is a \\"predator\\" that eats Federation starships and Romulan Warbirds (not to overlook planets like Earth) for breakfast. Only great skill, character and sacrifice on the part of Picard and Data in particular can overcome Shinzon's advantages. If anything, I think that Spider-Man's dictum \\"with great power comes great responsibility\\" is even more one of the themes of ST: Nemesis than of Spider-Man 2 -- even if that theme is not one of the overt aims of the first film.<br /><br />And now, let's hope that the next film in this series breaks the pattern of odd-numbered Trek films being of lesser quality...in this series breaks the pattern of odd-numbered Trek films being of lesser quality...
B00005JNBQ|5.0|This movie is for only one kind of person, and that person has to be in the right mood for this at the time.  The movie is sooo stupid, that it's actually funny!  It's the kind of movie that you watch when you're looking for something to make fun of or something to make you laugh.  It's the kind of stupid humor that you should watch with a friend.  This movie is definitely not for you boring people.
B00014NE62|5.0|To those who inquired if the DVD has subtitles - yes, it has English subtitles.  However they are hard to find.  They aren't listed as an option on the menu - but you can turn them on using the subtitle button on your DVD remote control.<br /><br />This is the best movie depiction of the psychological journey of a gay person's accepting his or her true nature.  I want to defend the ending of the movie and book to those who say it's unrealistic (don't read the rest of this review if you haven't seen it!)<br /><br />Forster himself said in the afterward to the novel that he partially based the final relationship of Alec and Maurice on a gay couple he knew who had been together for many years in Edwardian England - so two men staying together was not unheard of at the time.  Those who say that Maurice and Alec could not stay together because of their social class differences are guilty of the same classism that Forster was speaking out against.  Alec was obviously very intelligent despite his lack of education.  Maurice could provide some education to Alec to expand his knowledge (as was hinted at in the British Museum sequence).  There were certainly things that Maurice could learn from Alec - for example \\"not letting your head go under when swimming\\" - a metaphor for Alec's more comfortable expression of his sexual feelings.<br /><br />I love the new cover photo for this edition.  Kudos to the filmmakers and actors, and those who put this excellent DVD package together!
B00063MBU8|1.0|No one should waste their time listening to this trash.  They have to be one of the worst rock/pop bands ever.  This music is gay and I recommend listening to pretty much any other musican.  Simple Plan almost makes Ashley Simpson look like a pretty good singer.
B000069AUI|5.0|A Rush of Blood to the Head is Coldplay's second album and is one of the best rock albums released this decade. While their previous album Parachutes was a more somber affair, A Rush Of Blood To The Head shows many mood swings and changes in styles. Chris Martin's poetic lyrics and emotional vocals continue to shine as well resulting in a great album that becomes more rewarding with each listen.<br /><br />Every track here is top notch. The opener \\"Politik\\" bounces between subdued during the verses and loud grungy guitar during its choruses. \\"In My Place\\" is an excellent ballad which features a memorable hook with its simple guitar melody. The tracks \\"God Put A Smile Upon Your Face\\" and the title song are moody tracks which build in momentum before returning to their original quiet beginnings. \\"Green Eyes\\" is a great country love song you can envision someone playing while a bunch of friends are huddled around a campfire. \\"Daylight\\" flirts with psychedelia while the driving power chords of \\"A Whisper\\" add to the everchanging mood of the album. The songs \\"Warning Sign\\" and the piano ballads \\"The Scientist\\" and \\"Amsterdam\\" are beautiful love letters put to music sung very passionately by Martin.  Finally, the hit single \\"Clocks\\" is arguably the best song here featuring a memorable piano hook and melody. A spectacular album, very impressive considering this is only their second release. Highly recommended.
0380799006|5.0|This is a really good book.  I especially like the point about not getting caught up in treating kids equally but rather individually.  They do not want to hear that you love them as much as you love their siblings.  They want to know that they are special.  As a Mom of twins, it is especially easy for me to fall into that trap and worry constantly about fairness and equality rather than their individuality. e.g. \\"I love you as Suzie, and you're my only Suzie.\\" instead of \\"I love you as much as your sister Janie.\\" <br /> <br />I don't normally read this type of book and I don't often give 5*s but this one deserves it! <br /> <br />Small portions of the book were a little dry but all in all I found it hard to put down.  The only small thing I disagreed with was the advice at one point to use a doll to act out anger.  This, however, was a minor point and was not at all typical of this excellent book.
B000002H97|4.0|this album is number 5 from metallica, the fifth made and the fifth best. enter sandman and nothing else matters are the best songs on here, end of argument. all of these songs have great solos, but they dont have the other parts of a song to make them all great. sure, I'm excited to hear any of these songs on the radio, because there is barely any good metal on anymore. it may be pretty good within itself, but dont call it metallica's best, because it isn't. it never was and never will be. any of the first four metallica albums beat it easily. metallica never truly sold out or went \\"mainstream\\". those are just stupid labels people give to bands they dont truly care about. it's still good music, but it isn't great music, especially compared to the rest of metallica's first 5 albums. i read a magazine article recently with the \\"top ten metallica songs to make your life better\\" and half of those were from this album. wherever i may roam is pretty good but whiplash or disposable heroes, my least favorite songs from the first four albums, easily beat that. all of you who seriously think that this is the best metallica album or has the best metallica songs, you disgust me. the only songs that deserve to be on that top ten list are enter sandman and nothing else matters. heres a much more accurate top ten for you (in no particular order): master of puppets, ride the lightning, one, fade to black, enter sandman, nothing else matters, (the last 4 are up to you, if you have good metallica judgement) blackened,  seek and destroy, sanitarium, battery. sure im listening to the cd right now and it sounds pretty damn good...but i still hear the flaws in it, how it will never compare to master of puppets, ride the lightning, ...and justice for all, and kill 'em all. sure, i have a huge scratch on my cd on enter sandman, but i know that song and love it. nothing else matters is the high middle point of this album. after the good fast songs dont tread on me and throught the never comes this soft perfectly played song. its like tranquil still water in the middle of a great storm in the ocean. but soon it lets out all its emotion in its great solo, not unbelievable or unplayable, but just great and classic and emotional and perfect. as you can see, i enjoy this part of the ablbum very much. but its perfection is scarred by of wolf and man, the god that failed, and my friend of misery. but it ends well on the awesome song the struggle within. its got great riffs and solo, plus its cool with its vocals and lyrics. its a damn good album, but by no means the essential metallica album or the high point of their career. cliff burton left this world and metallica at their prime, leaving them with the great ...and justice for all, and then downhill from there. how much longer can i go trying to make my point? here's the bottom line: metallica is a good album but fifth among metallica albums. I hope all of you who think this album is the best learn something from what I've said, but let the music speak to you the way it will. metallica is the best band ever. enjoy. <br />R.I.P. cliff burton
0792165020|4.0|Slow start. bit a great movie. <br /> <br />Damon and Law make a great combo.
B0002OERI0|5.0|This album it the bomb.  GreenDay is the best Rock band out today, especially considering that they have true tallent, unlike alot of other wanna be rock bands (good charlott, simple plan, switch foot).  It shouldn't be parental advisory, they only say F*** a few times, and thats pretty much it.  All in all this album is INSANE!!
0393320928|5.0|I like this book a little better than \\"SYJ\\"--I certainly do also like \\"SYJ\\". However, the best thing I like about Feynman is that he talked so honestly about himself. Hardly any other celebrity would want do that. In \\"SYJ\\", he is real, not afraid to talk about his adventures or even sex. But you still can tell that in that book he was like a naughty boy, sometimes deliberately created \\"troubles\\" and generated adventures. In this book, he became more genuine, he used a very sincere voice to focus on how he see and value things -- love (2nd chap.), life, science (last chap.)... It almost make me have a crush on him - although he is dead. What do I care what you think about my last remark? :)
B0000AFX64|3.0|Diehard fans of \\"Battlestar Galactica\\" fondly remember the 1970s TV show, which was Glen Larson's attempt to bring a \\"Star Wars\\" style space opera to TV. Whereas George Lucas combined Flash Gordon, classical mythology, Zen Buddhism, 1940s war movies and a wealth of other influences to create his films, Larson was less successful. Lorne Greene, who played Commander Adama on the series, was best known as the patriarch of TV Westerns, which along with some very conservative politics, reveals Larson's true inspiration. This doesn't make the series bad, but its very concept guarantees that it wouldn't be as flashy as its rivals. For those totally unfamiliar with the series, \\"Battlestar Galactica\\" deals largely with the futuristic aftermath of a nearly successful attempt by a race of robots called Cylons to exterminate the human race. <br /> <br />This basic DVD contains the feature film version of \\"Battlestar\\" which was edited together from the first few episodes and shown in Europe as a way to recoup some of the money spent on the highly budgeted TV series. The special effects are impressive for their time, though not of \\"Star Wars\\" quality, and the costumes and creature design are quite good in a 1970s way and not as embarassing as the later \\"Buck Rogers\\" TV show. Ironically, if you listen to trance or techno music, the Cylons' synthetic voices (courtesy of a Vocoder) haven't aged at all! <br /> <br />If you're a diehard fan, you'll want the whole series, which died a very quick death in 1978. For a casual fan like myself, this DVD contains all the \\"Battlestar\\" you'll want to see.
B000001DTM|3.0|I was a major fan U2 until this album. I loved \\"Boy\\",\\"October\\". \\"Joshua Tree\\" and \\"Under a Blood Red Sky\\", and most of the others broke new ground when they tried and even when they didn't. They always had more obvious flaws than any major group of it's day, but so what,the Stones did too, in their early days. When I first heard \\"Actung Baby\\" on the day of it's release, my first impression was that U2 had  made the same mistake the Rolling Stones did with \\"Satanic Majesties Request\\" in 1967. That is, arts up pretty good songs with ill-informed (at best) production concepts that seemed to throw everything but the kitchen sink-except what they actually were good at,in an oddly desperate effort to sound ahead of a trend that was old much earlier(I though perhaps Bono had been trapped in an elevator with someone who knew just how to \\"fix\\" U2 and his ears filled it with nonsnse about how how to make U2 RELEVANT AGAIN! or whatever and for some reason, listened to the idiot! But instead of making a one album mistake,like the Stones, who came back with \\"Beggars Banquet\\", U2 turned it into a whole era which caught on AGAIN!(Imagine if psychedelia circa 1967 had become big again and dominated the early-to-mid 70's?) Given the few bits I've heard of the newest album, this period may thankfuly be coming to an end, but when an band this popular goes off the rails so badly, they might never find their way back. As an ex-fan, I hope they can do it. If they can't, maybe it's time to hang it up. The are far lesser bands in rock history that gave it up for lesser reason than what this album started.
B000000H5K|5.0|Sepultura's album Chaos A.D. established the band as more than just another thrash metal outfit, Roots expands both its search for identity and its quest for sheer aural destruction. Being one of the big influences on all Nu-Metal bands, sepultura would release an album that would inspire future nu-metal bands like mudvayne and slipknot. The tribal sounds and the crushing guitars and the slower paced songs are signs of change for the band. Frontman Max Cavalera explores his past in \\"Roots, Bloody Roots\\" and \\"Endangered Species,\\" and plays with a remote Brazilian tribe on \\"Rattamahatta\\". Sepultura had steadily established themselves as Brazil's premier metal outfit, but it wasn't until 1991's breakthrough album Arise that they truly captured hearts and minds. Years later they have continued to progress and while this isn't their best record it is a must have for fans of thrash metal, nu-metal, and sepultura fans alike.
B0000028RR|5.0|This is a brutal CD! My mom bought this for me, and I am glad. Each track is so intense that I ask, \\"Is this alternative?\\"<br /><br />What I think of each track:<br /><br />1. \\"Bombtrack\\" - Love this track, since it has the catch phrase \\"Burn, burn, yes you're gonna burn!\\".<br /><br />2. \\"Killing In The Name\\" - The radio single. The guitars are crushing, but the lyrics are repetitive.<br /><br />3. \\"Take The Power Back\\" - Love the bass on the track. It sounds a lot like the bass track for the \\"Seinfeld\\" theme.<br /><br />4. \\"Settle For Nothing\\" - A deeper track. Mellow at first, but explodes in your ears like a stick of dynamite.<br /><br />5. \\"Bullet In The Head\\" - Good bass, but it sounds like they covered a rap song.<br /><br />6. \\"Know Your Enemy\\" - This is more hardcore than alternative. Perfect for fans of Shelter and Earth Crisis.<br /><br />7. \\"Wake Up\\" - Wakes me up. This could have been a hit single easily, with the rememberable riffs and such.<br /><br />8. \\"Fistful Of Steel\\" - Consists of the brutality of Helmet. Possibly one of my favorites on this album.<br /><br />9. \\"Township Rebellion\\" - A mix of rap, metal, and hardcore. Still a brutal track with the catch phrase \\"fight the war, f**k the norm\\", as said in \\"Know Your Enemy\\".<br /><br />10. \\"Freedom\\" - This track has one of the most memorable bass lines of the whole album. It's worth a listen.<br /><br />Buy this album. It's inexpensive, brutal, and it actually consists of talented musicians. \\"Evil Empire\\" is a good listen, but \\"The Battle of Los Angeles\\" is mediocre. This is an essential for any rock fan, even the hardcore audience.
0679879269|5.0|First off... this ain't no Harry Potter. While Harry Potter is excellent, thiese books are mor thought provoking and intelligent. Sorry to all the die-hard Potter fans out there for saying that. Now, about the way it's written. Phillip Pullman has a gift for describing epic battle scenes that can give Tolkien a run for his money. You could even go so far as to say that the heavenly war at the end compares favorably to the battle of the Pellenor Fields in LOTR, which is definitely saying something. Also, Pullman gives us the rare ability to pity, hate, and love some of the characters. Lord Asriel, Lyra's dominatining father is one of these.  <br /> <br />Regarding the content itself, well, let's just say that we won't be demanding any new cover anytime soon. Call me crazy, but for some odd reason I really dislike dust-jackets, and with a book such as this, with a picture on the actual book, I just trash the dust-jacket. In this case it has a positive effect. You don't see the title, just the full erie splendor of the front cover, showing the land of the dead, with Will and Lyra as the only bright things in that utterly dismal wasteland. And you can just make out the faces of the dead, a pretty macabare vision, if I say so myself. Nice thick paper, wierd symbols on the edge of the pages, and a nice mystical font on the chapter names. No problem there. <br /> <br />Onto the long-expected plot summary: The book opens with Lyra.... wo is being drugged by her mother in a small cave in her world. Now a neighborhood girl named Ama finds out what Mrs. Coulter is doing and plans to help the girl escape. Meanwhile, right after the death of his father, Will, along with two angels, Baruch and Balathamos, has gone looking for the missing Lyra. In another plot line, the scientist Mary Malone has gone into another world and meets strange wheeled creatures called mulefa. All of them meet and together, their destiny changes all the worlds. <br /> <br />Ths book will make you laught,cry, and generally leave you in awe of how utterly amazing this book is. <br /> <br />Final grade- \\"A+\\"  <br /> <br />Adieu
0385510454|5.0|John Grisham tells another great story. The scenes in Bologna made me want to travel to Italy. Prepare to be sitting on the edge of your seat right to the very end. Grisham has a grasp on the big geo-political picture and he's not afraid to pose big moral questions. THE BROKER - attorney Joel Blackman is a man forced to face the consequences of his actions. A great read.
B00005T30L|5.0|Never heard about this one, but ended up glued right through to its end. Great find! A dark comedy about a teenager's frustration with setting out on the road to self-discovery and coming to a dead end.<br /><br />The dialogue is nimble, the music apt, and the screenplay a refreshing change from the pat assembly-line teenybop flicks cranked out several times a year by Hollywood. The plot is peripheral, it's the characters and a fluid narrative that take center-stage.<br /><br />As delightfully droll but cynical 17 year-olds facing the first challenges of adulthood -- leaving home, getting a job, finding a love life -- the two female protagonists do a fabulous job of coming across as outsiders among their peers never quite trying to \\"fit in\\".<br /><br />In what begins as a harmless goof, one of them finds herself drawn to schleppy forty-something Seymour (Buscemi), a regular Joe and collector of 78rpm records. You know Buscemi from character roles in a bunch of popular movies, including Reservoir Dogs; all pent-up cynicism and inherent geekiness, he couldn't be more perfect in this role.<br /><br />Thrown in are other interesting caricatures of some pretty credible small town characters, notably an art teacher who got more inane with every highfalutin bit of art she expounded on high school kids.<br /><br />Thankfully, the movie resists the temptation of convenient closures so some may take issue with how it all turns out for the teenage girl and the middle age geek. But it feels more real this way.<br /><br />What a marvellously done film. Rent it pronto, even the credits are worth it.
B0000CFW87|2.0|Sure, he's miles ahead of the devoid Clay Aiken [who or what isn't?], but I still prefer `You Raise Me Up' when it was recorded as `Wind Beneath My Wings' and I didn't like it much then either.  Bland quasi-classical in the same vein as Charlotte Church, his pro-nun-ci-a-tion more suited for the Broadway stage, stabs `Hymne a l'Amour' to stupefaction, misguidedly co-writes a few himself, and gets lost when he decides to get ambient.  Groban seems intense in his beliefs, and credit him for not pandering, but, while he seems to love the sound of his own voice, the delivery remains soporific.  My grade: C+
B00005V1Y0|5.0|Up-and-coming dance sensation Scott Hastings doesn't notice the nerd, Fran (could there be any blander name?). But when his uninventive peers won't let him do things his maverick way, he gives her another look. She believes in him, and soon he learns how blind they've all been. Not an altogether original storyline? Well, okay, it isn't.  <br /> <br />But through the eyes of Baz Luhrmann, the most ordinary tale can be turned on its ear. The filming is wonderful, vivid, sumptuous. The characters are hardly real, but instead tongue-in-cheek characatures of ballroom dancing society. Its like watching a circus, a bit like \\"Moulin Rouge,\\" but with a more quirky, dry sense of humor that is unique to the Australians. Paul Mercurio may not be the best actor, but his dancing is divine, Tara Morice is a wonderfully endearing nerd, and Barry Otto as Scott's father is perfectly wonderful. I laughed so hard I cried. I smiled so hard, my face hurt.  <br /> <br />Not only is this the best dance movie I've ever seen, it's among my favorites for quirky, off-beat comedies and feel-good love-stories.
B00006AW2J|5.0|This is an amazing cd and one of the best ever made.  Of course we are talking about the beginning of the Stones' golden period here.  Beggars, its follow-up Let it Be, Sticky Fingers, and Exile on Main St. are all five-star albums and easily some of the best rock n' roll ever made.  Beggars is second only to Exile, which in my opinion is the greatest rock album ever made, hands down.  It's also my favorite cd.  Beggars comes close though.  Kickin' off with Sympathy for the Devil, which has a stinging guitar solo from Keith Richards and really isn't that sacriligious (as most people claim).  It's actually a good example of Mick Jagger's intelligence, something which he hid quite well.  It goes into one of the prettiest songs they ever cut, No Expectations.  I love the slide guitar on it.  Some other good songs off this cd are the seminal Street Fighting Man and Stray Cat Blues (which foreshadows the route into sleaze the Stones would take later).  Prodigal Son is a great blues cover (one of the many they did) and Factory Girl is just amazing.  \\"Appalachian\\" with an African drum beat.  Then it ends with one of the greatest closing songs ever, Salt of the Earth (it ranks only behind You Can't Always Get What You Want in the Stones catalogue).  Beggars is a sort of bridge between their earlier and later material.  Excellent cd...
0140143505|5.0|This book is a collection of letters; mainly correspondence between Hanff and her London book seller, Frank Doel.  The letters are witty and filled with literary reference that is sure to make any true reader fall in love with both Hanff and Doel.  The imagery of New York and London, too, are there if you're looking for it. <br /> <br />I'd recommend reading 84 Charing Cross Road and Q's legacy as the two are intertwined in Hanff's life.
0553582445|5.0|This is the first book in The Tawny Man trilogy (before The Golden Fool, and Fool's Fate).<br />Fool's Errand takes place fifteen years after the events of the Red Ship Wars. Fitz, who goes by the name of Tom Badgerlock, now lives a quiet life in a remote cottage by the woods with his wolf Nighteyes and his foster son Hap, a mismatched-eyed boy brought to him years ago by Startling.<br />The Minstrel's visits are the only regular ones he gets, bringing him comfort but also news from the world around. The only other people he ever sees are the casual travellers stopping for shelter, such as Jinna, a hedge-witch Hap once met when Starling took him to Buckkeep for Springfest.<br />But all of a sudden his former life comes knocking at the door, when one day the visitor turns out to be Chade. Fitz's old secret mentor, now the queen's counsellor, asks Fitz to return to Buckkeep to teach the Skill to Prince Dutiful, Queen Kettricken's son and heir to the Farseer throne, and to Nettle, his own daughter, whom he's never met. But at first, although well-knowing he's the only remaining person trained in the Skill, Fitz refuses to go.<br />Weeks go by, and during that time Hap, a teenager now, says he wants to find an apprenticeship. Of course Fitz wants the best master for him, but ashamedly realizes he hasn't put any money aside for this day. Hap has no choice but to leave and find jobs to pay for his apprenticeship.<br />And while Hap's gone, Fitz gets another unexpected visitor: the Fool, whose colour has changed to a tawny gold, is now a very well-respected, if a tad excentric Jamaillian nobleman known in Buckkeep as Lord Golden. All summer they make up for lost time by talking about their youth together and about what happened in their lives since they parted fifteen years ago. Slowly Fitz picks up thread of his old life.<br />Until Hap returns, empty-handed. But soon Fitz has news from Buckkeep: Chade is calling for help, as Dutiful has gone missing. Was the prince kidnapped by the Piebalds, a group of Witted rebels claiming that the Prince also has the Wit? Indeed, despite Kettricken's new laws, people with this magic are still being persecuted and murdered. Or did the solitary, introvert boy just run away from court duty? The prince's bethrotal with an Outislander Narcheska, to secure peace treaties, is in two-weeks' time. Something has to be done, quick. Reluctantly, but also seeing this as a good opportunity to ask Chade to help Hap in return, Fitz finally agrees to go. He sets off with the Fool, Nighteyes, and Laurel, the queen's hunstwoman and confidente.<br />It's weird. I think in the beginning I got the same feeling of disappointment I get each time I've been expecting something for a very long time. It can be a book, a film, or my favourite band's new album. You expect the new thing to be exactly the same as the old one, but it's not. Of course it can't be. So I was finding the story was a bit too slow, and that Fitz was worrying too much about his wolf's mortality. Moreover, I was travelling and sadly could only read Fool's Errand periodically, which made me think I was losing interest inbetween reading sessions. But the truth is, each time I picked it up again, it wasn't long before I was hooked, living the story as if I was part of it. So I grew even fonder of the Fool, or was sometimes shocked by Fitz's violent reactions, etc. In the end I realize my favourite author hasn't let me down, and this sure is one of my favourite books.<br />I'm very excited about what's going to happen next now, and I'm very intrigued by the feathers Fitz found on the beach. Quick, on to Golden Fool!pped by the Piebalds, a group of Witted rebels claiming that the Prince also has the Wit?

So I grew even fonder of the Fool, or was sometimes shocked by Fitz's violent reactions, etc. In the end I realize my favourite author hasn't let me down, and this sure is one of my favourite books.<br />I'm very excited about what's going to happen next now, and I'm very intrigued by the feathers Fitz found on the beach. Quick, on to Golden Fool!
B000005AYM|5.0|Erykah Badu's debut classic album \\"BADUIZM\\" is such a remarkable album with a blend of old school, jazz, hip-hop, rap, funk, groovy sounds, you name it. She's such a powerful artist with more rhythm to get in2 your soul. I actually luv her from the beginning since she put out her first album. Well the first tape I ever listen from her was she taped it live support her most classic masterpiece to date. This what changed me. I would love to go pick it up and definitely recommend D'Angelo, Guru, Alicia Keys, Jill Scott, Floetry, Dwele, Groove Theory, Maxwell, The Brand New Heavies feat. N'Dea Davenport, Jamiroquai, Common, The Roots, Tribe Called Quest, Kanye West, Mos Def, Talib Kweli, Slum Village, John Legend, Anthony Hamilton, Heather Headley, and many others I can see on my list. <br />Love her voice hopes she puts out 'nother one in the future.
B0000AGWJ7|5.0|Just curious.  I was suprised to see that this CD is over a year old.  A friend sent me the video \\"Unholy Confessions\\" and I've been hooked.  This is really GREAT music no matter what genre you try to \\"peg\\" it as.  The best part for me is that no two songs sound alike and many are polar opposites.  I recommend this to fans of Metallica, Iron Maiden, Shadows Fall, Killswitch Engage, Slipknot, etc.... Great music!
B00005AR3G|5.0|I have four needs ranging in ages from nine down to two.  What this means is that I have seen pretty much every Disney flick over and over and over again.  While I like many of the more recent crop (starting in the early 90's), this is definitely one of my favorites.  For some reason, it seems to have been pretty much ignored by the Disney marketing machine, actually being released in November, but it's crisp dialog, fantastic vocal work (David Spade and Patrick Warburton are standouts, but the entire cast is very good), fast pace and beautiful scenery not only keep my kids interested, but also have enough to make it palatable for adults.  My criteria for a good kids movie is one that I don't mind watching more than once.  This one definitely passes.  It's a choice that you won't be disappointed with.

B0000TB01Y|5.0|ok, I've never seen the show, but i'd love to!!  this soundtrack is absolutely amazing!  Idina Menzel's voice is so powerful and sweet, she's just the perfect Elphie.  Kristin Chenoweth's voice is so upbeat and beautiful, she's the perfect G(a)linda as well.  if you enjoy broadway music, i can assure you that you will love wicked!  i only wish i could have seen the show with the original cast.  seriously, the music in wicked is so original and different.  i never get bored, and listen to the cd every day! i can't go a day without it!
0140177396|3.0|i believe the book 'of mice and men' is a good book because it clearly states teh facts of life in that paticular era. The book also shows how life was for two men who could not get a job because one of the men kept on misbehaving, this is an intresting book with ups and downs showing the problems the men encountered while trying to find a suitable place to work. this book shows the inequality and prejudices between the different kinds of people who where on the ranch where the men worked.  <br />this book is worth reading <br />Amit Dattani
B00009V7P8|2.0|I almost didn't buy this CD after listening to the previews on Amazon.  I couldn't believe how 'off' this guy was singing, but the rave reviews convinced me otherwise.  When I got the CD, I was amazed at the inconsistency in his voice.  He hits so many off-notes that it is painful to listen.  There are so many great voices out there that this guy doesn't deserve the accolades he is given. Not even close to a good CD.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|First of all everyone who gave this five stars where correct, I am just putting in my two cents, I concur...You can stop reading now... The only bitter feelings this movie has provoked is the fact that my sister Cait did not buy me the DVD for Christmas! The same girl I raised, pretty much single handed! I sang Don McClain (sp) songs to her while I changed her fouled diapers,put warm water on her meat gravey flavored chow(softens the nuggets) and routinely fished her out of the mud hole we rode our dirt bikes through, heck I'm the one who put the carp in there so she would have someone to play with.  If you did continue to read when I suggested you stop understand this is all based on fact. Including this gem,Elvis Costello in the 1980s  declared that he would no longer be known as Elvis Costello, but instead as Napoleon Dynamite, under which name he released what may have been his last great album, BLOOD AND CHOCOLATE.In addition to this gem, I copied this fact from a better reviewer than myself. If you click the button below that indicates that this review proved helpful, I just might send you a dollar. Remember not to judge a person untill you have walked a mile in their shoes, then you can cast all sorts of stones and you also have a new pair of shoes.
B00000DFMM|5.0|A CD that sounds transcends time really, Secret Wish sounds more like it could be released today, not 20 years ago.  It's hard to believe this music was done without MIDI technology.    Perhaps one of the finest synthpop releases of the 80s, dare I say ever.  Smart and eclectic, with outstanding vocals.  \\"Duel\\" is probably one of my all time favorite songs.  \\"Dream within in Dream\\" provides an outstanding opening, \\"P-Machinery\\" is a great dance track, and who can forget the scene in \\"Some Kind of Wonderful\\" that features \\"Dr. Mabuse\\".    Expertly produced by Stephen Lipson (with Trevor Horn) who worked with Grace Jones and Frankie Goes to Hollywood soon after. Well worth adding to any collection.
0385510454|5.0|I really enjoyed this one. I am very busy and tend to read books at a snells pace, getting in a few pages when I have the time, but I couldn't put this one down and finished in one day. I would definitely rank this in the top 3 of Grisham novels if not number one.
B0006399FS|5.0|I have been a huge U2 fan for a long time, I own all of their records (even Pop) and I can say that it took some time for me to really give the album a good listen, but after doing so I hold it in the same regard as The Joshua Tree and Achtung Baby. Atomic Bomb is the best sounding album U2 has put out in years. Edge, Clayton, and Larry Mullen have put together an album that is a lot more rock n roll than their last CD, and should be considered a musical return to their roots. Bono's lyrics remain solid, and seem to be a little more concrete than those on the previous album. The album finishes strong with the best songs being on the latter half of the CD, the best of which (in my opinion) is \\"Original of the Species\\". I think this is one of the best songs U2 has done in its whole catalogue and is the sleeper track on the Cd. \\"Love and Peace\\" displays Bono's shift from lyrics that are politically charged to ones that are socially charged. \\"City of Blinding Lights\\" (written about New York) is a catchy love song and \\"All Because of You\\" will certainly be successful as their next single. Edge's accoustic guitar on \\"Man and a Woman\\" is outstanding and \\"Crumbs from Your Table\\" reminds me a lot of songs like \\"One\\" and \\"So Cruel\\" from the Achtung Baby Cd. In summary, this CD grows on me more after each listen. Huge U2 fans like myself have a lot to be greatful for, that after 25 years, the band is still together, and still putting out records of the same calibur. \\"Atomic Bomb\\" proves U2 is the best rock band going.
1400032717|5.0|I am not autistic. I do not have Asperger's Syndrome. However, I have studied the syndrome to a certain degree, and so was thrilled when I heard about this book. Books written from the point of view of people with Asperger's can be horrible -- a certain novel whose title I have long repressed comes to mind -- but this one escapes that fate, and in the end is a lovely read.  <br /> <br />The best thing about The Curious Incident is Haddon's empathetic and accepting way of writing Christopher. In many books, especially books about teenagers, the authors cannot seem to fully dive into the characters' minds; instead, they are a step away, and they often insert judgement of the characters into the narration. Happily, The Curious Incident avoids this problem. Christopher is always believable. Never once did Haddon use judgemental language or step out of character. The book might as well have been written by a teenage boy with Asperger's Syndrome for its level of believability. It is this quality that lifts the novel above the level of just ordinary and makes it something that I recommend glowingly to everyone I know. Yes, the plot is interesting and it is well written, but the strength of character is the heart of the book. Christopher's charm will win you over, and you'll love every moment of it.
B00028HBKM|4.0|I held off watching this movie because I had heard so much about the blood and gore. But I knew that I would eventually see it. I embrace the story of Christ and the power of his teachings. Though this film contains only a few scenes of his life and ministry, the depiction of torture and the crucifixion aptly conveys a message of love - that is, what Christ was willing to suffer for all mankind. The imagery of the devil was well-placed. And, to me at least, the story moved at a good pace - not too fast, not too slow. Moreover, James Caviezel's performance was outstanding. However, I was not moved emotionally (or, spiritually) the way I had anticipated. Perhaps it was the hype. But I'm glad that it got so much (well-deserved) attention.
0385508417|5.0|This was a fun book. It was a quick read and I found it tough to put down. I called it my \\"purse book\\" because I carried it with me and read whenever I had a few minutes. This proved to be quite embarrassing because I would be somewhere reading it and begin laughing out loud. Is this the best book I ever read? No. But I gave it 5 stars because it made me laugh, I talked about it and I recommended it to several friends. It is worth a read.
B0002Z0EYK|3.0|Bold and ambitious, \\"Troy\\" adds little to the historical epic genre. It has all the right moves in the epic area - great battles, great sets, etc. On the human scale, it succeeds barely at all. Still, it has an overall grandeur and sweep that is both entertaining and interesting. It succeeds in spite of its flaws.  <br /> <br />In the great epics - from \\"The Ten Commandments\\" to \\"Spartacus\\" to \\"Gladiator\\" - there is a balance between great battles for great causes and the love between a man and a woman.  <br /> <br />\\"Troy\\" doesn't succeed on the human level. The legend is that the Greek Paris [Orlando Bloom] took Helen of Troy [Diane Kruger] away from her husband, the King [Brian Cox], which caused the Trojan War. But nothing in the relationship between Paris and Troy suggests a great passion that would cause a great war. The subplot about the great warrior Achilles' [Brad Pitt] love of a Trojan priestess is much more involving, but it hardly explains reasons for the war.  <br />

034537410X|4.0|This book is a must for anyone interested in lucid dreams because it presents such a complete overview of the subject.  However, there are several shortcomings.  First:  The style is somewhat dry and academic, which is fine if you're only interested in the facts, otherwise it might seem a bit boring.  Second:  Laberge give numerous tips for inducing lucid dreams, but success seems to depend more on a positive attitude than technique--they do help, but the results are often minimal.  Third:  This last criticism concerns the out-of-body experience, or OBE.  Laberge seems to consider the OBE as just another dream.  But for those of us who have experienced one, there is a subtle but real difference.  Perhaps the subject was too esoteric for Laberge, but for those interested in both, Oliver Fox's \\"Astral Projection: A Record of Out-Of-The-Body Experiences\\" contains a personal account of Fox's attempt at distinguishing the two.  Read Leberge first, then Fox for an eyeopener.
B0002OERI0|2.0|Well, reading through these reviews, I figured, hey, doesn't seem bad, rarely have reviews been so wrong.  Where do you I even start, I don't want to make too much of it, because my 2 stars should pretty much speak for themselves, but there is nothing new in this at all.  There is no innovation, you pretty much hear the same riffs and powerchords in every song.  They all kind of run together and blend, unfortunately, with a non-cohesive overall experience.  I guess I should have known what I was getting into.  I'm glad I have Motorhead's Inferno to get me through the disharmony that American Idiot left in my mind.  Sure made me feel like an American Idiot when I bought it.<br /><br />  The only reason I gave it 2 stars is the fact that I definately have some listening bias, and although this would appeal to some, you're all better off just burning it, and saving your money for something good (like Motorhead's Inferno, or Megadeths The System Has Failed).
0380973650|5.0|After serving three years in jail, Shadow's sentence is almost up. He is looking forward to returning to his old life: his wife, his best friend, and the job he has waiting for him in his old hometown. Suddenly his world is turned upside down. He is released several days early into a mind numbly void world, not at all the happy life he had expected. A chance meeting (or is it chance?) with the mysterious Mr. Wednesday sees him gainfully employed against his will, in a position he has learned to fill over the years all too well - driver, occasional heavy, companion. And why not? Everything else in his life is gone: wife, friend, job, and normalcy.<br /><br />What Shadow does not realize is that he is now working for one of our oldest deities. These deities, these Gods, walk amongst us, live amongst us, and tragically, die amongst us. Their existence is the result of what people have imagined and believed since the beginnings of time. It is the old chicken and the egg paradox - which came first. People or Gods?<br /><br />In American Gods there is a war coming, a war between the old gods and the new. A war which spurs a road-trip across America, delving deep into the myths and legends of this relatively new world. A war whose prize will be the \\"very soul of America.\\" A war fought by those clinging to the last staunchly believing souls who keep them alive, and those who harbour the favor of almost all of humanity in our present time. To complicate matters, Shadow is not sure whose side he is on, much less, what he is expected to do.<br /><br />Shadow learns much as he traverses the land with Mr. Wednesday, both from Mr. Wednesday and from Mr. Wednesday's odd friends. He learns as well from his own chance encounters. He learns about himself and about the world around him. The secrets, which were once carefully hidden from him, begin to come to take shape, and Shadow is left with a far greater understanding of the universe and his place within that universe. He learns of secrets that hurt, and of secrets that heal. However, Shadow's personal journey is perhaps the darkest one of all, and there is no help along the way.<br /><br />Neil has provided me with the most thought provoking reading experience I think I have ever had. It has forever changed the way I look at things, how I perceive the world around me. Surely, there is room for all of these gods in our world? After all, we are the ones who created them. As is to be expected from Neil, this is a darkly disturbing work, which will hold you captive until you have reached the end of the book, and far beyond. This story will crawl into your subconscious and arouse thoughts you never before have entertained, and may never again. The characters are very strong and believable. They will live on in your memory long after you put the book down. The plot flows along smoothly and unconstrained, sweeping you up and over the waterfall you had no warning was awaiting you.<br /><br />Review Originally Posted at LinearReflections.comearns of secrets that hurt, and of secrets that heal.

B000268QB2|5.0|Think of Tears for Fears,Coldplay, Moody Blues with a touch of Linkin Park electonics, throw in a little passion and we have a winner!  I really have to stop listening to it so as not to burn myself out so soon.  At first listen, the first few songs sound very similar...but wait until you hear songs 9,10, & 11! Very cool.  The over all album has an unforgettable warm feeling about it.  A MUST HAVE!
B000005HFH|5.0|Chet Baker's voice was simply a continuation of his trumpet playing, smooth and cool, with a musicality and a delicacy that can melt one's heart. His pleasing voice is high and reedy...if voices were an orchestra, Baker's would be the oboe.<br />These are recordings from 1953 through 1956, in their original form, without the many alterations that were to surface in later years with overdubs, etc.<br />Baker's liking for the great melodic songs of the past was our gain, and his first recorded vocal was the beautiful \\"The Thrill is Gone\\" (Brown-Henderson), and his rendition of the Rodgers and Hart \\"My Funny Valentine\\" is a classic, and gave him a hit when he was with the Gerry Mulligan group, making him famous. A big favorite of mine is the haunting \\"You Don't Know What Love Is\\" (Raye-DePaul), which in the simplicity of his pared-down style, is moving to the core.<br /><br />Baker (1929-1988) was fresh out of the military in '53, clean-cut and handsome, but by 1960 heroin became a major part of his life, and his career rapidly declined, and included some jail time in Italy; by the time he suffered a fatal fall from an Amsterdam hotel window, he was a toothless, haggard soul, another life ruined by substance abuse.<br />He reached his peak in his mid-20s, and this fabulous CD captures his very best.<br />The recordings are with his own group, which has musicians like Shelly Manne on drums and Russ Freeman on piano.<br />The sound has a little age to it, but the content makes it irrelevant, and total playing time is 64'16.
B0001HLVS2|5.0|My 83 y/o Mom and I saw this movie and LOVED it, for the adventure, the relationships(particularly b/w Maturin and Aubrey, echoed in the violin/cello relationships, as well as that between Aubrey and Hollom, and Maturin and Blakeny), the intelligence, the MUSIC (the soundtrack is a MUST HAVE), the cinematography,the stop-off at the Galapagos, and on and on.... The feeling of high seas adventure was transporting... i am usually the Merchant-Ivory type and not fond of violent movies but this movie was just magnificent, and i didn't feel the violence was at all gratuitous. Russell Crowe was amazing, as were Max Perkis, Lee Ingleby and Paul Bettany. (There was a lot of testosterone on that ship!!! ) One of the best movies I have seen in a very long time. Look forward to reading the books. <br />
0131177052|4.0|Feathers confronts a depressingly familiar problem encountered by many programmers. How to maintain a system of legacy code? Where often there has been no rigorous attempt to test it. Even in a manual fashion. He shows ways to build a test harness to automatically test the code. Even if this does not perform an exhaustive test, it may still be far in advance of what you already have (nothing?) to validate the code. He writes assuming that you might never have met a disciplined testing approach. So unit testing is carefully explained and he builds from there.<br /><br />Simple, useful patterns like Decorator are described. The book is not meant as a comprehensive exposition of patterns. But hopefully, you can see the general idea of patterns and its utility. Large portions of the book are essentially about refactoring legacy code into these patterns, if possible. And also about testing your changes in a systematic way. If you do the former, you should also do the latter.<br /><br />The examples are mostly in C++ and Java. But that's neither here nor there, if you program in other languages like C# or C. The ideas from the examples carry over well.

0380789019|5.0|Reading this was making me feel in touch once more with the fairy tales that I had read as a child. I loved that anything was possible and that there was magic to be found in the mundane. <br /> <br />The one thing that I had really liked was that Richard Mayhew was a complete everyman. It made it more believable to get inside his point of view and relate to his situation. The characters were highly realized and were definately real. Door, The Marquis and Hunter felt like friends as I was reading it. <br /> <br />Also, Neil's writing style is just fabulous. I love that his writing is fast past. I have sat there, reading it and got through fifty pages of it without realizing how much time has passed. It is absorbing and engulfing. <br /> <br />Overall, a great book, possibly a classic.
B00000IL26|5.0|Blue Note records released an unbelievably consistent string of impeccably performed and recorded sessions from the mid 50's to the late 60's.  Picking out the best of these is like picking the best diamond out of a sack full of 'em.<br /><br />So it is in some elite company that Lee Morgan's The Sidewinder finds itself.  The classic title workout might be one of the best known songs in the history of Jazz.  This isn't cerebral stuff like Dolphy or Monk, or even virtuoso stuff if that means Davis and Coltrane.  It's smokin' soulful Jazz with an emphasis on the beat, never done better.<br /><br />The rest of the session follows suit in classic fashion.  If you want an instant soul-jazz party atmosphere, this is your CD.  One factor I use in rating CD's is how much I play them, and this CD is ready to wear out I play it so much.  Five Stars!
B00008AY3L|5.0|This cd falls into the catagory of \\"if you were stranded on an island and only had one cd\\", this is the one I would pick. Every song is completely different from the next. Every song kicks ass and leaves you wanting more. Diamonds on the inside will open your mind. Thanks Ben!
B000003S0D|4.0|This album is something of a redheaded stepchild in the Crimson discography.  The groundbreaking original version of KC had made it (barely) intact through two albums, and the 2nd classic lineup featuring Robert Fripp, John Wetton and Bill Bruford was still on the horizon.  Of the two records Fripp made in between, I think Lizard is way better than Islands.<br /><br />On Lizard, Fripp's jazzy tendencies came to the forefront, but he wisely eases you in with the more \\"conventional\\" prog piece \\"Cirkus.\\"  Woodwind meister Mel Collins was the only holdover from the Poseidon album, and quickly establishes himself as a worthy soloist to spar with Fripp.  \\"Cirkus\\" is definitly worth a listen for prog fanatics, as is the band's first and only sidelong epic, \\"Lizard,\\" which features vocals from Jon Anderson of Yes in a classic prog-crossover moment.  At the time this record was being made, Yes was searching for a guitarist and supposedly Fripp was one of the candidates.  Imagine how Yes would have turned out if Fripp took the job instead of Steve Howe!<br /><br />Elsewhere on this album, \\"Indoor Games\\" and \\"Happy Family\\" debut an avant-jazz sound, with some interesting Beatles-related lyrics on the latter.  Guest pianist Keith Tippet is back to help out, along with some nice horns and woodwinds from Nick Evans, Mark Charig and Robin Miller, the latter two of whom reprised their roles on 1974's Red album.  \\"Lady of the Dancing Waters\\" is quite short but also quite nice.<br /><br />They had short tenures with KC, but singer-bassist Gordon Haskell and drummer Andy McCulloch do a pretty good job here of holding the fort.  Bigger and better albums were coming, but I still play and enjoy Lizard a lot, so I give it 4 stars.
B0002J4X1Q|5.0|Face it: game to movie adaptations don't work. They're either way too long and complex that an hour and a half movie doesn't cut it like Final Fantasy, which always need to be long and good 20-40 hours at most, or not enough story so the filmmakers try to make a story out of it like Street Fighter or Mortal Kombat. Oddly enough, the latter was made by the director of this film also, Paul Anderson. I actually found myself willingly watching Mortal Kombat rather than it being on superstation and nothing else on. His 2nd adaptation is slightly better but still fun. <br /> <br />Meant as a prequel to the first game in which Jill Valentine and Chris Redfield have to fight their way through a zombie-infested mansion, this takes place beforehand where employees of a secret research facility known as the Hive are killed by the computer. Alice(not named till the credits) is then taken by commandos into the Hive to shut down the computer. They also find Spencer and Matt, a cop.  <br /> <br />After a rather grisly scene, they shut down the Hive's computer, but that unlocks all the doors and the undead escape. In the research facility, they're developing a biological weapon known as the T-Virus which reanimates dead blood cells but brings them to it's most simplest want: to eat, and they have a taste for blood and flesh, oddly. So they have to make it out of the Hive before they're trapped. <br /> <br />I think one complaint that I have with the film is that it doesn't FEEL Resident Evil. Instead of quiet atmospheric rooms with dim lighting and ambient music, you get full-blown lighting and loud music, courtesy of Marilyn Manson. As far as gore goes, this one's more gorier than the sequel, Apocalypse which was more implied. Here you get decapitations, cut in half and in one scene, guy falling in chunks after meeting a laser grid. Kudos on the ending though, which ends on a nice downnote and sets things up for the sequel. <br /> <br />All in all, it's not going to win an academyaward, might incite laughter from the spoken dialogue, but yet just might love it.
B000003S0I|5.0|What do you do if you're Robert Fripp in 1972?  Your original version of King Crimson practically invented Prog Rock, then you had to sit and watch bands like Genesis and Yes storm up the charts while your own band can't keep a lineup together long enough to make any impact.  If you're Robert Fripp, you gather together some of the best musicians in England and reinvent the whole thing all over again, that's what!<br /><br />It was said of bassist John Wetton in those days, that he couldn't go for a pint at the local pub without getting an invitation to join some top-flight British group.  Bill Bruford had turned heads as the amazing jazz-influenced drummer with Yes.  Violinist/keyboard player David Cross and crazy percussionist Jamie Muir rounded out this electrifying and daring version of King Crimson, and the results were this astounding album.<br /><br />The 2-part title instrumental bookends this record and lays out a manifesto for the '72-'74 Crimson, where improvisation and stunning contrast between light and dark took precedence over most lingering notions of \\"symphonic\\" Prog.  But just to make sure you know it's Crimson, \\"Exiles\\" hauls out the mellotron and a good old prog epic finds it's way into the mix.  For me the most thrilling moment on the album is the hair-raising finale to \\"Lark's Tongue's II.\\"  I've heard it literally hundreds of times and it still makes me jump up and say \\"Yeah!\\"  Now that's classic.<br /><br />Essential listening for Prog fans.
B0000B1OE7|5.0|Well, isn't most anime for grown-ups anyway? There's some children ones too I guess. For every Tenchi and Pokemon and Ranma 1/2 there's Evangelion, Hellsing, Vampire Hunter D and Akira. Yet for some reason, people always think that animated means children based. Well this is one film you should show people that have that mindset, it's gory, it's violent, and yet it's entertaining. <br /> <br />Jubei is basically a wanderer, a mercenary ninja taking odd jobs for money. Kagero and fellow Kogi clan members investigate people caught in what looked like a viral outbreak. While investigating, they find Tessai, a strange guy who can turn his body to stone and throws a heavy blade, in what results in probably the most goriest scene in the film. He captures Kagero and tries to make love to her(really bad at that too by the way), enter Jubei who rescues her. <br /> <br />She takes off and he encounters an old man whose name escapes me oddly enough. He tells him to take a mission which Jubei refuses until he's poisoned by him so he reluctanctly takes it. There, Jubei finds there's a plot to get rid of the Tokugawa Shogunate(the political party in control of Japan at the time) and ascend themselves to power. <br /> <br />Not only that, Jubei finds the 8 Demons of Gimon: 8 people with incredibly bizarre abilities. It reminded me of the Metal Gear games recently with enemies and bizarre abilities. In the film, you'll find a woman with control over snakes, a ninja who can disappear into shadow, a blind man with incredible hearing, a man with a hive in his back and the leader, who is capable of reincarnation and regenerating his limbs. <br /> <br />The gore is quite violent with ripped off arms, a man torn into 2, other men ripped in half and one's head sliding down his own blade. There is nudity also, one woman has a habit of being nude quite a bit, while there's an attempted rape in the beginning and something that looks like anal sex(or just entering from the back, who knows).<br /> <br />This film is definately not for the little kiddies but for the adults? They just might enjoy themselves.
B000002UB3|5.0|If someone put a gun to my head and made me pick one and only one greatest album ever, it would be Abbey Road.  So what can possibly be left to be said about the greatest album ever?  Not much.  Some Beatles fans will insist on \\"Revolver\\" or \\"Sgt. Pepper\\" but for me, it's this album, where every single second of music is absolutely perfect.  Every. Single. Second.  Those are 5-star albums, but \\"Abbey Road\\" is off the charts and into the stratosphere.  I have listened to Paul McCartney sing \\"Golden Slumbers\\" I don't know how many countless times in my life and it gives me goosebumps every time, and I suspect it always will.  The mark of a true classic.<br /><br />Side One (in vinyl terms) is a virtual late-period Greatest Hits album in and of itself.  There's no need to go into them one by one.  Everyone knows them, everyone loves them.  Stone cold timeless classics one after the other after the other.  Unbelievable.<br /><br />Most people know the story of Side Two of \\"Abbey Road.\\"  This may not have been their last album to be released but it was in fact the last Beatles album, and they were disintegrating as it was recorded.  In desperation, Paul McCartney was forced to complete the album by gathering together a bunch of unfinished tracks, snipping out the best parts, and artfully weaving them together into a suite of pop genius.  To see the influence of Paul's experiment, fast-forward 25 years to Guided by Voices masterpiece \\"Bee Thousand.\\"<br /><br />Very few albums are solid all the way through.  To be this solid all the way through is ridiculous.  Starts off as a virtual encyclopedia of Rock greatness, then, impossibly, gets even better and better.<br /><br />Amazon cannot offer enough stars to rate Abbey Road. If you don't own this, buy it right now.
B0002X314C|4.0|John Legend brings back what real music has been missing. He put the music of today and the music of the past together to create beautiful music that everyone can enjoy and love. All I can really say about a CD like this is \\"it about time.\\" Thank You John Legand.
B00005AFMT|5.0|When the reformed King Crimson released this record at the dawn of the 80's, us prog rock fans didn't know quite what to make of it.  Anyone expecting a return to the sound of the Greg Lake or John Wetton eras was in for a surprise.  In truth, anyone who was surprised just hadn't been paying attention to Robert Fripp's career.  Fripp had aligned himself with the new wave and with art-rockers like Bowie and Gabriel after the first KC breakup, and those influences blended with the cerebral math-rock of KC's 1974 masterpiece \\"Red\\" to create a new kind of progressive rock, one more in keeping with the actual meaning of the word \\"progressive.\\"<br /><br />Bill Bruford was back on the drumstool, albeit with a new array of sounds from electronic drums and \\"boo-bams.\\"  New vocalist/guitarist Adrian Belew had worked with Talking Heads, and brought a bit of that sound along to the mix.  Bassist and Chapman Stick maestro Tony Levin almost makes you forget about John Wetton with his virtuosity.  In their history up to this point,  KC always had a sax or violin player to trade leads with Fripp, while Discipline for the first time found him playing off another guitarist.  Belew's adventurous sounds pushed Fripp to follow suit, and the results were phenomenal.<br /><br />In the early 80's I wasn't that crazy about the \\"new\\" King Crimson.  I was also an idiot back then so that matters not a whit.  Discipline is a stone cold classic.  If you love this stuff you absolutely have, and I mean HAVE to get the DVD \\"Neal and Jack and Me,\\" which documents this era of KC in 2 almost-complete concerts.  Essential and priceless.
B0006A9FMI|1.0|This dvd has terrible subtitles. Everytime there is a sound like footsteps or beeping, the subtitles show it. Whoever did the subtitles must be a complete amateur or a moron. This is probably a good movie but since I don't speek japanese I refused to watch because of the subtitling. I can only blame Dreamworks since the other Ghost in the Shell DVDs not from Dreamworks seem to be quite adequate. I don't understand why they were so cheap as to not include an English dub as well.
B000003S0B|3.0|King Crimson is one of my favorite bands ever, but this is not one of their stronger efforts.  Band leader Robert Fripp was quite prolific during the 1969-1974 period, but in this case he wasn't about to let a lack of material, or worse yet the lack of an actual band, stop him from releasing a followup to the breakthrough debut album.<br /><br />Greg Lake stuck around long enough to do most of the vocals, although he was already committed to Emerson Lake & Palmer.  Drummer Michael Giles had one foot out the door too, and Ian McDonald had split.  Fripp signed on woodwind phenomenon Mel Collins and singer/bassist Gordon Haskell, who made a brief appearance here.<br /><br />This album is often accused of being a copy of the debut, and in my view it's two best tracks, \\"Pictures of a City\\" and \\"In the Wake of Poseidon\\" certainly bear this out.  They happen to be my favorite tracks on here though, and pretty much are my only reason for playing this.  \\"Pictures\\" and \\"Poseidon\\" are both kind of forgotten clssics in KC's vast canon, but I can't say the same for the rest of this CD.<br /><br />\\"Devil's Triangle\\" is an overlong instrumental ripped off from Holst (Fripp gave himself writing credit!) that the band had been playing live.  It holds my interest for about 2 of it's 11 minutes.  \\"Cat Food\\" is an OK jazzy piece with Keith Tippet on piano.  \\"Cadence and Cascade\\" has some unremarkable vocals from Haskell and embarrassingly bad, misogynist lyrics.  Nice acoustic from Fripp though.<br /><br />The overall production is pretty bad.  Some of the \\"Peace\\" segments throughout the record are mixed so low you have to crank up the volume just to hear them, then turn it back down  before the next song starts.  On the rest of the album the production is kind of drab and lifeless, and the reissue doesn't do much to improve it.<br /><br />Not the place to start with Crimson, but progheads should eventually get it just for \\"Pictures of a City\\" and the title track.

B000003S09|5.0|In this day and age, fans of any particular band are lucky to get maybe 3 new releases in a 7 year span.  Between 1969 and 1975, King Crimson released 7 studio albums and 2 live albums, with a dizzying number of lineup and stylistic changes.  King Crimson lives on to this day, an unbelievable 36 years later, and it all started here with In the Court of the Crimson King, arguably the first ever progressive rock album.<br /><br />I personally prefer the 1972-1974 Fripp-Wetton-Bruford lineup, but I still give their debut 5 stars due to it's considerable historic signifigance as well as the fact that it still stands up as a great prog rock/classic rock album.<br /><br />With the opening blast of \\"21st Century Schizoid Man,\\" Fripp and company bravely fused hard rock with free jazz to create one of their signature songs, and also provide a peek into the band's future direction.  \\"Epitaph\\" and the title epic bring out the mellotrons and Greg Lake's choirboy vocals and progressive rock was born.<br /><br />Those 3 tracks are all you really need to know as the other 2 are kind of hippy-dippy headshop tunes that are pleasant enough but badly dated.  Those 3 classic tracks merit 5 stars on their own.<br /><br />This lineup would disintegrate almost immediately.  Lake met Keith Emerson while KC was touring America with The Nice, and ELP was born.  Drummer Mike Giles stuck around for one more album but had announced his intention to leave.  Multi-instrumentalist Ian McDonald (later of Foreigner) was history.  And the mighty Crim would soldier on to even higher highs than this.
B000660UN0|5.0|The Crowning Jewel of Clapton's blues repertoire!  Watch the DVD first.....then sit back and absorb the CD!  Along with Me And Mr. Johnson Clapton pays an excellent tribute to Robt. J.  For guitarists out there Clapton discusses on the DVD how he plays the Johnson material and those out there who have tried to play his tunes are familiar with the oddities.  My only complaint is overlapping tunes from this and Me And Mr. Johnson.  For me the best part is on the DVD where Clapton and Bramhall play in the old abandoned office building where Johnson recorded in the 30's......Bramhall on National Steel and Clapton on his Martin......pure blues bliss!
B00005JNBQ|5.0|The wonderful thing about \\"Napoleon Dynamite\\" is the humanity of the characters.  Perhaps those who did not find this movie funny were either (a) like Summer Wheatley, so wrapped up in themselves that they never took any effort to really know the people around them, or (b)have yet to learn to laugh at themselves and their own shortcomings.  The characters are well-developed and deeper than they first appear, and the actors have perfected their characters' personas. The situations are what makes this film so funny, and when you stop to think about the things that you thought were so important to you in High School, it makes this film even funnier. <br /> <br />This movie is bursting with heart, and carries two important messages that could be heard loud and clear above the laughter: (1) IT TAKES TREMENDOUS PERSONAL FORTITUDE TO RISK LOOKING LIKE A FOOL TO HELP A FRIEND, and (2) REGARDLESS OF HOW GEEKY, HAPLESS OR DIFFERENT YOU ARE, THERE IS SOMEONE IN THIS WORLD WHO WILL LOVE YOU.  When it comes down to it, those are the core teachings of Christ: \\"There is no greater love than to lay down your life for a friend\\", and \\"Love your neighbor as yourself\\". For anyone who has ever suffered humiliation at the hands of those who did not have the courage to be themselves, or to take any stand whatsoever, this movie rings true. <br /> <br />Moreover, like \\"The Breakfast Club\\" and other teen movies that came after, \\"Napolean Dynamite\\" gives us a glimpse of adolescence through the actions and reactions of characters who have no idea that they are living some of the best times of their lives.  As sad and frustrating as Napoleon's existence seems to be, there are two characters in the film who affirm that the future will be more and less than he imagines. Older brother Kip finds true love in his chat-room soulmate (\\"LaFawnduh is the best thing that ever happened to me... Napoleon, I'm sure you will find your soulmate one day\\").  Uncle Rico so longs for his lost youth and a second chance that he resorts to a \\"time machine\\" that he buys on-line (\\"If coach had just put me in for the fourth quarter, we would have won state. I just know it!\\"). In each case, the elder characters' lives serve as confirmation and caution for the future. <br /> <br />One last thumbs-up for this film:  It proves that a film can be entertaining, funny and meaningful without coarse language, gratuitous sex or violence, or a $20 million budget. <br /> <br />Well done Mr. and Mrs. Hess!  We anxiously await your next project. <br /> <br />Peace out!
6302054982|5.0|Being a true story makes this movie that extra bit magnificent. The movie presents to you the lifestyle of the mafia in italy in a powerful dramatic style of film shown through the eyes of a person who was stealing for the mafia as a child and grew up in their atmosphere shows right from the beginning how things worked whilst living with the mob, knowing everyone, having a lot of extra relations, the money and the work they go through in order to get it.<br /><br />As the movie progresses the main character finds things more and more difficult and ends up running for his own life from those who were especially close to him throughout his life.<br /><br />The movie is presented in the best posiible way and is also quite edjucational i give it the five stars and i strongly suggest that you watch it aswell.
B0006399FS|5.0|I just love this album! Streets ahead of any other rock album you will come accross these days. You want good rock music with great melodies and good song writing, you should definitely buy this. People who seem to critisize this album seem to do so due to the fact that U2 did an ipod add or because they sold out etc... . Well for one thing they never got paid for the ipod add, they are just selling their music. Also U2 sold out long ago anyone who doesnt know that must have lived under a rock for the last 20 years. Lots of other bands havent \\"sold out\\" because they just arent good enough!!
B00005JNEI|3.0|The things I can admit to in this movie is that it is extremely well done the editing is quite perfect and the movie is a great documentary, if it wasn't for the fact that i totally disagree with the subject i guess the movie would get the four stars from me for sure.<br /><br />If you're a smart person you would be able to see as I do and the mojority of Americans (since they realected George Bush) that the facts that Michael has presented to you in his latest documentary, the facts that supposably cut all corners and cover everything that George Bush really is are twisted facts they have been edited in a hundred different areas to present the best possible argument to drop the bomb on George Bush and even with all the intewiews and facts he presented, if you have watched the news are countered in a thousand different ways to suggest that Michael is just a big luni who needs a proper job rather than stir up trouble.<br /><br />In the movie he interviews about three American soldiers (all teenagers by the way) and asks them what they feal as they're shooting down the enemy in the meen time he has the song burn mother!!!!burn.<br /><br />Anyways I suggest that you watch the movie for yourself and review your own personal fealings, i still suggest that you watch the movie and hopefully you're not dumd enough to be sucked in aswell.

B0001WTVUW|3.0|I never saw this film in the 1980s; my mother wouldn't let me watch it.  I was in sixth grade and I was terrified of nuclear war.  I'm glad that I wasn't able to see this film when I was 11 years old -- I probably would have had nightmares for months (maybe even needed therapy), such was my fear of a nuclear war.  I saw the film at Target and had to buy it (it was only $9.44).  I'm glad I did.  In fact, I applaud Target (and hopefully other retailers) for prominently displaying the film at their point-of-sale areas, which is what prompted me to buy it.  Although the special effects may not be what we're used to seeing in films and on TV nowadays, the film is still a seriously disturbing exploration of a nuclear war and the subsequent nigtmare that ensues as a result.  I believe that the threat of nuclear war is still a reality today, whether it's provoked or accidental, and I think this film should be mandatory viewing (along with \\"Threads\\") for any man or woman who is appointed the leader of a nation with nuclear capabilities.  Nuclear war is simply unacceptable and it should be unimaginable as well.  The images in this film will convince anyone of that.   <br /> <br />One line in particular from in the film resonated with me.  An academic was speaking with a group of people holed up at the University of Kansas during the aftermath.  They had just listended to a speech on the radio given by the fictional U.S. president asking Americans to basically have faith and that they would rebuild the country (yeah, right -- I think we all know the odds of that ever happening if nuclear war broke out).  Anyway, this man said to the group \\"You all know what Einstein said about how World War IV would be fought if there was a World War III, don't you?  With sticks and stones.\\"  Let's all pray that if there is ever the opportunity for a conflict of this nature to occur in the future, God forbid, that \\"cooler heads will prevail\\" in the end.  Or else it will be the end.
B000002X2B|5.0|At the height of the 60s when you believed that there just might be a chance that we could change things, we watched everyone who would or could have changed our social path be shot down. From the president, to the man who would be president, the man who made people think of discrimination, college students. The 56,000 young men who died, the 500,00 wounded and millions of Vietnamese. By the end of the 60s this was the album that told the story of the 60s. Told us if we did not want to be sucked up in the world, look beyond, find a life away. The tracks tell a story and some of the finest musicians of the 60s and early 70s were involved in this amazing album. . The music just flowed as if they knew it was the highlight of their careers and the passage of an era.. Now all went on to other bands and other good licks but put this on sit back and listen to the blending of music, vocals all intertwined like a computer made it. That was not possible back then. This is the real stuff. One of the top 10 albums , You will not be displeased and may just think a thought or two. That is still allowed. I believe.

It involves the main character of the story, Tom Joad, leaving prison and going back home to his family's house in Oklahoma, when he finds out they've left because of the dust bowl.  When he catches up with them, they're packing up to go to California.  A lot of the book is about them going to California, and them trying to settle down.  Some of the chapters in the book are symbolic, and represent Steinbeck's leftist ideals.  A lot of the people here seem to give the book a 1 star review because they can't appreciate the symbolic meaning of the turtle, and of other things.<br /><br />If you're intelligent enough to grasp the concept of symbols, you will definitely like this book.<br /><br />And yes, there is a lot of cussing in here.

0385510454|5.0|An acquaintance advised me not to read \\"The Broker,\\" John Grisham's latest novel.  She assured me that the reviews were mostly negative.  Since I do not read other reviews until after I have written my own, I decided to try \\"The Broker\\" and make up my own mind.  I'm glad I did. \\"The Broker\\" is Joel Backman, a high-powered lobbyist who puts the almighty dollar ahead of almost everything else in his life.  He disposes of wives like tissue paper, he ignores his children, and he forms short-term relationships with one gorgeous woman after another.  When he attempts to broker a deal involving a sophisticated satellite surveillance system, he gets in over his head with disastrous results.<br /><br />John Grisham again explores his recurring theme of the lone man against the establishment.  In this case, the lone man is an amoral person who has never given a moment's thought to the far-reaching consequences of his selfishness.  Because of the politically sensitive information that Backman is hiding, assassins in China, Russian, Israel, and Saudi Arabia may have targeted him for death. It seems that Joel may not have very much time to atone for his sins.<br /><br />Suddenly, Backman's life is turned upside down.  For reasons that are unclear to him, he is suddenly pardoned after six years in prison, and he hides out in Italy under the watchful eye of the CIA.  He studies Italian, eats in a variety of restaurants, and he once again learns the value of fresh air, nice scenery, a good meal, and a kind word.  Can Backman belatedly make a new life for himself before an assassin quickly ends it?<br /><br />Grisham's easygoing and fluid writing style makes this book a pleasure to read.  I loved the scenes in Italy.  Grisham captures the flavor of the country and its people, and he effortlessly shows us how Joel slowly adjusts to an existence that is unlike anything he has experienced before.<br /><br />The characters are all beautifully depicted. Teddy Maynard, the Director of the CIA, is a malevolent tyrant who is Machiavellian in his ability to manipulate people.  Neal Backman, Joel's son, is commendably loyal to his old man in spite of the disgrace that Joel has brought on his family.  Francesca, one of Joel's Italian language instructors, is a courageous and compassionate woman who teaches Joel more than just her language.<br /><br />I enjoyed many aspects of this novel, including the humorous and entertaining dialogue, intriguing spycraft, and complex political maneuvering.  What is blessedly missing is gratuitous sex and violence.  \\"The Broker\\" manages to be engrossing without the obligatory obscenity, titillation, and bloodshed that are de rigueur in many of today's novels.  Without preaching, Grisham brings home the message that a good life is measured not by the sum total of our bank accounts but by the moral values that guide our actions.tor of the CIA, is a malevolent tyrant who is Machiavellian in his ability to manipulate people.

B0000C1733|4.0|When i found out that the red hot chili peppers we're putting out a greatest hits compilation, but when i went to the record store and looked at the songs on the back and started to wonder if I should buy it. well, i did. In a perfect scenario, \\"Under the Bridge\\" and the cuts from \\"Mother's Milk\\" never appeared on the \\"What Hits!?\\" album (they have the new line-upon those) and instead, this would be the proper follow-up.  Also, the cuts from some of the albums are strange.  Here's the perfect selection (in Chronilogical order) <br /> <br />1. Higher Ground <br />2. Give It Away <br />3. Under the Bridge <br />4. Suck My Kiss <br />5. Breaking the Girl <br />6. Soul to Squeeze <br />7. Aeroplane <br />8. My Friends <br />9. Love Roller Coaster <br />10. Californication <br />11. Scar Tissue <br />12. Otherside <br />13. Paralell Universe <br />14. By the Way <br />15. The Zephyr Song <br />16. Can't Stop <br /> <br />I think they released this compilation with really bad timing.  They were still releasing singles from \\"By the Way\\" when this came out, which explains why instead of putting \\"The Zephyr Song\\" and \\"Can't Stop\\" (both HUGE songs)on here, they put \\"Universally Speaking\\". which was never promoted as a single onceoever, and the bonus tracks were pointless. You can't put bonus tracks on a greatest hits while you're still riding off another album. They're great songs but should be on their next album. The CD itself is great, though.  If you ignore the songs that should and shouldn't be here, the music is great. If you want some peppers and you don't really care about the details, get this.

B0000025FG|3.0|As a longtime ELO fan, when I bought this album, I retitled it \\"Disco...(very)\\", which I've called it ever since. One fan site I was on the other day described it as \\"a mixture of dance tracks and ballads. Some of the songs here seem a continuation of their previous release \\"Out Of the Blue\\", such as the ballad \\"Midnight Blue\\". \\"Horace Wimp\\" reflects Jeff Lynne's well-known Beatle influence as a story of an ordinary man living his ho-hum life, right out of \\"Sergeant Pepper\\", or maybe \\"Abbey Road\\". Except the chorus seems lifted from Brian Hyland's oldie \\"The Joker Went Wild\\", note-for-note but uptempo. But have you ever noticed that when Lynne adds his R & B chops to Fab Four tonalities, it comes out more like the Bee Gees when they were first moving towards disco? Like the Gibb Brothers' telegraphed punch \\"Jive Talkin'\\"? The opener \\"Shine a Little Light\\" is the best example of that here. And the opening hooks to \\"Last Train To London\\" sounds like alternate backing tracks for the Heatwave classic \\"Boogie Nights\\". As the song wears on, it sounds like something Lynne might have tried unsuccessfully to get onto the \\"Saturday Night Fever\\" soundtrack. Even in retrospect, I find it ironic that disco acts were always a bewildering mixture of a lot of technical skill but hardly any creativity. \\"Out Of the Blue\\" was enough of a nod to that empty genre as it was without this release going over the top. This one gets three stars from just one song: the single \\"Don't Bring Me Down\\", a track more consistent with \\"New World Record\\" or \\"Face the Music\\". Which is to say, this album's only rocker.
B0006B29Z2|4.0|What a fantasic overview of the early time of the band. Great for hardcore fans!!!
B0001RVQM8|4.0|Biss has quite a technique that is displayed in all 3 pieces. The first piece is genuinely interesting, because the Beethoven Fantasy is not all that well known. There is lots of virtuosic passagework, and a Germanic quality is captured.<br /><br />Davidsbundlertanze is also beautifully wrought. Everything is done in tempo, and the various moods captivated. You can tell that Biss really expends his energy in trying to play everything as well as possible.<br /><br />The Appassionata is well-done and passionately conveyed. I at first thought that the accents were over-emphasized but on repeated listenings, I found they were done in good taste.<br /><br />It's good to hear fresh young fingers in a world (of pianistic icons) that can become stale and stagnant.

Keeping with the tourditional ten songs, with the best at the begining and end, this fast set shows a more mature Slayer. Sure the themes of satanism and death are still present, but they are done with a little more complexity. The title track is still, and always will be, one of the best songs ever recorded. While \\"Reign In Blood\\" will always hold a place in my mind for getting me into thrash metal, \\"Seasons In the Abyss\\" is just as much an essential album.
0375707972|4.0|I am a slow, methodical reader. For me to sit down and consume an entire novel in \\"one go\\" is something that is quite rare, but that is exactly what happened yesterday with The Reader.<br /><br />It is a testament to the writer's ability to keep me entranced and involved with the story that once I started, I could not stop.<br /><br />The Reader is a first person narration of the life, from fifteen years onward, of one Michael Berg, in post-war Germany. As a fifteen year old he meets the vivacious 36-year old Frau Schmitz (Hanna), and he will never be the same.<br /><br />Everything about her affects him for a lifetime, in ways that he could never have imagined.<br /><br />In short pithy chapters and an economic style that never bogs down, Schlink separates the major phases of Michael's involvement with Hanna into three Parts.<br /><br />Part 1 is where we learn of Michael's sexual initiation and subsequent emotional attachment to Hanna. Serious page-flipping stuff!<br /><br />In Part 2 we are drawn into a courtroom situation (Michael is a law student) in which he is as shocked as the reader (us) to learn of the horrific nature of Hanna's secrets.<br /><br />Part 3 outlines the way in which Michael attempts to bury the past, as best he can. But it is not possible. It is not possible. Michael's past is exhumed. There were moments in this section that I found gut-wrenchingly sad, yet, presented in a beautiful way. (How does one say it?) It is brutal. Brutal sad and shockingly so.<br /><br />I will not go into WHY the book is called The Reader. That would be saying too much, I think.<br /><br />I enjoyed this book. You will sink into it quickly. But not as though into quicksand. You will walk away from it, perhaps with a heavy heart (that is one thing I should say. There is nothing humorous about this book)... your heart may be heavy afterwards, but only because it will carry the weight of knowing that there are beautiful things to be felt towards those who have done even the most atrocious things imaginable.<br /><br />Love is love.br />Love is love. <br />
B000001C6M|2.0|2.5 stars. There are a few classic songs on this album, such as \\"The Antichrist\\" and \\"Black Magic\\", but this is only the begining of how great Slayer were about to become. The guitarwork isn't that great, and the lyrics are much more tough to take seriously, both of which were completely changed on their later albums. Diehard fans will enjoy this, but you'd be much better off buying \\"Reign In Blood\\", \\"South of Heaven\\", or \\"Seasons In the Abyss\\", three of metal's finest documents. That's when Slayer went from being just another average thrash band to a truly monumental experiance.
0345440900|4.0|I think a lot of the reviewers here fail to understand that life cannot be lived exactly as described in a book.  Books can offer good advice, but you cannot rear a child exactly as described in any book.  You try a few things as described in a book, take what works for your situation and leave the rest.  That's all any book is.  Advice.  Not an instruction manual.  Babies (unfortunately) don't come standard with one of those.  :) <br /> <br />I think that this book offers great advice for my personal parenting style.  I refuse to become part of the \\"cult of the child\\" that is so prevalent these days.  Babies are babies, little people with NO experience, so they can't call all the shots.  However, you do need to let them provide a bit of input in the decisions, since they do affect the child. <br /> <br />I didn't demand feed, and this practice was vindicated for me by reading on Dr. Greene's website that allowing your baby to snack (i.e. eating more than every couple of hours) does not allow your baby to get truly hungry and does not allow mommy to replinish her milk supply, so it becomes a cycle.  So, I think this is advice from a pretty knowlegeable LC.  You can't get anything done around the house if you're constantly breastfeeding!  I breastfeed.  When my daughter was younger, we were on a 3 hour schedule and it worked perfectly.  BUT I WAS FLEXIBLE!  Sometimes, she'd be hungry again in 2-1/2 hours and I did not make her wait until the clock said she could eat.  Other times, she wasn't hungry, and since I wasn't watching the clock, I'd forget.  She wouldn't be fed until she was acting hungry. <br /> <br />And, can I say for the record that the \\"experts\\" change their mind on what's best for baby all the time?  My sister, who started having kids about 10 years before me, followed the recommendation to put her babies to sleep on their stomachs.  Now, \\"back to sleep\\" is all the rage and totally recommended.  IMO, do what works best for your child, and as long as you don't think that it's best to put the child to sleep in the fireplace with a blazing fire going, I think you'll probably be ok. <br /> <br />I also think that this book goes to the other extreme in trying to make mothers who choose to formula feed not feel guilty about their choice.  It touts formula feeding a bit more heavily than breastfeeding, probably since breastfeeding is all the rage.  I think that this book is going out of its way to make formula feeding moms feel ok about their decision. <br /> <br />And FINALLY!  I don't want to be my baby's sleepmate!  And I am so sick of reading so much literature which describes sleeping separately as something tantamount to child abuse, lol.  Again, same thing.  I think that the authors of this book want people to know that choosing to sleep separately from your child--even though it is currently trendy to co-sleep--is okay, maybe even best for baby in some cases.  I know it's best for me.  My baby is a very active sleeper sometimes! <br /> <br />Ok, I've rambled enough.  Again, don't expect any book to perfectly describe your parenting situation, and don't read a book expecting that you'll be able to perfectly follow what it describes.  If you take advice as a general guideline rather than a mandatory requirement, this book offers good advice.
B000002KDO|5.0|Few albums have managed to have such an overlaying sense of doom as projected by this metal classic. The only other album that even matches it's depression is \\"Damaged\\" by Black Flag. You can talk all you want about the self-titled and \\"Parinoid\\", this shall always be Sabbath's best album, and their last truly great one. If \\"Parinoid\\" set up the sound and groundwork for Sabbath and pretty much all metal to come after, \\"Master of Reality\\" perfected that sound. Sabbath invented metal, plain and simple. I know Zepplin, Cream, Blue Cheer all had albums before them, but Sabbath brought everything together. The album has a certain flow that manages to make it sound like something new with every listen. All the songs are the best Sabbath ever did, making this the best Sabbath album by miles and miles. The third greatest metal album ever (after \\"Master of Puppets\\" and \\"Reign In Blood\\"), making the first three studio Sabbath albums essential building blocks in the perfect metal collection.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|But then I was listening to it with a friend of mine and midway through the album he was about to cry. I asked him what was wrong, and he asked me \\"You know the twelve step program right?\\" Now, for those of you who don't know what this is, the twelve step program is a type of spiritual rehab that goes through twelve steps of recovery. He told this to me and explained that he had went through the program and he could relate to every song on here because of that. Thats when I realised what the album name meant \\"Thirteenth Step\\". <br /> <br />So I go home and I listened to it again the whole way through, and, knowing what I now knew, I wass truly moved by the album. Every one of the 12 songs represents one of the steps and here they are: <br /> <br />Step 1. The Package: 10/10: The intro describes the person befor he got into the program. It tells about taking my package, don't need another friend, taking whats mine, lie to get what I want, etc etc. Describing how much he relies on the drugs and how he would lie and what he would do to get \\"the package\\". <br /> <br />Step 2. Weak and Powerless 10/10: Now the addict is realising that he needs help with his addiction and is describing why its so difficult and that he feels \\"week and powerless. <br /> <br />Step 3. The Noose:10/10: At one point in the program you must go to people you know and talk to them about how your addiction has affected them. This song describes how the addict has to deal with the people he has harmed and even killed becaue of the addiction. <br /> <br />Step 4. Blue:10/10: Now he is describing how he saw the people he loved where suffering and he acted like they were fine and 'didn't want to know/keeping it in the dark/ignore the smoke/turning blue/I just sit and stare at you/ because I dont wanna know' <br /> <br />Step 5. Vanishing 8/10: At this point he is describing what it was like to be high on the drug and is looking back on it and missing the high 'disapear/ higher, higher/ into the air' <br /> <br />Step 6. A Stranger 8/10: This is someone who is unable to forgive the addict of all the pain he has caused and is acting like he/she doesnt know him 'You're just a stranger so what do I care' <br /> <br />Step 7. The Outsider 10/10: This is from the perspective of someone who doesn't know what its like to be an addict and is just like \\"Quit being such a baby and walk it off!\\" and acts like this person just wants attention and is threatening to commit suicide cuz he's weak. 'If you choose to pull the trigger/should your drama prove sincere/Do it somewhere far away from here' <br /> <br />Step 8. Crimes 4/10: Now the addict is recalling all of the crimes he has commited and is haing trouble finishing because of all the guilt '1...2...3...4...5...6...7...8...9...9...10...10...10...10' <br /> <br />Step 9. The Nurse who Loved me (cover) 7/10: Now the person is in rehab and is being delusional about a nurse who is helping him through the treatment and believes she is falling for him and is giving him shortcuts 'she has everything I need/pharmasy keyes'. <br /> <br />Step 10. Pet 10/10: This is from the perspective of the addiction and it is trying to get the addict back to his old ways and is trying to make him believe that the addiction is his only friend, the ony thing he can trust and love 'Pay no mind what other voices say/They don't care about you, like I do/Safe from pain and truth and choice and other poison devils/See, they don't give a f**k about you, like I do.' <br /> <br />Step 11. Lullaby 5/10: Now the addiction is taking controle and the addict is getting ready to back to his old ways <br /> <br />Step 12. Gravity 10/10: The addict finally realises that he needs help through his addiction and get rid of the pain forever <br /> <br />Overall: 102/120: about 92% As you can see, this is a very powerful album. However I must warn thee fans of tool; This is a lot more mellow than Tool. The only truely heavy songs here are 'Weak & Powerless', 'The Outsider', and 'Pet' and even they have their quiet moments. But keep in mind as well that these are exelent musicians and this band should not be overlooked. Thank you
B00000J7A2|5.0|If rock 'n' roll had a Salvador Dali, it was truly Van Vliet, better known as Captain Beefheart. While critics like \\"Trout Mask Replica\\" more, I prefer this insane and surrealistic reinterpretation of the delta blues genre (Howlin' Wolf in particular). What may be written off as a gimic works incredibly however. Vliet treats the subject not as a camoy joke, but a tribute. He sings with his soul, and the guitar work is incredible. Definatly more accessible than anything that was to follow this incredible debut. The love child of the aforementioned Howlin' Wolf and Frank Zappa (who was great freinds with the Captain himself).
0767834739|5.0|this movie is an awesoem movie.... i wont go into what happens because it is covered in other reviews.....but if you go into a ZOMBIE movie thinking that this is going to be a highly thought out practical movie you are a RETARD...... this movie has tons of action sexy people and a fun plot line..... if you want a movie that has action this is it
B000001FMX|5.0|The ultimate glam rock album, showing the sleaziness and appreciation of rock 'n' roll roots that made the genre so popular. Just when the Stones stopped being good, the Dolls came along and played Chuck Berry and Little Richard inspired rock 'n' roll that changed rock forever. Songs such as \\"Personality Crisis\\" and \\"Trash\\" perfectly show just why the Dolls are one of the best rock 'n' roll bands of all time. IT doesn't sound as great as it did on the first listen (the only minor criticism), but is still a must buy for the ultimate punk collection.
B00003CXAY|2.0|Kee-Yawn-A-SQUAT-See     <br /> <br />This movie was ok, a little overburdened with trying to make a statement rather than just shoot a great film.  The creator of the film was a bit pompous in my opinion.  I could barely sit through his interview.  If you really want to see a spectacular film WATCH BARAKA!
B000002G7E|5.0|... Lou Reed and the Velvet Underground could not make a bad album. Even a lesser album such as \\"Loaded\\" is better than 99% of all other music (even more so than that percentage actually). Without Andy Warhol and Nico, Lou Reed decided to go back to his original dream: being a garage rock 'n' roll band. However, they were just too much of a group of great musicians to be just another garage rock band. Stripped of the arty pretentions, they hammered out some well-crafter but still hard rock 'n' roll tunes. The highlight of this album is by far the last track, the legendary \\"Sister Ray\\". The single greatest song over ten minutes. The art of improvisisation has so rarely been captured in a peice of music, rivaling even \\"Kind of Blue\\". After \\"VU & Nico\\", this is the essential VU album. P.S. People say the Velvets couldn't make a good album without Andy Warhol's guidence. Warhol offered no guidence to the band, the Velvets just realized that he was the only man who would produce their album without interfering to make the lyrics safe and radio-friendly.
B0001Z37HM|2.0|Apparently the producers originally were going to have Arnold portray Conan again but decided against it as they thought people would get the impression that he would be the main character and be disappointed with the film. Boy were they wrong! Even changing his name to Kalidor couldn't save the audiences from being disappointed. The producers first major fault was hiring director Richard Fleischer to direct as he graced us with the ultimatly disappointing Conan the Destroyer. He actually manages to make a worse movie with Red Sonja. The second major fault was hiring actress Brigitte Nielsen. Yes she had the build for a warrior women, but she was, and is, a terrible actress. I still enjoyed some of the picture in a B-movie way, but overall this was sorely disappointing even compared to Conan the Destroyer.
0316777722|3.0|I can't deny that this book is really funny, I got hooked from the first page reading about his speech problem but after several chapters, I lost interest, it is really hilarious to read about his family, but then the comic mood didn't satisfy me as a reader wanting more essence to his novel. It became a narration of a gay 40 something male and his wretched life, from drugs, failure in school, living in Paris with his boyfriend and really nothing substantial. Even when he talks about his family and how weird they are, you laugh hard, but then he leaves it as an open window for you to comment. You wonder what made him lead such a life, his parents? the way he grew up?<br /><br />The writing is easy and smooth. You feel sometimes as if he is actually talking to you which makes it a fun read.
0790729628|4.0|Blade Runner is one of the most influencial Science Fiction movies ever made. Sci-Fi story telling and movie making have not been the same since; can you even imagine a 'future' unlike the one depicted in this movie? The DVD transfer is adequate(but should only be watched in widescreen format).  The Directors Cut is the version to watch. Thank goodness the ridiculous narrative has been removed (a last minute add-on for it's theatrical release in '82). The added 'unicorn' dream sequence (although quick) fuels the debate over whether Deckard (Harrison Ford) is an replicant himself and pays slight homage to the original title of the book it is based on: \\"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep\\".  <BR>The DVD however could use some more extras. A 'behind the scenes' section or a 'deleted scenes' section would've been nice; interviews with the cast would've been great. However, all it has is spanish/english options and a chapter index.
B00005JNEI|4.0|This is a good move if you are looking to laugh at the man with no plan George Dubbyaa.  But i think it was a little too one sided, like fox news--Loaded junk, but unlike fox news this junk is funny.  See it, laugh and enjoy but dont think it all as said.  its a movie not a history book, and it does not give all sides of the story. Even if you are for Bush you must see it, its a funny movie.
B000002USN|5.0|Don't be fooled by the negative reviews of this Sinatra masterpiece.  No, it doesn't rival his at-his-vocal peak work from the fifties and sixties.  And yes, Sinatra's voice is a little ragged around the edges, but that only makes you appreciate the sheer genius of the man.  Sinatra's body of work evolved - just as his voice did.  He wasn't afraid to experiment and take chances. \\"Watertown\\" is a great example.  And he wasn't afraid to record during the final years of his career with a voice that no longer was the exquisite instrument it had once been.  But not to have recorded this album would have robbed Sinatraphiles of a final opportunity to appreciate what a musical genius the man was, and what he could still do with a voice that was almost  eighty-years old.  The duets work - all of them.  Bennett, Minelli, Natalie Cole, and Luther Vandross are wonderful and complement Sinatra's artistry perfectly.  Tony Bennett's voice has a raspiness to it now, but he too is still a great vocalist, just like Sinatra.  I only wish that Barry Manilow and Engelbert Humperdinck could have been included somehow.  This is a final treasure that is like a rare, distilled aged scotch.  It is a conoisseur's delight and a unique one-of-a kind treasure that can never be replaced or equaled once it's gone.  And now that Sinatra is gone, we have the great good fortune of being able to compare and contrast his great body of work from start to finish, and believe me, the end is every bit as good as the beginning, and \\"Duets\\" is no exception. It puts an exclamation point on the legacy of the greatest vocalist of the 20th century.
B0001AP12G|3.0|This albums just alright. It was gassed way to hard by white cats. The beats save the album, but honestly i think he was nicer back in his Blueprint era. I'm really surprised he got all the grammy nods, especially since he's so racially biased. Also i can't believe any of the stuff he says about selling drugs, he's a clown... the only song i really like is we don't care and never let you down, but jay-z really makes that song....i guess people only say this is the album of the year cus all the others were whack, but i'd reccomend \\"Purple Haze\\" or \\"Street's Disciple\\" as album of the yr over this
B000059Z8M|5.0|\\"Toy Story 2\\" is a very rare movie ... in that it is a sequel that is better than the original.  There's a lot of fun here, but I think it is the emotional parts that push it a notch higher than its predecessor.<br /><br />In this story, Woody (a cowboy doll) is stolen by Al ... the evil toy store owner ... who plans to sell him to a toy museum in Japan.  Back in Andy's room (Andy is, of course, the boy who owns Woody) Buzz Lightyear (a spaceman doll and Woody's best friend) decides to go find Woody and bring him back home.  In the meantime, Woody, while being held captive, meets Jesse, a cowgirl doll ... and learns that he was once the star of his own TV show ... and a national icon.  Along the way of saving Woody before he is shipped to Japan a ... good-versus-evil situation ... emerges and the final outcome (of everything) is decided in a very exciting finish.<br /><br />There are two emotional parts:  Woody realizes that someday Andy will discard him.  Also there is Jesse's story.  Jesse relates to Woody (in a flashback) the story of her past ... the loving relationship she had with her owner (Emily) and the heartbreak of being herself discarded.  This is a gem of a scene ... so touching ... so easy to involve oneself in ... a privileged moment for us movie watchers ... and some very excellent work on the part of the movie makers.

B00005NTNM|3.0|is the basic premise of the third installment in the series.  THE ENFORCER tackles some mid-1970's issues, most notable women being indoctrinated into mainstream law enforcement and the front line men having to accept their presence.  The times they were changing, but Clint keeps Harry Callahan true to the old guard:  when in doubt, shoot.  Plenty of action in this nominal storyline about a group of west coast revolutionaries, who Harry discovers to be just a group of street thugs looking for easy money and piling up bodies along the way for their own enjoyment.  They meet with the rath of Callahan in predictable fashion.  But along the way, you get a first rate performance from Tyne Daley, solid work by Harry Guardino and some hysterical dialogue, whether it was intended to be that way or not.
B0006399FS|5.0|I never write reviews. I think they're useless. People browse through reviews until they find the opinion they're looking for. Needless to say, that opinion is exactly the one that matches their own. So why am I writing a review? Mainly, not to express my opinion, although I will in the end, but to put an end (yes, I'm this presumptuous) to some blatantly false affirmations that some people might have taken for facts. <br /> <br />The following is a list of stupid things/concepts I have come across while reading several reviews of U2's latest album from different sources: <br /> <br />- U2 need to retire. <br />This is one of the funniest. Which are the requirements for retirement? Maybe I'm not familiar with them, but I think that if you're currently one of the 30 best bands in the world (I've chosen a deliberately high number) when it comes down to put out new music, calling it quits seem a little bit out of place. <br /> <br />- U2 fans are mindless zombies. <br />It's been suggested that U2 fans would love everything from the band, even if it's crap. That they have no criterium and they're nothing but pathetic Bono worshippers. Some people think that U2 fans can't recognize quality. If somebody likes a song by U2 from the last four albums, it's not because the song may be good by itself, but because the band has tricked them into thinking it... <br />Good point. Very good point.  :p <br />All I have to say is that \\"All That You Can't Leave Behind\\" was a disappointment, for me, and I like this album better. <br /> <br />- U2 are fakers. <br />These days must be spiritual days. It's the only explanation I can come up with after seeing how many people is demanding Bono to lead an spartan life just because he happens to be concerned about the main social problems in the planet. \\"Mild\\" positions are not allowed: \\"live under a bridge or shut up\\" is the essence of what they don't like about Bono. Well, at least, he's trying, you morons. <br /> <br />- U2 are musicians,not politicians, so blah blah... <br />Ok, to the guys who think like this: if I ever see your house in flames, I won't do anything, because I'm not a fireman. <br /> <br />- U2 play it safe and live on their past. <br />For a band who has experimented so much and so successfully along the time, some respect is due. They could even release two more standard albums and this criticism would be unfair. And by the way, U2's two latest albums mark the beginning of a new sonic era, where songs are more important than sound. <br /> <br />And now, my opinion about the record (if anybody cares): <br /> <br />The most striking thing is that is one of the least accesible by U2. If you've listened to Vertigo (yes, you have) you will be wondering what the hell am I saying, but it's true. Every song takes more listens than usual. Even Vertigo, that seems a little bit silly and inoffensive at first, ends up revealing itself like a powerful rocker. Other tunes go through similar stages: \\"Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own\\" goes from formulaic to achingly beautiful, \\"All Because Of You\\" goes from filler to stomping rocker, \\"Crumbs From Your Table\\" goes from self-ripoff to new guitar ground exploration and \\"Yahweh\\" goes from a song with a rough chorus to a classic. <br /> <br />About the sound, it could be described as 35% Achtung Baby, 25% All That You Can't Leave Behind, 20% The Unforgettable Fire and 20% something new. Achtung Baby contributes mood and guitars, ATYCLB contributes his radio-friendly generic production, The Unforgettable Fire contributes some abstract sounds, and the new things, you'll have to find out for yourself. <br /> <br />I think the album has no weak moments. Maybe \\"Love And Peace Or Else\\". But you know how rewarding is a weak moment in a U2 record. <br /> <br />The only complaints are two: first, the production, that devoids the album of some personality, the result is not as disappointing as with ATYCLB, but it still shows; second, Bono's voice, it'sundeniable that it's getting raspier than ever. Remember that clear singing in 'Gloria'? Forget it, it's gone forever. <br /> <br />Song by song: <br /> <br />- Vertigo. (9,5). Be patient. It matters more than you think. I still haven't get tired of it. Oddly enough, it keeps growing on me. I think it should last longer, and that's a good sign. The riff is killer. Period. <br /> <br />- Miracle Drug (9,75). One of the gems. Except for the production, this one could have been in \\"Achtung Baby\\". The bit before the last chorus is, simply put, one of the best things U2 have ever written. <br /> <br />- Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own. (9,25). Another \\"Achtung Baby\\" reminiscent song. As calculated as heartfelt. It sticks with you, and includes a pair of lovely lines who will drive people crazy when performe live. <br /> <br />- Love And Peace Or Else. (7,75). Catchier than you may think at first listens, but it's lacking something I can't tell. Maybe a more defined chorus would have helped. It sounds like the missing link between 'Rattle And Hum' and 'Achtung Baby'. <br /> <br />- City Of Blinding Lights. (9). One of those songs you like too much at the first listen, suspecting it will wear thin soon. Although it doesn't happen, there's nothing like the first times with this one. <br /> <br />- All Because Of You. (8,75). One of the most rocking U2 songs ever. The fact that is a song by U2 is misleading. Listen to it carefully: this tune rocks more than 10 nu-metal bands put together. This is rock. <br /> <br />- A Man And A Woman. (9,5). It sounds like nothing U2 has written. It's not groundbreaking, but it's difficult to find an U2 song that relates to this. It's tender, well constructed, well sung and the verse is so good that is almost a chorus. <br /> <br />- Crumbs From Your Table. (8,75). Another \\"hard to love\\" song. At first listens it sounds like a B-Side, until you start noticing the guitar work beneath. It's a little bit acid. Great midtempo. A grower. <br /> <br />- One Step Closer (8). This feels like a \\"Zooropa\\" song. Although the chorus is very simple, the verse is very beautiful. Quiet in a very good way. <br /> <br />- Original Of The Species (9). Depending on the day, this song is the best in the album or the weakest. It's another \\"new ground\\" song. It grows, and grows, and grows, and grows. Everytime you think you've reached the chorus, you're wrong. I think I would have rated this song 10 if certain moments would have been cut. Could've been the best. <br /> <br />- Yahweh (9,75). Gorgeous, no matter what people say. It makes you love life. I'm an atheist, but after listening to this I feel like praying. It has a perfect closing quality, the one that makes you feel like playing the CD again. By the time Bono sings the \\"oh oh oh\\" near the end, the album comes full circle and you feel you haven't had enough. The chorus might sound annoying the first times. Be patient. <br /> <br />To sum it all up: U2 is a band that has gone through so many different eras that it's gathered an audience so big and diverse that each time is more difficult to keep it satisfied as a whole. One reviewer pointed the fact that this album, after hundreds of reviews, positive and negative, was the one with this web's lowest rate of the band, and that it was a clear indication of what to expect. Well, I think that it's an indication about the fact that U2's audience keeps growing and growing. And I haven't even talked about how cool is to hate U2 nowadays. <br /> <br />The only thing I can say is that I'm a critic U2 fan, and I recommend this album a lot.
B000053V7O|5.0|Let's face it, I'm a fan of jazz music.  This film just re-enforces my love for the genre.  The movie is an enbodiement of the life that jazz musicians in the 40's and 50's struggled with.  Shunned in their homeland, reviered in France and other areas of Europe who appreciated the music.  Dexter Gordon really was the title character. His acting was real. He spent time in Europe where he was appreciated and loved.  Many people in the United States never heard of him until this movie was released.  To me, Gordon should have won the Academy Award (Unfortunately, Paul Newman won it for a role that should have been given to him in 1961 for \\"The Hustler\\".).  The characters in the movie were also real.  Herbie Hancock, Oscar winner for the movie's soundtrack acts in the film as well as musicians that included Wayne Shorter, Freddie Hubbard and Ron Carter.  Director Martin Scorsese also gives a good performance.  This film makes me appreciate how wonderful jazz music is and how fortunate I lived in a time that the music was discovered.
B00006JLX4|5.0|The Pavement re-issues for Slanted And Enchanted and Crooken Rain, Crooked Rain are the only two re-issues I've acquired although I already own the original versions. But just take a look at what Luxe And Reduxe has to offer: B-sides. John Peel sessions. The underrated Watery Domestic EP. More Peel sessions. An entire live concert. Compilation tracks. Unreleased mixes. Matador went all out for this release, doing what re-issues should do, which is collect EVERYTHING. Some record labels would leave off a b-side or two to have consumers have to spend more money on one of the label's other projects (maybe a greatest hits record or some forgettable compilation), but Matador includes it all, even the relatively easy-to-find \\"Summer Babe\\" single, which appears on the still in-print Westing album. And all of this material is included at a reasonable price, unlike the excellent, but overpriced re-issues of Weezer's Blue Album, Sonic Youth's Dirty, and Jeff Buckley's Live At The Sin-e. New fans must own this, but even old Pavement fans need to invest in this re-release. It's everything a Pavement fan could want and then some.

0792833260|5.0|Raymond Babbitt(Dustin Hoffman) is what is called an \\"autistic savant\\". His brain does not function in the typical fashion. I must admit he is a superb mathemetician. He has difficulty communicating and learning. He is set in his own ways of acting,thinking,eating,sleeping,walking,talking,using the bathroom,you name it. Any sudden unprepared break from his daily routine and weekly rituals terrify Raymond. Raymond has a younger brother Charlie(Tom Cruise) who is a typical healthy human being. The Babbitt brothers' father passed away and when Charlie learns about the death,that's when he learned that he had an older brother. The Babbitts' mother died when Charlie was a toddler and Raymond was in his 20's. Charlie is bequeathed a vintage 1949 Buick Roadmaster convertible. That's what brought his relationship with his father to an end. Charlie tells his girlfriend Susanna(Valeria Golino) that when he was in high school,he took a car for a victory spin against his dad's authority. He brought home a report card with almost all A's. The father reported the car stolen,spitefully to teach his son a lesson. Charlie felt he deserved it although the car was his dad's pride and joy. Charlie and a few friends of his were arrested and all but Charlie were shortly bailed out of jail. So Charlie ended up leaving home and he never saw his dad again. Charlie also got prize-winning rosebushes. Raymond,who doesn't understand the concept of money,was left $3 million. Charlie does all he can to gain custody of his brother and get his rightful share of the monetary bequest($1.5 million). According to Dr. Bruner who's in charge of Wallbrook,Raymond's institution,says Raymond gets the best care there. Charlie felt Raymond would live his life civilly outside Wallbrook. When Charlie was a child,he was trying to pronounce his brother's name and it came out \\"rain man\\". During Raymond's temporary departure from Wallbrook,Charlie takes him to Las Vegas. They play blackjack and win a lot of money.They even receive a penthouse suite,complimentarily as a result of their winnings. At a diner one morning,after eating a pancake breakfast,Raymond immediately knew that 246 of 250 toothpicks fell out of a box onto the floor. \\"There's four left in the box.\\",the waitress says. Raymond even briefly drove the '49 Buick in one or two scenes. In one of the final scenes,a private hearing takes place regarding Raymond. Raymond can't decide whether to stay with Charlie or go back to Wallbrook. Director Barry Levinson plays Dr. Mardsen,who's in charge of Raymond's psychic evaluation program. Raymond kept saying,\\"Go back to Wallbrook with Charlie Babbitt\\". So Dr. Bruner took Raymond back to Wallbrook. This film was theatrically released on December 16,1988. It won three Oscars. Levinson took home a Best Director Oscar,Hoffman took home a Best Actor Oscar,and best screenplay. Other films directed by Levinson are GOOD MORNING VIETNAM,starring Robin Williams which was another Academy Award winner and TIN MEN. Cruise's previous megahits include TOP GUN and THE COLOR OF MONEY.

0385510454|5.0|After the last couple of books from mr. grisham that were good but not great seemed he maybe on the slide but this book shows he is back and this one is great. <br /> <br />Arthur Morgan is the outgoing president of the united states he lost the reelection by the biggest landslide in histroy it was almost a complete electoral sweep except for the state of alaska.  With his last hours in office he reveiws cases and friends for presidential pardons when they comes upon joel backman who is the ultimate picture of success  in washington dc and political circles. <br /> <br />Joel Backman ran a 200 person law firm that is not the biggest by washington dc standards but is the firm you come to for political clout with the firm being the picture of success with mr. backman earning a reported 10 million plus a year and charging a 5000 dollar fee just for the beginning meeting but this bought you as a magazine called him the second most powerful person in dc the tops in the lobbying field. <br /> <br />The controversy starts with the announcement of his pardon.Mr. backman had just spent the last 6 years in solitary confinement with 14 years left to go. When backman is approached about accepting the pardon with certain requirements with his decision expected in a couple of minutes he does not that there is arm twisting in the dark to get him released. <br /> <br />Back a few years there is three pakistani computer scientists with a pakistani government secret project to access a  indian satellite to monitor and possiblie manipuate. These three stumble upon a series of satellites that are linked together and are the most advanced known but who do they belong to? As they learn to use the system they write soft ware that jams the system which gives them control so they decide to make some money and lots of it. Through contacts they pay the 5000 dollar fee and meet with Joel Backman which proves deadly the three scientists are murdered and the law firm comes under indictment.  When one of bakmans associates ends up murdered/sucide he pleads guilty and goes into protective custody. <br /> <br />With CIA not knowing who is the owner of the satellite system is they want to release backman because they know it will only be a matter of time before he is killed and they will know who the satellite owner is.  <br /> <br />An so with Mr. Backmans release the action begins this is definitley fastpaced along the lines of The Firm or Pelican Brief.
B000002ILG|4.0|Seldom has a guitarist displayed such good taste, talent, emotion, technical expertise, fluidness, in a heavy rock album, like Vito Bratta did on this album.<br /><br />The licks are amazing, the solos breathtaking without shredding, the tones warm and hard at the same time! He even manages to make you forget about Mike Tramp's anemic, boring vocals.<br /><br />PRIDE is an album that has a deserved place in the history of eighties hard rock.
B0000AQVCL|5.0|I'm a 16 year old girl, going on 17 in a few months, and I have always listened to and loved oldies rock, and even modern rock.  Beatles, Rolling Stones, Led Zeppelin, Deep Purple, Pink Floyd, AC/DC, Aerosmith, Creedence Clearwater Revival, and the list goes on.  I'm very relieved that a band as great as Jet has hit the American scene.   <br /> <br />Some call their lyrics \\"trite\\" -- It's trite to add a few new words at the end of every few lines to keep a rhyme and rhythm going?  Hell, man, I guess that makes it all right for oldies rock bands to get away with, because they INVENTED music, right?  Wrong.  Music is ancient.  It's just ridiculous that anyone would accuse Jet of being rip-offs or sell-outs just because they've been influenced by the some of the classics.  Yeah, maybe they're music sounds similar to a lot of older songs, but where is the harm in that?   <br /> <br />It's really a shame to see how a person will rag on someone else for the sake of showing off their knowledge of what they define as \\"talent\\".  Can every person who has ever wanted to learn to read music and play an instrument play very well?  No.  Has every person that ever wanted to write a song with a melody that fits the mood the words seek to create, write one?  No.  Therefore, I see Jet as talented.  If you don't, then good for you, atleast you have an opinion.  But don't find excuses like \\"This song sounds just like one by Iggy Pop!\\", or \\"Just like AC/DC!\\" just to justify your reasons for putting their music down.  Surely, you could come up with something better than that.  Oh, wait, I suppose you can't. <br /> <br />I know Jet's mainstream, and I used to shun everything deemed mainstream because of the image it gave off.  I finally realized how retarded I was in doing so.  It doesn't matter if someone is influenced by another band, and they sound similar.  Similar is a result of being influenced and inspired by something, maybe even subconsciously.   <br /> <br />We don't know if Jetwas really TRYING to live up to any of these other bands' standards.  Maybe they just wrote and played what they grew up learning and loving.  Nothing more than that.  So yeah, I kinda find it offensive when this great band with a good combination of catchy modern/old rock, softer rock (Timothy, for example, which I find to be pretty), and more \\"original\\" sounding rock, such as \\"Lazy Gun\\", personally one of my favorites on the album, get knocked on for \\"stealing\\" someone elses' sound.   <br /> <br />Get this.  Music...yes, it's copyrighted.  But a sound in general?  Music doesn't really belong to anyone; not in the sense of creating a sound with the same instrument used by a former musician.  If it were that way with jazz/big band/swing, there would be anarchy. <br /> <br />In closing, Jet is an amazing band, and I appreciate this album being released in the U.S.A.  I'm so glad that when I have kids, and they think of the music from MY generation, Jet will be a part of it.
020530902X|4.0|The Elements of Style is a small book. It is short and to the point, packing enough heat to put a writer through the refining fire every time one picks it up. As Adler and Van Doren are to the critical reader: rambling on about the riches to be found in the considered word, Strunk and White are to writers: Dutch uncles taking us all to the woodshed and then placing us back on our feet to be about our dour business.<br /><br />If you want to be a better writer, pick up this book. Read a few pages. Put it into practice.<br /><br />Send yourself through the fire. Temper the blade of your pen. Remove the impurities from your work.<br /><br />Omit needless words.<br /><br />In that spirit, this book needs no further recommendation from me.

B00029LNHS|2.0|\\"Where Is The Love\\" is a great song.  \\"Let's Get It Started\\" is agreeable radio candy but it doesn't hold up to repeated listenings.  You get tired of it pretty fast.  It's mostly downhill from there.  I like albums to have a fair bit of stylistic and tempo variation to keep me interested.  I know this stuff is supposed to be cutting edge but it just gives me a headcahe.  BEPs should have waited until they had better material.  This album may have sold well but I'm betting their next one will tank.  People who bought this won't be going back to the well.

B000002KB8|5.0|It's not important that this album was nothing like anything before it.  What's important is that 35 years later it hasn't worn a bit.  What the kids are missing today with Linkin Park and that ilk is that metal was once fun to listen to.  This is heavy as heck, yes, but what keeps it vibrant 35 years on is that the melodies are great and there are hooks galore.  Ozzy's got to be one of the worst singers in rock history but with Sabbath it clicked.  It's interesting that this was reviled by critics when it was released and trashed in the first Rolling Stone record guide.  Now in the new third version of the RS guide it gets five stars.  It only took RS 35 years to figure out what millions of teenagers knew back in 1970.  By the way, one of my all time favorite album covers.
B000067J1H|5.0|Most of my friends loved the movie.  My father and my father-in-law both just called it 'wierd', my mother called it 'too violent'.  Still, the movie is able to work really well on several levels:<br /><br />First, the movie examines the character of the Narator and the schism of his personality.  Norton and Pitt are phenomenal.  Both are raising their acting stock with this film.  Generally the movie works well as a 'character piece'.<br /><br />Second, the movie has some great action, humor and gore.  This is a great movie for college-guys.  It may inspire folks to do bad things (that doesn't appear to be the goal of the movie), but great none the less.  The fights are well done, the general mayhem and sexuality are in line with this style of film.<br /><br />Finally, this is a pretty decent social commentary type of picture.  The ideology of the film: conformity v. anarchy is classic, but the movie definately brings some new thoughts to the table.<br /><br />Overall, the movie said a lot of fun, interesting, funny and scary things without confusing its message or its plot.  The characters were interesting.  The movie was great to look at, as well.  One criticism I've heard and agreed with the lack of development of Helena Bohnam Carter's character.  While I agree, the mystery of her character is somewhat essential to the plot.
B0002OERI0|4.0|I didn't think Green Day had this album in them.  It's as big a leap from Dookie to American Idiot as the Beatles' leap from Please Please Me to Abbey Road.  I can't honestly say I follow the whole storyline on this CD but with songs this catchy, who cares?  \\"American Idiot\\" get's things off to a roaring start although it harkens back to GD's more traditional punk style.  The next track \\"Jesus Of Suburbia: (great title or what?) is actually a suite of five short songs segued together and from there we know we're in for a very different Green Day experience. \\"Are We The Waiting\\" is incredibly anthemic - bound to be a highlight in concert.  And \\"Whatsername\\" is pure Beatlesque pop - would fit in on a Fountains Of Wayne CD.  Hats Off to Green Day for making angry music so much fun to listen to.  Instead of fading away into oblivion they've come up with an assured mature work that catapults then to the top of the punk/pop heap.  Definitely one of the best CDs of 2004 - although there wasn't a lot of competition.
0385510438|4.0|I think Mr. Grisham might have titled this novel before he wrote it, because the jury storyline is only a small part of the book. So, even though you're waiting for the jacket synopsis to come to pass all the way through this book, it's still an entertaining read.

B00005JMJ4|5.0|Do you think those reviewers who HATE HATE HATE this movie were expecting another Meatballs or Caddyshack?  I imagine that the movie company deserves some blame as they did sell this movie as a comedy.  I think it is an absolutely brilliant movie.  I have found that my friends who have travelled to the Far East and have encountered the culture shock displayed in the movie all like this movie.  I think it's easier to relate to the jetlag, culture shocked world in which the characters find themselves.  I certainly can understand how being dropped into an alien world would cause one to assess all their assumptions and find themselves lost as the characters do.      I think the ennui and the unresolved nature of the movie disturbs a lot of people.  Most movie goers seem to like a neat little story in which the protagonist changes and becomes a better person or the bad guy gets what's coming to them.  This movie is realistic to me because a) the old man DOESN'T sleep with the young girl. b) there is no SOLUTION for their problems (they are just able to console each other) c) their relationship is realistic because in their own society they would have nothing in common but here in Japan they are kindred souls.  Their relationship is of a transitory nature based on the situation and the place they are in their lives.
B000002C1W|4.0|Whatever you think of Roger Waters, Pink Floyd was clearly never the same after his rather acrimonious exit.  Having won the right to continue using the band's name, David Gilmour, Nick Mason, and Richard Wright recorded and released A Momentary Lapse of Reason in 1987.  It's a far cry from the incredibly successful concept albums largely controlled by Roger Waters (e.g., The Wall, Dark Side of the Moon), and it has its inherent imperfections, but A Momentary Lapse of Reason is still an impressive album featuring some great musical moments and awesome Gilmour guitar riffs.<br /><br />Freed from the controlling influences of Waters, David Gilmour dominates this album - he wrote or co-wrote every track, took up the mantle of lead singer, and did much to prove himself the greatest guitarist in the business.  One can read certain things in the album title and some of the songs (e.g., Sorrow) about the whole Pink Floyd turmoil of the previous years, but the main problem with this album is its seeming lack of a unifying theme.  There is unquestionably a great deal of intensity in the words and music, but there's no real depth.  To me, the whole album has an artificial feel to it - especially compared with the Waters-dominated Pink Floyd releases.  There are no bad songs on this album (although some Pink Floyd fans don't think very much of The Dogs of War), but few seem to work up any real emotion.  One can get a feel for this in the opening instrumental track; there may be Signs of Life in the initial sounds of plodding movement through water, but these are lost in a cacophony of artificial voices speaking unintelligibly in the background.  I have to admit that I don't always understand what Gilmour and the guys are trying to do in some of these songs.<br /><br />Learning to Fly is somewhat pop-oriented track that succeeds quite well, but the first real magic is to be found in the song On the Turning Away.  This track about man's lack of concern for his fellow man also features some amazing guitar work by Gilmour.  Gilmour's finger work basically carries the second half of the album, one rendered somewhat obscure by the long instrumental Terminal Frost and its musical A New Machine bookends.  The album closes out impressively, though, with Sorrow.  This is the most emotionally compelling song on the album, and it opens with David Gilmour doing what he does best.<br /><br />I can see how some Pink Floyd fans don't really care for this album.  It's very different from what had come before, and the song lyrics don't really compare to those written by Roger Waters.  Still, this is Pink Floyd - maybe not the Pink Floyd we wish we still had, but Pink Floyd nonetheless.  David Gilmour, Nick Mason, and Richard Wright revived this group when many thought it was dead and buried, and their own distinctive musical creations introduced a new generation of fans to the magic that is, was, and always will be Pink Floyd.amazing guitar work by Gilmour.

B000001ES9|3.0|Rush is such an accomplished band of consistent excellence that all of their work is viewed through the prism of their best moments. This is especially true of this, their first recording. The songs are basically solid, standard-issue 70's rock. Some songs, such as \\"In The Mood\\", \\"What You're Doing\\", and \\"Working Man\\" hold up remarkably well. \\"Here Again\\" is the closest Rush ever came to a straight blues song.  There is a heavy dose of Zeppelin-approved stomp all over the album, which was to be expected.  Led Zeppelin's influence towered over hard rock at that time, and many bands struggled to get out of their shadow, Rush included.  All of the songs are rather cliched lyrically, something that would be remedied with the introduction of Neil Peart to the group.  Lee's bass playing is servicable, as is Rutsey's drumming, but Liefson's guitar is raw and aggressive, plowing through most of the songs with energy and grit. This was servicable hard rock.  Better than a some of bands of that era, a cut below some of the better ones. An entertaining listen if you're in the right mood.

That totally did some of the best work <br />as \\"What It Is\\" did. I call Coyote, \\"The Desert Song\\" as it's nickname because that's a great road song for the desert. Especially in Arizona. This has been my favorite song all day today. I got this album for Christmas and my dad enjoys listening <br />to it. He likes more than one on that album and I only like one. <br />I'll tell you baby, please listen to this song and will make you <br />wanna listen to over n over! And one of my favorite songs to <br />both Heavy Fuel and Sweet Child of Mine. I also reccomend these <br />other items by Dire Straits/Mark Knopfler. <br /> <br />Sailing to Philadelphia <br />Shangri-La <br />Sultans of Swing/The Very Best of Dire Straits <br />On Every Street <br />Brothers in Arms <br />Making Movies <br />On The Night (Live) <br />
B0001611DI|5.0|And justifiably so.  Enough ink has been spilt about the social commentary subtext of this movie, so I won't add to it except to note that this film is a must for any complete horror collection.  Generally considered George Romero's masterpiece (and justifiably so), a modern viewer is likely to thing this movie isn't really scary ... until you think about it later.  Besides, who can dislike a movie with so many comically-inclined blue-faced extras in it?   <br /> <br />(For prospective viewers who enjoyed the remake released in 2004 and now hope to sample the original, be reassured that the plots of the two movies have little in common other than the basic \\"zombies, shopping mall\\" premise, and Romero's original will be a fresh surprise for you.) <br /> <br />The transfer to the DVD format is quite good, and the extras, though not dazzling, are quite entertaining.
B000002TQV|5.0|Ok, someone has to step in here.<br /><br />First of all, yes, \\"The Bends\\" is a great album (notice I gave it five stars)<br /><br />Having said that:<br /><br />Look, I know you guys care about the music and all, but really, no one who is checking some reviews on an album wants to read like 15,000 reviews that are each like 50 pages long and consist of a lot of overanalyzing of each and every track (\\"It's like he's...telling a story in this one..about like, peoples lives\\") but that really don't say ANYTHING.<br /><br />look, I'm a Radiohead fan, and this stuff makes me NOT want to listen to radiohead.<br /><br />And insulting your reader? i.e \\"If you don't like this track you are and idiot and have no taste in music!\\"<br /><br />Come on.<br /><br />Oh yeah, and in response to whoever wrote \\"The song 'The Bends' really swings\\"......uhhh, as a musician, I can assure you that is most certainly does not, becuase it has a \\"straight\\" eigth note beat....and not a \\"swung\\" eighth note beat.<br /><br />Nothin' but love
B000066F6H|4.0|I think it' fair to say this is a pretty good rock album. Some people dont like their style, but it pumps me up, its not punk its just solid rock I suggest if you like regular rock take a listen. Standout tracks: Walk Idiot Walk, Main Offender, Die All Right, and Knock Knock
0316172324|1.0|Gladwell's \\"Blink\\" tells us that we can learn as much in 2 seconds as we can from a detailed study. That summarizes his entire book. Spending any more time on his book will provide no greater insight.  Take his advice - accept this 2 second summary of his book, and move on. There is nothing more to learn from reading it. Apply this to Tipping Point's basic idea - if a phenomenon achieves a certain critical mass, it will grow exponentially. Now you don't need to read Tipping Point either.
B00005JLEX|4.0|Overall I love this item.  The only thing I wish it would have had is some outtakes from when they were taping these shows.  Other than that it's great.  You can watch each episode of the first two seasons of Seinfeld and also listen to and watch commentary about each episode.  You can turn on the Notes about Nothing feature before you watch an episode and notes about the show or the actors will come up throughout the episodes.  There is commentary from the producers and actors about most of the shows and also how they were hired.  You can also see Jerry's first time on the Tonight Show with Johnny Carson in the Special Features section along with a clip of Michael Richards on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno.  There are a few deleted scenes that you will find for some of the episodes.  Personally, I don't find them much different than the scenes they actually went with and the ones they went with are better than what they cut in my opinion.  All in all this is a great gift for the Seinfeld fan in your family or your heart.
B0002Z0EYK|3.0|Forgetting completely Homer, and just looking at the film and DVD, I have to confess to sheer disappointment.  The DVD extras are boring but interesting for the fact the emphasis on battle scenes as opposed to characters & casting displays how much the filmmaker wanted to sweep the dirt under the carpet.  If there's no focus on the actors and their characters, then the audience might put less emphasis on laughable miscasting (Brad Pitt - one of the producers - so that explains why his character is the \\"lead\\" and the attempt to turn the self-absorbed egotist Achilles into someone admirable) and weird focus on characters, such as Briseus, who is only there to prove to the audience how \\"lovable\\" Achilles is.  In the extras, there aren't even any deleted scenes!  All the bad cliches of epics are here, and also a blatant rip-off of Peter Jackson's RINGS films, when it comes to sweeping focus on battle scenes & vistas, as well as continued earnestness.  I would say this film is borderline camp, only it's not fun enough to qualify.  And, unfortunately, the battles are empty here, they don't seem to serve a purpose except to say \\"Hey, here's a battle.\\"  Since RINGS' battles tended toward the overlong, that's not altogether bad as it should give more time over into character.  However, the film does succeed on the eye candy basis, and to see the film for that alone, is actually the only reason to spend the time (or the money on the DVD).  Both Orlando Bloom as handsomest man Paris, and Sean Bean (both these guys RINGS alumni) as clever Odysseus - though he's underused and even physically faded a bit as he underwent a hair color change - are very suitable to their roles.  Diane Kruger is the blonde symmetrical perfection the Greeks would have revered as Helen.  Eric Bana's Hector is really the soul of the film, and consequently he has the best and most noble character, and to most people steals the film as Hector is the most sympathetic and competently played.  Interestingly,it is Paris who is the only character who has a true arc to play, as he starts as a foolish & romantic youth, to undergoing a change into responsible & honorable man, the kind of man and prince his brother Hector would respect (after a humiliating middle ground in the film).  The supporting parts are all well played, notably Brian Cox, who's in nearly every film made nowadays.  Indeed this was a nearly perfectly cast film, it is the execution by the screenplay and director that are at fault, where the emphasis is misplaced (and the unfortunate casting for Achilles and the exaggeration of that role).
B00025ETIW|5.0|This is a really decent album considering how mainstream it is now... Its a collection of songs that are well written, musically intelligent and they have guitar solos! The lead singer gerard is an awesome vocalist... his energy just blows everything away. These songs are upbeat and fast... and the slow ones are good too... Some songs have a really gloomy, dark edge that is very interesting, and almost all of them have catchy enough choruses to get stuck in your head for days... this is good stuff.. id never thought id say this.. but its good.
0446677450|5.0|This book provides a refreshing and different perspective on how to achieve financial independence. Too many people tell the same story: study hard, get good grades, get a good job, work hard, invest regularly in mutual funds, and over time (more like decades) you'll be able to retire comfortably. Well, if you follow typical advice you may be able to retire comfortably assuming you don't also get sucked into the debt that most Americans face. This book tells you how to avoid the rat-race and how-to develop an earning and investment strategy that allows you to achieve financial independence more quickly.  Our education system teaches kids lots of things but it doesn't teach them financial literacy - this book is a great first step.
B00000J7SS|5.0|...to any of the negative reviews that put this album down or the people behind it. They simply don't know what they are talking about. <br /> <br />First of all, Miles was not trying to get even with the pack. Davis never had a pack to begin with, so it's ridiculous to argue that guys like Coltrane were surpassing him, especially considering Davis never wanted to pursue that kind of direction. His second great quintet was famous for Miles' \\"freedom within form\\" approach, so Miles was not being stubborn to the avant-garde. AND, all of his 60s quintet albums hint further and further to the sound that prospered on this album. How someone can look at the hiring of Tony Williams for his rock-inspired drumming, the transition into electric instruments, and the move into longer, more ambitious tracks as all coincidence is beyond me. Davis knew what he was doing and what he was working towards, and this album is that crowning achievment. <br /> <br />It seems popular opinion of this album hasn't really changed. Critics attacked BB as a \\"series of long jams held together by endless grooves,\\" and to somebody who has put no time into research of the album will believe this. True, the songs are ridiculously long, but Miles didn't simply say to his producer Teo Macero \\"We're playing 6 jams over 3 days.\\" Yes, it does sound ridiculous! The album famously reads 'directions in music by miles davis' for a reason. The editing room was as much an instrument as anything, and Teo Macero as much a band member as anyone. The music you hear here was spliced and pasted to form what Miles was invisioning. They were not long jams that just meandered forever. They were carefully assembled suites. <br /> <br />Enough about the contruction though, what about the album itself? Well, this is really where the fans get divided. Many people have told me how the songs are \\"meandering, pointless, and long-winded.\\" The same can be said about John Coltrane's music. Is it true on either accounts? Of course not! Yeah, this music is long, and it does demand attention, but who said that's a bad thing? <br /> <br />The instrument combinations and musicians define the unique sound BB boasts. The title track alone features as many as 12 musicians at any given time. Just thinking of 12 professionals playing together brings thoughts of muddy, sloppy, and terrible music, but BB really is anything but. Like I stated earlier, Miles knew exactly what he was doing here. Listening to BB as a musical artifact and not a muddled mistake shows the listener what it truely is. A masterpiece in textures, sonics, and soundscapes. I read a review somewhere that defined it perfectly: this is an orgasm for your ears. <br /> <br />There will be of course people that read this review and think I'm totally wrong, which is perfectly fine. After my first couple listens to Bitches Brew, I would have been impatient enough to agree with them.
B00079FUI6|5.0|This show has it all - comedy, suspense, drama, romance ... this is the best written show in a such a long time.  The main 4 ladies along with Nicolette Sheridan bring so much to this show.  Even the minor characters, like Paul, Mike, are so good.  Can't wait for the DVD in August!
B0001LJC2K|5.0|I notice this band about two years ago and after that I have been so in love to MUSE that no one can't even imagine how much. Really =)  <br /> <br />Well, speaking about this CD,now I'm going to rate few songs in Absolution. <br /> <br />Time Is Running Out 10/10 : just one of the most brilliant song I ever heard. <br />Sing For Absolution 9/10 : it's beautiful...and.... <br />Stockholm Syndrome 9/10 : guitar...drums...voice..all affect each other. <br />Hysteria 10/10 : Simple and geate song...what else could I say??? <br />Falling Away With You 10/10 : oh...the words, words, words.... <br />Blackout 10/10 : again one of my favour song in this album. <br />Butterflies and Hurricanes: 11/10 : Brilliant so brilliant....piano...Matthew...all. I simply LOVE this song. <br />The Small Print 8/10 : First I..honestly didn't like at all this...but after I have been listening it again and again I have realised what does it mean....and...ok...it's OK =) <br />Endlessly 10/10 : The voice...... <br /> <br /> <br />All in all the whole album deserve by five stars!!!! <br />
B0006399FS|5.0|I actually rate this album 4.5 stars, but Amazon won't let me do that, so I'll be nice and round up. <br /> <br />This is an excellent album, from start to finish. The funny thing is, while \\"Vertigo\\" is the big hit from the album, it's actually one of my least favorite songs. It's fun to listen to, but that's about it. <br /> <br />Just like \\"All That You Can't Leave Behind\\" had the absolutely perfect song \\"Kite\\" (my favorite U2 song) that wasn't released as a single, this album also has a non-single gem - \\"City of Blinding Lights\\". The song starts out with one of the most beautiful inroductions I've heard, and then it moves on to brilliant, melodic, and catchy lyrics. This is certainly right up there near \\"Kite\\" on my favorite songs list. <br /> <br />Some other excellent songs on the album include \\"Sometimes You Can't Make It On Our Own\\", \\"Miracle Drug\\", \\"Original of the Species\\", \\"Love and Peace or Else\\", \\"One Step Closer\\", and \\"Yahweh\\". But every song on the album is certainly worth many listens - there isn't a single \\"skip\\" song. <br /> <br />Definitely worth the money for anyone who loves good rock 'n roll!
B00005YXZH|5.0|Amazing!  Finally, an album that captures and defines   the \\"sound\\" of post-modernism!  Tweedy and crew have created an original, and totally fresh, \\"american\\" classic.  It should be an essential part of any serious music-lover's library.  It's also a recording that demands repeated listenings!...pure poetry!  By mixing the roots of Americana, with the \\"sound\\"-of-today, the band succeeds in creating an album that's complex, and unusually rich in atmosphere.  To listen to this album is to take a journery through a chosen soundscape.  One where Jeff's melancholic-grace, and desperately heartfelt-vocals, is backed by an ever-changing, and always-evolving, musical landscape.  Yankee Hotel Foxtrot roars out of the subway like a strangely beautiful piece of post-modern art.  Wilco could be the next prophets of a new \\"lost-generation.\\"  Way to go guys!
B00006879E|5.0|Before I heard about this album I only had a taste in the alternative kind of music like Savage Garden, Matchbox 20, and Train which in their own respective kingdoms are very great but this one topped them all.  Funk/R
