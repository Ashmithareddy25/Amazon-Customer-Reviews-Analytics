B0001ADAVK|3.0|but I wasn't expecting much either.  Roberts is okay - she's Julia Roberts and I gues that is really the most you can ask of her anymore.  Thankfully the girls take center-stage here and ultimately keep us interested in another one of those teachers-as-heroes films.  Dunst is quite the effective bitch here and she really does make you want to give her a smack. I really like Stiles, but she seems so contrived in this role.  Gyllenhall and Godwin are great.  Visually appealling and with a killer soundtrack (worth getting) it's not a bad way to kill a couple of hours.

B00003CXCT|3.0|I have to say as a purist I would like to see the original version of The Star Wars Trilogy, released on dvd as well.  Maybe I am old-school, but I think the original version is the best.<br /><br />Those who want the enhanced version should get what they want as well.  So which ever version you like, make your vioces heard, and maybe the Star Wars Empire will listen.
B0000029GA|5.0|In his third album \\"I am,\\" Nas repudiates the moniker 'Nasty\\" on the song \\"Nas is like\\"  that he flowed with in \\"illmatic\\", because as he puts it, \\"those hardcore days were signs of pain\\". Illmatic, his musical 'IPO'  has hardcore as its foundation and pain its building blocks. It's laced with the usual blights that plague America's inner cities, drugs, drive-bys, harassment by the boys in blue, just to mention a few. The beats are dope and production is tight. His strongest point, however, is his lyrical flow. In \\"World is yours\\", he spits ...\\"I'm out for dead presidents to represent me / i keep falling but not falling six feet deep.\\"  \\"It ain't hard to tell\\" keeps it consistent \\"... It ain't hard to tell, i excel and maintain, the mic's contacted i attract clientele.\\"  Other tracks to make you nod your head include\\"Halftime\\" and \\"Memory lane\\".Nasty Nas keeps it real ghetto and gritty, and illmatic's 10 bangin tracks delivered via sweet hooks are a good starting point if you want to trace the evolution from Nasty Nas to God's Son.
B00003CXCT|3.0|and include both the new and original versions of each film in this package.  Ok, so Lucas wants to digitally change some shots.. he's entitled.  But why exclude the lovers of the original and untouched versions?  Personally I'd be a lot more open to these changes that are being made if I had the opporunity to own both versions.  Being forced to have only the newly doctored movies doesn't make me happy.   <br /> <br />Why is Lucas so insecure about the originals?  Was the fact that they made millions of dollars or are revered as the most popular movies of all time not enough?  What if Hollywood went back and digitally touched up \\"Gone With The Wind\\" or \\"The Godfather?\\"  It would be an obomination.  So just because this is a movie involving space and technology it becomes open season?  Better yet, why not have the French make a new face for the Statue of Liberty?  They can do better right?  (note the sarcasm here)
B000084T18|5.0|First of all some of the reviews for this cd are indeed not true. People are jealous because 50 Cent is in the spotlight. These reviewers apparently never heard 50 cent's underground cd's which are excellent, especially Guess Who's Back. Get Rich or Die Tryin' is more of a mainstream album, but 50 still flows well on the cd. The production on this cd is above average. All of the songs on this cd are nearly perfect. I don't have to skip over any of them on the cd. I also respect and listen to different types of rap music whether it would be 50, The Roots, or Missy Elliott. The fact of the matter is 50 is real hip-hop, despite what these other reviewers think. Get Rich or Die Tryin' is pretty close to a classic cd. Excellent Debut album essentially from 50 cent, even though he has but out underground cds like Guess Who's Back and Power of the Dollar. I know I certainly can't wait for 50's next cd due out this fall. <br />
B0002VEXUA|5.0|I'm a huge Oasis fan. I own just about all of the music they have released and I'm very proud to say that. This DVD is a perfect addition to what I own and this is a must own for all Oasis fans. <br /> <br />When Oasis busted out in 1994 they were a warm welcome to rock n roll. The depressing grung scene had gone on for way to long and this all gave these guys from Manchester the perfect chance to be the biggest band in the world. <br /> <br />This DVD is different from all of the other Oasis DVD's. The others are basicly just a recorded concert with little specials except for ....There and Then. Definetly Maybe is much more than just a concert with a couple of interviews. <br /> <br />You have the option to just listen to the songs. All of the songs from the album are here including the Sad Song which had previously only been available on singles, vinyl, and some of the U.K. versions. The music sounds great and is crystal clear. <br /> <br />You also have the option of watching a performance of each song. Some songs are from different concerts while others are from promo shows at different studios. All are great performances and are fun to watch. Most are shot with a British audience and it's funny to relieve some moments from 1994 while watching them.  <br /> <br />There also an option to get a documentary on each song. All 12 songs are special in their own right and it's nice to hear the band talk about them and especially Noel who wrote them. This guy is a musical genius and is one of the top song writers in the world. <br /> <br />All the original promos from the album are here. There are some alternate videos included as well. There are some directors commentaries that really equal out to some special stuff. <br /> <br />The band and producers have really put together a special DVD here. I'm on the Oasis maling list and alomst a year ago I got an e-mail asking for old pictures or recordings of the band from the Definetly Maybe era. They said they were workingon making a DVD and wanted to make it special. They really have done that. <br /> <br />If your a serious Oasis fan this is a must own. This is the greatest band in the world at their earliest stages. This album is what Rock N Roll is about. If you like this band or this album you wont regret buying this.
B000006TRV|5.0|Pink Floyd's \\"The Wall\\", is one of there best albums.  I read a book about the band a couple years ago, and the album \\"The Wall\\" was rated the top five best albums the group made. If you listen to the radio, a lot of songs from \\"The Wall\\", they play on the radio. The songs on the album are amazing. They are very upbeat and great guitar solos. My personal favorite song is \\"Another Brick in Wall Part 2\\". The sound effects that they have in the song and the story they are telling, is just great. I would recommend this CD to all Pink Floyd fans.  If you liked \\"Dark Side of The Moon\\", than you would like listening to \\"The Wall\\".
0780620003|5.0|I like it its just that why would a little fat clown (Violater) turn into a giant beast? But the SFX are cool. I just think it would be cool if there were bigger explosions. It sucked that they didn't make another one.
B0000A02TZ|1.0|Let me tell you one thing about France. Most of your great movies are also famous here as most French people love American movies. So I was surprised when I heard from that movie while staying in your country whereas I had never heard from it back in France. I thought I should give it a try. I was expected a funny movie, maybe a little dated but a good funny one such as Porky's ( also famous in France ) <br />or Revenge of the nerd. The DVD came out a few days ago for a cheap price so I bought it. I am so disappointed! and confused! Why would anybody consider this movie a classic? I now understand why it was not released in France. They knew it would be a flop. Don't get me wrong, I like crazy humor but this so dumb. A few scenes are funny but most of the movie is boring. If this movie came out today for the first time, nobody would really pay attention to this joke. If you have never seen it, you should rent it first. You will thank later.
B00008EY63|5.0|A cool movie that that I thought was better then Spider-Man 1. I read that they might make a #2. It will have the same person that plays Hellboy. I just hope it comes out by 2005.
020161622X|5.0|This is the best text ever produced for a junior software developer.  It touches on the value of almost all current developments in the software creation process and technology and most importantly, why they are valuable.  It does not provide the details of any specific technology but instead describes the theory behind why a practice or current technology is popular/good.  This allows the intelligent reader to apply the principle to a broad range of situations instead of one aspect of computing.  Not suprizingly, the authors advocate writting code that fits that discription as well.
0060930187|4.0|&lt;u>The Bell Jar&lt;/u> is a novel that follows the protagonist's insecurities to the point of mental breakdown and treatment. A book specific to the time period of the `50s, it's easy to see why &lt;u>The Bell Jar&lt;/u> is considered a classic American novel, showing promise to modern literature. Not knowing that Sylvia Plath wrote this book in the late `50s and early `60s, one could guess that the novel was composed in the year 2004. The vernacular is plain and doesn't over-achieve the standards of comprehension, the way older books sometimes seem to do. With themes of suicide and mental instability, Plath does a terrific job of staying realistic instead of writing in an overemotional, \\"teenaged\\" way- which is what I liked most, being 16 and not proud of the irrational way teens think. Esther, the protagonist, is mature and logical in her struggles. <br /> <br />As to not summarize the book, in short, &lt;u>The Bell Jar&lt;/u> is a perfect example of an understandable, personal American classic. Acting as one of the stepping stones to modern literature, Plath's autobiographical fiction is a work of art you wont forget.
B00003CXCT|5.0|So it was true after all...  Lucas WAS correcting his special editions, despite all the claims that it was just an urban legend.    A lot of people were disappointed that the DVD versions are just the special editions with a little spit shine on them, but I didn't mind.  Personally, I don't blame Lucas for wanting to erase the orange blob under the hover car or enhancing visuals which were limited by pre-digital blue-screen technology.  Yes, there were unwelcome changes.  The Jabba scene.  The new Sy Snootles song.  These are bad, but they don't detract from the overall experience.    Incidentally, the Jabba scene in Episode IV has been re-re-edited, and it's now much better.  Still sloppy, but better.  Han still steps on his tail, though, and watch for Chewie to enter the docking bay twice.  Other more subtle changes have been made, but you probably won't notice them unless you really study them.  You will, however, notice that Hayden Christensen now appears next to Yoda and Alec Guiness at the end of Return Of The Jedi.  To call it a controversial change would be an understatement.
B0001MDP3G|3.0|Civil War yarn longs to be epic in scope but remains an elaborate love story with Nicole Kidman waiting on new-found beau Jude Law to return from the war. The early battle scenes exhibit an authentic air and a scene with deserters being stung in a house of prostitution gives the film an unexpected horrific edge. The film's resolution, although intense, seems off-hand and pointless. The movie seems intent on avoiding a happy ending.
0385512104|5.0|I hadn't heard about this book when I innocently picked it up and started thumbing through it at the bookstore. After reading a few pages, I knew I had to buy it and I finished it in half a day because I simply could not put it down.<br /><br />The narrator of the story is a 15-year-old (presumably autistic and obviously precocious) boy who lives in working-class England and embarks upon the task of solving the mysterious murder of a neighborhood dog. The most outstanding part of the novel is the narrator himself. Haddon brilliantly endows his narrator with unconventional powers of observation and yet the character of the narrator comes across as a real person rather than as a literary device created by the author.<br /><br />The book is a satisfying read and I would highly recommend it to everyone. In fact, I would have given it to my 9-year-old daughter but for the fact that the language is somewhat too coarse in parts (the adults are almost universally foul-mouthed, but the narrator never is). For adults, however, I cannot but give this book my highest recommendation.<br /><br />Jeremy W. Forstadt
B0001HAISG|4.0|Very faithful adaptation of the J.M. Barrie children's classic novel should delight kids, indeed should inspire them to read the book, but adults may find the film lacking an identity of it's own. The performances, altough fine enough, seem generic like a cartoon, save Lynn Redgrave who does so much with a small role as the kid's London aunt. The flying scenes were rather unspectacular but overall this is a worthy adaptation of the book.
B00003CXCT|1.0|I came to amazon to check out the reviews for the \\"Special\\" (as in you're not stupid, you're \\"special\\") DVD edition of Star Wars, and lo and behold there are over 1000 in only a couple of days, most of them not so flattering. Eegads George, the peasants are revolting! Exclamations aside, I must say that there should be laws stopping egomaniacal over-the-hill directors from changing their past work, Spielberg, Lucas and Copolla (a la Apocalypse Now Redux) have all gone down that slippery slope, but none as gone so far and landed on their ass so hard as Darth Lucas. Perhaps when Lucas's children grow up, they will realise what daddy has done and say \\"Father, save them!\\" Until that day we are stuck with these sorry-assed CG'ed to death mutilations of pieces of art that have thrilled more teenage boys than Britney Spears in a tight sweater.  <br /> <br />Everyone has written about the horrible changes that the swollen comprimising puffy faced tyrant has made, Greedo shooting first (what's wrong with Han shooting first, Greedo is a bounty hunter for pete's sake, he's not there to sell him life insurance!) the HORRIBLE CG'ed Jaba, the disneyification of the whole goddamn series into an extremely long and tedious toy/video game commercial. And yes, these criticisms ARE valid on a review of this product, the whole point of which is to decide whether you want to buy the damn thing. And I say, geeks of the world revolt! You have nothing to lose but your cookies! After all, who else would buy these things anyway? The only way we can send the message to George that these changes were an afront to all the that is good and holy in this world is to boycott them. Your dollar is the most powerful force for change! If you must have a digital version of the movies, buy the original VHS tapes off of ebay and transfer them. Help us oh consumer with disposable income, you're our only hope!
B00003CXCT|1.0|Original Trilogy Please. <br /> <br />This is retarded - all of you people talking about how it's good for him to \\"update\\" the films, \\"fix\\" things, I've even seen a couple reviewers refer to the films as having \\"bugs and glitches\\"... <br /> <br />THESE AREN'T VIDEO GAMES, THEY DON'T NEED FIXES! <br /> <br />Films are works of art, they don't need to be \\"fixed\\". <br /> <br />You don't see anyone going back to the Mona Lisa going \\"Hmm... I wonder if we should update this old painting... you know... make her look more modern and sexy?\\" Leave it alone! <br /> <br /> <br />Lucas - do the right thing for once and give us the Original Trilogy... the demand is here.
B00003CXCT|3.0|When the 'Special Edition' trilogy came out in '97, I was very glad to see all 3 Star wars movies on big screen again.  However, like many people said, I wanted to see them as they used to be.  Some of the changes were acceptable, yes, but some were just plain stupid and I should say, unnecessary.  For example, the Wumpa cave.  In the original ESB, Luke only chopped off the monster's arm, so we never know if the monster survived or not.  But in special ed, you know he's dead.  Well, if the monster's dead, why did luke ever to bother getting out of the cave?  Why wouldn't he stay there to avoid snow storm? <br />Anyhow, that's just an example. <br /> <br />What I want to say here is 'Special Edition' should have kept 'Special.'  Now the DVD comes out, it becomes totally 'finished and permanent' edition. <br />Well, Lucas is a bussiness man, so I'm sure he'll release the 'original' trilogy in a few years. <br /> <br />But you know, Star Wars fans always love Star Wars.  Like myself.   <br /> <br />I'd give the set 2 less star for not including the original edition.
B0002IQNAG|5.0|I was allways a Day of the Dead fan still is my favorite out the series but having seen the first edition of Dawn earlier this year for the 1st time in allmost ten years I couldnt beleive how well it has withstood the test of time.<br />I knew then that a box set was coming so I waited and waited and I have to say it is by far the most complete no frills deluxe edition in my collection.<br />Ok I know that some of the make-up fx and dialouge are a bit dated but the overall integrity all around is solid.<br />The documentries and poster and image galleries and not to mention the crisp quality of the picture and sound are rich and fascinating to watch.<br />I have only watched the extended version there are two others one edited by Dario Argento and the other is Romeros original theatrical version.<br />This is zombie geek-dom at its finest!!!!<br />By the way even though Romero himself had nothing to do with the Dawn remake I still was blown away at the direction they took his vision.
B00005BF9Z|5.0|all I have to say is that listening to this cd gives me goosebumps because both musically and lyrically it has so much to say. manu proves you don't have to be blatantly commercial to write a catchy, successful tune. you just need to talk to people's souls, and he does.  <br /> <br />a lesson many artists should learn...

B000002LND|5.0|This cd is an awesome cd because it combines all of Madonna's greatest hits. Anyone that is a fan of Madonna is sure to love this cd! Also for anyone that has never listened to any of Madonna's music, this would be a great choice because it offers many great titles that explore her career. It's great when a cd combines songs that have been popular that everyone loves because instead of having many cds you can just pop in one. If someone wanted a cd to explain the past decade or so, this would be it. Madonna has been a public icon for so long and throughout our changing times Madonna has reinvented herself to provide amazing music. The music that Madonna has created can express any emotion and is sure to put a smile on your face!
1878424319|5.0|Happened to pick this up while on the CA coast on vacation and ran through it like a hot knife through butter. Excellent! This is a short (what 110 pages?) book that is simple and easily executable. Ruiz prsents four essential ideas that when employed can change one's view on life and one's approach to it as well. There are several companion books, including a fine one on \\"Knowlege\\", as Ruiz defines it. Thess books are New Age, but more tangible than many. Worth a viewing.
1401300901|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book because it wasn't too heavy-going and it was humourous. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants something to take their mind off the real world.  <br />I found it a definate page turner and it stimulated my mind <br />Very good, excellent waiting for the next one already!
B0001HAHXW|5.0|Hey folks, the blues can be fun too!  Rather than try to pretend to be something he's not, Eric brings a lighter touch to otherwise heavy blues tunes.  He pays tribute to Mr J in a style that's clean and modern...blues doesn't have to be down and dirty...especially with some of the fun lyrics that Robert Johnson penned.  To complain that this recording sounds too clean for the blues makes is sound like only scratchy 78s can reproduce the 'real' blues...phooey.  Sure, it's not the down-home angry sound of Big Joe Williams, but Eric and his boys are having fun and that's good enough for me.  So play this album a couple of times and you may find that it grows on you the way it has on me.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Britney Spears latest Cd 'In The Zone' is her best yet.  With this Cd she decided to let everything on the line and describe what she is going through and how she is changing it.  Throughout the Cd she dedcribes her battles with the musical world, boyfriends, herself, and being a pop icon.  I really enjoy listening to this Cd because it fills me with an upbeat lifestyle, yet it makes me think about how her life is not always that fabulous.  'In The Zone' was her first Cd after leaving the pop world for a couple of months.  In my opinion, she has come back with a bang!  Hopefully you will all try out her new Cd because it is different from what she normally writes.
B00003CXCT|3.0|Classic movies shouldn't be changed. A movie moves beyond just a way to kill some time, it becomes an experiance, something that your mind thinks back to and finds comfort in. I think for some 15 year old to come along and say people shouldn't take Lucas's changes as sort of a slap in the face to the die hard fans are ignorant to what this trully ment at the time it came out. It was the most advanced looking film to come out at that time, the top of the effects ladder at that point. I think to change it in an attempt to add footage to fit the prequals is an attempt at forcing them to tie into each other. Rather then changing the prequals story so that the continuity works, he is taking the lazy approuch, by simply adding in at post. I can see if he released a Speacial Editions version, and an Original, but like George Lucas loves to do, it is being forced onto people. Do I think these scenes will take away from the enjoyment of the originals, I do not thing so. I would like you to take this into consideration before you slam old timers for being upset over the changes and imagin that someday maybe a movie you ultimately find amazing is changed for no other reason then the whim of a director.
B00003CXCT|1.0|I'm not a \\"Star Wars\\" fan, but I grew up with these films (saw the 1st, or rather the 4th, at a drive-in when I was four).  I DO think it's silly to re-do a film like Lucas has, but that's a secondary issue at best.  The \\"special edition\\" versions just aren't what I remember.  So special effects are better now than they were thirty years ago... DUH.  And BIG DEAL: it's all done by computers and for the most part aren't any more eye-fooling than the clunky old creative approches.  Many people just want nostalgia, which is one thing these discs don't offer.  Thankfully, my dad has the originals on VHS.  So I won't be able to blast them on some monstrously oversized and overequipped televison.  At least through them I can return to the innocence and youthful adventure that the films once represented.  Try getting THAT from technology.    P.S. Anthony Daniels \\"admits director George Lucas' fascination with special effects had overtaken storytelling in later films,\\" according to Reuters.  The character and story-driven films are what really made the original Star Wars films \\"special,\\" not the visual effects.
B000002BPS|4.0|I am not a hug fan of the Offspring anymore but i do believe this is probably their best album. It was a fantastic major label debut which didn't really have the sales that the label probably hoped and not the hits they probably figured the Offspring could produce. this is a real dark and interesting album and musically it sounds a little more mature than Smash but not too much. This is the most mature and consistent the Offspring have ever sounded. I think that if you're getting into thwe offspring this is a must but start with ignition and smash first and stop at ixnay which is their last stab at anything good.
6305327041|5.0|love it or hate it four rooms is a fun movie. not every movie is gonna be a citizen kane. lets not forget this movie is a comedy, and on that level it suceeds. tim roth gives a great performance as ted the bell hop, a quirky man who gets frustrated after a series of mishaps that happen on his first night. the first segment finds ted at the begging of a coven of lesbian witches. mildly amusing, but i wouldn't consider it hilarious. the second segment, by far the worst of the four, finds ted at the mercy of a gun yielding husband whose wife is tied to a chair. not funny at all. but moves the story along. the third and best segment is by bobby rodriguez. ted is  paid by a wonderful antonio banderas to watch his kids while he and his wife go to a party. what ensues is the most hilarious part of the movie. at one point during the segment when ted leaps in an elevator and leaps up and makes the most awkward face. at this time i was crying. i usually dont like bobbys movies due to his extremely stupid ideas, i.e. guitar cases/bazookas, or crotch rockets, but this is truly a masterpiece from rodriguez. and finally comes tarantinos part in the whole saga of ted. ted almost quits until he is convinced by his boss to stay and fulfill the needs of the the character played by tarantino. im pretty sure tarantino rips off a hitchcock short. nothing new since tarantino has pretty much stolen everything hes ever made, but hes still my favorite director ever. his dialog is his strongest quality. i liked this movie. after the first vieing you might say, \\"what the _____.\\" but it is funny. g-unit.
B000001IPL|3.0|I am not the offspring fan i once was but this was one of my first punk albums and i still hold on to it for old times sake. this band became almost pathetic after showing so much promise with this album , ignition , and ixnay  which is a good follow up album. This album has  3 or 4 of their hits which can become tiresome since the radio pretty much killed them but it still has some hidden gems such as \\"nitro\\", smash, and whathappened to you, which has the offspring playing some ska.
B00006SFBD|5.0|This is a wicked \\"progressive metal\\" album...I'm relatively new to Opeth, having dismissed them early on, and only recently being wowed by \\"Damnation\\".  That album convinced me to start working backwards through their catalogue.  <BR>On this album, \\"Deliverance\\", the melodies and harmonies this band throws together cannot be denied.  Most of the compositions are fairly long, and well thought out, with chugging, brutal passages blending in with softer, more melodic interludes that really create and relieve tensions.  In this regard Opeth almost reminds me of a classic blues band, using slight variations of the same formula over and over again to \\"deliver\\" these musical tensions to the listener.  But don't be fooled, just like a good blues artist, this formula doesn't get tired, boring, and repetitive, because it used EFFECTIVELY!!!<BR>Don't underestimate Opeth.  Long ago I became sick of the cheese-ball death-metal vocals that sound like the Cookie Monster on a bad day, just for the sake of being cool, tough, and \\"hardcore\\". <BR>Well the Cookie Monster is Opeth's lead singer throughout much of this album, but despite this massive flaw, this album is a real, legitimate 5 STARS!!!  IT'S THAT GOOD!!!  <br />What's scary is I'm told the album before this was even better.  If it's even close, that means Opeth has 3 incredible albums under their belt.  This isn't Cradle of Filth, or your typical pubescent-teenager's Swedish \\"hardcore deathmetal\\" suck band...this a true heavy metal, with vision and talent that approaches Dream Theater's mastery, combined with Pantera's power and rage...CHECK IT OUT!!!
B00005JMX6|5.0|This is one of my favorite romantic comedies of all time!  It's cute, it's touching, and it's funny.  But this isn't just your typical comedy.  There are dramatic elements that separates this comedy from countless others.  Don't expect a raunchy, steaming softcore 'porn' movie.  Although the movie delves into the world of porn movies and porn stars, it is not the sole focus but rather a medium to which to tell the story.  Essentially, the Girl Next Door is a simple classic love story with lot of heart.  It's about how far one would go in the name of love.  <br /> <br />It's also one of the most touching and heartful comedies i've seen in a while.  The film has a greater emotional impact if you can relate to Matthew.  Matthew has met this new girl (his new next door neighbour) who brings meaning into his life.  She can bring a smile to his face and make him do things that he never would have done.  He loves her.  And he will do anything in order to be with her.  If you can relate to that, then I think you'll feel this movie.  Elisha Cuthbert is PERFECT in this movie.  She portrays the icy cool but down-to-earth sweetness attribute very well.  If you want to see more of Elisha, you should buy the 24 TV series Season 1 and 2.  That's the series where I first noticed this beautiful actress. <br /> <br />If you want to get the movie, buy the unrated version.  The differences between the unrated and rated is that the unrated version shows more frontal nudity.  An example is the lap dance scene in the strip bar: in the rated version those strippers wear a bra but in the unrated version they don't.  The unrated version also has extra featurettes and commentaries.
0553582453|2.0|Guaranteed that the Tawny Man series is much better than the Farseer Trilogy, still there are too many flaws for me to simply ignore and enjoy the story. <br /> <br />1) How can a nation comprised of six dutchies have a ruler, but no administration under the ruler? There are no ministers, no councils, no army command line, nothing. There's just a useless old man called Chade, who has assumed the title of Councilor in this series, and  who spends more time training assasins and spies than governing the realm of the Six Dutchies. And every character in the book then complaints that he / she has no time for anything else and is torn between family and duty! Can a story get more absurd and ridiculous than this?  <br /> <br />2) Even though Fitz is thirty five years of age, he is still treated by a boy of 15 by everyone around him, including himself. Every other paragraph, you can see these words \\"I observed the room as Chade taught me (25 years back)\\". I mean, who the hell remembers what someone taught 25 years back, and makes a pointed reference to it everytime? These little things make it seem as if Fitz never really grew up. And the continued practice of Chade calling Fitz \\"boy\\" adds weightage to that feeling. <br /> <br />3) The author forces too many emotions into the characters. For example, everytime Fitz sees the queen, he would feel \\"proud\\" and have \\"tears in his eyes\\", or \\"feel grateful\\" or \\"become overwhelmed with sympathy\\". Which is strange, because no one else seems to reciprocate his intensity of feelings, and he never recognizes this. Despite all that he has gone through and he has shared with the others, he refuses to give himself the rightful respect that he deserves. And which is why everyone else treats him the same way too. The same conflicting emotions - duty vs family, or peace and solitude vs intrigue and excitement - continue to be a major part of Fitz's character. One would imagine that a man of 35, who has gone through hell and been back, wouldhave mastered these once and far all and resolved himself to his fate.  <br /> <br />4) The most important of Fitz's companions - Nighteyes - has been awarded very little importance in book 2 and book 3. There's hardly any mention of the wolf, and it's as he never existed! I can't believe that Fitz, who continous to mourn for Verity and Molly and all those people who never really shared his soul, would hardly even mourn for Nighteyes!  <br /> <br />5) Just like the hero of Terry Goodkind's fantasy series, Fitz never gets around to mastering his magic even in Book 5! I know that this is a strategic decision by the author and central to the story plot, but it really becomes irritating to be constantly reminded of Galen's mistreatment of Fitz and how Fitz suffered during his treatment. We all know that Fitz cannot skill as well as others. So just get on with it, for God's sake! So why does Fitz need to get it reviewed every time with Chade in his chambers? And keep comparing himself to Dutiful? Will there be no end to this torture? <br /> <br />I can continue with the list of flaws, but I think readers would have got the idea by now. This was have been a good story with lots of potential, but the author has killed it with her immature writing and complete lack of character development. What a pity!
B0002F7I9Y|4.0|Ray Charles \\"Genius Loves Company\\" SA-CD First Impression<br /><br /> I love Ray Charles' work. So when this, his final release of new material, became available on SA-CD, I jumped at it.<br /><br /> I put in on Saturday night and mostly cried all the way through it. See, at least on record, Ray and I go back 45 years, since I first \\"discovered\\" his genius in the collection of an older brother of a friend (that was the day I first heard Buddy Holly, too).<br /><br /> I won't list the titles that forever altered American popular music; if you know the body of work, such a listing is not needed. If you don't know his late 50s to mid 60s stuff, your education is sorely lacking. Get to it.<br /><br /> Ray Charles changed my white-bread musical experience forever. His hot-weld of sacred and profane, the power of his instrument, and the force of his emotion became the gold standard for me. Don't cha know, baby.<br /><br /> Time and illness are sadly in evidence here. While the emotion is ever present, this is not a disc that showcases Ray's majestic talent. That magnificent voice, as unique and as full of authority as a pipe organ, is weakened, tired.<br /><br /> Like the last few Billie Holiday recordings, this is a portrait of the artist in decline. Indeed, \\"Sorry\\" does seem to be the hardest word, right next to \\"sad\\".<br /><br /> Interestingly, a live recording/duet of Van Morrison's \\"Crazy Love\\" was the spark that set this project in motion. It is the last track on this CD, but it is the only one that, in my opinion, comes close to revealing what Ray was all about. After that session, the studio work for this release was scheduled pretty quickly; there was no shortage of volunteers. But his decline must have been swift from there, burning out quickly like a shooting star, like a comet, like fireworks.<br /><br /> Man, I loved this guy's work.
0553582445|2.0|Guaranteed that the Tawny Man series is much better than the Farseer Trilogy, still there are too many flaws for me to simply ignore and enjoy the story. <br /> <br />1) How can a nation comprised of six dutchies have a ruler, but no administration under the ruler? There are no ministers, no councils, no army command line, nothing. There's just a useless old man called Chade, who has assumed the title of Councilor in this series, and  who spends more time training assasins and spies than governing the realm of the Six Dutchies. And every character in the book then complaints that he / she has no time for anything else and is torn between family and duty! Can a story get more absurd and ridiculous than this?  <br /> <br />2) Even though Fitz is thirty five years of age, he is still treated by a boy of 15 by everyone around him, including himself. Every other paragraph, you can see these words \\"I observed the room as Chade taught me (25 years back)\\".

B00006L7XQ|5.0|Johnny Cash found the answers to life and has graciously shared them with us via this wonderful album.  It is a very emotional look at life and what is most important -- love, God, and friends.  I feel as if he is sharing is most intimate thoughts directly with his wife, June Carter Cash, and he has allowed us to listen in.  This album may change your life, or at least your view of it, and how you live it.  After listening to this album, I realize that life is too short to worry about the little things that may stress us out daily.  We're here for such a short time, and I want to make the most of it.  This album is about looking back, reflecting, and hoping that it was a life well lived.<br /><br />Cash's voice adds to the deeply moving lyrics of the songs on this album.  The songs are well chosen, and he brings them to life with such feeling.  This is a very emotional, touching, moving, album.  I wish that Johnny were still alive so I could say \\"Thank You.\\"
B00005JNEI|1.0|Michael Moore conjures Mel Gibson's character in \\"Conspiracy Theory\\".  That people really take this (admittedly clever)hyper-slanted b.s. seriously just shows how hateful the left side of the aisle has become.
B00003CXCT|5.0|George Lucas is a God among mortals. How dare anyone bash his brilliant works of art? No matter what he does to his films they will still be the greatest movies of all time. I know people say this a lot but it's true: they are his movies and he can do what ever he wants with them.  <br /> <br />I'm so sorry for the fans that feel betrayed by Lucas because he made changes that please him (the only person that matters by the way). Why don't you all go gather up some money and make a movie that you wont complain about so you don't have to make the rest of the worlds ears bleed with your uninformed whining?  <br /> <br />Everyone who writes a review saying that he shouldn't have changed his original work is a hypocrite. How many of you can honestly say that you've never been a little disappointed with something you have done and wanted to change it? George Lucas just has the power to go back and change the things he feels he couldn't get across in the originals. All of the things he's changing are the things that he originally wanted in the films; he just didn't have the money or technology to put them in. <br /> <br />To all those people who still think Lucas is Satan for changing his vision on what he thinks Star Wars should be I have only pity for you. You can't even enjoy something that has changed the entire film world for its brilliance. To everyone else I hope you enjoy the Star Wars trilogy when it comes out on Sept. 21. It should prove to be the highlight of anyone's DVD collection! <br />
B000063DFN|4.0|Powerslave is one of Iron Maiden's finest recordings. It does not dissapoint on any level. You've got some hits, some lesser known tracks and of course, the epics. That sounds like a good Maiden album to me. There are some lesser moments, but nothing that really drags this one down. For me, the finest moments are the opening and closing tracks. Rime of the Ancient Mariner is the kind of long song that really does not feel like its draging on, while Aces High is a moderatly quick burst of awesome metal. You may want to check it out, for it it not a perfect record, but it is easy to get into. Powerslave is really a fantastic record. Check it out for yourself.
B00027JYLC|4.0|Monday, September 13, 2004 / 4 of 5 / Exploit or insight?<br /><br />A glamorous but evil hearted femme fatale targets the midget owner [?] of a small traveling circus and freak show.  Intent on poisoning him to gain the inheritance, she crosses paths with the rest of the freaks and pays the ultimate price.  This is the polarizing film, Freaks.  Rarely making appearances on TV this release on DVD is most welcomed.  Most of the ah, freaks indicated that it was not a great experience making this film, and indeed they had to deal with the same gawking and discrimination on the studio lot that they saw in their real lives.  The plot is a simplistic love triangle cum revenge story where the trapeze starlet conspires with the strong man to bilk the midget out of his fortune.  Despite their marriage, the rest of the freaks see through the façade and extract their justice.  There are chilling moments in the final reel, especially the furtive glances and looks of hatred employed by the freaks once they find out the intentions of the `big' couple.  Their chase of the antagonists in the mud and rain is classic, particularly effective in that it's often a slow crawl towards the camera, knives in hand.  I was a bit torn by the film at once it is an effective story, but also is it right to be so morbidly curious about the human conditions that these people found themselves born into.  If anything, perhaps the film forces a re-examination of our own viewpoints and humanity.
B0002PUH2Y|5.0|This cd is amazing!  the artist is from the south of Spain and this is heavily reflected in the music.  She is also a child of today and subsequently mixes many musical styles.  Most notably on the \\"SKA de la tierra\\" track there is some great reggae mix.  the overall message is far from \\"girl power\\" which you might think from her tiny voice.  she has some very powerful themes which include independence and escaping spousal abuse.  i totally recommend it.  this is one of the few new cds i own where i actually love almost every single track equally.
0894803123|5.0|I love ice cream.  I bet Ben & Jerry won't mind my saying I love Haagen Dazs' Rum Raisin and Breyer's Butter Pecan and there's hardly anything more decadent than one of those Chocolate Dove Bars.<br /><br />Ben & Jerry's is over the top, double-dog wicked good.  They obviously got the idea of picking out big chunks of great-tasting items and putting them into their ice cream.  Some of their flavors are so full of big chunks of chocolate, delicious nuts and flavorful fruits it seems like you can hardly find the ice cream for the goodies!<br /><br />Ben & Jerry's is also a Great-American success story of a \\"Mom and Pop\\" business that started out with a couple of guys who wanted to make good ice cream.<br /><br />This book is a bargain for Ice Cream lovers.  You get easy-to-use recipes for hundreds of ice creams and other desserts - with favorites like \\"Cherry Garcia\\" and \\"Heath Bar Crunch\\".  You also get a mini-history of Ben & Jerry's Ice Cream company with interesting tidbits like their fight to allow their Ice Cream to be sold in groceries against one of the food superpowers, who was trying to push Ben & Jerry aside.  If B&J hadn't won that legal battle it's unlikely you or I would have ever heard of them and their wonderful ice creams, but it's still fun to read the first-person of this little New England David slaying the corporate Goliath.  Ben & Jerry are well-known for their support of environmental-friendly causes, and they also struck a wonderful blow for free enterprise!  Anyway - read more about that in the book.<br /><br />The book includes fantastic recipes, but also juicy tidbits - things you can do to your ice-cream or ingredients to make them \\"creamier\\" or have more \\"mouthfeel\\".  For you cooks who love to experiment in the kitchen, this book gives you a great starting place - they give you several excellent \\"starter\\" base recipes.  Then, once you've got your basic vanilla or chocolate (and they give you variations on each, along with their two cents about what makes one different from another) you can go crazy and add your own goodies.<br /><br />Almost all of the recipes are to make a quart or quart and a half - exactly the right amount to go in one of those great new electric ice-cream makers.  There are several of THOSE you can get for less than $30.<br /><br />Only recommended for those who love ice cream.  Is that you?

B00005JKJA|5.0|I'm not going to write about the plot of this movie because that would be pointless.  To start of, there is no real plot to the story, there isn't an order, but it does not by any circumstance lack cohesion.  If you have already seen this movie, read on you might mind an answer.  If you haven't don't, unless you become too baffled by it and you need a clue.   <br />To explain this i'll have to use the actresses's names instead of the characters since I can't possible find another way to do it. <br />Bear with me: <br /> <br />1.  There is no order in space or time.  The whole movie (except for a few moments at the end when Naomi Watt's character hires an assasin, which is the key to understanding this) happens entirely in her head.  What triggers everything is the the Laura Harring character leaving Naomi's for the cowboy director. Naomi's personality becomes fragmented, hence, the first part of the movie, including the credits, are part of a dream, of an idealized reality.  This is the reason why at the first hour and a half or so of the movie there is a sense that everything being fake: from the way people act, to certain situation's that seem to have no connection with main \\"plot\\".  That was something that i found really breakthrough, these amazing actresses willingly act like they're on days of our lives just to give you a clue.  The horrible acting at the beguinning is COMPLETLY INTENTIONAL.  <br /> <br />2. There are two deaths in the movie. One is Naomi's suicide (because her lover left her, and since she wouldn't come back she decides to kill her) and two, laura's death which we never get to see. <br /> <br />3. The blue box is the cathalicyst.   She's supposed to get the blue key after Laura is dead, which she sees on her table in the second bizarro part of the movie which is the only thing real.  In the dream world (1st part) Laura open it: the reason for this is that Naomi feels that Laura brought this upon herself. <br /> <br />4. The \\"Silencio\\" Theaterpart is the biggest clue, and it mean (to me anyway) that sadness (note the lighting) and confusion are really self induced.  Hence the \\"No hay banda\\".  There is no band.  It doesn't mean that nothing is real, it mean that everything is fake, it doesn't exist (think about it). <br />The purpose of this scene is not to confuse you, but to warn you. <br /> <br />5. Naomi is replaying and rearranging the whole thing.  Whether they really did have an affair or not is kind of a mystery.  She was obsessed, that much I can say, but I'm not sure if it was real. <br /> <br />6. She probably kills herself, not just out of repent (note the old people, representing good christian values, tormenting her) but out of misery: She realices after she wakes up that that particular relationship wouldn't have worked, ever.  didn't work in a dream of hers, it wasn't going to work in real life, but by that time it's already late, she has already killed her. <br /> <br />7. The Director, lossing his grip.  The only reason she dreams of him the way she does is because she wishes he had no power, she feels that's the main reason Laura preffers him over her, who in turn, has absolutely no power.  She has lost all control. <br /> <br />With this explained I hope you can figure out the rest because it would be just to long to explain.  The main thing is this:  Think of the movie backwards.  It's not about what happens, it's about how she feels and about how she thinks Laura's character feel, and about how she wishes things would have turned out.  The grimmest parts are the real ones. <br /> <br />I really congratulate David Lynch for having loosened and tied the stings in new and amazing ways, this is what he is a master at.  It's not that hard to understand, it's just that audiences have no interest in understanding it. <br />Give the movie another chance and once you get you'll really thank Mr. Lynch for making you dust off your brain. <br />Remember that something you may not be able to explain since this was originally a pilot for a tv series (just like lost highway) that also, never got made, so some pieces might be missing, or maybe I still just haven't found them.
0784011680|5.0|Love him or leave him, this is Robert Downey, Jr.'s finest performance. He should have won an Oscar for his heartfelt portrayal of the late, great Charlie Chaplin.  I'd never truly known Mr. Chaplin's work or his zest for it until seeing this movie.  It is timeless must-own. Great cast. Rich script.  Grab some popcorn (of the old-fashioned variety), sit back and sink in.
B00008WJBU|5.0|What a film.  I have to be honest, I'd never heard of this before, but I am so glad I took a chance with it. <br />Its quite a difficult film plot to describe: but in a nut shell its about a dangerous game played with people who have proved to be 'extremely' lucky (perhaps supernaturally so).  The games become more and more dangerous, and are always played blindfolded (my favourite was running through a forest hand ties behind backs - the last NOT to run into a tree is the winner).  There is a reason for this (which I wont disclose) and this is genuinely and exciting a quite unique movie. <br />All the actors are excellent (especially Max von Sydow and the gorgeous Leonardo Sbaraglia from Burnt Money). <br />A thrilling and inventive movie. <br />(NB: The film is mainly in Spanish with some English)
B000002IOW|4.0|This was essentially my debut album as a fan of Rush.  It was 1989 and I was a senior in High School.  I had heard the AOR stations play Rush for many years but wasn't any sort of devoted fan.  The album struck a chord with me... even though \\"Presto\\" and \\"Show Don't Tell\\" aren't their best tracks, and even nice poppy tunes like \\"Superconductor\\" and \\"The Pass\\" are a little fluffy compared to their previous work.  The album caused me to delve deeper into their catalog and for that I am eternally grateful.  I'm not one to believe in magic...
B00005JMJ4|1.0|Unimpressive: Nothing happens. No conflicts, no characters, <br />no idea. The Ultimate Boredom Movie. <br />Best to put me asleep on Sunday afternnoon. <br />Did not make me think after. <br /> <br />One look on the bored face and the nigtgown of the actor <br />is enough to tell you enough. <br />Waste of time.
B00008A7QK|5.0|Electric Warrior is one of the best rock albums ever.  Every track is pure genius and this albums rocks.  Marc Bolan was unfairly neglected in the U.S., probably because he was worshipped by teenage girls in the UK--doubly unfair since so were the Beatles!!  His body of work (also check out the UK box set, Marc Bolan 20th Century Superstar) stands the test of time, was totally prescient, and definitely rivals his main competitor David Bowie. Had he lived past 29 years, his commercial fortunes, which peaked with Bang a Gong on this album, would have no doubt rebounded.  Marc Bolan belongs in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and shame on the powers that be for never nominating him.
B0002EXH4K|5.0|This is one of the best Metal Albums ever released by any band on the planet. It is powerful, intelligent, and features some of the best musical talent ever recorded! You will not find many albums by any other artist that can measure up to this one. If you don't already own \\"Countdown to Extinction\\" your music CD collection simply is not complete!
1417630183|5.0|This is a wonderful and highly original novel about a mentally challenged man named Charlie who wanted to be smart. One day, his wish was granted. A group of scientists selected him for an experimental operation which would to raise his intelligence to genius level. Suddenly, Charlie found himself transformed, and life, as he knew it, changed.<br /><br />His story is told entirely through Charlie's eyes and perceptions in the form of progress reports. The reader actually sees the change in Charlie take place, as his progress reports become more complex, well written, and filled with the angst of personal discovery and growth, as well as with his gradual awareness of his amazing and accelerated intellectual development.<br /><br />The progress reports are a wonderful contrivance for facilitating the story, and the reader is one with Charlie on his voyage of self-discovery. What happens to Charlie in the long run is profoundly moving and thought provoking. It is no wonder that this author was the recipient of the Nebula Award, which is given by the Science Fiction Writers of America for having written the Best Novel of the Year. This is definitely a book well worth reading and having in one's personal collection. Bravo!
B0001L3LUE|3.0|It's not every day that you get a documentary shoot on one of the top players. <br />That is the good thing on this movie; it's straight from the \\"horses mouth\\" <br />But the downside is that failed to engage me. <br />I found it a bit boring.  <br />Personally I would have preferred if the interviewer had been more active and engaged in conversion instead of making it a McNamara monologue. <br />
B000002GFT|5.0|I first came across this album a little over 20 years ago in a water damaged box in a cottage in the Scottish borders. Since then it has been one of my favourite albums ever. It still sounds fresh today and has the best Fairport lineup and the most infectious energy and emotion of any of their work. I love most of Fairport's early output but this is singularly better than even What we did... or Unhalfbricking. Add \\"No Roses\\" by Shirley Collins and the Albion Country Band and you have the two most essential folk rock albums with the most awesome lineup of British folk musicians ever gathered. Listen to these two records and hear a thousand bands that have followed in their footsteps, and a few centuries of storytelling in song come to life. Revel in the romance and tragedy of Matty Groves, ache with the doomed Crazy Man Michael, jig and reel with the Medley, be astonished that Farewell Farewell wasn't written a couple of hundred years ago - if you like music, you need this album!
B00009MGR6|4.0|Yes, it's true: AC/DC has been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame! For years, the coterie of insouciant folksters (too lame to call rockers) like Bonnie Raitt, Jackson Browne and Bruce Springsteen are finally fading from the forefront as the Great Wall of Indifference erected against hard rock and metal begins to crumble brick by brick. A couple years ago, the first leak appeared in the dam, when Aerosmith was inducted, but now a full-fledged heavy metal band of hard drinking blue collar boys has bust it open. Bon, whereever you are, I hoist a brew for you! <br /> <br />So, in the car the morning after their induction, I picked this under-rated gem to listen to to get my AC/DC fix, and I was not left wanting. The first time I heard this record, I  thought \\"huh?\\" But after repeated listenings, it grows on ya. This was accomplished on a cross country drive across Canada: I bought the cassette in Kingston, Ontario, but by the time I left British Columbia and drove into Washington, we were like old friends. <br /> <br />One of the things that threw me for a loop was Brian Johnson's vocals; It sounded as though he were singing in an echo chamber, the miking was so far away. Good vocals, nonetheless, but too distant to grab you by the throat. <br /> <br />Angus and Malcolm's twin guitar attack is honed sharp as, well, a razor's edge, and I especially love the quintessential AC/DC pentatonic blues scale when employed on this album. Cliff's bass is thumping, and even though I'm a Phil Rudd fan, I like Simon Wright's drumming -- clean, somewhat jazzy, but it is a bit out of place on an AC/DC album; he's too free and loose with the notes, particularly on the ride and high hat cymbals. Phil, on the other hand, is a human metronome, but he's got a sweet sound, particularly when in sync with the bass guitar. <br /> <br />Here's some of the killer tunes on the album: <br /> <br />Kissin' Dynamite: Just a great power trip. <br /> <br />Some Sin For Nothin': Excellent solos, ensemble playing and cool double entendre of the \\"blatant subtlety\\" variant that sets AC/DC apart from D.H. Lawrence or Walt Whitman. <br /> <br />Ruff Stuff and Two's Up: Really dirty blues backbeat (both) and driving go-go beat (latter).  <br /> <br />Meanwhile, it may surprise listeners that I think \\"Heatseeker\\" is one of the weaker songs in this mix. The rest are just reliable meatgrinders, and once you get a third or fourth hearing, you'll be hooked.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Fox...The name strikes up the ire of thousands of people around the country and the world.  And this series is why.  This is a beautiful series that was loved dearly by her cast and crew, and her ravenous fans.  A show with the touches that only Joss Whedon can bring, but so much more than his previous works.  The music, the cast, the direction and writing, the amazing effects, all come together to make one of the best television shows ever created, and cut short by the Reality TV Action Sex addicted Fox executives.
B00003CXAT|5.0|There aren't enough good things said about Jurassic Park. Like most Michael Chrichton books, Jurassic Park was made for the movies. The casting is excellent in every role. This is the first time we see CGI almost throughout an entire movie. John Williams' score adds to the grandeur of seeing dinosaurs in the wild. Jurassic Park is simply stated as the best movie of the 1990's.

B00006FIAZ|5.0|I stopped listening to black and death metal many years ago for various reasons. But there are two albums that I always keep returning to, one of them is Entombed's \\"Wolverine Blues\\" and the other one is Dissection \\"Somberlain\\". <br />This is a unique album, and a true masterpiece. I've listened to hundreds of black metal bands but none of them could ever compare with Dissection, and this album is thier best work. It's dark, powerful, melodic and simply beautiful. It's well written, well performed and well produced. Even people who aren't into metal would actually be able to enjoy this album. <br />Giving it less than five stars would be unfair.
6305907145|1.0|After much anticipation I bought the dvd only to be extremely disappointed by the direction and total lack of continuity.  Unlike the book, the movie jumped from one scene to another without going into any real depth of human thoughts and emotions as expressed by Austin.  Fair enough the book is not as dynamic as Pride and Prejudice but in its own righs it is a good story with many subjects as subtext. Unfortunately the movie makers failed to focus on any of those. It also seemed like they changed the story line and decided to take some parts out altogether. There was no mention of Fanny's much loved brother to whom she writes while at Manafield Park.  Mrs Norris being one of the book's main characters was hardly part of the movie (an injustice to one of Austin's well written if not most liked characters). Fanny in the book is a church mouse with unexpressed opinions whereas in the movie she is shown to be  expressing herself without any hesitations and Edmund's influential skills have been missed out taking the life and soul out of his character.  Crawfords seem to appear out of thin air in the movie without any mention of the Grants.  It looks like that the director was in a real rush to get the jist of the movie across.  Some of the crucial scenes of attachment between Edmund and Mary have been avoided and it seems like they formed an attachment overnight for each other and seem can be said about Henry's affections towards Fanny. <br /> <br />All in all Austin fans would be disappointed by this highly \\"fast pace\\" version of Mansfield Park.
B0000CFW87|5.0|This guy and I are the same age and I cannot believe that wonderful voice comes out of him. This CD is a must get and I am glad I bought it.  It is a perfect way to relax after a long day- his voice just soothes you. Favorite tunes are of course Oceano- also Mi Mancherai, Per Te, and Remember when it rained. He packs so much power into his music and Thank God for whoever discovered him!
B00005JMAH|3.0|I love the book and the first two movies.  This movie, as has been said, varies way too much from the main plot of the book.  The art directing and cinematography are fantastic.  I think it is a better and more real world version of the magic world, even if it is different from Chris Columbus.  The plot of the story in the movie is beyond weak. Dialog is pathetic. Way too many of the important parts of the story line have been left out.  The flow of the movie does not make sense.  The movie should not only stand on its own, but should also relate to the personal growth of Harry and the gang. It doesn't, and that is why it is not a good \\"Harry Potter\\" movie. Take out Harry Potter and it is a better movie.
B00005JMJG|5.0|Since everyone has already mentioned the plot of this film in their reviews, I'll just stick to what I liked about the direction and the acting.  First off, the movie really makes you feel like you're in someone's mind.  Many of the things we experience in our own dreams are in this movie.  Such as talking to someone and not being able to make out their face.  As well as being in one place and then instantly being somewhere else.  The acting was well done also.  Jim Carey didn't play the character of Joel in an over-the-top manner.  He played the character straight and with a less-is-more approach.  Kate Winslet was good as well, she was believable as a woman that you could see someone liking as a girlfriend, and also as a girlfriend that has certain personality flaws about herself that could be annoying in a relationship.  All of this with the great writing of course is what helps this movie be the creative work of art that it is.
B00005MP58|5.0|An excellent (by the book apart from wet Mr Darcy, although no complaints) adaptation by BBC. I thoroughly enjoyed it as the characters and the story line was followed very acurately.  The chemistry between Elizabeth and Mr Darcy is thrilling although it would have been nicer to give voice to some of Eliza's thoughts during the process of \\"change of heart\\" towards Darcy.   <br /> <br />All I want to say is that all the characters were played with utmost accuracy with real presence.  This is a must see and more importantly must own for all Austin fans. A real treat!
1594200106|5.0|Shadow of the Wind is one of the most enjoyable reads I've had in some time.  Part of the reason for that, I think, is that Zafon's own love for reading comes out so clearly in the book. And reading of all sorts; he is no literary snob. Shadow is a wonderfully spiced stew of genres.  Magical realism? The main character visits the Cemetery of Forgotten Books.  Historical fiction?  It's set in mid-century Spain against the backdrop of the civil war.  Mystery?  The main plot is an attempt to track down the mysterious author of several novels as well as the mysterious figure who has seemingly made it his life work to collect and burn them all.  Gothic?  We have haunted houses, basement crypts, strange noises, etc.  Bibliophilia?  All is set in motion by the reading of a novel, much centers on finding the author, many characters are themselves booksellers or collectors.  Victorian?  Got it.  Revenge, noire, romance, coming-of-age?  Got it, got it, got it, got it.  Metafiction? Got it. Melodrama?  Oh my, do we have melodrama.  Admittedly, some may find all of the above (and that is by no means an exhaustive list of the genres Zafon employs) simply a dull collection of cliches.  Personally, to me that's like saying a rainbow is just a collection of the colors on the cans in my pantry.  Zafon employs, plays with, at times transcends the genre cliches to form his own original, compelling, enjoyable work.<br /><br />  As mentioned, the basic storyline is the attempt over the span of years by the main character Daniel to find out what happened to the author of a novel entitled Shadow of the Wind.  The author has disappeared and is rumored dead. His poor-selling novels have disappeared over the years, bought and burned by a mysterious figure who may or may not be the same person as another mysterious figure (did I mention we have melodrama) who uses the name of one of the author's fictional characters.<br /><br />  Structurally, the story unfolds as many stories within stories, as a large number of characters get to relate their own related tales through speech, letter, manuscript, third-hand conversations, and so on.  There are therefore many flashbacks but they are integrated smoothly into the story, if not particularly subtly, and present no problem of confusion.  They also serve to add to the compelling nature of the story by interrupting the straightforward narrative and by offering teasing hints of upcoming resolutions.  Without going into spoiler detail, there is also a nice structural parallel between modern day events/characters and past events/characters.<br /><br />  Stylistically, the language is mostly a sheer joy (nod to the translator here), though it veers a bit over the top at times.  Zafon displays a strong stylistic range, creating frightening physical settings in the gothic mode with the same ease as he does slapstick action or dialogue.  There are some lines that you just want to linger over for their beauty of description or their concise wit.<br /><br />  The plot is compelling throughout and complex enough to keep the reader guessing.  The characters are fun, though since Zafon is playing with character type here, some are a bit two-dimensional.  This is no complaint,  however, since the way they play out their genre-type roles is much of the fun of the novel.  If Daniel himself isn't the most compelling of characters, he is sympathetically and fully drawn and  his lack of \\"verve\\" is more than made up for by his sidekick Fermin, himself a figure with a \\"mysterious past\\" and one who I thought could have come straight out of Dumas.<br /><br />  Is Shadow a \\"great\\" book?  I can't quite go there.  There were times when, despite all the joy, I felt it was missing a little something, felt it needed a bit more depth. And I still haven't decided if the last story-within-a-story was justified; part of me leans toward thinking it marred the ending by wrapping it up a bit too neatly and prosaically.  so a great book? Perhapsnot. A great read?  Absolutely.  The difference between the two?  A matter of personal opinion I'm guessing so I'll leave that to the individual reader, of which there should be many.  A strong, strong recommendation.solutely.  The difference between the two?  A matter of personal opinion I'm guessing so I'll leave that to the individual reader, of which there should be many.

B000002IPZ|3.0|Souls of Black is not Testament's finest album.  That much is true.  However, it isn't a bad record.  The truth behind this recording is that the band was rushed into recording it, so it would be released at the same time as a European \\"Clash of the Titans\\" tour, featuring Megadeth and Slayer.  The band has never liked it.  But, there are some good songs here.  (Good old vinyl years) Side one is strong.  So, the first six tunes are pretty good.  And side two starts with Malpractice which is okay as well.  The Legacy is also a very good song.  So, there's enough here to give it at least 3 stars.   Where Souls of Black falters is on the production end.  The sound is too thin, and not loud enough. The drums are buried way back in the mix too often.  The bass is also lost in some songs.  It's hard to headbang to this album, because it's just not HARD, even if the songs are heavy.  But, it does provide some decent listening for metal fans.  It was definately, at the time, fairly progressive thrash metal.  Not the worst album you could have in your collection.
B000028U0Y|5.0|What can be said about this album?  It's one of the greatest live album of all time, one of the great country albums of all time, and one of Johnny Cash's \\"must have\\" albums.  Johnny performs before a \\"captive\\" audience, and holds them in the palm of his hand.  Some of these inmates may not have been country music fans, but they were definitely Johnny Cash fans.  There was just something about him that the prisoners could relate to.  It probably helped that a lot of the songs here are about prisoners.  Not that this is a somber concert, by any means.  It's actually a joyous event, with Johnny cracking jokes and singing several humerous songs.  The CD adds three bonus tracks that were cut from the original album, due to time constraints.  The curse words are also uncensored this time around.  Highly recommended.
B0001CCXZW|5.0|I love this show, it's rib crackingly hilarious and yet can knock you over like a dramatic sledgehammer or even bring you to tears, and without drizzling you with fake sentimentality. Has some of the best acting on TV. It's robbed every year at the Emmys.  So clever and smart and perfect. Great show.
B00003CXBK|5.0|Princess Mononoke has won kudos and fame for its complex story and gorgeous animation. Created by Hayao Miyazaki, this is not a tale for the young kids. <br /> <br />We begin with Ashitaka, a boy in feudal Japan who kills a boar that is infected with demonic anger. He heads out to find the source of this infection. As he goes on his quest, he gets embroiled in a struggle between the wild survival of nature and the deliberate progress of technology.  <br /> <br />The title Mononoke is a human girl who was raised by wolves. She fights alongside them to defend her homeland. The people of \\"Irontown\\" are of course taking over the forest to fuel their industry. But nothing is ever black and white in this movie. Nature lives on a creed of kill-or-be-killed. The humans simply want to survive as well, and that means they consume resources.  <br /> <br />There's a rich blend of Japanese mythology in the story as well, helping you understand the underlying beliefs that many in Asia hold dear. It's like talking about fairies and wishes in a European story, about wishing on a star or crossing fingers for good luck. <br /> <br />This is NOT a movie for the young. I know a 9 yr old who saw this and was upset for weeks afterwards. It involves a lot of violence and adult themes. There are no easy answers here. But for teens and above, it does give you a lot to think about.
B0002Z0EYA|5.0|I think this is an excellent movie. Brad Pitt is at his most beautiful in this movie. I wasnt really that familar with Eric Bana but after I saw this movie, I think he is just as great as Brad. Orlando Bloom is not my favorite actor and his role in this movie is proof of that. He is terrible and whinny through out the whole movie. I think I would have pick a better actor with more of a stage presence. Orlando is kinda whimpy and scrawny to me. But I loved this movie despite Orlando. Everyone did a wonderful job. Peter O'Toole is great and Brian Cox. I can't wait till the DVD because I want to see all the special features. I absolutely recomend buying this DVD. Its worth it. Great historical epic movie.
B00003CXCT|1.0|I had just about convinced myself that I could live with the \\"Special Edition\\" if that was my only choice...however, when I read about the additional changes made in the 2004 version, I cancelled my order...I do not understand 1.) why they have to change the dialog in a movie that many people have practically memorized, and 2.) why it is necessary to put Hayden Christensen's \\"ghost\\" in the final scene replacing Sebastian Shaw...(I have not been very impressed with Episodes I and II anyway.) Maybe an \\"artist\\" does have the right to change his own work, but I think it's a shame that so many fans are being robbed of these beloved classics. After all, it was the fans who made the original movies so successful, and we liked them just the way they were... :-(
B000060P79|1.0|Maxi pads that is! I saw a poster of these posers, and they tried to rip off the Casualties. In this Casualties poster I have, the band is standing all pissed off in a junk yard, in the Simple Rip-Off, they stood tryin to look cool in an abandoned lot(i bet they had security to protect their rich boy asses!) I hate posers, and i am tired of rippin off the Casualties and other true punk bands. 0 stars please!!!
B00004XPP0|3.0|I remember when the Star Wars Espido I was premiere. I went to the theather to see the the \\"modified\\" Trilogy.  <br />I see some strange fixs in the movie, I just can say my memory was also be modified at that moment and make me confused.  <br />However, I could not understnad why Lucas did it? Perhaps that's his unfinished job only.  <br />For me, the Trilogy is a wonderful memory, who care the contents need to be fix or not, use new CG technology to make up also unnecessary.  <br />The original Trilogy maybe not perfect, but it's a true memory. <br />
B000000WFZ|5.0|Ennio Morricone achieves with The Mission what few composers ever achieve... a work of art as important and powerul as the film which it represents.  The music and the film become inescapably entwined through the message and power of Roland Joff's direction and this brilliant soundtrack.  Some of my favorite trakcs include the main theme which shows up in \\"Falls\\", \\"The Mission\\", \\"River\\", and \\"Miserere.\\"  \\"Gabriel's Oboe\\" is presented twice on the soundtrack.  Words often fail to describe the magnitude of emotion that can be elicited by these compositions.  However I would agree with one other reviewer the the darker themes alternately detract from the soundtrack, but only slightly.  This will remain one of the most solid and stunning original scores ever created for a long long time.
B00005JMUA|1.0|Nas never stole 2pacs music on illmatic.Nas was bigger at the time.2Pac and Nas are the my all time Favorites.One man that is not a 2Pac biter is Nas.Infact they did not even like each other that much.But anyway this movie sucks too so you got 2 things.This is no beef it is just telling the facts
B00008YLV2|4.0|Black Hawk Down is not an entertaining film, unlike Bruckheimer's previous effort Pearl Harbor or The Rock, nor is it fully an epic like Ridley Scott's Gladiator.  It is in it's own class.  This docudrama was highly underrated.  Though released after 9-11-01 and no doubt prodded by patriotism, this film got too few Oscars.  The story is sad as it shows troops, much like the men and women in Iraq, being led into a war and not always knowing why, just doing their duty.  There are faceless references to other generals, The UN, and even Aidid the warlord.  This was all on purpose, focusing on the young troopers not the overview that Pearl Harbor and Gladiator attempted.  The battles are intense, loud, and gory.  Much like real war.  Many complain about the lack of focus on the Somalis, but this film, like Mark Bowden's book focused primarily on our troops, their mission, and the sometimes horrible deaths they faced.  Good performances are done by Eric Bana (the Hulk), William Fichtner (every Jerry Bruckheimer movie known to man), Josh Hartnett (Pearl Harbor), Sam Shepherd (Swordfish), and the dozens of young starts portraying our troops.  This film is great film.  Not for entertainment but for stirring some thoughts on war and where it may head.
B000003TAR|5.0|This is a review of this album, and no other piece by anyone. <br /> <br />This is an awesome album! The Lyrics are fantastic! The music is just as good. <br /> <br />\\"i wish i could eat your cancer when you turn black\\" <br /> <br />\\"my heart is broke, but i have some glue, help me inhale and mend it with you\\" <br /> <br />\\"i tried to hard to have a father but instead i have a dad\\" <br /> <br />and much much more! <br /> <br />you don't know what these mean? then i suggest you lay off on whatever your on or take more of it whether its sleep or _______. <br /> <br />Kurt's lyrics are awesome. and Nirvana's music is like a lot of good rock music in a sense where it is not always heavy. I mean sure heavy is awesome but its nice to hear a nice piece that takes a little break to see what else they are capable of. <br /> <br />This is a must own if you want some variety in your collection. <br />and a lot of people say this <br /> <br />\\"but his vocals, they suck\\" <br /> <br />no, MY vocals suck! <br />Justin Timberlake's vocals SUCK. <br />my brother andrew's vocals cucks! <br /> <br />Kurt can sign! he does his scream for certain parts of song and its brilliant. sometimes when he does a sweet vocal you can hear his voice go a bit stressed. (not the AC\DC type of stressed) <br /> <br />but like all singers should be doing is learn as they sing and that's what Kurt did. he was showing his effort in this album. and effort is what important. <br />and their drummer is great here too! <br /> <br />so buy it, and you will like it if you like original nice grunge (rock!) <br />see ya, another review from me, later.
B00004SCX6|5.0|Here is a quick review of each song on Britney Spears' sophmore album, \\"Oops!...I Did It Again.\\"  <br /> <br />Oops: Amazing song, some kind of remembrance to her first hit single, \\"Baby One More Time.\\" <br /> <br />Stronger: I LOVE this song, its by far one of the best songs, the lyrics are amazing and the beat is just so up and positive. For anyone who has ever been through any kind of conflict, it's such a defining song. <br /> <br />Dont go knockin on my door: Eh, well of all of them it's not my favorite, but it's still a cool song with a great beat. But I gotta love it anyways 'cause it's Britney. <br /> <br />Satisfaction: Not a very good remake of the Rolling Stones classic. I don't really like the beginning of the song either (the tempo and beat). <br /> <br />Dont let me be the last to know: This is going to be her second single off the new album. It's written by Shania Twain and her husband, Mutt Lange. The words to this song are outstanding. A great slow song. It really eases your mind. <br /> <br />What U see is (what U get): The opening bars are just so cool; it gets u into the song right away. Another strong defining song. The beat throughout the song is awesome. <br /> <br />Lucky: I love it, it's a great tune, melody and beat. I love how her voice sounds in this one, I can't really explain it. You'll have to hear this one yourself. Her voice is kinda funky. <br /> <br />One Kiss From you: It sorta sounds like something from the last album, but you can tell it's not because of the maturity in her voice. I like it, it definitely has potenial to be one of my faves. <br /> <br />Where are you now: After a few days of listening to it, I love it, it's one of the few ballads that she has done, and she really shows off her voice in it, and of course we know the power she has in her voice. <br /> <br />Cant make you love me: i would LOVE for this song to be the next single is. it's fun, and yet moving at the same time. The beat and words just make it one of the best! <br /> <br />When your eyes say it: it kinda reminds me of that all saints song, \\"Never Ever In The Start\\", but then it goes into a different style completely. she has that breathy airy touch to her voice in this song. and she actually pulls off the talking in this song. <br /> <br />Dear Diary: An ok song, a good choice though in her track placement. It's of course, the last track. It kinda has the finishing touch and tempo for the last track. A nice smooth and peaceful tone.    <br /> <br />Kudos to Britney on this album, It's my favorite album, along with her first one, \\"Baby One More Time.\\" She has accomplished a lot, and as a fan, I am truly really proud of her. :)... <br /> <br /> <br />

B00007KLJJ|5.0|In this new version of \\"The Four Feathers\\", Heath Ledger plays the part of William Favishion, a man who is trying to find his place. <br />Heath Ledger does a marvelous job, giving a very moving and emotional performance. <br />Wes Bentley, and Kate Blanchett, also star in this movie; both give good performances but it is clear that Wes Bentley outshines Kate Blanchett by far. <br />My quibble (and it is minor) is that there isn't the backstory with the father that you got in the Beau Bridges version. <br />However, the battle sequences are things of beauty, hundreds and hundreds of Arabs charge British soldiers and practically whip them out. <br />There is some language but not to the point of unecessary, unlike some other movies. <br />The thing that really moves me most about the movie, is how the characters truly care about each other, and have a love and respect for each other and for God. <br />I've heard that there is a lot more spirituality in this version of the tale, than in the oldest. <br />I don't know personally, because I haven't watched the oldest version. <br />Anyway, there is a sexual scene, but it is brief and there is no nudity. (It is still disappointing though). <br />I won't go into the movies storyline, simply because all of the other reviews already tell you about it. <br />I just want to give you a little bit more discription on the film's content. <br />Hope it was helpful

B00000JBCP|5.0|This CD is one of Mana's best.  If you like Spanish rock, this is the way to go.  It has rhythm and beat; it is definitely something you can dance and sing to.  On the other hand, there are a few songs that are great for easy listening. <br />I recommend this CD to anyone and everyone.  Even if you're not a rock fanatic, you will love it.  And who said you have to speak Spanish to listen to Spanish music?  Go for it!  But don't forget to listen to song #13, it is the type of song everyone likes. <br />
B00003CXCT|5.0|Lucas is updating the orginal three films (the middle three episodes) because he wants to link with the newer ones (the first three episodes to create a cohesive six-part series.  Don't forget, Lucas' original idea was a nine-part series.  He made what were the middle three parts of this epic and said he'd never make the other six.  Well, a long time later, technology had progressed to the point where Lucas was able to go back and make the first three parts.  Like them or not, the new films are episodes I, II and III, and are part of the Star Wars canon.  I can see why he wanted to go back again and update the original films so they would mesh with the newer ones; he is the creator of Star Wars and is his right.  If I had made Star Wars the way he did, I would do the same thing.  It's kind of silly to have two sets of movies that are parts of the same overall story not agree with each other.   The original films in an unchanged state, are, according to Lucas in a USA Today article about the DVD set, \\"dead\\" to him, so consider them gone; they're never going to be on DVD. <br /> <br />Judging from what I've read here and elsewhere, there are not that many changes to the original three films, aside from the technical fixes (like the matte line removal) that really were needed.  I mean, let's see what was added to episode 4 (I'll always call it \\"Star Wars\\" and not \\"A New Hope\\"):  1. Han and Greedo firing changed; if it has been changed again so they now fire at the same time, then it's ok with me.  2. Deleted scene with Jabba and Han added; looks like Jabba has been redone and is much improved over the \\"special edition\\" version, so no harm there.  One can debate over whether the scene itself needed to added.  3.  Deleted scene with Biggs added; didn't fans WANT to see that?  No harm there, though I think the scene disrupts the flow a bit.  4.  More \\"activity\\" in Mos Eisley; the scenes needed it, since the place always looked too dead for what is supposed to be a bustling spaceport.   And that's it, what so many are whining over--just a couple of minutes or so.  People, it's STILL Star Wars.  Most of it is still the same as it ever was--Vader is still evil, Luke still destroys the Death Star--but now looking real spiffy and with better sound.  As for the other two, \\"Empire\\" had the least changes done to it, and anything done to \\"Jedi\\" is a good thing. <br /> <br />Everyone has wanted the original three movies on DVD for a long time, and now they're here, and there's all this crying over minor bits.  Me, I'll be getting the set the day it comes out, and will be happy.
B0000VAFO0|4.0|it was great to watch this movie in the theatre. it had a somewhat predictable plot even for a hybrid movie. the action goes along the lines of the blade flicks, but without the smug remarks of whistler to lighten it up a bit. it was very, very dreary with almost all color stricken from the film, just the way a vampire or a werewolf story should be.<br /><br />the werewolves, or lycans as they are called, are represented as typically dumb creatures with only a few with slight intelligence. the vampires are exactly what you would expect from the people working at any hot topic store. the setting of gothic buildings and and just plain bleakness made it plainly obvious this was a nighttime movie. the special effects were about par with most other supernatural movies, but nothing really to complain about. the script was a little over the top, but that was what i was expecting. there was absolutely nothing spoken that didn't deal with the plot which was about the war between vampires and lycans. it would have made it a little more interesting if they would have added conversations that didn't consist of just the war, maybe add something outside the war.<br /><br />the weapons were those i had come to expect from the blade movies. ultraviolet bullets and silver shurikins. it was as if they were stealing straight from the blade mythology with that one. other then that the weapons were still nice in action.<br /><br />they don't specifically say when this movie is supposed to take place which adds to the timeless effect. they just say that this war has been waged for hundreds of years. i would say judging by the weaponry and vehicles, it would be in the next couple of decades, but who's to say?<br /><br />overall, good movie, little flaws but anyone who doesn't want to overemphisize on the flaws will enjoy. the flaws i would have to say are their only because of the previous myths made up by other writers and movie producers so they really aren't flaws at all if you just watch this movie from the perspective that it is a movie on its own.you just watch this movie from the perspective that it is a movie on its own.
B00005JMYG|5.0|I for one, unlike many reviewers here, thought this was one of the funniest movies that was made in 2004. People may pass this off as \\"stupid\\" slapstick humor, which is true in for the most part, but the basis for this comedy is genius.<br /><br />The 70s anchor man is funny to begin with. Not to mention they poke fun at all the ignorance that was displayed by most people in the 70s. Such as littering, acceptance of sexual harassment, style of clothing, hair and a number of other corny things that we remember from the 70s, even if you weren't alive then.<br /><br />This is filled with an incredible cast, and pushes satirical humor to the limits. Don't listen to all your idiot friends who says it sucks, just because they didn't get the satire. If the basis of the movie sounds funny to you, you will probably like it. It's a smart comedy. I know it had me tears.
B000286RJI|4.0|first the flaws.once again,the dead baby thing is no good.the end kind of sucks.it ends with them laughung together.besides one interesting story about superman,the final scene is a letdown.the story,carried over from the first part,has uma killing off the remaining people on her list including a redneck and a chick with one eye.that was a good fight.theres a bad ass burial scene that gave me the creeps big time too.then it goes back and shows her and some blind oriental dude from the skittles commercial who trains her.he treats her very poorly.then onto bill.the kids really shouldnt watch it due to rather innappropriate additions to thier vocabulary and graphic violence.quenten tarentinois your director,so you know its a godsend of a movie.i think it is better than the first one.i really liked the first one too.action fans and martial arts fans will probably like this one te most.it is emotionaly charged but the emotions are poorly in the last scene.umathurman is pretty hot.she has a very pretty face when shes buried.i know that sounds sick,but when shes in her casket shes pretty.that dude from kung fu the legends continues is bill.hes been in a bunch of cool movies like death race 2000 and cannonball run.the most intense part is when uma is buried alive.very spooky.i guess there cant be a kill bill 3.an excellent film.like i said,if it wasnt for the crappy final scene and the whole dead baby thing,it would have got a 5 star rating.
B000268QB2|5.0|Sure, I hear a tad of Beatles, a bit of ELO, even some Queen similarities in \\"Hopes and Fears\\".  But Coldplay doesn't come close to the beautifully interwoven tapestry of layer upon layer of gloriously haunting music that is KEANE.  (All music is derivitave if you go back far enough.)  This band has succeeded in creating a place to call their own.  They need no comparisons, because (frankly) there really aren't any.   <br /> <br />\\"Hopes and Fears\\" is a masterpiece of delicate wording and matching gentle infusions of soft and lovely chording, rising perfectly to crescendos of pure power and raw emotion.  Some have said it is rather boring and needs to \\"rock out\\" more, but that is not KEANE...that's what makes this Band a treasure.  If you want head-banging, heavy metal, stadium sound, fine (I love that music as well).  But for a beautiful, contemplative and emotion-grabbing change of pace, something to make your heart SOAR...KEANE is your answer.  These young men have REAL musical genius and I only hope they don't stray far from the magic that moves the soul in \\"Hopes and Fears\\".  You need to take a listen to the entire album to learn that there's more than one way to \\"rock out\\".  If you are not blown away, at least you listened before passing judgement.
B00003CX8I|4.0|amazon only lets us review one part of a whole set so theres a better chance youll buy more stuff if you like the first review.i guess theyre more interested in $ than the freedom of speech and not ripping off its customers.so im going to review them both right here.in part one,wolverine who has acute senses,admantium blades and a extremely fast regenerative power is hurt and rescued by the x-men who are a team of highly evolved people with extraordinary talents.he was with rogue when he was recruited who can touch people and see there thoughts  and drains mutants abilities.thier leader is professer x.one of the guys from star trek.he is insanely telepathic.while there at mutant school,he meets cyclops with eye lasers and jean grey who also does the telepathic thing.theyre enemies are magneto who controls anything metal,sabretooth-a cat like he-man,toad with a very long and powerful tongue.like 4 or 5 feet and can throw people.magneto has a special machine that could suck all mutants powers into his captive rogue and then take over from there.a battle goes down up top the statue of liberty.then in the second part,which i give 5 stars,another bad mutant who works for magneto named mystique uses nightcrawlers9a good teleporting mutant]body to attack the white house so the x-men will get the blame.magneto who is trapped in a plastic prison pulls the iron in his guards blood to rip him apart and escapes.the guy who aided his escape is a big shot goverment type who wants the mutants dead.his son is a mutant who can control otheres minds.but the dad can control him with a special machine.so they try to use the kid to control professer x into using his cerebro invention to kill all mutants.theres a big fight,blahblah blah.mystique is totaly naked except for blue dye and little rubber suction thingys allover her body.sabretooth is played by the lucha libre star taylor mane.thats spanish for professinal wrestling.they are both good but 2 is way better.jean grey is a semi hotred head.if the creators really wanted to go over the top spectacular with this set theyd finish telling the story.jean grey does come back as an extremely powerful mutant called phoenix.she is powerful enough to take over the world but doesnt want to since shes good.but then she gets turned into the dark phoenix.also ,there are many many cool characters not even explored yet.theres juggernaut-a giant kind of like hulk but smarter.apocalypse-a more powerful and giant version of the t-1000 from terminater 2.giant robotic mutant hunters called sentinals.the blob-a giant fat guy whose mirth absorbs most any blow.longshot-a good guy who has incredible luck all the time.archangel-with paralytic darts and razor wings.the beast-more agile than spider man,genius and colored a lot like sullivan from monsters inc.havoc-he can concentrate something and blow stuff up.even a mountain if he really really tried.gambit can charge things and use them explosively.bobby drake from part 2 later becomes a far more powerful ice man.firestar who shoots fire.a lot like pyro in part 2.there are many many more too.at least 30.they even travel to the future for numerous outstanding stories.my point being,while both of these movies rock!they could make at least 3 more totaly awesome ones and a whole string of sequels some even involving psycic vampires and the like.wolverine did the best acting in part one but was outshined by pyro in the 2nd one.pyro can control flames.ie:in one scene he lights a lighter and uses it to blast a team of cops away so he can escape.that scene was the best scene of both parts.there is this subtle ww2 minority rise up against the white kind of undertone but its  expected with hollywood.in the best scene i talked about,wolverine gets shot in the head at point blank,hits the ground and is up within a minute.i guess the only star is the dude from star trek.so these are his 2 best movies.all his others suck.the special effects are very cool.pyro and nightcrawler put on some dazzling displays.ive already given some ideas for sequels but will recap.1-apocalypse vs the x-men,2-the dark phoenix saga,3-time travel to the vampire world of the future,4-sentinals vs the x-men,5-time travel story where the x-men are eventualy betrayed and wiped out by a friend,and even when the battled kang who in the very distant future rules the world and sets out to conquer all time!i give the real deal and the real deal is if you dont get all this and more youre getting screwed.
B000021XR5|5.0|This is a great rock album.  A very solid, straight to the point album that lacks the grunge feel which the other STP releases before it had (not that that's a good or bad thing).  As with all of STP's albums, this album cannot be compared to any of the 3 before it or the 1 after it.  STP has their own sound, but they don't recycle anything to make a new album.  The album start off with \\"Down\\", which is a good, hard song to start, and then follows with 2 more heavy hitters in \\"Heaven and Hot Rods\\" and \\"Pruno\\".  But for those of you who also like the lighter side of rock, \\"Sour Girl\\" is a great \\"ballad\\" of sorts.  STP is a great band, and very underrated as far as talent goes.  If you like an album that can kick you in your teeth, but also have some soft moments, then this album is for you.
B00004T9UF|5.0|The albulm Marshall Mathers LP is filled with platnium singles such as Stan, The Way I am, THe Real Slim Shady, and many more.  Another thing that I enjoy about the album is that the songs that are not played on the radio are just as good as the hits.  THe albulm has a varity of songs ranging from songs like Stan which are understanding of how life is.  Then there is aggressive songs like Kim which is graphically Violent.  I don't think people should take all of his lyrics literally but he does post some good thoughts.  People need to sort out his lyrics to figure what should be taken literally and not literally.
B00003CXCT|5.0|Supreme thanks to the reviewer who gave the address thedigitalbits.com in regards to the highly anticipated DVD release of the Star Wars Trilogy(I RECOMMEND FANS/NON-FANS OF THIS NEW EDITION GO TO THIS SITE, READ THE REVIEW, AND VIEW THE OLD SCENE/NEW SCENE COMPARISONS BEFORE JUDGING THESE \\"VERSIONS\\" PREMATURELY).  I, like most, was(and still am)looking forward to a crisp restoration and remastering of the original trilogy, and the now first special edition trilogy on DVD with a feast of bonus materials.  I wasn't even aware of more changes being made to the Trilogy until about a week or so ago.  At first I became really ticked and irritated at the news, I don't even consider myself close to the degree of fan some claim to be, but I'm a fan of things original, and in the case of Star Wars, I would prefer the originals over modified versions.      With me the bottom line is film preservation.      Here it is fans/folks in my opinion, George Lucas is an artist, and I know a little bit about that, and as an artist it is rare that you are ever satisfied with your work, and that's something an unaware fan base will never understand. Now, what the artist forgets is that when he/she releases a piece of art to the masses and that art reaches a status of worship, the artist must always be aware, that any changes to the original piece will invoke passionate questions and mass uproar. (Eventually Lucas should stop \\"doctoring\\" his films, they were great to begin with.)     Should Lucas have released the original trilogy?  In my opinion YES!      Should Lucas have released the special edition trilogy? YES!     Should Lucas have released the original/special edition in this first DVD release?  Again YES!    I think most would agree with this.    It's amazing the impact and influence (whatever the version) these films have on people.    Anyway I will buy this version (again it's not the version I prefer) partly just to see what DVD technology, film restoration and remastering is really capable of doing with these movies. I truly feel the heart and essence of what made these films magical and great to begin with will still be there, not to mention the majority of the original work.     In my humble opinion, to own and view(again for some of us) films that are already making history(even before the DVD hits the stores)and what could later be of significant historical importance in regards to film, filmmaking, film doctoring, and possibly something beyond film itself, means more to me in the long term than what my current feelings about its missing or added contents may dictate.    Is Lucas and 20th Century Fox making money off of OUR emotions,  OUR nostalgia, and OUR comments by re-releasing EPISODES IV-VI with or without the original films?  YOU BETTER BELIEVE IT...NEVER FORGET THAT IT'S A NUMBERS GAME. (SAD BUT TRUE)    The original Trilogy, uncut, restored and remastered will have it's debut on DVD, I have complete faith in this. Lucas seems to specialize in building anticipation and hype in regards to these films.      Just look at the history of hype that surrounds Star Wars.  Look at the Official/Unofficial Web sites of Star Wars fans and devotees around the world.  Controversy is king(and a clever marketing tool)whether George Lucas consciously chooses to be controversial or not.    Wouldn't it be interesting though if the original versions of each movie were hidden as a special little Easter Egg within each disc, [A third version of TERMINATOR 2 was found on the TERMINATOR 2: ULTIMATE EDITION disc and was never mentioned anywhere on the actual DVD or in press reports (from what I remember) at the time, you had to input a code to find it.]    Anyway I will soon own what will probably be the best selling DVD Box Set of our current year and possibly next few years, plus to get some extras not guranteed to be on future releases(you know they'll be some.)      Old School Thought, relax, THE ORIGINAL TRILOGY WILL HAVE ITS DAY(it may secretlybe here now)....New School Thought, enjoy the releases, but I ask you to take the time to learn a little more about the appreciation of things of the past, and understand the passion of the \\"old schools\\" way of thinking.     I have hope that both 'schools of thought' will eventually get what they want.    Are Lucas and 20th Century Fox milking us out of our money?  (ONLY AS MUCH AS WE ALLOW OURSELVES TO BE MILKED)    As a consumer exercise your power to purchase/not purchase.    Whether we the global fan base purchase this DVD set or not, on SEPTEMBER 21, 2004, history will be made in some form or another in regards to this (FIRST)official release of STAR WARS 'SPECIAL EDITION' TRILOGY on DVD.  I ask the fans and devotees, WHAT WILL YOUR PART BE IN IT?        I will cultivate patience to such a degree, that time itself will grow tired of waiting.
B0000029DD|5.0|Everytime I saw the front cover picture of Grace on it's original release in the mid 90's I was intrigued by it and kept promising myself to check the album out but never did. Then by mistake I got hold of a track off it from a friend (it was mis-labelled) the track was 'Last Goodbye' and I was smitten. Next came 'Hallelujah' so beautiful and heartbreaking at once. <br />Then 'Lover, you should've come over' and the fabulously down and dirty 'Eternal life' I finally bought the album and wouldn't be without it in this life or the next.
B00001U0GQ|4.0|Very sorry all those excellent moments that were in the original movie are excluded. Why can't we get a DVD with the original movie on it? Please?!?
B0000AQVCL|4.0|I landed into this musical pastiche a almost a year after its original release and I can hear an Oasis influence loud and clear. Definitely also sounds of the Rolling Stones, AC/DC, Black Crowes and Aerosmith are to be found in here. Under normal circumstances, I would discard an album that can't make up its own mind, but I admit that the catchy \\"Are You Gonna Be My Girl\\" hooked me a while back, so I gave the album a shot.<br /><br />What I've found in \\"Get Born\\" is that most of the upbeat tracks I dig: as a matter of fact, I enjoy them a lot, perhaps because I was first deep into classic rock before listening to other types of music. However, the ballads I could totally live without: a couple of them want to sound like the Rolling Stones and don't go beyond coming across as a ripoff of Poison. The closing track, \\"Timothy\\", though on the lighter side of the spectrum, I enjoyed as well.<br /><br />So the balance seems like a fair 3.5 stars, leaning toward 4 stars. I will most definitely keep my eyes open for any coming works by these Melbourne-based rockers!
B00028HBKM|2.0|I've been debating on how I should approach this review, as it may: a) anger someone, or b) make people think things about me that are untrue. This is my disclaimer: Jesus Christ is my personal Lord and Savior, I believe in him with all of my heart and would love nothing more than to bring all those I come into contact with towards his love.    That Being said...    The recent movie \\"The Passion of the Christ,\\" as directed by Mel Gibson attempts to show the suffering Christ went through during the final 12 hours of his life. Gibson has claimed constantly that he lifted the entire story straight from the Bible (save perhaps some of the non-biblical dialogue, which is OK). However, this is hardly the case, and in the end the movie ends up being nothing but Mel's personal story of how he thinks things should have happened, and for any person educated on things such as the Bible, Crucifixion, basic Biology and a bit of history would find the movie wildly inaccurate, and not worth the price of admission-that is unless you are soul searching.    Even if you are soul searching, I would sincerely hope that would want something a bit more accurate, and to not be mislead by the slew of `artist license' this production takes.    I will start with the most obvious-The actor playing Jesus (while he does a wonderful job) looks more like some Hippie from the 60's than a 1st Century Jew.    Let's face it people-Jesus did not look anything like that image we are all brought up with. He was Jewish, and likely had rather dark skin (remember-he was hidden in Egypt for the first years of his life, and would need to have a darker complexion to not raise suspicion [he was being hunted by King Herod]). He also, in all likelihood, did NOT have long hair. That's right, I said did not. Why do I say that? Simple-the New Testament says that a man with long hair in those times is a shame unto his family.     Would one of Jesus' disciples have said that if Jesus had had long hair?    Furthermore,Judas had to kiss Jesus to show the guards which one in the group was Jesus, meaning he had a look similar to all of his disciples, whom were all Jewish, and likely had short haircuts, dark skin and beards.    Next up to the plate is Pontius Pilate.     His part in the movie was FAR too sympathetic to the cause of Jesus. While I will admit, he may have been willing to acquit Jesus (as he left the decision to the Jews between Jesus and Barrabus), he was more concerned about his own positions of power than of some supreme moral choice that may save his soul.    The film is not overtly Anti-Semetic, it just portrays Pontius Pilate as being way to kind.    The scene in which Jesus is flogged with the cat-o-nine tails starts out decently enough. They beat him with canes something terrible, but not over the top. It's when the infamous cat-o-nine tails comes out that things go crazy.     Blood-EVERYWHERE. I started thinking that Quentin Tarintino had directed this scene in the movie because a) anyone beaten that much would have passed out in real life and b) anyone with that many DEEP wounds (ribs were showing, people) would have bled to death in a very short time. The amount of blood on the ground would have made even the most hearty, healthy man pass out and likely die from blood loss.    When I said ribs were showing, I don't mean you could almost make out a piece of bone-I mean there was an entire patch of skin/muscle tissue missing. His calves and legs where torn to pieces (how could ANYONE walk like that?), and the crown of thorns looked as if it might have gouged out his right eye (which was understandably swollen shut).    The most blatant of all of the historical errs is probably the fact that King Herod is portrayed in the film. King Herod?? He died in 3BC!?! What the? Is this \\"Passion of the Christ: In Time\\"? Was Michael J. Fox originally cast to play Jesus? Not only was Herod in the movie-he was a flamboyant younger man! C'mon Mel!    Finally (of the stuff I can remember at the moment, and there is much debate about this) the nails were driven through his hands in the movie. My belief is that they were driven through his wrists, and here is why:    Traditional Roman Crucifixion had the victim nailed through the wrist for 2 main reason-to help support the weight of the body (as suffocating is the way one generally died (which is why they went to break everyone's legs in the movie)-the tissue in the hands just isn't strong enough. AND-when a nail is driven through the wrist in the right place, it pinches a key nerve producing and extraordinary amount of pain (you know, that nerve that makes the funny-bone not so funny).    In those days, the `palm' included all of the arm from the finger tips to the building the elbow (on the side of what we now call the palm).    Also, driving nails through his actual hand would have broken bones-which goes against the prophecy (as far as I know).    I think that's all I can think of for now.    The end was the high point of the movie (and no, not because it was over) but because you actually see a resurrected Jesus, which was quite warming.
B0000931QR|4.0|It's been a bit since Oreja de Van Gogh (translated as Van Gogh's Ear) released this exquisite album, and it sounds just as fresh to the ear (to ours, not Van Gogh's) now as it did back in 2003. The international ambassadors of Spanish Pop scored their biggest success to date with this album, one that blends in a very eighties-like sound (perfect timing) with Amaia's beautiful voice (one that reminds of Ana Torroja more often than not, with \\"Rosas\\" being the best example of this).<br /><br />Granted that the lyrics or the music are nowhere near Mecano's words over fifteen years ago, tracks such as \\"Puedes Contar Conmigo\\", \\"Un Mundo Mejor\\", \\"Deseos de Cosas Imposibles\\" and \\"Historia De Un Sue&ntilde;o\\" make me feel that Spanish Pop is doing well and in pretty good hands.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|The third Slipknot release put me into shock when I heard how they have changed both musicly and lyricly.  The previous two Slipknot releases were a little more over the edge and overall heavier.  The third album shows a less agressive side of Slipknot that we have not seen before.  In songs like \\"Duality\\" and \\"Vermilion,\\" you wont hear the screeching guitar and booming base drums, however you will hear more harmonic instrumentals and singing rather than screaming.  Do not let this turn you off to this album.  There is still plenty of typical Slipknot on this cd that all of the die hard fans will still enjoy.  Songs like \\"The Blister Exists,\\" \\"Three Nil,\\" and \\"Opium Of The People,\\" show this. I was one of the biggest Slipknot fans before this cd came out, and now I am an even bigger one.  I have seen them live three times in the last 6 months.  Do see this cd as Slipknot going soft.  Take a minute and view it for what it really is.  This cd is the best Slipknot release yet, because they have developed and changed their style and have become better musicians.  This cd is a great buy and is worth every penny.
0312955006|5.0|\\"The Concrete Blonde\\" is Michael Connelly's third book, was first published in 1994 and - like his previous two - features Harry Bosch as its central character. A little of Bosch's background, and many of his quirks, have been touched onin the previous two books. He's a jazz fan, with a taste for coffee, beer and cigarettes. Having served as a Tunnel Rat in Viet-Nam, he' returned home and joined the police force. Bosch currently works at the Hollywood Division's Homicide table, though he had once been a member of the LAPD's elite RHD (Robbery - Homicide Division). The last case he worked in RHD, about four years previously, had been the \\"Dollmaker Case\\". Harry and his colleagues were hunting a serial killer, whose afvoured victims were prostitutes. The case was closed when Harry shot and killed Norman Church, the leading suspect. As a result of his actions, however, Bosch was investigated by IAD (Internal Affairs Division), suspended for a month and 'demoted' to his current position.  <br /> <br />The Dollmaker Case resurfaces in this book. Bosch and the Police Department are being sued by Church's widow, claiming that her husband was innocent and that Harry had killed the wrong man. Her lawyer is Honey Chandler, a civil rights attorney who specialises in police abuse cases. Bosch meanwhile - like the police department - have no doubt that Church was the Dollmaker, and \\"good\\" for the eleven killings. Unfortunately, for Bosch there's a fly in the ointment. Just as the trial starts, a new body is found buried beneath a concrete slab in a derelict building. The directions to it were contained in a note delivered to Harry's station - not only does it claim responsibility for the murder, but it also matches some other notes attributed to the Dollmaker. Obviously, this raises some very awkward questions - most notably, is the Dollmaker still alive ? If so, Bosch is obviously in a lot of trouble with his court case. There are other possibilities, though - the Dollmaker mayhave been working with another killer, or there may be a copycat. Bosch must not only deal with the court case, but assist in the investigation.  <br /> <br />Like Connelly's previous two books - \\"The Black Echo\\" and \\"The Black Ice\\" - I found this to be a very enjoyable book : it's possibly the best of the three. I would, however, recommend reading the three in order. The previous books will cover some parts of Harry's life and career that are referred to in this book - for example, his mother's life and death, his history with Irving, how he met Sylvia Moore and the nature of their relationship. Knowing the \\"full story\\" will add to the enjoyment of this installment. The other books are very enjoyable also - reading them will be anything other than a burden !
B000069AUI|5.0|This is a good CD. Every track is worthy, and pleasing to listen to. I love Clocks, and the scientist. Its a good slow rock music. This is one of the few CD's that i can listen to straight through without skipping a track. I love the bands use of the piano. I love the sound and the rythm of there music. This is the greatest CD i own
076790592X|5.0|Once in awhile we come across a teacher that makes a \\"difference\\" in our life. Morrie, a college professor, was that teacher to Mitch. After graduation, Mitch had lost contact with Morrie. However, things soon changed after Mitch learned about Morrie's illness. The lessons learned by Mitch from his Tuesday visits with his old professor were helpful to everyone who had the opportunity to read the book. There were tears, but his wise professor showed his former student how to really LIVE, even when Morrie was dying. There are lessons for everyone in this book. \\"Tuesdays with Morrie\\" is one of the best books I have ever read. It was filled with love, courage, compassion, and wisdom.
0385336810|4.0|I was so excited to read the newest book by Sophie Kinsella as I LOVE the Shopaholic series.  This was not as good, but still quite enjoyable.<br /><br />It's fun to see how this book runs through the course of time.  Why certain things happen, when they do happen and how its resolved.  It's fairly predictable, but still enjoyable.<br /><br />Overall, I recommend if you enjoy the Shopaholic books, I don't think you'll be dissapointed as long as you're not expecting a clone of the former character.
1592400876|4.0|This acerbic, often hilarious British bestseller guides readers through the rules and guidelines of punctuation.  Not to be confused with a grammar book (although grammar does come into play),  this short treatise concentrates solely on the marks used to manage sentences in the English language. Author Lynne Truss is a self-proclaimed \\"stickler\\" when it comes to punctuation, a person who will run down the street screaming at the sight of a misplaced apostrophe, and she provides clear, unambiguous rules to combat such situations.  In addition to explaining the hard-and-fast rules, she acknowledges the gray areas of usage.  For example, in her section on commas, she explains the importance of properly dividing a sentence as well as the discretionary nature of the mark, citing an amusing exchange between James Thurber and his conservative editor that highlights issues of clarity and artistic intention.  The use of a comma for rhythm and emphasis within a sentence is a topic few style manuals discuss, and I appreciated the author's attention to this less understood application.<br /><br />To Truss's enormous credit, she enlivens the traditionally dry subject matter with outrageously funny examples and a wit that could cut the Queen herself down to size. She illustrates the proper use of the colon and semi-colon.  She talks about comma splices, question marks, periods (or, in British English, \\"full stops\\"), exclamation points, dashes, quotation marks, and apostrophes.  Thankfully, she also points out where American rules differ from the British lest we all end up confused when corresponding internationally.  Her coverage is comprehensive and clear.<br /><br />For those who second-guess themselves, this book can be an invaluable (and painless) guide to correct usage.  Most people comfortable writing in English won't find many surprises - save a historical fact or two - but the sheer fun of the book is worth every minute.  From high school students to octogenarians, readers will find this a delightful exploration of a much-neglected aspect of writing.  I highly recommend this book for sticklers and fumblers alike.this a delightful exploration of a much-neglected aspect of writing.  I highly recommend this book for sticklers and fumblers alike.

B00005JMEW|2.0|Tarantino has always had a thing for violence. His movies \\"Reservoir Dogs\\" and \\"Pulp Fiction\\" and his screenplay for \\"Natural Born Killers\\" are full of violence. Kill Bill is no different. For those not interested in violence this movie isn't worth watching. <br /> <br />The aforementioned movies are very good for another reason; their excellent screenplays really make the movie that much better, the violence is usually just a part of the overall story. Now it's the other way; the violence is the main part, the story is flimsy at best. <br /> <br />I have seen numerous Asian movies over the years and Kill Bill reminded me of them. \\"Crouching Tiger\\" for example is based on a trashnovel and Kill Bill could be the same. For some reason the Asians can still make movies like this a lot better. <br /> <br />The fight scenes are good, but again not as good as can be. <br /> <br />If this movie was made as an ode to Asian kung-fu movies he really pulled it off because they are very similar, but American this time.  <br /> <br />See \\"Hero\\" instead, a movie Tarantino helped to be made.
B000003C2U|5.0|Death's &#62;human, is in my opinion by far, the best album ever release by a deathmetal band...With good reasons, the production,lirycs, sound,and how originaly it truly is and as a fan of this genre after so many years that makes me very proud. Any one who loves metal and dont have any death albums yet? Commit suicide !
B0002V7ODI|4.0|While not quite as good as the original Superman , or the 2 Spidey movies, it's almost up there with them. Full of effects and action, yes, but the movie has a hell of an emotional impact. A good amount of time is taken to develop the Hellboy/Liz relationship ( along with the father/son angle) and both pay off in spades. I have to rate this very high, it's funny, fun, and emotional. Whatever story or villain shortcomings the movie has, the final shot is powerful and satisfying. It tops Xmen 2 , due to the well-drawn main characters.<br /><br />Highly recommened for a goofy, sweet good time!<br /><br />I'd never read the Hellboy comics, but knew of them.
038551123X|4.0|Darkly Dreaming Dexter is a twisted novel, funny in a black way, but never goes over the line of good taste.  Dexter Morgan is a self-admitted serial killer (but, if it is possible, he's a \\"good\\" serial killer, as he explains right up front).  By day, he is a blood spatter expert in Florida--which brings him in contact with a horrible serial killer loose in Miami.  His adoptive sister is a police officer involved in the case, who sees this case as her ticket out of vice and into the more prestigous world of homicide detective.  So we have police politics and serial killer gore.  Dexter is a disarming protagonist,  you will find yourself actually liking him because he is so funny.  His social observations are brilliantly on target, viciously wicked.  The novel is a wonderful, refreshing take on the police procedural formula.  If you like your humor a little on the dark side, this novel will entertain and amuse you.
067101756X|3.0|I liked this book for its overall recap of what did happen out in the desert in 47' but lets remember this IS written by a man who claims to be a part of the very cover up we need to be rid of.  To me this is a good read although not the book to read if it is your first exposure to this subject.  I found it to be layered with Truth and disimformation at the same time.  Example, Corso always talks of the Aliens being Hostile yet there are zero examples of Hostility other than to state that the UFO's would &quot;Buzz&quot; our Space craft and fly over our Military bases.  Well Birds fly over military bases as well yet we do not call them hostile.  Shooting down a Space shuttle in my eyes would be hostile.  Also Corso makes the point a few times that NASA was given complete control over the Space related issues and the Army could not get a thing done for them by NASA.  Thats all fine in a perfect world but anyone in the know knows that to be a part of NASA in most cases you need a Military background with some sort of security clearance.  I wonder how much was written by Corso and how much by William J. Birnes who is credited with some of the writting.  I certainly couldn't discern what was his and what was Corso's.  Either way you look at this book It is fascinating although not worth too much consideration seeing as it deals with such a small portion of this enormous subject.  Final thought..........  If Aliens are so Hostile as Corso claims over and over then why have they watched us build a more sophistcated and strong society since 1947.  All the while &quot;Buzzing&quot; us from inside there craft.  Why not attack when we were in our Millitary Infancy.  We certainly would have been an easy Target when we had only a dozen or so Nukes, Now we have enough to Kill Worlds...........Maybe to a Military man Hostility is like the new kid at school, If he's bigger than you he's hostile, at least until he comes over and says hello.

B00003CXCT|5.0|My DVD set arrived Saturday!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I watched all of them on my friend's home theater system which is an actual 10ft by 16ft screen with a THX certified surround setup and the picture and sound quality is unreal. It was better than watching it at a theater. The colors are bright and vibrant, the sound is crisp and clean, sounds coming at you from every direction. I was in heaven. <br /> <br />Everyone that buys them will definitely enjoy watching them with or without the theater setup. I watched on my regular setup at home (smaller screen but with surround) and it was great there to. The extras are great to. <br /> <br />Yes it is different than the originals and I agree he should release them but he is not going to. If you want the originals you buy them on DVD (bootleg) from ebay pretty cheap, which I did and they are better than the VHS versions. The ones I have where mastered from the \\"Definitive Collection\\" which is the best made original versions out there and it looks and sounds great. I also have the \\"Definitive Collection\\" laser disc set which I also watched on the big home theater system and it looks and sounds ALMOST as good as the new DVDs.
B0002S94OS|5.0|Two grossly oversized thumbs way up! This album is amaingly brutal and better than any other lamb of god release to date. These guys are taking metal into the mainstream by making their first major label release one of this caliber. They definetly didn't give into the pop-rock aspect of being signed to a major label, nor did they lighten their sound up at all. This cd will rip you open, feast upon your entrails, and then poop them out... metaphorically speaking..
B0000025JT|5.0|Guilty was the first Gibb-related record I actually bought.  My mom refused to pay $1.99 for the lp and asked, \\"Who is that guy on the cover with her, anyway?\\" I explained it was Barry Gibb producing this one for Barbra and mom answered, \\"Oh, now I know why you want it.\\" Oddly enough, I found the cassette at a thrift store, too!<br /><br />  Barry won all kinds of cudos and Grammys for this album, even though audiences in 1980 swore The Bee Gees were passe and disco was by gone.  The lead off duet Guilty was written by Barry, Robin, and Maurice, the only track here penned by all three of the boys.  Should I even try and count all the hooks, lines, and sinkers in this one?  The song fits Barbra perfectly, and yet Barry is in tune also. Who hasn't tried to sing along with this one?  If it's possible to get more excellent with this song, listen to the brothers' live snippets of Guilty from One Night Only or Live By Request.<br /><br />  This album isn't quite like anything else Barbra Streisand has done, but Woman In Love comes close to her prior work.  It suits her moody dark style yet has a Gibb touch too it.  I have some of the demos for this album, but I don't listen to them often.  Barry sounds just a bit too shrill on the demos.  Barbra's version of Love however has that grand epic feel to it.<br /><br />  Run Wild and Promises are the first two songs presented that were written by Barry and Robin.  I'd like to say I can hear something different or a touch of Robin somewhere, but I honestly can't.  Run Wild does have some unique lyrics and just sounds very beautiful.  Indeed the boys crafted the songs around Barbra's voice.  She really belts on this one.<br /><br />  Promises is to me the one noticable `depature' track.  Okay maybe this one does have a bit of a Robin feel.  It seems off beat compared to everything else, and it almost sounds as if Barbra is in a bit of a lower voice.  It works superbly when she shoots back up to herself. Just the word Promises and the way she says it will get stuck in your head.<br /><br />  Last on Side A is The Love Inside, which might be my favorite track.  It's the only song written by just Barry and his lyrics are on form.  Barbra's delivery, however, takes this to the next level.  Sometimes this album she can be tough to understand, but on The Love Inside, what needs to be understood is so, and what you can't quite make out, mood, music, and imagination take care off.  These few minutes tell us its okay to step back from our busy lives, relax, and yes, stop and think about love! ;0)<br /><br />  What Kind of Fool is the second duet on the album and was penned by Barry with Albhy Galuten, as are the last two tracks.  Fool is not as commercial as Guilty, and isn't even as much of a duet. It does, however, sound the most like a Bee Gees tune.  It's very dark and balladeering.  It's unrepetitive and the interlude kicks it up a notch.<br /><br />  The third Barry and Robin penned tune Life Story is next.  It has a lot of booming music and crescendos from Barbra and I can really picture her on a rooftop belting this one to somebody who's done her wrong.  Is that just me?<br /><br />  Never Give Up is what I consider the fast track on the album.  Barbra almost rapping is definately what no one expected on this tune, but the chorus is very Broadway styled.  Barry's next project should be a show based on this album.  Parts of this song you can't help but sing along too.<br /><br />  Make It Like A Memory ends the album in big Broadway production fashion. It starts off slow, then turns it up.  Although  not saying the name of a song is annoying when you don't know the title,  Barbra's delivery of the long awaited title line in this one is worth it.  My one nitpick with the song is the ending.  It just drags on and on and fades into the distance.  Maybe there is some sort of parallel to be drawn about remembering or the memory fading, I don't know.  I would rather have the song end on some of thebig booms and cymbals it's got in there, but did I win a Grammy for this stuff? No.<br /><br />  Guilty is the perfect album to have in case, just maybe, you want to hear a woman's voice and still have that awesome Gibb quality in lyrics, sound, and production.  Hey, hey, I said maybe.g end on some of the big booms and cymbals it's got in there, but did I win a Grammy for this stuff? No.   <br />    Guilty is the perfect album to have in case, just maybe, you want to hear a woman's voice and still have that awesome Gibb quality in lyrics, sound, and production.  Hey, hey, I said maybe.   <br />

0393035158|1.0|This book is a disappointment. While I share the writer's concern about the excesses of faith the book is ill organized, lacking in facts and like Steven Leackock's Lord Randolph is riding off in all directions. <br /> <br />I was very much looking forward to reading an intelligent review of how humanity might escape from the bounds of faith. The writer let me down in a big way. He starts off in a rather loose fashion against the three Abrahamic religions feeding us well known facts about inconsistencies in all three. We all agree - but where do we go from here? What do we give to the millions who were brought up in three millenia's worth of this tradition? <br /> <br />From this, sometimes cute but mostly superficial overview he takes off in all directions with most of the notes being further expansions of his unfortunately ill formulated views. The book fails to convince the serious reader, which is a pity because we share our basic convictions. But I was looking for a more learned and organized support of my concerned doubts. <br />
B0002MB7QW|1.0|Brought to you by the same people who dropped Godzilla and Independence Day on the American public. 2 of the worst films ever made. When will people learn that special effects should be secondary to the plot. If you can't compose a decent script, then chances are your film will suck...like this one.
B00000AD94|5.0|I was listening to Liquid Tension Experiment, Dream Theater, Rush, and Yes as the extent of my progressive rock listening, with a bit of Genesis and King Crimson thrown in there.  I loved LTE and stuff like that, compared that and similar bands to modern neo-rush or something like that.   <br /> <br />Spock's Beard went the other way of the spectrum progrock wise, going neo-yes.  Which is awesome.  While I love the complex rhythms and riffs of LTE, I love the complex lyrics, long suites, and organ melismas that spock's beard offers.  This was the first Spock's Beard album I bought, and I am glad I bought it.  It makes me want to get another album by them, because it was different than anything I ever heard. <br /> <br />The only \\"problem\\" I have with it is it is SO complex in everything it does, that you can't listen to it that often.  It is one of those albums that you don't listen to for a while, then take it out and say \\"Oh yeah this was a great album\\" <br /> <br />I can only imagine that every album after this is better, since this was their debut and it was awesome.  I don't quite give it 5 stars, but 4 stars seems way too low.  4.5 stars.
B00005JMUA|5.0|Tarantino's many, varied, and devoted fans had to get used to a slightly new Tarantino film in \\"Kill Bill, Vol. 1.\\"  While Tarantino has always had a love for action sequences, most of his films were heavier on the dialogue than the fisticuffs.  Not so in \\"Vol. 1,\\" which skewed much more towards the action side of the scale.  Sure, the trademark quips and pop-culture references were there, but the movie was defined by its over-the-top violence. <br /> <br />\\"KB Vol. 2\\" represents a return to form for Tarantino (yes, it's an extension of the same film, but since had to pay two ticket prices, they are two films), with the dialogue once again returning to the forefront.  From the opening narrative, essentially working as the Chorus reintroducing the audience to the film after a long intermission, to several great scenes with the lethal Bill (David Carradine, in a performance that makes us wonder why we haven't seen much, much more of this guy), this film is a refreshing return to Tarantino's incredible pseudo-70's jargon and speechifying. <br /> <br />Tarantino's fans are also always checking his films for references to other flicks.  Overt references include \\"The Searchers\\" in addition to homages to Tarantino's other movies, and they do not disappoint.  While Volume 1 was entertaining, I suspect that Volume 2 will receive more replays, if only because the tale is a bit more complex.  <br /> <br />The film does not have the audacious Japanese anime sequence used with such great effectiveness in Volume 1, but Tarantino includes an even more daring shot from inside a coffin as the occupant is buried alive (look for the exhumed corpse to play a little shadow-puppet game during the gravedigging scene).   <br /> <br />While Tarantino has said that he is interested in the idea of bringing back Vernita Green's daughter (from Volume 1) for a future revenge drama, I think the better chance for a spin-off character is the character who finishes the film without eyeballs.  The \\"Blind Swordsman\\" is one of the most beloved Japanese action heroes, and this character would be a perfect vehicle for Tarantino to give us his take on that legend.   <br /> <br />Top-notch performances abound in this film . . . Uma Thurman remains at the top of her game, the remaining survivors of DiVAS are pitch-perfect, and (again), David Carradine just plain steals the picture as an articulate, seductive, incredibly mean s.o.b. <br /> <br />A must for fans of QT's previous efforts.  The extras on the DVD are pretty good, but you should buy this one for the film, not the bonus stuff.
B000002J09|5.0|Everyone who loves this album has talked about the great blues/rock rythym on this album, so I won't rehash that dialogue.  Rather, I'd like to respond to those anti-Zeppelin fanatics.    Zeppelin are not rip off artists or sell outs.  I own Robert Johnson's 2 disc set (recorded in the 30's) and most of Muddy Waters and a host of other blues artists who Zeppelin supposedly ripped off.  Yes there are guitar riff here and there that they heard and used, and yes there's lyrics they lifted (\\"juice running down my leg\\") was a direct pull off of Robert Johnson.    But you can't begin to appreciate the difference between what they \\"lifted\\" and what ends up as the produced song. (...)  If you think the Zeppelin version sounds anything like this version, you need your ears checked.    Robert Plant said in an NPR interview, that he thought they were doing nothing different than all the other artists before them.  You hear other great music, you incorporate it into your music and the music evolves from one generation to the next.   One can argue that Zeppelin wasn't truely original, and I would concur with that statement.      Picasso once said that talent borrows and genius steals.  In this regard, Led Zeppelin are geniuses!
0446677450|5.0|I read this book and found the information very fascinating.  It made me take a long look at my finances and readjust my situation to reap the rewards that were long overdue.  Colleges don't educate its students about the positives and negatives of money, but this man, from experience, have compiled a strong approach to these two means.  The book is meant for readers to take a look at what can be achieved with a good education, hard work, and a good paying job vs. hard work with a knowledgeable sense of working their money to become debt free. RECOMMENDED READING.

B00000IPAX|5.0|Blink 182 <br />Enema Of The State <br /> <br /> In my opinion Enema Of The State is one of the best CDs Blink has ever released. It has the perfect mix of songs, with unbelievable lyrics. <br /> This CD has many different songs that puts Enema Of The State one of my favorites.  For instance, the intro from the song \\"Dumpweed\\", the first track on the cd, is familiar to every one that has an appreciation for punk rock as one of the most popular intros in the last few years.  A few songs later they play \\"Going Away To College\\", which any college student I know can relate to; they describe young love through their lyrics in a way that you can feel, without making it too sappy.  Next, they hit it off with \\"What's My Age Again\\". I would like to think that everyone would agree on it being the most popular punk song of it's time.  For all of the real emotional people, there is a great track on this cd called \\"Adam's Song\\". I don't think I have ever herd a punk band come up with a song that is so deep and meaningful, it is defiantly one of my overall favorites.  <br /> Whether you are looking for Up beat and catchy, or slow and meaningful, it is defiantly one of my all time favorites CDs.  I truly believe this cd is the definition of great punk rock. <br />  <br />
B00000K0E5|4.0|I am not a huge fan of the Bond films (I normally watch them only if I'm in need of a huge laugh) but I decided to watch this particular movie because I am the world's biggest Sean Bean fan. I was not disappointed in ANY way. I grew up watching Pierce Brosnan as Remingon Steele and I have to say he does a really credible job as James Bond. In my mind, of course, he is overshadowed by Sean Bean's skillful portrayal of a villian with an actual reason for being so dastardly (gasp!). Goldeneye really came through on the plot, action, and character development I don't usually expect in this franchise. If you enjoy action movies in general, not just Bond movies, you should enjoy Goldeneye's fast pace, great effects, and really great scenery (wink, wink).
B00028HBL6|3.0|This movie was artistically well-done, the quality could not be better.  However, it is very curious to me that no one has yet spoken about the sign above Jesus on the cross.  \\"King of the worms.\\"  Not one discussion about this movie has acknowledged what this signs means or insinuates.  And the fact that the sign is not factual nor based on the Bible (as claimed by the producers that the movie in its entirety is), reinforces the question of the sign's meaning.  Regardless of what individuals' religious beliefs are, it is not for anyone's \\"higher good,\\" benefit, nor is it loving, to rehash past wrongdoings. If anyone can possibly be persuaded to believe in Jesus as our Savior, the best possible persuasian is by witnessing actions that match words.  Walk our talk. Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.  Stirring up animosity, blame, and trying to present a sense of superiority of one group of people to another... is not what I understand the Bible to teach.  Unfortunately, this movie seems to lean that way.  The focus should be on Jesus' purpose and teachings... not who killed who....  And further, the purpose of Jesus' death (if you should believe in the Bible as prophecy) is that it was prophecy.  God planned this... God used the Romans and Jews and whomever else was there at the time to participate....  God used the people to crucify Jesus.  The point isn't who did it and that they should be blamed... the point is that God wanted it to happen...  The whole intent of this movie seems to ignore Jesus' whole demeanor and desires for the human race.
B0000UJFCO|5.0|Wow! I love this band. This dvd I bought by luck at a local music store.  I just happened across it on the shelf and bought it hoping it would be ok. I've only recently gotten into Yes and really didn't know a thing about them other than their 80's album 90125. I love their music and have since purchased almost all their cd's and wanted to see them actually perform on stage. I'm a drummer and think that among other great percussionists and drummers, bill bruford and alan white are fantastic in their own right. I was immediately impressed with the clarity of the opening screen music &quot;Don't take love for granted&quot;. On my surround stereo it kind of threw me off guard and gave me goose bumps (the volume was up!). Then I actually watched the dvd and was mesmerized by the performance and quality of the entire production. Every member was featured quite equally (Alan White even gave a drum solo which of course made my day). Being a musician I can see that each member is a master of his instrument and how they act on stage is of no consequence to the power of their performance (just close your eyes and listen)they wre just having a little fun. They've been producing great music since the 60's so I think they deserve to have a litle fun on stage with their music and fans. Although i feel that Yes didn't really need a symphony to back them up, the young orchestra really added &quot;uumph&quot; to their sound and stage presence and in a couple of places I could tell that Yes enjoyed having them. Overall, this DVD made me wish I could have been there to see them live because if they sounded this good on DVD I think live would have been ten times the experience. I usually gauge how good a band is by hearing them perform live. If they sound just as good live as they do on the album without overproduction then I figure they are talented unlike a lot of today's &quot;techno-sleep&quot; bands with no real talent. If they sound even better live than on the albums then I consider them worth my money and time and this dvd is definitely worth my money and time.
B00005YU1O|5.0|As profound and verbose as it is, \\"Waking Life\\" never fails to intrigue me. Linklater enhances his reputation as a maverick and visionary. A lot of the stuff sounded silly, but it ALL made me think. Isn't this what original film is all about? It's episodic (Thank God!), and as such doesn't let any idea get more profound than it is. I was entertained and moved.
B00000J7JO|5.0|My favorite album is Californication by the Red Hot Chili Peppers, aka RHCP. RHCP is an alternative rock band. This particular CD has a lot of great beats in it that puts in a good mood. I got this CD in June of 2000 as a birthday gift from a friend. I still have the CD, but I converted it into MP3 format on my computer and listen to it on there. <br /> <br />Again it is amazing. If you like this type of music this CD is a must have.
B0001ADAVK|4.0|I've read some of the other reviews. All I can say is that this film was recommeded to me by a macho male friend. Though I am male, I relate to the perils that women faced thoughout most of history; the 50's were particulaly brutal for women, since anyone in position was scrutinized by McCarthyism. Wellesly College was no different. It's politics did not promote women, rather taught them how to be subservient. Some of my reviewing predecessors failed to realize how different things were then. There is absolutely NO comparison to \\"Dead Poets' Society\\", which was about ideas. \\"Mona Lisa Smile\\" is about integrity. Unfortunately, in both films, the protaganist left with his/her tail between the legs; Williams from defeat, Roberts from frustration. I'm a Julia Roberts fan, and think she's smart and interesting in almost any film she's made. She is bested here by Marcia Gay Harden, as well as the four young ladies who create her new world of involvement. The most famous 3 (Gyllenhaal, Stiles, Dunst) are fine, but Ginnifer Goodwin is a talent to be reckoned with. Harden, in particular, is so out of touch, and so sweet. Best performance in the film. I also liked Juliet Stevenson as the Lesbian (horrors!). A credit to her performance; she played the mother in \\"Bend It Like Beckham\\", who was appalled at the thought of gayness.The DVD is fine, with lots of extras. It must've been really awful to be a rich college girl in the 50's. A smart Lesbian couldn't work, and smart women were happy, relegated to idiot roles. This is a better film than most people think.
B0002858YS|4.0|This is an interesting CD.  I really like the music as it seems influenced by a variety of disparate artists, from modern day emo-punk groups, the Cure, U2, and a number of others.  The first 5 tracks amazing, particularly \\"Mr. Bright Side\\" and \\"These Things That I've Done\\".  However, while I could name and probably sing along to every one of those first five tracks, I'd be hard pressed to even name one of the remaining six tracks.  The songs are decent and easy enough to listen to, but they're nothing special.  However, the CD is still worth buying just for those first five tracks.  5 excellent songs out of an 11 track album is pretty good for a modern day album, it's just a bit unfortunate that they're all bunched together.  For a debut, it's an excellent CD and I am eagerly awaiting their follow-up.
074325144X|5.0|I recently started back to running for health and work reasons.  I used to have many problems with my knees and was not much for running more then a mile.  I have found the exercise and examples given in this book to be outstanding.  They were exampled clearly and the author also backs the reasoning up with information that makes sense.  This book has opened my eyes to comfortable running which I did not know that was possible.  Thank you to the author and would highly recommend this book.
0385512104|4.0|This was a fun (unusual, but fun,) fast read, at least in my opinion. The story zips along quickly and the main character's unusual point of view kept things fresh and interesting for me. <br /> <br />One thing I will say - I thought that Christopher's viewpoint was quite interesting, and a nice interpretation of what MIGHT go on in the mind of an autistic teen. I've heard a lot about this book being a window into the autistic mind, though, when in the end it is still a fictional account. If what you're looking for is insight into the autistic mind then I would recommend reading something by Temple Grandin, Tito Mukhopadhyay, Sean Barron, or Donna Williams, who are autistic themselves and can give a more definite opinion about their own inner lives. If you're looking for a great read, though, I would recommend this book!
B00003CXCT|2.0|This space is for viewer-written reviews of a DVD set, not a message board for Star Wars geeks to engage in flame wars. I can't believe Amazon is letting this go on. <br />  <br />My review: <br />As I have not seen these films as they are to be released, I can't comment on the quality.   <br /> <br />As someone who saw the original films, I give two stars to this version of the trilogy.  The original films had great special effects for their time, a fast pace, and engaging characters.  They also had some several very bad actors in key roles, mediocre dialogue, and numerous continuity errors, both within the  individual films and over the course of the series. I personally found them a bit boring, but would recommend them for fans of space fantasy. The movies as originally released deserve 3 stars, but I took one away due to the director's revisionism.
B0000DJZA5|4.0|My peers today would probably laugh at me when they hear that my favorite band is The Beatles. Teens today may consider it \\"outdated\\" but I always insist it the most famous and successful rock group ever.  <br /> <br />The Beatles released their first album Love Me Do in 1962 and soon become famous throughout the world. They were a strong positive force in a time of great social and political disenchantment, which represented the optimism and spread the social consciousness. They were as voice for the young people of the time. The Beatles was dismissed eight years later, in 1970.  If the first album marked a start of a music era, the separation signaled the end of the era.  <br /> <br />Among all the albums, Let It Be is my favorite.  It is said that this album was released in memory of Paul or John's mother and aunt but I would rather consider it as a comfort to their dismissal in 1970. No matter what kind of misunderstandings there existed, they were good brothers for years. It was natural to feel sad when they dismissed the band. This is a pain that could not be expressed by words, so they let out the emotion through the song. <br /> <br />The intermezzo played by George led the music to the crescendo. Followed were Ringo's Drumstick and John's soft vocal accompaniment. This paragraph makes me think of the song Yesterday and Tears in heaven, which give me the same feeling, touching the chords of my heart softly. Perhaps this is what every fan feels-we can always find our own in the songs. <br /> <br />I love Let It Be. <br />At starry nights, it makes me feel flushed; <br />In despair, it gives me comfort and hope;  <br />In predicament,   it reminds me of \\" let it be\\" and a placid attitude; <br />In darkness, it lights the road in front of me. <br /> <br />
B000002J0B|5.0|This is, hands down, my favorite Led Zeppelin album. Physical Grafitti comes in at second but I feel that no other Zep album can touch this one. I am a guitarist and know how to play all of the songs on this album, save for \\"The Crunge\\", and can appreciate it from a listener's point of view and a musician's. The music is extremely technical and complex (not to mention most of the songs are reasonably difficult). While I'm on the subject, Jimmy Page is the reason I play guitar. Led Zeppelin is a band that never ceases to amaze me; each member of the band is, by themselves, an amazing musican. The caliber of talent in each individual member of this band, not to mention as a whole, can be overwhelming. This is a great place to start listening to Led Zeppelin. This album is both accessable and prolific. If you listen to this album and don't think it's a masterpiece, you probably don't have a soul and are filled with impenetrable evil. And if you are not a Zep fan after you hear this, the former statement applies as well.
B0002I831S|1.0|Beware, Paramount has made some coding blunders - at least on the set I received - which caused disk three of the set to be unusable. The same problems happened on every DVD player I tried with this disk. Basically menus would not function which meant you could not play the disk (!). The behavior seems more symptomatic of flawed coding than a production problem with my sample. They may need to get a revised disk out.
0446677450|5.0|I gave two books to my 25-year old son because I was worried that he wasn't doing anything with his life. The first book, Optimal Thinking: How To Be Your Best Self motivated him to stop settling for second best and showed him how to make the most of any situation. This book showed him how to think about money in an era where a college education is not enough. My son has stopped hanging around and is making the most of himself.  I recommend each of these books to adopt the right mindset for optimal personal and financial wealth.
B00005JNEI|5.0|For me, what I saw in this movie was not too shocking nor anything new because if you live OUTSIDE of the USA, most of what appeared in Fahrenheit 9/11 was standard news Coverage.  It's fascinating that people say this is one sided - biased, tainted journalism when I see a 10 day old footage being shown on CNN as Live. ( I saw the footage overseas ) and recongnized it immediately but was surprised as the anchors commentated on the \\"breaking news.\\"  But can't Americans see why Their News Agencies never show the footage that's in the Movie?? Look at the reaction - people get upset and don't want to watch it!  What News agency would risk losing it's audience by telling the truth?  And when you lose your audience, you lose your sponsors. Money, money, money.  Sound kinda familiar?  every country does some dirty things, to believe yours is a perfect angel is just plain ignorant.
B0002858YS|4.0|At times both homage to the 80s and wholly appropriate to 2004, \\"Hot Fuss\\" is a sparkling debut CD from The Killers.  As with most debuts, the CD is inconsistent.  Assuredly, there are not 11 great tracks on this work; however, there are *GREAT* works, and they constitute a high enough percentage to warrant an unequivocable \\"BUY\\". <br /> <br />To wit, the highlights, as I see them, are: <br />* Mr. Brightside <br />* Somebody Told Me <br />* All These Things That I've Done <br />* On Top
B00009V8Z9|5.0|Gavin DeGraw is a rare find in the music industry today. He is a breath of fresh air compared to the other \\"artists\\" that rule the airwaves. Chariot is an excellent CD with songs that you can never get tired of. Even the subjects range, from light-hearted songs like \\"Chemical Party\\" to songs like \\"I Don't Want To Be.\\" He also writes & plays his own music. He is a talent that half the arts, even a third of the artists, can not compare to. What's popular in todays culture is teeny-boppers like Hilary Duff with voices who are enhanced  for their CDs. But Gavin DeGraw dares to be himself, even if it doesn't jump him to super-stardom. And that's what makes him, and his music, so special.
B00006RU5B|5.0|Honestly this is the best piece of music I have ever heard.  I can't name a single bad thing about this album.  This is an album that every fan of rock/alternative should own.  The bassist, Tim Commerford, makes every song have a great tune which flows with Chris Cornell's voice.  Every song on this album is a highlight but I guess there are a few that stick out from the rest.  Those songs include: Bring 'Em back Alive, Light my Way, Set It Off, What You Are, Cochise, Hypnotise and..well lets just say all the songs on the album are my favourites.  The last thing I'd have to say is simply... BUY THIS CD.
B000022TSW|4.0|I seldom watch South Park on Comedy Central, though numerous friends of mine say that it's 100% American hysteria. So, when this film came out in theaters in '99, I decided to see what all this was about, and boy am I glad I did! <br /> <br />\\"South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut\\" has to be the most die-hard hilarious mature (NOT for the kiddies, sorry) animated feature since Rover Dangerfeild. The theme is generally unimportant, but basically is a parody on itself and other Comedy Central cartoons. Who knew songs like \\"Kyle's Mom is a B*****,\\" Shut Your F***in' Face, Uncle F***er,\\" and \\"It's Easy Mmm-kay,\\"--would be so hard to stop laughing at. <br /> <br />The opening musical number, \\"Little Mountain Town,\\" would make Walt Disney roll over in his grave, as is pokes fun at \\"This Poor, Provincial Town\\" in 'Beauty and the Beast.' <br />As a matter of fact, the entire movie is an enormous musical parody, while still pulling out it's own ludicrious plot. <br />Even George Clooney gets in on the act, as he portrays himself as an ER surgeon who mistakenly replaces Kenny's heart with a baked potato. <br /> <br />The Terrance and Phillip film 'Asses on Fire,' in which the entire plot revolves around, is one of the highest points of laughter, which includes fart gags and name-calling that even most teens wouldn't stoop to, turned into a musical number in the streets. <br /> <br />So it isn't a \\"family film!\\" Who care's?! It was intended for an adult aduience, people--GET A CLUE!  <br />So go rent this, and be sure to use the potty first, Mmm-kay? <br /> <br />Saw it, died laughing, bought it, <br />--GIGI
B000002WYT|4.0|I feel that the album crash is one of his best albums.  It has the songs crash, drive in drive out, and i believe stay.  These songs are one of my favorite.  They have such a great sound to them and the lyrics are so appealing.  When ever i am sort of down or in a bad mood, all I have to do is put in a Dave Matthews Band cd and i am good to go.  It does not matter which one, they are all amazing.  If you have never heard a Dave cd then you are definately missing out.
B00006V9A0|2.0|On Yahoo I've read that the boxset is due in November too, supposedly with \\"50 unreleased Cobain demos and unreleased songs\\" plus a DVD, but I'm very skeptical about that. First off, I've heard every year, for the past eight years, that around holiday season that there would be a boxset, and I've been let down each and every time. And second, a whopping fifty previously-unreleased songs PLUS a DVD disc sounds very fishy. Massive legal woes like the ones we've seen over the rights for Cobain's music cannot be cleared up as suddenly as they've seen to have been. And all of us realistic people out there know that if it sounds too good to be true, then it is. I won't believe the news until I actually see the boxset for sale in the record shop. I know people here love to bash Courtney Love, but she's just being used as a scapegoat for everything that goes wrong in the legal realm of Nirvana's music. Cobain's former bandmates are just as ripe for the ripping, if not more. The only reason David Grohl, and ESPECIALLY Krist Novoselic said they're all for the release of Kurt's unheard songs is for the money. Remember, kids, never trust a politician, especially one such as good 'ol Novie who's been the biggest pothead drunk since I don't know who. The motives of a musician-cum-politician who aligns his music and own celebrity with the sleazy, dishonest world of politics should be questioned. JAMPAC my arse.
B0000027F8|5.0|This is one of the saddest, most depressing cds you'll ever listen to. There's definitely a haunting undertone here, but the songs are very good and they showcase Michael's tremendous singing ability. If you are looking for happy music, keep right on going, because this isn't for you. If you like a little piano, acoustic guitar, and a wide variety of song styles, then you should like this. It's George Michael in a way he was never seen before. I've always enjoyed this cd more than his candy-pop music, and I'll never part with it.
B0000025RI|5.0|I agree his personal life is not normal and IF he did what he did to children..he should go to jail.But no on one knows what is true or not yet.  <br />But if tou love something thats different,has imagination,meaning,and the best song writing and production then thriller has all. <br />i was not a mj fan at first but as times went on and i saw him do his moonwalk and robotic moves plus everytime i go to a club your sure to hear one mj track. Then i knew peoplr like him are rare and his type of talent will never be seen in music again. <br />you will never see an album like thriller again.Its a peace of history.7 number one out of 10 and 45 million copys worldwide.the imagination from the thriller track and video is top.. top class thinking.This is the best album in music history and for that his music should not be jugded on his personal life.
B0001Z52RU|1.0|A large group of us watched this together, and were all simply appalled by it. We watched the director's cut first, and then went back and watched the theatrical ending (which was better, for the first time in my personal experience). This movie was so bad it has created a new catch phrase amongst my group of friends. We measure how awful something is by how badly it made us want to go back in time and hang ourselves with our own umbilical cord (if you've watched the director's cut, you'll know why we say this . . .). Do yourself a huge favor and use the 2 hours you'd otherwise waste on this film doing something useful, like taking a nap.
B0000CAXIC|5.0|Dave Grohl is a god.  This is the best cd in the world.  because it has a compilation of hard rock, rock, and even mellow rock songs.  The songs are all catchy.  All of the songs are gold.  There are no bad songs on this cd.  Everlong is the best song on the CD, closely followed by Monkey Wrench and My Hero.  3rd is Hey Johnny Park!. <br /> <br />Rock out with a glock out <br />
B0000AQS0F|4.0|This series got off on the wrong foot when the pilot wasn't aired. I had trouble figuring out what was going on when it was on the air. Thank God the whole pilot is on the DVD set. It's a great show, that had serious promise. Too bad the network shafted it from the start, then didn't give it time to find it's audience. If you're a Buffy/Angel fan, give this one a chance.
B00004RJEG|5.0|I have never reviewed anything on Amazon, but after listening and seeing this DVD I had to change that.  This is undoubtedly the BEST DVD I have ever seen and heard!  I waited years for this DVD to come out with Region 1 encoding, and it was worth the wait.  This is The Corrs at their best.  Clear, crisp vocals with just enough instrumentation.  The \\"No Frontiers\\" duet with Sharon and Caroline is wonderful!  I knew they both could sing, but not this well.  Andrea is incredible as always.  She has to be one of the most beautiful women in the world.  It's easy to tell the group enjoyed making this video.  The cozy setting with the partial orchestra was a wonderful idea.  I haven't figured out how the audience stayed in their seats the whole time.  The instrumentals make you want to jump up and dance.  This is a MUST HAVE DVD for any Corrs fan!  I only wish I could have given it more than 5 stars!
B00008EY65|3.0|NOTHING SPECIAL-A TRIFLE ENTERTAINING really says it all.<br /><br />-watchable, yet there was something better you could have watched.<br /><br />Not upset you watched it-but you should have finished that book you were reading.
6304806426|5.0|This magnificent film captures the essence of what is an equally wonderful book -- both are beautifully described, full of interesting historical content, and emotionally just devastating.  What the film added was gorgeous art direction and cinematography, and the physical intensity of Ralph Fiennes -- I thought he was perfection in this role, with the rest of the cast being outstanding as well.  Watch for the lovely transition where the aerial topography fades to a close-up of rumpled sheets with the same geographic contours, and so many other breathtaking scenes.  I haven't been this absorbed and bowled over by a film for a long time.
B00005JMAH|5.0|Well, as you can tell this review is for my friend Elizabeth. See is in love with this movie and Daniel Radcliff. She saw the movie a couple times in the theater and she is haveing complutions waiting for the DVD to be released. She will have a party with her firends the Balkins and watch it many a time. She is so obsessed that she had a pudding birthday party for Daniel Radcliff for his birthday...sadly I did not attend I probably missed one of the defining moments of my life. well I can alredy see a 0 to 100 on the helpful votes at the top but this was a joke between me and Elizabeth and the rest of the world reading this will not understand...yep I can see you scratching you head with a perplexed look at this very moment reading this so I will stop confusing you even more and stop writing...well not quite yet I also want to say that this is a great movie and all you potter heads don't know what a good movie is because you read too much. With that said I bid you good day.
B00004XONN|3.0|I think very few have hit the target with Kid A. As far as sound and structure goes, Radiohead's follow-up to the landmark OK Computer basically draws from Post-Rock influences, a valiant attempt to bring this genre to the surface. Other than 'The National Anthem' (which closely resembles Primal Scream's 'Shoot Speed Kill Light') I was immediately struck by 2 distinctive Post-Rock features, (a) the techno Aphex Twin/Mouse On Mars type of arrangement and sounds, and (b) a Gastr Del Sol/Jim O'Rourke approach to structure and subtle use of noise. I can really hear the Gastr Del Sol influence all throughout the album. Kid A might sound very alien and experimental to many, but Radiohead may have been aiming for Post-Rock's Sgt Pepper, and in retrospect might have succeeded.
B000002UA7|5.0|I had not listened to Kate Bush since I was a 4 yr old boy watching an aussie music program called \\"CountDown\\" hosted by Molly Meldrum (for the non aussies who may know of him).... <br /> <br />Having picked this up second had for $6 (Aus) I found it to an amazing journey with \\"Wuthering Heights\\" and \\"Babooshka\\" and my favourite track \\"Running Up That Hill\\"....  <br /> <br />I recommened this cd to anyone who is unfamiliar or wanting to get a quick overview of Kat Bushes music journey....
1400032717|5.0|For those who know someone who suffers from autism, this book is a unique and compassionate look at life through the lense of autism. The things we take for granted are sometimes the most difficult obstacles for autistic people, especially children. But this story sheds light on the fact that despite the hardships, life pushes on, and nothing is impossible.
B00004YRQA|3.0|What I said about the PS1 memory card can be said about the PS2 memory card as well. Memory cards are evil. If Sony was wise they would do what Microsoft did with the X-Box and include a memory system as part of the system instead of having the consumer spend more money on an item that should be part of the system to begin with. But unfortunately, if you want to save any progress on any games you play, you have to have one. Also, unlike PS1 cards, the Sony PS2 card is the best memory card out there for the PS2 system so instead of saving a few bucks and getting a cheaper memory card, it's usually better to just buy the Sony version instead and save yourself some time, money, and trouble. PS2 memory cards won't save info from PS1 games, so you have to buy cards for both systems in order to play all games. An expensive extra necessity if you own a PS2.
B0002WYS6S|5.0|This is the DVD that all Dream Theater fans are gonna want. It will contain songs from \\"Images and Words\\" all the way to the new \\"Train of Thought\\" CD. Sure the 2001 DVD was good and all, but this one won't have any annoying video clips or graphics shown instead of the four greatest rock musicians alive today. I heard this show was great and Labrie was in top form along with the entire band. The 2nd disc is going to be jammed with behind the scenes extras to go along with the entire uncut 170 minute concert on the first disc. October 5th is looming closer and I will be first in line!
B000002NCW|3.0|If you like Mike Oldfield's Celtic influences, this is the album for you. It sounds like a new age soundtrack for every Hollywood depiction of Dear Old Ireland you've ever seen, sure and begorrah, shillelagh, aren't me mammy's eyes green, kiss the Blarney Stone, and that'll be eighteen dollars and change thank you very much.<br /><br />The final long track, \\"Mont St Michel\\", brings in an orchestra and dilutes the taste of shamrocks to a more subtle and palatable level, but sounds suspiciously like an audition for soundtrack work. It's good, but not \\"must buy the CD\\" good.<br /><br />Think of this album as Clannad or Enya with more musical inventiveness.  For those who like that sort of thing, this is the sort of thing you like, and a great example thereof. But for Oldfield fans like me who &lt;em>don't&lt;/em> really like that kind of thing, stay well away.
B00028HBKC|5.0|This movie is not antisementic in any way. That is pretty much exactly the way the bible tells us it happens. YES the rabbis DID for the most part convince the crowd to crucify Jesus, but Jesus was a Jew as well. JUst because its christian doesnt mean its antisementic you liberals and the gore should stay too. Thats what our lord suffered for us. This movie was made because of all the crap that is being made now. The media needs a little good side. Is that to much to ask. This coming from a kid whose only fifteen.
B000096H33|2.0|I've got nothing against remasterings, or even re-recordings. The re-recording of Philip Glass's \\"Einstein On The Beach\\", for example, is far more powerful than the original. If only the same were true of Tubular Bells.<br /><br />It's a common truism amongst artists that if you work and re-work a piece of art too much, you work all the life and spontaneity out of it. That seems to have happaned here. Yes, the recordings of the instruments are all cleaner and sharper, but there's a processed homogeneity to the whole thing, with every sequenced beat being just a little too perfect, every guitar note just a bit too smooth and consistent.<br /><br />There are some specific flaws too. Piltdown man with vocoders? Please. The original was murky, primitive and threatening; this new version is just silly. Similarly, John Cleese should have been discouraged from camping it up, rather than having \\"Mandolin!\\" sampled like a Max Headroom quip. It's symptomatic of the fact that where the original was earnest and a touch angry in places, this new version sounds jokey and artificial. Maybe the Mike Oldfield of 2003 views it as a joke album, or perhaps it's all about the money.<br /><br />As a final note, I still think the original intended ending of \\"Tubular Bells\\" is far better than the cheesy synth Sailor's Hornpipe used on the first release, and inexplicably kept for this re-recording. You'll only hear the real ending on the version of TB included in \\"Boxed\\". Personally, I edited the \\"Boxed\\" ending onto the 1990s remastered edition of the original \\"Tubular Bells\\" using Cubase, and that's my ultimate version. I'm literally throwing the 2003 release away and pretending I never heard it.
B0002IQHY8|5.0|Alan has created another masterpiece. The first track is absolutely astonishing and Dave Gilmour's guitar solo rips with the same fire of any of the best old Pink Floyd stuff. Gilmour still has it. Also the track We Play The Game is absolutely incredible. The whole CD holds my interest from beginning to end. Nice work Alan!
B00005JN2X|5.0|I was wondering if they'd be able to pull off the cab ride of destruction as a credible thriller.  They sure did!  The acting was  top notch, with Tom as villian and Jamie Foxx at his best ever!  The quick pace and building tension kept me on the edge of my seat. A great summer movie!
0780631684|4.0|I'm about to get on a plane in about 2 weeks, for the second time only in my whole life, and boy, I shouldn't have watched this movie! The other night I was bored, and decided to compare my list of DVDs to my list of DVDs I've reviewed, and discovered there's about 50 that I have not reviewed! So to get the ball rolling, I thought I'd review the first ever DVD I ever got! (It was also the first commentary I ever watched, and apart from Miss Congeniality, I'll never watch one again!)<br /><br />I'd originally seen this at the cinema, and started to get into the whole DVD phenomenon, albeit a couple of years behind everyone else. 221 DVDs later - I don't smoke, rarely drink, or do drugs, so this is my vice, and a constant source of amusement among the people I work with! I also get very much teased about liking this movie when I started college.<br /><br />This movie still scares me four years on, even though I've seen it a million and one times. I get quite jumpy, and the thought of getting on a plane after seeing this sickens me (even if it is an hour long, internal flight). The extras also freak me out, especially the quiz, which tells you the exact date you're going to die. I can't remember the exact date now, but it was quite far away. It freaked me out so much the first time I did it, I've never dared do it again, to find out if the date changes. Apart from the usual generic garbage, that's the only extra I've ever truly hated on a DVD.<br /><br />There are quite a few great actors in this, although apart from the lovely Ali Larter, they haven't done too much else in movies, or set the box offices alight. I've seen a picture of Devon Sawa from his latest movie, and he's fairly lost his OK looks from this and starring in Eminem's \\"Stan\\". Apart from Dawson's Creek, the gorgeous (his cheekbones, his eyes, nice) Kerr Smith's only reasonable 'hit' has been Cruel Intentions 3, a straight to DVD sequel sequel!!! (Which I will probably get now I know he is in it) Tony Todd is also the evil mortician guy, who was originally in Candyman. Seann William Scott also appears in a small and insignificant role and he later ends up getting brutally decapitated.<br /><br />The only good thing about the commentary was that the amount of stuff the director points out, cool little facts & stuff. The whole 9:25 stuff is absolutely wicked, and I love how they managed to incorporate it all. The woman at the check-in desk at the airport tells Alex that the plane leaves at 9:25, which is the same as his birthday (25th September). When he gets on the plane he sits in seat I (which is the 9th letter of the alphabet) and the seat is in row 25. In scenes not shown in the final cut of the movie, but in the deleted scenes Alex and Clear's baby is born at 9.25. (Which can get confusing, as Alex & Clear's relationship suddenly turns from friendly, to a more intimate relationship, without explaining why, unless you watch the deleted scenes.) There's also a luggage cart, which has 666 written on the top of it and during the very dull opening credits, all of the deaths in the movie are foreshadowed. There is a hanging doll, a guillotine, and a picture of a knife in someone's chest. Continuously throughout, music by John Denver is played, who I'd never heard of until I 'watched' the commentary, and found out about him.<br /><br />I've never understood why some people don't like this movie, but prefer the second one. It's always strange when people do that. I found the second one good, but sometimes (like now, for instance), I find I can't remember a single stand out thing about it.<br /><br />This is a great movie, and it's terrific to see a teen slasher flick with a different concept for once. Sure, they all die in same ways to other teen slasher flicks: flying heads, a girl being totally crushed by a giant bus (you NEED to watch that scene frame by frame, cos it's fantastic), a woman getting caught by 'accident' inside a house on fire and much more. Just don't attempt to do the quiz OK?re. Just don't attempt to do the quiz OK?
0553571338|5.0|\\"The Giver\\" is captivating, thought-provoking, and beautifully written. It deals with: Sameness vs. Diversity. It challenges the reader to ask \\"how much freedom am I willing to give up for security?\\"--A relevant question in today's climate (2004).  This Newberry Medal winner is best for young adults, but mature adults would greatly enjoy this book as well.

0380778556|5.0|It's true that most people will find the first two chapters (or more) tedious, but don't let that stop you from reading the rest. The nameless narrator (a brilliant move-- although I read that Du Maurier simply couldn't think of a name) has the truest emotions of any character in any book I've read, and I don't see how anyone can dispute it.  Be careful reading other reviews on this site-- many are great, but several give inaccurate details that may send you into it with the wrong state of mind (and some even give away the plot!). Read it and enjoy. The book does move well-- but pay attention! Little details may very well be important...they help to make this book the masterpiece it is.
0316666343|4.0|Life doesn't always seem fair especially when it's taken away from you.   <br />This story is deeply moving.  From the perspective of a young girl watching down on earth, she lets us explore her pain, her love and the world that she can't be apart of yet can't leave behind.
B00005JNEI|5.0|Economics runs politics and heres the proof. Some politicians are using their position to make a lot of money. We have to face this painful fact. The only positive solution is to read and vote without letting the apathy, that self serving politicans engender in us, run us down. Depression and apathy wont change the society and it just feeds the pharmaceutical industry. <br /> <br />Today greed and consumerism seem to run our lives and i feel we need to find morals, find personal strength and take part in political discussion more than ever. It seems its become bad to talk about politics. Its seen as heavy or depressing or serious. But we need serious rather than seeking fun all the time. <br /> <br />Bush is just one man, dictators have always been here and they always will be. But now the techniques to control people are very advanced and based around manufactured fears and substitution games (eg you need to buy this to take away your loneliness or make your life so much better). <br /> <br />Hopefully films like this will help us all speak up with more knowledge and confidence. Lets try to stop hiding from our fears. Modern politicians use fear and your home and goods to keep you quiet and powering the system till you die.  <br /> <br />Apathy, manufactured fear and ignorance = the governments we've got. <br /> <br />Come on or we're dooommed.. <br />
B00028HBKM|3.0|Due to a commitment my family has made not to view \\"R\\" rated movies, my husband and I decided to see this movie \\"edited\\".  I must say that the impact that this movie apparently had on people must have been attributed mainly to the violence, because having much of that edited out, the movie was left wanting in my eye's.  I don't WANT to see graphic violence however (even though graphic it may have been in real life) and I wish more had been shown about his life and teachings.  My absolute favorite part of the movie was when Jesus was building his table and chairs, along with all other flashbacks.  I didn't decide to see this movie to be \\"enlightened\\" but rather out of curiousity.  Anyone who has a sound understanding of the biblical accounts of Christ's life will not learn anything new from this movie.  I realize however, that many whose relationship with Christ is weak will probably be impacted by seeing what he went through for us in movie form.  My view is that much more can be learned through studying the bible itself and through prayer.  An even greater understanding of our Savior's life and mission can be obtained through more intimate channels, prayer, meditaion, revelation.  I give credit to Mel Gibson though, and believe that his intentions were sincere, not selfish.  This movie is not anti-semetic.  To say so is to show that one's understanding of the scriptures is lacking.  Christ was a Jew, so were many of those who followed him, so were many of those who brought about his death.  A reminder though, He gave up his life.  No one took it from him.  If your curious about the politics and people that participated in the Lord's death, I suggest a marvelous documentary novel called Pontius Pilate, by Paul Maier.  Also, for those who seek a more spiritually uplifting movie about Christ, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints has put out a film called \\"Finding Faith in Christ\\".  It is not quite hollywood material of course, but comes close and is very well made for a religious film.  It is biblical in content as well.  You can get a FREE copy of the film by calling 1-800-443-9911 or on the website [...]  Seriously, it's absolutely FREE! I've enjoyed it in my dvd library.
B00003CXAA|5.0|The 1970's are regarded by many as one of the greatest decade for movies.  it was a decade that saw Spielberg, Lucas, Scorcese, Polanski, Altman make their marks while titans like Kurosawa and Bergman were still producing breathtaking work.  Thus it is no faint praise to say that the greatest impact was from an Italian-American genius named Francis Ford Coppola, who produced two stunning motion pictures -- Godfather I and II. <br /> <br />You know the story.  I won't bore you with regugitating the plot.  But if, like me, you haven't seen it in a while, you may have forgotten just how amazing these pictures are.  The cinematography, taking advantage of a technique no longer in use, is beautiful.  The cast reads like a Hollywood walk of fame and (for once) delivers like one.  And Coppola's direction is excellent both in character moments and in action scenes.  The movie take their time and revel in small details.  But that's how the weave a spell that draws the viewer in. <br /> <br />Godfather III, while not up to the par of the first two, is still a fine motion picture.  The ire it has drawn is inevitable, given the 16-year wait.  A similar fate awaited Star Wars I after such a long delay.  And perhaps the ire is stirred by there being a great movie trapped in a merely good movie's body.  A little editing and a few more scenes to flesh out the plot made have made it a classic.  But it is what it is -- a good movie that lets us visit the world that fascinated us from the first two movies -- and even leaves us hungry for more (I would have loved to have seen a Godfather IV and/or more of Andy Garcia). <br /> <br />Fortunately, Paramount has given the Godfather saga the treatment it deserves.  The movies sprawl over four DVD's, providing amazing sound and bringing out the movies' lush color palette beautifully.  Coppola has provided a commentary track that is hardly classic, but entertaining and insightful.  You realize how much he enjoyed making them, even as Paramount was trying to wrench control away.  The extras on DVD 5 are excellent, featuring deleted scenes, copious documentaries and footage of oscar speeches that are worth watching just see the horrifying suits worn to the 1972 oscars. <br /> <br />I bought this mainly from a sense of obligation as a movie buff.  But after watching the Godfather saga for the first time in years, I was reminded of just why these are considered such classics.  Yeah, the price is a little steep, but it's worth it to see two of the true classic of modern cinema.
B000286RKW|5.0|\\"Funny?  Funny like how?  Like I'm a clown?  Like I'm hear to amuse you?\\"  The best scene in almost any movie,  maybe having Joe Pesci saying it makes it that much better. <br /> <br />Goodfellas, as many would say, the best mob movie around.  I will have to agree, that is a damn fine movie. <br /> <br />The story of a guy growing up in a town where the mob are the cool cats in town.  Everyone shows them respect ('cause they're scared probably), people know not to mess with them.  An easy income at that, too.  Well, almost easy. <br /> <br />This guy, played by Ray Liotta, comes up through the ranks to make it big.  Early on he gets arrested, but the smart kid that he is, he doesn't rat out his friends.  When he's released, he gets back into that world, some showing him respect for showing his true colors at his trial (not rating the families out).  It is here that we meet Joe Pesci's character Tommy.   <br /> <br />One of my favorite characters from the Sopranos (Michael Imperioli who plays Christopher in that show) plays a famous role in Goodfellas.  That of a guy who Pesci picks on, a fool in his opinion.   <br /> <br />The movie takes a turn for the worse about halfway through.  As cocaine becomes a major issue in the film.  Ray Liotta's character becomes addicted, as well as his wife (played by Lorraine Bracco, also of Sopranos fame) and his mistress.  Things start going downhill for the others in the film at this point too, the first half of the movie is the best. <br /> <br />A film that will always be a classic in many people's minds.  Directed by Martin Scorsese, who put Joe Pesci in his 1995 film (Casino) in a simular role to this one. DeNiro has been in many of Scorsese's pictures too:  Mean Streets, Goodfellas, Cape Fear, and Casino to name a few.
B00003CXCT|1.0|After reading about the 'enhancements', I canceled my order.  I have no interest in seeing this version.
B0002DRDBE|4.0|Kevin Smith's first film Clerks.  The first time we'd see the mildly-entertaining Jay and Silent Bob.   <br /> <br />This show had some good lines in it, but all in all, it wasn't that good.  The guy who ran the video store was okay I thought, until I saw his same character in \\"Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back\\" - then I realized how much of a dork he was.  As for the guy who ran the Quick-Stop Store - I've never been one to watch shows about pathetic people.  I love to make fun of them in real life, so why would I want to watch them in movies?   <br /> <br />The scene where the customer is asking the video-store guy about some movies she wants to rent, and the guy isn't paying attention is classic.  I've ripped off the \\"You gotta tear into the occasional customer\\" line so many times to my fellow co-workers, so I have Clerks to thank for that.   <br /> <br />As far as the store workers' love spats go, it's just boring.  I mean maybe it was meant to shock the first-time viewer, but it just makes the movie that much more boring when you watch again and again.   <br /> <br />As far as the extras on this DVD goes, there are three discs for this release.  I read from a source that they spent $200,000 on one of the documentaries on this set called 'Snowball Effect' (which is reference to a gross-situation in the film, which I've heard about in real life).  Some may say:  \\"Wow, $200,000, but they only spent $28,000 to make the film!\\" <br /> <br />
B000000WFF|5.0|The spice girls (quite possibly one of the biggest groups of all time) are really underrated on how much impact they did in the late 90s... they were huge!  when i bought SPICE (their first successful LP) I did not think they could top it.... i thought wrong, this LP is their best piece of work...  <br /> <br />I thought they had great voices and the choice of songs they did on this LP were brilliant...  <br /> <br />Argubably the best track on the LP is &#34;Too Much&#34;, the hard hitting ballad that showcase the girls as great singers... the strings, the arrangement, everything.. even ginger spice sounded good... Sporty Spice (the odvious lead singer of the spice girls) takes the girls and the listeners to the journey of 4 min of sweet harmonies... <br /> <br />The second song that is up there with &#34;too much&#34; is the rock inspired PEPSI song &#34;move over&#34;... this song gets to the point and fast: energizing and fun.   <br /> <br />Songs like &#34;denying&#34;, &#34;viva forever&#34;, and &#34;stop&#34; are planted in listeners minds after one listen... <br /> <br />U just cannot get enough of these girls.... until GINGER SNAPS&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62; LMMFAO!!!!!  but if the girls were still together they would have had maybe a year more or two... <br /> <br />this LP is their best and it is worth every penny... if u loved the spice girls at one point in life.... <br /> <br /> <br />
B00008RH3L|5.0|It's odd that this is my favorite movie, since I've seen several other films from the Coen Brothers, including \\"Fargo\\" and \\"O Brother Where Art Thou\\", and I just haven't cared for them.  They tend to make very quirky films, and \\"Miller's Crossing\\" certainly has some of that (just get a load of Steve Buscemi's character in this movie and you'll see what I mean), but it doesn't seem to descend into silliness the way some elements of other Coen films do.<br /><br />Another reviewer described \\"Miller's Crossing\\" as \\"the thinking man's mob movie\\", and I couldn't sum it up any better than that.  The first thing that will strike you when you see it is the beauty of the film.  The locations, costumes, props, etc. all evoke the prohibition era better than I've ever seen any other film do.  (Visually, \\"Road to Perdition\\" does this pretty well too, though otherwise it's not nearly in the same class with \\"Miller's Crossing\\".)  It draws you into the period and makes makes you want to live there.  Also helping this is the use of 1920s or 30s slang.  The dialog in this film is great, and contributes immensely to the illusion that are watching something that actually took place in the early 20th century.<br /><br />The casting is also absolutely brilliant.  It's one of the few films I can think of where you just can't imagine other actors playing any of the roles.  Gabriel Byrne is perfect as the laconic Tom Regan. Albert Finney exudes charisma as charming, roguish Irish gang boss.  J.E. Freeman is menacing as the Italian boss' right hand man.  Marcia Gay Harden is utterly believable as the tough, rather unscrupulous gangster's moll, and John Turturro plays her scheming brother with just the right combination of charming affability and swinish selfishness and ingratitude.<br /><br />But the real star of the movie is the plot.  It's just complex enough to require your complete attention in order to stay abreast of all its twists and turns, but it's not so complicated that you can't follow it.  There is action and violence, but what really drives the story are the schemes and machinations of the characters, especially Tom Regan.  Regan appears to be battered by fortune all through the movie, and lloks like he's in over his head.  But when you reach the end of the film, you discover that he has been playing everyone like violins.  You can see several times in the movie when fate throws him a curve, and he is surprised by something that wasn't in his calculations, but each time he recovers beautifully, changes his plans accordingly, and turns the new development to his advantage.  He's a character who would have prospered at the court of the Borgias, but you can also see that his ruthlessness, and his capacity to carry off the coldest, most machiavellian intrigues are not qualities he himself admires, and indeed he obviously doesn't like himself very much.  This coldheartedness, along with his lack of warmth and charm, might make him look pretty rotten, save for one realy admirable quality which I can't really name without spoiling the ending for those who haven't seen the film.  Once you do see it though, you'll know what I mean.<br /><br />Perhaps it was the fact that this movie is not really fast paced that caused it to fade a bit at the box office, especially as it faced competition from \\"Goodfellas\\", which is both faster paced and more intense.  But if you want a gangster movie that evokes nostalgia for THE \\"gangster era\\" in America, sterling performances from truly first rate actors, and a plot that really stimulates your intellect, you owe it to yourself to check this movie out.can't follow it.

B0002IQNAG|5.0|I was taken too a drive in at 12 years of age to see this by my <br />cool brother-in-law.  Me and my twin sister like too have had a <br />heart attack. When we got home I became a zombie walking up the <br />walk and she nearly crapped her pants.  Its been 25 years and I <br />love it just as much as ever.  What a great plot.  What a great <br />action movie. What an incredible sound track for most of the  <br />movie.  I'll admit I don't care for the hero's music as Ken <br />Foree decides to save himself however.  For those who don't care <br />for this movie, great.  I have only met one person over these <br />years who didn't like this movie.  He said it wasn't scary, just <br />gross.  I disagree but the gross is not sensless, it's very  <br />needed to portrait what the seemingly mindless,slow, non-threats <br />can do if they get a grip on you. This is the first SUPER SET <br />I have ever bought.  Incredible extras.  Worth even more than I <br />paid.  For all the critics of this movie,  remember that this <br />was filmed for around 1 and 1/2 million.  Unbelievable that the <br />modern movies for 200 million can be so bad.  A classic which <br />needs a GOOD sequel.  Day was not good enough to follow Dawn. <br />Good luck getting funding.  I think the remake was very good in <br />a different way but probably hurt the chances for a zombie  <br />comeback. Does anyone know what the remake has made in dollars <br />to this point? Good luck Romero.
B00005JKGO|5.0|LA DOLCE VITA is neither terrible nor overrated. There is something to be said for the pretty large number of film fans who love this one. It is an episodic film, but that is a feature of much of Fellini.  In several films, Fellini builds his meaning in this way: not so much with a single continuing plot, but with a series of smaller stories that add up to a total collection of ideas.   <br /> <br />Maybe the secret (if there is one) of LA DOLCE VITA's appeal is that it's so darned interesting all the time.  This especially applies to the plot concerning Steiner. Steiner is the key figure in the film, apart from Marcello himself, who is Fellini's and the viewer's counterpart. What Steiner represents to Marcello is of prime importance. The young reporter sees the older man as a perfected, idealized version of himself. He longs to emulate Steiner and is convinced this man knows how to live life fully. There is irony aplenty in the entire Steiner narrative. When Marcello brings his wife to the Steiner party, they meet a few interesting, but mostly insufferablty pretentious 'intellectual' types. (the famous Fellini 'careless' post-dubbing of dialogue in this scene particularly amusing: it seems to add to these characters' disconnection from a true self, as though they don't even realize what they are actually saying). Steiner himself associates with these people, yet does not truly seem to be one of them. He feels trapped by his own pretentious circle of intellectuals. When Marcello tell him how much he envies and admires him, Steiner replies: <br /> <br />\\"Don't be like me. Salvation doesn't lie within four walls. I'm too serious to be a dilettante and too much a dabbler to be a professional. Even the most miserable life is better than a sheltered existence in an organized society where everything is calculated and perfected.\\" <br /> <br />This gives Marcello much to contemplate for the rest of the film. And Steiner's subsequent suicide confirms the deep suspicion growing within the protagonist that all of existence, as he himself has known it thus far, is fundamentally absurd and meaningless. For this reason the film is existential in its outlook. Marcello is the modern, urban human, trapped in an absurd universe. But Fellini, seems not fully despairing in his outlook. Consider, for example, the significance of Marcello's interaction with the blonde girl in the cafe--she represents a simpler life away from the city and the over-complications of modern existence. Many viewers have missed the fact that it is this same girl who waves to Marcello on the beach in the film's final scene: she waves and is telling something he is never able to hear, so he waves once, and turns back to the empty, inebriated crowd as they speculate about the unknowability of nature, embodied by a monstrous, bloated fish. <br />LA DOLCE VITA is a great film for the way it pulls some viewers in and forces them to contemplate the actual content of what they are seeing. The film's main theme is one it shares with fims of Antonioni: modern man has become disconnected from the natural world and he suffers because of it. LA DOLCE VITA's visual style is poetic, some of its characters are more than compelling and hard to forget, and its musical score by Nino Rota is among the most memorable of all time.
B0002858YS|5.0|I believe that this album is an amazing album. It takes some time to get use to some of the songs but you'll get fond of it. what really got my attention to this band was Somebody Told Me and Mr. Brightside. This entire CD is an amazing CD. I love how the band sounds as a whole. The mix with guitars and the electric keyboard is amazing.
B0002J4X1Q|1.0|Great movie, great DVD. But be warned -- the copy I received from Amazon did not include the promised coupon.
0316666343|5.0|I am a 40-something year old woman, yet I easily related to 14-year old Susie in this novel. Maybe because I was around her age in 1973, the year this novel begins. It was a wonderful book. It is a light and easy read, but often a page-turner that you don't want to put down. The ending was a little too perfect, with everything wrapped up with a bow at the end, but it really could not have ended any other way. Even though it deals with death and dying, it is a happy, feel good book in all but the first few chapter (the ones that deal with her murder). I will enjoy handing it to my own daughter to read.
B00003BDXG|3.0|Natural Born Killers is an odd movie, yet still enjoyable, that is a condemnation of the American public and media.  Mickey and Mallory Knox both come from broken homes where they were abused either physically, sexually, or both.  The lovers go on a two-week long killing spree killing 53 people.  Before long, the two are finally caught and thrown in prison.  However, the madness does not end there as there spree continues.  Oliver Stone made this movie much like what an acid trip would be.  Lots of hazy images, hallucinations, and crazy messed-up stuff happening.  After a while, it just gets repetitive.  The movie does serve as a condemnation of the American public for our fascination with killers, and in general things that are sick and disturbed.  Stone makes that clear within the first half hour and then after that its just blood and gore.  With all that said, I'm recommending this movie because it is so weird and different, and though I cannot figure out why, I liked this movie.   <br /> <br />  Woody Harrelson and Juliette Lewis are very good together as pyschotic mass murderers, Mickey and Mallory Knox.  Harrelson and Lewis are very believable together as their characters fall farther and farther into madness.  Robert Downey Jr steals the show as Wayne Gale, a tv host of a show similar to America's Most Wanted who is only interested in ratings.  His personal revelation he makes towards the end of the movie is one of the high points.  Tom Sizemore plays Jack Scagnetti, a corrupt cop with a checkered past who is hunting down Mickey and Mallory.  Tommy Lee Jones is also excellent as Warden Dwight McClusky, the warden of the prison Mickey and Mallory are sent to.  The movie also stars Rodney Dangerfield, Russell Means, and Steven Wright.  The Special Edition DVD offers commentary by Oliver Stone, making of documentary, interviews with cast and crew, alternate endings, widescreen presentation, deleted scenes, and 3 minutes of newly restored footage.  For an uneven, yet enjoyable movie with a powerful message, check out Natural Born Killers!
B00005JMEW|5.0|I am not a huge Quentin Tarantino fan even though I do like \\"Pulp Fiction\\".  So, I was surprised that I loved this movie so much.  In my opinion, it is better than \\"Kill Bill:  Vol. 2\\" (the 2nd half of this two-part movie).  Kill Bill is ultra violent and is NOT for everybody and I strongly caution anybody that is easily upset or offended by violence to stay away from this movie.  The violence is actually so over the top that it's funny and is meant to be funny (dark comedy).  But if you have a wicked sense of humor and violence doesn't bother you that much, (especially if it's used in a humorous manner), than this is the movie for you.  There are so many quotable and memorable lines in this movie and here are a few of my favorites:    Memorable Quotes from Kill Bill: Vol. 1 (2003)    The Bride : \\"Those of you lucky enough to have your lives, take them with you. However, leave the limbs you've lost. They belong to me now.\\"    The Bride : \\"It was not my intention to do this in front of you. For that I'm sorry. But you can take my word for it, your mother had it comin'. When you grow up, if you still feel raw about it, I'll be waiting.\\"    O-Ren Ishii : \\"You didn't think it was gonna be that easy, did you?\\"  The Bride : \\"You know, for a second there, yeah, I kinda did.\\"  O-Ren Ishii : \\"Silly rabbit.\\"  The Bride : \\"Trix are for...\\"  O-Ren Ishii : \\"...kids.\\"    O-Ren Ishii : \\"Silly Caucasian girl likes to play with Samurai swords.\\"    Budd : \\"That woman deserves her revenge and we deserve to die.\\"    The Bride : [spanking a young member of the Crazy 88s with her sword] \\"This is what you get for (...) around with the Yakuzas.  Go Home To Your Mother!!!\\"    The Bride : \\"But I am gonna ask you questions. And every time you don't give me answers, I'm gonna cut something off. And I promise you, they will be things you will miss.\\"    Here is a summary of what this movie is about:    In this film, written and directed by Quentin Tarantino, an assassin called \\"The Bride\\" (Uma Thurman) is shot at her wedding by her employer, \\"Bill\\" (David Carradine), and other members of their assassin circle.  She survives, though a bullet in her brain keeps her in a coma for five years.  Setting out for some payback, the Bride hunts down the various assassins, saving Bill for last. This is the first half of a two-part movie.  You need to see \\"Kill Bill:  Vol. 2\\" for the conclusion.    I rate this movie:  A-
B0002F7I9Y|5.0|\\"Did Ray know he was going to die?\\"  The question was asked of this record's producer on our local Austin-based radio station.  No one knows, but this album was Mr. Charles' consuming passion for the last months of his life---and it shows.   <br /> <br />Charles' genius is showcased with some of music's greats here, old friends and new, in a combination that should have something for everyone---and some surprises as well.   <br /> <br />One of the most poignant pieces in this collection is Ray Charles with old friend Willie Nelson singing \\"It was a very good year.\\"  The part-performance, part-reminiscence brought me to tears the first time I heard it.  Forget it, Old Blue Eyes, this pair of Music's Elder Statesmen just stole one of your signature songs.   <br /> <br />Another favorite of mine, James Taylor, teams up with Ray on \\"Sweet Potato Pie\\" which was previously written and performed by JT on his \\"Never Die Young\\" album.  This sprightly rendition has the place hopping.   <br /> <br />Other old and new friends are:  Bonnie Raitt, Diana Krall, Gladys Knight, BB King.  Every musical genre from country to old pop standards is covered with intensity and some of the best charted arrangements I have heard in a long time.   <br /> <br />If there's a Music Heaven, Ray's up there smiling on this piece.
B000092Q4U|5.0|Lamb of God's second album. (2003)<br /><br />Lamb of God's second album, As The Palaces Burn, was named \\"Album Of The Year\\" by Revolver Magazine. I bought it expecting for it to live up to the hype. Well, it does. As The Palaces Burn is for anyone who enjoyed the band's first album, New American Gospel. Although not as heavy as its predecessor, it still is a heavy album. The album starts with \\"Ruin\\" which is a very good and heavy track. The title track is even better. The next song, Purified, isn't as heavy, but it still is heavy. It also rocks. The next song, \\"11th Hour\\", is my favorite song on the album. It's also the first song by LOG I heard. \\"For Your Malice\\" is also heavy, and it's also awesome. \\"Boot Scraper\\" is another very good song, as are \\"Devil in God's Country\\" and \\"In Defence of Our Good Name\\". The next song \\"Blood Junkie\\", has an awesome guitar intro. The onlt thing is that I can't really describe it. But I can tell you it rocks. The final song, \\"Vigil\\", also has an awesome guitar intro. But it's a rather quiet one. It starts out quiet for around 37 seconds, and gets heavy. A good way to end a good album.<br /><br />Bottom line: It's a very good album. Well, i'm done here. Good day, reader.
B00028HBKM|1.0|First off, yes I am a Christian.  I really found this whole movie to be a complete waste of my time.  It really demands a complete suspension of belief to think this movie is anything resembling historically accurate.  First off, no human body would live through the flogging they gave Jesus in this movie.  So you say \\"but he's Jesus\\", and I counter with: \\"He's human\\".  Hence, no human could've lived through that, let alone walk afterwards or carry a cross. <br /> <br />Next up, the Romans (specifically Pilate) would have had no compassion.  C'mon people, these were the same guys that brought us the Colliseum and opened it with 180 days of gladiator battles.  Yes, I believe entirely that Pilate forced the temple Jews specifically call out Christ to be crucified, but not in a sympathetic to Jesus standpoint.  It would have been more aligned with making them the perpetrators of the incident (remember, Pilate didn't want the Romans getting mixed up in any of the temple's affairs), so this is more of a sadistic CYA move on his part. <br /> <br />Lastly, what's with the geyser of blood and water pooring from the spear wound?  The bible says that blood and water were spilled, not a fountain of it - the amount shown coming out of him would've desecated a human. <br /> <br />Oh yes - that whole table/chairs incident?  What/Why?  A complete distraction.  Yes, he was a carpenter but why add that he's *inventing* the modern table/chair setup?  Complete lack of accuracy and a distraction. <br /> <br />Well, I've said my piece.  This is a complete waste of time.  If you enjoy the whole blood/gore thing you are better off with something like Resident Evil or any number of slasher movies.  If you are seeking spiritual guidance I'd suggest The Gospel According to St Matthew or King of Kings or The Greatest Story Ever Told.  All of those are better.  Yes, Christ suffered greatly and that was his gift of divine salvation for the rest of us, but you would never understand that from this movie.  If you want to see Roman brutality, watch Gladiator instead.
B000002OXU|5.0|Who's next defined the link to the sixties and seventies. From the introductory use of synthesizers to the lyrical use of subtexts that Townshend hadn't written since \\"I Can See For Miles\\" we see on Who's Next the greatest rock band ever in all its glory. <br />The album begins with the anthemic dazzle of \\"Baba O'Reilly\\" <br />where \\"the teenage wasteland\\" echoes the past of T.S. Eliot's <br />The Wasteland, where art had lost its meaning like post-Altamont <br />for rock. But,with the next track, \\"Bargain\\", Townshend jumped  <br />up as a hero out to save the world with his punching guitar riffs <br />and original synthesizer ending which would have a tremendous <br />influence on later bands like The Cars. In \\"Getting In Tune\\" and <br />\\"The Song Is Over\\" we see a contrast in subtexts. \\"Getting In Tune\\" announces that The Who will \\"tune in on you\\" for music that <br />will ceremonialize their 70's focus on rock; and in tune with the times. \\"The Song Is Over\\", conversely operates as a love song but is melancholy and once again laments the passing of the <br />60's : \\"she was the first song I ever sang\\" Townshend sings but <br />without bitterness; instead his purpose is to \\"let's get together before we get much older\\" as the lyrics from \\"Baba <br />O'Reilly\\" remind us. <br />\\"Going Mobile\\" shows the lawlessness of the 60's with its wild <br />synthesizer ride but it is really a 70's song with its yuppie <br />life-style where Townshend sings \\"make the toast and tea\\". There <br />is also a comparison here with \\"she brings me tea, says the babe's a-sleeping\\" on \\"Love Ain't For Keeping\\". These songs reveal the band's maturity and identity, rising from their youths <br />of being foul-mouthed angry yobs or punks, to a still battling <br />band but with more important ideals to win. <br />Perhaps \\"Behind Blue Eyes\\" is the ultimate identity crisis song <br />of a sensitive man trying to explain his feelings and winding up in a paranoid rage.This is understandable as Townshend broke down <br />when The Lifehouse project was brought down in clubs - hence the <br />universal struggle we all face going into adulthood. And the quiet mood and then eruption of this seismic band illustates this. It is interesting to note that the only reference to booze <br />or drugs is in John Entwistle's amusing drunken run in \\"My Wife\\", <br />whereas Tommy and Quadrophenia are chinned with them. <br />Finally, we get to the greatest rock'n'roll song of all time. From its warning of imminent punk, and on a broader scale terror, <br />( \\"we'll be fighting in the streets\\" ) \\"Won't Get Fooled Again\\" <br />is a prophecy for the 70's and a headstone for the 60's. Whereas <br />The Who in the 60's were outrageous with their anger and violence <br />\\"Won't Get Fooled Again\\" signifies their removal from teen angst <br />to responsible men and they couldn't go back to the old style that had fooled them and the Woodstock generation.\\" The beards <br />have all grown longer overnight\\" Daltrey sings, empowered by the <br />layers of rich synthesizer, Keith's galavanting drums, and John's <br />thumping bass.But, it is Pete, whose grinding guitar makes the song especially work, and he is \\"the new boss, same as the old boss\\". But with a different agenda for the baby-new 70's then. <br />I believe \\" Who's Next\\" is the Mount Everest of music.
B0002EXH5O|3.0|I loved this cd, but after seeing the \\"copy contolled\\" sticker on it, i refused to buy it. I rip all my cd's onto my comp and play them there. I will not contribute to record companies infringing on my copy rights. However this is one of my favorite metal albums of all time. I ended up  downloading it (for free) off the net. The remaster is excellent, but dave shouldnt have re done the vocals.
B0002IVN9W|5.0|Every now and then, a truly original, groundbreaking band surfaces amid all the bland pop and rock. Montreal's Arcade Fire is one such band. In their glorious full-length debut \\"Funeral,\\" Arcade Fire spins elaborate art-rock full of passion and atmosphere.<br /><br />Rather than trying to hook you the way most songs do, Arcade Fire builds up their songs to a musical (and emotional) crescendo. The album opens on a four-song cycle called \\"Neighborhood,\\" which deal with daydreams, neglect, fighting in a family, and just sitting around waiting for life to happen to you. All four things are pretty clearly considered disastrous -- don't waste time, make life happen!<br /><br />Certainly that get-off-your-bum-and-make-things-happen attitude carries over to the wild \\"Wake Up,\\" a howling anthem with an ever-evolving beat, and the well-named \\"Rebellion,\\" where Win sings, \\"\\"Sleeping is giving in/no matter what the time is/Sleeping is giving in/so lift those heavy eyelids.\\" You'll be emotionally exhausted when it reaches the wrenching finale, \\"In the Back Seat.\\" And it does all this while making you dance too.<br /><br />Most pop or rock songs are focused on \\"He/she left me/cheated on me and I'm miserable\\" or \\"I'm so in love.\\" Don't expect anything so obvious from the Arcade Fire. These are about living life in general, not just one part of it. Why's it called \\"Funeral\\"? Partly the fear of dying without having accomplished something.<br /><br />Musically, it will make your head spin. There's a blend of post-punk, rock, art-rock, pop, folk, classical, and much more -- like a punkier version of Neutral Milk Hotel or Modest Mouse. Woven together are xylophone, shimmering strings, swirling keyboard, piano, violins, and accordians. And they're all set to epic, crashing art-rock and disco rhythms.<br /><br />And Win Butler is about as laid-back as his music. He can belt out tormented vocals like few can, shout, wail, whimper, and just sing. And his wife Regine offers equally angsty backing vocals. Which is a good thing, because it takes good vocals to do justice to brilliant songwriting like \\"The neighbors can dance in the disco police lights.\\"<br /><br />The Arcade Fire's \\"Funeral\\" is certainly a contender for \\"Best of 2004.\\" At the very least, it's a polished and wrenching debut, and likely to get you off your butt and out living life. If joie de vivre had a sound, this is what it would sound like.y angsty backing vocals.

0060590165|4.0|Garth Nix changed the face of dark fantasy (usually just horror with a prettier cover) with his instant hit \\"Sabriel.\\" It provided fans with a unique type of magic, a well-crafted alternate world, and talking animals that were anything but cute. Without missing a step, \\"Lirael\\" follows in \\"Sabriel\\"'s footsteps, with the same dark blend of humor and horror.<br /><br />Lirael is a daughter of the Clayr, but she won't be a full Clayr until she gains the Sight. On her fourteenth birthday, she is the oldest girl to not yet have gained the Sight. After contemplating suicide, Lirael is assigned to work in the library, and inadvertantly sets loose a hideous Free Magic creature: a Stilken that will call other Free Magic creatures and destroy the Clayr. Desperate to deal with her mistake, Lirael calls up the Disreputable Dog (somehow made both of Free and Charter Magic) and soon ends up finding out more about her past -- and her future.<br /><br />Elsewhere, Sabriel's son Sameth is pursued by the Dead, and is almost killed in the process; the only thing he gets for his trouble is a threat from a mysterious necromancer. Sam is supposed to be the future Abhorsen, but the problem is that he's petrified by the things his mother handles easily. And he's helped loose Free Magic on a world increasingly torn by a mysterious masked necromancer...<br /><br />Nix takes the rich world he created in \\"Sabriel\\" and makes it even richer. It's a bit like a melding of typical high fantasy with an early twentieth-century setting (phones, buses, cricket matches, electricity, guns). Old faves like Sabriel, Touchstone, and Mogget appear here (although Mogget's appearance is a bit brief), along with new and equally likable characters.<br /><br />Some readers may not like Lirael as well as they liked the more self-assured, kick-butt Sabriel, but Sabriel knew who she was, where she was coming from, and knew what she needed to know. Lirael is only learning those things, which makes her a more vulnerable, confused heroine. She becomes stronger and more self-assured as she learns more about Charter magery and her background.<br /><br />\\"Lirael\\" has the same balance of humor and horror as the first book. We have things like the bodies of refugees being turned into decayed Dead Hands, the clawed insecto-human Stilken, or just the aura of darkness around the Book of the Dead. But we also have funny things like Nick or the running joke about the Dog and food.<br /><br />The Disreputable Dog is a lot like Mogget, in that she's more than she seems and a handy source of info, but not as quietly menacing as Mogget was. And Sam is endearingly unsure of himself, and is one of the few fantasy characters to be genuinely terrified of his \\"duties,\\" not just apprehensive. His sister was the one character who fell flat; she seemed a little too \\"bossy princess.\\"<br /><br />The biggest problem with \\"Lirael: Daughter of the Clayr\\" is that it ends on a \\"to be continued\\" note. So be sure to have the concluding novel, \\"Abhorsen,\\" ready while you read this book. Dark, funny, creepy, and immensely well-written.vulnerable, confused heroine.

6304493681|5.0|Ghost in the Shell is one of those rare movies that very successfully puts together awesome animation, great music, a solid plot, excellent SCIENCE-fiction, and the very important but often forgotten humanity... extended beyond the human as a unique physical entity. Oshii set the bar quite high in terms of colors, textures, illumination, sequences, and movement of animation. Kenji Kawai's music fits the underlying philosophy of the movie so well that it becomes an integral part of it, making of the Anime an awesome visual and auditive experience. The plot is well developed, with intelligent dialogue, well-defined charactes, and solid foundation on extropy (think cognitive science, pholosophy, nanotecnology, artificial intelligence, psychology, computational neuroscience, and robotics). This movie is cyberpunk at is best. One aspect I absolutely like is it addresses the question of whether or not it is possible for non-human entities to have humanity, particlularly from the philosophical standpoint, and also for an artificial organism to be considered a living organism. I am certain that over time this movie will be considered to be one of movies, if not the one movie, of it genre with most vision towards a very plausible future.
B00006ZSAD|4.0|You know her best as the ethereal voice of Portishead, but in \\"Out of Season\\" Beth Gibbons strays away from indie trip-hop into melancholy acoustic pop, jazz and folk, collaborated with Paul \\"Rustin Man\\" Webb of Talk Talk. This autumn-toned collection is melancholy and pensive, a bittersweet little gem.<br /><br />\\"Out of Season\\" starts off strong with the gentle, plaintive \\"Mysteries,\\" followed by the shimmery \\"Tom the Model,\\" the piano ballads \\"Show\\" and \\"Resolve,\\" jazzy \\"Sand River,\\" and the brilliantly murky \\"Spider Monkey.\\" It finally wraps up with the bizarrely enticing \\"Rustin Man,\\" a wavering outflow of shimmery sonic currents and Gibbons' submerged vocals.<br /><br />The opening lines of \\"Sand River\\" (\\"Autumn leaves/Beauty's got a hold on me/Autumn leaves/Pretty as can be\\") pretty much describe \\"Out of Season.\\" The cool prettiness of Portishead carries over to the folkier, simpler tunes.<br /><br />Beth Gibbons' vocals are outstanding, clear and sensual in just about every song. \\"Rustin Man\\" and \\"Romance\\" are the exceptions. In the former, her voice sounds seductively mechanical; in the latter, she almost sounds like she's parodying a torch singer sometimes. It's a little disconcerting, but her voice is almost uniformly beautiful.<br /><br />The instrumentation is stripped-down to bare bones: piano and acoustic guitar, most of the time. Adding a bit of extra flavor are gentle string accompaniments, and a bit of subtle organ work. And the songwriting goes more towards being moodily evocative, with quiet lines like \\"And those water-coloured memories/Soft as a summer's breeze/You're as pretty as can be.\\"<br /><br />Though a little uneven at times, \\"Out of Season\\" is like a fall morning -- cool, pretty and faded. Beth Gibbons' foray into non-Portishead turf is a solid one, and this collection of autumnal ballads is definitely a keeper.
B0002DB0FO|5.0|Ever since i've moved to a new town and the cable company idiotically does NOT have the WB, i have been suffering through withdrawal from everwood and all the other wb shows. I was addicted to this show from the first episode the first season, all the actors play their parts perfectly and watching Dr. Brown trying to learn how to be a father is amusing yet touching. I miss this show, and i'm so glad that finally they are putting them out of DVD,although i have seen the entire first season, it means the next seasons will be following shortly :-)

B000002J1M|5.0|Finally, They did it!  Awesome, excelent, terrific, outstanding are some words to describe this album. There are no weak lenks on Foxtrot.<br /><br /> I could see smoke on the stage and hear mellotron, bass and harmon sounds in my ears. Suddenly, Peter Gabriel came on the stage wearing batwings and strange clothes. Back on the year 1972 Genesis started to perform this scifi influented song called Watcher of the Skies.  The song was made to classic!<br /><br /> Can Utility and The Coastliners is the one of Genesis favourites. Tony Banks was really first class harmonist who coulu play so skillfully and personal style that I have to really respect his musical skills. Harmon solo is the best part on this song!<br /><br /> Supper's Ready was a major musical artwork! It contained several interesting musical ideas. This song was masterpiece and it was also live favourite in spite of over 23 minutes lenght.<br /><br />All in all, If you are friend of progressive rock music, you should listen to this album carefully. It will take some time to get in Foxtrot's world but it's worth of it.
048623231X|4.0|As I write this, I am a member of a book group that is working through the three parts of Dante's COMEDY.  I am also a fan of Gustave Dore's illustrations, so it was a given that I would get a copy of this to accompany my trip through hell, purgatory, and the heavens with Dante.  After having worked through these illustrations, looking at each one as I read the relevant passage in Dante, I simultaneously feel that any enthusiastic reader of Dante should own this book, while at the same time harboring some mild disappointment.<br /><br />Most of the illustrations are marvelously done.  Dore magnificently captures the inner spaciousness and abandonedness of hell.  The landscapes, the pits, the caverns, the abysses are all marvelously drawn and conceived.  I'm not sure there has ever been a better illustrator than Dore, and in this volume we have Dore at his best.  Or, rather, near his best.  In fact, I found these illustrations disappointing in two regards.  First, virtually all of his human figures look like parodies of classical nude studies.  One of the joys of illustrations by Dore to accompany DON QUIXOTE is the wonderful naturalness of his characters.  Quixote looks very much like we imagine Quixote, and so does Sancho Panza.  But in the COMEDY, Dore's figures look like slightly overweight body builders striking uncomfortable poses.  There is an air of artificiality that I at times find somewhat overwhelming.  The denizens of hell look spectacularly fit and well-fed.  Where are the skinny sinners?  The scrawny reprobates?<br /><br />The second way in which I found the illustrations disappointing is in the depiction of Dante, Virgil, and Beatrice.  Dante is actually drawn to correspond as closely as possible with what we know about his appearance.  We have a host of drawings of him from the century after his death, though it is not clear whether we have any contemporary drawings.  Dante was described as being somewhat lean with a pronounced stoop.  The stoop is in full evidence in all of Dore's representations of him.  Unfortunately, there is no comparable evidence of his being a human being.  He looks more like a chess piece, with little or no movement throughout the entire poem.  No matter what he is gazing upon, there is very little difference in any of his poses.  While Dante in the poem is vibrantly alive, in the illustrations here he seems stiff and inhuman.  Virgil is equally stiff, but he is also astonishingly feminine looking.  In fact, I frequently wondered, before I grew accustomed to Dore's manner of drawing Virgil, who the tall woman beside Dante was.  Beatrice is clearly a woman, but she is drawn from scene to scene as stiffly as the other two principal characters, and seems as a result an unappealing figure.<br /><br />Although Dore produced more impressive work (see either his extraordinary illustrations for DON QUIXOTE or THE RIME OF THE ANCIENT MARINER), this nevertheless remains remarkable stuff.  And while I am not entirely happy with the artificiality of many of the tableaux, they have exerted considerable influence.  Indeed, anyone who has seen Fritz Lang's NIEBELUNGENLIED will see the influence of Dore.  In the end, Dore at less than his best surpasses most illustrators working beyond their abilities.p is in full evidence in all of Dore's representations of him.

B00005JLKB|5.0|This series starts out w/ meteors coming to earth. The meteors land in a small kansas town called smallville. A spaceship crashes and is found by Jonathan and Martha Kent. And smallville begins....Clark was the child from space and is now a freshman in high school w/ some super abilities. His powers include (at this point) the ability torun fast, have super strength, and x-ray vision. Every episode except for about 3 or 4 clark must stop a kryptonite freak, that is a person whose dna has been altered by the meteor rocks. It is up to Clark to stop them all. At school his friends are Chloe, the school reporter, Pete Ross, Clark's best friends, and Lana, the girl who he loves but can't be w/ because of Whitney, Lana's boyfriend. Also in an ironic twist of fate, Lex Luthor, his future nemesis, is friends w/ him in this show. The writing is excellent and the special effects are awesome. Some special effects shots include the meteor rocks raining over smallville, Clark getting hit by lightning, super-fast mode(a rip off of the matrix) which still works well in this show, and a tornado in the seasons jaw-dropping finale.  episode are in order: pilot, metamorphosis, hothead, x-ray, cool, hourglass, craving, jitters, rogue, shimmer, hug, leech, kinetic, zero, nicodemus, stray, reaper, drone, crush, obscura, and tempest. Some hightlights of this season are of course the pilot w/ the opening sequence, tempest, great ending to the season that will want everyone who bought this to go buy season 2, and many other episodes. Extras are deleted scenes from the first 2 eps. and commentaries plus more. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
0671775308|5.0|A book like THE MILLIONAIRE NEXT DOOR has a value that goes well beyond its subject matter: It shows how often we have misconceptions about what is really going on around us. Such misconceptions can stall our progress by having us act in the wrong ways.<br /><br />Unless you had done similar research, you will probably be surprised by at least some of the findings of this book. The millionaires described here remind me of the ones I knew as a child, so the overall picture is familiar. What impresses me is that that model has continued to be true for the 50 years since I was a child.<br /><br />I hope that this kind of research will be continued so it can be tracked to see how the lessons are changing.<br /><br />I read the reviews of this book below, and think I understand why some people were disappointed. I think that many people would like to live an expensive lifestyle and be independently wealthy. That model is not examined here. Perhaps in a future book, that subject should be explored. Also, some people want to know what to do today, and would benefit from looking at those who got to be millionaires the fastest and most recently. That information, too, is missing.<br /><br />The orientation of this study is heavily on how to sell things to rich people, and that is valuable. For example, the richest people I work with will normally ask me what kind of car I drive. They want to hear that I drive an inexpensive car before they feel comfortable with me. I do drive an inexpensive car, a 7 year old Saturn, and that has helped me get consulting clients on many occasions.<br /><br />I think the possibilities of this research are endless if it is turned into best practice research, something that readers are clearly hungry for. But it is a good beginning to simply do the measurements, and learn the value of measurements.<br /><br />To make enormous progress, our reserach has shown that people need to go through the following process: (1) Learn the value of measurements (which this book helps with). (2) Measure every aspect of important activities (something this book starts to do). (3) Measure the existing best practice, and estimate where that will be in five years (this work remains to be done). (4) Implement pieces of other peoples' best practices in new ways for a more effective combination than any one else has done before. (5) Identify the ideal best practice (in this case, get rich quick with little risk -- an example today would be to found an Internet-based business and sell it quickly) (6) Begin to approach the ideal best practice (that might be to establish Web sites and experiment with creating Internet businesses inexpensively). (7) Create the right rewards to motivate yourself and others to get the job done (daily feedback is a good way for many people). (8) Repeat the process. Here's where the main benefit comes in.<br /><br />I hope this model will help you expand on the lessons of this book to become much wealthier yourself, if that is what you desire, or to create something else that you care about.<br /><br />I personally like to help others get rich more than doing the same for myself. I believe that if everyone is more successful, I will have plenty for myself. My personal goal is for everyone to get 10,000 times or more benefit from what clients spend in time, money, and effort on our services and books.<br /><br />Please do read, think aobut, and build on the lessons of this book to meet your life's goals.<br /><br />If you do not yet have written goals, including financial ones, that's an important first step.measurements (which this book helps with).

B0001EFTVA|5.0|Directed by Satoshi Kon (Perfect Blue and Millenium Actress), this animated movie is an unusual journey into the life of Tokyo street people. Three derelicts - a drag queen, a drunk, and a teenage runaway - make a bedraggled, edgy life together on the streets. In the face of thugs who beat the homeless and a brutal Tokyo winter, they have formed a tattered family, protecting and helping each other. One day they stumble across an abandoned baby, and Hana, the drag queen, is determined to keep it. Hana is an outrageous actor, dramatizing every moment, but turns out to have a surprising amount of steel underneath his movable stage. With the reluctant help of Gin and Miyuki, he manages to get food and clothes for the baby, then sets out to find the mother. The journey forces the three friends to draw on all their resources, opening doors into their past lives and exposing the raw wounds that put them on the streets. <br /> <br />I have never seen a Japanese film that portrays this underside of urban life, making me wonder how accepted it was in Japan. The director refuses to pity his characters or make them objects of scorn. The drag queen in particular is full of life, breaking into song and holding onto a kind of noblesse oblige incredibly at odds with his circumstances. Gin is given to drunken self pity, but has an enduring and unjudging loyalty to Hana. Miyuki is a desparate street child, acting with tough bravado while terrified that she has broken from her family forever. <br /> <br />The animation is georgeous and detailed, much more a work of love than the somewhat stilted animation in Perfect Blue. Hana's robes dance across the screen, and even the cardboard and tin shacks of the homeless are lovingly rendered. The final scenes on a windblown Tokyo rooftop are beautiful and eerie. Satoshi Kon's animation work rivals that of Hayao Miyazaki (Princess Mononoke and Spirited Away), and an affection for his characters shows in his drawing. Watch the moment when Hana,homeless and without a dime to his name, breaks into an exuberant chorus of \\"Crimb every mountain, ford every stream...\\" The movie's generous spirit is aptly summed up in a raucous, extremely strange Japanese version of \\"Ode to Joy\\" that plays over the credits.
B00006RINF|5.0|I really loved this album, although if I could I'd give it 4 1/2 stars, just because I wish the vocals were more audible on some tracks.  On a few songs it seems like the instruments compete with and almost overshadow the singing; I wish they had brought the vocals out more when they were producing the CD.   <br /> <br />However, overall it's great...really QUALITY music.  I strongly disagree with some other reviewers' comments about Andrea Ferro's singing...I think his sexy Italian-accented growling is a perfect counterpart to Cristina Scabbia's beautiful clear soaring voice.  It's a great balance between male & female, positive & negative, etc. In fact, I don't like the tracks where Cristina sings alone nearly as well as those where they both sing. <br /> <br />As far as comparing them with Evanescence, I like Lacuna Coil much better, but honestly, isn't there room for both of them on the current music scene?  To me, it's great when ANY female-fronted rock band gets airplay & hopefully Ev will clear the way for more of the same.  And aren't we all a little tired of hearing nothing but angry young males screaming out their post-teen angst over our airwaves?  Come on DJ's, give the ladies a chance!  Now, excuse me while I go buy up all of Lacuna Coil's other CD's.
B00005JN2X|3.0|This movie does a wonderful job in setting locale. It hums with the moody power of Los Angeles.  Before ten minutes have gone by, you will feel as though you are right in LA, practically smelling the summer-hot pavement and feeling lost and small in the yawning, often glossy expanse of the city.  It's the best depiction of a large Western city since Chinatown (LA in a prior age) and Vertigo (San Francisco).   <br /> <br />Too bad the movie is not as convincing in developing a plot and a credible central character.  The premise is great: taxi driver unwittingly picks up a hit man, is forced to escort him to and from a string of bloody assignments, and, in the course of the evening, both men learn something about themselves.  The problem is that the movie doesn't fully deliver on this premise.  We never really learn anything very profound about either of the characters and, though the taxi driver does grow and develop a bit as events unfold, the hit man seems even murkier in intent at the end of the film than he did at the beginning.  From a pure plotting perspective, the story disappoints us by hinging the final act on a preposterous coincidence that throws cold water on any suspension of disbelief we had managed to conjure up during the first 90 minutes.  And the action concludes with, of all things, an all-too-familiar-chase through the cars of a subway train in a sequence designed to manufacture tension and wake us up, rather than engage our interest by revealing something really interesting about either or both of these guys.  It's as though the movie first tries to distinguish itself by being a character study and, when that proves itself to be a bit slow-moving on screen, it reverts to being just another action flick. <br /> <br />Performances are mixed.  This is clearly Jamie Foxx's movie.  Surprisingly, he easily steals it from Tom Cruise, who was extremely convincing as a villainous type in Magnolia, but just doesn't manage it here.  He seems to think he cancompete with great movie good-guy/bad-guy switch hitters-- like Edward G. Robinson, James Cagney and Anthony Hopkins-- by simply holding a blank stare for most of the film and suppressing his usual toothy grin in favor of a perpetual look of concern.  There's one basic thing wrong with Cruise's performance: he's not menacing.  Oh, he does menacing things but it's fairly obvious that the man doing them is just Tom Cruise trying to be frightening.  Tom Cruise didn't lose Tom Cruise in his character.  So we can't, either.  It will take more than grey hair and wrinkles to convince me he's a killer. <br /> <br />
B00028HBKM|1.0|I've tried and I cannot, for the life of me, figure out what the big deal was about this film. IT WAS HORRIBLE. The film lost my attention at the beginning with the bag of silver flying toward Judas in slow motion! Was he using his special time warp powers? CUT THE HOLLYWOOD FLUFF. Then of course came the scene where Judas hangs himself. As he screams, you can see a filling in his mouth!!! These are but a few problems with this waste of film. The acting was horrible, pacing paralyzing and the beatings? Come on, NO ONE could survive, let alone walk, after that. This was not entertaining, thought provoking or moving. It was just plain awful. I'm just surprised that there wasn't a Diane Warren love song at the end!!! I gave it one star because zero isn't an option. If you want to see Jim Cavezial in a quality performance, rent THE THIN RED LINE.
B00005JN7O|1.0|I was thrilled that a new retro-Sci fi movie had come out.  Unfortunatley this movie did not meet up to my expectations.  The entire movie is a gigantic illusion.  The speciall effects are incredible but nothing except for the actors is real in this film.  The entire movie is computer generated.  If they were going to create the movie like this then they should have done a complete CGI like Beast Wars, Finding Nemo, or even Monster's INC.   <br />     Having real actors in a movie that is made of so many special effects kind of hurts the head andthe  eyes after a while.  Needless to say I was very disapointed in this film. <br /> <br />My question is thus: <br /> <br />     Was \\"Taking Lives\\" the reason Angelina Jolie stares in \\"Sky Captain\\"? <br /> <br />--Safe journeys: <br /> <br />David <br /> <br />
0201633612|4.0|A reference manual of best practices in software application design. Best design practices identified and categorized  as patterns makes communication and application of the practice easier and more effective.  It is not difficult for a somewhat experienced developer to learn these patterns and apply them in day-to-day work, given the content of the book and presentation. Each pattern is discussed with information relating to its applicability, participants, consequences, sample code, known uses, etc.  <br /> <br />If you know how traditional mechanical/electrical/civil engineers work, they always have a reference design manual handy. This book serves the same purpose to a good extent.  <br /> <br />Beware, the contents are pretty loaded and you may want to dwell on one pattern for some time, few days maybe, before moving onto the next- this book isn't something you can read even in a few sittings. The authors duely recognize this and nicely identify what set of patterns to start with depending on the experience of the reader. <br /> <br />The only complaint I may have of this book is the nature of examples (Singleton pattern example is one). I wish the authors used more business application examples much like a reservation or purchase order system as it would appeal to a larger developer base (IMHO).  <br />
B00008H2LB|3.0|I'm gonna be very fast here. I'm not a hardcore Linkin Park fan,I do, though enjoy some of their songs. But what I'm saying is: Meteora's predictable. Usually when I start to play this cd, I listen to about 2 or 3 songs and then get pissed off. So all in all: Meteora's good. When I'm in a mood :).
B0001NBMBC|5.0|If you've ever listened to slipknot before, you know about their hardcore lyrics and mindblowing instrumentals. So you have to be prepared before listening to them. <br /> <br />\\"The virus of life\\", is a song off their new album; Vol.: 3 ( the subliminal verses). <br />It is I think, the best song they've written since \\"wait and bleed\\" off their first cd in 1999. <br />I've listened to it a dozen times, and still;  every time I hear it, it still sends chills down my spine. The song itself is basically a death threat to someone, the lyrics are as gothic as they get. <br />I may be biased in recommending this song to you, since I've liked them for four years now. However I do know this band very well, and in my opinion it is their best song yet. Now, some may not like this song solely on the fact that it isn't as \\"fast\\" as many of their other songs, but if you listen to the lyrics, and just enjoy the song touching your animal side, you'll love it. <br /> <br />So basically, if you're in the mood to become at one with the animal inside you, listen to this song, don't pay attention to the fact that its slow, just take it in; and enjoy your release from humanity.  <br />

034544678X|5.0|This book has a lot of information about dogs and a lot of information about owners.  This book comes before a training (obedience) book (if possible) and even before the dog (it has some of the wisest information about dog selection that I've seen). If you have either a training book or a dog or both you should definity read it anyway.    It is fairly easy to read but it is very heavy on \\"behavior\\". Behavior about dogs and humans primarily, but also about primates and even other species. If you are not into behavior you probably will not like this book.  It is more narrative than a lecture.  Many times it reads like a novel.  In some sections  it can be emotional.    I agree that I has some flaws and they can be annoying.  The author does overdue her PhD story and primate behavior sometimes seems repetative and forced.  In spite of these flaws I strongly recommend that you read it if you like dogs or are curious about dogs.
B00004RFCM|1.0|Ughhh....OK, I HATE this show.  I know the women love it, and so do most of the gay boys.  Well, I'm a gay boy, but to me this show is like the straight female version of \\"Queer As Folk\\" - i.e., a relentless pandering to the stereotypical stupidities of a particular demo.  To mention only one minor point: no straight man would ever be interested in any of these women, so the \\"sex\\" part is immediately suspect.  But of course this show isn't actually about sex - it's about clothes clothes clothes.  Which brings up another point: why do women feel that it's empowering to be represented as vapid label whores?      What's worse, this show has allowed people like Sarah Jessica Parker and Kim Cattrell to actually think that they are hot stuff, so now we'll have to look at endless shampoo commercials in which they try to appear \\"sexy\\" (or something) for the camera.  I swear, the next time I see SJP on a magazine cover looking like somebody just smacked her right in her ugly mug (her version of \\"sexy\\"), but obviously really just modeling her several thousand dollars in threads and bling, I'm gonna barf on the newsstand.  Besides, I'm pretty convinced she's a drag queen - like a bad one, like the kind you'd see drunk on the bus at midnight - in spite of her alleged children with (the obviously gay) Matthew Broderick.  Then there's Cattrell, who is like some kind of dessicated blond debutante that probably turned heads once, you know, sometime back in the eighteenth century.  Again, only her gay fans find her attractive, and that's more of an academic thing.  But of course, the very mediocrity of their looks is one of the true reasons these women are such a hit with women.  The SITC \\"girls\\" all have a steady stream of hot young studs pandering to their vaseline-lens fantasy of themselves as liberated, desirable women, and the female viewership feeds off this vicariously.  To the effect that you really are more likely, in this post-SITC world, to hear a throng of middle-aged women at the next table cackling loudly over the poor sexual performance of their respective mates, as an occassional break in their otherwise nonstop dissection of the latest Dolce & Gabbana catalog.      Sorry, but \\"IMHO,\\" this show does nothing positive for women. Actually it makes for a fairly airtight explanation of the historical ascendancy of men - we rule the earth because you're too busy matching obscenely overpriced handbags with grotesquely expensive shoes.  Not that I really think this of women (necessarily), but just as \\"QAF\\" would leave you with the impression that all gay men are conceited, puerile, sexaholic idiots with recreational drug habits, \\"SITC\\" firmly entrenches females in the old stereotype of shallow, catty, emotionally stunted fashion plates whose sole idea of \\"empowerment\\" is to be lit well as they pounce victoriously towards the camera swathed head to toe in somebody's Name.  Sigh...

B0002IVN9W|5.0|this isnt mary ellen wiliams. this is her son who spends most of his time here, but has no money. well. so far ive only heard the two mp3s on their website and they are the most beautifully depressing and happy trhings i have ever heard. definitely for fans of broken social scene and if you dont own that album, youre stupid. i havent got the cd yet but the two songs are worth 5 stars alone
B0002Z0EYA|5.0|It's true, Troy varies greatly from Homer's The Illiad.  But, as anyone whose ever studied it can tell you, The Illiad was not much more than a massive work of Greek propaganda.  Troy makes the Trojan War seem like any real war is.  Realistic, first of all.  The Greek gods all played active roles in the war, killing and saving people that they favored, almost at will.  But also, something rarely shown in movies; both sides are sympathetic.  Throughout the movie, different characters on both sides of the war envoke different feelings, and characters such as Achilles and Patroclus are deserving of just as much sympathy as Hector and Priam.  The cast performed most of these jobs exceptionally.  Peter O'Toole has a wisdom on screen very similar to Richard Harris' performances in the Harry Potter movies.  Brad Pitt and Eric Bana did a great job of bringing true internal conflict to characters that, in the books, did tend to lack depth when battle was near.  Many people complain that Orlando Bloom gave a poor performance as Paris, but few seem to remember that in the Illiad, Paris had practically no redeemable qualities whatsoever.  It seems that in Troy, although he never truly steps up and fights with a sword (obviously excluding his fight with Menelaus)-which is very true to the book-Paris is constantly torn, because he has never been a warrior, and doesn't know how to be one.  Not many people seem to notice that situation.  The debate of a man being a lover or fighter has been around as long as the two ideas have.  But in The Illiad, love is a slight consideration next to honor and glory.  The aristocratic warrior ethos is the ultimate possession of any man in the days of The Illiad, so when a man like Paris exists with such conflict, he is simply looked at as whining and weak.  Altogether, I would say that the movie is a fantastic adaptation of the original epic, and anyone who can accept that the movie will be quite different from the book should definitely see it.
0156027321|4.0|Like many people, I think, I found it hard to get through the middle part of this book, but it was well, well worth it in the end.  The end of less of a twist, more of a \\"here is reality\\" ending, that makes you go back and reread pages to piece the entire story together.  While not a particularily intellectual read, it's definitely a good one that you can pick up in the evenings before bed -- it's thought provoking if you want it to be or an easy read if you don't dig too deep into it.  The religious references were particularily interesting, although I wish they would have been carried more throughout the book.  If anything, it's worth the read, just don't get frustrated in the middle.
B0002EXH5O|5.0|I am not an avid follower of Thrash, but I thought of adding a few to my collection. Just to mention my favourite metal band is Iron maiden & 70's King Crimson! So I first bought Metallica's \\"Master of puppets\\", which liked from my third listening but I am hooked to \\"Rust in peace\\" from the very first listen which my second thrash album.<br /><br />Megadeth is a good band, I am now ready to listen a few more from them. Marty Friedman & Dave Mustain plays together in this album, so guitar department is rock solid and Nick Menza gives them good support with his usual bombastic drumming.<br /><br />Although all the tracks are very good, if I need to mention a particular track that got me hooked, it has to be \\"Tornado of souls\\", a truely edge of the seat rocker in every sense of the word.<br /><br />Even if you think you have outgrown listening metals, it may still provide a good energatic listening and it is essential for metal fans. Oh..I should also mention the cover of the album is great.<br /><br />Note:- The Cd I have was the one without the bonus tracks.
B00000JY1X|3.0|I see that many seem to love this set of CDs, so perhaps I just don't \\"get it\\". I found this set of CDs to be annoying. The lyrics seemed stupid and repetative to me, and as if anyone could have come up with them. I agree with the assessment that the music itself was interetsting - that is the only reason I give this 3 start instead of 1 or 2. I will keep listening - it wouldn't be the first time a CD took me a while to appreciate. For now, though, I don't like this at all.
B00001OH7Y|5.0|A couple of months back I reviewed \\"Heroes\\". It was a very satisfying album for me, more so because I like so called art-rock/Progressive rock & ambient kind of music. I bought \\"Heroes\\" & \\"Scary Monsters\\" together. Two very different albums but almost equally good and definitely a 5 star album. This particular album released in 1980 is influenced by 80's music (and many 80's music was influenced by Bowie). <br /> <br />It starts with a raunchy rocker which is sung partly in japanese named \\"It's no game, Pt 1\\". When it ends rhythmic \\"Up the hill backwards\\" starts and then the title track...which has some great sound effects. Bowie is really innovative on this song wen its come to usage of effects. Then comes the funky yet sentimental \\"Ashes to Ashes\\". Great tune. Disco tinged \\"Fasion\\" follows. \\"Teenage Wildlife\\" has some king crimsonish guitar from Robert Fripp (Fripp plays guitar on 7 tracks on this album and he rocks), which sounds great. \\"Scream like a baby\\" & \\"Kingdom come\\" are good but a little weaker than the rest, so the velocity slows down a beat but Bowie picked it up again with help from Pete Townshend who plays on \\"Because Yu're young\\" and the album end with a bang with It's No Game, Pt. 2 (no japanese this time). <br /> <br />It is said to be Bowie's last great album. So if you are into discoish kind of music but want to try Bowie, better start with this one...If you like Bowie then get this as soon as you can. Not to be missed.
B0002ZDVEU|4.0|WAYYYYYYYY better than the first, although, if you suffer from vertigo or take the drug \\"Stematil\\" for medical reasons , it's best not to see this film or you wont make it out of the movie theatre in one piece! Why only 4 stars? Because the camerawork made me so dizzy, I felt like a DJ on LSD in an amsterdam nightclub. I know that the director made the camerawork a little NYPD blue to emphasise the feeling of desperation and quick moving action, but c'mon already!! It's a good plot , good acting , crappy camerawork (which really wasn't needed), and unfortunately a lot less killing then the first movie, but still good to watch ( if you're prescription glasses are over 10+ ).
B0000BYM3K|5.0|From \\"Wildest dreams\\" to \\"Journeyman\\", great tracks one after another. Maiden pulls off another miracle with its 3 lead guitarists line up. The lineup has all 5 member from the classic era + Janick Jars for the second time after \\"Brave new world\\". The result is ....ummmm....melodic & delicious. <br /> <br />This album is very symphonic and the three guiatarist advantage is more interplaying of the guitars to produce that classic sound of Powerslave, Seventh son of seventh son. I like it. I wouldn't describe each track separately. Best track of the album are \\"Rainmaker\\", \\"No more lies\\", \\"New Frontifier\\" and there is not a single weak track. So metalheads...Go and get it to believe that they are B-back.  <br /> <br />Iron Maiden again proves why they are the best in the business of METAL.
B000002KNI|5.0|Simon and Garfunkel's `An American Tune' is, in my opinion, one of the most beautiful songs they ever made together. Though it is not their most famous song, its meaning is timeless, and it is softly and consistently revealed as the song rolls on. The comforting sound of the guitar and their two harmonizing voices is so classic, so peaceful.  <br /> <br />      I came across their music through my parents, who were both at the Simon and Garfunkel concert in 1981 at Central Park. They introduced me to Simon and Garfunkel's music in about my tenth grade year of high school and I have been a devout fan ever since. The sound of their music, especially their live album, has always been able to transport me to another place, almost make me feel like I was there in 1963 with my parents cheering and applauding with them.  <br /> <br />      Regardless of the time it was created, anyone who has ever felt confused, made mistakes, and can accept life as it is and as it will come can relate to the song. It is a song Paul Simon wrote about the two men's journey and their career in music, but also about life in general - an understanding that everyone suffers and learns and grows at different points in time, and that in the big scheme of life, we've \\"lived so well for so long.\\" It was also written in the midst of America's most historically split time period; many in the country were for Vietnam, and many, including Simon and Garfunkel, were against it. The meaning of the song also reaches a bigger picture that the twosome believes: things will get better, and this is still America, their country, regardless of the current stress of the war. Even though many of Simon and Garfunkel's original listeners were predominantly doves, the song was meant to bring peace to those so angry and to take an introspective look on what was happening in the country.  <br /> <br />      In essence, it is almost inevitable to be taken in by the song. It begins with Garfunkel's soft voice and then he is joined in the second verse by a harmonizing Paul Simon, the acoustic guitar and very few instruments in the background playing ever so lightly. It is a simple song, but its meaning is profound, and almost everyone will find some meaning in it.  <br />
B000050FEN|1.0|Taste is always subjective, particularly when it comes to humor, so reviews aren't too helpful, but I didn't care for this movie. It just didn't make me laugh. The Beavis & Butthead thing that Freeman and Pitt had going just didn't work at all. Kevin Spacey's eventual arrival brightened things slightly, but it was far too little, far too late.  Well, I'll admit I might've grinned or chuckled just a little a few times.  The fat man being forced to eat himself to death made me smirk, as did the lady getting her face cut up. And I'll admit that I did laugh out loud once during the decapitation part, but that's kinda cheap because decapitation is always funny.  But a few funny scenes ain't worth the money or time.
B00004X0Q0|5.0|ATDI is one of the best bands of all time, they do not sound like any band I have ever heard, and this CD is their best album. Now I love The Mars Volta even more then ATDI, but that doesn't mean ATDI is not good. You shouldn't be listening to The Mars Volta if you never heard ATDI it's not moral, I got into TMV because I was such a ATDI fan, if there was no ATDI there would be no Mars Volta, so ATDI haters sit down and stop being emo wusses
B00003CXBK|5.0|I really love Hayao Miyazaki's work and when I first saw Princess Mononoke, I was really happy to watch it. <br />It has such a nice story and few things that deal with japenese legends like the kodomas and someone said this was supossed to be in japan, but I find it odd there was wolves in it, but I dunno if they're native.. <br />Ethierway this was a great anime to see and is no way comparable to disney films there was no previous movie or manga before this was made so it's not really coppying like what disney does with things like bamby, alice in wonderland(sp?), and a few others.. <br />Also there is nothing wrong with anti humen why because there is too many shows where animals are some evil creatures, I really liked it where nature was goodguys for once.
B00005JMAH|2.0|In comparison with the first two Harry Potter movies, this film does not do the books justice. The characters are under-developed, large chunks of the plot are missing or inaccurate, the location of filming was moved - so this is NOT the \\"original\\" Hogwarts, and the feel of the movie is too dark to be appropriate. The acting is a bit better in this film in comparison to the first two, but there are several over-the-top, \\"cheesy\\" moments that ruin the general feel.  <br /> <br />This movie could have, and perhaps should have, been at least an hour longer than it is to ensure that the audience is not left with a \\"huh?\\" feeling. As a Harry Potter fan I would probably buy this movie just because I want a whole set - but I wouldn't buy it until it's very inexpensive - or until someone else is willing to buy it as a gift.  <br /> <br />In either case, it will sit on the shelf and definitely won't be watched nearly as often as the first two films.
6300182355|3.0|Everyone else has said it. It is a perfect reincarnation of the classic cartoon and the old TV series. Deliberately hokey effects, wonderfully cheesy and cliched acting topped off by Queen's profoundly silly soundtrack! A film that produces many chuckles. Von Sydow is a wonderful Ming, Brian Blessed booms and shouts as usual, what-his-name is wooden and hopelessly stupid as Flash, and Ornella Muti is utterly and appallingly appealing to any hopeless male adolescent as Princess Aura. My favorite line is when she says \\"I LOVE initiation ceremonies...\\" What did happen to her? Such lips, such...but enough of this fantasizing, this is a film that is completely tongue-in-cheek and very amusing. It has a plot - the usual kind of sci-fi thing. I only give it three stars as in the pantheon of film making it is hardly Ingmar Bergman is it?
B000002J09|5.0|Why is it that all overrated albums sell from 14 - 20 million records in five years? like 'Nevermind' (Nirvana), The Black Album (Metallica), Back in Black (AC\DC, well this one kinda deserves to sell 19 million records) and Led Zeppelin IV. Dont get me wrong, this IS an awesome album, but with only 8 songs, 4 of them great and the other 4 okay then its hard to imagine why this album gets all the hype. Physical Graffiti did it for me, in my opinion that was the best Zep album but this one didn't come close to the greatness of PG. The 4 great songs on this album are 'Stairway to Heaven' (you were expecting that, werent you?), 'Black Dog', 'When the Levee Breaks' and the greatest ballad ever 'The Battle of Evermore'. I would say 'Rock and Roll' but after all the GMC commercials using that song it really pissed me off. I like this album, I love this album and the reason why is because not of its sales but its sheer brilliance. Buy it now!
B0002F7I9Y|5.0|Like the last studio album by the late Johnny Cash, Ray Charles's \\"swan song\\" is a fitting conclusion to a career that spanned almost five decades.  The twelve-set collaboration with those that are legends in their own right is a splendid blend of familiar songs, slightly altered to suit both Charles and his partner.  Music fans will find something to savor among this eclectic bunch.<br /><br />\\"Critics\\" of this album fail to realize that the singer was ill at the time of these recordings; thus, he may not have been \\"up to par\\" vocally, but the trademark soul of this major musical talent could not be abated.<br /><br />His partners were keeping good \\"company\\" when they signed on to accompany Charles, praising him on the disc's liner notes.<br /><br />Legends of his caliber don't deserve less than five stars!
B000002WPI|5.0|I gotta say that Hip Hop is in a very sad state nowadays. &quot;Artists&quot; who got no flow or talent whatsoever keep popping up like diseases. Not only that, but they keep bringing in there posse who usually have less talent than them. If you want good hip hop, go back a few years. This album is the cornerstone of a good hip hop collection. For the most part, all Wu Tang members have talent. They all have there own distinct sound, made better with the great production skills of the RZA. Enter the Wu-Tang does not take a few listens to get into, you'll notice the distinct East Coast sound right away. Can't say I've got a favorite track altough C.R.E.A.M stands out the most(from my perspective). Anywho, if you don't already own this go out and get it. If you do then you know why it's good.
B00009V7T2|4.0|As other reviewers repeat ad infinitum, these guys are good - astoundingly good.  Their creativity is apparent to anyone who gives this album an open-minded listen.  If De-Loused doesn't grab you the first time, a second or third listen is sure to win you over, at least to the realization that Mars Volta possesses a rare talent that stands out among today's many generic \\"edgier\\" bands.<br /><br />De-Loused in the Comatorium reveals beats and chord progressions that evoke the later albums of Voivod, although more melodically.  The vocals, higher in pitch than what most of us expect to hear from a male vocalist, have a certain Geddy Lee ring to them, without the looseness and annoying quaver that plagued Rush.  Some find the vocals annoying, but their clarity and versatility seem to win most over.<br /><br />My major gripe with this album lies not in the work of the musicians, but in the production.  The mixing is simply substandard.  There is a faint, and I'm sure unintentional, distortional hiss to much of the lead guitar, that I found distracting.  But this paled in comparison to the very understated bass.  Though you can hear the upper stretches of the bass guitar clearly, there is no real depth to it, and the bass drum(s) and lower toms really lack punch.  This album barely moves a subwoofer cone a millimeter.<br /><br />But, in my opinion, ultimately, it's worth it.  The album's musical merits outweigh its production deficits.
0385504209|5.0|Conspiracies, religion, art, murder, puzzles, questions, Jesus Christ, Leonardo Da Vinci... all rolled into one.<br /><br />I'm not a historical buff nor an art buff, but one thing I learned most from this book was Da Vinci's life and work than I ever did in my college courses. Art classes just teach you linear perspective crap about Da Vinci's work and very little on his life. Brown gave a better insight on who Da Vinci is, what he did, and why he did it.<br /><br />Religion is a touchy subject in this book. I'm not a religious person, but I still know some things about Jesus. But the \\"facts\\" listed here raise more questions on that. It seems to question Catholicism and the Church and most importantly, the Bible.<br /><br />I'm getting ahead of myself. Even though it's a work of fiction, I just can't help but want to delve deeper into the past of many artists mentioned (including Walt Disney!), the life of Christ, and the Bible. Maybe Dan is persuading the readers to solve puzzles they may have encountered while reading this book.<br /><br />The book overall is a thrilling read. A murder leads to something bigger than anyone could ever imagine. Descriptions on artifacts and certain historical figures give readers a better picture. I won't go into details on what the book is exactly about and who the characters are. The only thing I could say is, this is a great fast-paced thriller with a few historical facts tossed in. If you have nothing to do on your free time off from work and/or school, pick this up.
B00005JMAH|5.0|\\"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban\\", released in theatres in June 2004 and on DVD/VHS in November of the same year is, simply put, the best of the series thus far.  Alfonso Curon expertly guides the characters towards maturity while simultaneously preparing Harry's psyche for the realization in Book/Film 4 that the magical world of Hogwarts is more than a fantasy land of child's play, it, like the real world, possesses very real, very mortal dangers.  Fans of the first two films may, as many of their compatriots, balk at the abrupt change between Curon's gritty-fantastic world and his predecessors softer, child-safe world that has been displayed in excruciatingly slow detail for the past two feature films just as many fans of the novel series balked at the death of Cedric Diggory in Book 4 and Harry's irritating but age-appropriate mood swings in Book 5.  Progress, as they say, is good- and natural.<br /><br />Fans who also demand that the movies regurgitate every line and scene from the book series will likewise be disappointed; many popular (but not key- come on people, there is a difference) scenes are missing and many fresh (and wonderful) scenes have been added.  The additional scenes add color and \\"reality\\" to the normal parts of Harry's extraordinary life while the missing scenes do not, overall, detract.  The reshuffling of the Firebolt scene does, admittedly, allow for a messy conclusion and the CGI werewolf is atrocious but neither flub is so great so as to warrant docking stars/ratings.  A reported additional 20 minutes of footage will be included in the DVD which may soothe the ruffled feathers of some fans but those who are entirely unable to cope with the shift in directors and condensation of the books (under JKR's guidance, mind) should not only not purchase this product, they shouldn't bother with any of the future films either.
038551123X|5.0|Well, those who have voices in their heads certainly have an new hero! What makes this book so different than all of the other \\"dark fiction\\" (Leroy, Ellis, Ballenger, Palahniuk, Rowling(just kidding on the last one) is that this one doesnt chronicle the Dexter's spiral into darkness. I am not giving anything at all when I say that it is quickly established that Dexter is firmly off his rocker. This doesnt sound like much when reading the synopsis, but it makes for a blast of oxygen as you quickly turn the pages of this book. Added bonus: living in the mind of a madman for this many pages.
B0002S94OS|5.0|This cd freakin rulz, i've listened to this new cd more times in the last 2 weeks, then i've listened to As the palaces burns in the last year.  these guys are only getting better. bands like this, Amon Amarth, Mastadon, Enforsaken, Shadows fall, In Flames, Susperia, Into Eternity, Carnal Forge, the Project Hate, Arch Enemy, Suidarkra, Hatesphere, Within Y, Solar Dawn, Ensiferum, sentenced, dream evil, Raunchy, Kataklysm, Heaven shall burn,Lyzanxia, etc etc etc, is what metal is all about. some of these bands are american some are european, but they all rule, turn off mtv stop supporting all this corporate crap on the tube and support these bands i just named off, there's many more like these bands waiting to be discoverd, Lamb of god was in the right place at the right time with the right music, and hopefully it will filter down to some of these other band that deserve as much if not more respect.u might have to look for some of them like i did but when u find them u'll be rewarded with metal beyond your wildest dreams. some of these bands i've mentioned have put out some of the best music(metal) in the last 10 years but u woulnd't know if u've been tuned to vh1 or mtv, Amazon is a great place to start searching for some of these bands but they don't have them all , i find most of mine at TheEndRecords, also amazon.uk,  Hope this review was helpfull , hope i opened a few eyes to a few new bands, metal is what music is all about. i'm biased of course, but if you've heard of and listend to half the bands i've got an listen to u'd understand. so go out buy the lamb of god cd listen to it and love every second of it because it's going to be in the top 10 releases of 2004. and do yourself a favor and broaden/expand your horizons and give some of these other bands a listen to u won't be disappointed if u r into any type of metal, be it , pure metal, thrash, death, hardcore, melodic, viking, whatever it's all good.

B00028HBKM|5.0|Absolutely the most breathtaking movie I have EVER seen, and I am 50 years old!<br /><br />Whether you are a Christian or not, I think this movie would touch each and everyone's very soul.
B0001KZM3O|5.0|I loved the final cut since I first heard it, but since they included \\"When the tigers broke free\\" on this remastered version of it, I love it even more. Its true that this is more of a Roger Waters album than a Pink Floyd album, but the music is absolutely. If you liked The Wall, you should at least give this disk a chance.
B0002IU988|5.0|I don't think I have written a review for a cd so that in itself says alot about what I think of this cd. I am a huge Creed fan and was very disappointed when they broke up. I'm not a fan of any group getting a new lead singer and had no plans to buy this cd. I had seen the video for 'Open Your Eyes' on VH1 a few times and the song started to grow on me very fast. Let me tell you, I bought the cd and have had it on my cd player at home, work and in my car. It is wonderful. I am shocked at the music and how good Myles vocals are. It did take a few times thru to grow on me, but it ROCKS. Don't pass up on this. Mark shines on guitar and you can tell there is some freedom in his playing. At first I thought \\"this song would be great with Scott Stapp on vocals\\", but now I am blown away at the vocals. Man, Alter Bridge is good, very good. Take a chance on this and give it a few times thru before you make a judgement. Wonderful cd. AAA+++
B00005MK9Y|5.0|I originally had this as an eight track tape , the cd is a must have if you enjoy listening to music at all . <BR>Simply put &quot; dem not ave dis in dem collection , thin dem not ave an ear for reggae music &quot;.<BR>nuff said.
B0002S94BG|5.0|I just recently got into Jeff's music & I am still reeling from the beauty, honesty & sheer brilliance that is in his stuff. I just picked up this \\"Legacy Edition\\" of \\"Grace\\" about 3 hours ago, & I have to say that it is beautifully packaged with expanded artwork, a gorgeous tri-fold case that holds the 2 cd's & the DVD of the making of \\"Grace\\", & of course, extensive commentary on the bonus tracks in a very attractive booklet with lots of stunning photos of Jeff & his band. If I sound like a fanatic, it's because Jeff's music & words inspire such incredible passion in fans of his music.     <br />For those not wanting to plop down $26 or so dollars for such a beautiful work of art, then I strongly suggest that you scrounge up $12 bucks & buy the \\"Grace\\" cd. After hearing that, I guarantee that you'll jump head-first into the gorgeousness of Jeff's legacy.
0812550757|5.0|Ender's Game was a great book but did not have near the depth of character's and story of this book.  I may go out on a limb here and say this is close to the best Science Fiction Novel I have ever read.  I certainly rank it with Dune and 2001 which is pretty lofty company.  Card writes in the forward of this book that Ender's Game was really just written in preparation of this book and as I look back on both books it is obvious that is the case.  If you read Ender's Game and thought it was great be prepared for a totally different novel.  Ender's game could have been condensed down to 10 pages to prepare you for the Speaker of the Dead but the latter could not.  I enjoyed every single page.  This book was a unique combination of mystery & Sci Fi that kept me turning the pages.
B00009V7P8|5.0|I first heard this cd when I was in Ireland.  I basically stole it from my flatmate and refused to give it back.  It's really that good.  Damien Rice does such unique things with each song.  Each and every one is lyrical, originial, heartfelt, and truly beautiful.  I also really like the female vocalist on this cd.
B0000X61UU|5.0|Much more fun than the first video. Cindy really helped me change my lifestyle 5 years ago after my second pregnancy. Doing these exercises every day or at least every second day or combining with the first video to make it all more interesting - shows real results within two weeks. Regarding the injuries some reviews mentioned - I have no idea what they re talking about. A person should listen to his / her own body, wheather the demonstrator gives explicit instructions or not... I had no problems with pain during or after the exercise (well except those pains telling me the workout was effective). And believe me I was a real beginner, in a very bad shape at the start... It was hard at first and I had to finish earlier with some sets. But being stuborn though careful I was able to follow up Cindy completely within couple of weeks.  <br />Can t wait to receive the last Cindy s DVD I just ordered.
0812932293|4.0|Whilst the success of the Virgin Group is undeniable, \\"Losing My Virginity\\" reveals that the company is led by a gambling megalomaniac driven by an insatiable urge to emblazon his name in the headlines. Two incidents in particular strike me as clear examples of why Richard Branson is an unfit leader for the group. <br /> <br />The first was his decision to stake the entire future of the Virgin Group on the success of the airline company. It is universally acknowledged that the introduction of the airline business posed an enormous risk to the company as a whole. Whilst I can understand one man's desire to gamble his stake on a high risk venture, what is unacceptable to me is the incredible willigness with which Branson is willing to risk not only his own stake, but that of his friends and life long business partners who also had a share of the group. <br /> <br />The second incident that appals me is the willigness with which Branson risks his life despite the presence of a family who rely on his support. I suspect his intent was to garner gasps of admiration from the audience for his apparent bravado, however I can only wholeheartedly express my disgust. I can certainly understand why a single man would engage in such a thrill seeking adventure. However, to gamble not only your own future but that of your family is an act of a man whos ego dwarfs the size of his balloon. <br /> <br />The book makes it difficult to judge his skills as a businessman, however as a person Mr Branson exemplifies the \\"me first\\" philosophy which unfortunately has become so common in modern life. Despite my criticisms of Branson as a person the book itself is an enjoyable read and contains many moments that I am confident the reader will enjoy.
B0002IU988|5.0|2004 is the year of the spinoff band. Velvet Revolver, Damage Plan, and now Alter Bridge. It seemed that Creed frontman Scott Stapp, like Roger Waters(Pink Floyd) and Zack De La Rocha(Rage Against The Machine) before him, grew tired of a democratic band setting and flew the coop. So what was left of the band hired singer Myles Kennedy and redubbed themselves Alter Bridge. It doesn't sound as much like Creed as one would think. Open Your Eyes and Broken Wings sound like they could very well have been Creed holdovers, but otherwise this is Soundgarden meets 3 Doors Down. Myles clearly doesn't sound like Scott Stapp, which has gotten mixed reactions. Scott's voice was smoother, but Myles has a little bit more range. He does sound alot like Chris Cornell, as others have pointed out. But he intersperses some operatic Geoff Tate wailing and a whiskey soaked blues vocal. The real surprise here is Mark Tremonti's guitar work. Mark got to strut his stuff a little bit on Creed's first album, but after that he was pretty much downgraded to hired gun status. Now he has the freedom to play his way, bringing to mind Glenn Tipton, Slash, and Kirk Hammett. Those that did not like Creed generally cite the heavy-handed religious overtones in the lyrics, not really preachy but certainly pretentious at times. Thankfully, Scott has taken that with him, and the lyrics here are closer to the Audioslave style of songrwriting: subtle and introspective. In conclusion, if you liked Creed, then give Myles a chance, if you didn't, then check this out anyway because you might like the changes that the infusion of new blood has provided.
B000286S8S|4.0|Overall a pretty good compilation, just not enough songs! The three live tracks are from the \\"Live: Right Here, Right Now\\" CD which isn't that great to begin with, why not just use some old soundboard recordings instead? Or a 3rd bonus disc with the Gene Simmons VH demos?
B00000IAU3|5.0|The song is very emotional and it cultivates a feeling of being caged in. She wants to get out of her relationship, to see the world, to taste the fruits of chances, again. <br /> <br />A short song it has a lasting message.

B0001ZX0OW|5.0|The first thing I would like to recommend about Mystic River is that you watch it twice before coming to any conclusions.  Not that it will change the mystery, but so you can fully appreciate what the actors and filmmakers achieved with this movie.<br /><br />It an old plot line of tragedy occurring in the bloom of youth that affects the lives of a group of friends later in life, but Mystic River goes far deeper than most of the stories that follow this path.  I haven't been this overwhelmed by this particularly downtrodden plot since Lorenzo Carcaterra's \\"Sleepers\\" (the book, NOT the movie).<br /><br />Jimmy, Dave, and Sean (played by Sean Penn, Tim Robbins, and Kevin Bacon respectively) were childhood friends growing up in a \\"working man\\" neighborhood, when a cop stops to confront them about carving their names into fresh cement on the sidewalk.<br /><br />The \\"cops\\" take Dave away, but they weren't cops; they were child molesters.  Dave is held captive by these monsters for four days, until he manages to escape.<br /><br />The movie then skips to present time, roughly thirty years later, and picks up on the lives of the boys.  Dave is married, marginally employed, with a young son of his own and dark memories of his past.  Sean is a detective, with an absent wife that telephones him at odd hours and says nothing.  Jimmy is married, three daughters, and owns a corner store.  Jimmy also has a criminal past, and an active relationship with the Savage Boys, neighborhood tough guys.<br /><br />Jimmy's nineteen year old daughter, Katie, is brutally murdered, and while Sean heads the investigation of her death, Dave retracts more into his own world, hiding a dark secret.<br /><br />Is Mystic River a riveting movie?  No.  Is Mystic River the kind of mystery that has you on the edge of your seat?  No.<br /><br />Although there is a pleasant twist in the ending, there are no surprises and no biting of fingernails.<br /><br />What you will feel is that tingle of dread creeping along your spine, a vague horror constructed of real life tragedy, a shivering echo of \\"what if\\", all portrayed superbly by this stellar cast.  Tim Robbins is always great, but his portrayal of Dave's tortured mind is provocative and stunningly realistic; this may be Robbin's greatest performance to date.<br /><br />And I never expected Sean Penn to develop into such an exceptional actor, Mystic River really is his finest hour on screen.<br /><br />So yes, the movie unfolds at a slow pace, but at no point did I find myself bored or loosing interest in the storyline.  The acting was inspired, the storyline is a fresh twist on a used plot, the mystery enough of an unknown to keep the pace, the dialogue believable, and the horror kept well hidden in the shadowy corners of your own imagination.<br /><br />Over all, I highly recommend this movie.

B000028U0Y|5.0|Of all of Johnny Cash's albums, this is the one that means the most to me.  Cash, in his music, has always been as honest and brave as possible.  He has taken faith, love, and murderous sin and looked them square in the eye.  There's no irony to shield his ego in this music.  He sings of sin and hope openly and in the same breath.  And he's taken his music to the prisons, which really seems fitting, when you think about it.  If there's one theme that ties all this music together, it's the struggle inside every human to reconcile their imperfections with their aspirations.  And the criminals in this audience, probably deservedly, have their imperfections laid out for the world to see. <br /> <br />The best part of this album is his interaction with the prisoners.  They holler and cheer when he sings of murder, and they grow deadly and reverently silent when he sings of death and hope.  When that deep, resonant voice sings to bring hope to the most desperate of men, it can't help but bring hope to the imperfect souls who aren't locked away in Folsom, but still could stand a little saving, now and then.

B000001DTM|5.0|This is one of the best Albums I have ever heard. ALL the songs are great, which is almost impossible in this day and age. Artists only include 2 or 3 good songs in each of their albums. But this one rules!!! I am a U2 fan. I have all their albums and this is one of my favorites. Although the roots are the same this one has a different kind of music from the one of previous albums.
B000002O4X|5.0|Incredibly romantic song in an incredibly romantic setting. Imagine a picnic at night in Africa and hearing lions roaring in the distance and an old-fashioned \\"Victrola\\" playing \\"Let The Rest of the World Go By\\" while you and Robert Redford are looking into each others' eyes. WOW! Well, my Dad used to sing that song to my mother while she accompanied him on the piano. He had a warm baritone voice, sea blue eyes and a deep love for my mother. My sisters and I just silently sat and watched them loving each other with their eyes as he sang to her. For us, it didn't get any better. I don't think John Barry wrote that song, but it was a perfect fit for the scene, and it brings back precious memories for me. John Barry probably wasn't even alive at that time because the song was popular during the era the film depicted. This may not help much, but just hearing that song again brought tears to my eyes. The score has the same deeply emotional richness as Barry's \\"Somewhere In Time\\", which is another gorgeous theme to dream by.

They are difficult to predict, more difficult to hedge and even more difficult from which to profit.<br /><br />3.  Marketing timing matters.  Big gains and losses are concentrated into small time periods.  News events such as earnings or economic announcements drive stock market prices.<br /><br />4.  Prices leap suddenly.  This adds to risk.  News announcements compel investors to act simultaneously and instantaneously.<br /><br />Using his fractal tools, Mandelbrot describes how financial markets work.  He describes the volatile, dangerous and in a unique way, strangely beautiful properties that for which few financial experts account.<br /><br />This book is a must read for any serious investor.

Aware that cancer was taking its final toll, he assembled luminaries Willie Nelson, B. B. King, Elton John, Bonnie Raitt, Van Morrison, Norah Jones, James Taylor, Diana Krall, Natalie Cole, Michael McDonald and Gladys Knight.<br /><br />Although his voice is obviously weakened by his disease, the results are magical.  Too often a CD released following the death of a legend generates a sense of mourning among the legend's faithful followers.  This collection, however, gives comfort.  While we mourn our loss, it grants solace, placing Ray Charles' great career in perspective.<br /><br />Life's richness is in what is handed down from one life to the next.  Ray Charles undoubtedly impacted and changed music during his six decade career.  It celebrates his contributions and those who were influenced by his life and art.
0790729628|5.0|This film was and still is a gem, an auburn jewel of cinema.  Ridley Scott, a former commercial director, finally got his chance to make movie history.  This film is the very first, the ultimate classic in the cyberpunk genre.  Needless to say, when this was made it was YEARS ahead of its time.  They had no access to real computer graphics back when this was made.  It is almost all done with light, shadow, and amazing photography effects.  And, strangely enough, that is why this film remains impressive - because most of the effects are natural and real, instead of being some kind of computer rendering.<br /><br />This was a cult favorite in America.  However, this film exploded when it hit the international market, becoming an absolute smash hit in Japan.  The influence of the American film, \\"Blade Runner\\" can be seen in countless Japanese films and animations.  So that, one could say that Ridley Scott gave birth not only to a great film and a new genre, but also to hundreds of Japanese animes inspired directly from \\"Blade Runner.\\"  One need only look at something like \\"Ghost In The Shell 2\\" to see the direct inspiration.<br /><br />The most important and memorable thing about \\"Blade Runner\\" is the lush mood and atmosphere generated by the superb production crew.  The soundtrack from Vangelis also draws you into this deep work of art.  An exploration of technology and how it changes the definition of what it means to be human.
B00005JNEI|5.0|Yes, that is how I feel about Moore's treatise of the events since the 2000 election.   I didn't think that I was the only one who noticed all those strange coincidences.  I'm grateful that he's made a movie for the average person, who in this day may not have to his or her disposal the meanings of the words, fascism and genocide.  Alas, there are still those even smaller minds (e.g., the person who wrote \\"Moore Trash\\") who awarded the DVD, Alex & Emma, with five blazing stars.  I do think that so-called romantic comedy remained in the theatres a bit longer than it took George the Second to get up from his seat in that Florida classroom after the second plane hit.  And it is probably nicer \\"to believe\\" in a vapid fantasy than to face the hard truth.
B000002J09|5.0|What can I say?  This is the hard rock album of the '70s.  THE album in highschool, everybody had it.  Blues based, but they took the blues further rhythmically than anybody before or since with the exception of Capt. Beefheart.  And by mixing American blues with English/celtic sensibilities they created something new.  The classics on the album we've all heard a billion times: Black Dog, Rock and Roll, Hairpie to Steven and they're still great.  But is the more obscure songs that I really love:  Four Sticks, When the Levee Breaks, Going to California and especially the Tolkienesque Battle of Evermore.  This album really shines above almost everything Zep ever did because its got a feeling unique unto itself, an odd gothic sort of atmosphere that I can't quite describe, as though it was ancient and new at the same time.  Maybe its the mixture of the blues with celtic folk, acoustic with electric that gives it this feel.  Maybe its because of Jimmy Page's infatuation with Aleister Crowley:)  In any case its one of the greatest albums of English hard rock ever made, a classic.
B00005JKNF|3.0|Calling this movie a murder mystery violates the Trades Description Act. Even calling it an \\"Agatha Christie Country House Murder\\" is misinformation because none of Christie's detectives are involved, and it's frankly not in her style. When you first read a Christie story, you don't know who did it until the last chapter. There is no mystery about this murder. The only conflict about it is \\"Will the people in the house at last catch on?\\" and \\"Will they tell?\\"<br /><br />So, don't buy it if you are expecting thrills and chills.<br /><br />This is really \\"Upstairs / Downstairs\\", set in 1932, [twenty to thirty years from the days of Mr. Hudson, Rose and Mrs. Bridges]  Nothing has greatly changed on both levels, except that this upper class are on a higher social strata than the Bellamys. Country house folk, instead of urban political folk.<br /><br />The 'upstairs' folks are stock characters. Dame Agatha and P.G. Wodehouse used their types often; but both authors would have made them less 'boring'. There is the rich industrial tycoon, Sir William McQuorkidale (or something like that) who now lives the life of a country gentleman, and his relatives-in-law, who feed off his wealth because a)they can't run a successful business or don't know how to work or b) were brought up to think work is beneath their class.  The only persons who do work are Ivor Novello (a real-life entertainer; but Sir William's fictional cousin) and his American producer friend. There are two female upstairs characters I pity: Sir William's daughter Isabel (the poor-rich kid who's being blackmailed) and Mabel, the wife of a twit who squandered her money and now despises her middle-class manners. Mabel is well acted, and she shows more spirit at the end of the film.<br /><br />  The interesting, believable people are the servants. The film shows their attitudes to their jobs, to each other, and to their employers. Very little subservience there. Several major British actors playing those roles. The added 'perks' on the DVD about the authenticity and the commentary by the writer, whose family was upper-class, are worth watching to understand how this film is not a mystery at all but a sort of fictional 'day-in-the-life' of a stately home between the wars.  (Fans of the BBC documentary 'The Victorian Kitchen' will enjoy it because Ruth Mott was the technical advisor for the kitchen staff)<br /><br />  I thought it was cheeky to cast Stephen Fry as the bumbling inspector. This is the same time period as P.G. Wodehouse's 'Jeeves & Wooster' tales. Fry, dressed in 'thirties garments, looked enough like Jeeves masquerading as a Scotland Yard Inspector to make me think Hugh Laurie should appear as Bertie Wooster. The film producer, the pompous dignified butler, the foolish drone Lord Something or other [if not his leach of a friend] seemed send-ups of Wodehouse's comic characters.<br /><br />There are some very witty put-downs sprinkled through the film. Jeremy Northam's Ivor Novello is a treat to listen to - but not for long periods, as Maggie Smith's character points out. Some of the more interesting characters' scattered subplots would have been interesting. (Will Elsie end up in Hollywood or in the gutter? Will Mabel divorce Freddie now that she's stood up to him? Will Mary become 'the perfect servant' or will she leave the countess?) The set designs and lighting are worth appreciation if you are a film student. Also the contrast between the lanquid movements of the upstairs people with the haste and almost constant scrubbing downstairs.  I appreciated the women's clothes. How 1930's upper class women looked so elegant during the Great Depression is a study in itself.<br /><br />  People who watch History Television / The History Channel will appreciate this film's period details; but there's no plot, no mystery, nothing to hold your attention.

B000002JSJ|5.0|Much more cohesive and modern sounding than its predecessor Physical Graffiti, Presence is an astonishing return to hard rock form.  There are no keyboards on this album and acoustic rhythm guitar on one song, the rockabilly-like Candy Store Rock (its buried in the mix).  Presence is heavy from start to finish with seering leads and funky metallic rhythm tracks.  The first track Achilles Last Stand is an amazing, galloping, psychedelic, metalic romp.  For Your Life is slow funky metal that grooves deep.  Royal Orleans is a funky jazzy strut complete with congas.  See a pattern here?  This album is about groove, first and formost.  Almost every song is a funky take on the blues and I gotta say the rhythm section of the two Johns is especially good, being both nimble and powerful.  If there was ever a Zeppelin album that was John Bonhams and John Paul Jones, this is it.  Nobody's Fault But Mine is a truly classic reworking of a blues standard thats miles from the original.  Candy Store Rock is a rockabilly-like burner and Hots On For Nowhere is a joyful rocking shuffle.  On the last tune, the soulful &#34;Tea For One&#34;, Zeppelin show their roots in a slow sexy blues that showcases Pages prodigious lead capabilities. Presence is Zeppelin's last great album and is among their best.  After the sprawling ecclecticism of Physical Graffiti, Zep decided to ditch the experimentation and put out one of its tightest, hardest, funkiest and musically cohesive albums of their career.  This thang rocks.
0765301598|3.0|The book and plot were reasonably well-written and well-developed. However, nothing can comparable with Dune itself. I read the book at my local Barnes and Noble. The one thing I was disappointed with was the 'betrayal' of Abulurd Harkonnen---this was poorly characterzied. What exactly motivated Abulurd to betray ideals and values that he had shared with Vorian for the better part of the preceding 2 decades? However, that said, it is always a treat to re-enter the Dune universe, however fleetingly...
B000002JSN|4.0|Its overlong, and there are no &#34;classic&#34; songs in the Black Dog vein (well maybe Kashmir)  And no, not everything worked: the album could have used some editing.  But I rather like this album because Zep stretched out and tried new things. Their willingness and ability to take chances makes Physical Graffiti a very good, if not an excellent album. There's a lot of variety, from the manic slide blues of &#34;In My Time of Dying&#34; to the fun piano driven hoedown of &#34;Boogie With Stu&#34;, to the metalic funk of &#34;The Wanton Song&#34; to the countrifried &#34;Black Country Woman.&#34;  Its not all serious, and its not all great (none of it is bad either).  Physical Graffiti is kind of an ecclectic grab bag but a very enjoyable one.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|The latest \\"A Perfect Circle\\" record, \\"Thirteenth Step\\", has shattered many expectations and has managed to make itself known in the world of alternative metal. With its dynamic rhythm blended with hooking melodies, \\"Thirteen Step\\" is indefinitely worth checking out. APC crunches hard with tracks such as \\"The Package\\" and they cool down with melodic tracks like \\"The Noose\\" and \\"Crimes.\\" The CD's title derives from the Alcoholics Anonymous twelve-step recovery program, because much of the material on the album relates to drug addiction and recovery, except for the song \\"Pet,\\" which stands out all in itself. <br />  <br />The song \\"Pet\\" has much relevance to what we are told about in today's society. Originally the song was meant to voice the United States invasion or Iraq, but to find that one must carefully find the connection. The entire point of the song is that groups of people are being controlled like \\"sheep\\" by the \\"new world order.\\" The ones in power are trying to keep their influence on the people with propaganda saying they'll \\"hold you and protect you\\" and that they won't let \\"the boogeyman come.\\" \\"Pet\\" relates to the current Iraq situation in the sense that the United States takes over the nation and forces their influence on the people by saying that they are the ones who are going to be the protectors. The protectors however are going to maintain their order by keeping the people ignorant and \\"safe from truth and choice\\" and keeping the people brainwashed. The writer of this song, Maynard James Keenan, has never written a song about war, but unlike many Americans he decided to vent his frustration with everything in the world through his music. Through his use of metaphors he was able to project the situation through a melodic song. The way the song goes from dynamic, hard rock to a soft melody is amazing in the way it makes the listener feel moody, bring them up to excitement, back to moody, and then finally end at excitement. Overall, the songis very original and represents how some people can be truly passionate for a cause through music. <br />  <br />The rarity for a sophomore album as good as \\"Thirteenth Step\\" is drastically low, but APC has managed to pull off their best work to date. The CD is 100% worth the purchase and their live show is stunning.  <br />
B00000AFHM|4.0|Belle and Sebastian is one of those bands I have been meaning to listen to for a couple of years. I always got distracted by some other find or some other band to listen to. In the back of my mind I kept meaning to come back to them. I heard a couple of songs before but it was brief. <br /> <br />I just bought this album and amazing is all I can say. Its chamber pop only better than most because its so damn smart. It just sort of takes you by surprise because its recognizable and so unique too. I am not an easy critic and I love this band and plan to spend more time with them. <br /> <br />
B00003CXCT|1.0|If George Lucas feels these classics need 'adjustments', that's his decision to make.  Do whatever you want with them, Mr. Lucas.  Just make sure that the millions of people who MADE YOU RICH, and loved the movies just the way they originally were, are able to choose which versions to watch. <br /> <br />But that simply is not the case, and while I'll be the first person to admit - 'they're just movies' - I'm still upset and sad about these dvds.  The original version of any movie should be respected and preserved.  The ground-breaking work provided by hundreds of people who were part of the crew really deserves to be remembered, not replaced.  Not just the crew, in fact, because now even original cast members have been jettisoned:  the origninal Emperor from 'Empire' has been removed, Sebastian Shaw's final appearance at the end of 'Jedi' is gone, and the actor who spoke Boba Fett's lines has been excised.  It's disgraceful. <br /> <br />I understand lots of people are just happy to have the Star Wars Trilogy on dvd in ANY form.  Not me.
B00004VWAF|5.0|In 1973, Miles Davis was fuming.  He had released On the Corner a year before to negative reviews and an apathetic public; and now, his sideman Herbie's fusion record Headhunter's was on its way to becoming the bestselling jazz album of all time.  In his autobiography, he whines about how Columbia doomed the record by not promoting it correctly.  Personally, I don't think Miles has a leg to stand on.  Even if Columbia had put massive amounts of money behind it there's no way it could've stuck in 1972.  Columbia had only one hope: Hire a team of brilliant scientists who would build a time machine, and drop this album on the public 40 years in the future.  That's right, 10 years from now.  We STILL aren't ready for On The Corner... <br /> <br />There are so many dismissive complaints leveled at this album- it's repetitive!  there's barely any melody!  It's not even Jazz!  You hardly every even HEAR miles!  I have no counter argument; these are all facts.  However, there have been a few things that have been missed by its critics: <br /> <br />Miles had a vision with this record.  This wasn't just a street record, this was intended to be THE street record.  The ultimate black-power world-encompassing fusion call-to-arms.  He intended to reach his black audience- the world's black audience. When you hit play on this record, you are on EVERY dang corner in the world: Los Angeles, Dakar, Nairobi, New Orleans, Havana...  This is THE fusion album.   <br /> <br />The album is thoroughly immersive.  I can't think of a denser album, or an album that rewards repeat journeys better than this.  At first it's entirely impenetrable and almost hostile to the listener, but once you find a way in there's a world of details and fascinating characters to discover.  Take the first 30 seconds; when you hit \\"play\\" you seem to have been dropped into the middle of a muddled fusion stew.  It almost seems sloppy; but listen close and you'll realize you do have a proper introduction- the first30 seconds are an inversion of the following minute, Miles in front, Liebman in back.  Then at 30 seconds, the wall of drums hits, and you get the exact same scene again, only inverted- Miles has been thrown to the back and Liebman is right in front of your speakers.  Very clever; Stockhausen would be proud of this tape manipulation.  It tells the listener: here, time folds in on itself; Miles will NOT be the star; you'll have to pay REALLY close attention...You've entered a parallel world... <br /> <br />And, finally, the best argument for the enduring genius of this album- there is nothing that sounds like On the Corner in the canon of recorded music before or since.  Nothing so bewilderingly experimental yet funky, or that fuses different cultural musics into such a seamless whole.  The density and layering of this album is relentless, the solos enigmatic.  It exists outside of classification.  That is quite a recommendation- To this day, On the Corner stands completely alone.  Give it a chance- it can take you places that no other album has gone!
B0002KVUKM|5.0|I have no idea why so much people think this movie is lame, or bad. I found myself very enjoyable watching it actually. You get everything in one movie, Frankenstein, Dracula, Werewolves. And this 3 species are related perfectly. <br />Well of course the Draculas blood sucking wives can be prettier. Grr..
B0002IQNAG|5.0|So, what are you getting: 4 dvds with 3 different versions of the film with commentary on each. The fourth disk has a couple of documentaries (including Roy Frumkes \\"Document of the Dead\\"). Why does this collection rock? Well, if only for the European Cut which contains none of the library music that Romero used. Instead we get the complete Goblin score. I don't know why George used library music, but it doesn't compare to Goblin's tracks. I prefer the European version over all the others just because it is tighter and has the superior soundtrack. There's really only one gore effect missing and that's the chopper beheading. The US theatrical version is the same that was released earlier this year. The extended version is interesting and contains more mall footage and some slightly extended scenes. All in all, a great collection, but really only for true fans. I saw this film twice at 2 different drive-ins and it's release on DVD was much anticipated and welcomed.
B00005JNEI|1.0|Michael Moore wants to tell the truth?  How fortunate for him that the \\"truth\\" is making him millions of dollars. The only thing this film makes me thankful for is that Michael Moore does not hold a public office.  I urge you to be a responsible citizen and not get your politics from a malicious filmmaker or any other such source.  And as for honesty and telling the truth, I'd sooner believe Bush than Moore.
1881273156|5.0|When I finished reading this book, all I could think was, \\"Boy, I sure wish I knew this stuff to begin with!\\"  I think we all realize, without reading this book, that people communicate differently and have different personality types.  However, Chapman takes it to a whole new level.  He explains with stories of his own encounters, how he has come to find these love languages.  I wasn't left with a vague feeling at all because Chapman's writing is very calculated and intentional.  This is a must-read because expressing love to others (friends, lovers, family, neighbors, strangers) is what its all about, but knowing how to love them so that they will feel the fullness of it is what is hard.  Chapman makes it very easy!
6303407188|5.0|I watched this movie for the first time last night after buying it and I enjoyed it so much.This movie has such a sweetness about it. Ed is such a  kind hearted sympathetic guy that you can't help but root for him all the way and cringe when he gets a setback.I thought it was so sad when Bela died.The film had so many touching moments. <br />Johnny was a perfect Ed. I think he captured him perfectly and gave an honest fair portrait of him. Its  tragic that the real Ed died without ever seeing the cult status and recognition he enjoys today. <br />Another great thing about the movie is it had that total 1950s  creepy atmosphere which I absolutely love. I highly recommend it.
0812550757|3.0|Even though I would have preferred something a little more straightforward after Ender's Game, this was still enjoyable.  It's a cool little mystery, and the science in this science fiction is cool.
B0000DD7LC|5.0|The song \\"Diary\\" from Alicia Keys had an impact on me because I was drawn by the actual melody at first. The piano melody and the mellowness of the song had me hooked from that time and still to this day. Now in accordance with the lyrics, in listening to them everyone whether male or female can find a correlation between them and their own life. Whether it is what they want in a mate or if they deem themselves that type of person anyone can find something in the lyrics pertaining to relationships that they can relate to. On a personal level I can find so many parallels with the lyrics and my own personal life, either a must have in a boyfriend or reflecting on the type of girlfriend that I am. This song makes you think about your own relationships past, present, and future in such a positive light. The impact of this song seems small yet it really is large because of the amount of contemplation that you enact after listening to it. <br />       Now from Ms. Keys point of view I believe that this song is written from experience in relationships both good and bad. This song is just in written form a promise that she makes to them and does not break. I believe she is expressing her deepest feelings through being loyal. Trust is an important part of a relationship and she is making a good point that she is capable of being a good girlfriend because you can \\"just think of her as the pages in your diary.\\" The reason behind why she wrote the song was probably to get all of those emotions and thoughts off of her chest and she knew that other people could relate to the same type of experience. This song is so deep I recommend it to anyone who wants something easy to listen to and a clean song that has a positive meaning and will affect them in an optimistic way. <br />
B00005JMAH|4.0|I'm looking forward to the release of Azkaban on DVD.  I'm very excited to see that it looks as though about 20 minutes have been added to the running time of the movie and hope they have added many other extras.  I agree with the many people who said that some important aspects of the book were omitted from the movie, such as Hermione's reason for having the time turner and why she gives it up in the end, the growing antagonism between Ron and Hermione over Scabbers/Crookshanks which was a major part of the story, Crookshanks' association with Sirius, the shape of Harry's patronus, Padfoot, Prongs, Mooney and Wormtail, etc.  Inclusion of these elements would have made this movie much more fluid and understandable.  However, I did like some of Alfonso Curion's additons.  I really enjoyed the scene of Harry, Ron, Seamus, Dean and Neville eating the \\"animal\\" beans, Buckbeak's intervention when Harry and Hermione are attacked by Lupin, Ron's \\"playing up\\" his injury with Hermione, etc.  The design of Buckbeak, Lupin (as the werewolf) and the Monster Book of Monsters were phenominal.  J.K. Rowling even infered that unbeknownst to Curion, some of the elements he had added into the movie were elements she had thought to use in future books (I'm thinking something to do with crows??).  I'm really looking forward to this DVD release and to next year's Goblet of Fire (my favorite Harry Potter book!)
0061015725|3.0|A good story, with some great ideas and a good overall plot line. I must say however that the general feeling of the book seems \\"rushed\\". Quite a bit rushed really, as if the author had a really tight deadline to meet. I can't help the feeling that this wasn't really written with being a book in mind so much as being a movie. As a film this would probably be very good, but as a book it's lacking the substance that the movie visuals would provide, hence my feeling. <br /> <br />Still a good read, but perhaps one for the train where you don't want to get too absorbed. <br />
0140177396|5.0|Steinbeck's writing style is fantastic, and this story lends itself to dicussion in high school classes. It's not overly complex, but the issues raised are limitlessly debatable. I didn't enjoy it quite as much as GRAPES OF WRATH because MICE doesn't have the same epic feel, but still it's a fantastic book that everyone should read at least once.
B000244EMO|3.0|I was a big Alien fan and I was a big Predator fan when it first release in Malaysia. The first time I remember watching this movie, I thought this is a cool hunter and not to mess with. Then came the VCD (Video Compact Disc for your information) version of Predator and then came the normal DVD version. I felt there was something more towards this and waited and waited until... Fox release the Predator (Widescreen Collector's Edition) inconjunction with AVP movie. <br /> <br />Received it, watched it and what can I say... its almost there to satisfaction but its better than the previous version. <br /> <br />Everything that you need to know about how the movie was made, the effects, the story an the silliness of the first costume ever made, plus the actor/stuntman that wears the Predator suit (in memory of him), the interviews, the outtakes & 1 deleted scene AND a special featurette on AVP & trailer of AVP (NO PREDATOR TRAILER!) is all here. <br /> <br />Still, you won't mind cashing out for this edition and any fan of Predator would want to add this to their collection as well.
0590353403|5.0|All the hype got to me. It's good, for all the reasons everyone else says.
B00003CXCT|4.0|This trilogy is amazing, Star Wars(not star wars the new hope, its just star wars), Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi.  The thing that ruined the whole star wars thing was the new ones, Phantom Menace and Attack of the clones.  Thats Complete B S, There are three star wars, and these last two were just for money purposes, they're horrible movies, thank god they are not in the collection.  I mean, come on, who put Samual L. Jackson in a Star Wars Movie and Expects it to be god, bwahahahahahaha.  But the trilogy itself is gonna be awesome, except for one thing.  put the theatrical releases in there, nobody wants the special edition, it ruins the movie.  The special editions aren't classics, the classics are the ones first shown.  Who the hell like star wars and complains about the originals.  Thanks George Lucas, you sell out.  Other then that the DVDs are gonna be great.  Oh yeah, and why do they say phantom mennace is the first star wars movie, its not.  the first one is just Star wars, you know why, because it came out first, look at the copyright, thats the way it goes.  Maybe it was writen first, which i doubt, but doesn't mean that it is the first movie.
0060920084|3.0|Bryson's one of my favorite travel writers. Hilarious. A Walk in the Woods is my favorite of his. This one is about his travels around small-town America, which isn't as interesting for someone who knows what small-town America is like. And I thought Bryson's sarcasm was a little snotty and mean in places, but pretty enjoyable.
0767812166|5.0|Definitely worth watching. If there are really aliens out there-and if you are reading this you probably hope there are as much as I do-they should all be like Jeff Bridges. This movie will make you laugh, maybe cry, and just feel good about life. I watch it whenever it's on cable. Maybe God will send aliens like this to save us from ourselves.
0316776963|5.0|Hilarious. I see people reading this on the subway, and I watch for the smile. It always comes. Laugh-out-loud essays on everything from speaking German to turds. A little crass at times, but that never bothered me much. Maybe the funniest book I've ever read.
B00005R2M3|2.0|I think Shakira is a very talented composer and singer. She has done what few others were able to accomplish in the Spanish Music World- combine pop and rock using thoughtful, well written lyrics and good beats. Plus, she was able to get Colombia more attention, bringing exposure to other talented Colombian artists.  <br /> <br />Unfortunately, she does this well in SPANISH but not in English. Being that I am 100% bilingual in English and Spanish, it is hard not to compare. I am picky about BOTH of my languages.   <br /> <br />Shakira did not study the English language long enough to delicately translate her ideas and thoughts into her music. When I first heard the lyrics, I thought, are you kidding me??? They sound as if they were made for a 10 year old. They are 10 times less deep, unique, and poetic than in Spanish, and this ruined the music for me. What is more surprising is that not many others must have noticed, since she sold so many albums!  <br /> <br />I guess she had to hop on the \\"latin explosion\\" train here in the U.S. before the U.S. forgot, again, about it's latino populations(haha). She couldn't wait a few more years to produce excellence in the crossover language...oh well, that's what marketing and fame is all about. <br /> <br />Hopefully her next album will have more QUALITY in English. If not, I am not willing to give it another try. Sorry Shakis!  <br /> <br />En espaol, sigues siendo reyna...
0142000663|5.0|Never read it in high school. I'm glad because I don't think I would have enjoyed it as much. Perhaps the best ending of a book as I have ever read. Seriously almost made me cry, which a book has never done. Guess that's why it's a classic.
B00028HBKM|5.0|From what I understand, this is one of the most historically accurate movies ever made. However it shows just how much God loved us.... He sent his Son to die for us.  I have never before seen such a powerful moving movie as the Passion of the Christ.  <br /> <br />It is certainly not an entertaining movie, but it is a very important movie to see. And I encourage you- if you are unsure of the validity of the movie, do some research at how the movie was made and it's historical basis.  <br /> <br />
B00003CXCT|5.0|For the DVD release and I can hardly wait to get my hands on it. The picture is crystal clear, the colors are vibrant and the sound quality is amazing. Yes I too owuld love to see the 'classic' versions (digitally cleaned up only - remove the dust and scratches) as an archival work but for now, I'm looking forward to having my all time favorites on DVD.

B0002S94OS|4.0|If there is a buzz-band in the world of metal at the moment, Lamb Of God would have to be that band. If someone would have told me 4 1/2 years ago when I bought \\"New American Gospel\\" that Lamb Of God would be the next big thing, I would have laughed in their face. Initially, I thought Lamb Of God was decent but nothing to write home about. \\"As The Palaces Burn\\" was a marked improvement in every facet and upon listening to their hellbilly take on Slayer's \\"Hell Awaits\\", I was taken from indifference to complete interest.<br /><br />To say that I was right alongside everyone else waiting in anticipation for \\"Ashes\\" would be an understatement. Before hearing one song, I proclaimed through various outlets that we were about to hear the album of 2004. I made a point to show up at this year's OzzFest to start my day off with Lamb Of God which would have started things off on a good note by missing all of the poser goth-metalcore bands playing earlier in the day. Unfortuntely, I missed most of their set but from the 2 songs I did witness, I was as ready as ever for \\"Ashes Of The Wake\\" to hit stores.<br /><br />Despite it's being released with a few other albums I was anxious to hear, I truly thought that \\"Ashes Of The Wake\\" was going to come out on top. Upon my first listen, I was a little taken back by the super slick production. The rawness of \\"Palaces\\" was missing and the guitars sounded a little bit thin. Also, the solos seemed more sporadic and less memorable upon first listen. My immediate reaction was \\"Ehhhh....it will grow on me.\\". So far, it has and it hasn't.<br /><br />Before anyone decides to fold their arms in a huff, take this into consideration: \\"As The Palaces Burn\\" came out a little over a year ago and it was about 2 1/2 years in the making. Almost a year to the date, \\"Ashes Of The Wake\\" is released on a major label and amidst the OzzFest tour. There are just some things about this album that don't stick with me the way songs from \\"Palaces\\" did. Randall Blythe still has one of the most brutal voices in the crop of modern metal vocalists but his little speeches before and during a few of the songs are completely out of place. They remind me of KRS-One doing the stupid shout-out on the first Sick Of It All album. Also, the overuse of the f-word strips away from of the serious tone of the message contained therein. Musically, there are some damn memorable riffs mixed in with some more rehashed sounding riffs that fails to make the songs overall memorable.<br /><br />Looking back, I sound more like I'm panning this effort. Basically, I'm merely stating that the large leap forward from \\"New American Gospel\\" to \\"As The Palaces Burn\\" is absent in the hop-in-place form of progression here. Had Epic not been so eager to release something with Lamb Of God's name on it, they could have taken the fall and winter to deliver and completely brutal and memorable album for spring 2005. Instead, Lamb Of God unleashed a solid album that sound not too unlike \\"As The Palaces Burn\\" but in the grand scheme of things, an average record from an incredible band like Lamb Of God will always plow the best effort from a nu-metal poser band like Disturbed any day of the week.dall Blythe still has one of the most brutal voices in the crop of modern metal vocalists but his little speeches before and during a few of the songs are completely out of place.

B0001NBMBC|5.0|The first album, mate.feed.kill.repeat was a pretty good album, but their self titled mainstream debut blew it out of the water.  Then came Iowa... which was a step down from Slipknot.  Vol. 3 is a step back up, and beyond, Slipknot.  Great album, even if you do not like Slipknot's first 3 albums.
B0002S94OS|5.0|This is what metal has needed for a long time, this is an amazing cd. Although it is not as heavy as as the palaces burn it is just as good if not better.
B000053VAF|5.0|Chasing Amy will probably remain my favorite Kevin Smith film, but Dogma should always have a close second. After turning the Mallrats fiasco around with Chasing Amy, Smith decided to embark on his life's work, the one film that he'd been saving for just the amount of exposure it would get: Dogma. Though not a Miramax production or even from Universal (thank God), Lion's Gate decided to option his masterpiece and Columbia released it on DVD. Go figure. <br /> <br />Anyway, Dogma is about several characters in a looped story structure. Ben and Matt are two fallen angels trying to get back into heaven by entering a sacred, but before they do they go off and brutally kill people for fun. Bethany Sloane is a direct descendant from Jesus Christ (which still makes no sense to me since Jesus was an only child and never married, but don't think too hard about it) who has to stop them from entering or they'll destroy all of God's creation. Along the way, she has some help. Alan Rickman is Metatron and the sardonically witty English bastard he always is, Jay and Silent Bob are prophets who want nothing more than to bone Bethany at any cost, Chris Rock is the 13th Apostle and offers the angry black man's view of things, and Salma Hayek is a stripper who turns out to be Serendipity (???) However, the always loveable Jason Lee is a demon sent to make sure that B&M make it to the church and thus rein havoc on heaven. Anyway, it's a fractured fairy-tale and a clever one at that.  <br /> <br />Some key moments: The first thing that stuck in my head after I first saw the movie was the scene in the Moovie corporate office. I won't give anything away, but it just completely disturbed me as how all this sin is revealed and then punished so brutally, then dismissed as nothing. Who knew that Matt Damon could be so evil? Especially as an angel? <br />There's the final realization from Bethany where she doesn't want any of this responsibility, which does play off of the original Terminatorsome, but Rickman carries the scene with an almost poetic pose. <br /> <br />The reason why this film works is for its initial farce on religion, then a showing of a more reasonable way to embrace it. Sure it's a comedy, and a foul-mouthed Kevin Smith comedy at that, but it delivers a way to question your own faith (whatever it may be) and to decide for yourself of whether you follow beliefs, or ideas. A high recommendation for and movie collector. <br />
0385510438|3.0|While this book is expertly written, I was, I have to admit, a bit disappointed with it in the end.  I may be fickle, but I like a good fast paced legal book, and this book was advertised similarly to his previous books.  So, I was a bit disappointed that this book was a slower paced book that really had more to do with life in this small town than the legal heroics of the situation.  I suppose I pre-prejudiced myself against this book, thinking it would be similar to his previous ones.  It is a very well written book, and interesting to boot. The characters in the book, especially Willie Traynor, are well developed and cleverly written. Recommend it as a good read, just don't come into it with any pre-conceived notions!
B00005JKHP|3.0|This is a meditative, thought-provoking, and emotionally absorbing movie.  It is not perfect, and was not perfect in it's previous two incarnations, but Robert Wise and company took a very brave stab at a mature piece of science fiction.      This movie is often regarded as a poor beginning to the big-screen Trek series.  Obviously I disagree, but I will give credence to some of the arguments that frequently dog this movie.  Too slow?  Sure it is, in places.  Dated effects sequences?  Yes, but therein lies the rub:  they've remade scenes for the dvd release, a la 'Star Wars'.  I do appreciate that Mr. Wise was in control of this updated version, but I cannot excuse the fact that Paramount could have easily given us a no-frills transfer of the original release as a \\"bonus.\\"  I do enjoy the documentary features that were included on disc two (although this is far from the highlight of the 2-disc Trek releases so far), but I'd gladly trade them in for a simple transfer of the original film.      All the debate over the new Star Wars dvds prompted me to rethink my stance on the rejiggering of this movie.  I snatched it up on the day of release, and am actually very pleased with the version presented.  Unlike some of the jarring intrustions of modern technology found in the Star Wars films, the new effects blend rather seamlessly here.  Of course, it must be noted that there are also numerous trims and edits throughout.  At the very least, all of the material that appeared in either the original cut AND the expanded tv version that was released on VHS is included on the second disc.    All the nitpicking aside, this is a staggering movie that still packs a great punch after all these years.  But I am always in favor of preserving films in their original version.
0380789035|5.0|There is no one else that can tell a story like Neil Gaimen, and there is no other story like American Gods (except maybe the Sandman series, hehehe).<br /><br />As with any Neil Gaimen story, when I wasn't reading the story, I spent time pondering the themes and subtle existential questions that the characters experience during the course of their incredible journey. From the very first page, the plot twists and turns unpredictably, and by gradually revealing the nature of the imaginative characters, bringing ancient concepts into a new light.<br /><br />A fascinating adventure I'd recommend to everyone.
B00006AW2G|3.0|I check this album out from a local library i had high expectations for it. I thought the rolling stones they are a ledgendaring band they must be good. What i can tell you is i was seriusly let down. I dont know only listen to it once had some good tracks but defintly not worth buying. I think maybe i just needed to give it some mre spins or i had been listening to the new york dolls to much and thought it would be more up beat like that but i don't know the rolling stones still did alot for rock and roll and only worth buying for historical value.
0060090383|4.0|I have read all of Marian Keyes' books and this has, by far, been my favorite. It is the story of Rachel who has just entered a rehab center. Parts of this book get depressing, but there are also lots of funny parts as well. You just want so much for Rachel to get out of rehab and do good with her life....it is a wonderful book!
B000002BYA|5.0|Stevie Ray Vaughan and Double Trouble's performence at Carnegie Hall is great including the Roomful Of Blues Horns, Jimmie Vaughan, Dr. John, and Angela Strhili who has a great renedition with Stevie Ray Vaughan. Their are alot of great blues tunes including C.O.D. with Angela Strhili WOW!! I also like the live version of Scuttle Buttin', and Honey Bee. Their is also a different rendition of Pride And Joy with the Roomful Of Blues Horns that sounds really good with Horns. Their is also a really great performence of Lenny that I just think is great compared to the live performence at ElMocambo! Im sure everyone would appreciate this live recording at the one and only carnegie hall. Enjoy!

B00003CXCT|1.0|Lucas must have some kind of mental disorder.  'Star Wars' was nominated for Best Picture.  The three movies earned gigantic sums of money.  A whole generation loves the movies beyond words. <br /> <br />In 1997, the 'Special Editions' were a lot of fun to see on the big screen.  I, like so many others, was thrilled to see the new additions and surprises.  I didn't realize then that those editions marked the end of Star Wars in it's original form. <br /> <br />Now the 'Special Editions' have become even more 'special', with - as many have documented already - lots of additional \\"surprises.\\"  I've had enough.  Putting Hayden Christensen in the end of Return of the Jedi really takes the cake.  Bottom line: whether you think the new movies (Phantom and Clones) suck or not (they do), I don't want to see cameo appearances by the new cast (especially in what was one of the most emotionally satisfying scenes in the trilogy: Luke see the spirits of Yoda, Obi-Wan, and his father). <br /> <br />I have resigned myself never to give Lucas another nickel.
B00003CXCT|4.0|Star Wars Trilogy gag reel (on the bonus disc):<br /><br />Go to the Video Game & Still Galleries menu page. Press 11 on your remote and wait for the pause as the player accepts the input (a small box next to R2-D2 will illuminate). Then press 3 and wait for the pause. Finally, press 8. \\"1138\\", get it?<br /><br />As for the pros and cons of altering the original films, I'll stay out of that debate. Just remember to play nice everybody... don't make me turn this car around! :)
0316168815|5.0|This book takes place in the early 1970's. It is a story about  14 year Susie Salmon and her life in heaven after she is murdered. So may parts of this book made me tear up, but you have such a good feeling when this book is over. You want to beleive that heaven is just like Susie explains it to be. A wonderful wonderful book....
B00000K3D4|5.0|I was in my teens, just like Sarah, when I first watched this movie. After that, I came back to it over and over again throughout these years.. I bought the VHS version, lost it; then the VCD, lost again.. I was so excited when I find it again on DVD!  <br /> <br />It's a girl's dream, to be that pretty princess loved by a handsome dark lord. Jim Henson was great, every muppet in there has its own character. They may looked ugly, but very kind. I still remember Sarah's conversation with the \\"helping hands\\", the little worm, etc. There were so much detail and meaning in the dialogues.  <br /> <br />The ending was cool too. Fairy tale's ending is predictable, it is the treatment that makes a different. A girl might decide to grow up, but there is always a dream deep inside. :) <br /> <br />Watch it carefully, you'll learn a lot. It is well worth it.

Words immortalized in what I thought was the king of all thrillers - \\"The Day of the Jackal\\".<br /><br />\\"Avenger\\" is much like his earlier work - maybe too much like it. Thats why I hit him one star down. For any other writer this would be 5 stars easily. With Forsyth, we expect much and Forsyth usually delivers.<br /><br />The pages will fly by. Each chapter merely whets your appetite for the next as the plot and the plans unfold.

He is hired to bring Zilic to justice to answer for his crimes. Zilic is hiding on a remote island with an army of bodyguards and protected by the local military dictator. Zilic also has a \\"guardian angel\\". Dexters work is cut out for him.<br /><br />We have a classic cat and mouse scenario. The bad guys know the Avenger is coming thanks to his guardian angel. Dexter must use every skill and trick learned as a Viet Nam \\"Tunnel Rat\\" to accomplish his mission and survive the encounter.<br /><br />I docked this book 1/2 star for making Dexter a little too smooth. Things maybe were a little easier than they should have been for him. The endless perfect passports for one thing stretched credibility just a little. I docked him another 1/2 star for maybe being a little too reminiscent of \\"Jackal\\".<br /><br />Make no mistake, this is the work of a master, and I can't imagine any thriller fan being disappointed with it. Those who have read Forsyth before will recognize his style, and maybe wish he had stretched himself just a little more. This book is not as good as \\"Jackal\\" in my opinion (which is sure to garner a few \\"not helpful\\" votes), but make no mistake this is an excellent book but I believe Forsyth to be capable of better.<br /><br />Read and enjoy.

B00005J6T0|5.0|In 1986 Madonna's third studio album was released. With the promotional song \\"Live to Tell\\" a new sense a maturtiy was seen in Madonna. Her voice had deepened (and she lost her resembelence to Minne Mouse) and her songs had a more \\"close to home\\" feel. After the success with \\"Live to Tell\\", next came one of the Material Girl's biggest hits ever, \\"Papa Don't Preach\\" an anti-abortion song that created somewhat a spark with some fans. Next the title Track was released, \\"True Blue\\" a teenage love song, with a catchy beat, made for one hell of a hit, but not enough to later make it to her first Greatest Hits album: The Immaculate Collection. The Fourth single to be released was \\"Open your Heart\\" another great song, that racked up success for Madonna. The final song to come from True Blue was \\"La Isla Bonita\\". This was Madonna's first stab at Musica de latina and this song gave Madonna her first #1 in Japan and another #1 in other Countries around the world.   The songs that did not make it to singles are still really great.  They Included \\"White Heat\\" a great song dedicated to Jimmy Cagney.  \\"Where's the Party\\" the dance anthem of True Blue, no Madonna cd would be complete without one.  \\"Jimmy, Jimmy\\" another love song that has a repitious sense  and Finaly \\"Love Makes the World Go 'Round\\" a song that discuses war and how we need to learn to love one another, \\"before it gets too late\\"  1986 proved to be one awesome year for Madonna, with her most successful Studio Album EVER.
0763624292|4.0|This CD has a lot of word play, lovely vocabulary (just like the book) and lots of instructions to follow. It is very participatory.    In short, it's not a terrific toddler CD. It's simply too complicated. I think a toddler might enjoy the CD if you played it while looking at the book together. (I'm planning on getting the book to find out.) But, don't count on being able to pop it into your car's CD to entertain your two year old... unless he or she is already enamored with the story.    Get this for a child  - Who is old enough to follow somewhat abstract instructions. For example, the CD asks kids to \\"Move your hands to show what the following words might look like. Over. Under. Back. Up the stairs...\\"  - Who has enough attention span to enjoy an oral story on it's own right  - Or, who is already very familiar with the story and loves it!
B00003CXCT|5.0|If all the Episodes are a long time ago, but are much more advanced than we, than why would Episodes IV-VI need to be revamped? The cycle that would make sense would be the first three would be the most technologically prevalent, than the next three would be right about at the level of the original, than the final 3 would be the one movie, THX 1138.  <br /> <br />I don't find the re-release offensive because I would have gone to see the original 3 at the theater anyway. The deleted scenes made for more excitement (even though they were not all that meaningful to me). We get to see a sneak peek of Episode III, which to me, is worth the price. This is the kind of movie that you can watch until next year and try to gain something new each time (i.e. CLERKS X).  <br /> <br />I look forward to buying this set and locking myself indoors for the following two months in awe. ROTJ will be memorized by Christmas! 8)

B000268QB2|4.0|I really did enjoy this album. I got free ticjets to a keane show in Kansas City and cant wait to see them, because they are band that saves its energy for the live performance. This band knows how to write music. Different from other British PoP-whatever... you may hear, who sound like they all get together one day and write in the same room listening to the same inspiration. This band will put out good albums in the future! Also one side note, one of their songs is featured on a victorias secret commercial.
B000001YOW|4.0|This was Porcupine Tree's first \\"band\\" album.  Earlier projects were mostly Steven Wilson solo.  The songs are melodic and cohesive with some of the rock edge that became so prominent on \\"In Absentia\\" several years later.  The lyrics don't always flow very well; this is an aspect of the music that improved greatly on later PTree projects.  Richard Barbieri's keyboards are a highlight.  Barbieri completely avoids the \\"many-notes\\" style of the various Dream Theater keyboardists (good in their own way) and instead uses very interesting analog synth textures and a keen ear for the perfect harmony accompaniment.  More than anything else, his playing gives these songs their distinct feel and elevates the music to something more special than the sum of its parts.   I couldn't disagree more strongly with the reviewer below who laments Barbieri not playing more notes.  He's entitled to his opinion . . . but he's wrong. <br />
B00005Y228|5.0|Fever- the cd that re-introduced Americans to Kylie Minogue. The album spwaned one hit after the other and got everyone singing \\"La, la, la\\". Here is what I think of Fever:<br /><br />1.More,more,more- An upbeat start to an upbeat album, although it is the song I listen to the least. It has a very disco feel to it.<br /><br />2. Love at First sight- a winner. Upbeat, happy. Great song.<br /><br />3. Can't get you out of my head- Again the song that got us hooked again. More than two years after it has been released and I still can't get it out of my head.<br /><br />4.Fever- The title track. I love it and it makes a great song to sing live.<br /><br />5.Give it to me- A lot of people's least favorite song, but I love it.Upbeat, short(the shortest on the cd,I believe), and I love the end.<br /><br />6.Fragile- One of the cds slower tracks. It took a while for this song to grow on me, but now I love it.My favorite line is, \\"Lie awake, toss and turn, am I the only one?\\"<br /><br />7.Come into my world-The song I listen to the most. Awesome song.<br /><br />8.In your eyes- I saw Kylie sing this song on \\"Saturday Night Live\\" and loved it immediately. Upbeat.<br /><br />9.Dancefloor-Not one of my favorites but it's still a good song. Upbeat.<br /><br />10.Love affair-slower and again one of my favorites.<br /><br />11.Your love- Slower, and a good song. I love the bridge.<br /><br />12.Burning up- the track that brings it home. Upbeat and simple. The chorus is just, \\"I'm burning up baby\\". Great song to end a great cd.<br /><br />\\"Fever\\" was my first Kylie cd and I love it. I have more than half of her nine cds and this is still the one I listen to the most. If you don't have it now, what are you waiting for?
B00004BZ0N|5.0|Pete Townsend once said [I'm paraphrasing] that punk wouldn't get far if it refused to acknowldge its past.  On this album, the Clash took up the challenge and came up aces.  Here, the Clash pays homage to their influences in ska, jazz, punk, blues, pop, and reggae without imitating them.  As usual, they pull it off with a combination of intelligence, humor and passion that was rare then and even more so now.    London Calling is one of the most important albums ever in rock.  To call it a \\"punk\\" album or a great 80's album is to diminish its scope.  This album easily ranks up there with the best of the Beatles and the Stones and continues to be far superior to the product that's available today.      If I could give it more than 5 stars I would.
B0001ZMWQO|3.0|I tried really hard not to like this album, and I must say that I found It much more interesting most other purchases I've made. I will not end this review without saying that some of it was really repetetive, but nonetheless a worthwhile purchase. \\"Take me out\\" and \\"Matinee\\" are good but the album offers much more than the radio will let you hear. Lets hope the come out with something else next year. <br />
B00005JLR8|5.0|That one-liner came from the Screaming Afro-American who played the key role of Mateo. He was one character who held the plot of the awesome healing acceptance, curious creativity shown by two Angelic Daughters, and wrenching grief or both Irish, Mother and Father! We sat straight thru the lengthy, emotionally draining story to comment...\\"This was heavy and emotional but definitely serves as excellent example of our other English, German/French, Italiano and African Families who settled IN America!\\"  <br /> <br />It called to mind: ROOTS; A TREE Grows In Brooklyn; CARUSO; and many others from the history of Music, Drama, Literature, even our Western culture of California. I would dearly love to give it more than 5 Stars! ...From an experienced reviewer, musician, and Retired Chaplain Fred W Hood
B0002DB52M|5.0|A LONG MOVIE BUT WITH A STRANGELY SATISFYING ENDING. ITS FASCINATING TO WATCH THE TOWNSPEOPLE AND GRACE EMBRACE AND THEN TURN ON EACH OTHER.  ALL THE ACTORS GIVE QUALITY PERFORMANCES.

0156027321|3.0|I find it utterly astonishing that over a thousand people would find this book interesting enough to comment on it. I find it even more astonishing that so many find this book praiseworthy.  <br /> <br />First, allow me to admit that I found the character, Pi, fascinating and well-realized. Would that I could make a similar claim for any of the other characters in this novel. <br /> <br />Second, though it tends to be a bit spare of physical details, I like Martel's prose.  <br /> <br />Third, the plot is interesting (if a bit slow to get started) and the dual-tales element in the last chapters is even quite clever.  <br /> <br />Beyond those points, this novel has some serious flaws. Other reviewers have mentioned this book's weak efforts at spiritual profundity, and I must concur. I was suspicious with of the author's claim (placed in the mouth of the first reporter of Pi's tale) that this story would make the recipient \\"believe in God,\\" and was annoyed to find absolutely nothing in the story to support the claim.  <br /> <br />Moreover, the author clearly wants the reader to identify with Pi's catholic religious attitudes. Pi is presented as both learned and open-minded (a biologist who studied comparative religion in college) and expends many words promoting his multi-sect religiosity. Ultimately, though, I found Pi to be open-minded to the point of spiritual gullibility. Pi comes across as one easily overawed, one who eagerly embraces ritual for its own sake. Pi sketches his tale of becoming a Christian, Muslim, and Hindu (simultaneously) and offers a bit of insight into what he finds interesting about Christianity. That insight seems to consist of little more than a fascination with Christ's willingness to suffer for love. Pi's love of Hinduism seems to be merely cultural, and he makes a broad generalization about how no one who learns about Islam can fail to fall in love with it. I find Pi's pronouncements about religion fatuous and presumptious. I find his conclusion that agnosticism is a failure of imagination merely insulting. <br /> <br />Is Pi's multifaceted religious experience and ability to survive (not just the physical but also the psychological ordeal--I don't want to be a spoiler) supposed to demonstrate the existence of Providence? Or perhaps Pi's apparent even-tempered, soulful openness--despite his harrowing ordeal--is supposed to convince us? I find myself asking a paraphrase Stephen Hawking's question at the end of \\"A Brief History of Time\\": where is the hand of Providence necessary in this tale? What does Pi survive that would have destroyed an atheist or agnostic and where is this point demonstrated? <br /> <br />A few other aspects of this book make it difficult for me to see it as a great work of literature. The story Martel tells could be pared down to about a hundred fifty pages with no real loss of information. The interjections of Martel talking with Patel, for example, add nothing but filler. Conversely, much more of Pi Patel's travails could be enriched with detail. I found the chapters summarizing the various skies and seas tedious and uninformative. I also found many of Martel's description of events vague and insubstantial (the sinking of the ship; the final landfall). <br /> <br />During Pi's interviews with the Japanese shipping executive, the assistant analyses the similarities between his two tales. This analysis is blatant and somewhat insulting. I'm sure most readers would have noticed the same similarities.
B00006CXSS|1.0|This is a show that combines WWII melodrama with modern teen-TV dramas to create a horrid mixture of bad acting and war-glorification.  It makes war look like a paid vacation with your buddies.  Also: it waaay overglorifies American soldiers, who were far from being the best soldiers in the war.  None of these characters/soldiers would have held up for 24 hrs. on the eastern front. <br /> <br />I was never given any reason to care about any of the characters.  Some were so cuddly \\"terry bear\\" ish that it was sickning.  This is a perfect example of America's isolation for the realities of the rest of the world and of war in general. <br /> <br />There is no real pathos or drama here, only blood and gut scenes and melodrama(much much more melodrama than B&Gs).  The story is very poorly written and tries to deal \\"sensitively\\" with too many different characters. <br /> <br />Makes you feel like war is something the Beverly Hills 90210 teens did on their spring break.
0385337388|1.0|I love reading and there have only been three novels in my life which I forced myself to read (the first was part of a book club so I had to read the book in its entirety to discuss with the group, the second one was loaned by a good friend who loved it so I gave it the benefit of the doubt but I did not complete it, and this one). <br /> <br />There seems to be a consensus in the book reviews for this book that if you're a resident and read this book, it is a sarcastic but realistic portrayal of life as an intern and if you're an outsider, it's disturbing.  I am an outsider and yes I did find it disturbing.  I don't doubt that it might reflect reality.  But the writing is poor, the character development non-existent and the plot nowhere to be seen.  In one book review, it stated the characters are great and really portray hospital life accurately.  In my opinion, this could not be further from the truth.  I kept waiting for the protagonist to share some of his inner thoughts - or just thoughts period, with the reader.  One sentence here and one there alluding that he may want to kill himself just doesn't cut it (no pun intended).  I patiently (again, no pun intended) but persistently plodded through the book waiting, expecting... giving it the benefit of the doubt, since the book was hailed as a classic and because I am interested (as much as an outsider can be) in the field of medicine/health.  But character development never came.  And this applies to all the characters.  Sure, it was interesting to learn about the BUFF and TURF and Gomers Don't Die which we read about in the beginning of the book, but to still talk about it one-third through the book, and then half way through the book, and then two-thirds through the book...  Just the same thing over and over again.  BUFF and TURF, BUFF and TURF, BUFF and TURF.  On and on and on... You call that insight!  Enough already!  I suggest the author keep his day job (MD).  <br />
0446677450|3.0|Here's the thing with this book. It's wildly popular, and maybe if I read the entire series I would be a bigger fan.  There's one central theme in this book: learn how your \\"stuff\\" can MAKE you money, not cost you money. That in itself is an important lesson to learn... <br /> <br />..but.. <br /> <br />The author discusses quite a bit of real estate topics, like how he bought this or that for pennies and then rents it out or sells it at a profit. Well the thing is, he mentions his first purchase was on a home that he quickly turned around and sold at a profit, however he purchased it by borrowing $5K from a friend (withthe intent of paying his buddy interest). Well that's great and all, but I don't have any friends who will lend me $5K, especially for my first real estate investment!  From that money the author was able to go forth and make more investments...so unless you have a chunk of change to buy property, or something who will lend it to you, then it's kind of hard to believe that you can get as rich as the author by buying real estate.
B0000JCFPE|5.0|Basic Instinct is an intelligent, lush, and ultimately pointless thriller. It says very little, if anything, about humanity. There is no moral lesson or altruistic \\"drama as teacher\\" plot to be found. That is, in fact, what makes it such a great movie! <br /> <br />The lush photography, the sizzling and controversial sex scenes, the huge, iconic performance by Sharon Stone, and a stunning, icy score all add up to a couple hours of pure, mind-bending excitement. It imposes nothing of a political or philosophical nature on the viewer--but acts as eye candy just for the sake of art.   <br /> <br />If you find the human body offensive, or sex, then do not watch this movie. If you want an intelligently written film that does not aspire to be a moral lesson, but is intelligent and captivating just the same, then do yourself a favor and take your mind on a holiday.  See what made Sharon Stone a '90s superstar. See Basic Instinct (and cross your fingers the proposed sequel will happen soon, with Stone and Ashton Kutcher.)
0767827902|5.0|Bogdanovich did his homework on this excellently directed movie about the decline of 'western' civilization. He ably directs the camera and his choice to shoot in Black & White demonstrate his ability to understand this medium's ability for longevity in the mind's eye. While it is true Bogdanovich regards Ford/Hawks/Welles as the best of all American directors, one should not be disappointed that he takes some of his visual cues from their canon (They ARE, after all, the BEST). ALL ART IS DERIVATIVE; to believe otherwise is quite simply childish & sophomoric thinking. This contemplative film stands the test of time, unlike the latest trend toward flashy editing techniques and computer generated graphics.
B000002UAF|5.0|This is such a great album.  The releases in the states covered at least 3 lps so it's wonderful to have them here all together as they should be.  The songs sound so effortless that it is astounding.  These aren't simple ditties, either.  If you listen to the chord structuring you soon realize that these guys were so far ahead of the pack of pop songwriters at that time it was ridiculous.  One thing really struck me, though.  Their extensive use of acoustic guitar on almost half of the songs was the beginning of a trend that would soon lead them to \\"Rubber Soul\\" and beyond.  This cd is a joy to listen to any time anywhere.
B00008BXJF|5.0|Having bought this only a week ago i can say these: KC (fripp/belew/gunn/mastelotto) gave their best album of the post-1994 period, and it seems that the \\"fractalization\\" period DID have a meaning. The sound is aggressive, crystal clear and deep, and the playing is amazing. In some tracks, it brings to mind the album \\"Starless & Bible Black\\", though with a more textured approach. There are less improvisations than in other albums. They use plenty of electronic drums which is refreshing, and they do it pretty maturely. The songs are amazingly good, no fillers. The overall feeling is superior and more cohesive to that of THRAK. To my ears this stuff is combining heavy experimentalism and accesibility which is what art is all about.  Bravo mr. fripp/belew/gunn/mastelotto  Have a nice day
B00008LDPU|5.0|The Animatrix is an interesting work.It features nine anime shorts that are wonderfully animated. The shorts are as follows: <br /> <br />Final Flight of the Osiris:As mentioned in Reloaded,this is about the ship The Osiris and its crew who find out the sentinels,the squid-looking machines,are digging towards Zion and now the crew must try to reach Zion before the machines do in this wonderful CG animated short from the makers of Final Fantasy.The second best of the set. <br /> <br />The Second Renaissance parts I and II:This story,separated into two parts,is the story of how the war started beween the humans and the machines.This movie explains how the humans blackened the sky,how the machines rose to power,why all the cities were destroyed,etc.But be warned,this is a very graphic and distrubing work,so I wouldn't recomened this for the very young.Still,in my opinion,this is the best of the set because it explains how everything started. <br /> <br />Kid's Story:Remember the Kid who from Reloaded and Revolutions who said Neo saved him? Well,this is his story.It explains how he met Neo and how he escaped the Matrix and got into the real world.Due to the fact it has a image of an imparent teen suicide,this is also not a good one for the very young.However,if you liked the kid for the matrix sequals(you learn his actual name in this),then this is a good one to check out. <br /> <br />Program:This is a short about a woman who is training in the Matrix when a fellow member of her crew tells her he wants to go back to the Matrix and wants her to come with him.She responds with no and a violent fight ensures.This one has some good action and a good story.Definently one of the best!!! <br /> <br />World Record:Certainly the worst of the shorts,this is about a man deternined to break a world record in track and ends up escaping the Matrix for a couple of seconds.Very confusing and somewhat dumb,it is good to watch once,then never watch it again. <br /> <br />Beyond:This isabout a girl who loses her cat and ends up at a house that kids play at.The house has a glitch in it,allowing the kids to defy gravity.But soon,the agents find out.Overall,a good but disappointing short which is kinda enjoyable. <br /> <br />A Detective Story:A detective,who wants to leave the profession,gets a call from a mysterious person to find and capture Trinity.He gets on a train and meets her,which leads to a encounter with agents.Better than Beyond and World Record,Detective Story is a well done short that will please fans. <br /> <br />Matriculated:The last of the shorts,this is about a crew which capture one of the machines and take it inside the Matrix.This one doesn't make much sense,but has some good animation and action scenes.Still,I think this one will take multiple viewings to really understand it. <br /> <br />I hope my review was helpful.This is worth checking out,especially Final Flight and The Second Renaissance.But or rent today.
B000060OMU|5.0|Okay, so Ray Brown? Rocks. Ray Brown with two other string bass players? Totally rocks. Ray Brown with two other string bass players who happen to be Christian McBride and John Clayton? Well, then, you've got some KICKIN' jazz.  <br /> <br />Note: I think I heard a track from this CD several years ago on my local jazz station. It took me long enough to track the darn thing down, but now I can't stop listening to it. I give it my highest compliment, which is: now that's good stuff.
B000002UB6|5.0|Yes, Let It Be... Naked was released recently, but when I say it was their last CD I simply mean it was the last album The Beatles released when they were still a group. Although I have to agree with the reviewer who writes that this does feel like their last album, Let It Be must never be trivialized nor put down. The album (here on CD, of course) contains some very special songs such as \\"Across The Universe,\\" \\"I Me Mine,\\" \\"The Long and Winding Road,\\" and \\"Get Back.\\" There are wonderful photos of the band members although the liner notes are lacking. The quality of the sound is excellent; it's very ironic that their last released album ends with the hope that the group \\"passed the audition.\\" The dubbing effects on \\"Across the Universe\\" are well done in my opinion.<br /><br />I can't see any reason to avoid buying this album on CD. It is an absolute must for any Beatles fan and a superb collection of recordings done in the group's final days together.
B0000CCZ3A|1.0|This is what Sting would sound like if he were born in Arkansas. Simply put, Yankee Hotel Foxtrot is awful. I should have steered clear when I started seeing comparisons to Radiohead, but I was suckered by the positive reviews. Once upon a time, alternative music, and alt-country especially, could be relied on for simple pleasures, and at some point things would start to rock. No more. Lyrics are almost unrelentingly morose, melodies are virtually non-existent, and you get the feeling that no one enjoyed making this music, nor do they want you to enjoy listening to it. We have gone from No Depression to All Depression. Jay Bennett didn't leave the band because of this music. He lapsed into a boredom-induced coma while listening to the tapes and is still asleep under a desk somewhere. I beg you... don't encourage these people. Go buy a used Bottle Rockets CD instead.    Hey!  I just found out that Wilco was sued for using the \\"Yankee Hotel Foxtrot\\" soundbite without permission.  As a result, they had to fork over a large sum of money to the owner.  So, something good came out of this dreck after all - kinda like finding a quarter at the bottom of a portajon.  The soundbite is from a 4CD collection called \\"The CONET Project.\\"  The discs consist of recordings of short wave \\"number stations\\" - mechanical voices repeating numbers to no discernible purpose.  It's a great collection, and a million times more interesting than this disc.
0812550706|1.0|This book is amazingly bad. It has every single trait of a bad book, it is: <br /> <br />A: Repetitive <br />B: Boring <br />C: Long <br />D: Depressing <br /> <br />The book is about a genius 6 year old cadet in military school where everyone is violent and evil and wants to injure or kill everyone else. His brother (who is only slightly older than he is) is homicidal. This is a very popular book, but I sincerely and absolutely hated it. <br /> <br /> <br />(In fairness to the book, however I did not finish it. I only read half because I was so bored with it I stopped.)
B00009V8Z9|5.0|First of all, I would just like to say that there are not too many artists that I could hear just one song and go out to buy the CD.  After I heard the song, \\"Just Friends\\", I was completely hooked.  This entire album has many songs for every different type of person.  There is not one song that I skip, whenever I'm in a bad mood, I listen to it, whenever I'm in a good mood, I listen to it.  His voice is just so hypnotic and you can really relate to his lyrics.  If I had to pick one CD to live with for the rest of my life, this would definitely have to be it.
B0000640VO|3.0|Amelie is so French.  Paris is so beautiful.  Is it really that lovely?  I don't think Goddard thought it was.  The great French director, Renoir, well he saw the disastrous 30's as a parable of misery.  And I was dodging Paris con men and not dodging prostitutes in the early 70's, but Amelie will have none of that cynicism.  No Socialist French nightmare of unbelievable unemployment and crappy free, healthcare for the young woman, Amelie.  She's in a fantasy world.      I loved the warm colors of 19th century painter Renoir.  This is a movie that is a canvas-a-scene.  The dialogue is quirky; the scenes go by fade in, fade out, little odd twists and turns.  Fantasy animation scenes intermingle with romantic notions.  Love wins out for most while the foolish and mean come to see their way.  If only...
B000002H6C|5.0|Okay,it's never easy to write a review about a album such as this,but i'm gonna try.I've been a metallica fan for about 2 years.I have all their albums.This is definitely Metallica's best.Every song has a totally unique,original sound.And every song is interesting.Example:On the \\"Puppets\\" album,after ORION follows Damage inc.i don't think I've ever listened to it completely.Unlike this album.Every song has 'something',whether it's the chorus,main riff,vocals,drums,solo etc.that draws you to it.The complicated song structures make the album a challenge to learn how to play on every instrument,especially guitar(which i play).I am so fascinated with this album that I cannot find the words to describe it's perection.Hetfield's vocals sound awesome.His voice is angry,agressive and hungry for justce.Hammet again shows his skills as a masterful guitar player by playing some of his greatest solos ever on this album.Lars is f.....g crazy on this album.Just listen to 'Harvester of sorrow','Justice for all','One' & and especially 'Dyers eve'.Simply amazing.Jason's bass lines are tuned down  way too low,which doesn't let him prove himself.But wait.While listening to this album,just turn down the volume and then you will hear perfect bass(low freq.sound). <br />The tracks are: <br />1.Blackened 10/10 <br />2...And justice for all 10/10 <br />3.Eye of the beholder 9.7/10 <br />4.One ??????/10 <br />5.The shortest straw 10/10 <br />6.Harvester of sorrow 10/10 <br />7.The frayed ends of sanity 9.5/10 <br />8.To live is to die  11/10 <br />9.Dyers eve 10/10 <br /> <br />Need I say more about this album.It's the best Metallica album and one of the best metal albums ever,if not the best.It takes some time to get used to the songs because they are very complicated,but when you do...you'll see what I was talking about.In short,this album is a MUST-HAVE!!!BUY IT NOW AND ENJOY THE BEST MUSIC EVER!!!!!
0671027387|2.0|Dan Brown's books are fast paced stories, but like Digital Fortress, Deception Point involves brilliant described who don't act brilliant.  How can so many preeminent scientists be duped so easily.  Also the Kiowa Warrior which destroyed the car and attacked the boat simply does not have the capabilities described.  And even Delta Force couldn't fire a helfire missile in Washington DC without being tracked and shot down.  As a helicopter pilot it annoys me when authors get the details so wrong.
B0002IQHY8|2.0|I really wanted to like this record. I have been an Alan Parsons fan since 1977, when I discovered \\"I Robot\\". I have purchased every Alan Parsons Project / Alan Parsons recording since then, and I have to say that \\"A Valid Path\\" is a huge disappointment. I understand that artists like to \\"stir the pot\\" from time to time and try some new musical forms and collaborations, but this recording has no sense of where it wants to go. We have two attempts at alternative rock that are totally unrecognizable as Alan Parsons (\\"More Lost Without You\\" and \\"You Can Run\\"), two re-hashed tracks from prior albums with nothing particulatly different or interesting about them (\\"Mannagamma `04\\" and \\"A Recurring Dream Within A Dream\\"), three long, boring, monotonous tracks that sound like synths on autopilot (\\"Return to Trunguska\\", \\"Tijuaniac\\", and \\"Chomolungma\\") and two remaining listenable songs (\\"We Play the Game\\" and \\"L'Arc En Ciel\\"). Those two songs are enough to pull this review up to two stars. Given this artist's history, I will forgive this bad record one and hope for better projects in the future.
0312995423|3.0|I enjoyed the story and as usual Dan Brown's books are easy and fun to read but the whole time I was thinking that Susan Fletcher was no super genius because she acted like a dumb blonde.
B0002F7I9Y|3.0|At first glance, \\"Genius Loves Company\\" seems as though it would be the perfect album. Where else can you find such illustrious performers all packed into one album? Well it's not all that it would seem to be. <br /> <br />Let me start by saying that every song on the album is great, but with that said, let me point out the flaws. Some songs duets would have been great if only they were singing the right song. For example, Willie Nelson is a great performer and a great musician, but when it comes to his voice, let's just say he's not the best. So when I hear him perform \\"It Was a Very Good Year\\" which relies a great deal on vocal talent to carry the song, it's quite disappointing. And although I love Elton John and Van Morrison, their performances seem to be lacking in my opinion. <br /> <br />Don't get me wrong, there are many good tracks on the album as well, such as \\"Sweet Potato Pie\\" with James Taylor and my personal favorite \\"Fever\\" with Natalie Cole. In the end \\"Genius Loves Company\\" seems to be nothing more than a novelty, but it's a novelty that I would still recommend purchasing.
B00005YUPO|5.0|So I bought into the baby einstein hype, I bought her the play mat, some toys but had never got a dvd. Frankly I was against the idea of putting my baby infront of the tv until she could at least sit on her own.  <br />Well that happened so I decided to get her a DVD. I bought this one but I am SO happy I did not pay this much for it.  <br />First off I have to say my daughter likes it. Why she does, I cant understand. Its a low production quality DVD with the most cheap looking \\"puppets\\" you can imagine. I really couldnt believe that this is what everyone had been so excited over. These are toys set to classical music. The music isnt even real instruments its synthesized and cheap sounding.  <br />I had been playing her classical music since I was pregnant and I love it myself. But this is so cheap sounding.  <br />Anyway it really doesnt matter what I think, its not for me. She likes it and is completely enthralled.  <br />We also have mozart, neighborhood animals, world animals and van gogh. The van gogh is BY FAR THE BEST out of those I have listed. <br />But if you would rather not spend this much on it Ill tell you a secret. You can get it at an online auction website for a package of 10-15 brand new for 35.00. Dont spend the money here its too much for what your getting. Gotoebay and get it there.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Wow! Britney's album, \\"In the Zone\\" is simply amazing! It is totally different from anything Britney has ever done, but yet die hard Britney fans are still going to love it! This album really showcases Britney's songwriting and her new perspectives on life....in other words Britney is all grown up! <br />1. Me Against the Music- If you love this song, you will like the album. Such a fun song to dance to! Dance off anyone? <br />2. I Got That Boom Boom- Awesome beat!  <br />3. Showdown- A bit slower than some of the other songs, but still has a great beat.  <br />4. Breathe on Me- My favourite song on the album. I think it is worth buying for this song alone. <br />5. Early Mornin'- In Rolling Stone Magazine Britney said this was her favourite song on the album. It's a fun song with an awesome groove. Moby co-wrote and produced it. <br />6. Toxic- This song has a James Bond vibe to it. I love the chorus. <br />7. Outrageous- This song would be great to dance to but I think it is one of the weaker songs on the album. It was written and produced by R Kelly. <br />8. Touch of My Song- This is song is the most sexual on the album. But hey- you gotta give the girl some credit for putting such a forward song on her album. The song does have a cool Eastern vibe to it. <br />9. The Hook Up- Good dancing song with a touch of reggae. Kind of reminds me of Gwen Stefani. <br />10. Shadow- This is my least favourite song on the album. It is quite slow and just kind of boring. <br />11. Brave New Girl- Britney does Madonna proud with Brave New Girl. In fact I could swear Madonna is singing the bridge! Funky song. <br />12. Everytime- Another slow song, but this one is beautiful. I think this song really demonstrates what an amazing song writer Britney can be. It is a really touching song. <br />13. Me Against the Music Remix- So fun! Just as good as the original and even better to dance to!  <br />Overall Britney did a stand up job on her new album. While there is trace of classicBritney songs, her new style has class, talent and groove. Any Briney fan will love this album and if you aren't a Britney fan you should give it a try. I think Miss Spears will surprise you! <br /> <br />
B0002VEXUA|5.0|this dvd is excellent for any oasis fan.  loads of interviews, live stuff, and hidden extras.  more oasis than you can shake a stick at! <br /> <br />this dvd looks back at the making of the greatest debut album in history.  it reminds you why you love them, and gives you a little insight into how it all started.   <br /> <br />i can't say enough about this dvd.  if you like oasis, britpop, rockumentaries, or mancunian accents; this is the dvd for you!
B00005OM4N|5.0|(1) I'M A SLAVE 4 U - No doubt we've heard this sexy and breathy slice of pop that certainly changed Spears's style, and whilst one of the standout tunes on the album, this type of sound isn't the basis of the album. <br /> <br />(2) OVERPROTECTED - This is a more familiar Britney sound and she funks things up a little in this pop classic. Has a little *Nsync feel to it. <br /> <br />(3) LONELY - One of the tracks Spears co-wrote, this is a sexy, aggressive R&B based pop tune that has one hell of a catchy chorus and proves how much of a credible writer she is. Definitely a must listen to song. <br /> <br />(4) NOT A GIRL, NOT YET A WOMAN - The album's signature ballad, and theme song to her film \\"Crossroads\\", is this goregeous number co-written by Max Martin and UK singer Dido. Spears' voice sounds incredible.  <br /> <br />(5) BOYS - Said to be one of Britney's personal faves, this takes a few listens to get used to. Produced by The Neptunes, who also did \\"Slave 4 U\\", it features more of Britney's breathy vocals. Defintitely a different kind of song. <br /> <br />(6) ANTICIPATING - Another one of Britney's writing efforts is this cute Janet Jackson style, early Kylie sounding, pop tune that is pure fun to listen to. Shows she hasn't lost her pop roots completely. <br /> <br />(7) I LOVE ROCK \\"N\\" ROLL - Hit R&B writer/producer Rodney Jerkins (Jennifer Lopez, Destiny's Child, Brandy) teams up once again with Spears for the cover of this classic rock track. Whilst their last collaboration funked up the Stones' \\"I Cant Get No Satisfaction\\", this time around they are staying very much close to the original content and Spears' voice suits it perfectly.  <br /> <br />(8) CINDERELLA - Another Britney writing effort is this fast paced pop tune, that keeps the pride of \\"Oops\\" alive. Funky track. <br /> <br />(9) LET ME BE - Urban style pop tune is a standout. Spears co-wrote this funky, and short, pop track that highlights the change of direction to a more R&B setting. Is also featured on the soundtrack to \\"On The Line\\". <br /> <br />(10) BOMBASTIC LOVE - Not a duet with Shaggy and not a hint of reggae pop anyway. This is another urban style pop tune that is instantly likeable, has a catchy chorus and a bit of a Pink feel to it. <br /> <br />(11) THAT'S WHERE YOU TAKE ME - Cute, catchy pop track mixes balladry and dance. Her voice is so cute and this is another instantly likeable tune that should appeal to her younger audiences. <br /> <br />(12) WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE ME - Co-written by Britney's choreographer Wade Robson and Justin Timberlake, this was a highly anticipated track that lives up to it's expectations. Agressive vocals over a funky backbeat, and Timberlake's beatbox, make this an album standout. Timberlake also provides backing vocals. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
0671004107|5.0|This book was very enjoyable.  It very realisticly explains how contact may someday be made. It touches on politics, science, religion and sexism. I highly recomend this book to everyone.

078322799X|5.0|Practically bashed by critics everywhere when released in 1996, the Frighteners can be appreciated today as an underrated gem.  After crafting a landmark gorefest with Dead Alive and scoring a hit among critics with Heavenly Creatures, future Lord of the Rings trilogy director Peter Jackson directed this wildly inventive and surprisingly innovative film starring Michael J. Fox as a psychic investigator who, with the help of three ghost pals, runs a phony ghost busting business.  Soon enough, people are getting picked off by Death himself, and it's up to Fox to find out what's really going on.  So much is going on in the Frighteners that it's easy for the film to become incoherent, but it's exciting visuals and special effects, along with the performance of Fox and the energetic direction of Jackson, make this film a surprise gem that should be (and very well may be) a cult classic.  The rest of the cast includes R. Lee Ermy, Jake Busey, and genre stalwart Jeffrey \\"Re-Animator\\" Combs.
B00005YUAC|5.0|A not-overly-auspicious beginning for Camel; fairly derivative and unadventurous though not without a certain E-for-effort charm.  Compared to its contemporaries, though, it sounds pretty uninspired, which it obvously was not - - sort of a cross between early Santana and King Crimson without the technical prowess of either, and it looks better in print than it sounds.  The tepid playing isn't helped much by the languid (and, on 'Mystic Queen', flanged) vocals and the lyrics are just plain awful.  It's evident even this early that Camel were more intentionally an instrumentally-inclined outfit and at this point had not yet found their collective muse.  This reissue includes, however, the live (instrumental!) 'Homage To The God Of Light' an earlier version of which was originally released as one side of the double-LP GREASY TRUCKERS LIVE AT DINGWALL'S DANCEHALL (the other sides featuring Gong, Henry Cow and The Global Village Trucking Company; seek it out).  Talk about inspired - - maybe they should have recorded their first album live.
0393035158|1.0|In The End of Faith, author Sam Harris presents all theistic religion as indefensible adherence to silly, untenable and ancient superstitions. He posits that fundamental discipleship to these religions - namely Christianity, Judaism and Islam - will inevitably lead to ever increasing world conflict in an age of weapons of mass destruction and unfettered transportation.<br /><br />Mr. Harris suggests that Islam may be the most dangerous of the three monotheistic religions as it counts greater numbers of true fundamentalists in its discipleship. Indeed, Mr. Harris devotes chapters to Islam and Christianity in his polemic. The chapter referring to Islam takes on current danger while the chapter on Christianity discusses the horrors inflicted on \\"heretics\\" in pre-Reformation times. Interestingly, although Mr. Harris does not directly address Judaism, all references to scripture are Old Testament - he conveniently misses the message of the New testament gospel. Christianity is now a less significant terror to Mr. Harris, as Christians have adopted a more moderate and pluralistic orientation. However, Mr. Harris counts this as also dangerous as moderation in monotheism only, in his opinion, leads to tolerance of other fundamentalisms and therefore allows the spread of radical fundamental monotheistic Islam.<br /><br />Following Mr. Harris's argument further, we learn that monotheism is fully the \\"root of all evil\\" as it is only through the invocation of the moral stance of, say Christianity, that laws are written to prohibit a more progressive and permissive social agenda.  fermenting all known unrest: wars, gang violence, interpersonal aggression, and the like. Further, the strict adherence to Christian morality denies the \\"truth\\" of modern secular humanism. It is interesting Mr. Harris does not recognize the religious fundamentalism inherent in secular humanism.<br /><br />Mr. Harris does recognize the human longing for spirituality. To replace monotheism, he suggests adoption of eastern mysticism and suggests how this will benefit the human condition. To replace morality, Mr. Harris suggests adoption of a striving for happiness. Here, his ponderous tome drifts into meaninglessness.<br /><br />The author writes in a style stilted and pedantic. It is clear he talks down to his readership to properly impress and instruct. He uses outside citations so often one wonders if he has an original thought. His arguments are often circular - he requires us to accept his posture only because he already has.<br /><br />I, for one, did not appreciate the lecture...ests adoption of eastern mysticism and suggests how this will benefit the human condition.

1592400876|5.0|_Eats, Shoots & Leaves_ is delightful -- and it seems to have drawn an audience far beyond the \\"sticklers,\\" the \\"punctuation vigilantes,\\" for whom it was originally written. <br /> <br />The voice of author Lynne Truss resounds on every page -- lively, witty, unmistakably British. (I'm grateful that she acknowledges that always tucking commas and periods inside closing quotation marks is an American convention. Even so, having an abundance of examples to the contrary in an authoritative volume such as this will almost certainly increase the threat to a sorely endangered punctuation rule.) <br /> <br />Truss recognizes punctuation marks -- beginning with the overburdened apostrophe -- as living entities. They were created centuries ago by printers, and their roles are constantly evolving. <br /> <br />Truss explains correct (and incorrect) uses of punctuation marks, even venturing into \\"murky\\" areas and interpreting differences of meaning that occur with the addition of an optional comma. _Eats, Shoots & Leaves_ is not primarily a punctuation handbook, however. <br /> <br />In addition to Truss's wit, one of the things I like best about her book is the history it includes: the origin of punctuation marks, excerpts from famous writers' essays on punctuation, illustrations of punctuation use from literature of previous centuries. Truss includes an extensive bibliography for readers who want to venture further into the realm of punctuation. <br /> <br />As Lynne Truss says, \\"If there is one lesson to be learned from this book, it is that there is never a dull moment in the world of punctuation.\\" And that is a lesson that most of the world can well stand to learn.
B0002F7I9Y|5.0|Ray Charles truly gave back to the world of music.  In his last album, a series of duets, aptly titled \\"Genius Loves Company\\", Charles and his collaborators give us that eclectic mix of styles he was known for.<br /><br />There are a couple of tracks, recorded early in 2004, when Ray was ill, where his voice and manner are notably subdued.  There are three miscalculations of the choice of songs that he made with his collaborator.  There are the inevitable difficulties of harmonizing with Ray -- (a man who had a knack for never singing a song the way you expect someone to), and those come through in some of the duets, although most feature echo singing and response, and little harmony.<br /><br />What a thrill to be asked to work with Ray on one of his previous hits....Gladys Knight is his featured partner in his gospel classic, \\"Heaven Help Us All\\".  Backed by a choir, Ray and Gladys mix richly.  Ray has several blues cuts on the CD -- the best of these is \\"Sinner's Prayer\\" with BB King.  Ray jams on the piano and BB gives Lucille a workout, with some background Hammond B3 by the legendary Billy Preston.  Ray and BB have a natural mix on one of Ray's oldest songs.  Some close harmony in the country blues cut \\"Do I Ever Cross Your Mind?\\" shines through in the featured song with Bonnie Raitt -- produced by Phil Ramone, it is a great mix of vocals and blues guitar.  Ray first did the song at the beginning of his career.  There's a changeup from country in the old Eddy Arnold standard, \\"You Don't Know Me\\" with Ray and Diana Krall.  Ray first did it in 1962, and the song is made richer with the jazzy counterpoint of Krall's flawless voice--another contribution from Phil Ramone.  And starting the album, Ray collaborates with a relative newcomer, Norah Jones, in his 1967 blues hit - \\"Here We Go Again\\".  The song is strong throughout, but fades a bit at the end where Ray and Norah struggle trying to mix harmony.  Preston's contribution on the Hammond B3 is flawless in this collaboration.<br /><br />Even better than being asked to work with Ray on one of his own songs is the honor of having Ray want to sing one of yours in a duet.  Ray introduced and inducted masterful songwriter Van Morrison into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in the summer of 2003, and their resulting duet, to Morrison's \\"Crazy Love\\" (from his amazing album, \\"Moondance\\") kick started the whole duet album concept.  It is the only live performance on the CD, and it amazes in that Morrison completely changes his approach to the song given the way that Ray begins it.  A flawless exercise (again, with Ramone producing) in musicianship!<br /><br />Another pop icon, Elton John, contributed the last song recorded, and the one where Ray's voice is the most feeble, but yet haunting.  True to form, his lead in the song gives Elton John an opportunity to sing his part in a completely different manner than his original recording.  The song is silk, with a full string accompaniment and a brooding, sultry feel that is perfect for both.<br /><br />The third artist who contributed a song and a duet is the wonderful James Taylor.  I've never been a fan of his ditty, \\"Sweet Potato Pie\\", and although it seems a logical choice for he and Ray -- it is one of only three \\"passable\\" songs.<br /><br />The other two songs that didn't quite cut it?  Both are classics, and in both, Ray works with another genius.  Unfortunately, both songs are overproduced and the mix of styles and voices doesn't work well.  With Johnny Mathis in \\"Over the Rainbow\\" -- Ray can't get Johnny to leave the standard melody and presentation of the old song.  Ray's bluesy counterpoint doesn't blend well, and the song is regrettably, just ordinary. One can't help but contrast it to the amazing Eva Cassidy version of the same song.  Perhaps the weakest duet on the album is a contrast in style and song, with Willie Nelson on the Sinatra standard, \\"It Was A Very Good Year\\".  In an overblown, orchestra-laden approach, arrangerVictor Vanacore leaves you feeling the production had nothing to do with the singers....it was a la Sinatra.  Either Ray or Willie could have done a credibly different version of the song as a solo, but together, the mix didn't work.<br /><br />One of Ray's favorite songs was a 60's pop tune called \\"Hey Girl\\"...wisely, he performs with a king of blue-eyed soul, Michael McDonald.  Strangely, Ray takes the high part, and McDonald, known for his incredible range in the high register, gets to exercise his lower range, although at one point, he lets his pipes fly.  With a full power orchestra, this song works, and the playful, tongue in cheek way in which Ray approaches it, makes it a highlight.<br /><br />But, saving the best for last, the only real jazz combination on the CD is Ray's duet with Natalie Cole on the classic, \\"Fever\\".  They are smooth as velvet and in perfect combination on the song.  \\"Fever\\" is known as a jazz torch song for a woman, but somehow, this duet, more playful and and unique than any version I've heard, is my favorite of all the songs on the CD.<br /><br />So, 9 great collaborations, and some exceptional liner notes and photos of Ray's last days ...far away offset a few of the lesser notes on this, the last effort of one of the finest performers of the last century.<br /><br />Buy, enjoy.approach, arranger Victor Vanacore leaves you feeling the production had nothing to do with the singers....it was a la Sinatra.

0316168815|4.0|Lovely Bones is an interesting theory on life after death, and is told through the eyes of Susie Salmon. Brutally raped and murdered by a close neighbour at 14, Susie watches her family from her heaven, as they continue to live on earth. Lovely Bones is completely original, and in it's delivery speaks as an authentic, naive, inexperienced teenager. Through Susie's regular interactions with those closest to her, Susie learns that it is not only her family which must learn to move on after her death - but she must let go of her life on earth. Lovely Bones is a very honest, unbiased glimpse into the  emotions caused by Susie's death. It confronts the changes in people, and the need to accept, move on - but never forget.<br /><br />A must read for anyone who has lost someone dear to them, or for anyone interested in an original concept and writing style. Lovely Bones was a pleasure to read - brought many a tear to my eye, both in sadness and in joy.
B000024D4R|5.0|daaamn i cant believe no one rated this album yet.  Thats crazy.  Its been out for mad long and its such a good album.  I heard it recently and i was speachless.

B000001ABD|5.0|This double CD was my introduction to the cross section of the many hits recorded by the great, prolific, multi-talented performer Stevie Wonder.  I love every track!  I have listened to this album so often that I think I practically wore a hole in the first CD.<br /><br />The songs that get the party started are actually some of his more recent hits from the 1980s and the 1970s.  Though, \\"Part-Time Lover\\" and \\"I Just Called To Say I Love You\\" don't showcase his signature harmonica riffs, they are still wonderful songs that are truly a part of a lot of people's repertoire (whether in karaoke, on the radio or in their memories), and definitely catchy.  I also love the romantic side of CD that is showcased on #1.  \\"Overjoyed,\\" \\"Ribbon in the Sky\\" and \\"Lately\\" are so tender and full of vulnerablity and intimacy.  For the more funky side of Stevie, check out the very catchy ten minute plus \\"Do I Do\\" featuring Dizzy Gilespie.<br /><br />CD#2 doesn't fail to disappoint.  \\"Send One Your Love\\" makes you want to grab your loved one and dance the night away, \\"Ebony and Ivory\\" is a great heartfelt duet with Paul McCartney and the list goes on and on...<br /><br />Enjoy!
0446677450|5.0|I just graduated from college last spring and was looking for opportunities. With a major in business management, I was seeking a entry job witht he possibility of moving up. <br /> <br />A friend recommended Rich Dad Poor Dad. I have to admit, I hated this book at first and thought it was childish. The information went against everything that I had been taught by mentors, friends, relatives, teachers and college professors. <br /> <br />Then I met a guy who had spent 25 years in the corporate world working his way up. He called it \\"the rat race\\" and said he felt like a rat. He told me that if he had it to do all over again, we would have started his own business and gone on his own. He then advised me to read and devour Rich Dad Poor Dad and suggested that I start my own business instead of working for someone else. <br /> <br />But I needed income! I had college loans to pay off and was moving into an apartment. He advised me to take a job as a temporary souorce of income and to learn. He reminded me what Rich Dad taught RTK, to get a job for what I could learn and forget about the pay. <br /> <br />He also suggested that I buy a affordable home in lieu of renting an apartment. He went on to tell me that he wasted a lot of time and money renting when he could have bought a home knowing what he knows no. He also reminded me of what Rich Dad teaches that a home is not an asset so to be conservative. Owning is still better than renting. He then suggested that I get into the rental property investment business which he had started a few years ago. He looked up in the air and said \\"If only I would have done this when I was your age!\\"  <br /> <br />He recomended some other books as well such as Think and Grow Rich, The Richest Man in Bablyon, Nothing Down, More Wealth Without Risk and a few others. <br /> <br />These books seemed like \\"feel good\\" books or get rich quick schemes. He told me that was what he used to think untill he read them and used the material. Like Rich Dad Poor Dad, only a certain group of people would be attracted to these books and actually use them and those people were the most successful. <br /> <br />So I followed my new friends advice. I took a job for what I could learn from it and to provide some cash flow untill I got my own deal going. In the evenings I allotted some time to looking for rental properties and checking out business opportunities. Before going to sleep at night and first thing in the morning I would read 1-2 hours of the books recommended like Rich Dad Poor Dad and Think and Grow Rich. <br /> <br />To date I have bought three properties and started a small home based business. My real estate property is generating positive cash flow and my business is generating a nice extra income and some really great tax deductions. <br /> <br />This new college grad is looking forward to becoming financially free at a very young age. This book was like a revelation to me and I highly recommend it - especially to new college grads like me and forget what those college profs taught you. How many of them looked wealthy and happy?  <br /> <br />
B0002I831S|5.0|What do you mean... the new first-season DVD set of Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season of 29 episodes... is finally available?  I used to cringe when the Enterprise crew members's red shirts looked fluorescent on TV reruns.  These episodes have never looked or sounded this good without commercial interruptions.<br /><br />I'm not disappointed that \\"The Cage\\" was omitted from this set.  The actors were different in the pilot and Kirk, Bones, and Scotty are missing.  Worst of all, Spock smiles in one scene.  Although the original cast argued off screen and their acting abilites were questionable in other roles, Roddenberry's production made them one of the best acting ensembles on television.<br /><br />The William Shatner Bobblehead is Available at Priceline!
B00005JMUA|5.0|Once you get past the first movie you will be impressed with the character and story development in this movie. I was impressed how much we learn and the tactics they use to get back at those they hate. Where the first Kill Bill is just bloody fighting and killing this movie is much more subtle. It certainly has fighting and killing, just not as much.<br /><br />Tarantino went for real character development and he does an outstanding job. When I saw the first Kill Bill I was a bit disappointed in all the outragious killing. When a friend suggested I see the second, I was glad I did. It not only impressed me with the overall story, but with the characters as well. To fully appreciate both movies you must see Kill Bill 2. The music is great in this movie. It reminded me of Spaghetti Westerns, Marshal Arts, and action movies. Great sets as well and the directing is first class.<br /><br />Amazing story of pursuit and final revenge. You follow the bride around the world as she is in pursuit. She recalls her visit to Asia and her instruction in marshal arts. A masters training and a sword play key roles in the stories development. This movie is almost like mixing \\"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\\" with \\"The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly\\" I highly recommend this movie, it stands on its own and could be viewed with or without the first movie.
0156027321|5.0|Please don't be deterred by the reviews of the people who never got all the way through the book.  Yes, it's a little slow in the beginning, but it picks up.  Don't listen to the people who say it was a lame story about a kid in a boat with a bunch of animals.  Obviously they never got through it either or totally missed the ending.  I read this book months ago, and I am still moved to tears if I sit and think about it too long.  For those of you who have not read the book, you should probably stop now as I might ruin it here for you.  <br /> <br />The end of the book reveals that Pi (probably) was not on a boat full of animals after all (ah, we thought that might be the case).  The alternate story that he offers is, in fact, so awful that if it IS true, then you realize that the only way he could keep himself sane and alive was to create an alternate reality for himself.  Once you grasp what the 2 possible realities are, you ache with your entire soul for the zebra,the hyena, the orangutan and Richard Parker to be real.  This is the first book in 20 years that has made me sob.  (The first was \\"Where the Red Fern Grows\\" when I was in 4th grade.) <br /> <br />If you didn't get all the way through the book, or if you just thought it was a lame story about a kid stuck on a boat with a bunch of zoo animals, try it again; and really pay attention when Pi finally starts telling his story to the officials.  Listen to the other story he offers and draw the parallels.  (Okay, seriously, if you haven't read the book yet, stop reading here.  You can come back to this later if you really want.)  His mother was the orangutan, the Chinese man with the broken leg was the zebra, and the crazy cook was the hyena.  He is Richard Parker.  He says many times that Richard Parker is all that kept him alive out there.  No matter which story you choose to believe, you have to believe that.   <br /> <br />Put yourself in Pi's shoes and you are hit with the sheer enormity of the task of survival, mentally and physically, no matter which story you choose to believe.  Add to that his faith which often pitted him against himself when faced with the things he had to do to survive, and his struggle just keeps getting bigger.  If nothing else, this story helps put things in perspective.  You may have had a bad day, but when was the last time you had to spend 227 days lost at sea with (or without) a bengal tiger?   <br />
B00005JMEW|3.0|Okay you have to see both movies to fully appreciate the Kill Bill Vol 1 dark comedy. The first movie is bloody revenge, and I do mean bloody. Go into this expect an over the top gorefest. Tarantino must have been low on iron when he made this since he obvioulsy wanted lots of red blood. Have I mentioned there is a great deal of blood and gore? Now that we have dispensed with all that blood and gore let us discuss the story. Most of this movie is marshal arts sword fighting. Expect to see some great fight scenes with lots of body parts sliced or removed.<br /><br />A former female assassin is pregnant and getting married. Her whole marriage rehearsal is wiped out by gunman. She is shot in the head and left for dead. When she survives she goes after the killers. She will exact revenge on the killers and all their henchman if it kills her, not that would really happen. Unfortunately the man who lead the group that killed the rehearsal, Bill, will escape as you might have guessed since there is a second movie. The second movie is awesome compared to this one, and once you see it you begin to appreciate this one and how it is what it is, a bloody revenge movie.
B000002U9Y|4.0|For anyone who likes the earlier works of Pink Floyd, this is an album that should not be overlooked.  Although it may not follow a consistent theme the way `Piper At the Gates of Dawn' does, I think that this album is actually more interesting and gives the listener a little more variety.   <br /> <br />Overall, where Piper follows a rather happy, childlike theme, dominated by Syd Barrett, Saucerful is more mysterious and really seems to showcase more of the qualities of the other band members, in particular Roger Waters and Rick Wright.  Another interesting aspect of this disk is that we see (or rather hear) Syd Barrett contributing to Pink Floyd for the last time, while David Gilmour is now part of the band, replacing Syd.   This album is probably closer to the more traditional sounding Pink Floyd, but the band still had a long way to go and were still finding their sound. <br /> <br />The album has a great spacey opening with \\"Let There Be More Light\\".  First we hear Roger pounding out a boogie beat of bass notes, and then we hear the tapping of Nick's cymbals at a fast pace, as Rick's organ with its far-out sound takes dominance.  After a moment the song cuts its tempo in half as we hear a whispering chant from Roger.  What's great about this song is the intensity it reaches at each chorus part, which quickly turns into that soft chant-like singing again.  This verse/chorus pattern repeats several times, until we hear David Gilmour finish out the song with some great guitar licks. <br /> <br />Rick Wright makes two worthy contributions to the album.  He certainly took a beating from his other bandmates (especially Roger), claiming his songs were`boring'.  I think his song contributions fit in very well with the other songs on the album and also, he deserves credit for contributing new material to the band at a time when Syd was just about to be ousted from the band.  \\"Remember A Day\\" starts out with Syd playing some really cool Slide Guitar licks, nicely augmented in the background with acoustic guitar and piano.  It starts out rather slow, but picks up quickly.  <br /> <br />Next comes \\"Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun\\", Roger Waters song.  The best thing about this track is the relaxed, yet haunting mood the song creates with bass, synthesizers, melotron, and light but rhythmic drums and crashing cymbals softly played in the background.   <br /> <br />\\"Corporal Clegg\\" may seem like a mistake to be on this album at first, being it seems so out of place.  Also, it's rather annoying when you first listen to it, but it grows on you after awhile.  There is good harmony singing throughout the song, going along with a driving guitar, drums, deep bass, and some nice organ work.  The song breaks into a carnival-like sound at the middle and end of the song, sounding like a kazoo festival.  It's probably the strangest anti-war song you'll ever hear.  Just because the song is so bizarre, it's fun to listen to. <br /> <br />The next song is one of the main attractions on this album.  This track really showcases the talents of the band putting their efforts in and getting an excellent result.  It's hard to describe everything that is going on (it's purely instrumental), just that it has four main parts to it.  The first part creates an eerie mood to it with its deep sounding bells, almost like what a very large grandfather clock would sound like.  Rick's organ playing is great, sounding as if it comes from a horror flick.  The second part showcases Nick's drumming, even if it does sound a little repetitive after a short while.  Rick crashes chords on the piano and we hear an `outer space' sound (similar to the middle part of \\"2000 Light Years from Home\\" by the Stones).  This part of the song could really sound terrifying to a young child.  The third part of the song is more eerie sounding organ playing by Rick, which blends into the fourth and final part.  The organ playing is no longer errie sounding but seems more like a church organ.  Soon after, a chorus joins in.  This is probably the best part of the song because of how peaceful it ends up.  It's as if the song is taking you on a journey. <br /> <br />\\"See Saw\\" is Rick's second contribution, and sounds nice and relaxing after listening to the previous song.  It has a very laid-back, floating, dream-like feeling to it, with nice piano playing and some light strings in the background. <br /> <br />The final song is actually the final song contributed by Syd.  It has kind of a strange, yet sad sound to it.  There are a number of different instruments and tempo changes on it, starting out with acoustic guitar and bass guitar, then adding some brass sections to it and eventually ending with Syd strumming the guitar and singing some off lyrics.  The saddest part of all was that Syd only contributed one song to this album (in the much earlier part of these sessions) and on the `Piper' album, he virtually wrote and sang on every song.  He had so much talent but unfortunately drugs wound up putting a permanent wedge between him and the band. <br /> <br />This album may not have been as structured as `Piper\\", but it is really worth listening to because it shows the other talents of the band more clearly for the first time.  I give this album 4  stars because although it's not their best accomplishment, the songs on their own are not bad at all, some being classics.  In my opinion, probably their best early album.
B00005JMAH|1.0|Yes, I am among all those diehard Harry Potter fans who were very disenchanted by the Prisoner of Azkaban.  This director most definately knows nothing about J.K.Rowling's books. It is too bad that Christopher Columbus could not do all of the movies! I know it must be hard to compress the whole book with so much vivid detail into a 2 1/2- 3 hour movie, but there was soo much missing that was important and too much nonsense (chasing his monster book under his bed, eating candy...) and he even changed the landscape of Hogwart's going to Hagrid's cabin.  Maybe the suggestion here is to all future directors: READ THE BOOKS, understand the characters, take notes from Christopher Columbus-keep the magic!! <br />Of course, I am still going to buy the DVD, I am curious about the extras.
B00006RINF|5.0|Lacuna Coil is simple amazing, the first time I heard them I was hooked and everything I previosly though sounded good (i.e Evanescence) was just mediocre. The song heaven's a lie left me speechless thats how good it was. If you listen to one song this year make it HEAVEN\\"S A LIE, this song can't be described by words so go listen to it!!!!!! <br />p.s if anyone dislikes this band then you simply dislike music, or you have serious issues with your life and tastes in beautiful music.
B00003CXCT|3.0|This COULD have been incredible.   Lucas has apparently surrounded himself by people that will not tell him when he is on the wrong track.  How unbelievable, in the age of the DVD, to not give us even the option, of watching the original release of the movies.  It is clear, with the release of Episodes I & II, that Lucas only cares about the money and no longer about the fan base that made him one of the richest people in Hollywood.  At this point, I wouldn't put it past him if he released some kind of \\"Collector's Original Edition\\" to coincide with the release of Star Wars Episode III, as a vehicle to make yet even more money.  Thank goodness I have access to the movies in their original format on LaserDisc.

B00005JMJ4|3.0|First of all, I don't hate this movie.  It was pleasant - not exciting, riviting or moving, but pleasant.  Bill Murray was exactly as he is in any of his dozens of slapstick movies, only a bit older and more sedate.  I have a feeling the only reason he was nominated for the oscar was because he's been around so long and is probably very popular with the other \\"stars\\" who decide these things.  He wasn't terrible, but one can only make that same lost-dog face work in so many movies. Scarlett Johannson was very good and you did feel for the loneliness of her character.  The filming was crisp, the sound quality is good and there are a few chuckles here and there, but for the most part I think many people raved over this movie due to their inexperience with Japanese movies and were enchanted by the different culture.  For a great Japanese movie, try \\"Shall We Dance?\\" or \\"Tampopo\\".
B00006GA48|5.0|I happened to hear the song \\"Sin's a Good Man's Brother\\" played by a DJ at a club recently.  While the song was playing I had to go ask the DJ what it was, and couldn't believe it was Grand Funk.  I didn't know much about them, but the song sounded like it was from a current hard rock/metal band. <br /> <br />Right away I ordered the cd and I couldn't believe the sound - so ahead of its time!  Big bass, guitars and drums, and great riffs.  Except for the vocals, you would never know that this album was from 1970. <br /> <br />It was also a treat to hear \\"I'm Your Captain\\" - never knew who that song was by, and its quite epic and monumental. <br /> <br />Great cd.
B00028HBKM|1.0|I see 617 people have reviewed this film, so I'm kind of on the end. I know that over the years any controversy sells tickets. It took me two days to sit through this movie, and not because of the beatings etc. It was trying to watch and read at the same time. It is right up there with \\"The last temptation\\", which was also unwatchable. The last \\"good\\" movie about Christ was \\"The King of Kings\\", those many years ago. At least I could understand it. One reviewer said if you want the life of Christ read Fulton Sheen's \\"Life of Christ\\" I couldn't agree more. If the right wing christians and jews had not said anything about this film it would have died a natural death, as would have \\"temptation\\". There are better ways to spend two hours. I was not \\"moved\\", nor did I cry as I tryed to watch this one. All I kept thinking was \\"what's the point?\\" and speak English so maybe I could \\"enjoy\\" the picture.
B000001EG6|4.0|Unfortunately, what he left behind is to be found on this album and three or four more from a time when he was \\"only\\" a powerful songwriter (this album, \\"Tumbleweed Connection\\", \\"Madman Across the Water\\", \\"Honky Chateau\\" and \\"Don't Shoot Me\\"). Even allowing for AM tracks like \\"Your Song\\" being thought of as earpaper, what about \\"Sixty Years On\\", from a time when hardly anyone of his generation (myself included) could care less about senior citizens. Today most of us are AARP members. Go figure. \\"No Shoestrings On Louise\\" is a fun track in the style of the countrified side of the Rolling Stones. The bouncy \\"Take Me To the Pilot\\", which really shines in the version appearing on the live \\"11-17-70\\" in pared-down trio form (oops, forgot that album). If this arc of Elton's discography was presented to somone who had never heard him, they'd wonder why he later became became the Liberace of rock'n'roll. Know what? So do I.
B00005JM1F|5.0|this is one of the funniest movies i have ever seen, it has so many  hilarious memorable quotes, if you like comedy, then you'll love old school
B000005S0V|5.0|Surely, Elton needs no introduction, as he was hugely popular around the world. During the period covered by this compilation, he only had two number one hits in Britain although he had several in America during the same period. Since then, he has had at least four further UK number one hits. So while many people consider the seventies and eighties to be Elton's golden years, he has demonstrated that he is not finished yet.<br /><br />Even in 1990, Elton had too many great songs to fit on a double CD, the most notable omissions from this one being Tiny dancer, Island girl and Little Jeannie. His more recent compilation covering his career up to 2002 was issued with slightly different track listins in the UK and USA included some of these songs (which ones depend on the edition) but several other tracks were omitted to make way for them and the more recent songs. Lucy in the sky with diamonds, Pinball wizard, Part time love and Passengers are among the songs on this compilation that are omitted from both editions of the 2002 compilation.<br /><br />You probably have your own particular favorite Elton songs. Of those included here, my favorites in no particular order are Your song, Candle in the wind, Crocodile rock, I'm still standing, Part time love, Sad songs and his duet with the vastly under-rated Kiki Dee, Don't go breaking my heart. The song that really confuses me is Passengers. I've never actually figured out what the song is about. Still, it's not the only such song (another is Whiter shade of pale, the sixties classic).<br /><br />If you enjoy Elton's music but you're not interested in his more recent music, you may consider buying this compilation instead.<br /><br />I should add that I had no problem with this set, so the reviewer who had a defective copy must have been unlucky.
B000084T18|1.0|Horrible album: talking about killing, fu#king, drug usage, and other negative things.  The drug usage isn't so bad as the other subject but this album influences stupid sheeps to think that it is the cool thing to just go out and flash guns and or kill people they barely know for very stupid reasons.  I know that if you listen to this music that your attitude will change dramatically; almost like a drug you will noticed symptoms.  These include paranoia: for example your driving around and you look and people and think that everybody is against you so you dog every guy you see. Also you will think very stupid: example someone cuts you off while your driving, you get extremely mad and start yelling at them profanity and next thing you know you are flashing your gun stupidly and telling him stupid things such as \\"imma smoke you foooo!\\" which isn't proper english, which brings me to the next symtom, talking stupid.  Example \\"yo dogg imma go holla at the birdman and get some dat sweet leaf fo show, dog\\" which is just stupid..... Not even english.  You will also look at your woman as if you own her.  And you will also have the lust to buy incredibly expensive cloethes that say things such as phat pharm of G unit... which is a waste of your money and you know it.  Im too lazy to write more but i hope i save a lot of your from buying this and experiencing this negative symtoms from he Cd, i'm sure many you already experience a lot of these symtoms from listening to rap in general, and for you i say try too look at yourself and your freinds from the big picture and see where you are heading and see a more peaceful wortd that can made by you.
B00003CXDG|4.0|What an action movie! The stunts and face-offs were explosive... the John Woo Special.  Loved the motorcycle chase the most.. very original.  But then, there is Tom Cruise playing the  psychologically tortured survivor caught between good and evil.  \\"Am I evil?  Am I a good person who does evil things? Does my hair look good?\\" But, I still love it and watch it for the ACTION, and folks, isn't that what it's about with John Woo? <br />Oh, and don't forget to catch the skit with ben stiller in the special features.. it's a gas!
B00018D44U|4.0|For me personally, her first album was better but this one is still worth picking up.  My conclusion is that it's her voice alone that makes her such a great artist.  That may sound like a weird statement, but that's exactly what I mean.  Many artists are compelling because of the songs they sing, their performance strength or style, their looks, etc.....  In Norah's case it's just that VOICE, and I guess I can't get enough of it!
0440237688|5.0|Pulitzer Prize. <br /> <br />I know I'm exaggerating, but it's my opinion. The Giver is like <br />the biography of a young boy growing up in a Stepford-wife-ish <br />perfect world of rules. When I read it, it didn't feel like I was reading, it felt like I was sitting on the couch of my living room, watching the movie on a eight-foot screen. It's <br />amazing and fictionally truthful
0345452577|2.0|Very dissapointing. As a huge fan of the Alex Delaware novels and Jonathan Kellerman's style of writing, I was really looking forward to reading this book. Unfortunately, I found the main character, Jeremy Carrier, to be sad, whiny and an all around boring guy! The story took forever to develop and by the time it did I had stopped caring what happened.  He spent too much time introducting characters that ending up having little or nothing to do with the plot.  I was surprised at some of the twists near the end, but they weren't enough for me to recommend this book.  I finished reading it only to find out \\"who done it\\".  I recently read his new novel \\"Therapy\\" which I would recommmend along with most of the other Delware novels.
B000002P2W|4.0|Listening to Townshend scream, \\"There's No Way Out\\" on \\"However Much I Booze,\\" and you know your in for a trip down a dark road. Other than the silly/catchy \\"Squeeze Box,\\" THE WHO BY NUMBERS is one therapy session after another. Daltrey brings Townshend's emotions to powerful life on each number; although perhaps tellingly, he let Townshend sing \\"However much I Booze.\\" eevn when a number is lyrically positive, like \\"Blue, Red and Grey,\\" with its sentimental look at love, the love is a wistful, fragile thing; the sound of Pete's voice echoed by distant horns creating a sound of longing. \\"How Many Friends Have I Really Got?\\" asks a question that many would rather not know the answer to, and this theme of exposing every raw nerve gets to be tough to take for the course of the CD. But if you're just in one of those moods; let Townshend give voice to the pain.
B000001EHS|5.0|It's a fantastic album.  Give it a listen and see if it doesn't take you back to 1987 (well, those of you who were alive then)<br /><br />I can't really say much without repeating the praise heaped on Def Leppard by other reviewers.  Def Leppard will soon be releasing an updated \\"Vault\\" compilation, so this one will be deleted.  If you're a fan and you want both, add this to your cart now.
B000002UUH|1.0|OK bear with me. Before you look at the one star, read the review.  <br />John Lennon's genius is put to ill use in this collection. There is no attempt at chronology, the liner notes...wait, what liner notes! There is an abysmal idea of sequence, I mean \\"Cold Turkey is a phenomenal song, but making it the last cut? Why? Couldn't they find something a bit more uplifting? This is a slapdash effort and probably put together just to cash in. Lennon's legacy deserves better.
0790730960|5.0|Though not recommended for viewing by children under 10, &#34;Batman Returns&#34; is a definite improvement over the 1989 blockbuster. It's obvious that director Tim Burton had more creative freedom this time around. The result is a genuine vision behind the camera rather than filmmaking-by-committee. Admittedly, the 1992 sequel is a dark, strikingly mature fantasy-adventure with three iconic psychopaths —  Batman, Catwoman and the Penguin —  sharing screen time. However, it is the disturbing characterizations that make &#34;Batman Returns&#34; a standout among mainstream comic-book adaptations. The production design and special effects should have garnered Oscars, while the performances of Michael Keaton, Michelle Pfeiffer, Danny DeVito and Christopher Walken mesh perfectly with the expressionist surroundings. One wishes that Burton and Keaton had reunited for a third Dark Knight saga. Instead, Warner Bros. handed over the reins to schlockmeister Joel Schumacher, who drove the series into the ground with &#34;Batman Forever&#34; (1995) and &#34;Batman and Robin&#34; (1997). No wonder Keaton hung up his cowl.
1895565669|5.0|The first time I read this book my son was just a year old.  I had stopped to take a break at the mall and decided to review the book that I had just bought for my young son.  By the time I got to the end of the book I had tears running down my cheeks.  Now that my son is 16 years old we have gone through many of the stages that the book depicts and I cannot read this book still without it bringing tears to my eyes.  I cannot recommend it enough especially to every mother of a son.
B00004RJ74|5.0|Is it horror....is it action.....what is this? I don't care, all I know is that this is a really cool flick! The opening dialogue between the Texas Ranger and the unfortunate store clerk is worth the price of the disk alone! I can't believe there are reviewers here who say that this story isn't original! Please name one other movie that mixes so many genre's together in such a successful way??!! When I first heard about \\"Dusk\\" I didn't have much hope for it, I mean let's face at the time this was released Clooney was still doing \\"ER\\", and basically any movie starring one of NBC's stars from a \\"Must See TV\\" show was to be avoided like the plague, \\"Fools Rush In\\" with Mathew Perry, or \\"Ed\\" with Matt LeBlanc anyone?? So I went to see \\"Dusk\\" with some reservation, and I was immediately blown away. I won't go into much detail about the film, because if you don't know what it's about....then buy it and watch without reading further!! Suffice to say, it will be money well spent, and you will get quite a few hours of entertainment from the film and it's extras. If you like horror films, you are gonna like this...Tom Savini's cameo is a real treat. If you like action, cops & robbers shoot 'em ups, you will like this as well. This may be one of the most original movies to pour out of Hollywood in the 90's, and one you shouldn't miss. Go into it with an open mind, and yes there is gore aplenty, but if you are familiar with Tarantino that shouldn't come as any surprise and does not get in the way of the story, any more than the blood quotient affected \\"Kill Bill\\". Just sit back and enjoy this bizarre and horrifying journey.
0060090367|3.0|I gave it three stars, simply because I didn't think it really stood out.  It was a quick lighthearted beach read, and while predictable it did have it's moments.  I laughed, and even though I kind of figured the way the book would end up, I was happy when our heroine found what she wanted.  I think I will give another of the author's books a shot.
B00007LTIC|5.0|If you like classic Yes, you will LOVE Going for the One.  I can only assume it gets ignored because it came after Drama, but that is a real shame because it has fantastic songs.  Going for the One, in my opinion, is the greatest Yes song under 10 minutes. Wonderous Stories is another all time classic. If you consider yourself a Yes fan, you owe it to yourself to buy this one.
0451526384|5.0|Not all readers are captivated by this quiet, sad, reflective work. But it is also very joyful. It is Jane Austen toward the end of her life reflecting once again on love, companionship and the eternal knot of family, class and society. Anne Elliot is one of the truly abiding heroines of the modern novel: gentle ,wise, politic and balanced. She is a young, beautiful woman thwarted in an early love by societal and family  interests. But it is a joy to see her rise again by the recognition of others seeing these same  virtues. This is very different novel than Pride and Prejudice but if you don't think it as great a novel meditate again on its resonant power.
B0002DB52M|5.0|<br />Showcased in a play type stage setting, complete with drawing of a bush  or a dog on the floor in chalk with a \\"mulberry bush\\" or \\"dog\\" label, the movie at first annoys the viewer because it seems \\"cheap\\" for a cinema that could have easily had realistic props, but eventually, one realizes that this was necessary because everything is the dialog and the viewer needs to focus on the dialog. <br /> <br />I originally rented this DVD because I like the actress and because the \\"secret\\" that the synopsis said Grace possessed, got my attention. <br /> <br />I never thought I'd be taken on a psychological ride where the \\"good\\" people becomes worst than the \\"bad\\" guys could ever imagine--all in the name of being good.  The conversation between the gangster boss and Grace was incredible and hit a political idealistic point: just because someone (America) is powerful and wealthy doesn't mean that they should be held to a higher standard than someone that is less fortunate.  The latter might have to work harder and struggle more, but ALL humans should strive to be decent. To give a pass on someone's behavior because they are poor or disadvantage is actually the height of arrogance. <br /> <br />Dogville was the first plot that I didn't figure out within 20 minutes of the movie/story telling.  Years of films, books, t.v. had me believing that nothing was original;  that all projects were variations of something that had been done before. <br /> <br />This was an original. <br /> <br />I cannot give a story any higher praise than that.
B000001YOW|5.0|If you don't like ambience music or DO like instant gratification, than this album may not be for you.  There are pieces of ambience which some will refer to as \\"dull\\" but everyone is entitled to their own opinion I guess.  Personally when I put the CD in I was hooked in less than 30 seconds, but somethings sounded out of place but as with any good cd it only gets better with more listens, on the second listen the harmonies started fitting together and I liked it that much more.  Some people seem to think that \\"Signify\\" (the song) is a \\"metal\\" imitation.  At first it seems that it could be heavier but when the rythem changes it all makes sence.  I HIGHLY recomend this album to anyone who wants to enjoy their music more everytime they listen to it.
B0000DJZ8R|5.0|Only the genius of John Ford and the merciless pen of Steinbeck could build such powerful movie . In these hard times when the WW2 covered the whole environment and the people went to movies to get fun , Ford showed this dark nightmare about the desillusion of a crowd of hopeless people literally exiled when they are ejected from their original lands and persuaded to live in California where best times are yet to come .<br /><br /> This realist portrait ,  sober and  moderate adaptation of the novel of John Steinbeck presents a sinister chronology of misery so painful and bitter as any other one in the American cinema . The landscape is behind of all these afflictions of the Joad and Ford carries the dusty highways and the unlimited horizons of such intensity that the loaded truck appears as a Noah Ark which takes to one or two of each generation far from a desert beated by the wind . The darkness brings uncertainity and fear . But with this premise Ford will turn the destiny and will provide of optimist hope for the new and promised land .<br /><br />Without any doubt , this film is one of the merciless and powerful films which deals with such theme .<br /><br />Far from North America , the echoes of the new ideologies shocked the world ; the utopic projects inflamed the imagination of famous writers and Steinbeck was one of them , infected for those old fashioned moods . In the Eastern World Shostakovich and Boris Pasternak ; in Europe Bertold Brecht and Kurt Weill , and in America John Dos Passos and Sinclair Lewis who had shocked the literary world with his unforgettable work : Babbit .<br /><br />Those were hard days , and the shadows of the war foretold dark large threatening clouds.<br /><br />The Manhattan Project was in full development and Walt Disney handseled Fantasy.<br /><br />John Ford made a curious twist in his filmography ; specially when he had thrown The stagecoach , a mythical film about the emblematic mythology of the American cinema as the Western meant. Nevertheless this picture was awarded with all the possible honors and somehow was the initial jump for a young actor as Henry Fonda who would become in one the antihero archetype along two decades in films such The Ox bow incident , 12 angry men , The wrong man .<br /><br />Fundamental issue in the early forties .<br /><br />Magistral transfer on DVD .is picture was awarded with all the possible honors and somehow was the initial jump for a young actor as Henry Fonda who would become in one the antihero archetype along two decades in films such The Ox bow incident , 12 angry men , The wrong man . <br />Fundamental issue in the early forties . <br />Magistral transfer on DVD . <br />
B00007AJF8|4.0|Reasons to see this movie: I loved Adaptation and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind but hadn't seen this, the film that put Charlie Kaufman on the movie. It's hard to say that it's his most original because they're all so original - but I'd have to say it takes the cake. Amazing performances from all of the leads, but it's Catherine Keener who tops them all as the manipulative Maxine. John Cusack's obsessive Craig is also fantastically done. <br /> <br />Reasons not to see this movie: I assume this is the kind of film where you love it or you hate it. It's definitely out there and if the idea of being able to go into John Malkovich's head and getting spit out onto the New Jersey Turnpike is too much for you, you won't be able to enjoy it. <br /> <br />Overall: Fantastically original, fantastically acted...in a word, fantastic.
B0002S94BG|5.0|Jeff Buckley only ever completed one full LP, and yet his name and his music are inspirational for all kinds of different \\"artists\\", from actors Brad Pitt and Penelope Cruz, to musical acts as varied as Coldplay, Starsailor, Out Lady Peace, Pete Yorn & Ryan Adams, among others. His music transcends genres and has become intensely appealing to pretty much every kind of music fan there is over time.  <br /> <br />While Sketches & Buckley's live albums have been okay, I was worried when Songs To No One came out. It was not nearly close to the level of Grace, and made Jeff, who had decided to not release any of the songs off it save for two, and moreso Grace, look like a little bit of a fluke. I hope every day that hno one getting into Jeff Buckley's music will pick it up. <br /> <br />And then came the Sin-E Legacy Edition. Right from the get-go, on \\"Be Your Husband\\", Jeff Buckley is absolutely brilliant. <br /> <br />The same goes for this, but moreso; Jeff Buckley has never come off better as he does here, both in his DVD, in the re-release of the initial Grace CD and in the bonus CD featuring gems like his rendition of Hank Williams' \\"Lost Highway\\", a hilarious and delirious rendition of \\"Screamin'\\" Jay Hawkins' \\"Alligator Wine\\" and on the best song of the bonus disc, \\"Forget Her\\", a song which was originally going to be on Grace in place of \\"So Real\\". Here, we get to listen to both, and more. <br /> <br />The bonus CD doesn't match the quality of Grace, but as far as an epilogue on Jeff's life, it surpasses Sketches and even the Sin-e Legacy Edition, for taking Jeff at his least commercial and maintaining that \\"I can't stop listening to him\\" quality throughout. <br /> <br />It may be a little pricey, but it's worth seeking out.
B00005JNEI|1.0|Michael Moore has walked into this project, as he does with most of the films he makes, to prove his preconceived notions of what truth is. He takes facts and presents them very craftily to weave webs of unrelated incidents together in hopes of having the audience draw logistical conclusions that are pure propaganda - at its worst. Not so much a documentary, as a current day French Fairy Tale.;&#62;)
0375507256|5.0|This novel consists of six interlocking stories, with common threads running thru them. Each one is set in a certain time period, written in a different voice/style (journal, letters, mystery thriller, memoir, sci-fi interrogation, oral story).<br /><br />The first is set in the 1840/50s in the South Pacific. It is interrupted in the middle of a sentence by the next story, which takes place in the 1930s in Belgium. Each story takes place farther down the timeline, and is interrupted until you get to the sixth one, which is told in its entirety. Then you go backwards, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 thru the stories again and get the conclusions.<br /><br />The future stories, the 5th and 6th, I enjoyed the most. The 5th takes place in the future where coporations run what is left of the planet and use clones as slaves. The 6th takes place on Hawaii after the end of civilization.<br /><br />The stories encompass love, hate, art & music, greed, sacrifice, economics, religion, and ultimately - how people treat each other vs. how they should be treated. On a personal scale as well as in the context of race and nations.<br /><br />Those looking at this novel as a puzzle to fit all the pieces together (like some reviewers) will be disappointed.  The stories may have connections, but it is the overall themes that really bind them together.  A sad yet hopeful novel. I highly recommend.
B0002IQHY8|1.0|As a major fan since the first album in the 70's I have enjoyed the incredible music of Alan Parsons. A VALID PATH has all the great production that you can find on any of his releases, but that is all that I can find.. Great production and boring Electronica music that goes on and on.. David Gilmore's guitar work couldn't save the track he plays on, and the David Pack track is horrid (DAVID ALWAYS CONTRIBUTES AMAZING TRACKS..) I never write poor reviews on albums, but this is as bad as Wishbone Ash's Electronica release TRANCE... I am sure it is some people's music and there will be fans who love it, but be warned.. THIS IN NOT TYPICAL ALAN PARSONS..... The best thing about listening to this album one time is that I appreciate all of the other releases even more, and have loaded those into the player to help me forget about the bad experience A VALID PATH gave me... Like being thirsty for a drink of cold water.. knowing the fountain you get it from is magic and you will savor every drop.. only to find that the water is warm and stagnant.. I wish I had known in advance that this album took such a different PATH.  Looking forward to the next Alan Parson's album and a cool drink of water... Mr. Parson's, if you do indeed read these reviews, I will still continue to buy and support your music, regardless of what you release.. Maybe this will grow on me. I appreciate everything else you have done, and have purchased all of it through the years.. Thank you for the good ones! Again, some will love this music, but it is not typical Alan Parsons!!!
B000000WA4|5.0|I have been a fan of the Smashing Pumpkins for a long time now, and this is, by far, my favourite album from them. They roamed around in different styles while recording this and struck an interesting blend. It is a mix of aggressive rock/nearly metal, and slower, very emotional tracks. The slower, emotional tracks really show their talent in recognizing sonic beauty. Theres alot of influence here from bands like My Bloody Valentine, and Nirvana, and it really brings out the Pumpkins' talent. Many people say that Siamese Dream is better, but I believe that Siamese Dream was the main building block leading up to this amazing 2 disc album. <br /> <br />Favourite Tracks: <br />Disc One <br />3. Jellybelly <br />7. To Forgive <br />11. Galapogos <br />12. Muzzle <br />13. Porcelina of The Vast Oceans (*****) <br />Disc 2 <br />4. In The Arms of Sleep <br />5. 1979 <br />13. By Starlight (*****) <br />14. Farewell and Goodnight <br />
0451163540|3.0|Ken Follett has created an entertaining collection of characters is this spy thriller and added a hint of romance. The competition between spies involves a combination of Egyptian, Israeli, and Russians whose path crossed at Oxford!<br /><br />I spent time doing the audio (unabridged edition) and enjoyed most of it. However the accent of Dickstein sounded more Australian to me and parts literally put me to sleep!<br /><br />Overall it was engaging. Not at the top of my list but definately worth reading it you like spy stories with great characters.
B000000OSG|5.0|This is THE best CD of all time. Every song fits perfectly.  <br /> <br />Civil War-Really good song, with 2 different choruses. This makes a great start. 9/10 <br />14 Years-I love this song. The chorus is cool. It has a really good piano too. I don't know why people don't like it. 9/10 <br />Yesterdays-This song is so-so for me. It seems a bit too monotonous... 6/10 <br />Knockin' On Heaven's Door-Who hasn't heard this song? The bad part is, its not that good as everyone says. 7/10 <br />Get In The Ring-WOW. Easily my favourite here, believe it or not. It's perfect. The lyrics are funny, and the melodies rock. My favourite part is when the crowd screams \\"GET IN THE RING!\\" near the end. 10/10 <br />Shotgun Blues-A decent song. 7/10 <br />Breakdown-This song is funny, the speaking in the end is really funny, but the chorus sucks. 7/10 <br />Pretty Tied Up-The start rocks, but the rest doesn't quite make it. I like when Axl sings \\"I just found a million dollars that someone left by...\\", not that is my favourite tune but those lyrics seem to fit there. 7/10 <br />Locomotive-Oh yeah! The pre chorus rocks! But the chorus and ending kill the song. 8/10 <br />So Fine-Another favourite, I like the way Duff sings, the chorus is good and so are the lyrics. 9/10 <br />Estranged-Oh yeah! Third best song of all time. This song roolz! 10/10 oh yeah! <br />Don't Cry-Another favourite, I was hearing it when I was falling asleep and I was like \\"Woow.\\" Even though Axl was saying \\"Don't you cry tonight\\" i felt like crying. Even though Estranged made me like GN'R, I didn't listen to their other stuff until listening this song. 10/10 <br />My World-The ending was perfect, why did Axl kill it here...     -10/10
0451204530|5.0|This book was so interesting trying to figure out who Luke was and what happened to turn his friends against him. So much at stake. I really cared about the characters. It kept going back to the fifties when everyone was young, so I couldn't wait to find out what had happened in the past and what was at stake in the future. And I didn't expect such a great romance. This book had everything!
B00000K3D4|4.0|I loved this movie when I was young, and still love it now, as an adult, and I also see things I didn't notice when I was young. Obviously cos I'm older now. I always wanted to be Sarah when I was young.<br /><br />When I watch this movie as an adult (and find David Bowie extremely distracting from the waist down), I think it's a shame that it's rated U. There's so much chemistry between Jared (David Bowie) & Sarah (Jennifer Connelly), especially in the ballroom scene, and you find if it hadn't been rated a U, then their relationship could have developed more. But then, they probably would have had to get an older actress instead of Jennifer Connelly, as she would have been 15 or 16 at the time of making. There seems to be an instant attraction between the two characters, but maybe someone should have pointed out he's got a sock stuffed down there - I've seen a lot better and more subtle 'packages' than that! *drool*<br /><br />David Bowie does 5 original songs for the soundtrack of this, and during the 56 minute documentary which is included in the extras, you see him singing the end credits track \\"Underground\\". He also sings \\"Magic Dance\\", \\"Chilly Down\\", \\"As The World Falls Down\\", and \\"Within You\\".<br /><br />All the characters that feature in the labyrinth, also feature as toys in Sarah's room in the beginning. She has a stuffed animal that looks like Sir Didymus on her shelves, a doll that looks like Ludo near her window, a Firey doll on a shelf, a statue of Hoggle as a bookend, and a figurine of Jareth the Goblin King on the right hand side of her desk. Also, the dress that she wears in the ballroom scene is the same as the one on her musicbox doll, and the marble labyrinth game is the same as the hedge maze that comes later.<br /><br />One of the worst scenes that stopped this being a 5, is the scene which features those Firey creatures, who throw their heads about. I'll give them credit where it's due, because it was 1986, but when you get older, you can see the outlines! I was never that keen on Sir Didymus either. His voice is really grating. This scene was unnecessary and should have been scrapped.<br /><br />The whole film is basically about Sarah changing from a young girl into a woman. Her older man crush on David Bowie disappears along with all her toys into a drawer, only to be pulled out years later.<br /><br />My favourite characters? I was never that keen on Ludo as a child, but watching him now reminds of Niall from The Young Ones. My other favourite is the little worm that speaks to Sarah at the start, he reminded me of the Glo-Worms I had as a child. And he made Sarah go the wrong way!<br /><br />The film is very similar in ways to Alice In Wonderland, which was never one of my favourite stories. Too many characters, who didn't really do a lot. The characters in this don't have the same fate, and instead, the only characters who are unnecessary are those fiery head throwing characters.<br /><br />I will always love this movie, but I think I'll stick with the copy I have. The collector's edition has more stuff in it, but not stuff I'm really interested in. I've yet to see Dark Crystal as well, but I reckon the reason I love this movie so much is because I wanted to be Sarah, then & now. The documentary is well worth watching, the best bit, is Jennifer & David having a laugh in their ballroom costumes. If you haven't seen this movie, I beg to ask why not?een on Sir Didymus either. His voice is really grating. This scene was unnecessary and should have been scrapped.    The whole film is basically about Sarah changing from a young girl into a woman.

B0000026NC|4.0|This isn't your average fairytale. This isn't just a song or a beat. It's a story of depression. Most people would say it's a song about drugs. There is a big difference about what something is about and what it deals with along the way. <br /> Pink Floyd is nothing less than a suffering artist. Four guys playing music, NO! Four guys telling a story. Raw emotion bleeding from the guitar, time set on the drums, the voice made by the bass, the wound slowly healing through the lyrics. They don't live your basic lives, they're rich and famous but strung out and restless. <br /> \\"Comfortably numb\\" isn't a song you hear once and understand, I didn't get it at first. Not because they are a band from before my years, but because I WAS comfortably numb.   <br />\\"Comfortably numb\\" is only ONE of the great songs on the Delicate sound of thunder album. These songs, stories, melodies, legends, masterpieces, whatever you want to call it, it's a count of true life made art.
B000002I53|5.0|this album only deserves one rating 5 stars. What was supposed to be a laid back session of standards has become a timeless classic. Every song on this album is a highpoint. I like bluetrane the best but this one comes in close second along w/ giant steps. Giant Steps may showcase trane's talent more but my fav things shows his timeless class.
B0002IQJUK|5.0|This has got to be the best cd that I will probably hear in my lifetime.  This cd is complete with heart wrenching songs like 'Just Friends', and 'More Than Anyone.'  And I have not been able to get enough of 'Chemical Party' and 'Crush'... Awe, forget all that, there is not a single song on this cd that I don't love.  I have been in love with this album the minute that I first played it.  I bought it when it first came out and I have not gotten sick of it yet.  I love that Gavin came out with 'Chariot Stripped', I got a chance to see him live on the Virgin College Mega Tour, and not only is he a great singer, but an awesome performer, and a very nice and humble person.  Clive Davis compared him to Elton John, and I disagree.. Gavin tops Elton by 100%.  I definitely recommend everyone to buy this cd.  I promise that you will not regret it!
B00005BJ2O|5.0|This amazing soundtrack perfectly complements an amazing movie. I didn't catch on to the Moulin Rouge craze that my friends were in until earlier this summer. Since then, I have seen the movie several times and the soundtrack is constantly spinning.  <br /> <br />I particularly enjoy the songs that are sung by the cast, primarily Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor's songs. Ewan McGregor has an amazing voice, for someone who was not trained in singing!! My favorite songs on the soundtrack are \\"Your Song\\" and \\"Come What May\\". The former is McGregor's rendition of the song and just has a great sound. The latter is a duet with McGregor and Kidman. The song blends perfectly with their two untrained voices and produces a lovely song, definitely one of the soundtrack's best. <br /> <br />Rufus Wainwright's Complainte de la Butte is worth listening to; it's a very very pretty song, similar to something you'd hear on the Amelie Soundtrack. El Tango de Roxanne, Sparkling Diamonds, and One Day I'll Fly Away are also notable songs. <br /> <br />I won't point out the shortcomings of the soundtrack [mainly the absence of some songs]; many other reviewers already did. I highly recommend purchasing this CD!! <br /> <br />
B0002S94BG|5.0|This is a haunting product.  From the opening of the cd case one is touched by Buckley's \\"Grace\\", his incredible prescence, and his untimely departure.  I lifted the DVD from the case, and Buckley's gaze came to me.  The DVD is astounding, and the new releases, especially the final track, a new rendition of \\"Dream Brother\\", are chilling.  His writing inspire many still today, and this re-release of his only true studio album explains why.  5 Stars.
B0001ZX0OW|2.0|This movie is suspenseful enough and had good acting, but the plot was very hard to swallow. The character of Jimmy, who's daughter was murdered, is very unlikeable. He is basically an ex-con with a very shady past, who associates with thugs. He gave me the creeps.I agree with another reviewer: Might does not make right. Also, Dave is pitiful enough, and I empathised with him for all the horror he went through as a child, but he seemed rather dim-witted. Didn't his parents ever tell him not to get in a car with strangers? And why didn't his friends try to help him, like tell him to run? I didn't think that excused what he did later as an adult, and despite other's opinions, I don't blame his wife in the least for not trusting him and being afraid of him, but she would've been wiser going to the police instead of a thug like Jimmy with her suspicions.As for Sean, he was the most likeable up to a point, until you find out what a corrupt cop he is or maybe just too wimpy and intimidated by Jimmy to do what's right in the end. It seemed like the two of them were agianst Dave from the beginning. This story was disturbing at the most, and very disappointing. There are numerous crime movies that are better with more likeable and believable characters. I'd pass on this one.
0375507256|5.0|I'll admit that, even though I found the writing consistently impressive, I was thrown off by the jumps in time.  With each new section, I found myself disappointed, as I was so entrenched in the previous chapters/eras.  After the middle section, though, the pieces fit together, and I thought it was an all-around wonderful novel.  I truly hope that this wins the Booker Prize this year and I look forward to reading his other books.
B000001ZSE|4.0|This was one of my first CD's I got in 80's decade at the age of 17, when vinyl records still were the highest selling. I knew most about Jarre's music so I thought it deserves to be listened in the best format. <br /> <br />The start is superior. The five cuts from Oxygne, Equinoxe and Chants Magnetiques are put together like in their original albums: all in a row. The selection is perfect. <br /> <br />Far as you can imagine, the time order is broken with the irruption of \\"Computer Weekend\\" and a little bit forward \\"London Kid\\". These cuts from Revolutions are not the best of this album. You can take out the first and put \\"Revolutions\\" or \\"Ouverture\\" or \\"Part 1\\".  <br /> <br />In the track list there is a mistake (or is that on my CD?), because \\"Zoolookologie\\" is not present. And this is a pity, as Zoolook is not good represented too in this compilation. \\"Ethnicolor 1\\" is far away from \\"Zoolook\\" and \\"Zoolookologie\\". <br /> <br />In this point, things come really better with the two excerpts from The Concerts in China, that are \\"L'Orcheste sous la Pluie\\" and \\"Orient Express\\". Then again, the order is broken with the inclusion of the two best parts of En Attendant Cousteau: Calypso 1 and Calypso 3. This excellent group of five is ended with \\"Fourth Rendez-Vous\\", one of the best songs of Jean Michel Jarre. <br /> <br />Next, the quality is lowering again: \\"Moon Machine\\" and \\"Globe Trotter\\" are decent tracks but not for a \\"Very Best Album\\". Funnily enough Jarre starts in this album a tradition that you will find in some other artists: to include a new piece in a compilation of Greatest Hits, that is \\"Eldorado\\". Previously unreleased and a testimony of his due to UNESCO. <br /> <br />Finally, what can I say of \\"Second Rendez-Vous\\"? This is one of the masterpieces of the music of the end of the XX Century. Magic, strong, plenty of sensations, this track is the perfect finale for this album (and for each of Jarre's concerts). <br /> <br />I love Jarre's music, but I cannot give five stars to an album that, out of 17 tracks, I dislike 4, moreover, knowing these four can be replaced by four better tracks from the same albums.
B000001FG5|5.0|The Spirits Having Flown album is not only the last disco album of the Bee Gees, but one of the BEST ones too!  Tragedy rised up to US #1 because of its strong and energetic music.  Too Much Heaven also went to #1 because of its sweet melody.  This song was later tributed to the UNICEF by the Bee Gees.  Inside and Out went to #1 after those two did.  THe other songs were just as sweet as the mentioned #1 hits. <br />   Saturday Night Fever brought the Bee Gees to their height of their career, and they took this chance to write more songs.  But they actually had some problems, because they already achieved 5 #1s in SNF, and if they produce another album that sucks, the public will reject them. But they trusted in themself, and believed that they can achieve more #1 hits, and succesfully, they did it! Great album!
B0000AM6K2|4.0|The one thing that stands out on this album is Rouse's strong songwriting.  An album that uses so many of the sounds of the early 70s could easily sound cliched - especially at a time where every new band seems to be reminiscing about the past, - but Rouse's songs are strong enough to work in any format. <br /> <br />Rouse's songs are powered along by groovy baselines, the odd flute or saxophone, and driving rhythmns. Yet he could probably play the entire album on an acoustic guitar and the songs would still shine. <br /> <br />It's an album of sunshine with the odd lines such as: <br />I told you a thousand times/I sold you a thousand lines/\\"I love you would you marry me\\". <br />to give the album needed bite. <br /> <br />You could dance to it, sing to it, or cheer yourself up on a rainy day.
B000001FNL|4.0|Main Course was a new and fresh album for the Bee Gees. Because the previous album Life in a Tin Can didnt go anywhere on the US Chart since Run to Me (To Whom It May Concern), so the three guys have to think up something that will attract the public interest. They switched the recording studio, and there was a bridge that the BG's had to cross everyday. Barry made up the song Jive Talkin' by using the rythem on the bridge.  During the recording of Nights On Broadway, Barry found his new hidden voice, the falsetto voice.  There, they started new rock songs, such as Winds of Change, and Fanny (Be Tender With My Love).  But they still kept their old ballad form of songs, that shows in Songbird, Country Lanes, and Edge of the Universe. <br />  Because of their success of changing from old ballad songs to more of rock songs, they achieved #1 in US Chart with the song of Jive Talkin', and #7 with Nights On Broadway.
B000002LQR|2.0|hmm... i was just introduced to this band a couple weeks ago not knowing anything really about them. After spinning this album once all the way through I couldn't really understand what all the hype was about? All the guitar and drum work was really fantastic but the lead singer... man, do i even have to say it? he just sucks. His voice is so annoying I can't get past a minute on any song listening to this no talent bum. I don't mean to offend but seriously...this band needs a new lead singer. And if he writes the lyrics too ahaha..wheeeew...that crap definitely has to go lol. Its ashamed to see a great band like this be hindered down by bad lyrics and vocals.
B000001FAW|4.0|After Main Course, the Bee Gees started to write more songs that were into rock and roll, and disco.  Songs that are featured in this album are You Should Be Dancing (#1), Love So Right (#6), Love Me (#7), Boogie Child (#13), and Children of the World (#24).  In comparison to Main Course, this album is better, but if you compare it to the Spirits Having Flown, its a little too weak. The reason I suggest that is because the Bee Gees had gained more confidence in writing after the Saturday Night Fever Soundtrack, but they are stronger than Main course, since Main Course was a switch for them. <br />Great album. Nice painting at the front!
B00003CXCT|4.0|Like many people of my generation, I grew up watching Star Wars movies and playing with the action figures & games that came from them. I have fond memories of watching the movies for the first time in the theater with my father and I've always cherished them for the fine works if imagination they represent. After years of weening a generation on these films, George Lucas releases the Special Editions to mixed reactions. While many of the changes made the movies feel fresh, many of them seem out of place or just plain wrong. Certainly there is room for both versions of these films. While the new versions are suitable for refining George's \\"vision\\", the originals need to be preserved so  they won't be lost forever. The Star Wars trilogy inspired a generation and regardless of their creator's \\"vision\\", they deserve to be remembered as they once were. While these classics may not look as impressive as films released twenty years after their initial release, there is still something to be said about their original charm. Besides, I'll take a Muppet over bad CG any day.
B0002IQHY8|1.0|Make that ZERO stars please! This one has already gone back to the store to be exchanged. Don't get me wrong. I have always respected Alan Parsons. He has created some of the best music in rock-n-roll history. Eye In the Sky is in my top ten Desert Island albums. I have seen his live show and it's great. Now he goes and mucks it all up with a new record so painfully bad that I will probably never buy one of his new releases again. Remember when Todd Rundgren made an album on which he tried to rap over drum machines and programmed music? This is worse! Remember when Pat Boone tried to sing metal? This is worse! Remember that annoying novelty song with a baby singing disco? That's just what the remake of Mammagamma sounds like! It's THAT BAD people! A BABY singing on an Alan Parsons record!!!??? Is he intentionally trying to tick off his fanbase? Sadly the baby sings better than the guy with the generic 'alternative-band' accent who mucks up More Lost Without You, a really lousy attempt at a radio hit. Come to think of it every song is lousy. If it's CLASSIC ROCK you are looking for, then try the latest album from ASIA, Silent Nation. It's the best album of the year. Asia's new one even has a new song called Gone Too Far that sounds closer to classic Alan Parsons Project than anything you'll find here. Nothing to be heard here but annoying dance grooves, laughable attempts at hit singles, and that stinking baby. What a cryin' shame!
B0002EXH54|5.0|The original \\"Peace Sells\\" is rough and raw.  That quality makes it great.  It also makes it awful.    I understand why people detest an artist's choice to remake an album: why mess with perfection?  The material on this album makes it a Metal masterpiece!    I've been waiting since the late '80s for a remastered version of \\"Peace Sells\\" because the CD sounds like a stylus scraping against a worn groove...  inside a steel drum... while water rushes loudly outside.    There will always be a rash of people upset that the remastered sound is cleaner, more polished.  They do make a good point since the songs will obviously sound different than the original.  But I can't enjoy listening to 96Kb MP3s, so why should I tolerate hissing noise from the original recording?    I'm also glad to hear a version of this great album that brings me to center stage instead of stranding me inside a car on the side of the highway opposite the stadium where one of my favorite bands plays \\"Devil's Island.\\"  Another classic metal CD that badly needed a remaster was Queensryche's \\"Operation Mindcrime,\\" and that finally happened too.    I'm going to listen to this remastered version of \\"Peace Sells\\" for the next month on my drive to work.  On a good stereo.
B0002YHFZC|5.0|I was lucky enough to be present that night, freezing cold winds and snow whilst queuing for several hours outside and the atmosphere was incredible being in a darkened ballroom ! The performance was electric and the crowd had fun bouncing on the great sprung ballroom floor! <br />Yet to recieve the DVD but if it is 1% of the performance on the night then EVERYONE should own it! <br />Looking out for myself at the front of the crowd can't wait !
B0002Z0EYA|3.0|Many milennia ago, so far back that even historians can't pin it down, a man named Homer apparently wrote an epic Greek tragedy entitled \\"The Iliad.\\"  Even that isn't entirely sure.  The existence of Troy, even longer ago, is a bit more sure, as is the belief that said Troy was involved in a war like the one depicted in this film.  Other than those generally accepted facts, it isn't known how much of \\"The Iliad\\" is myth or reality, although some of the characters are Greek gods and goddesses, which makes it easier to figure which parts of Homer's story might be myth.  So, let's not get all worked up about how historically accurate this film is, OK? <br /> <br />Those who know something about \\"The Iliad\\" will at least be interested to see how director Wolfgang Petersen and the staff of this production demythologize the story of Achilles, his heel, the Trojan horse, the man for whom Paris is named, and Helen of Troy whose face launched a thousand ships.  Many have had little good to say about the adaptation.  I'll say some good things, however. <br /> <br />For one, I bought Brad Pitt in the role of Achilles, although his character has been overwhelmingly modernized, like almost everything else in this version of the ancient tale.  A loner, the world's greatest warrior, iconoclast, apathetic in the extreme where politics is concerned, Achilles is presented as the kind of character who might say the modern line, \\"The men want to be me and the women want to be with me.\\"  Along the lines of eye candy for the guys, there's Diane Kruger, the lovely young lady who portrays Helen of Troy, her face truly worthy of seamanship on a mass scale.  Also excellent in supporting roles are Sean Bean as Achilles' adviser, Odysseus, and Brian Cox as the boastful Greek warlord Agamemnon. <br /> <br />It's a story on a vast scale, a tale of love, war, and tragedy.  So, expect romantic moments, huge battle scenes, and an unhappy yet appropriate ending. <br /> <br />There, however, the goodnews ends, for the most part. <br /> <br />The memorable and gripping moments of \\"Troy\\" are also unfortunately interspersed with some truly embarrassing scenes.  One that comes to mind is when Achilles hews off the head of a golden statue with his sword.  This would be fine if he had been presented as a supernatural figure, as he was in \\"The Iliad,\\" but remember, we have no gods in this film other than when their names are referenced by the all too human characters on screen.  No sword would truly hold up to a massive slab of gold, and the scene is ridiculous as a result.  Even worse are some incredibly melodramatic moments early in the film where a character's closeup is actually held for a couple of seconds while the film is switched to slo-mo until fadeout.  Nothing could possibly be more cornball, except perhaps the dialogue.  Julie Christie, in a cameo as Achilles' mother, is forced to spew some of the most horrid dialogue heard in recent years.  Scenes like hers set the motion picture industry back 50 years to the days of the hamminess of Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton.  Yeech. <br /> <br />And then there's the late great Peter O'Toole.  Oh, sorry, he's not dead?  Well, he looks it.  Aside from a touching scene in private with Pitt's Achilles, O'Toole, as the king of Troy, is seemingly one step away from the nursing home, both in looks and actions.  He's barely recognizable, the poor old sot.  Yet another parable about the destructive powers of strong drink, that man. <br /> <br />And the battle scenes are so \\"Lord Of the Rings\\"-like as to be blatantly obvious even to those who haven't seen any of the LOtR films.  It was once clever to computerize a few hundred extras and replicate them to become many thousands, but now it just looks cheesy.  Or maybe that's just \\"Troy\\" working its questionable magic again. <br /> <br />By the end of the film I was really unsure whether to be glad it was over, savor the occasional satisfying scene, or be sickened at theway the memorable fable of Achilles' heel is turned into almost nothing.  Upon further review, it's a bit of both.  \\"Troy\\" really has some fine moments and also some that are laughably bad.  Please don't take the film seriously, and you just might enjoy it as a rental.  I would not recommend a purchase.  \\"Das Boot,\\" Petersen's first film to make an international splash, remains his best work by far, \\"The Perfect Storm\\" notwithstanding.
B000002C2E|5.0|Plenty of people have attacked this album for lack of melody and poor lyrics. I would ask these people how familar they are with the blues. Time Out Of Mind is a latter day blues masterpiece, not blues-rock, but straight ahead blues. Even though the 12 bar form is only to be found on one of the tracks (Dirt Road Blues), the entire album is the work of a man who has lived the blues and travelled in the paths of the old bluesmen and folk travellers. The way Dylan sings on this album is the true gem. He's the quintessential bluesman, down and dirty but detached, he knows what's wrong and he's using blues to try and get outside of the problems. People who find something like this boring would probably be better off just buying a straight rock n roll record and leave this one to the music fans who truly takes emotional catharsis in hearing this beautiful, almost primitive type of music.  <br /> <br />Yes this record is a masterpiece. Dylan's howl is the dust from the trail of the world that has gone wrong. His phrasing is suberb (from Can't Wait for instance, listen to how he howls \\"Your loveliness has wounded me I'm reeling from the blow\\" or \\"I'm breathing haard standing at the gate\\") and the he gives every word on the album a life of its own. No these aren't the lyrics of a energetic 23 year old who likes word play (buy Bringing it All Back Home or Highway 61 Revisited if you want that) but they are the words of a man who has dedicated his entire life to his love of American folk and roots music. The lyrics are one more step in the folk process that Dylan so loves, he has absorbed the words of American musical tradition and continued a heritage that defined American music until the disposable pop age (ex \\"I'm just goin' down the road feeling bad\\" from Tryin' To Get To Heaven, a line found in many traditional songs). A modern listener who is used to the catchy melodies of modern music may be turned off by this album, but that's just because so much of an American musical heritage has been forever lost in this country. I'm only glad that Dylan at least still is aware of the traditions that not only gave birth to rock n roll, but defined the very lives of thousands of people over the centuries
B0002MPU1K|5.0|Peter's new CD is great.  \\"On the Moon\\" should be on a movie soundtrack.  I had no idea what to expect with \\"Bali Ha'i\\" since I don't really see Peter in raggy clothing in a production of South Pacific but he gave it a really funky beat.  I love \\"I Love Paris\\" and \\"St Louis Blues\\" - they're both really upbeat and fun.  And \\"You Don't Know Me\\" is one of my favorite songs and a great addition to the cd.  The last track is pure instrumental and Peter's piano playing is amazing.  I've been listening to the CD over and over again since I bought it.  This CD is perfect for people who kind of like jazz but err on the side of pop because it combines both styles and then some.
B00005Y7AW|5.0|I remember hearing much buzz around Rufus upon the release of his self-titled first album.  Ever mindful that there is also much buzz around swarms of killer bees and felonious haircuts, I stayed away.  Hearing Rufus himself would have to wait until I stumbled upon \\"Complainte de la Butte\\" off the \\"Moulin Rouge!\\" soundtrack... not his song, but a distinct improvement over any interpretation I had heard previously. \\"Hosanna in the highest,\\" thought I, \\"the buzzards actually got something right!\\"    What to do?  As I wallowed in willful blindness, this guy cut three (four if one adds the unreleased \\"Want Two\\" to the tally) albums, and I soon realized I was not in Kansas anymore.  Since I lack the requisite footwear to click my heels three times and hope for the best, I bought all three albums and hoped for the best. \\"Poses\\" was first in queue.  I wish I could ascribe musicologically cosmic motives to my choice.  Alas and alack, I applied the far more banal \\"what's the first song called?\\" test.  Then, as now, \\"Cigarettes and Chocolate Milk\\" seemed to me a more appealing prospect than \\"Foolish Love,\\" if for no other reason than that I enjoy the former and have seen my share of the latter.      Fortunately, \\"Cigarettes and Chocolate Milk\\" happens to be a strikingly original and genially self-effacing paean to overindulgence.  This theme is captured both in the lyrics and the music, which deviates from \\"spare\\" in virtually every respect. Rufus keeps this \\"singing shall set me free\\" lens focused squarely on himself throughout the album, including a brilliant exercise in double-entendre by covering his father's \\"One Man Guy.\\"  He seems completely at ease ignoring the precepts by which commercial music is ordained as such, though his radio-friendly \\"California\\" dispels any doubt that this tendency is a function of choice rather than necessity.  His greatest achievement on this album (and I soon found on others) is promulgating an effective species of songwriting bereft of slavish reliance to melodic symmetry, harmonically conclusive phrases, and uncluttered instrumental textures.  His genious is not in eschewing these practices but rather in supplementing them with musical devices all his own.     One minor gripe is that Rufus's pronunciation seems at times needlessly mannered. I too lived in Montreal over an extended period, yet his categorical refusal to sustain a note over the long vowel sound \\"ee\\" still perplexes me (or should I say \\"may\\"). Recently, a learned friend of mine explained that this phenomenon is known as \\"diphthong\\" problem in formal singing parlance. I'm reluctant to even mention a \\"diphthong problem\\" because it sounds like a case for a urologist. A quick skim of the liner notes confirms that a urologist is one thing this boy most definitely does not need. But I digress.     Rufus Wainwright communicates the plight of the forlorn and the foolish through decidedly non-formulaic musical language.  His lyrics frankly address his homosexuality.  In an ideal world, these characteristics would be virtues, or at least non-issues, rather than liabilities. Since we're saddled with the world we live in now, I doubt that Rufus Wainwright will soundly connect with the majority of the listening public. The goal of universal appeal seems as dubious as it is quixotic, especially since Earth does not want for people exhibiting deplorable tastes in all matters aesthetic (to wit, boy-bands, Capri pants and White House denizens).  There are far too many variables of the nature versus nurture variety to predict exactly who will enjoy this music. Rufus counts among his fans the the old and young, the enlightened and the daft, the boys and the girls (who may like boys, girls, neither or both). In short, it's pretty damned confusing. If you find yourself among the chosen few who latch onto the Rufus train, this album's got smoking wheels, and will lead you to a lovelier place.
B00005B36H|1.0|This is my first and last tool album i ever bought. It was also the wierdest and most spiritual music i have ever listened to. The music itself has great maturity and feeling...... but after a while, it's just BORING. There is nothing cool about the guitar or drum playing, and Keenan's voice is too soft and monotonous. If you are looking for great music listen to British Metal. \\"Iron Maiden\\" and \\"Judas Priest\\" are just awesome. <br />
0156027321|3.0|I opened this book with no preconceptions but quickly realised that while it has enough spiritual mumbo jumbo to appeal to many readers, but it was not to my taste. I found the pace of the story laboured and its themes poorly connected. I felt neither understanding nor empathy towards Pi, probably because there is little reflection of his own character in the descriptions of his companions and surroundings. The central section of the story aboard the lifeboat kept me sufficiently interested to press on, but in hindsight I felt let down. A few nice ideas here, but they are not explored nearly as well as they might be. In which case why not read a true account of survival, rather than this fantasy/fiction masquerading as fact?
B00028HBKM|5.0|When The Passion was released in theatres many months ago, I either had to work or when I went to the theatre found out that the theatre had sold out.  <br /> <br />So I went to my local Costco and bought the movie and watched it. All I can say is WOW---this is an awesome movie. Gory yes. But what do you think a crucifixion is, a party? <br /> <br />All christians should buy this movie. It will make you feel closer to God and help you appreciate just what Jesus Christ did for all of us. <br /> <br />Thank you Mel Gibson for a outstanding movie!
B000002IG4|5.0|In 1982,Phil Collins managed to put out his second solo album immediately following FACE VALUE the previous year. Hits include I DON'T CARE ANYMORE and a cover of the Motown classic YOU CAN'T HURRY LOVE. The latter was first recorded by the Supremes and was a hit for them in 1967. THE WEST SIDE is mostly instrumental. We hear PC's voice on that track but no words at all. He goes \\"Ohhh!\\" only. When PC's next album NO JACKET REQUIRED was released in 1985,he'd rise to superstardom and do very little with his band Genesis which he'd eventually leave. Also he'd become an actor as well,starring in 1988's BUSTER and having a short role in 1991's HOOK.
0141439831|2.0|I really wanted to like this novel. I am a huge book lover, and especially this sort of older novel. I am sorry to say I was disappointed. The novel is much longer than it needs to be. I do not have a problem with long novels in general (in fact, I've read The Mists of Avalon an embarassing number of times), but I do have a problem with novels that are long for no good reason. I also understand this novel was released in short bits over the course of many months, but that does not excuse the meandering storyline. Thackeray jumps back and forth both in time and in place. He wastes many a paragraph describing things that have no importance in the novel, or people who have no bearing on the story. Then, to make matters worse, he simply jumps over, or glosses over the seemingly most important parts of the story.  <br /> <br />Another problem I have with the novel is the way he writes the characters. None of them come across as all that endearing, except perhaps for Dobbins, who is so devoted and constant as to be unbelievable.  <br /> <br />I didn't hate the novel (hence the 2 stars), but I doubt I will ever bother to re-read it.
B000002I8D|5.0|Genesis' drummer/lead vocalist Phil Collins scored a few hits from his debut album. IN THE AIR TONIGHT and I MISSED AGAIN. The latter does not appear on 1998's HITS. IN THE AIR TONIGHT would be recorded live for 1990's SERIOUS HITS LIVE. The album title would become a subsidiary of Atlantic Records. Other highlights from this album include a cover of the Lennon-McCartney song TOMORROW NEVER KNOWS,a guest appearance by Eric Clapton,a good friend of PC's,a Genesis composition(written by Collins and his bandmates Mike Rutherford and Tony Banks) and the Ray Parker Jr. style of THUNDER AND LIGHTNING. The FACE VALUE of this album is anyone's choice. By the way,PC sings a few bars of OVER THE RAINBOW following the conclusion of TOMORROW NEVER KNOWS.
B0000541VQ|5.0|This is a tale about the ancien r&eacute;gime in18th century France before the revolution in which the moral decadence of the privileged classes rivaled that of Sodom and Gomorrah and the ancient Romans.  The story comes from a novel by Choderlos de Laclos that was made into a stage play by Christopher Hampton.  It is a cynical satire on human sexuality as well as a very subtle examination of sexual hypocrisy and desire, a kind of oh so sophisticated laugh at bourgeois morality that would have delighted Voltaire and Moliere and greatly amused Shakespeare.  It is a tale of elaborate lechery and revenge that backfires because it seems that anybody, even the most jagged rake can fall in love, and thereby become the victim.<br /><br />John Malkovich plays the rake, Vicomte de Valmont, whose sole purpose in life is to seduce women, rob them of their virtue and then move on.  Glenn Close plays his back-stabbing confidante and one-time lover, the Marquise de Merteuil.  Michelle Pfeiffer plays the coy and virtuous Madame de Tourvel, who is to be Valmont's latest conquest.  Uma Thurman is cast as a teenaged ingenue who is betrothed to Merteuil's lover while Keanu Reeves plays her naive music teacher and would-be lover, Chevalier Danceny.  Stephen Frears, who has directed such diverse films as The Grifters (1990) and My Beautiful Laundrette (1985), after a somewhat cryptic start, does an excellent job of bringing the biting cynicism of Laclos and Hampton to the screen.<br /><br />I know of two other versions of this film, Milos Forman's Valmont (1989), starring Colin Firth and Annette Bening, and Roger Vadim's Dangerous Liaisons (1960).  Regrettably, I haven't seen Vadim's film, but Forman's Valmont is excellent.  In polite society comparisons are said to be odious.  I shall proceed anyway:<br /><br />John Malkovich vs. Colin Firth.  Malkovich is widely recognized as a great actor, but he is clearly miscast in this role, yet he brings a predatory dimension to the part that is in keeping with the overall psychology of the movie.  Firth, while not as celebrated for his acting skills as Malkovich, is nonetheless a fine actor, and his charm and playful inventiveness are more in keeping with the character of Valmont, whom women love.  Call it even.<br /><br />Glenn Close vs. Annette Bening.  Again Close is considered the more accomplished actor, but Bening is sexier, prettier and considerably more charming.  Whether that is a plus as far as the reality of the novel and play are concerned is debatable.  For my part I found Bening a lot more fun to watch.  Edge to Bening.<br /><br />Michelle Pfeiffer vs. Meg Tilly.  Pfeiffer is a much bigger star and has more experience as an actress.  She is beautiful, but Tilly is more passionate.  Pfeiffer was nominated for an academy award for best supporting actress for her work here, but did not win.  Personally I thought Tilly was more believable and was especially effective in projecting first the repressed passion and then the complete abandonment as she gives herself to Valmont.  Pfeiffer's portrayal of  Tourvel's coy awakening, with just a hint of duplicity, and then her utter dissolution when he leaves her, was star quality.  Edge to Pfeiffer.<br /><br />Uma Thurman vs. Fairuza Balk.  I loved them both.  Thurman, of course, is a more statuesque beauty with a polished and controlled acting style, but Balk's wide-eyed innocence was a delight.  Call it even.<br /><br />Keanu Reeves vs. Henry Thomas.  Thomas was cute, but almost too juvenile to be believed.  Reeves seemed just right for the part.  Clear edge to Reeves.<br /><br />Frears vs. Forman.  Frears's direction was more cynical, especially in the duel between Valmont and Merteuil in which their mutual and complementary debauchery is in sharp focus.  And his resolution was more clearly defined.  Forman's strength was in the delight and playfulness of many of the scenes, especially those relating to the seduction of Tourvel.  His direction was more comedic and he allowed a greater development of secondary characters, while Frears concentrated more on the two leads.  I give a very small edge to Forman, but would not argue with those preferring Frears.<br /><br />Bottom line: I liked Forman's movie better, but the voters at the IMDb preferred Frears's Dangerous Liaisons, giving it an average of  7.7 stars out of ten to 6.7 for Valmont.<br /><br />Some bon mots:<br /><br />Valmont tells Madame de Tourvel as he dumps her, \\"My love had great difficulty outlasting your virtue.  It's beyond my control.\\"<br /><br />Valmont demands that the Marquise de Merteuil reply to his proposal of a night together, will it be love or war?  He says, \\"A single word is all that is required.\\"  Long pause, and then she gives him three, \\"All right. [Pause.] War.\\"<br /><br />When Valmont returns from making love to Madame de Tourvel he reveals to Merteuil that for the first time he may be in love.  He relates his feelings to her, \\"I love her.

B0002MPU1K|2.0|I saw Peter perform at the Westport Country Playhouse three summers ago in a totally enchanting concert, backed by several superb musicians.  He's a great act to see live, because he totally has the chops of a terrific musician. I thought his first CD was somewhat of a letdown - good, but as the initial reviewer has pointed out, he's vocally thin, and he sounds far too much like Harry Connick, Jr. - and really one is enough. Contrast his vocals with another newcomer, Michael Buble, who can really sing and brings his own personality and style to songs like \\"Moondance\\" and \\"Sway.\\"  Peter's own stuff is OK, nothing special.  The arrangements here are better than the vocals and it is fine for background music.  I would go with Buble's CD if you want something really swinging and moving too. Peter needs to develop in many ways: to lower his vocal range, to discover some new ways of phrasing, which will come when he has a better understanding of these songs, the way Sinatra or Crosby had.  I think the best thing he's actually ever recorded, vocally, is \\"The Rainbow Connection\\" from Sesame Street, from his first CD.  That's not meant as a knock.  But there's a simplicity and grace to his recording of that song that is lacking in too much of his other stuff. There's also a little more passion than is found here.  What is it with some of these new jazz people, Norah Jones, Diana Krall, included?  They \\"style\\" too much and FEEL too little. It comes off as arch and phony. But see Peter LIVE, by all means. As a musician, if not yet as a vocalist, he's the real deal!
B00003CXZ3|5.0|I have seen a lot of movies and almost always I know what the director is doing.  I know what the actors want to achieve.  I know what the aims of the producers are.  It's all transparent, but once in a while there is a work of pure genius that makes me think I really don't know anything at all.  Memento is such a work.<br /><br />Looking at the premise of this movie, I recall that it can really happen.  Neurologist Oliver Sacks, in his wonderful book, The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat (1986), recounts the story of a man who could only hold the memory of the last thirty seconds or so.  Leonard's condition in this movie is better.  Apparently he can hold in his mind what has happened over the last few minutes.  Also he has the ability to follow a kind of learned routine in which he is able to function by continually writing himself notes.  In the case recalled by Dr. Sacks, the man could not do that.  He could not even remember enough to finish a short conversation.<br /><br />The idea of taking notes to \\"remember\\" is something that some Alzheimer's patients are able to do in the early stages of the disease (which may be where Jonathan Nolan got the idea for his short story on which the film is based.)  Sacks recalls such a case in his An Anthropologist on Mars: Seven Paradoxical Tales (1995).  The notes act as the man's memory, just as the notes and photos do for Leonard in this movie.<br /><br />The next question might be, could someone with Leonard's \\"condition\\" actually function well enough to get by without being institutionalized or having somebody take care of him on a minute to minute basis?  Leonard says, \\"Habit and routine...conditioning make my life possible.\\"  He \\"remembers\\" to look in his jacket pocket to see where he is living.  Presumably he also does this when he is in his car and has forgotten where he is going and doesn't know where he is.  Presumably he has many notes that we don't see him refer to.  How does he find his way back to his car after going somewhere?  He identifies his car from a photo, but where is it parked?  In the scene where he wakes up next to Natalie, he gets up and goes to his jacket and finds her picture so he knows who she is.  He also finds a picture of her and Dodd.  He somehow \\"remembers\\" the significance and writes on the back of her photo, \\"...she lost someone too.  She will help you out of pity.\\"  How does he remember these things?  Perhaps they are examples of \\"implicit learning\\" that \\"Sammy\\" was not able to accomplish, what Leonard calls \\"conditioning.\\"  In implicit learning as opposed to \\"explicit,\\" we learn to do something without knowing we learned it.<br /><br />Regardless of these questions, this is a brilliantly conceived and plotted thriller, and the acting by the three principals is superb.  Guy Pearce plays Leonard in a most immediate and affecting manner so that we are forced us to identify with him and his predicament.  Carrie-Anne Moss, whom you may recall from The Matrix (1999), is mesmerizing with her sexy, mysterious eyes as the hard-edged and haunting Natalie.  Joe Pantoliano is first rate as Teddy, the wisecracking, cynical and rather annoying undercover cop.<br /><br />But what really makes this a stunning movie is the way it is constructed.  The scenes are presented in reverse chronological order, so that we know the latest action first, and at the end of the movie find out the earlier action.  This seems an extraordinary way to tell a story, but it works.  Incidentally, there's a Seinfeld episode told this way, the one where they go to India for a wedding; and to some extent this technique was employed in Quentin Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs (1992).  What makes it particularly effective here is the material.  Leonard, as Teddy points out, is not the same person he was before his wife's death and his injury.  For him the arrow of time has lost its meaning.  Earlier events are just the same as later ones.  Director Christopher Nolan (Jonathan's brother), whoalso wrote the screenplay, was able to dovetail the action scene by scene as we move backward in time so that what seems true in the beginning becomes different than what is true in the end.  And indeed, like Leonard, our experience of the story doesn't depend on time's arrow.<br /><br />Viewing this the second time (and you may feel a compulsion to do just that) some of the lines that were not funny initially become very funny.  The voice-over in the chase scene with Dodd is an example.  Leonard finds himself running and he says, \\"So what am I doing?...I'm chasing him....No, he's chasing me!\\"  Or when Teddy asks about the gun, Leonard says, \\"Must be his.  I don't think they'd let somebody like me carry a gun.\\"  Or Teddy's line to Leonard, \\"I've had more rewarding friendships than this--but I get to keep telling the same jokes.\\"<br /><br />The key to the powerful psychological \\"ending\\" of the film, where we realize what will eventually happen, occurs when Natalie tells Leonard that revenge is useless because he won't remember it.  He replies, \\"It doesn't matter whether I remember or not....\\"  Indeed we see that he really doesn't remember his revenge and that implies that he will...<br /><br />But you really need to see the movie to appreciate the stunning implication.<br /><br />On another level this is a movie about what makes us human.  What would life be like if we lived in an eternal present without reference to the past?  We could be easily exploited by those with knowledge of the past, as Leonard is, but there is a deeper question being asked.

B000002KKS|4.0|Black Sabbath and Ozzy Osbourne are often synonomous. Yet, with this album the remaining members attempted to show that life can go on even after Ozzy left. HEaven and Hell is an awesome record, displaying that the Sabbath can still rock. It Opens up furiously and never really lets you go - until the end. Hence, four stars. Still, there is no denying the power from the title track and Neon Knights. Dio proves to be a worthy successor to Ozzy, even though he is not as popular. Many fans like to think Sabbath was nothing after 1978. That's not true! A lot of great music came afterwards. Personally, i feel Sabbath's last real album was Born Again, since all of them afterward are basically Iommi Solo Projects (Though good ones at that). It's time to get acquainted with Heaven and Hell. Give it a try! You may be pleasantly surprised!
B00005FHTX|5.0|For my money this is the best Rolling Stones album ever, even if it is really not a typical example of their work. I do not think you can find a better opening to a Stones album than \\"Gimme Shelter\\" with Mary Clayton providing awesome guest vocals to some apocalyptic lyrics.  The catchy guitar lead suggests bad things are coming this way, a sentiment amplified by the high pitched, wordless vocals and the complimentary piano before the rest of the band crashes in and Mick Jagger starts singing.  I also know you can not top \\"You Can't Always Get What You Want\\" as the big finale, what with the London Bach Choir lending their voices (not to mention Al Kooper providing the most memorable French Horn work on a sixties rock 'n' roll album).  I understand the idea that this is the Stones' response to \\"Hey Jude,\\" but it certainly stands on its own as a classic pop tune, which makes it a most atypical Stones song on that grounds alone.  Then there is the philosophical sentiments of the chorus, which again has you double-checking to make sure this is the same Stones who did \\"Sympathy for the Devil\\" and were the acknowledged bad boys of rock 'n' roll.<br /><br />\\"Midnight Rambler,\\" which originally began Side 2 in those days of vinyl, is another one of those most rare long Stones songs and featured Mick Jagger wailing on his harp. \\"Monkey Man\\" is my all time favorite non-Stones hit song with Jagger pointing out \\" I hope we're not too messianic or a trifle too satanic\\" (I used it for a class assignment once as the music background for a Pat Paulsen speech) and \\"Country Honk\\" is a countrified version of their hit \\"Honky Tonk Woman.\\"  You also have a couple of acoustic blues tracks with \\"You Got the Silver,\\" which offers up the first lead vocals by Keith Richards, and a cover of Robert Johnson's \\"Love in Vain.\\"  \\"Live With Me\\" is a solid Stone rocker and the title song is okay, but what is important is that title: it fostered an inherent comparison with \\"Let It Be,\\" but since that was the Beatles' weakest album, the Stones came out ahead on this one.  Those were fun days in rock and roll, boys and girls, let me tell you.<br /><br />Special mention to the efforts of Nicky Hopkins on this album, who plays piano on most of the key tracks as well as the late Brian Jones, who appears on two of the tracks, as does his replacement, Mick Taylor. On top of all that, I love the way the back of the album deconstructs the front. \\"Beggar's Banquet\\" might be the more traditional Rolling Stones album, but \\"Let It Bleed\\" still holds the top spot for me and the last time I put together my Top 10 albums of all time list for my Pop Culture class \\"Let It Bleed\\" was on it. Finally, as it says at the bottom of the liner notes: THIS RECORD SHOULD BE PLAYED LOUD. It should also be played often.at was the Beatles' weakest album, the Stones came out ahead on this one.

B000002H2H|5.0|Well, I think we all know that Master of Puppets is the best Metallica album.  With that said, there are still 4 other Metallica CD's which are more than worthy of 5 stars.  Ride The Lighting is probably number 2 on my list,(Followed by ...And Justice for All, then Kill em' All, then The Black Album). <br /> <br />     This CD contains no filler, no crap, and nothing but the heavy metal rocking that and Metallica fan will tell you is the best.  This is and improvement from Kill em' All (yes an improvement from a 5 Star Album) in that it is much more epic in its musical achievments.  The solos are bigger and the sound is much more infatuating to a metal head.  Even non-headbangers will have a tuff time trying to not like this stuff. <br /> <br />     1)Fight Fire with Fire - What a start.  If there is anything Metallica excels at, it's their ability to start off these songs with such great melodic beginnings and tie them so will into the heavy rock to follow -=8=- <br />     2)Ride the Lightning - One of the greatest thrash metal songs ever made.  Great guitar playing and great singing. -=10=- <br />     3)For Whom the Bell Tolls - Another great rocker.  Great everything. -=9=- <br />     4)Fade to Black - Starts off slow but in no way lacks the punch of Metallica.  GREAT guitar solo by Hammet. -=10=- <br />     5)Trapped Under Ice - Very Very Fast and Very Very Heavy, maybe a little lacking in musical quality and vocals, but still very good. -=8=- <br />     6)Escape - A little slow compared to others(not including Fade) but still heavy and still great. -=9=- <br />     7)Creeping Death - Great Beginning, Great Throughout and very heavy.  A very powerful effort by all band members. -=9=- <br />     8)The Call to Ktulu - Yes... It is an instrumental, but it makes up for the lack of vocals with its great melody and harmony.  It just sounds great and epic.  Great guitar work.     -=10=- <br /> <br />     Overall, It deserves a 95/100.  It contains all elements that make an album great.  Musicians with all the talent in the world that made a great album.  As close to perfect as possible.(or is it...Master of Puppets might just be perfect...). <br /> <br />

B000067J1H|3.0|Lots of violence and bloody gore, but still, this movie had a message somewhere.  I think this is the kind of movie that people either hate of love, so I'm just going to say I enjoyed it but it did drag a bit.<br /><br />I was captivated by the anti-materialist tone of the anti-hero, and although I obviously don't approve of his methods, a lot of what he had to say is true.<br /><br />Some parts were funny, some silly and many bloody and violent, this movie was well acted and I do recommend it to those that like this sort of long winded tirade against modern life.  I wouldn't recommend it as a date movie, and while I enjoyed watching it once, I can't really recommend it as a library film, the I can get the message again without sitting through a long film.
B000000P11|4.0|I had heard that Script of the Bridge was their masterpiece; heard it, found it to be so-so. I much prefer this offering. Burgess has a somewhat abrasive, yet powerful voice that works very well on the more powerful songs. My faves are Mad Jack, Swamp Thing, Childhood, Paradiso, and especially, Tears, In Answer, and Inside Out. The two covers (Bowies John I'm Only Dancing, and Beatles Tomorrow Never Knows) are at best so-so, but I was never a big fan of those two songs anyway (especially Bowies). RIYL, early Echo & the Bunnymen.
B0001BKAEY|2.0|I finally got around to seeing this on dvd.  I saw the original at the movies twice and on tape and dvd many times over.  The second movie was so bad I didn't even go to the theater to see this one.  A shame.<br /><br />I don't know what happened, but perhaps the incredible success of the first left nowhere to go but down.<br /><br />This movie was a cliche with horrible dialogue and a hard to follow plot.  Nothing about the special effects make it worth seeing for just for the sake of seeing them.<br /><br />In any case, I guess, if you are like me, and loved the first movie, and saw the second, you're going to want to see this one.  However, I don't recommend buying it, why should we reward such disregard for the high standard set by the first Matrix film, surely the LTR series didn't do this kind of thing (although the Star Wars series sure did).
B000002J1O|4.0|\\" Can you tell me, where my country lies,<br /><br />  said unifaun with his true love eyes.\\"<br /><br />  Peter Gabriel starts to sing very emonationally on this album first track  called Dancing Out With The Moonlit Knight. This song is almost perfect opening song including beautiful melody, great harmon sounds and carefully played quitars. But the end of this song is too long and booring it uses same quitar melody almost two minutes.<br /><br /> I Know What I Like( In Your Wardrope ) was Genesis first hit single(18#) This short song has very catchy and easy listening chorus. Flute part is my favourite!<br /><br />Firth of Fifht belongs to my Genesis songs top 5 because piano harmon and quitar melodies are so awesome great.<br /><br /> The Cinema Show has its best parts at the end of song. Interesting song that came also one of Genesis's live favourites.<br /><br /> More Fool Me, The Battle of Epping Forest and Aisle of Plenty are three reasons why I can't give this \\"classic album\\" five stars( four and half would be better). I don't like very much Phil Collins voice because its irritates my some way. He is a terrific drummer but not a great singer(in my mind) That's why I don't like More Fool Me what it is also a too simple song.<br /><br />The Battle of Epping Forest is too long, booring and it has not many interesting musical ideas. Aisle of Plenty is a short song that could  have been easily cut off this album because it remains too much Dancing Out With The Moonlit Knight. Melody is almost same.<br /><br /> Finally, Selling England By The Pound has its own good parts and weak lenks but it's worth of having. Maybe some day I will like more of this album but today The Lamb Lies Down On The Broadway, Foxtrot and Nursery Cryme sounds better.
B0001HAISG|5.0|The animated Disney version of Peter Pan was well-liked but I didn't care for the native scenes(by the way, don't you dare say squaw to a native woman, you won't believe how offensive it is). The Spielberg re-telling was a bit too heavy handed with skateboarding, basketball, baseball and a character joining the bad guys subplot that did not work in the film. It was also a bit boring and long. The Hogan re-telling recalls a lot of the Disney version and adding in it's own stuff. <br /> <br />Wendy(Rachel Hurd-Wood in a great debut) is about to grow up and become a lady but wishes not to.  One night, Peter Pan comes looking for his shadow hiding in a drawer. Wendy wakes up to find him and sews it back on. He then teaches her and her 3 brothers to fly and they travel to Neverland where Peter's archnemesis Captain Hook is on a mission to rid Neverland of Peter forever. <br /> <br />There is some changes from the Disney version that's different. The mermaids in Blue Lagoon are actually treacherous and bit threatening to look at instead of the serene Spielberg versions or the nice-but-too-playful Disney ones. Instead of Hook's, well hook attached to his hand very easily, it now is a contraption he must hook up to himself. Hook never knew how to fly and when Pan rescues Tiger Lily, it's in a dungeon/castle like setting rather than a cave. <br /> <br />There is good things. For one it looks spectacular with great effects and shots that seem out of a painting. Jason Isaacs, who was best known for playing villains(Patriot, Harry Potter) gets to play a dual role with Mr. Darling and Hook himself. The debut of Hurd-Wood and not to mention Olivia Williams is still great to look at. All in all, it's a great version of the well-known story that sadly didn't get that much attention when released(it was made for 125 million with advertising and production budget but made 120 worldwide). The box-office is respectable but nowhere near what it should've been.
B00025ETIW|4.0|I saw MCR a few years ago and picked up their first CD. It was enjoyable but paled in comparison to their live show (watching their bass player finish the set with his face covered in blood after splitting his head open with his bass is an image i will never forget.) so when a friend of mine with, ahem, \\"questionable\\" musical tastes told me to check out the new cd, i was more then a bit aprehensive. but i had a night full of unexpectedly good tips and thought, why the hell not. boy am i glad i picked this one up- i wish i would have grabbed it when it was first released. i know a lot of long time fans of the band are pised at the less intense, more produced sound of this album, but i honestly think they have made great strides forward. sure it doesn't have that same fury, but there are bands that should make mcr feel bad for even trying when it comes to raw passion and intensity. what we have here is a clean, melodic collection of emo songs with goth sensibilities. there's a lot of great minor chord progressions jumping into the relative major-gives that nice sense of movement. there isn't anything too interesting going on in the rythm section (then again, this is true of most scremo bands out today- not a problem though, it works :)  ) mainly 4/4 and 6/8 time signatures. still it's highly enjoyable- and this comming from a snobby college kid who rips bands because he is desperately seeking some sense of self as though he were still in high school ;)  give it a try and quit bitching. just because a band learn to play their instruments better and filter out some of the distortion in the studio doesn't mean they cannot be enjoyed
B00028HBKM|4.0|I haven't seen a film that was as much a lightning rod for controversy as this film. People argued it was anti-Semitic. Others: too violent. Others: too focused on one aspect. My teacher's sister saw the film and said that while it was good, there was way more to his life than just this. I'm writing this review as a spiritual person. I'm not Catholic, Buddhist, Muslim or Atheist. Or should I say I'm not solely one or the other. My spirituality is diverse with many branches. And people, it's okay to be catholic hater of this film or an atheist lover of it, but people seem to think you either are catholic and hate it or anything else and love. As for the anti-semitics? Please. <br /> <br />The film chronicles the last 12 hours of Jesus Christ's life according to Mel Gibson so this film isn't a pseudo documentary where every event actually transpired(even if people doubt he actually existed). Anyway, the film starts with Christ being betrayed by Judas in the Garden of Gethsemane. Judas takes off and Christ is captured and others want him desperately to be punished. He's taken to Pontius Pilate, but he won't sentence him, King Herod won't either. But instead of risking a rebellion if Christ is freed, he orders his death by crucifixtion.  <br /> <br />While beautifully shot and some great performances even if you can't understand a word of Aramic or Hebrew, there is some problems. One: there's cases of extremes. The priests who want Christ are SO determined to get him sentenced. The Roman guards come off as extremely sadistic and almost seem to take pleasure with scourging Christ with poles and a vicious-looking cat o'nine tails(it looks like a claw). As for the violence, it is disturbing to a fault. There's a part where one of the claws is caught in Christ's side and is yanked, thereby pulling off some of his flesh. I don't know about you but does that seem necessary after such a brutal torture already? Or how about the 6, count em 6 times Christ falls when carrying hiscross to the hilltop? Although one shot is can certainly be disheartening when Christ, nailed to the cross, has to be turned over but from the look of it, would hit the ground face first with the heavy cross crushing him although he's stopped. Quite an unnerving scene.  The Resurrection scene should definately have been longer also. <br /> <br />The movie does have its strong points though. For one, the score done by John Debney is one to listen to as it's epic and moving. The cinematography by Caleb Daschanel is very well done, the performances, especially by Jim Caviezel(Christ) and Maia Morgenstern(Mary) are quite impressive too. Another, it's a very thought provoking film and stirred up a lot of debate. Don't listen to those ultra right-wing people who say this is a anti-semitic film. Watch and judge for yourself.
B000228WRY|5.0|From what I can understand, the difference is the addition of the song \\"When The Tigers Broke Free\\" that was used in \\"The Wall\\" film. This song is about the death of Roger Waters father in WWII. It's suppose to be different from the version from \\"Echoes.\\"<br /><br />From the \\"Brain Damage\\" website: \\"The reason of this reprint is because the album is now on the EMI label worldwide. Until now, Sony Music owned the rights for North America, Japan, etc... and EMI wanted a new version to celebrate the return to its catalogue. The main change, in this version, is represented by the addition of \\"When The Tigers Broke Free\\". As you know, Tigers was recorded for The Wall film. It was originally destined for The Final Cut album, but at the end it was discharged, it was too much linked to Roger.<br /><br />EMI suggested inserting this song on the reprint of TFC, and both Roger and the band approved it. A copy of the album was done, placing \\"Tigers\\" into the sequence in four different points to find the best place. Finally the copy was sent to Roger and he decided. We then did a new mix of the song, starting from 16-track tapes of the film soundtrack (a different mix from the \\"Echoes\\" one) and we inserted it into the sequence using a cross-fading effect. The other mixes are the originals.<br /><br />We mastered all starting from original analogue tapes, using a special machine built by Tim de Paravicini. It used a valve EQ (by Tim too), linked to a \\"Gold Series\\" A/D converter from Dan Lavry Engineering. The album was compiled in SADiE. This version of The Final Cut has the best sound it ever has had on CD...\\"<br /><br />The link: [...]<br /><br />This is my favorite PF album. I loved the way Roger sang on it. I will buy this version when I get some money. I hope this helps.
0393307050|4.0|I was lent this book by a friend and struggled to get into it.  `Not my type of book I thought' but I persevered and by the end of book two, Post Captain I was well and truly hooked.  The period writing is stunning in it's realism, the characters with all their human traits and failings are so real you feel that he is writing about people that actually extisted.  I used to eagerly await each book and was really diappointed when I finally came to the last page of the last book.  I plan on buying my own set of the Aubrey-Maturin books and to start reading them all over again.  If you struggle with the first book - do yourself a favour and stick with it.
0140277447|5.0|This is an Excellent book, that gives us the full details of one of the MOST horrible crime happened in the history of mankind; especially to women and children.  The Japanese military war crime committed in China during WWII was so insane that, I think  it is a responsibility for everyone to know about it.  Hopefully,   people will not forget about this mistake, and will prevent it from happening again in the future.      The problem is that, the Rape of Nanking was generally ignored by the Western World, and most people don't know enough about this \\"Forgotten Holocaust\\" to help educating people the importance of this tragedy.     Just do a research on the internet with \\"Nanking 1937\\", people can find many related pictures that can give people a general feeling of how horrible the crime was.  In the Ms Iris Chan's book, people then can find out the detials and how this \\"Forgotten Holocaust\\" happened.  A highly recommended book.
0064407667|5.0|In the first book in the Series of Unfortunate Events, we meet the Baudelaires, who seemed to be followed by trouble after they're parents are killed in a fire.  They are then placed in the hands of the villian, Count Olaf, who is constantly trying to get his hands on the fortune the Baudelaire parents left behind.  Read about the elaborate plan that Olaf has cooked up in this installment of the series.  I feel that I must describe each charater since this is the first book. <br /> <br />Violet Baudelaire- the eldest Baudelaire-I beleive 14 in this book- who is quiet possibly the best inventor in her age group ever. <br /> <br />Klaus Baudelaire- the middle Baudelaire and a great researcher and bookworm. <br /> <br />Sunny Baudelaire- The youngest of the Baudelaires(a toddler) who has four very large teeth that enjoy to bite. <br /> <br />Count Olaf- the criminal and actor who, along with his theater troupe, terrorize the Baudelaires throughout the seies.  He seems to have an unhealthy interest in eyes. Are they even eyes? Hmm... <br /> <br />Mr. Poe- Th banker in charge of the orphans affairs.  He is always in need of a tissue. <br /> <br />If you think the kindly judge next door is going to save the orphans and live happily ever after you are wrong. In fact, no adult helps the orphans at all in the series so far.
B00028HBL6|4.0|It is fascinating that the Christian and Jewish surnames of the reviewers of this movie differ categorically, i.e., if you are a Christian, it's great; if you are a Jew, it's a \\"snuff film for Christians,\\" it's \\"anti-jew and blames us for killing God\\", etc. <br /> <br />Gibson has made several violent and graphic films, such as Mad Max, Braveheart, The Man Without a Face, Ransom, Conspiracy Theory, etc.  Why expect anything different from The Passion? <br /> <br />The guy is very creative and has his own style.  Leave him alone and let him make movies. He tells it as he comprehends and envisions it, not as a progenitor of this or that politic. <br /> <br />To miss this film because of rhetoric would be a shame.  It's a very good film about a profoundly extraordinary individual who changed the world by sacrificing himself.  Whether you believe him to be the son of God or not, you've got to admire his Chutzpah! <br /> <br />Lighten up, everybody!  It's a MOVIE!
B00028HBKM|1.0|I have recieved a lot of hate mail from Christians about my review of the Passion.  Instead of responding to them all individually I have decided to reply in the reivew.  As such I want to state that I have read both the articles in Time and News Week.  Articles that point out the anti-semantic over tones of this film.         I find it ironic that scine I have a different opinion of this film, no one is saying this review is helpful.  I just feel that it is my duty to point out that this film tends to make the Jews out to be the bad guys.  In fact this filmed was banned over seas, in the fear that it may start a riot against the local Jewish populations.    My review once again:         Once again it is frightening to see that a number one movie would be so closely tied into religion.  After all aren't Americans supposed to be tolerant of all faiths, not just their  particular view.    Either way this movie scared me since it feels like a call to arms against both the Jews and the Arabs.  A very anti-semantic movie that earned world wide aclaim.  What is this world comming to?    Safe travels:  -David
B00003CXCT|5.0|Man are all the reviewers that need to trash George Lucas for trying to improve his classic film so wrong. How can one of the greatest film series ever made be completey ruined because a character somehow manges to get a shot off before he was killed by the hero. HOW DOES THAT RUIN A MOVIE? You can think the scene is not what you remember but it will not ruin the movie. Hate the Jsbba scene well How about you hit your next chapter key and skip the scene entirely its not like the scene was there to begin with. How can you call yourself a fan if you are not really ready to accept the changes the creator makes. And as far as Hayden at the end of Jedi. Nobody has seen Episode 3 yet. Maybe it would not make sense to have Sebastian Shaw there once the Jedi ressurection technique is revealed. No wonder George Lucas does not want to make episode 7-9. He is probaly afraid his fans will get even angrier. If more people showed support instead of anger maybe that would encourage George to reunite the original cast for one last great hurrah. You all talk about George going to the Dark Side with greed what about your own anger have you learned nothing watching these movies. So if you do not want to enjoy the best looking, sounding and improved FX (Everyone like to criticise Jabba in ANH but no one praises the much better looking attack on the Death Star. Come on anyone care to complain about that?)becuse you do not have the coping skills for the few minutes of changes made then you have a problem. Me I can not wait and when I am watching the trench run from ANH or Vader's revelation from ESB or the attack of the Death Star from ROJ. I will not be thinking of anyone who trashes George and his grand trilogy. I will be enjoying some great films. They can enjoy it the way the have for the past 20 years on a VCR.
B00005JNEI|4.0|I found this film quite good. While the facts may be a bit scattered and loose it does its job by appealling to a wide audience. I reccomend you read John Pilgers 'The New Rulers of the World' for a full blown account of whats really going on. Then you would think twice about voting for the Bush Administration. The fact remains that the Bush Administration lied to its people for invading Iraq thus in its wake killing thousands of innocenct Iraqi civilions and for what cause??????? <br />Oil
B00003CXCT|5.0|Do you really care if Greedo shot first? Do you really care about the cgi changes or if a young Annikin is inserted in the finale? Do you? May God help you. There are other things to worry yourself with...losing wieght, getting friends, going out of your house and experiencing all the good things this world has to offer. I for one am going to enjoy the DVD edition of Star Wars. And enjoy it for what they are. And what is that you ask? George Lucas himself couldn't say it better...\\"They are only movies.\\"
1594200106|4.0|OK--if I was evaluating a thriller or a mystery, I would definitely give this book 5 stars.  but it seems taht the book has greater pretentions--or at least some of the readers think so.  While very well written and involved, with fully developed characters, atmosphere and historical background The Shadow of the Wind cannpt be compared to \\"A Hundred Year of Solitude.\\" The melodrama and the stereotypical characters as well as the somewhat flat historical context separate this very interesting novel from teh masterpiece.<br /><br />If I have to compare it to another novel, the Shadow of the Wind reminded me of the Count of Monte Christo--with its coincidences, characters obsessed with revenge or treasure, villains and damsels devoted to unrequitted love.
0790730960|1.0|This has to be the worst Batman movie ever made, if not the worst movie period. Clown gangsters, suicide penguin bombers, a giant rubber duck with tank wheels, how much worse can it get? Much, much worse. A terrible, almost nonexistent, storyline, bad special effects. I can't even begin to explain the downright stupidity of this movie. Do not waste your time or your money.
B00003CXCT|1.0|Who cares if Greedo shoots first? I DO. I was around when Star Wars was originally released and I want the originals that captivated my generation. The additions of the special editions are annoyances at best in all three but especially in Star Wars with not only the infamous Greedo scene but also a newly installed Boba Fett mugging for the camera. It would have only been worse if he had waved and said \\"look at me\\". THE HOLY GRAIL OF DVD HAS YET TO BE FOUND!!
B0002EXH54|5.0|This is amazing! This is exactly how this cd should sound. <br />The remix and remastering make this cd sound SO MUCH better than the original. <br />I'm very glad I bought it. <br />I only really get into the first three Megadeth albums, and my favorite is Killing is my business...,so I wasn't sure I wanted to buy Peace sells... & So far so good...(because I have the old cds),but I bought Peace sells... and now I have to buy So Far So Good..., because the remixes and remastering make them sound a hundred times better!!!! <br />Listen to them and compare the difference(esp. in the drums) <br />I wish Gar Samuelson could hear this remix, I'm sure he would love it! He was Amazing and very underrated. And SO much better than Lars. <br />

IT'S THE FIRST ONE I WOULD SUGGEST! <br />There is also someone who says that you shouldn't buy the remastered/remixed version because it doesn't add anything?!? <br />WHAT? <br />CAN YOU NOT HEAR THE DIFFERENCE IN THE DRUMS? <br />YOU CAN FINALLY HEAR EVERYTHING CLEARLY! <br />This is THE  best megadeth album.  <br />If you haven't bought it...buy it <br />If you haven't heard it...buy it! <br />If you think there isn't different from the original cd release...buy it and compare it, because there is! <br />I bet the people who said \\"Killing is my business...\\" isn't better now that it's remixed, listened only to the 30second samples and not an actual cd. <br />It's too bad Gar Samuelson isn't alive to hear what these recordings sound like today. He was amazing! <br />

B00005JMAH|5.0|The first HP movie was strong, and had to introduce Rowling's world, the characters, and essential tensions. The second movie flagged, and was limp and burdened by details. This movie sets a tone that the rest will need -- fast-paced, necessary ellisions, a movie that feels like a movie, not a book on screen. The pacing is excellent, the effects great, and you're whisked along from beginning to end. Much better acting, and Lupin is great. A pleasant surprise!

0553288105|5.0|On the surface, the book is about the issues relating from a seemingly free energy source taken from three points of view:  Some Earthbound scientists, an alien trio from a parallel universe, and a Moonbound scientist and intuitionist.  The book is written in three large chapters, containing each point of view. <br /> <br />Throughout the story, many issues are implied above and beyond the science fiction at hand.  Left brain/right brain difference are covered in the alien interactions.  The morality of putting one species over another is touched upon.  The difficulty of replacing an energy source are touched on - Asimov could have been predicting the oil crisis and resultant pollution impacts.  <br /> <br />At times when reading this book, I really felt, \\"So this is what a truly great writer is about...\\"  The prose was fantastic, the weaving of the three story lines was fine craftmanship, and the meaning broader than just the surface plot.  In many ways Asimov transcends the genre of science fiction in this amazing story.

B00028HBKM|4.0|Of course it is! it's the story of the son of God, so obviously it's not for little kiddies,people into heavy metal and rap or Executive producers. The story was good, although, I did feel Gibson did exploit the religious congregation a bit, just to make a lot of money (unexpectedly?); which just means, he's a normal Catholic man - just kidding dude, I liked the film. It was brutally honest - and if you're going by the bible, historically accurate. I much point out, that the whole story is in Hebrew, so if you're going to watch it, get the bifocals out to see the subtitles!
B000002MUN|5.0|I can't remember the first time I heard Tom Petty's 'Wildflowers'.  I can't remember if I even liked it..(Considering I was but a lad at the time..)  What with hard hitting bands like The Deftones, The Offspring, and Korn achieving their peak of popularity during my high school years; one would not consider 'Wildflowers' to be amongst my favorite albums.  But this impressive mix of music and emotion was always able to creep into my top 10.   <br />Tom Petty is definately at his finest in this collection of tunes, which I believe to be one of his most overlooked and underrated albums.   <br />A high recommendation from me.
B00020HEG6|4.0|After seeing the movie I was very interested in getting the soundtrack.  I am not disappointed by the musical score at all and think it is wonderful.  I listen to it almost every day at work.  I was a little disappointed by the \\"enhanced\\" portions of the CD, in particular the screen saver.  I know this is just the \\"icing\\" so to speak but it was the final selling point to me as I do not customarily spend quite so much on a soundtrack.  The screen saver could have been much better.  It is very brief and the most interesting thing was Hedwig turning her head.  I hope that for the \\"Goblet of Fire\\" if they sell an enhanced CD that they add the enhancements on as more than just an afterthought, which is what this seemed to be like.
B0000C9ZLD|3.0|First of all I have to make clear that I have not been influenced by any hype surrounding The Strokes. I picked this album up along with \\"is this it\\" within one week of each other and had not ever heard a single track, or read a single article, nor had I heard a single thing about either of them. I ran across Franz Ferdiand just prior to buying both and really got into it. The Strokes were reffered to as being similar- so I went for it. \\"Is this it\\" is wicked! So much fun to listen to and very catchy and somewhat raw. \\"Room on Fire\\" is very, well, ordinary. Granted, these are two very different efforts. But between the two \\"is this it\\" is much much better! Again, I picked these up at about the same time. So this is not a review of a 'dissapointing second effort' but rather it is simply a review of which album is better...
B0000033P0|4.0|Now THIS is the ELP I loved, adventurous, risk-taking and ferocious, just like a panther being let out of the cage.  <br /> <br />\\"Tarkus\\" was brilliantly written, the sections flow together beautifully, plus it's Bartok-like dissonance is in just the right amounts for this Owl. I just can't get enough of that growly Hammond organ!  <br /> <br />The remainder of the album is largely good, save for the rather lame attempts at humor (\\"Jeremy Bender\\" and \\"Are You Ready Eddy?\\"), something ELP were never particularly good at. As long as they stuck to the serious stuff they were golden for the most part.  <br /> <br />Buy this one just for Tarkus alone, what a good prog-rock epic should be.
B00005QIPH|5.0|I am only giving it 5 because I think the reviews from some people are unfairly and excessively biased in the other direction. This album is good- very good. I know this because I listened to it not knowing anything about the Strokes. I didn't know how 'cool' they were. I had no idea how hip it is to be a Strokes groupie. I had never heard any hype about them. The only reason I knew them is because I had heard that they are similar to Franz Ferdinand which I had heard at a small local record shop and dug as well. So when I listened to 'Is this it' by The Strokes I had no biases and had only my instincts to trust about whether or not it was good music. And my instincts told me it was good- very good. I think a lot of people that are making derogatory comments about the album are making it for all the wrong reasons. They are reacting to the hype and not actually listening to the music. SO the question you have to ask yourself is this. Do you listen to a band because it is all the rage, or do you listen to it because it you actually like it?
0385512104|5.0|I really enjoyed this book, although I will have to agree with the people here who said that the main character was trying at times! I felt for him and his struggles to deal with and understand the world, but I also felt for his family and their struggles to understand and deal with him! It did a good job of showing us Christopher's life realistically, warts and all. <br /> <br />I also have to agree that this book, while entertaining, was written by a non-autistic person and was not meant to be a definitive look at how autistic people think or see the world (because really, no one can know that for sure), just one author's idea of what that might be like.    <br /> <br />Some very funny moments, some very sad moments, and overall uplifting.
0446310786|5.0|Around 1962, when I was a little kid, my aunt read this book.  I saw the title and (in the self-righteous way only the very young have) pointed out how awful it was to have a book about killing mockingbirds.  I believe she commented that the book made that very point.    Ten years later I read the book myself.  And have done so several times since.  Once I read it while I was traveling in Germany, and was touched all the more since it is such a quintessentially American book.  A striking juxtaposition to read about the rural south of the 1930's while staying in the modern Berlin of the 1990's.    I grew up in the middle of California's San Joaquin valley - a flat expanse of fertile agricultural land.  We lived on the edge of the country-side with a cotton field bordering our backyard.  There were no sidewalks.  The summer days were hot and the heat carried over long into the evening.  And the kids of the neighborhood had a freedom to roam that would not be even considered today.  There was a house down the street that we were sure was inhabited by witches.  We braved it on Halloween, but threw away the candy lest it be tainted.    Harper Lee portrayed childhood in such an adept way that the games, fantasies and structure of imagination the children built are as familiar to a California girl today as they are to a child in Alabama in the middle of the depression.  I could identify with everything those children did, thought and said.  It is through a child's eye that the far more serious subject matter of the book is related.    So many things have stuck with me over the years.  Not just the central tragedy of Tom Robinson and the Ewell's. The familiarity of a school pageant.  The struggle to adapt to teachers who don't understand the cultural nuances of the class.  A heroic effort to overcome addiction as a matter of self and principle.  Sultry summer evenings.  Walking like an Egyptian.  The price one pays to learn and acquire values.  Trying to make Boo Radley come out.  Dill.  Calpurnia.  And, of course, Atticus.    I was always sorry that Harper Lee didn't write more.  Then I realized that she didn't need to.  She'd written a perfect book.
B00003CXQY|5.0|This may be my favorite Disney movie ever. (I normally prefer Pixar.) <br /> <br />The reviewers who did not like it clearly expected something for small kids. It is not. It is very abstract in places, especially the art, which is really quite amazing. Watch for the design of the panthers, and the bats. And the landscapes. Wonderful stuff.  <br /> <br />And the dialogue and the delivery especially is just hilarious. How you can get such delivery in an animated film is beyond me.  <br /> <br />Warmly recommended for mature viewers with an edgy sense of humor.
0345363132|5.0|History is full of examples of the scramble to the winning side - especially when the consequences of being on the wrong side are often fatal.  When Henry Tudor's troops killed Richard III at the battle of Bosworth Field, it was in no one's interest to align themselves with the Plantagenets.  The king was dead, long live the king.    And Richard was a monster, anyway.  Wasn't he?  The evil uncle.  The scheming hunchback who killed his innocent nephews.  A vile man who was involved in the murder of the saintly Henry VI.  Who was involved in his brother George's unfortunate encounter with the vat of malmsey wine.  A villain for the ages.    We have only to reconcile this with other information.  He led the vanguard of great armies.  Not usual for a crippled crookback.  He was entrusted by his brother with the rule of the whole of the north of England.  His personal motto was \\"Loyalty Binds Me\\".    And when he died, when it was certainly not in their interest to do so, the City of York read into the council minutes: \\"King Richard late mercifully reigning upon us was thrugh grete treason...piteously slane and murdred to the grete hevynesse of this citie...\\"    Sharon Penman's The Sunne in Splendour gives us an alternative reading of this history.  After all, history is written by the victor.  Henry Tudor was the victor and had no love of the previous reign.
B0001BKAEY|1.0|This movie is absolutely horrible. I've seen it about 10 times, so I know what I'm talking about. As a matter of fact, all three of these movies are horrible. None of them are enjoyable to watch. The special effects are so 1980s. I can't believe some dorks like this movie. This is quite possibly the worst trilogy of all time. Right behind Star Wars. I would give it zero stars if I could. <br /> <br />Pick up the \\"Back To The Future\\" trilogy instead. The special effects in THIS trilogy will blow your mind.
0380977788|5.0|Prepare to be disturbed by this book...by the Other Mother, among many other twisted characters and ideas.  Coraline goes into an alternate plane as visceral and strange as Baum's Oz or Carroll's Wonderland.  The underlying whispers and ominous sentience are scary enough as Coraline bravely traverses this new place, so oddly similar to her own world.   <br />But the visuals...if I had been under 10 and read this book, I surely would have had nightmares for weeks.  Your imagination will prove quite potent while you read this. <br />The art is great too...a bonus and quite representative of the feel of the story.   <br />Highly recommended.
B00003CXCT|1.0|I just watched all of the \\"special\\" editions of the STAR WARS triliogy.  They suck.  The additions to the films are distracting, stupid, lame, and offensive!  Does the origional voice actor for Boba-Fet know his voice is gone?  What about the origional actor for Anikan...he is gone and replaced with Hayden Christensin!!  Lucas did not direct \\"Return\\" and \\"Empire\\" he owns them in purley legal terms.  I know...I'll buy the Beatles songs and use them in commercials!  People hated that.  I'll buy MGM Classics and colorize them!!  Ted Turner was a fool.  One day (even if it is after Lucas is dead) the REAL triliogy will be released and these will be forgotten like the colorized Three Stooges Georgie himself hated so much.  Oh and the DVD transfers are terrible!!  colors too bright and the blacks are way too deep like the contrast and color being off on your TV.  This dvd set gets No Stars if that was possible.
B000286S8S|4.0|Finally they got it right. Such a vast, no, make that monumental improvement over Greatest Hits Volume 1. All the hits are on this album, thats not on GHV1. Pretty Woman, Finish What Ya Started exc. I would have liked to see Without You from the Gary Schrone era represented here, but beggers cant be choosers. Also the live tracks are a great flashback, to VH in their heyday. but if it was my album to pick and choose I would go with the before mentioned Without You, Me Wise Magic from GHV1. and Cabo Wabo from OU812. But given the animostity between VH and David Lee Roth, I Can see why Me Wise Magic wasnt included, Come On their isn't one Pic of Dave in the whole Liner Notes. <br />SUMMATION: Get it, no dont think, GET IT NOW, its definalty worth the buy.
B000244EME|4.0|I love this movie, always have. It's an exciting and  original science fiction movie. It's about soldiors, lead by Arnold who while on a mission in a jungle accounter a dangerous alien creature that hunts for skulls. The movie is gory and violent but it's also  always fun and entertaining. Arnold I think was at the top of his game here too, acting wise I mean if you can believe that lol.  The director John McTiernan  was at the top of his game as well. This is his best movie I think next to Die Hard and the Hunt for Red October. Although Arnold and McTiernan  do well, the movie wouldn't have been as good if the Predator itself wasn't so damn cool.
0743243307|2.0|At the outset, I was drawn in by the mythological quality of the story of Nazneen's birth. The question that it put forward - should a person be left to their fate? - was a meaningful and intriguing one. I was interested in the kind of impact her mother's unusual philosophy would have on Nazneen. However, I was never satisfied by the book's attempts to reveal the inner workings of its characters. The book disappointed me with its predictability and shallowness. The setting the characters were placed in, and the texture of the characters themselves had a lot of potential, but it was never realized. The book gave me some insight into what felt like the stereotypes of Bangladeshi, immigrant culture (gossiping housewives, confused children, and emasculated, insecure men), without providing an honest, gritty perspective on it. Nazneen never leaped off the page; she remained weak, simple, and unsympathetic. Ali's depiction of Nazneen and her sister, Hasina, came off as contrived and one-dimensional. I could feel Ali trying to depict Hasina and Nazneen's desperate situations instead of feeling the characters' plight. This is demonstrated in the way that Hasina's letters were written in bad grammar; Ali was surely trying to make Hasina more pitiable and accurately portray her circumstances, but it ended up sounding formulated and clich. Ali could've depicted both Chanu and Nazneen as complex, multifaceted people, but she didn't. I wanted to see Nazneen's weakness as well as her strength, her predictability and her inconsistency. Ali's vivid and simple style of writing and portraying made the characters appear unreal and made me unable to relate to them. Ali painted a clear picture of Nazneen as a meek, dissatisfied housewife, and Chanu as a slovenly, insecure failure. Even though I understood the characters, I only understood them because they were stereotypes, not because they became real to me. The ending of the book, which ties in Nazneen's fascination with ice-skatingthat's mentioned in the beginning, confirmed my classification of the book as trite and banal. Everything had fallen into place perfectly by the end, with no interesting ambiguities remaining. The image I was left with, Nazneen sailing across the ice without a care in the world, was reminiscent of a bad Julia Roberts movie, and evoked no feeling in me. Overall, the book only touched the surface of it's subject and failed to engage me emotionally or intellectually.
B000000OAN|5.0|I was very excited to recieve this album. I already had it on LP but I liked it so much that I decided to purchase it as a cd so I can listen to it everywhere I go! Not only is the greatest song ever written on this cd(Bohemian Rhapsody), but others as well. I just love \\"Lazing on a Sunday afternoon\\" and \\"Seaside Rendeavous\\". They are so perky and upbeat and I can imagine that Freddie had fun writing them. Not much of a fan of \\"I'm in love with my car\\". And my favorite song off of this album is definetly \\"Love of my Life\\". Go out and get this, you will not regret it!
B00003CXCT|4.0|Some people say that the special editions ruined Star Wars.  Well I thought they were great.  Maybe it is because I was a teenager when I saw them but I like them.  While it would be nice to have the originals on dvd, i probably would rarely watch them.  Since I bought the special edition on vhs I haven't watched my copies of the originals.  I just like the new ones better.  I suspect it will be the same with the dvds.  Star Wars is awesome, and I am sure the dvds will be great.
0440237688|1.0|I read this book for a school prodject and i hated it it was okay at parts but most of the time it was long boring and draged on about things that had nothing to do with the plot at all. this book is very slow I would not recomend it
B000002KAT|5.0|I must completely disagree with any of the reviewers that state that this album is a bore or deserving of less than four stars. I would only give it four stars if this is not your \\"type\\" of music but respect for what Van Morrison has done on this album commands at least those four. My appreciation of and love for this album give it the extra five. One needs to listen to this album at least 4 - 5 times before a judgement can be passed. The lyrics are as deep and complex in their many meanings as any of the best Dylan, Hendrix, or Gaye lyrics. The hint of gospel interpreted by an Irishman is a joy to hear. This is an album of orchestral accompaniment that might turn some off. Most (and most is probably too mild) will appreciate the banter between Morrison and the violin on Madame George or the flute accompaniment on other tracks. I truly feel that this is one of those albums that allow one to reflect in solitude. You would never play this at a party (nor should you), but at the end of a day with your loved one, or during a long car ride, romantic dinner, or whenever the mood calls for reflection, I find it difficult to think of another album to play. <br /> <br />Don't disrepect this work with talk of boringness or lack of enrgy. I doubt that that was the intent and out of reverence, it should be given an intent ear before passing final judgement.
B00028HBKC|1.0|This movie was nothing more than a snuff film for christians.  Finally, those that persecute Hollywood for the violence and sex in movies have a vehicle for their prurient interests.  There was no story line other than watching someone be tortured to death.  If you want to see a good violent movie buy 28 Days Later, it was a lot more compelling.  Mel Gibson has totally lost his mind.
B00026YO36|5.0|great album.consistent all the way through. diverse yet free flowing, and great arrangement of songs and use of guest artists(esp. cris goss and pj harvey). don't forget preceeding e.p. \\"here comes that weird chill\\".
B00008CLOA|5.0|This being my first Pink Floyd CD to have heard, I can say it is probably one of the best CD's ever recorded. By anyone. The only other exception could be Wish You Were Here, also by Floyd. (Do you see a theme here?) <br /> <br />I think the songs are brilliant. I first heard DSOTM about two weeks ago, myself being in my first semester in college. I have been a fan of classic rock, yet I never got into Floyd for some reason that is beyond me. I listened to the CD with optimism, to see what the hub-bub was all about. I was blown away. Although the production is nothing spectacular for me, living in the age of computer produced music, I can see how groundbreaking the effects were, such as in the intro to \\"Money\\". <br />My only beef, and this is something that is apparent throughout all of Pink Floyd's material, is the delays. Tracks like \\"On the Run\\" take away from the actual songs that I want to listen to. The intro to \\"Time\\" is impressive, yet I am hard pressed not to skip ahead to the actual singing, which I enjoy Waters' voice very much in the CD.  <br />Some key tracks, if you had to pick favorites, are Time, Us and Them, Brain Damage and Speak to Me/Breathe. <br /> <br />I hope if you haven't heard this amazing recording, that you do so immediately after reading this review. And after listening to Dark Side, go buy their other CD's - they are all wonderful! You've heard the songs on the radio, now go experience them as they should be listened to! Go out and buy Wish You Were Here, The Wall and Medley right away!
B000000I0I|5.0|This is probably the best Oldfield album. I put Ommadawn among the greatest pieces of music ever made. I've never heard a tune that is so carefully worked upon through the entire piece. The theme that Ommadawn starts with is the most haunting melody I have ever heard. It's dark and bright at the same time, frightening and aerial, as it gives you shivers of ecstasy when you hear it. The composition is brilliant, compelling, craftful. Puts Oldfield among the greatest composers born A.D. Its base concepts are so simple, yet Oldfield builds unspeakable beauty upon them.  <br />There are, certainly, people that won't like this music. It's a matter of listening to nearly every kind of music to appreciate it, maybe. Or maybe it will be more than decades when people will understand that they still find this music new.
B00005JMH2|4.0|Mayasuki Suo's direction in the movie was very risky but came out pretty good <br />in the end throughout the whole flick. <br /> <br />Close-up camera shots of travelling ballroom dancers--especially in International Standard competitions, where they usually <br />go around the room in a closed hold--are hard to keep steady. The camera shots in that movie, however, <br />were pretty good and when you see a dance couple dance <br />around the room in the movie's dance rehearsals and dance  <br />competitions, most of the time, I feel like I am dancing with them. The result <br />was a pretty good visual feeling. <br /> <br />The amateur dance competition scene was, to me, an opening to how the Japanese are starting to embrace dancesport. The paso doble dance music seemed like a samba to me. It was the best of both worlds, <br />even though the dancers were doing paso doble only. The International rumba dance looked like almost any other International rumba dance in other dancesport venues--displays <br />of love and hate, and spectacular poses and picture lines that <br />flourish the basic steps, since rumba is commonly known as the <br />dance of love. <br /> <br />The movie also shows the personal side of the ballroom dance <br />teacher who had been \\"dancesporting\\" in Blackpool. Tamiyo Kusakari (who played Mai Kishikawa) seems to bring the serious side to dancesport with her encounter Koji Yakusho (who played Shohei Sugiyama), especially when Mai  <br />tutored Koji before the big amateur competition.  <br /> <br />Naoko Takenaka (who played Tomio Aoki) had a cariacature almost <br />similar to Scott Hastings (played by Paul Mercurio) in the <br />1993 Austrailian film \\"Strictly Ballroom. Like Hastings, Aoki had a strong <br />desire to go over the edge, be very ostentatious in his arm <br />stylings and body movements, and go for the most ultimate passion--especially when the rumba is involved. <br /> <br />The flashbacks of Mai's experience in the Blackpool championships were also  <br />effective because sometimes, when you are in the grip of the excitement and adventure of ballroom dance, you want to <br />get back to dancing when something dosen't go your way.  <br /> <br />The camera shots of Blackpool outside its traditional championship ballroom floor was a little unique because you see Blackpool from the outside as well on the inside.
B000059XXZ|5.0|Batman Forever and Batman & Robin sucked. Batman and Batman Returns are the greatest! This one I thought was the best. Two-Face used to be my favorite villain. But I switched to Joker when I saw this one. Batman, Spider-Man, and Spawn are my favorite heroes but out of all of them I like Batman. They said they were going to make a #5 but it won't come out until 2004 or 2005. I just hope they make it quick.
B00005Y6YB|5.0|A few years ago I had the opportunity to speak personally with Robert Urich about his role as the ill-fated Jake Spoon in the epic western LONESOME DOVE. Simply put, he said that it was \\"the most fun I have ever had making a movie. Think of it. Riding and shooting every day with two of the greatest western stars ever: Robert Duvall and Tommy Lee Jones! I won't have that much fun ever again.\\" Urich then added,\\"It is probably the greatest western ever!\\" I am sure that he could have gone on for hours but, unfortunately, time would not permit. The look on his face and the light in his eyes said it all. Tragically Urich passed away a year or two thereafter.<br /><br />But, thinking back, I agree wholeheartedly with Urich's assessment of LONESOME DOVE.<br /><br />The legend and the story live on in the Pulitzer Prize winning book by Larry McMurty and in this faithful video depiction of the classic story.<br /><br />A star-studded cast, headed by Duvall, Jones and Urich, along with one of the most beautiful western soundtracks ever composed make LONESOME DOVE a viewing experience that you will enjoy time and again.<br /><br />THE HORSEMAN
0805066691|5.0|I read this when it was first published and recently reread it.  This is THE book to start with it if you have an interest in Native American History or only intend to read one.  It is interesting and heartbreaking.  I reread this book and think of all the crises that have transpired since this book was initially published...Serbia, Rawanda, Sudan, etc. etc. and etc.  We never seem to tire of destroying one another.  Anyway, once you have read this book I would also recommend Trail of Tears and Chief Joseph's I will fight no more forever.  And while you are at it take a look at some of the vintage photographs of Native Americans taken by Edward Curtis.
B000001ELB|4.0|This is the first \\"Greatest Hits\\" record to come out.  In years there will be a looooooooot to come.  Well, this is not bad. The songs included are really hits and no fillers. I can't say either that there \\"left outs\\"(maybe Nothin' to Loose).  In fact, if you are looking for a compilation on the first five years of the band this is the CD to get.<br /><br />The outstanding fact on this one, is the package. WOW! It was great.  I remember buying it for the first time (of course, I mean album record not CD) The whole concept was really superb and, if you consider that, in those years the presentation of the albums was really poor, this was like a big step.<br /><br />Over the years, this one was kind of forgotten because there will be so much to come.  Remember this, now you have Deuce, Cold Gin, Detroit Rock City, Rock'n'Roll all Nite 3 times (The original version, the live version and this) This is important so you can keep scoring CD's.<br /><br />Highlights: The presentation.<br /><br />Lowlights: Strutter '78 (Just forget this version).
B0002IQNAG|5.0|OK-I no longer have a clue what the hell is going on with Anchor Bay. They are so hit and miss that I can't even keep up with them anymore. They act like this is the ONLY movie in their vaults and treat it like George Lucas editing on a bad day. I have now 3 Anchor Bay versions of this film and really don't need anymore. They spend all their time on this film,releasing it,pulling it,releasing it,pulling it. If it wasn't put out so half-assed in the first couple of runs then they wouldn't have to do any more releases. In my opinion YES the box set is enough to be the DEFINITIVE collection. If you don't own any version of this film then YES please pick this up. If your like me then WHY do you need to plunck down more loot for a film I have in one form or the other.Anchor Bay has continually drop the ball and from what I heard had one of the Fn execs on the commentary???why??what did you have to do with this film whatsoever???Anchor Bay has a great catalog but they act like some stupid rich kid who doesnt want to share. Im going to PASS on this set. If you already picked up the theatrical DTS version that Anchor Bay released back in MArch/April then your set. Have a nice day...
B0001Z37HM|2.0|Unlike the Conan movies, this film is very cheesy watching in the year 2004.  The customes are so dated it's hysterical.  Arnold puts more drama and romance into his character than action and Brigette is well, very sexy, but not as strong as Conan the Destroyer and not even compariable to The barbarian. <br />I liked this when I was 12 years old back in 1985, but being in my 30's now this movie brings back memories as to why did I like this movie in the first place!
1401300901|4.0|I bought this book on a whim a few minutes before I was boarding a train for a long ride.  I almost put the book back when I noticed that not only was the author only 22, she also was the Irish PM's daughter (I figured it must have been connections that got an author published so young).  While that may be true, those would-be connections only succeeded at exposing a deserving, talented author.  The book was very funny and witty -- there were times when I was visibly laughing, hoping that my fellow train passengers didn't think I was too strange.  Especially funny was the first scene involving the hairdresser. The book was also touching in its depiction of the love between the main character and her departed husband.  Ahern even showed the irrational but oh-so-true insecurities that find their way into many relationships -- questioning the other person's true thoughts about oneself.  As far as critiquing goes, I felt like Ahern lost some of her comedic steam as the book went on; also, even the funniest parts weren't so original (but they WERE funny).  Lastly, perhaps it is just me (and I have never been in such a situation, so I can't say for sure), but the husband ending each letter with \\"PS I love you\\" seemed more cheesy than touching, especially for how witty the characters were.  All in all, I really enjoyed the book; and though it is not destined to be a classic, I have and will continue to suggest it to selected people. I look forward to reading more of Ahern's work.  Oh, and I would suggest the hardcover edition -- at over 400 pages, the paperback was quite cumbersome!
B000002OAZ|4.0|After the success of Muddy Waters' [[ASIN:B00005R8GU Fathers and Sons]] album, Chess Records decided to do something similar with Howlin' Wolf.  So, they got young rock stars like Eric Clapton, Steve Winwood, Bill Wyman and Charlie Watts to record with Wolf.  The results were good, although not as good as Wolf's older recordings.  Practically all of these songs had been recorded by Wolf before, in better versions.  Wolf's voice was not quite as strong as it once was, and the younger musicians didn't quite mesh with Wolf as well as the old bluesmen he usually worked with did.  But this is still an enjoyable album that blues fans should enjoy.
B00004VVND|5.0|WESTWORLD was far ahead of it's time. Michael Crichton directed this movie years before his Jurassic Park book / movies existed. The whole idea of an amusement park where the attractions go berserk was done in WW in the dark ages of 1973! The main villain, a relentless, unstoppable android, was in WW a decade before Cameron's Terminator tore up the box office. Yul Brynner's smirk and silver eyes are unforgettable! His menacing walk is haunting and scary. Dressed all in black, this robo-gunslinger is the personification of one of our deepest fears, that one day the machines we depend on / use, will get smart and no longer find us necessary! Richard Benjamin and James Brolin are the two saps who stumble into the middle of WESTWORLD's meltdown. They think they're in for a nice exotic vacation. In reality, they are scheduled for an ice-cold dose of raw desperation! Will either of them survive? Watch and see! Highly recommended...
B000005HDT|3.0|....but not there yet. I prefer the deep funk of Byrd's \\"Ethiopian Knights\\", but \\"BlackByrd\\" has grown on me considerably. On my first listen I was taken by surprise because I wanted more \\"Little Rasti\\" and I put this away for a long time. I've been listening to it now for a few weeks straight and it's laid back summertime groove has consumed my soul. \\"Street Lady\\" has the same vibe, so I picked it up to, but I will have to stop there and dig on all the great Byrd I have. It seems after Street Lady the music got really really light and fluffy. Snore...zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz. Go get \\"Fancy free\\", \\"Electric Byrd\\", \\"Ethiopian Knights\\", \\"BlackByrd\\" & \\"Street Lady\\" and you will have the funkiest of Donald Byrd and the best in my opinion.
0393035158|5.0|For the ancient and medieval mind, religion provided an explanation of the know world; it was their science. To continue this aspect of a world view, religious dogmas have had to resist all modern (both moral and ethical) concepts in order to protect their god / science.  In this honest and hard-hitting book, Sam Harris takes a solid stand on the false systems that religions are now creating in the modern world.  Instead of answering questions for the educated mind, the issue of faith is on the defensive and is out to \\"demonize\\" any values that religious faith itself did not foster.  Indeed, before modern man started providing scientific facts for the problems of the world, religions fought among themselves for what they claimed was God's eternal truths.  Harris takes on these issues and not only causes, but demands that the reader think!  His chapter on \\"The Problem with Islam\\" is both very reviling and frightening.  He provides five pages of direct quotes (in English) of the hatred the Koran spews out on any none Moslem without compromise.  By placing his book in a post 9/11 age with a world losing control on its stock piles of nuclear and biological weapons, Harris provides the facts that the apocalyptic end will not be bought about by none religious belief, but because the god of the ancient mind failed to accept reality and lasses out in self destruction via the faithful.  This book is a \\"Must Read\\" for the educated mind, which is no long motivated by myths, but values reason.
B0002G2B2M|5.0|This is a sweet simple tale of a boy and a girl so broken and damaged by their individual experiences that they have literally taken steps to seperate themselves from these bad memories and feelings only to find that the scale that balances all the greater rights and wrongs cannot function with just one or the other. <br />Thats what this movie is deep down on the surface it is a clever romantic comedy that illustrates in one take what most others in this genre have failed to do in a whole 96 minutes. <br />Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is a brilliant example of what can be done within the confines of this bloated sub par short attention spanned society of ours without being pretentious or a cookie formula to suit the needs of people looking for a safe escape from the HORRORS of everyday life. <br />Add Jim Carrey in a toned down performance akin to Adam Sandler in PunchDrunk Love and the allways amazing Kate Winslet with tons of familuar cameos and what you got is a whole new genre of film birthed closely from the loins of Fellini and Woody Allen. <br />Love it or hate it Mind is a movie that you have to at least experience once.
B00000K31Q|4.0|Yes. This movie is good, but when I found out it was an extremely butchered version of a shakespeare play, I was kind of apalled that it had none of the acting charisma of shakespeare and it was so loosely based on the play (who went to prom in the 17th century?)that you felt like you were watching just an \\"average teen movie\\". but, all hating aside, this was a good movie that I recommend to anyone who isn't a shakespeare purist. Heath Ledger's charm definitely lent a hand to this movie. I love Julia Stile's bitterness but before she shows it, we all know she has a soft side.
B00003CXDD|5.0|This has everything - an evil sorceress, a lovable scoundrel, and a young man whose self-doubt stands between him and greatness. There are chases, battles, mystic rituals, and a happy homecoming in the end. Maybe that sounds like hundreds of other fantasy movies, including lots of good ones. This one is still different.<br /><br />Through all those battles, the lead character never wields a real weapon. He's no coward, not by a long shot, but he's no fighter. He's small, not very strong, young-looking and not a credible threat to anyone, least of all someone armed, armored, and on horseback. His real strength is his fatherly, even motherly care for the infant at the center of this storm of violence, no matter what happens around him.<br /><br />The credits may list Val Kilmer first, that's just for name recognition. Warwick Davis, in the title role, really made this movie. It's based on a George Lucas story, and I have to wonder where this fits in Lucas' own life. Some of the later movies in the Star Wars series had more child-appeal features in them than the earlier movies did, when Lucas had a child of his own. Maybe Willow's caring character was a sign of Lucas' own paternal urges coming out. Cheap psychology aside, intense fatherliness made Willow into the unique and memorable character that he is.<br /><br />The last few scenes are the most war-like and threatening, perhaps a bit much for sensitive children to watch. That said, I think it's a great movie for kids, if only because it shows a very different way to be a hero.<br /><br />Don't wait until the kids are around to enjoy it, though. Grown-ups in search of pleasant amusement will like it too.<br /><br />//wiredweird
B000274THQ|5.0|The young man, Alex (Daniel Bruhl), is being brutally arrested by the police in DDR days before the fall of the Berlin Wall.  The mother Christiane (Katrin Sass), who is heavily involved in the political party, witnesses the arrest of her son, which leads to her having a severe heart attack and coma.  When Alex is released from prison and finds out that his mother is in a coma and while she is in this coma the Berlin Wall falls.  Germany unites at the same time as Coca Cola, MacDonalds, and other western multinational companies enter the former DDR.  It is a tough time for the people of the former DDR as they are forced into deflation of currency, unemployment, and poverty.  The world as Alex's mother once knew is suddenly gone when she miraculously awakened from her coma.  An unqualified doctor that has remained within the former DDR informs Alex that his mother could die from sudden shock.<br /><br />The mothers condition leads the film into a comical, yet serious roller coaster where good intentions, fear, and love drive Alex's decisions.  The decisions that Alex makes brings to the film a nostalgia of the former DDR's good intentions in politics as well as Alex's own vision of utopia.  The utopia that Alex creates is based on equality, fairness, and goodness without Stasi, the former secret police in DDR that functioned by having one informant per 100 citizens.  Alex even fabricates the idea that Coca Cola is an invention by the DDR in order to protect his mother's health.<br /><br />Good Bye Lenin! is a warm film with the notion of a better world projected in order to save one person.  This idea is noble and it works very well as it brings the audience a sincere idea of utopia.  This utopian vision is based on a large number of lies, which has a symbolic meaning related to human nature.  In the end, Good Bye Lenin! offers a brilliant cinematic event.
B000006OBQ|5.0|Sinatra singing superb in Concert at The Sands with Count Basie And THE Orchestra arranged and conducted by no less than Quincy Jones, it really doesn't get any better than this! Opening with hot sounding Basie band, Frank smoothly launches into a superb \\"Come Fly With Me\\" then on to an engaging and fun \\"I've Got A Crush On You\\" then to a killer version of \\"I've Got You Under My Skin\\" finding Frank at his sophisicated soulful best!

Bravo Frank Sinatra, miss you madly!
B00005LOLD|4.0|This is a nice love story, beautifully shot and acted well.  Good movie, no doubt.  However, I am really appalled by many reviews here that praise the social commentary of the film offhand, and deeply disturbed by the way a few sensibly critical reviews are rated as \\"not useful\\" by many users. <br /> <br />Yes, the movie is obviously meant to be anti-racist, but what it meant back in the 1950s was not much more than white men's right to non-white women.  And regarding Asians, the argument was done by emphasizing the stereotype of submissive and pretty little oriental girls, more desirable than many white women who wanted a little more control over themselves.  Asian males were either erased out of picture, or dehumanized, or played by white men in media, and nobody had any objections.  That was as much as the 50s liberalism could go, and the film reflects it perfectly. <br /> <br />And now it's 2004, and I see so many presumably-white men here still practically saying \\"I'm tolerant and anti-racist because I admire/married/slept with Asian women.\\"  We seem to have made very little progress over half a century.
6305313687|4.0|American History X is one of the most powerful and gripping dramas ever made. The story shows the tragedy of hate and ignorance on both sides of the black/white racial boundary. Narrated posthumously by Daniel Vinyard, the story shows us the hate of white supremicist Derrick Vinyard and how his hate rips not only his world, but his family apart as well. The movie does an excellent job of driving home the old adage that \\"what goes around, comes around.\\" With an amazing cast, and powerful story line, it's all but impossible to walk away from this movie unmoved and with eyes unopened
B0002234LS|4.0|i have to say it was a little disappointing, but i did like it.  just being able to look into Johnny Depps eyes was good enough for me.  i also liked it cause Johnny played the part of an author, and i'm an author (or at least i call myself an author).  it has a very 'different' and 'unexpected' ending.  okay, i figured it out before it was over, but that was only because my aunt told me it would be something you wouldn't expect.   <br /> <br />anyways, if u really like Johnny you should buy it.  also if you want a movie that is a bit unlike any other.   <br /> <br />PEACE! :)
B0001HAISG|5.0|This film should have grossed at least $400 million U.S.  It is absolutely fantastic and works at every level.  Superb casting, storyline, effects, et al.  A million times better than Spielberg's \\"Hook.\\"
B00005JLD4|4.0|Rabbit Proof Fence is an experience that will stay with me for a long time.<br /><br />During the Early 1900's the Australian government formed an organization that could declare parental rights over \\"Caste\\" aboriginal children. Their goal, a three generational breed-out of these lighter skinned children. In short, if they marry caucasions, and their own children do so, their grandchildren would be white. This would obliterate their race, a chilling notion that we have seen many times in history.<br /><br />After scanning reviews for Rabbit Proof Fence, I found that Roger Ebert actually wept at the end of the film. It is definately moving, and the fact that he wept shouldn't necessarily make you conclude its a sad film. Despite the subject matter, the end result is an overwhelming story of strong will, and persistance. Also, its appropriate for the entire family, something hard to find nowadays.
0671027344|4.0|This is a modern Catcher in the Rye. A coming-of-age story about a confused but empathetic young man. The story is told as a series of letters from Charlie, a socially inept and emotionally distraught freshman in high school, to an unnamed person somehow linked to a character in the novel. It doesn't say who that person is, and I never figured it out.<br /><br />Although Charlie has more severe emotional issues than Holden Caulfield, and although his thoughts are more explicit and leave less for the reader to figure out in terms of theme, I thoroughly enjoyed both the story and the character. It took me back to my high school days and I found myself remembering all of my foibles and follies as I read about Charlie's. My only complaint is that the emotion of the kids in the book seemed to be a bit too public. It seems someone is crying in every chapter. I don't remember that being the case in high school. To the contrary, one of the most difficult aspects of high school is dealing with these welling emotions while trying NOT to just burst out in tears because...well, that's just not cool.<br /><br />Walflower won't ever be the classic that Catcher in the Rye is, but it's a great read nonetheless.
B00005MAM2|4.0|This was a blend if simply geinus work and stunning artwork. As well as a good sound track to back it up. If your a fan of anime or just a person willing to see some action storyline as well as magnificent detail this is a movie ( a good one). The plot may me difficult to follow but it is worth it to get some tutoring. See it 'nuff said.
0440180295|5.0|Slaughterhouse Five is a novel that, like many others, I have heard of for years, and always thought I would get to it 'someday'....someday finally arrived. <br /> <br />Described to me by a co-worker as a quasi-science fiction novel, quasi-war novel...I was almost turned off enough to not read it, as those are my two least favorite genres of literature. <br /> <br />But from open to close, Slaughterhouse is compulsively readable.  <br /> <br />Centering on the life of one Billy Pilgrim, the story floats back and forth through episodes of his life as he has become, per his own description, 'unstuck in time'. Weaving between events from his childhood; time spent in the Vietnam war; his marriage; his career; etc.; Billy provides a glimpse into the horrors of war, and the life-long effect they can have on a person. <br /> <br />The strengths of this novel are that the language is easy to follow, the tale is never preachy in its opposition to war, and the humor of following Billy through his time-travels, and the disbelief of others.   <br /> <br />At the end, one is left to question the validity of Billy's travels, as evidence is presented to support what could be deemed simply an 'escape' into past events of his life to deal with the effects of the war....juxtapositioned with present events, that Billy, lost in his past, describes as the 'future'... <br /> <br />Whatever the 'truth' of the story is, Slaughterhouse Five is entertaining, easily read, and highly enjoyable..... <br /> <br />Hopefully others who plan to read it 'someday' will get there eventually. It's worth the wait.  <br /> <br />
B00005R8DB|5.0|The K2 remaster of Brilliant Corners is one of the most dynamic sounding CD's I now own.  I am not that big a fan of Monk's but bought this on the AMG 5 star rating and the fact that it was out on K2.  Most all of the Fantasy Records K2 editions are fabulous sounding.  I own most of them.  This has to be the best.  The music speaks for itself.  I find a lot of Monk's stuff sounds the same.  He did after all re-record most of his original compositions he did for Blue Note, countless times for other labels.  I would give the content a 4 and the sound a 5.  AMG was right.
014028009X|4.0|\\"Bridget Jones's Diary\\" is, of course, the purported diary of a thirty-something Englishwoman obsessed with losing weight, advancing her career, and forming a stable relationship. It is also a loose takeoff of \\"Pride and Prejudice,\\" the basis for a hit movie, and one of the most original books you will read for some time. While \\"chick lit\\" has become a popular genre recently, \\"Bridget\\" stands out because of the stream-of-consciousness look into our heroine's mind. She is often pathetic and always funny. <br /> <br />If you have seen the movie and think there is no need to read the book, think again, because they are quite different. In some ways, the book comes out on top--mainly the tone and style, difficult to recreate on film (although I think the filmmakers got as close as they possibly could). However, I think plotwise the movie triumphs over the book by trimming the subplots. Every time Bridget's mother appeared in the book I felt like yawning. Her story eventually concluded in unbelievable farce, which was mercifully taken out of the film. <br /> <br />Definitely read the book--I'm not sure men would like it but I think most women would. Then see the movie and decide which you like better; they are both worthwhile.
B00005ATQ9|4.0|Truly an amazing epic. The narration is wonderful. The camera as always in Kubricks films is a wonderful vista on the world, though, in this film due to the AMAZING costumes, sets and acting, it surpasses in my estimation any of his other films. I particularly enjoyed the candle lit scenes which I have never seen in any other film (for which he had special lens developed for the low light atmosphere and used an extreme amount of candles for). This is the most underviewed yet of his films. Yet in my estimation is the best. Truly wonderful and thought provoking. The only negative in the film is the length, a common issue in his films, though I enjoy longer films that continue to develop the story. The finally is a must see.
B00008NRLX|4.0|There's no doubt about it, these selections lack the energy of previous albums, but get the hint...the title of the CD is \\"Rainy Day Music\\". This album is full of sad, melancholy music, but very thoughtful. Reminds me of those days that everything was seemingly boring and mundane, but you eventually recognize the beauty and importance of every minute. The blend of their voices is definitely retro 70s, easy, simple acoustic guitar and rhythm. Sit back and remenisce... <br /> <br />
B00028HBKC|5.0|Everybody agrees that this is a great movie. Some guys are questioning the fact that this movie is too bloody. But is quite real. Read the gospels. Our Saviour didn't come here for pleasure, or for chatting with Herod, drink some wine, have wonderful feasts and marry a beautiful girl (some fools say he married Mary Magdalane)and be eternally happy  as Hollywood wants us to believe. No. He came here to redeem us. He came here to show us how a Christian should face suffering And above this, he came here to show us the real face of the Father, Our Father that is LOVE. Seeing this movie is seeing how much Jesus loves us.Meditating The Passion of the Christ is the DEVOTION of Devotions. A lot of conversions have occurred after people meditating these sufferings of Our Lord. ALL the Saints have meditated and had a profound devotion for them. Even more, they recommended this devotion in order to obtain real sanctity of life, because the REAL LOVE (only somebody that is willing to suffer like this and die for you , really loves you!) attracts LOVERS. <br /> <br />Regarding the accusations of \\"antisemitism\\", I just have one recommendation. GET REAL. JEWS have always hated Jesus and his Church. They killed him and they persecuted and killed Jesus' followers. Deep inside they feel Guilty of these crimes and they think that denying the facts, buying some people's conciense is going to make them feel better. But that's not the case. I recommend them to ask forgiveness. First, to God and then to the whole world for al their crimes, lies and corruption they have sown in the world. Then they are going to feel free at last...Nobody is going to do anything or throw a sotone at them. We all are sinners! They also should try considering returning Palestine (they stole it to the palestinians with the help of UN that was and still is under their control) to their legal owners and leave in peace. The world is going to applaude such a decision.
1591840562|5.0|I predict \\"The Art of The Start\\" will become the staple for every startup. Its an important book to read for anyone in a leadership role. I think this book was also very important to Guy as it closed the loop in a series of books that started with my personal favorite, \\"The Macintosh Way\\". It's very endearing that Guy's time at Apple meant so much to him and became the measuring stick for every venture that followed. However, this book isn't focused on technology, its more of a road map on how to start just about anything you can think of. Steering us from business clichs and pitfalls, the evangelist delivers a mantra to guide the eager and inspire the intimidated.
1577311523|4.0|Eckhart Tolle in this book comes across as really knowing his stuff. This is a hard topic to write on and an even harder thing to pick up use in our lives. Eventhough sometimes its a little nebulous,anyone who is interested in sprititual growth should read this at some point. <br />thanks for reading my review and I wish you luck
B00028HBKM|5.0|Yeah this review is long overdue, and by rating you can tell where I stand. Furthermore (in defense of those who appreciated the movie) when you attack the movie about it's accuracy, don't use another movie as a reference. How about you look the story up in the bible (Matthew, Mark, Luke, John) and then come back with discrepencies. Then maybe there can be a civilized reply. <br />  <br />     On the other hand, I think the movie itself was a great display of what happened. I'm not saying every detail is exactly as it was, (The invention of the chair???? i dunno about that) but I wouldn't be surprised if much was different of how it really took place. Great production and music, which is played perfectly in the movie (right time, proper lenght). The only thing is that the movie wasn't in English. It made us look down and read the words and take our eyes of the film itself.
B0002IVN9W|5.0|After reading pitchfork's ecstatic review and also noticing insound.com hailed \\"Funeral\\" as \\"album of the year, I was hesitant to pick this one up. I am always suspicious of such hype, but it only took one listen to justify all the hype surrounding this record.  <br />     Most often, a great album will snag my attention with a beautiful hook or a catchy riff, yet with \\"Funeral\\", I established a very quick emotional bond with the music, especially with Win Butler's powerful vocals. <br />     I had a lot of trouble trying to pin down the emotive powers of the music. \\"Funeral\\" travels a fine line between beauty and over-the-top musicianship, but the humanistic touches flourish through the sublties, making the album totally genuine and earnest.  <br />     Yet despite the album's heavy emotional content, it's a surprisingly fun (and danceable) listen, with catchy guitar stabs, fluid bass lines, and upbeat drum licks. The finale on \\"Crown of Love\\" is absolutely loveable, while the open guitar riff of \\"Wake Up\\" just plain rocks. The album's pinnacle, \\"Neighborhood #3 (Power Out) is slightly reminiscent of Modest Mouse, with it's emotional ambiguity and lyrical integrity.  <br />The Arcade Fire have recieved a lot of comparisons to Neutral Milk Hotel, and while I fail to see any strong connection, both groups seem to brilliantly and effortlessly defy every sort of conventional categorization. At times \\"Funeral\\" seems like classical, indie pop, rock, dance, and slow alternative, sometimes simultaneously. And they still blend this eclectic mix masterfully, which merely shows the musical and emotional depth they've brought to the record.  <br />      However, trying to categorize and label this record seems unfair to its intent. The songs, with subjects like suburbia, parents, death, and car rides can seem at once sorrowful and still hopeful. The Arcade Fire have crafted a modern masterpiece that will continue to amaze because each listen can offer new insight, continuing to challenge the listener.  <br />      Don't buy this record because of the hype or because of this review. Go to The Arcade Fire's website and listen to the samples and merely let yourself get enveloped in this aural masterpiece. I can almost guarantee you will strike a deep, internal cord with something you won't be able to describe. It's something I still can't quite figure out, but most of me really doesn't want to know. All I know is that i simply can't stop listening.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|Well, it's certainly not loathing over this cast recording! I absolutely love this album! Stephen Schwartz's music is beautiful and uplifting, the performances are outstanding and the spirit of the show is definitely conveyed through this cast recording. All the songs are catchy enough to get stuck in your head, but my personal favorites are \\"What Is This Feeling\\", \\"For Good\\", \\"Dancing Through Life\\", \\"One Short Day\\" and of course \\"Popular\\". I may not know a whole lot about overly sensitive and pedestrian lyrics or synthetic sounding music, but I know what I like and I think that \\"Wicked\\" is a great recording for the whole family to enjoy. <br /> <br />~~~Amy~~~ <br />
B000001IPL|5.0|I had heard of offspring back in the day but never listened to one of their cd's. Then the other day I purchased their cd from amzon and since then I have listened to it at least 4 hours a day! I love this album and wouldn't take it out of my cd player even if the world was coming to an end. If you like good music this is the cd to buy. I can't believe I almost missed out. Don't make the same mistake as me buy it this instant! Offspring is the greatest band to ever walk this earth and this is their greatest cd!
B000002J1U|5.0|Jerry Mcully has no idea what the hell he's talking about.  You can praise a band but condemn their origin.  Zepplin I and II were original and revoloutionary, as for three, dont listen to it unless you want your mind to get blown out of your freaking skull.  This album will blow you away. <br /> <br />P.S. Jerry Mcully get a real job
B00005JKDR|5.0|Seldom do we find a movie as delightful and as insightful as Monsters Inc.  On the delightful side, it is one good story, it dazzlingly  us with amazing animation and a level of character development seldom seen in real movies.  On the insightful side, it deals with the terror that all of us face, the terror of the unknown.   <br /> <br />It would be a serious mistake to call this a childrens movie.  Although my grandchildren have probably watched it a dozen times, it is a movie that us adults will truly enjoy.  Monsters Inc.  address adult issues, namely, our fear of the unknown.  The monsters are just as fearful of the children as the children are of them. It is only through fear and intimidation of the children can the monsters do their job  . .  .supply scream-power for the power plants that supply energy to their monster world.   <br /> <br />Although each world lives in fear of the other, they have more in common that the differences that seem so readily apparent.  Each world desires to live in peace, each world wants love and acceptance, but it is only through the use of terror can the monster world survive, or so they think.   <br /> <br />This is a movie about overcoming the prejudices that keep us apart as human beings.  But thankfully, it did not degenerate to a kum-by-ya feel good movie with simplistic politically correct answers for what ails the human race; rather, it shows us that acceptance of our differences takes work and that no matter how good our intentions and motives are, there will always be some who succumb to hatred and prejudice.  It is a complex world we live in.   <br /> <br />This is a must have movie for every family <br />
B0002DB0FO|5.0|Everwood is the best TV show on now and what a better way to get ready for its third season than to go back and watch the first season on DVD.  Watching the first few episodes of the first season was a great way to review how all of the storylines started.  Putting 23 episodes on 6 discs instead of 4 makes the picture quality outstanding and the sound is great too.  Even some of the commentary (4 episodes) is interesting because it is done by a different collection of cast and crew for each of the 4 episodes.  The extras which include a gag reel and a feature on the making of the show are better than the extras on most DVD sets today.  Overall it is one of the best DVD sets that I have purchased.
B00005JLXE|4.0|To the reviewer who claims that there are 172 used and new copies of this movie for sale and that they have \\"never seen a film that so many wanted to be rid of\\" I'd like to say: Have ya ever heard of a film called Spiderman? There are 191 used and new copies of that one for sale. 191! That's more than 172! How about a movie called The Matrix? Ever heard of that? There are 212 new and used copies of that one for sale. 212! You get the point. I guess these numbers indicate to some that these movies suck but I don't agree with that. I like what I like. I liked all three of these films and especially Daredevil. It's an introduction to the character and his world that makes for a good movie and has me wanting more. I don't think that's a bad thing. It doesn't give all the best stuff away and paves the way for more to come. Elektra is on the way. I'd love to see Daredevil 2. The unrated directors cut of Daredevil is coming also and should contain more good stuff (this sure looked like a longer R rated film that was cut for time and to get a PG-13) so I can't wait!
B0002BO0AS|5.0|I saw these guys opening up on the first (and only good) headbangers ball tour with shadows fall, killswitch engage, and lamb of god.  That night I bought \\"the strings of consience\\" and liked it alot...but it got old fast.  Unearth has decided to abandon the nu-metalish whining vocals (thank god) and really develop their style.  result: the oncoming storm.  This album is pure metalcore/melodic death bliss.  These guys have way more talent than was apparent on 'the strings....' They even have a track thats explores diffrent time signatures.  This album is well worth the petty price of 10$ (still to expensive but most cd's go up around 16-17) Unearth are definetly the best american metal act of today! \m/
B00004RFCM|5.0|Carrie is in a restauraunt having her first \\"drink thing\\" with Big. He brings a male friend and they ogle other women in the restaraunt together. In the most classy scene of all 6 seasons, Carrie stands up, smiles big, pays for their drinks, tells him to have a great time, and walks out, unresponsive to his pleas for her to stay. This is the scene that made me watch every episode of this show at least twice. Totally brilliant! Season one, while not as beautiful visually as the others, is still the very best.
B0000542D2|5.0|I'm a 21 year old college kid, but I've always loved the Beatles! They're my favorite! I was so excited when I watched this movie; the Beatles' first movie. It was so funny and I've been watching it over and over again! It's a nifty DVD for all Beatles fans!

B00008OLYN|5.0|Damnation was actually the first Opeth cd that I purchased. I was totally unkowning of what I was getting into. I knew that Opeth was a heavy metal band, but when I received this album in the mail, I was a bit surprised. It was a hard thing to accept at first, but through many times of listening and reading the lyrics, I realized that this album is truly great. The lyrics are erie and easy to relate to. After living with Damnation for a while, I decided that I needed more opeth and bought Deliverance, Blackwater Park and eventually Orchid and Morning Rise. I haven't been able to find Still Life or My Arms Your Hearse, but I will and they will be mine. Opeth is a great band and Damnation is just another piece of brilliance that accents the singing ability of Mikael Akerfeldt as well as the abilities of the band. I wouldn't however, suggest buying this album first, try Dileverance or Blackwater Park. Favorite songs: Windopane (the best in my opinion on the cd) and weakness (which is very eerie). Oh yeah the album art on every album is awesome.
B0001ZMWQO|5.0|This is one of the best debut albums ever.  If you look at other band's debuts they are definetly not this polished ,(i.e. Radiohead's \\"Pablo Honey\\") So i will rate each individual song. <br /> <br />1. Jaqueline- 5/5 Its ALWAYS better on holiday <br />2. Tell Her Tonight- 4/5 Download the german version if you can <br />3. Take Me Out- 5/5 The first US single and a great song  <br />4. Dark of the Matinee- 6/5 The best song on the album, and video is great too <br />5. Auf Acshe- 3/5 My least favorite but still good <br />6. Cheating on You- 4/5 Cool song <br />7. This Fire- 5/5 Another great song <br />8. Darts of Pleasure- 5/5 Cool song with funny german lyrics \\"I am called Superfantastick\\"  <br />9. Michael- 4/5 Weirdest song on the album, but has a great guitar line <br />10. Come On Home- 5/5 I like the slow down part when they say \\"Come on Home\\" <br />11. 40'- 5/5 Originally i didnt like the lalalalalas but after a while it grew on me <br /> <br />Download Words So Leisured (the dark version of Darts of Pleasure) <br />and All For You;Sophia <br />
B000002UAO|5.0|Drive My Car (*****): An excellent opener with an excellent intro. This is the most rocker song on the album with very ironic lyrics, great hard rock vocals and full of beep-beeps. Paul plays that fine lead guitar solo. <br /> <br />Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown) (*****): A classic written by John and maybe the highest point of the album. As everybody knows, this is the first rock record to feature a sitar, played by George. The lyrics can have a lot of meanings and it actually have a special meaning to me. <br /> <br />You Won't See Me (****): This Paul's song has a nice melody and really good backing vocals. It reminds me to \\"I'll Feel A Whole Lot Better\\" (a song the Byrds recorded in 1965 too), because of the anti-love theme. <br /> <br />Nowhere Man (*****): Another John's classic. This one has some of the best (three-part) harmonies the Beatles ever recorded with very introspective lyrics and a lead guitar solo played very early in the song. It was a gold single in US (peaked at #3 in Billboard), released in early 1966. <br /> <br />Think For Yourself (****): One of the first \\"very good\\" George's songs. The fuzz bass, played by Paul, is amazing. <br /> <br />The Word (****): I really love this one. It's a song about Universal Love written two years before the \\"Flower Power\\" movement. Very colorful lyrics. <br /> <br />Michelle (*****): Paul usually wrote an inmortal ballad on the Beatles albums, and this is his inmortal ballad on Rubber Soul. An instant classic. It seems that Paul plays all the instruments (including some sweet bass and guitar playing), except drums. \\"Michelle\\" won the Grammy for the best song of 1966. <br /> <br />What Goes On (***): This country-rock tune was written in 1963, but finally recorded for this album. Sung by Ringo, it was like the Beatles wanted to make another \\"Act Naturally\\", though this is far better, of course. <br /> <br />Girl (*****): A wonderful John's acoustic song, it's about both a dreamed and bitchy girl. The guitar work has a great Greek sound. <br /> <br />I'm Looking Through You (****): Like \\"You Won't See Me\\", this is another anti-love song written by Paul. It's a very enjoyable tune. <br /> <br />In My Life (*****): Again, a masterpiece written by John, and maybe his best love song. Producer George Martin plays a delicious double-speed piano. This song was voted as \\"the best song ever\\" by many artists. <br /> <br />Wait (***): Though this song is 100% a filler (it was recorded during the \\"Help!\\" sessions and included here because they needed one more song), I think it's a quite good one, especially because of George's tone pedal guitar. <br /> <br />If I Needed Someone (****): One of the best George's songs ever, it has a Byrdish sound. In fact, George said that \\"If I Needed Someone\\" is the riff from \\"The Bells Of Rhymney\\" and the drumming from \\"She Don't Care About Time\\". The harmonies are superb. <br /> <br />Run For Your Life (***): This was the first song recorded during the Rubber Soul sessions, but it was included as the last song because John hated it. But I think that his great vocals and George's lovely lead guitar save the song. <br />
0671027344|5.0|I have re-read this book,many times now.I am absolutly in love with it.I love the personality the author has given the main character.He has simple,but at the same time,very complex thoughts.If that makes sense at all.He comes across alot of problems that are in great amounts in our society today.This book is an example on what alot of people go through daily.It keeps you wanting to read on.I can never put it down once I have picked it up.It keeps you guessing,wondering...what exactly he will think next,what will happen next.In some parts it will kind of through you off a little bit,like, something you never really thought would happen,happens. But it pulls together nicely and just really,is a great book I have come to believe.
0679428895|3.0|Despite what you might think, Mount Vesuvius is something of a secondary character in this historical novel, even though the reader is well aware of what's in store for the mountain and the Roman towns of Pompeii and Herculaneum.  But knowledge of the impending cataclysm only increases the reader's interest with each successive tremor or sulfurous odor.<br /><br />Robert Harris could have opted for a multi-character \\"movie of the week\\" kind of scenario, but instead he focuses more tightly on Attilius, the newly appointed Aquarius (think chief engineer) of the Aqua Augusta, the freshwater lifeline of southern Italy.  It's a good choice, in fact I found the historical details of the Roman aqueducts more fascinating than the volcano; but then I opted for physics rather than geology in high school.  In any case, a disruption to the flow of water to the people around the Bay of Neapolis (Naples) sends Attilius on an expedition to repair the aqueduct and restore the flow of water.<br /><br />If ash and lava pose the more imminent threat, it's water that offers the catalyst and ultimate redemption.  What should be a routine \\"fix and repair\\" operation uncovers further mysteries involving the disappearance of Attilius' predecessor, political corruption and romantic intrigue.  And the presence of Pliny the Elder as a major character offers a number of opportunities for scientific or historical digression, none of which derail the story, thankfully enough.<br /><br />The actual eruption of Vesuvious and its subsequent destruction of Pompeii and Herculaneum only constitute the final hundred pages of the book, but the Harris does an excellent job of describing the event as if you were there to witness it.  It's a good book, although not worthy of some of the hype that it's received.
B00005QCVY|5.0|I watch this movie every year at Christmas and I think it is fabulous.  The movie is based largely on Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol, except in this case instead of a scrooge we have George Bailey.  George is a hardworking, decent, and kind man who runs a small bank in town.  Unfortunately for him, the bad guy in the movie, Mr. Potter also runs a bank and wants a monopoly in the town.  When one of George's employees loses a large sum of money Potter jumps in and tries to ruin George.  Distraught over his predicament, George jumps off a bridge.  But - an angel comes along and saves him, for the moment.  Clarence, the likable angel that looks more like an older, drunk but beloved uncle than an angel, shows George what life in the town would be like had he not lived.  Through this he shows George how important his kind deeds have been over the years to his friends and family.  Without George the town is unfriendly, run down, and less livable.   <br /> <br />This is an excellent film and one of Jimmy Stewart's best roles.  I highly recommend it. <br />
B00001OH7X|3.0|The 1970s saw David Bowie in one of the most extraordinary peaks of creativity ever achieved by any Rock'n'Roll artist.  Whole albums, such as Ziggy Stardust and Station to Station are perfect from the first moment to the last.  Other masterpieces, though flawed, contain such an overload of brilliance that it overshadows whatever weak track exist on the albums ('Hunky Dory' is a perfect example for that). <br /> <br />Lodger, in a sense, is different in the sense that it foreshadows most of Bowie's later albums: it's a mixed bag.  At times experimental ('Red Money'), Anthemic ('DJ'), silly ('Yassassin'), and sometimes just utterly brilliant ('Boys Keep Swinging' and 'Look Back in Anger') - Lodger is as good a candidate for a 'typical' Bowie album as it gets. <br /> <br />The weaker tracks, such as 'Yassassin' and 'African Night Flight' are not so much bad as miscalculated - Bowie's rock music talents gone wrong.  Some tracks, such as opener 'Fantastic Voyage' and 'Move On' are solid rock tracks, not spectacular but with interesting lyrics ('I'll never say anything nice again' Bowie mysteriously declares on 'Voyage'). <br /> <br />The two highlights are the majestic, dark and hard rockin' \\"Look Back in Anger\\", which has been a frequent show opener for Bowie.  With rifts that anticipate the leaner, meaner sound of \\"Scary Monsters\\", \\"Look Back in Anger\\", as opaque as it may appear (the video suggests an allusion to a deformed artist, and maybe to Oscar Wilde's 'The Picture of Durian Grey'), it's a deserved classic. <br /> <br />Rarely played live, \\"Boys Keep Swinging\\" an ironic tribute to youth and masculinity.  It seems like a stylistic throw back to the 1950s or even 30s, but the music is patently Bowie, with a hard beat beneath the pretty melody.  It's yet another classic. <br /> <br />For most artists, Lodger would have been a career highlight.  Only in comparison to Bowie's remarkable career can an album as strong as this one seem so mundane. <br />
B00023BLXK|5.0|I rented this movie for two reasons, to see Diego Luna in something other than Open Range with Kevin Costner, and mostly because I love ballroom dancing, especially anything latin. I wasn't disappointed. I bought the movie right away afterwards and have watched it over and over. The music was great and Diego was absolutely delightful, what a sexy little bugger, who wouldn't want someone like that dancing you across the floor and anywhere else he wanted to take you. In the special features he talks about how excited he got when he finally learned the dance steps and you can see that joy all over his face in the one special scene.  For the most part the whole movie is great.  The ending is a little weak and that was the only disappointment. I highly recommend this one if you want to get sweeped away in music and dance.
B00005JLT5|5.0|THE PIANIST is a devastatingly simple, yet moving, singular viewpoint of the dreadful Holocaust.  Adrian Brody plays the title role, a quiet, brilliant pianist who watches his family being hauled off to a concentration camp.  Scene by scene, over years of pain and anguish, Brody sees others killed brutally and manages to survive by doing what he's told and hiding out in various buildings in the destroyed city of Warsaw.  Director Roman Polanski's Oscar winning guidance gives us Brody's view of this event, and supports him with actors of fine quality:  Frank Finlay as his father, and most notably Thomas Kretschman as the German soldier who in the last segment of the movie joins Brody in the most moving and evocative scenes in the film.  Krestschmann is an actor to watch---he is brilliant in this small but unforgettable role.<br /><br />The music is awesome, and the movie's dramatic thrust is heightened by its inclusion.<br /><br />Not an easy movie to watch, but deeply moving and memorable.  Brody's Oscar is surely deserved.
B00008PW3Q|4.0|Most cynics are saying this is nothing but  a cash-in. I wholeheartedly disagree. There are some GREAT songs on this album. But there are also some mediocre songs, songs that could have used some more fine-tuning, or songs that just aren't that memorable. Some have that \\"trademark\\" Fleetwood Mac sound, some don't. The opener,  \\"What's the World Coming To\\" is as good as anything on Rumours or Tusk, and the lyrics make a great opening statement of purpose. My favourite song on this disc is Lindsey Buckingham's \\"Come\\" which sounds NOTHING like they've ever recorded, my second favourite is Stevie Nicks' \\"Thrown Down\\", which has \\"that sound\\" - you know it's her, but you don't mind, cause you love Stevie so much. My only complaint has to do with the fact that so much music can be put on a compact disc now  <br />( 80 minutes - which in the seventies would have been a double album ) that there are just TOO MANY songs on it, and it's hard to digest in one sitting. If this were edited down to the best 10 songs, it would be a CLASSIC album. As it is, it rather reminds me of Tusk, with the clash of styles and the overall length. Technically, sonically , this cd sounds GREAT, the instruments come out of the speakers like they are right in front of you. It sounds better than any other FM release. A very solid return to form for the Mac. I can only hope they stay together after the tour to record some more songs together, as I think their future has never looked better.
B00004Z4WR|3.0|GONE IN 60 SECONDS is just that...60 seconds after it's over, you'll forget it probably.  The last car chase/rescue scene, however, is pure dynamite, with some exciting car driving and tension when Cage goes after Eccleston.  However, getting there isn't quite as exciting.  Director Dominic Sana (Swordfish) keeps things rather lethargic early on, and wastes the talents of Angelina Jolie and Robert Duvall in thankless roles.  Nicolas Cage gives his sincere, stoney eyed macho performance, and actors like Scott Caan, Delroy Lindo, Timothy Olyphant and Giovanni Ribisi do well, but this film doesn't rely so much on character development as the cars.  Nice vintage cars, too!  A purely adrenaline/testosterone film, and not one of the best, but the ending is worth the wait!
B000024D4R|5.0|This album was Pink Floyd entering their peak as musicians. With just five songs, Roger Waters was able to make a recording that was as close to perfection as one could get. Moreover, with \\"Pigs (Three Different Ones)\\", Waters gave us a hint as to the brilliance that awaited us with \\"The Wall.\\" To me, this will always be the quiet masterpiece that so many other \\"fans\\" overlooked.
0385512104|5.0|.....DON'T WALK, to get a copy of this incredible book! An amazing, superbly crafted tale, \\"The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Nighttime\\" opens the mind of an autistic child, Christopher, to the reader. His bewildered and beleagured parents, who try so hard to do what's right for their son, are wonderful characters who mimic their real life counterparts with sympathy and finesse. <br /> <br />You WILL be sorry if you miss this one!
B000002UAU|5.0|This is a timeless masterpiece of an album.  Those who fail to recognize its brilliance are the same people who wouldn't know how to feel the power of Beethoven's 9th symphony or see the beauty in a Monet painting or ever be able to understand the majesty of an Ansel Adams photograph.  I feel sorry for them.
B00005JMUA|5.0|Kill Bill Vol. 2 can be summed up in the simple phrase \\"Five Point Palm Exploding Heart Technique.\\" Both the name and the idea of this martial arts \\"technique\\" are utterly unbelieveable and that's why its so fun!<br /><br />If you can accept the pure fun and remarkable artistic vision that \\"Q & U\\" put into the Kill Bill series, this is one of the coolest cinematic experiences you'll ever have. Highly Recommended!
B00008ADPF|1.0|Ugh.  <br />Thats the first reaction I get every time I hear these talentless posers on the radio. The singers voice just irritates me beyond explaination and the band can't play. Did you know these guys are signed to Roadrunner records? The same label that has kick ass bands like Slipknot, Murderdolls, and Stone Sour? Sorry, but these fairies just don't fit in with those guys. I just wish all their loser fans would wake up and realize how much Nickleback suuuuuucks.  <br /> <br />DustinX over and out! <br />
B00005JNEI|2.0|A documentary should be an unbiased FULL look at the truth.  The American Public needs to realize that Michael Moore is simply a voice with a slightly biased look on our American President. Why do I get the feeling that everyone who is writing these reviews are voicing their own hatred for Mr. Bush. Bush could have definitely done somethings different but instead of further pushing the gap between America, voice your opinion by voting.
B0000019PA|5.0|This indie opera (a terrible label, I know) is simply transcendent.  It is a must for every single music lover. <br /> <br />Jeff Mangum, the singer and more or less the brains of the operation, writes amazing songs.  They are carefully meshed together in a single album; once you start playing track one, you are obliged to hear the entire LP to the end. <br /> <br />Their instrumentation is also layered and complex.  The use of horns and the saw works to create a pervasive mournful mood.  Comparisons have been made between this album and \\"Pet Sounds\\" and it definitely merits such a lofty association. <br /> <br />
6304493681|1.0|I read many reviews for this interesting film and I find it curious that many reviewers (Not all mind you...even I have done it) are \\"Bashing\\" the film but fail to give any reasons for their dislike. Reviewers say that the story is confusing or hard to follow and yet they can offer no specifics. I would offer you something to ponder. Is a film good only because you can understand it? It took me 3 viewings and a double reading of the Manga (Comic Book) before I began to understand the Genius of this concept. It does a wonderful job of using the \\"Ghost in the Machine\\" complex well. I just wish that people would give reasons before they give films bad ratings. Have a Good Day
B0001XAPX8|5.0|... strange and haunting picture .... actually I would kind of consider it three seperate little movies ... The first part Anthony H as the big town college professor moved into a small town ... the second part Anthony H meets trailer trashy Nicole Kidman and falls in love agian ... and finally the third adventure part is the introduction of Ed Harris as Nicole's love crazed violent husband ....  <br /> <br /> <br />The movie kind of clunks along as the viewer watches the characters develop and the writer slaps us in the face with the big 'surprise' that Anthony Hopkins is actually born a Southern black ... HMMMM .. that was a stretch .... but then again the acting of this movie is so great I can overlook all the politically correct warts .....  <br /> <br /> <br />So like celery ... if you enjoy charater studies then this is the movie for you .... so much so that friends who were watching the movie with me didn't even believe it was Nicole Kidman on the screen .... Fabulous or what
B0002MPU1K|2.0|With all of the hype about this guy I expected a much better CD.  He is somewhere between a Harry Connick Jr. 'wanna-be' and a Barry Manilow 'wanna-be' without the voice of either. I give it 2 stars for the nice sounding string arrangements.  All in all, play it softly at a dinner party and it won't bother anyone.
0048200158|4.0|First, this edition is out of print, but if you can find it, that would be good. This book contains one essay and three stories. You can find these writings in other books or collections, but it's still handy to have them in one edition. I got my copy by using an out-of-print specialist. <br /> <br />Also, this has no bearing or relation to the Hobbit or Lord of the Rings, for which some readers may be disappointed. The author has many other works besides the Lord of the Rings. Like most well-known artists, they're remembered for their masterpeices, while the lesser-known works are neglected. <br /> <br />The essay is a discussion of \\"fairy tales\\", and gives insight into Tolkien's concept of a \\"fairy tale\\", which are not the sugary-sweet, rot-your-mind tales we often imagine when we hear the phrase \\"fairy tale\\".  <br /> <br />The two following stories elaborate on that concept: <br /> <br />\\"Tree and Leaf\\" is a character study in a \\"little\\" man who is suprised how his insigificant work turns into something more than he could have imagined. <br /> <br />\\"Smith of Wootton Major\\" is a story of a man who was privilaged to visit the \\"perilous realms\\". <br /> <br />The last story, \\"The Homecoming of Beorhtnoth\\" also reveals the authors general focus of interest - Anglo-Saxon languages, poetry, etc.
B0002EXH5O|3.0|I can't believe it, why would you mess with a flawless classic, ok first of let me say that the re-mastering is terrific, I like the power,  but the re-mix and the new vocals sound WEAK, on most of it you can't even tell really, but there are so many little things that just ruin it,  for example on \\"Take no Prisoners\\", that quick little bass line (anyone whos heard it knows what part I'm talking about) you cant even hear it, and the backing vocals sound weak,  like a demo or something, I liked the shouting backup vocals, at least the end of the song has them.  and on \\"Lucretia\\", when it says \\"Dave your mental anyway HEY\\" the \\"HEY\\" has absolutly no power.   <br />But the kicker is definetly \\"Five Magics\\", one of my favorite Megadeth songs, and the vocals are completly.....well 90% jacked up, I could live with it until the backing vocals on the \\"Possesed with hellish torment\\" part,  now the backing vocals were kind of cheesy in the original BUT still sounded really cool,  on THIS ONE they sound like someone doing a Bary White impersonation,  and they are sung with no feeling whatsoever,  like he's just reading it off of a peice of paper. <br />the original vocals made that song unique and great.  <br />All and All the vocal changes were very UNNECCESARY, and weakend the album. <br /> <br />OK I will say this, you should buy this just because its Megadeth and its a great album, but if you've never heard it before BUY THE ORIGINAL,  Rust in Peace has been one of my favorite albums for like 12 years now, and its hard to hear it different. if you can't find the original then buy this, if you've never heard it before you won't be dissapointed its still great just not as great.  and the extra tracks are nice.
0465011020|4.0|This book may be neither great literature or deep political science analysis, but it offers a grueseome insider's view of what goes on inside North Korea's gulag camps. The author's story is terrible indeed, but he manages to write from a humanistic point of view and also comes up with highly revealing details about \\"normal\\" political life in North Korea - observations about the hypocrisy, corruption, and occasional humanitarian instincts of officials ignorings their orders etc.
B0000C9JFO|5.0|Cedric Klapisch makes his directorial case for the new Europe of cooperation and happiness.  The crushing bureaucracy of the Euro will not be the future.  Rather, the future is a bunch of twenty-something's experiencing life in a laid back, bohemian tradition reminiscent of the 60's hippies with the added ingredient of techno dance.  The final scene where young Frenchy Xavier finally gets the job he's coveted, this scene then progresses to \\"The Graduate\\" statement, namely, run from your parent's reality to a new world.    Xavier has a girlfriend, a stockbroker father, and an ex-hippy mother.  His world is very boring. In France a huge part of the population works for the government. To get a ministry job, he must learn Spanish, so he leaves home for the first time and arrives in swinging Barcelona.  (See my review of \\"Barcelona\\") A newlywed couple, a young surgeon and his shy, but beautiful wife befriend him.  He lives with them briefly, but then takes up residence with students from all over Europe in a small apartment where they are practically crawling over each other when they are not drunk or high.  This is a metaphor for the youth of Europe working together in study and fun.  There's some stereotyping here, but it's very mild.  To the director's credit, the cultural traits are handled by viable vignettes.  There's the lesbian girl story, the handsome Dutchman discovers he's a father, the English girl is not as anal as her roommates thought when a young American beds her. The proud Spanish girl, the funny Italian, and the straight-laced German know how to party.    But Xavier is thrown together with Anna-Sophia, the doctor's wife.  From his friend the Belgian lesbian, he learns the secret of making love to a woman.  Naturally Anna is so taken by Xavier's attentions, she falls for him passionately and they have an affair under her husband's nose.  Meanwhile, Xavier's whining French gal breaks with him.      These are classic tribulations of youth.  How wonderfulto find a place where one can go native at least once in a lifetime, whether Barcelona, Key West, or Tango Tango.  Can it be a permanent state of mind, the whirlwind of youth and sexuality?  I hope so.
B00005JNEI|1.0|It is sad that too many people accept this propaganda as fact, when it is just the make believe world of an ego-maniacal man, who does not have the courage to run for office himself.  Why should he?  Much easier to sit back and critize those who serve our country while raking in millions pretending to be a \\"man of the people.\\"
B00003CXA4|5.0|Notwithstanding his having been a great man, Gandhi is not necessarily an example for our times. This is a beautifully made film; one of the most moving ever made, but not for its perceived \\"Lessons\\".  Rather, this film is great for what makes any film great: wonderful acting (phenomenal on Mr. Kingsley's part), skilled direction, great camera cinematography, lighting, editing, and pace.  The sceenplay and story, of course, are highly contributory herein, but even were this fiction the film would still qualify as a great film.  It is simply a great film however you look at it. You needn't read too much into this film to enjoy it; or see in Gandhi's example, say, a panacea of sorts for our world of today.  Passive non-violent resistance worked for Gandhi first in South Africa (to some extent) and then India mostly because his adversary was a civilized one.  Gandhi, let's remember, basically used British law against the British themselves.  He was able to succeed not simply because his cause was noble and/or because passive resistance is inherently effective.  I grant you that his campaign was a brilliant one, skillfully engineered; but against most any other country save Britain, it would have only \\"ended before it began,\\" as former Soviet dissident Natan Sharansky says in his book \\"The Case for Democracy\\"; most likely in Gandhi's death or  disappearance. [...] I have read Gandhi's autobiography and I give him his just due. I'm just saying that Imperial Britain's historic traditions and norms of behavior had an important role herein as well, and this ought be recognized (and no, I'm not British myself). Gandhi is an example in one way (and maybe we'll see the likes of another Gandhi somewhere, someday), but \\"His Example\\" isn't one we should deceive ourselves as being applicable across the board within the chaotic world in which we live.  In short, this film is a superb treatment of an important historical episode (particular to a rather specific period and set of circumstances) and, as such, well worth your time viewing. Cheers!cumstances) and, as such, well worth your time viewing. Cheers!
B0001ME5L2|5.0|This album was great I must say.  I felt it had so much more depth than Let Go and I'm really happy about the fact that it's not as produced (I know this for a fact because I stood in the second row at one of her free mall concerts and she sounds the same live as she does on the album).   <br /> <br />The thing about Avril Lavigne is that a lot of people dislike her because she only appeals to a certain type of crowd (11-20 year olds that just can't seem to find good relationships, have been sheltered in a pop-invested box for most of their life, and feel that this is their oppurtunity to break out of conformity).  However, many people don't realize that she may not have guitar skills even comparable to Van Halen or Hendrix, but she still can sing what she feels and write lyrics that bring insight into a world of misguided teen pop.  Another thing that many of the true punks and metalheads that grew up listening to their parent's old Led Zeppelin and Sex Pistols records and are now being weaned on things like Slayer and The Misfits don't realize is that there are people out there that have not had the oppurtunity to grow up quite as rapidly and still need guidance into their journey into adulthood.  Personally, I feel Avril Lavigne, in this case, is quite the eye of the storm. <br /> <br />Anyway, back to the review... <br /> <br />This album is great because each song on this album expresses a new and unique idea (contrary to the contant boy-bashing themes on Lavigne's \\"Let Go\\").  I think that anyone could find something to relate to on this album as it has songs not only about how relationships don't work but also about love, friendship, loneliness, grief, insecurity, individuality, happiness, and , with the addition of \\"I Always Get What I Want\\", the things that go through the mind of a bratty, self-centered adolescent.   <br /> <br />The reason I would recommend this album stongly is not only that I am a fan of Avril's work, but I think this album to be nothingless than lyrically genius.  I would also hope that anyone would buy this album instead of the USA and Candian version because \\"Nobody's Home\\" really illustrates her unique live talent and \\"I Always Get What I Want\\" is a great fun track that makes the album that much better.
B000069AUI|3.0|I like this band well enough, but I really love a song that I keep hearing, but cannot figure out the name of!

B00009W0U4|3.0|I watched this movie and can only give it 3 stars for Monica Belluci's haunting performance. Otherwise, the movie made me sick to my stomach. I'm no shrinking violet and adore Hong Kilm action films. A very ugly tale of revenge and brutality with plenty of gore. The rape scene was horrific and seemed to last forever - I ended up skipping this scene. I cannot believe this film garnered as much acclaim as it did. Brutal, brutal picture.
B00018D44U|5.0|I have heard Norah Jones' second album \\"Feels Like Home\\" criticised for not being up to par with her debut album \\"Come Away With Me\\". While that may be true, this is still an amazing album. Besides how can someone be expected to match something as successful as Norah's debut? <br /> <br />Like I said, this is a great album. But don't assume that because you enjoyed \\"Come Away With Me\\" you will be an instant fan of \\"Feels Like Home\\" as well. While her debut was deeply rooted in jazz, her new album moved slightly away from that and more into country. It takes some getting used to, but in the end it is the same lovable, enchanting voice. <br /> <br />\\"Feels Like Home\\" displays a wide array of genres and moods, showcasing how talented Norah and The Handsome Band are. The first single from the album \\"Sunrise\\" is a light-hearted, jazzy tune while others such as the upbeat \\"Creepin' In\\" featuring Dolly Parton are much more country. There are also soft ballads such as \\"Humble Me\\". The different genres blend beautifully to create what I see as one of the must have albums this year.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|this movie is said to be about drug addiction, although after watching it multiple times u find the addiction of everything. The tv, love, chocolate, the diet, and the always wanting that little bit more (money or that last dropped pound or herion hit or diet pill)  my life has changed from this movie  go rent it right now and watch it and just experience reality first hand
0375422889|5.0|Anyone who has read Persepolis: The Story of a Childhood has undoubtedly looked forward to reading any future material from this talented author/artist. Marjane Satrapi possesses a unique skill of profound biographical storytelling and inventive artwork. In her first graphic novel Satrapi remarkably recounted her childhood of growing up in Tehran during the Islamic Revolution. Her liberal middle-class parents helped shape her perceptions of the world and encouraged her to reach her potential regardless of the multiple barriers that limit her everyday choices and actions. It quickly becomes apparent that Marjane is deeply proud of her country but simultaneously saddened by the actions of the fundamentalist Islamic government. <br /> <br />PERSEPOLIS 2: THE STORY OF A RETURN picks off where Persepolis 1 ended. Marjane is sent by her parents to study in Vienna, Austria to escape the bombings and uncertainty of the Iran-Iraq War. As she integrates herself into her new life she experiences a sense of lost identity as she straddles between the West and Iran. Her steadfast pride of being Iranian continues in the face of prejudice and misinformation. Although she has physically grown up her intensity remains. <br /> <br />I was very fortunate to meet Marjane Satrapi at a book reading two nights ago. She is both articulate and compassionate about her life and her perceptions of current geopolitical events. Also, she was very funny and had the audience laughing many times at her varied quirkiness. Her life story is inspirational and sticks with you long after her books are put back on the shelf. Highly recommended!
0141439785|5.0|Michael Henchard (yep - - later he's the Mayor, all right), having sold his wife and baby early in the novel for 5 guineas while in a drunken rage, gets what he deserves despite his valiant efforts at atonement years later after an initial rise in fortune and a 'chance' reunion with his long-abandoned wife and daughter.  Not that an example of Divine retribution is Hardy's intention; Hardy was an atheist.  But he stacks the cards so heavily against Henchard that it's hard to believe he isn't a True Believer after all.  Chance?  Irony? Coincidence?  (Synchroncity??  Gadzooks!)  Divine retribution?  All grist for Hardy's deterministic mill, and a grinding mill it is for Henchard.  It ultimately doesn't matter - - to prove his point Hardy orchestrates the narrative so obviously and nothing can stop Henchard's downward spiral, of course.  Everywhere in the novel, it's plain he's doomed.  Hardy created this character whose final wish, as Hardy has him spell out in his will, is that he be forgotten.  And then Hardy titles the novel after him for the ages.  Did I hear someone say 'Omniscient Narrator'?  Pretty divine, I'd say.
0676973760|3.0|I liked the story, it's cute, but not life changing, as I had come to expect from the TV interviews with Mr. Martel and reviews I read.  It's a fairy tale for adults.  I recommand it if you want to read something to relax.
B0002ZDVEU|5.0|This one was very good despite the shakey camera work (bring on the steady-cam). Seeing Karl Urban as an assassin was a nice touch since he's a great actor and very under-used.
B0001GL3K4|1.0|I am writing this review from the point of view of someone who lives in London, United Kingdom. I write it to the Americans out there who will read this; you who have made some of the finest films in history. I must ask you not to be taken in by this ghastly nonsense. There is nothing remotely new in this film than that which you will have seen in any romantic comedy that has gone before. More importantly though - THIS IS NOT ENGLAND. LONDON IS NOT LIKE THIS. WE ARE NOT REPRESENTED BY THIS AWFUL FILM. London's population is highly cosmopolitan and diverse. There are many coloured people in this city, and we are not all middle class and white. This film is the hiatus of Richard Curtis land - a place where it often snows, everything turns out well, everyone makes jokes, and there is not a black/asian face to be seen. This land is not ours; it is embedded in the mind of Curtis.  <br />The simple notion that love conquers all and will sooth us is mundane to the point of death. Love causes an awful lot of problems as well. Terrorists love their ethos, faith, and lands so much that they commit terror... <br />Not forgetting that oaf Billy Bob Thornton's representation of your own president. Would have been nice to see a reasonable interpretation of your country's leader. You've had Lincoln, Wilson, Roosevelt, Truman - lets forget the present for now, ok. Now you've got Billy Bob (how did gorgeous Angeline Jolie ever see anything in this average-looking idiot). <br />Please turn away from this for your own sakes. If you do invest in this turkey, know when you watch it that you are watching something that is the opposite of what it means to live in Britain.
B00005O5CM|5.0|Laughing out loud funny. Sweet. Nice people winning in the end.  <br />This is a movie of the \\"summertime popcorn\\" tradition. Don't try to analyze it legally, socially, sexually, etc., and just enjoy the happy goofiness.  <br /> <br />No it's not realistic. If a beautiful blonde in a Porsche shows up at the law school dorm, no guys are going to make \\"Malibu Barbie\\" jokes, because they'll be tripping over their tongues to get a closer look. This is just one of a thousand things that aren't realistic or plausible in the movie. So what!? <br /> <br />A girl gets crushed by a jerk. Pulls herself up by her own bootstraps (color coordinated and in the correct fabric, of course). Makes it \\"her way\\". And her way happens to be an honest, principled, hard working way. She has a lot of luck and wins in the end, while both delivering lines any \\"cosmo girl\\" would be proud of, and realizing that the jerk who dumped her wasn't worth what she went through, but it was a good thing after all. <br /> <br />Life pretty much never works out that way, but man, wouldn't it be great? It's just a fantasy. Enjoy it like the \\"Princess Bride\\" or \\"Stripes\\". <br /> <br />Full disclosure: I'm a self employed male divorced parent, 15 year consulting engineer/programmer; i.e. I'm pegging the anal retentive meter. If I can love this movie, anyone can. Just \\"lighten up Francis\\".
B000002UZU|4.0|Hooker n' Heat is a great collaboration between white blues players and the Hook (in my opinion, the best blues singer of all time).  The recording is raw, stripped down and meaty.  Reverb wasn't even added to John Lee's vocals or most of the instruments for that matter, which makes me think of After the Goldrush by Neil Young, also a profoundly stripped down record made the same year.  Because of its simplicity, this album sounds very different than the Hook's famous late 50's, early 60's work. <br /> <br />My only complaint is that some of the album's songs should have remained out.  The album could have been a great single disc.  Most of the first disc is John improvising, getting warmed up to boogie the next day.  Aside from \\"Burning Hell\\" \\"Messin with the Hook\\" and a couple of others, these first songs sound like exercises rather than organized material.  The album probably should have been arranged as a 12 song single disc and still kicked butt, but I imagine Heat wanted a double album, and had to work with what they had in the end. Hook even tells the producer to take \\"nothin' but the best and later for the garbage.\\"   <br /> <br />Nonetheless it still stands as an awesome collaboration.  And I do enjoy the eccentric rambling between tracks, it gives insight into John's personality.  Too bad Alan Wilson committed suicide right after recording this record, Wilson and the Hook could've made great records for years. Long live the Hook   <br /> <br />
B0001EBXBK|5.0|Quentin knows how to make the best movies....and this is the perfect example of his talent as a film maker.
B00006RU5B|3.0|Here we have the remaining members of \\"Rage Against The Machine\\" minus Zack de la Rocha, with \\"Soundgarden's\\" Chris Cornell on lead vocals. The instrumentals on this album are nothing short of phenomenal. I was amazed to hear Chris Cornell belting out a high range of vocals after all these years. Tom Morello's guitar playing is remarkably inventive. The production is near perfect. With all of that said, there are a few things about the album that I don't like.<br /><br />There are a range of colliding influences here. First you have \\"Soundgarden's\\" 70s metal/punk Seattle grunge sound. Then you have \\"Rage Against The Machine's\\" very modern, hip-hop influenced guitar, with Zack de la Rocha addressing his political views. These bands come from completely different worlds. The result of the mix leaves behind a confusing unfocused effort. Several of the songs work well on there own, but as a full album; it tends to a bit monotonous. That is why this album does so well on the radio; which brings me to my second point. This album was over-played at nausea. I can't tell you how many times I've heard \\"Like A Stone\\", \\"Cochise\\" and \\"I Am the Highway\\" on the radio. I did like these songs, until I couldn't get away from them. Ultimately, this is one of those albums that you pick up and listen to several times, thinking it's great, then realizing that it's mediocre. When I listen to the CD now, I'm just disappointed with what I thought was a masterpiece.

0688078958|2.0|This book consists of a series of essays about various aspects of English. On the whole, the book is well-balanced between describing British and North American varieties of English. The writing style is quite fluid and the book is, for the most part, very enjoyable to read. However, Bryson was not always careful about the quality of his scholarship; he often gets his facts confused or repeats \\"factoids\\" that are known to be false. On page 14, for instance, he makes reference to the old Eskimo snow vocabulary myth, claiming that Eskimos have 50 words for snow (see The Great Eskimo Snow Hoax for a more accurate account). On p. 107 he manages to associate the Martha's Vineyard pronunciation research with Trudgill instead of Labov. Since he makes so many errors, a reader can't tell for certain whether the remaining material is trustworthy. Readers of this book may find themselves more misinformed than informed.
B00000DCHI|5.0|For me, Billy Joel wrote most of his best tunes in the time period during which this two-disc collection of his first two volumes of GREATEST HITS covers. I've always been a big admirer of his '70s hits, and most of my personal favorites are here, including \\"New York State of Mind\\", \\"The Stranger\\", \\"Just the Way You Are\\", and especially his great \\"Scenes from an Italian Restaurant\\". I've never found his '80s or '90s hits to be quite as consistently terrific (personally, I find \\"We Didn't Start the Fire\\" kinda overrated), but at least this collection has perhaps one of the best of his later hits, the ambitious and moving \\"Allentown\\".    So I give this set five stars, and yet I am bothered by one thing about this release: why on Earth does this GREATEST HITS collection contain slightly edited versions of both \\"Just the Way You Are\\" and \\"My Life\\"? \\"Just the Way You Are\\" starts fading out about twenty seconds sooner than it did in its original release in THE STRANGER, and there is a brief but unmistakable edit of a few bars towards the end of \\"My Life\\". Some may see this as niggling, but I am still rather bothered by the reasoning behind releasing cut versions of two very good pop hits.    I would also be remiss not to mention the two songs written expressly for GREATEST HITS VOL. II, \\"You're Only Human (Second Wind)\\" and \\"The Night is Still Young\\". Neither of them really match the highs of his best work, but they are enjoyable nevertheless. (I prefer the lyricism of \\"Night\\".) Certainly, neither of them is enough to undermine a recommendation for this good collection of some true songwriting classics from Billy Joel in his prime.
B00005JMFQ|1.0|A lot of my friends liked this movie, but I think that most of those who did were exactly those people who one would guess liked romantic comedies but who in reality dislike most such films. I don't know what that says about them or about the movie, but for my part I can say that I usually enjoy movies of this genre and thought this one was dreadful. <br /> <br />First, there's nothing \\"romantic\\"--nor, especially \\"comic\\"--about adultery, which is a prevailing theme across the film's many storylines. Indeed, the dizzying volume of characters would be fine if the minor storylines (mostly cute and harmless) weren't overpowered by the repulsive and distasteful major storylines about tempted prime ministers and cheating husbands. (And of course, a wronged Emma Thompson. Don't look so shocked.) <br /> <br />And also, much has been made of the uber-happiness of the ending, but I didn't actually find it that thrilling--the various storylines collude in a way that is neither interesting nor useful at adding any substance to the \\"plot,\\" and the sheer bluntness of it all makes you feel more like someone screamed \\"Be Happy!\\" rudely in your face than that you have actually enjoyed yourself. <br /> <br />If you're a romantic comedy person, you'll probably see this film at some point or another regardless--it certainly has its fans. I just hope that you don't end up being one of them.
B0002KVUKW|5.0|This film not only had a great cast, Hugh Jackman and Kate Beckinsale, just to say a few. It delivered on its promises 110%. It kept me on the edge of my seat with its non stop action and quick witted humor. I say it's about time someone dug up some of the classic horror monsters. Hugh Jackman did beyond a great job as Van Helsing.<br /><br />I say Van Helsing is a must see for horror and nonhorror fans alike.There is something for everone. You won't be dissappointed.
B00006BTCA|5.0|I have high expectations for their next album due out in a few weeks.  Yes, this album is good, that is all there really is to it.  After having this album for a year now, I can still blare it on my car stereo and get that warm nervous energy when I drive.  I can sense so much potential for this band, and I hope they can just focus it.  They really do remind me of Joy Division, mostly the vocals and the raw nature of their sound.  I can't see anyone with an open mind, not liking this album.
B00005JMXX|1.0|What the hell is wrong with you american movie makers??? <br />Romance in a movie about global catastrophy. I mean, come on people! Why do you alweays have to have love in your movies? Is it really what people want?  <br /> <br />A good movie toutches your emotions, or at least is should. I felt nothing. Nothing!  <br />And what about them wolves? Nah, i'm not even gonna comment that... <br /> <br />If it was possible to rate the movie with zero stars, that would have been my choise. Now I give it one star and that will represent the issue with how we treat the globe. That must come to an end.
B0000019PA|5.0|There are certain albums and bands that are forgettable, and some that are truly unforgettable that kinda change your life in some small way.  Neutral Milk is the latter.  If you are thinking about getting this album, just get it, even at full price.  True Genius has no price.  King of the Carrot Flowers Pt. 1 will get you hooked long enough for the rest of the album to grow on you.  Get past the whininess of his voice, and you'll eventually hear it as passionate and real.  I would recommend anything Mr. Magnum touches.  Really wish he would make another album for all us addicts.  This would be your best choice of albums to get introduced into his world.
B000286S8S|5.0|The 2 Disc set is awesome!!!But there is a problem with one of the songs!!!!!.On the first disc ,Track#6(Finish what ya started).The Track is incomplete.This is incredible and I cannot belive that the executive producer of this album could not have seen this.Apart from this the set is a great collection.By the way.............Try to catch them in concert if you can , I saw them last saturday and they ROCKED!!!                                         Thanx . Z
B0001ENYKS|3.0|I kinda like it, but I don't know what's so good about them.  I really tried to listen for it, read the lyrics for it, just get a feel for it, but it really isn't there for ME.  Obviously there has to be something there, cause lots of people are saying, \\"best album of the year,\\" \\"best band out of Britain\\" and on and on.  To me they sound like a redundant less catchy Strokes.  There are certainly some enjoyable and cool moments, but in the end I still don't even feel good about spending the $9.99 I spent to buy it at Circuit City.  In my opinion, The Strokes, Interpol, and the Kinks (many of the bands they are compared to) are far far better in every way.  I can't stand bands who have lyrics that are incoherent at any level, and just aren't intelligent.  To me, the Emperor Has No Coat.
0962477060|4.0|As others have mentioned, this is a book unlike others.  There are books on music theory, books on riffs and chords, books on technique etc, but this is probably the only good book on the fretboard itself.    The CAGED system introduced here is very useful for moving chord shapes around and more importantly, to move all around the fretboard while soloing.   What more, this CAGED approach can be used for any other scales that you can think of and not just for the ones shown in the book.  All other concepts such as modes etc are introduced with this system. This is unlike other books, where such concepts are usually presented in an abstract and not specifically for guitar.      A highly recommended book for a beginner or an intermediate player or anyone who gets bogged down with all those \\"helpful\\" dots on the fretboard. This book can be used for whatever style of music you are interested in as long as its on the guitar ! .
B00003CXCT|2.0|I think we all agree. All of us just want the original version of the Star Wars to be made available on DVD. We all know what made Star Wars work. George Lucas was a young,up & coming  film maker with a very cool vision of something he knew none of us had ever seen before. special effects were not yet capable to handle the level of his own visions, so what does he do? He invents those effects!!! He puts together a company that produces the most technologicly advanced, never before seen special effects to date. And guess what? They worked! They worked to perfection! The first time all of us(the world I mean)saw our first showing of Star Wars we were all blown away! Am I right? It not only forever changed the way films were made,it was like...finally I knew what I wanted to do with my life...Special effects!!!  I had no idea what I was watching up there, I only knew that there was all of this really cool stuff on the screen and I was in love! I coulden't take it all in at once!I was still finding new stuff after many many showings. It was like being a new born baby when everything in the world is brand new. It was the first time in history that multible showings were going to be a must for everyone. And George Lucas did it all for less than ten million dollars.(that's unheard of today) That was another reason it was so great, they all(Lucasfilm LTD.) had to actully work to be creative and inventive! The new editions of Star Wars,Empire,and Return of the Jedi suffer from the exact same things that make Phantom and clones barfable. George Lucas dosen't know when to put the brushes down. There's just way too much crap on the screen at one time! Mr Lucas? If you do dicide to finally make episodes VII,VIII & IX in the future, will you please do your fans a huge favor?.... Listen to us, were trying to set you straight! Do yourself a favor and get rid of all the yes men you have kept so close by your side for all these years, they're killing you! Three little words George and I'll shut up. Less is more... <br /> <br />JBW
B000053VAF|5.0|Dogma is about 2 angels that are band from heaven. They find a way to get back to heaven but if they do get back they will end existence so 2 prophets (Jay and Silent Bob a.k.a. Kevin Smith) have to stop the angels before they reach the destination.  This is one of the greatest movies Kevin Smith ever made actually all his movie's were great.All his movies are sure to make the most serious on their knees laughing.
B0002O06N0|5.0|I hear these people banging around upstairs from me all the time. So one day I get interested and I talk to him, Pat. he was pretty nice, and he taught me to play the Nintendo. His wife (or whatever...some mexican girl he lives with) made me hamburgers that tasted just like Burger King. Anyway, this is a great album, with lots of songs and also cover art that shows the things near my house. I have almost bought it, but I don't have a job and thus can't buy luxury items such as Black Keys albums and Persian carpets. Anywho, you know what I say!
B0002IQHY8|5.0|This is the best CD Alan ever has produced! You will like it or you will hate it. I LOVE it! \\"We play the game\\" with the fantastic voice of AP, the opener \\"Return to T.\\" with the slide-guitar of David Gilmour. All of the songs are brilliant. The cd is just a little bit too short. Go on Alan, it's the right path!
B00003CXBK|5.0|Though the title of this film can be a turn-off for many potential viewers, \\"Princess Mononoke/ Mononoke Hime\\" is certainly not one to be missed.  <br /> <br />\\"Princess Mononoke\\" is a powerful tale of war, hate, and love.  The heroism it displays shines with a strange sense of justice and humility, which sets a very interesting mood for western viewers who are more accustomed to cinematic interpretations of somewhat boastful legends (i.e. Troy).  Though regardless of the viewer's ethnicity, the intense moods, beautiful scenery, interesting symbols, deep characters, and unforgettable plot are almost sure to come down as a moving weight on the tasteful movie-watcher.

B000002OX7|5.0|It was hard for me to believe that the original \\"Who's Next\\" could be improved upon.  But it was done here.    The sturm und drang of the original release is hard to top; it reveals each of the band's musicians at the top of his form.  It's Townshend's masterpiece of concision, violence, delicate sensitivity and stylistic mastery.  Everyone else in the band played a lead instrument, and the original album has maybe the greatest moments of each, from Roger Daltrey's piercing vocals to John Entwistle's rumbling melodic runs up and down the fretboard (and one of his best songs) to Keith Moon's Wagnerian omnipresence on drums.      What's best about this expansion?  Well, pretty much everything.  The liner notes provide an inside view of the process which, fortunately for us rock fans, produced \\"Who's Next\\" rather than the monster fermenting in Townshend's head at the time.  (The notes provide some nice pics too, including maybe the best one I ever saw of the band in concert, maybe worth the purchase price by itself.)  The additional songs - long-lost studio gems and concert outtakes not easy to find elsewhere - stay right on mood and sound like natural extensions of the process that produced one of rock's all-time best records.    The Who were a great BAND - an ensemble that brought out the best in one another when it mattered.  Here's another superb document, made better by some adroit tinkering.
B00003CXCT|5.0|This trilogy is, by far, one of the most popular and influential trilogies of all movie history. A New Hope especially pushed the envelope. So many things were created out of A New Hope that now are a standard in Hollywood. Industrial Light and Magic, a small company George Lucas, creator of Star Wars and director of 4 of the films, created to make some special effects never done before. Now, ILM is the special effects company for most movies requiring extensive special effects. But the special effects is only a small part of it. Also, aliens in movies now tend not to look so humanoid. Star Wars changed that. Add to that the incredible music done by John Williams, and the intense story and great character development, and what's not to like? This trilogy is one of the great trilogies of Hollywood, right up there with the Lord of the Rings trilogy and The Matrix trilogy and the Back to the Future trilogy. And, probably the most amazing thing about these movies, is these movies are still watched and hailed by millions all over the planet. How many other movies made in the 70s are still watched with great entusiasm today? How many other early to mid 80s movies are watched with vibrant excitement? Answer: very few. These movies, though, were made in those times, and are still thoroughly enjoyed in every way. Oh, and to all those that want to watch I, II, and III before seeing IV, V, and VI: I highly recommend seeing IV, V, and VI before seeing I, II, and III. Jokes in the prequels will refer to things in the original trilogy, and lots of connections will appear in the prequels helping you understand the first three movies. And, the big surprise at the end of V won't surprise you if you've seen the prequels first. Trust me folks; these movies will be enjoyed for many, many years to come.
0805076476|5.0|This book is amazing.  The writting is amazing, the pace is amazing, the themes are amazing.  The only reason why some see this book as being crude is because it's so brilliantly honest.  The movie is just as great.  I wish I could read it again like it was the first time.
074325144X|5.0|I am forty years old and ran my first half marathon in February of this year. After the race my body basically broke down. I had intense shin splints, knee pain, joint pain, etc. I could no longer even run a mile and a half without having to stop. I have been completely frustrated because running is one of my great joys and is something that I do to clear my head. A couple weeks ago my friend did an interview with Danny Dreyer and she was kind enough to let me borrow her copy of The Chi of Running and I read it right away. I was enthralled by the book and it gave me renewed hope and I have been incorporating the priniciples as much as possible. I must say it has been a bit of a struggle with the technique because I have always been a heavy foot plodder thus my injuries.  But last week I went on a run and incorporated as much as I could and I ran eight miles and felt so strong at the end I couldn't believe it! I felt I could have easily ran a couple more miles. I still am experiencing pain wth my legs but I truly believe that if I follow the principles of the Chi of Running then one day I will be injury free!
B00003CXCT|5.0|Great movies, but don't kid yourself.  You've seen them before, and you'll see them again.  Lucas is releasing these now, instead of after Episode 3 comes out because by then, there will be a new DVD format (BluRay) and lucas will have missed the chance to cash in a few more Hundred million dollars with the current format.  Blu Ray releases in 2006/2007.  Can't fault him though, I'd do it.    EDIT:  Who knew lucas would release these at least 2 more times on the DVD format.
B00003CXCT|1.0|Anyone that likes the idea of the new \\"improvements\\" on the Star Wars dvds doesn't really appreciate the originals.  George Lucas didn't have the money or technology for flashy special effects, so he relied on a solid story, and (for the most part) good acting.  That is why his movies are as popular as they are.  It is not because of special effects, and there is just no need to put in new scenes.  Even if they weren't that good, it would be understandable if Lucas wanted to put in scenes he had to leave out in '77.  But these are new and unneeded additions.  My personal opinion is \\"if it ain't broke, don't fix it.\\" <br /> <br />I wouldn't even care about this release either, if Lucas was offering the originals as well.  But since he decided to pursue this holy quest for the \\"perfect\\" Star Wars, I have decided not to buy this dvd set, and to let my friends and family know not to buy it.
B0002IU988|5.0|In this album, which shows the talents of Mark Tremonti and Scott Phillips, this band shows they can go on without Scott Stapp. In fact, Alter Bridge rock, rock may be an understatement. If you want to hear rock music that is not of cookie cutter caliber, check these guys out. Scott Stapp may want to re think the departure because I believe Alter Bridge will be around for quite some time. Similarities between Creed and Alter Bridge are minimal. Check these guys out, they rock!
B00003CXCT|5.0|Now I understand why Lucas waited so long to release this on dvd. He knew if he waited it would sell more and cause a big freenzy like the tickle me elmo dolls did a while back. I mean why else its not like he was going to surpass these movies.
0767840135|5.0|Cirque du Soleil's production of \\"Quidam\\" is the most spectacular stage show that I have ever seen.  There are moments that literally take your breath away as the cast seem to defy gravity with outstanding acts of strength and balance.<br /><br />\\"Quidam\\" is so much more than a circus act.  It is a grand show that is part musical, part dance show and part magic.  The end result, however, is even more than the sum of the parts.  If one were to try to list the highlights of the show, one would have great difficulty.  Each component is magnificent in its own right.<br /><br />The cast is drawn from all over the world yet the performance speaks just one language.  Fantastic and compelling!  The search for superlatives is a task in itself.<br /><br />See this show!  Buy this DVD!
B00005JMUA|5.0|Kill Bill vol.1 was an instant classic and vol.2 brillantly continues the story. Vol.1 was the questions and Vol.2 was the answers.  I have enjoyed all of the Tarantino flicks and these two signal a change in his career.  Almost instantly from cult to mainstream I am pretty shure in the not so distant future he will become as much of a household name as Steven Speildberg.
B000089RVX|3.0|I have enjoyed Evanescence's music from the moment I first heard their song \\"Bring me to Life\\" on the radio. I was amazed to hear the very distinct vocals lead singer Amy Lee contributes, paired with the harder rock sound of the band. The two sounds were very distinct and different, however when they were blended, the result was awesome.  <br /> I then purchased the album with an extremely optimistic attitude and expected to be impressed. However, after listening to the album a few times, I wasn't as impressed as I thought I would be. It's not that they aren't good musicians; it's just that almost every song on the album sounds exactly the same. They all consist of Amy's unsettling vocals atop of a rather talented, yet repetitious band. It's definitely something you can imagine listening to in a psychological horror movie, where they play the music to get your heart beating fast. Amy's voice can instantly send chills down your spine. However, after listening to all eleven songs, it's hard to distinguish one from the other because there is nothing that really differentiates them. I only really think of the CD as a whole - Other than the singles that are released on the radio, I can't think of one individual song.  <br /> I have very high esteem for them lyrically however. Their songs cover some of the darkest issues of the human mind: love, hate, rape, abuse, suicide, death, and many others. The unique thing about it however, is the songs aren't bitter diatribes or whining about how horrible life is. Their attitude seems to be that of empathy - as if they were saying to their public \\"Hey, we know you go through this tough stuff, we do too. We just want you to know you are not alone.\\" They offer the difficult issues that are commonly dealt with, but with an encouraging message along with it. It's almost ironic how their music can be about such horrible things, yet it gives a sense of hope and redemption rather than that of depression and hatred.  <br /> Some people have tried to label them as being a \\"Christian band,\\" and criticize them for their hypocrisy. Some of their songs have spiritual implications, like found in the song \\"Tourniquet,\\" but the song isn't necessarily \\"Christian.\\" They write about issues that they deal with, and spirituality is one of them. So mention of God is found in their songs, but it's not the preachy type of way Christian music tends to sometimes be. The song is not necessarily promoting Christianity, but it is telling a story of an experience where God seemed to be the answer.    <br /> So overall, musically, if you like the sound of one song, you will like the whole album, just don't expect anything else. Lyrically, expect to be listening to the deeper, darker side of the human soul as Evanescence brings up some of the hardest issues we can deal with. The overall message is a positive one, and the music is actually relatively well written, so if you don't mind be a little creeped out while listening to the album alone in your car, it's an all around unique album that you need to buy to for the experience.  <br />

0609610570|3.0|The book really lays down the fundamental process for effective execution.  Of course, as in reading any business books, the rules of the game cannot be fixed, and readers must be able to select, adapt, and improvise. <br /> <br />One key principle preached in this book is about \\"people\\" process - putting the right people to the right job.  Readers must note that, after the failed M&A attempt between Honeywell and one GE's business, Honeywell CEO was pinpointed, and some said that he was not the right man for the job.  Larry himself did not give any lesson learned from this case in the book at all. <br /> <br />Lastly, managing \\"people\\" process appears too simple and straightforward by this book.  It does not mention the essential fact that human mind is complex.  And, as a CEO, you need to find ways to inspire and win employee's trust & belief, before you can move them into actions & executions.
0156027321|1.0|I bought this book on the recommendation of GMA's \\"book club\\", of which I have read and enjoyed numerous selections.  After starting to read this a couple of times, I finally got serious, thought there was some potential but it was tedious at best.   <br /> <br />A young boy, a Bengal tiger, a lifeboat with a raft in the Pacific Ocean for 227 days encountering all of mother nature's gifts - and reviewers say this is believable - no I dare say I don't think so.  I understand that fiction doesn't have to be believable, but this story just doesn't flow well.  To me the story rambles on day after monotonous day.  I got to the point of skimming some of it just to get through yet another day of survival.  Overall, not a book I would recommend. <br />
0375703764|3.0|... namely, is it enjoyable? Even the reviewers here who loved it acknowledge that parts of it are painfully boring. Me, I found about half of it painfully boring, and maybe a third just painful. The seed story about the house is interesting and slightly spooky, and some of Zampano's discourses are interesting but the Johnny Truant narrative was abysmal. Oversexed, overwrought, over the top, just bad in every way. Meandering, incoherent, self-indulgent, and most of all, dull. I kept accidentally skipping lines of his sections because he barely made sense even when I was reading every word. <br /> <br />The structural ideas are interesting, kind of. I don't think they are particularly original. While it's not common to play with font color and prints in adult literature, it's extremely common in children's. Just think of \\"The Very Hungry Caterpillar.\\" I also thought it many cases the concepts simply didn't work. Reading a bunch of words squeezed into a tiny box on the page didn't make me feel squeezed, or really add anything to my experience besides annoyance at having to flip the page every second. <br /> <br />Let me make a comparison to Escher's work. Escher's work plays with your perspective and makes you think, but it's also just plain old nice to look at. The cleverness is secondary to the aesthetics. So this book fails as a fun brain teaser, and it also fails as all overly cerebral art does: it doesn't move you. It is so busy playing tricks and setting traps that there's no time to build up any of the characters or touch you in any way. I didn't even find it scary, though obviously a lot of people did. <br /> <br />I do have a couple comments and question for other reviewers. First, I noticed on a few pages that there were check marks or extra digits (I remember a 7 in particular). Any significance there? There was also a weird typo in Tom's story right before the house eats him: the text says that he probably would have drank all night if something hadn't stopped *me*. I thought the author didn't just hint that Johnny Truant had created Zampano, but that Zampano had in turn created Johnny Truant - Zampano makes a couple of references to creating a son, which kind of goes with the whole Minotaur theme.
B000005RT8|5.0|This is one of McCartney's most bold attempts to retain his pop audience and break into new territory.  As disco was winding down and punk was rapidly doing likewise, and with New Wave still a year away, Paul streched his non-stop creative powers and developed a double album.  Whittled down to a single album at Columbia's insistence (as was \\"Tug of War\\"), the album is a fine exploration of the technology of the time.  It also benefits from some of Paul's best musicianship since he left that other band ten years earlier.<br /><br />\\"Coming Up\\" was of course the hit (actually, double hit, as both the studio version and live version topped the charts in 1980) but the gems are in the slightly more experimental tracks.  \\"Temporary Secretary\\" is one of those perfect hate-it-or-love-it tracks that only Paul seems able to compose.  \\"On the Way\\" is a fine, slick and edgy blues rocker, featuring a brilliant guitar solo.  \\"Waterfalls\\" is charmingly plain, in its instrumentation and lyrics.  \\"Nobody Knows\\" is a nice one-man warm-up exercise, and indeed nobody knows what the song is actually about.<br /><br />For all the love foisted on Lennon's 1980 offering, McCartney is the one who truly (and effortlessly) is pushing the boundaries of pop.  The instrumentals and truly loopy recordings (\\"Front Parlour\\", \\"Frozen Jap\\", \\"Check My Machine\\", \\"Special Friend\\") are downright creative.<br /><br />Keep in mind that, in 1980, one couldn't switch on a drum machine and record along with it.  For all of these songs, Paul played drums to no accompaniment first (in the case of \\"Special Friend\\", he did so for 10 minutes), layering other instruments and creating songs like he would eventually layer and create his artwork.<br /><br />By the time pop caught up to this sound, Paul was off on another musical tangent, proving himself to be neither leader nor follower.<br /><br />Incidentally, on a personal level, this album and Stevie Wonder's \\"Songs in the Key of Life\\" were the inspiration for me to eventually learn drums, bass, guitar, keyboards, harmonica and jew's harp.on for me to eventually learn drums, bass, guitar, keyboards, harmonica and jew's harp. <br /> <br />
B00005JMAH|3.0|My young children even noticed that something was not right! Hagrids house is not down the hill from the school. You need to get the old sets and filming areas back. My youngest stated that you made Professor Dumbledore look like one of the \\"bag people living under the bridge in the city\\". In movie 1 & 2 Professor Dumbledore was clean, dignified, a gentleman, dressed like royalty and was quiet spoken. In movie three he was loud, had black fingernails and grubby clothes, I didn't even know it was Dumbledore at first. If I had been casting I would have gotten Christopher Lloyd, he could have steped right into the part and looked like the original and would have given the part the class it required. You need to get Chris Columbus back or find someone who will \\" stick to the book and previoue movies\\" You cannot fool children, children are not dumb, Harry Potter is their hero. They can tell you the whole first 2 movies in their sleep.
B000002J6F|5.0|This album rocks...that is all. If you want to hear some sweet rock, get this album. I first heard it in casette form in my cousin's car out in Arkansas. I was blown away. The guitar..even the vocals...the catchy melodies; sick! I ordered the CD and then proceeded to listen to this masterpeice constantly. The quality of the CD is excellent.  <br /> <br />Basically, get this CD, you will not be dissapointed.
B0000TB050|5.0|Ok I wasn't at Slane and I didn't see the DVD but I can remember the huge build-up to the 2 concerts that year.  I just thought I'd help a few of you to get a feel for the occasion and the history of Slane since some of you seem a little misled.  This is probably one of the most amazing concert venues in the world and (until this year - Madonna should be ashamed of herself) has always been a rock venue.  Slane is NOT in Dublin - it is in a tiny village called Slane (funny enough) in Meath which is about an hour and a half drive from Dublin.  The reason I did not go to this concert was that the tickets were literally gold dust - all 80,000 sold out in a matter of minutes, thus the reason for the second show which also sold out in minutes (it had always been a one concert a year venue until that year).  It is estimated though that there were at least 100,000 fans at each show - possibly something to do with the wonderful support acts (one night was coldplay and the other were Red Hot Chile Peppers along with others).  The venue is literally a castle set in a huge field (with a hill and a few trees as meeting points) with the Boyne River in the background and is quite close to the historic ancient Boyne Valley.  There have been quite a few deaths of ticketless fans trying to swim the river to the castle over the years.  The first concert was in 1979 headlined by Thin Lizzy and supported by a, then unheard of, U2 (which is why the DVD is entitled U2 go home.  They HAVE played in Ireland several times in that timeframe, just not in Slane.) And has since been rocked by legends no less than Queen, Springsteen, Neil Young, REM, The Rolling Stones, Bob Dylan, Pearl Jam, Guns N Roses... The list goes on and on.  To the eejit who asked if the crowd have no seats... WHAT???  It's Slane, it's a field, it's a mind-blowing experience, NOT a lesson in comfort.  That's not how we do things here in Ireland anyway.  People camp out the night before and sometimes the following night.It's great if it's hot and sunny but even better if it's wet and mucky.  Anyway apparently they've booked a few nights in the equally legendary Croke Park (HQ of Gaelic football & hurling here in Ireland) for next year and this time I DEFINITELY won't be missing out.
B000268QB2|4.0|I've read most of the other reviews and noted comparisons and can't believe no one has mentioned how much the lead vocals sound like Freddie Mercury of Queen. Sent goose bumps thru me upon first listening. I'm off for a 2nd.... <br />
B00008WG3U|3.0|I expected a lot out of this cd because Fat mike said this was going to be a very political album but it's not that political, it's as political as all of their albums have been. There's a little bit of everything. It's not that great some song are big misses like Anarchy Camp but their are some songs  like 13 stiches, seperation of church , i got two jealous again and skate and franco- unamericangreat. I would get this if you a big NoFX fan but i would get pump up the valium or almost anything else from Nofx before i would get this.
B0002J4X1Q|5.0|It was really funny when this DVD came out because it is titled &quot;Resident Evil: DELUXE EDITION&quot; and in actuality there are more special features on the original release. The only thing one could label &quot;Deluxe&quot; about this edition is that it has a small about a 2 minute clip from Resident Evil 2.<br />So, if you are looking to buy Resident Evil, then its a fun movie. But if your looking for &quot;deluxe special features&quot;, then this is most definately the wrong place.
B0002IQHZM|5.0|It has happened again. Just as it did over 30 years ago when I first heard the album \\"Fairy Tale\\" by Donovan. Back then I had never heard anything quite like it and it started a long love of folk music for me.  <br /> <br />I convinced my parents to buy me \\"A Gift From a Flower to a Garden\\" for my birthday without having heard the album. It was based on my established appreciation of Donovan but when I first put the disc on the turntable I was blown away. These were songs unlike any I had heard before. How could anyone make music so simple and yet so beautiful. Lyrically and musically Donovan had stripped it all down and, in so doing, had created something magical. I was sure it could never get better. <br /> <br />But when I bought \\"Barabajagal\\" I was blown away again. This was the same guy who sang \\"Isle of Islay\\" and \\"Widow with a Shawl\\" now putting together numbers with Jeff Beck that were just astounding. Where did this mix of folk and rock and jazz come from? It was Donovan of course doing what Donovan did best - moving on and trying something new and doing it perfectly.  <br /> <br />He kept this up all through Cosmic Wheels and then something seemed to go wrong. The seventies albums (7-Tease, Essence to Essence, Slow Down World, and Donovan) were starting to sound like work. This was the stuff that said, \\"Time to make an album.\\" There was the occasional bit of brilliance but on the whole they were bland. I figured this was the end of a great career. It seemed to be when Donovan virtually disappeared. <br /> <br />When he released Sutras in 1996 I looked at it and pondered buying it but it had been a long time since I'd heard really good new Donovan work and I passed.  <br /> <br />Fast forward to 2004. I'm driving along the Kansas turnpike when I hear this familiar voice on a song I had never heard before. And the music was tremendous. The announcer came on to say this was from Donovan's new album \\"Beat Caf.\\"  <br /> <br />I went to buy this new CD and couldn't find it at the record store. But I did pick up a copy of Sutras for $4.99. Sutras is a CD I should have bought in 1996 so I could have been listening to it for eight years. It takes Donovan out of his seventies slump and shows us once again the brilliance that made so much great music back in the sixties.  <br /> <br />When I finally found a copy of \\"Beat Caf\\" it took only about the first thirty seconds before I was back just as I was when I first heard \\"Starfish on the Toast\\" or \\"Barabajagal.\\" I was blown away. And not because I was listening to music just like on the earlier albums but because this was Donovan once again going where no one else has been. This album is unbelievable. The muse has not deserted this man, it's just taken him down another road. This is jazz and funk and mysticism all rolled into one. It's my daughter saying, \\"Dad, I didn't know you listened to hip hop.\\" And it is all good. From the jazzy \\"Love Floats\\" to the blues of \\"Lord of the Universe,\\" to the mystical \\"Whirlwind,\\" to the Memphis rockabilly of \\"The Cuckoo,\\" and the hip-hop/rap inspired \\"The Question.\\"  <br /> <br />One of the greatest artists of the sixties is still a great artist today. Buy it!  <br /> <br />I can't say it loud enough. Donovan is still with us and Beat Caf is not just some throwback to an aging pop star's past. It is now and it is great. Put this in the CD player, turn it up and get blown away. <br />
B000000OQF|5.0|<br />This is the best rock album in the last thirty years. I don't think anything comes even close. It's so raw that Gn'r would never be able to top it; I mean how do you top perfection? I think that question ultimately killed the band. Once a band tastes success, the hunger cannot be duplicated. And hunger is what drives this album. <br /> <br />Every song on this album should be on the Greatest Hits album.  <br /> <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />
B000274THQ|5.0|Goodbye Lenin takes a sliver of recent history (reunification of Germany) and weaves it into a tender, bittersweet tale of farce and romance. Presenting a world that no longer exists is hard enough, but making it convincing to the viewer with gentle hints of humour requires a stroke of genius.<br /><br />We may not know of the precise nostalgia felt by East Germans when the products they grew up with were replaced by spiffy modern imports from adjoining nations. But these moments are so beautifully handled, and the son's alternative approaches so cutely frantic, that we cannot avoid relating to similar emotions from our own contexts.<br /><br />The film goes on for a bit in the middle with goofy antics and knowing jokes, but it is richly textured in its nods towards other directors like Fellini and Kubrick.<br /><br />Don't let subtitles put you off from seeing this heart-breaking yet oddly comforting film. One of the best movies I've seen in 2004!
B00005QZ7U|5.0|The reviewers who dissect the film looking for Buddhist symbolism are surprisingly on point and correct about the assertions they make, I think. My only qualm is that I am not so sure mantras is the best way to think about the songs. Buddhism has a rich tradition of poetry devoted to teaching the middle path even through tantra. Mantras are used for meditation and poetry for teaching.
B00003CXRM|4.0|This is one of the funniest films I have seen in years, and it is full of classical references for those of us who studied them.  The acting is also excellent.  Warmly recommended.
B00003CXCT|4.0|First, this is not the best trilogy ever made. I am sorry, but that title has to go to The Lord of the Rings trilogy.  Star Wars is, however, a fantastic science fiction triology.  Most of which is well made.  I won't go into the mirco details...most people have seen these three films.  The Empire Strikes back is the best of the three. A different director and writer...darker, bleaker, and full of edge.  The Return of the Jedi would have been so much better without the cute Ewoks! Just a crass comercial tie in strategy that later haunts the three prequels (both of which are so far inferior, mostly CGI, and terribly convoluted plots with equally silly and terrible dialog, and worse NO PASSION! You don't care about any of the characters)... <br />All in all, a must for any sci-fi fan.  The extras are outstanding and add a lot of information to the lore of Starwars.
B000002J03|5.0|If you are first starting into Zeppelin, and looking for a first CD to get, then look no further. This is \\"the album\\" to buy. This might be one of the greatest records of all time. There are no bad songs on this CD. From Whole Lotta Love to Bring It on Home, each song kicks ass in every way. I recommend this to any classic rock fan. 5 stars hands down!
B00009P1O0|3.0|In the early 1970's, Neil Young was white hot.  His solo career was a critical and commercial success.  Still, I remember several girls in college (for some reason it was always the female types) complaining that their roommates kept playing HARVEST over and over:  \\"I really like HEART OF GOLD; but what's all that other stuff?\\"  Many pulled into a holding pattern with AS TIME FADES AWAY.  But ON THE BEACH is where a lot of people got off the boat.  This is where Young's penchant to \\"head out to a different part of the frontier\\" with each new record became most apparent.  Anticipation of the \\"next\\" Neil Young record became something of a mixed bag because there was no way to know what to expect.  Promised albums could suddenly disappear from his record company's upcoming releases list because Young would change his mind and direction frequently.<br /><br />Young's audience would roughly break down four ways from this point on.<br /><br />1.) There are those who liked his early material but are ill disposed toward anything after AFTER THE GOLD RUSH or HARVEST.  I suppose there is no anger like a love spurned; but the tenacity of this group to hang around to throw brickbats is something to behold.<br /><br />2.) The second group is a comparatively fluid group that consists of fans of one particular album of Young's and practically nothing else.  I have met, for instance, those who absolutely love THIS NOTE'S FOR YOU but have no interest in anything else Young has or will have done.<br /><br />3.) A third group basically blows either hot or cold on individual pieces of Young's outr&eacute;.  Likes and dislikes usually are not confined to a particular album or period.  Rather on a song-by-song basis they either love it or hate it-no in-between.  Sometimes you can find some consistency in what a person likes in Neil Young; but more often what a fan in this group will like defies logical analysis.<br /><br />4.) Then there is that small but dedicated group of die-hards that likes just EVERYTHING Neil does.  Whatever twists and turns our man Neil makes is totally cool with them.  One acquaintance in the record business maintains that they count on this group for the block of sales to follow any new release.  Fans in this group seem to process not just a love of the music as much as a specific sensibility they believe they share with Neil Young himself.  They see Young as the very embodiment of \\"cool\\".  It is as if Young is the living incarnation of the free spirit the late 1960's held as ideal.  As you might expect, this group is totally imbalanced.<br /><br />I myself am a \\"recovering\\" number four.  When I get some distance from my enthusiasm for anything Neil Young I can see it for what it is and accept the fact that there are other types of fans out there and there are perfectly reasonable and sane people who don't care for Neil.  But I fall off the wagon on a fairly regular basis.  Even so, although you would have to pry any and all my Neil Young records out of my dead cold hands, I must admit some are better than others. Some are a whole lot better.<br /><br />If you assume ARC and LANDING ON WATER are at the low end and HARVEST, COMES A TIME and RUST NEVER SLEEPS are at Young's absolute best, ON THE BEACH falls somewhere around the lower middle.  Rather than reaching for some rock and roll \\"high\\" ON THE BEACH just meanders.  Most of its songs belong to a large class of \\"stream of consciousness\\" songs Neil has a habit of writing now and then.  The word \\"blues\\" in three of the eight songs is a tip off we are getting into some pretty bizarre territory where Neil is sorting some things out.<br /><br />This has not stopped some from proclaiming ON THE BEACH as rock classic.  Young actually wanted to release TONIGHT'S THE NIGHT but Reprise didn't want to foul the pool with that black and depressing work.  So we got ON THE BEACH instead and it is bleak enough.  Since the advent of romanticism in the last 19th century, dark moods and emotions have been legitimate subjects for artistic expression.  Rock is nothing if not a grandchild of romanticism and so ON THE BEACH followed by TONIGHT'S THE NIGHT have entitled Young to his perminent gold membership card in the \\"authentic artists club\\" ever since.<br /><br />\\"Walk On\\" :  A small hit in 1974.  Humorous ditty most at the time thought was about the insults Lynyrd Skynyrd threw at Neil in \\"Sweet Home Alabama\\".  It has since been accerted that \\"I hear some people been talkin' me down\\" refers to his former band mates in CSNY.  Anyone who has moved on from their partying days before some of their friends can relate.<br /><br />\\"See The Sky About The Rain\\":  This is an exceptionally picturesque song that The Byrds did much better.  I have always been puzzled why Young does such a minimalist version here and in his concerts.  Yeah, its his song-but I would like to have heard Young's grungy electric guitar workout rather than the weenie Playskool piano sound here.<br /><br />\\"Revolution Blues\\":  The Rolling Stones explored the mind of a rapist in \\"Midnight Rambler\\".  Young goes to the mind of Charlie Manson and family here.  Written too close to the Tate/Sebring/Folger/Parent/Frykowski murders for comfort, \\"Revolution Blues\\" was roundly shunned at the time.  Now every pizza face teenager who can pick and choose his own black clothes thinks he's audacious pretending he's Charles Manson.<br /><br />\\"For The Turnstiles\\": An important song in many's Neil Young canon.  Naked singing over a picked banjo.  Seems to be about the bitter realities of fame.<br /><br />\\"Vampire Blues\\":  Could be about environmental disaster.  Could be a premonition of dark and violent days ahead.  Off shore drilling just honks off Californians.<br /><br />\\"On The Beach\\":  Seems to be deliberately evoking the movie ON THE BEACH in which a small group of people survive a nuclear war only to realize that while the rest of the world is dead they too were doomed to die from resulting poisoning of the earth.  In Young's case, it may be fame and the failure of the 1960's \\"revolution\\" that is poisoning life.  Young wants to \\"head for the sticks\\" and \\"get out of town\\".<br /><br />\\"Motion Pictures (For Carrie)\\":  Carrie Snodgrass was a movie star (Diary Of A Mad Housewife) and Young's girlfriend/living partner.  Seems to be a vision in which Young steps out of his rock and roll role and Snodgrass stepping out of her movie business life and going to a life of quiet togetherness \\"in the mountains\\".<br /><br />\\"Ambulance Blues\\":  This song is a mishmash of various thoughts.  At one point it seems to be about Young's early days of performing before joining Buffalo Springfield, his divorce from his first wife, the Patty Heart kidnapping, the harangue of the critics, and somebody lying right and left.  As Young himself sings, \\"It's hard to say the meaning of this song.\\"<br /><br />Albums written while the artist is in a funk are either exceptionally beautiful or pretty much a drag.  Depression, as odd as it sounds, does have a beautiful aspect apparent only to the sufferer.  It is a small crumb compared to the black feast on one's table; but it is there.  Some can communicate something of this beauty; but most don't have the \\"stuff\\" to do it.  Hints of it glimpses through ON THE BEACH.<br /><br />Still, there is better Neil Young elsewhere.  Neil Young junkies like me eat this stuff up but for the love of Pete don't start here.  Buy several of his best (at least all of the below) before tackling this wonderful, difficult album.<br /><br />1.) Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere<br /><br />2.) After The Gold Rush<br /><br />3.)

B000000P17|5.0|TSI? is an amazing album. Every song is either good or great. Covers or not, Guns N' Roses did a tremendous job here. Nothing to complain about except the infamous \\"Duff song\\" (bassist.) Which is \\"You Can't Put Your Arms Around a Memory\\" where he does the vocals, plays bass, drums, everything and although a nice gesture towards Johnny Thunders (whom he tributes the song to at the beginning), the song is the worst on the album. The vocals make me cringe. <br /> <br />Most critics didn't give this album a chance...and it's a shame. Had there been some actual promotion, maybe the more reknown critics would have given this CD a chance. <br /> <br />Also, \\"Look at Your Game\\", while written by serial killer Charles Manson, is a blatant effort at provoking negative publicity, it's an incredible mellow song. It's a hidden track on this disc (number 12, after \\"I Don't Care About You\\", just wait for it to kick in.)
B00028HBKM|5.0|This movie wasn't about violence, drama, or dialogue.  It simply was a re-enactment of Jesus' sacrifice.  Non-Christians who don't know the \\"Word of God\\" will absolutely get lost in the story.  I know the scriptures, not Hebrew or Latin, and yet I still knew exactly what was being said as well as what was happening in the film.  We only received a small glimpse of Christ's suffering.  It was a gift to see as much of Christ's life as we did with this film. <br /> <br />One should not view this film with the hopes of comparing it to other graphically violent films, but to see if Jesus' story was told accurately.  The venom that I read in some of the negative comments leads me to believe that someone one was moved more than they'd care to share and are left with have one of two options: 1. Change your life and follow Jesus or 2. Keep doing what you're doing and live a life feeling convicted because you know the truth and you are responsible for what you know. <br /> <br />I'm not sure Mel Gibson realized the product that he was to turn out, but I know God knew.  Christians needed a reminder of what love truly means--where love originated and where we as Christians have to set the moral standard in a world where goodness seems to be fading fast.  Mel was just an instrument of God.  The Lord called and he answered.  Good for him and good for us!
B00003CXCT|5.0|I love the original trilogy and have been waiting for like ever to get it on DVD and now next Tuesday it finally comes home on DVD!!  I can't wait for the sneal peek at EPIII.  Love these movies and wish 7,8 and 9 would be made as well.  Hoping doesn't hurt all that too much does it.... <br /> <br />
1577311523|5.0|Just read this book and your life will change. You will hear about this book soon enough in the media. Just read it if you are searching for direction, peace, satisfaction or success -- or all of the above. Just read it.
B00005JNEI|5.0|Fahrenheit 9/11 has been thoroughly dismissed by the Bush administration for its provocative insinuations. Notwithstanding the documentary is a valuable alternate look at a presidential office that has skillfully abused and manipulated information and power. Any impartial observer will be able to detect that the Bush administration has never been nor intends to become forthcoming in sharing the truth with the American people. Fahrenheit 9/11 is a much needed counterweight to the Bush's media campaign of war rhetoric and terror alert propaganda. If you want to become informed and understand both sides of the Bush administration - its public image and private affairs - then Fahrenheit 9/11 is a must see.  <br /> <br />
B00025ETIW|5.0|Recently I picked up MCR's new cd Three Cheers For Sweet Revenge. I thought I should get it because I rememebered their first album having some pretty stellar tracks especially \\"headfirst for halos\\". I was amazed after the frist time I heard this cd. Every song is very catchy, has great musical quality, and some pretty damn good lyrics and storyline throughout the cd. The reason their first cd doesnt even compare is because these tracks are very original and their other cd sounds like any tbs, the used, or any band like those band's cds. Breakdown of tracks: <br /> <br />1. Helena(10/10)-first track of the cd caught me off guard after I listened to the single first. It shows what the rest of the cd besides \\"I'm Not Okay\\" is like. It is extremely catchy and has great lyrics. <br />2. Give 'Em Hell Kid(9.5/10)-another great track that is more fast paced and one of the more shorter songs. if you like good music at all this will be one of your favorite songs the first time you hear it. <br />3. To The End(9/10)-most people will like this song although it has some sort of messed up lyrics. there isnt much else to say about it but that its pretty good. <br />4. You Know What They Do To Guys Like Us In Prison(10/10)- the first time i listened to the album this was instantly my favorite song. it is a lot different from the other tracks( different theme and includes screaming) but many people will enjoy it. <br />5. I'm Not Okay(I Promise)(7.5/10)-you will like this song the first time you hear but eventually you will figure out that this is more like the kind of song that mtv can try to ruin a great band by playing. it doesnt really fit in with the rest of the disc and reminds me more of their first cd. also i think the lyrics arent too good for it. <br />6. The Ghost of You(9.5/10)- this is the slowest track on the album and it is the only ballad but most people will really like it after giving it a few listens. it is also really cool how it combines right into the next song. <br />7. The Jetset Life is Gonna Kill You(10/10)- i love everything about this song( the lyrics, the spanish line, the climax at the end, the piano or whatever it is in the beggining, and the chorus) it is a great song, one of the best <br />8. Interlude(N/A)- you cant really rate this because its not a song, its about a minute long of slow singing with a guitar. most interludes that i've heard arent good so this doesnt dissapoint me at all <br />9. Thank You For The Venom(9.5/10)-another one of the better songs on the album. it has great lyrics and another catchy chorus and i think i would have chosen it for the single because it seems to appeal the greatest to most of the people who like this cd. <br />10. Hang 'Em High(9.5/10)- kind of country in the beggining but i like it so mad specs for the whistle. fastest paced song on the cd although it still has the same type of chorus as the rest(really good) only points off for being too short <br />11. It's Not a Fashion Statement It's a Deathwish(8/10)-alright song, it takes awhile to grow on you. <br />12. cemetery drive(9/10)- slower but still good stuff. once again great lyrics <br />13. I Never Told You What I do For A Living(8/10)- another song that takes awhile for you to like but its pretty good. pretty good ending for a great cd <br />
B00003CXCT|5.0|For those of you who love the first trilogy and the second i am with you. for those of you who believe that george lucas should leave it the way that it was i think you're not getting the concept of star wars, star wars is a movie that is suppose to take you in adventures in outer space, show you new worlds and new characters and through computer technology we can do that today not in the 70's and not even in the mid 90's but today we have reached a technological high that we can practically do anything we want and make it look real. If his changes make all the movies come together as one story then that is how it was meant to be, if the technology makes the movie sets and charachter look more believable then that is how is suppose to be, this is an apple people not an orange you can't compare music with movies but if you must remember the song unforgetable in which case they added the voice of cole's daughter and they made it into a grammy winning song again. Is the artists right to change his work as he pleases until he is satisfied and not not many directors have that freedom or budget, lucas owns industrial light and magic, and if it helps the story and makes the movie that much better then i'm all for it.

B000002I55|5.0|Five AVANT-GARDE Stars. Awesome Beauty, indeed!! In the 60's, Ornette's small quartets and trio's were not enough. When this beautiful album was recorded, he got two outstanding quartets of daring musicians into the studio at the same time. He put one on the left stereo channel and one on the right channel, gave them a structured framework with lots of &#34;free jazz&#34; latitude and turned them loose, with the tape recorders running to catch it all. And the results are Awesome! Seem in the prism of the 21st century, it almost seems tame and serene now, but it set off a firestorm of controversy in the early 60's.<br /><br />There is plenty of individual and collective brilliance, most of it taking place simultaneously, but a curious thing was taking place. The opposite instruments, instead of flying apart in confusion, began to simultaneously &#34;cooperate and anticipate&#34; both the opposite number's intentions and the arc of the entire ensemble flight, twisting and turning in free jazz unison, while not playing the same notes until the structured breaks. And even then, there is a planned delay that stretches similar notes between instruments. (Sorry, that's as close as I can explain something that is almost inexplicable) This is a prime example of the mental telepathy that some musicians seem to have. Coleman, Hubbard, and Dolphy are exceptional, but the interplay of the basses during their collective solo (Wow, Scott Lefaro is a pistol!) and the drums (the cymbal solo in particular) are mesmerizing. Not to be missed by the adventurous jazz fan who can track the collective direction of a free jazz ensemble. A one word review: BEAUTIFUL !!!<br /><br />Post Script: When this album was made, Ornette was the hottest jazz musician alive and the most controversial. His audiences contained a large number of musicians, jazz and classical, struggling to take it all in and hoping they weren't going to miss the train, like many did when BeBop started. The Coltrane controversy paled in comparison to the Ornette Coleman lightning rod. Coltrane started with Earl Bostic &#34;honky-tonk&#34; bands, went more complex with Miles and Monk, and then got even more complex as he leaped into free jazz with no parachute and no intention of coming back. Ornette, however, started complex from the very beginning and headed out of the known solar system. But his music had always had an underlying simplicity and curious poignancy. Other curious musicians followed suit, if only for a short time: Sonny  Rollins, who synthesized a wonderfully inventive take on the &#34;new thing&#34; with &#34;Our Man in Jazz&#34;, using Coleman's rhythm section; and Jackie McLean who had his own particular take on the &#34;cosa nova&#34; with the sizzling &#34;Let Freedom Ring&#34;, among many other more traditional dudes. Thank goodness for Ornette Coleman who had the vision and the guts from the very beginning. My Highest Recommendation. Five CHALLENGING Stars.ersy paled in comparison to the Ornette Coleman lightning rod.

B0002IQHY8|5.0|Alan is truly a progressive artist. Many who claim to be progressive are really just stuck in the past somewhere, trying to find new ways to play nostalgic music. Alan on the other hand, redefined himself in 1993 and now, a decade later, has proven again that *he* is most faithful to the true meaning of the word 'progressive'. Call it techno if you want, but \\"A Valid Path\\" is best described as the greatest Alan Parson's album of all time. Check out David Gilmour's guitar on 'Return' and the Nuendo computer programming by Alan's son Jeremy. Flawless.

The stripped one is twice as good..more raw...it almost feel as Gavin himself is in the room..thats how real and great he sounds...Definitely worthy of a Grammy!! Love, love, love Gavin DeGraw!

I had read books with Drizzt in them before, and found myself wanting to know all about this Dark Elf who came to the surface and was the total opposite of what I knew the Drow to be. Seeing what Drizzt went through, and the odds he faced made me an even bigger fan! Great book for those curious about the past of this Drow Ranger!
B00008MNYS|5.0|The first time, I heard Escapology, I was suprised.  This Robbie is different - more introspective, more willing to share himself with his audience.  I loved it.  These songs are also fun to sing along to, and as a Robbie fan for many years it is nice to know that some things don't have to change.  I recently learned that Guy Chambers will no longer be writing with Robbie, and I am afraid that he will be able to carry on with his success as a songwriter.  What a wonderful swan song for Guy - he should know that this is the best work he and Robbie have ever done.  Robbie's tounge-in-cheek lyrics are coupled with his cocky tone, but it works for him, and that is what I love most about him!  Some of my favourite tracks include the brilliant 'Feel' and the powerful ballad 'Come Undone.'  Amazing stuff, Rob, keep it up.....don't let me down!
B00004YC2F|5.0|This is a beautiful performance of the Rachmaninoff Third, well thought out, finely crafted, lovingly realized.  I had not heard the young Russian pianist Volodos before, and I put on this CD with some trepidation, thinking, \\"Oh boy, here goes another young firebrand virtuoso, trying to out-Horowitz Horowitz, out to razzle-dazzle us into submission with his virtuosity.\\"  But that's not what we get here at all.  Volodos plays with admirable taste, restraint, and lyricism, with poetry and sensitivity, phrases beautifully and plays with handsome, singing tone (he never pounds or bangs).  He has technique to burn and his fingers fly as fleetly as anyone's, but his virtuosity is everywhere at the service of the music (not the other way around, as was so often the case with Horowitz).  (My only quibble, and it is a minor one, is that he sometimes uses more pedal than I would like.)  His goal is to offer the most beautiful performance possible of the concerto, to perform the music to the music's utmost advantage, and not to show off his own big technique.  He plays with remarkable maturity for so young a pianist (he was 27 when the recording was made).  Clearly a young man to watch.   <br /> <br />For their part Levine and the Berlin Philharmonic provide warm, finely gauged, fully sympathetic support--support really isn't the right word here, for a work that has been aptly described as a \\"piano symphony.\\"  The live performance (from the Berlin Philharmonie, June 1999) is captured in fine sound, with the balances well judged:  the piano is not unduly prominent, but is well integrated into the fabric of the orchestra.  You are unaware there is an audience until the well-deserved spontaneous ovation erupts at the end.  A lovely performance.  If it never achieves, for example, quite the heroic liftoff of the famous Cliburn/Kondrashin 1958 live performance in Carnegie Hall, it has compensating beauties of its own (including better sound).  Those who view this concerto as a vehicle for fire-breathing virtuoso display are advised to look elsewhere.   <br /> <br />The CD is filled out (total timing 61:02) with six short Rachmaninoff pieces, studio recordings (made in Berlin in Jan. 2000).  These pieces are pleasant without being of any great substance.  I found Volodos's own transcription of an andante movement from a cello/piano sonata the most attractive of the lot.   Again, Volodos's singing tone and warmly affectionate playing emphasize lyricism more than fire (and again, he sometimes plays with more pedal than I like).  Strongly recommended.   <br />
B0002858YS|5.0|This is one of the few albums I've purchased this year where I can honestly say I like all of the tracks on it.  In an age when most albums have only one or two good songs, this is a good thing.  I admit that what draws me to this album is that it mixes the music I listened to during my high school day of the late 80's (I graduated in 1990) and the \\"grundge\\" of my college years.  I reckon that this means that The Killers are not the most original band, and that the bulk of the music of that you hear on Indie 103 of Santa Monica, KCRW of Santa Monica, and KEXP of Seatle which is similar is not original; but, it is good and a big improvement over the standard A&R/Top 40/American Idol music of the past 8 or so years. <br />
0156027321|5.0|This is a difficult book to get into. However, once you get into the novel, Life of Pi becomes a book full of ideas and wonders you won't forget once it's over.<br /><br />Fairytales do the same. When you're little, and you are told a fairytale, it becomes too hard to avoid the magic of one, right? I guarantee by the end of this book, your mind will wonder back into its plot, wondering and remembering.<br /><br />Beautiful book. The character Pi teachers so many beautiful ideas to the reader, and remains human in the process. Richard Parker, the tiger, was an enjoyable character who I was fond of. This book may drag for some, but it has treasures for all! My only warning is how graphic some details may be concerning the animals. Very realistic, however.<br /><br />Anyway, I definitely wish every body would read this book!! Gorgeous in all aspects, and even with some flaws, it comes out as one of my favorite pieces written recently. A piece that illustrates how wonderful an outlet of creativity literature can be. A true book.
B0002F7I9Y|5.0|One wonders how long this great piece of music would have sat on ice had Ray Charles not passed away awhile ago. This is a truly great album which highlights his blues and country music roots. Each selection is a musical treasure. If you're into keyboards, you'll find great ones on this album. Not a dud to be found. Artists like Natalie Cole, Diana Krall et al are at their best. A must add to your musical collection.

The most under developed, piece of fake trash I have ever had to expierience \\"knowing\\" for the 100-odd pages this book exists for. I wish this book was never made because I hate seeing everybody think this is THE book! The one book to end all books, eh? NO, it isn't. Just because you never read doesn't make it the greatest book.<br /><br />This book force feeds us subcultures. I have nothing wrong with the existence of subcultures - unless, of course, they're being feigned through a straw into the mouths of hundreds of identity-less adolescent bodies.<br /><br />Everything in this book has no merit. I know everybody for a while feels this book is about them, and captures the heart of being a teen - feellng \\"infinite\\" - whatever, but enduring the tests of time, this book will never be remembered as anything more than a fad that may or may not be mentioned on VH1's \\"I love _____\\".<br /><br />I wish people would read real books. Books that convey emotion, thought, and PLOT. One day, Mr. or Mrs. TeenAngst, when you decide to put down The Bell Jar and read a book that doesn't fulfill your need to fill an empty space that was never really empty, you'll find there is more to books (and, well, LIFE) than reading about a book that you try to dictate your teenage years off of.<br /><br />One other thing: for the people who believe this is a \\"modern day Catcher in the Rye\\"...I don't remember Holden Caufield being a 15-16 old boy who writes letters to some stranger about his sex, school, and crap social life. I also don't recall this book being symbolic of ANYTHING (besides solid proof of how silly everything these kinds of characters stand for!)<br /><br />Please be warned: do not read this book lest you find yourself puking up emo glasses and calling every special moment \\"infinite\\".mo glasses and calling every special moment \\"infinite\\".
B00003CXCT|2.0|Could have satisfied everyone by including the original, untouched movie for the old timers, and the special edition for everyone else. The Alien Quadrilogy has both versions for each of those films. <br /> <br />I think a lot of people (literally thousands) will be downloading pirated versions of these films just so they can get the original version. That's a lot of lost DVD sales. The set could have had both, but inexplicably didn't. <br /> <br />I feel sorta disappointed. After all, these were my favorite all-time movies.
0679411585|4.0|Being an enthusiastic reader, I couldn't wait to get this book in my hands.  Having read some of the reviews here, I did have doubts about it's quality but after reading the book, I will say that if you are like some who were evidently looking for a flowery novel with perfectly written prose and a plot sewn together with the precision of Gone With The Wind, you will most likely be overwhelmed in the beginning. It is not an easy read but a good one if you take your time.  If you're a reader who doesn't want to think, avoid this one.  You won't be able to get through it. <br /> <br />Don't be frustrated by the author's obvious (and admirable) desire to give names to the faces of those heroic soldiers wrote about.  It is not necessary for you to even remember the names to enjoy the book though it will enhance your sense of \\"being there\\" and the emotions derived from knowing the real people behind the tale . <br /> <br />This was written to one end and one end only in my opinion-to let you know what it was really like to have fought in that unnecessary war. It does not, however, rely on the gore usually found in novels about combat (especially the Vietnam War) but more on drawing you into the chaos and intense pressure these brave soldiers were subjected to while fighting in this new kind of warfare.  Descriptions of violence are there but are not the grotesque Hollywood type usually found in books on this subject. <br /> <br />Having been a fan of military books and movies since childhood, I can say without qualm that this is the finest I have ever read (three times already in only 5 weeks)and would recommend it to anyone who desires to know the truth of this awful conflit and gain first hand knowledge of the what and why that caused it to occur.  I could not and did not set this story down until I finished!
0345423496|2.0|I figure if you're a Clarke reader you come to his work tolerant of his short-comings as a writer: weak characterization and weak dialogue. You come to Clarke for his speculative ideas and interesting plots. 3001 begins well enough; the ideas are abundant and the plot builds, albeit, a bit slowly. There is a bit too much of revived Discovery astronaut Frank Poole's recovery time devoted to the minutiae of fourth millennia technology. When Poole finally gets back into space and pursues the continuing mystery of the monoliths the book really gets rolling. Unfortunately, and inexplicably, Clarke rushes the conclusion, and I believe undercuts the powerful image of the Monolith he has challenged our imaginations with from the beginning of the Odyssey series. The supposed conclusion to the series leaves readers more confused than ever and trivializes one of the most potent images in sci-fi lit. Very disappointing and unsatisfying. I wish he hadn't even made the attempt.

B000002J1S|5.0|This album is a real miracle! In the year 1974 Peter Gabriel's wife was a hard pregnant because their daughter was born prematurely and Peter failed attempt at a filmscript. Other Genesis members didn't like that Gabriel's family was more important than his band members. Genesis would had been failed to make their last masterpiece with Gabriel but luckily they found their best sounds ever.<br /><br />The Lamb Lies Down On The Broadway is one of the best consept albums ever made. Pink Floyd's The Wall has sold lot of more but in my opinion The Lamb is more complicated, lyrically better and it has better more great songs.<br /><br />Rael from Puerto Rico is the main character and this album tells his strange, interesting, emotional and extraordinary adventure on the New York City. Gabriel has wrote a really weird story that has many deeper dimensions. It is not easy to always to find what he means(especially if you are finnish whose first language is not english) Anyway, Gabriel has succeeded to create a terrific story and imaginary creations that has its own places in the story. I wish that someone would colloborate with Gabriel and they will make together The Lamb Lies Down On The Broadway- The Film(maybe I should write e-mail to Gabriel and he might think about it)<br /><br /> Story and music walks hand in hand through to this album. Instrumental tracks are waiting, shifting, thinking and so on sections. Hairless Heart and The Waiting Room are my favourites if them. The first one a beautiful and emotional ballad, the last one physicedelic and paranoid song. Carpet Crawlers, Anyway, Lilywhite Lilith, The Chamber of 32 Rooms and Riding The Scree are also songs which I specially like.<br /><br /> You can listen to this album by picking your favourites but in that way you miss a lot. The Lamb is album that should listen to through out several times before you find its luxury. It's not to easy find The Lamb's extraordinary world if you are not friend of progressive rock music. This could be first really irritating and hard listening album but you should not give up if you don't like this at after first, second, third or fifht listening times.

B000000OQF|4.0|I'll tell you the truth if it wasn't for Slash then Guns N' Roses would never have gotten so big. I hate Axl's voice, its very high pitched and its nothing compared to Robert Plant's, Freddie Mercury's or James Hetfield's. Duff is a great bassist and definately one of the most underrated of all time. I also thought that Izzy was pretty good at the guitar but he showed off way too much and he really never lived up to Slash's greatness. Slash IS a top ten guitarist, although he was never nearly as good as guitar gods like Jimi Hendrix, Eddy Van Halen or Jimmy Page he still had some awesome solos and great riffs. The best song on the album is easily 'Sweet Child o' Mine' mainly because of Slash and also Axl's voice doesn't sound as annoying as it usually does. 'Welcome to the Jungle' is another great track and is probably Axl's best song since he actually tries to sound more like an actual guy rather than a girl. Steve Adler is an good drummer, but dont expect him to be anywhere near as great of a drummer as Neil Peart. There is some filler in here but overall its a good album for any eighties rocker.
B00005BF9Z|5.0|If you like Latin music, rock, alternative, sampling, rap, or world music, Manu Chao will appeal to you.

B00004Y6O9|5.0|In 1970 a very unfortunate turn of events occured, Jimi Hendrix, the ultimate guitar god had overdosed on drugs and choked on his own vomit, thus ending the life of one of the most talented and respected guitar players of all time. It was a sad time indeed but then at that time two new bands hit the mainstream. <br />  Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath. These bands, with their amazing vocalists and guitar players were destined to become huge. While Robert Plant was probably the greatest hard rock singer of all time he and Zep would never have gotten so big without the help of the immensely talented Jimmy Page. Ozzy Osbourne also helped push heavy metal into stratospheric heights with his dark, evil lyrics and low voice but without the work of Tony Iommi a lot of people would never have noticed Sabbath. But then in 1977, Ozzy left Black Sabbath, thus ending their mainstream success (they continued but they were never remotely as good as when Ozzy was there.) Also Led Zeppelins albums were beginning to slip and by '78 the quartet had lost most of their audience. <br />  Enter Van Halen, with lead vocalist David Lee Roth, lead guitarist Eddie (Eddy) Van Halen, bassist Michael Anthony and drummer Alex Van Halen the band would soon hit it big. As so many people have stated before me, Eddie Van Halen was easilly the biggest talent in the whole band. My stepdad had been telling me how amazing Eddie was so I purchased the album as I was a beginner guitarist at the time. The opening riff to the first track is a lot like Jimi Hendrix's 'Purple Haze', at least we know Eddie respected the guitar god in some way. The solo is intensely talented, assuming the fact that you know Eddie wasn't even trying. Following this song you enter the greatest solo ever 'Eruption', I couldn't believe what I heard when I listened to this, it was like Jesus had possessed Eddie and did the guitar playing (remember that Jesus can do whatever the hell he wants), I have been able to play Eruption all theway through, but the 1.75 minute song took me twice to three times as long to complete. From there you enter a cover of the Kinks 'You really got me now' and Eddie's guitar intro yet again catches your attention to take all the way through it. Then we hit 'Aint talkin bout love'.... The guitar intro moves you into it but when Roth starts singing you dont really want to go through the rest of it, but the guitar solo more than makes up for that. After this the album starts to sound the same, kind of (except for Jamies cryin' which is an intensely awesome song) until you get to 'Ice Cream Man'. Roth says that its for the ladies but as a straight guy I still find that its a great song to listen to time and time again with Eddies guitar. All this is wrapped up with another great song titled 'On Fire', this song is a perfect ending to one of the greatest rock guitar albums of all time.
0156027321|5.0|This is a tale of survival and faith that is a must-read. The book starts with a slightly tedious account of Pi's growing up in India but becomes more interesting as it goes along. It stands out for its clarity of presentation and a simple and straightforward story. If you stopped reading after the first few pages, then you definitely missed something good. The goings on are from a young teenager's point of view and any observations are correspondingly sophisticated. But if I were 16 years old and I did what Pi did, I would be very proud indeed! The end is quite unexpected and got me thinking for quite a while.
B000002KHH|5.0|There were bands long before Sabbaths time making contributions to heavy metal, like Led Zeppelin, Jimi Hendrix, The Rolling Stones, The Who and The Kinks. But after Black Sabbaths debut album things slowly but surely started to change. After Led Zeppelin had layed the foundation for HEAVY metal Black Sabbath decided to build where Zep left off, which offered some entirely new twists and experiments never heard or seen before. Black Sabbath truly looked and sounded like they were from hell, with Ozzy as Satan the band quickly help gave way to the heavy metal generation and ended the glory days of those damn hippees. After their self titled debut they wanted to make something more classic but still remain heavy, and they did... <br />  Enter 'Paranoid'. This was Sabbaths entrance into the mainstream with such classics as 'Paranoid', 'War Pigs', 'Hand of Doom', 'Fairies wear boots' and especially 'Iron Man'. Tony Iommi proves he is a great guitarist here, he may be no Jimi Hendrix but he sure knows how to make great riffs and catchy solos. Ozzys lyrical and vocal status are top knotch here and you know as well as I do that he IS one of the great gods of metal. Geezer Butler is a very fast and heavy bassist, in songs like the title track you can never keep up with him (unless your name starts with a C and ends with -liff Burton, but unfortunately he's dead). Bill Ward was also a great drummer and was very underrated, he deserves A LOT more than what he got. The only not-so-good song on here is 'Rat Salad', it just didn't do it for me and like many other Sabbath fans said it was definately a dive from previous work. Buy this album you Metalhead! Buy the album that started all the evil!
B00007BK2N|4.0|If you have anything in common with the Sex Pistils and early punk, the comedian Steve Coogan, Monty Python, Joy Division, Happy Mondays or how Digital Video can suit a subject matter on film, then 24 hour party people will be a welcome rainy night nostalgic pleasure with more than enough giggles and *smut-lite* to keep you ticking over for most of its long 119 minutes. Told documentary style we follow the times and trials of Granada Television reporter/host turned night-time new-wave gig and record producer, Tony Wilson, when Manchester was at its peak in rock. Although very specialized in its subject matter, making it certainly hard to watch by many, it is a sort hybrid cross between Spinal Tap, Monty Python's Holy Grail and Steve Coogan's brand of television humour. It is not Trainspotting by a long shot, and although it does drag on at times without any clear focus, it is still a very interesting film to watch with many memorable moments. Anyway basically how much you like this film depends on how much you have in common with the above. If none of that interests you then you will probably find it a drag.<br /><br />I would hold off on getting this one if you have not seen Spinal Tap. Spinal Tap is much better, but if you like Tap then you will probably like this one also.<br /><br />Basically Tap fans should look no further than this offering if they are looking for a quick fix of something along the same vein. Yeah the humour is sort of like that BRITISH STYLEE!!!<br /><br />And of course it has an A+ soundtrack for a 4 star movie.

Don't know what the TV people were thinking when they pulled it...They must not have actually watched the show.  It is one of the most original and entertaining Sci-Fi shows I have seen in a long, long time.  Sometimes it is more than just about believablity...Sometimes it is just about entertainment...And this certainly has that.

B0001L3MI0|5.0|I am surprised by the large number of negative reviews this movie has received.  Yes, the plot is implausible - e.g. no one would believe that a virus could be generated and uploaded from a laptop computer to the aliens' mothership so easily.  And yes, the characters could be developed a lot more.  If one focuses on these two aspects, then this flick is a failure.  But these shortcomings are more than made up for by the comical side of the movie.  A lot of humor is embedded in not only what the characters say but also in the acting, the photography, and the plot.  Some of the visual effects are pretty cool as well, but the humor is what makes me watch this movie over and over again.    BTW, it's ironic that the World Trade Center towers survived the aliens' attack better than they did on 9/11.....

I do not like \\"Up\\" but rest of the albums are good.<br /><br />Songs in this album are quite rocking with the usual jingle-jangle feel of early years.The best song has to be \\"I believe\\" which introduces the listeners to a whirlwind of sounds.

The film has an intensity about it that it is able to sustain all the way through with very few slow moments. For those who enjoy James Bond type action flicks this is a can't miss selection.

Forty plus years later I still dream about him and it's still very emotional to see him at reunions.  We just had our 40th reunion. I still cry after seeing him. Re: My So Called Life: I love the whole story line; it takes me back some yet I now realize that it's still the same in many ways for many young people.  I really feel for young people today for I think life is really rough for a lot of you. Please love and respect yourselves and others.  Let's all be on the same team.  It's so difficult for 2 people to get along sometimes no wonder there's war.  I pray for this to change. God Bless. <br />
B00000I8UK|5.0|Dolphy's innovative music has held up over time and sounds as fresh and innovative today as it did when new. I guess that's part of the definiton of a classic recording. This one is challenging to listen to and draws the listener in with it's unique rhthyms and unusual instumentation. One of the best free jazz recordings on a par with those of Ornette Coleman and Coltrane. If that style floats your boat don't skip this one.
B00004BZ0N|5.0|Well, I guess there are times when an album doesn't quite live up to its hype. \\"London Calling\\" considered the best punk album made, was either #7 or #8 on Rolling Stone's 500 greatest albums list, and gets constant praise from everybody. So I thought, Man, I gotta get this album. I heard their first album (UK version) and it was brilliant by all means. Even with its simple song structures, the lyrics were defiant and powerful. And I expected more with \\"London Calling.\\" <br /> <br />Upon first listen, I was a bit disappointed. It just sounded... weird to me. It didn't quite sound like punk at all. And to me, it didn't even seem to fall in a single category. It's not quite punk, not quite rock, not quite reggae, not quite ska... but as I thought about that, I kept thinking of the Beatles' \\"Sgt. Pepper...\\" album. Experimenting made the Beatles better than ever. The Clash experimented here as well. It's not just a guitar, bass, and drums... it's the band with, literally, an orchestra behind them. The incorporation of reggae and other musical styles made the Clash more grand than ever before and made them sound bigger than just about every other band out there at the time. <br /> <br />As I listened more, I began to appreciate this album for the sound it had. It's unique and cannot be matched by any other band... ever again. And it's great were not hearing the same ol' stuff again. The addition of brass instruments and others made the music stand out more and sound much more powerful, bringing out the best in the lyrics. The Clash took a small departure from their roots but they emerged as a better band, more powerful, and they've improved drastically music wise. <br /> <br />Experimenting is a risk, but the Clash succeeded, much like how the Beatles and the Meat Puppets have. A masterpiece by all means. The songs are excellent and there's so many to choose from. <br /> <br />But does it really live up to its hype? Well, I'm still unsure of it being considered as the greatest punk album ever, but it's certainly one of rock's greatest albums. As for best Clash album? Well... for me, it varies between this album and their debut album (UK version). It may take a while to grow on you (like what happened with me) but in the end, you realize how great of an album this is.
B00005JNEI|1.0|I have a headache, please pass me the advil!     Michael Moore is the sleaziest of the sleazy, and shame on him for telling so many lies! How ironic that Michael Moore blames Bush for telling lies, when he (Michael) tells more lies than anyone can possibly count. That's okay though, because on November 2nd the silent majority will speak and George W will be back in the White House for four more years!   :)     Go ahead Michael Moore, and spew your hate. You have the right to speak your mind, and we the American public have the right to disregard your nonsense. I know that you have done everything in your power to sway voters with your garbage, but the only voice that matters is the vote on November 2nd.      Come on people, Michael Moore is a fat, college dropout that has nothing better to do with his life but to tell lies and spit out hate. Even Senator John McCain said that Moore is a \\"disingenuous film maker.\\" Can't you see that!? Michael Moore   is such a gross and nauseating man! He is already a millionaire and he IS NOT a regular guy like you! All that he wants is to further his agenda. Don't fall for it and by all means don't put more money in his pocket!    I have nothing else to say. Michael Moore isn't worth using my brain cells.
B0002IU988|4.0|So this is what happens when Mark Tremonti solo's! I was wondering if he even could after Pity for a Dime. This is a much revitalized group of musicians along with a singer that actually knows how to use his range.  <br /> <br />Although Stapp's vocals worked incredibly well with Tremonti's powerfull guitars, something seemed missing to me. I don't know if it was Stapp's baritone that was holding Tremonti, but compared to Creed's work this stuff is heavier. It's also great to see Brian Marshall back with his pounding bass, a great talent nearly thrown away be ego and pressure.  <br /> <br />There are also fantastic lyrics on this album without so much of the pathos of SOME of Creed's previous work. Open Your Eyes and Broken Wings are the standouts to me but that could change as I listen to it more.

The title for <br />the album is appropriate since it was recorded during  <br />the height of the bloody tension between Catholics and <br />Protestants in Ireland and Northern Ireland. The tone <br />of the album is fairly political in nature, and conveys <br />a sense of anger and sadness over the politics not only <br />in Ireland and the UK, but all around the world, and  <br />the violence that is the byproduct of it. There is a <br />bit of a spiritual tone to the album as well on the <br />final two songs. It is arguably one of the most  <br />important albums U2 has made, not only from a musical <br />sense, but from a political sense also. All in all, this <br />is a good way to lead into their fourth studio album, <br />The Unforgettable Fire. It's a worthy addition to your <br />album collection.
B000099T2L|5.0|1. Crazy In Love (9/10)- Its the first single off of the album. At 1st i wasnt feelin it, but when homegirl did that booty dance i was like WHOA!

B00004XONN|5.0|2000's \\"Kid A\\" is Radiohead's brilliant and chilling vision of the future.  The melodies, structures, arrangements, lyrics and singing found throughout the album are all unique and amazing. That much we all understand...However, There seems to be a story being told here. As we all know, a theme Radiohead love to depict is the Loss of humanity at the hands of our quickly progressing technologically obsessed world.  With this album, all of those themes come to afore.    <br />    In fact, after having listened to it countless times, I have gathered an opinion on the actually concept \\"story\\" of Kid A.  Tom Yorke himself has said that \\"Kid A\\" is the story of the first human clone.  With this knowledge and with the flow of the album so well put together, I feel a coherent story has been told here.  Track by Track I will attempt to describe the story Radiohead seems to be going for... <br /> <br />1. Everything in it's Right Place - This song, with the futuristic sound and themes it attempts to get across, seems to be depicting the moments before this first human clone has been created.  When Yorke sings the phrase \\"Everything, in it's right plaaaace\\", one gets the idea that things are not at all in their right place.  Something sinister is going on here. It ends with the sound of an alien ship landing, perhaps signifying the birth of this \\"new\\" being. <br /> <br />2. Kid A - the title track starts with infant toy box sound effects, and Thom Yorke \\"sings\\" the song through some sort of effect rendering \\"the baby's\\" voice.  The whole song has a sort of new and innocent feel that contributes to the sense that this \\"kid A\\" clone has just been created. <br /> <br />3. The National Anthem - WOW.  The brutal anthem of the nation, world, or whatever, this song is Radiohead's idea of the song of the world in the age of cloning.  And frankly, it's scary.  Kid A, the new clone baby, has been thrusted into the reality of the new world and it is terrifying.  Neverending skyscrapers, oil fields, and greedy, dehumanizing corporations come to mind.  This is just not a place humanity can survive in.  After the intense swirling of horns and dissonant-as-hell chords ending the song, we hear Kid A scream a weary call of anguish as he simply cannot handle the awful reality of the world.  His desperate call fades into... <br /> <br />4.  How to Dissapear Completely - with this song, Kid A, so dissolusioned with the world he is brought into, strives to dissapear from the dehumanizing circumstances of reality.  He claims he is \\"not here....this isn't happening\\".  Whether it is meditation or just a total loss of self due to the uncaring, brutal reality...He is lost. <br /> <br />5.  Treefingers - as it turns out, he seems to have found peace of mind from his efforts in \\"dissapearing\\", and this lyric-less, almost chordless soundscape perfectly represents his state of utter tranquility and transcendence. <br /> <br />6.  Optimistic - Returning from this peace of mind in an entirely new state of mind, he has a sense of optimism about his life, for the first time in fact.  Singing, \\"You can try the best you can, you can try the best you can...the best you can is good enough\\".  Kid A seems able to cope with the world for the first time.  But.... <br /> <br />7.  In Limbo - this newfound possitivity doesn't last.  No, indeed, Kid A finds himself in a whirlwind of uncertainty in this brutal world.  He is undecided what to do and where he stands. \\"In Limbo\\" is the perfect title for the track, as the music, beat, and lyrics are all awash in a swirl of haze and never quite seem to go together...yet radiohead makes it work. <br /> <br />8.  Idioteque - WOW again.  AMAZING.  Set to an awesome dance beat with 4 sad, super-metroid sounding chords providing the backdrop, the song is brilliant.  What is going on here, you ask?  Eh, it's only the end of the world.  \\"Ice age comin', ice age comin...women and children first and the children first...\\"  Thom sings these lines with such convincing panic that it really feels like the world, or his chances of being a real human in the dissolusioned world, are coming to an end.  In the end, the hysteria overwhelms poor Kid A.  Leading us to... <br /> <br />9. Morning Bell - A song filled with lines like \\"You can keep the furniture\\" and \\"where'd ya park the car\\" one gets the sense that this song is about relationships and the trivial things that engulfe people's lives these days.  But then, the mantra \\"Release Meeee, Release Meeee\\" comes in and it's clear.  Kid A is begging for a release from this world.  He sees no value in becoming a slave worker of the masses, the brainwashed consumer, or part of the status quo middle class.  Longing for the peace of mind he felt earlier, as shown in \\"Treefingers\\", Kid A forgoes the valueless existence so many settle for in the scary world he observes and begs to be \\"released\\"... <br /> <br />10. Motion Picture Soundtrack - Singing over a funereal organ melody, Yorke, or \\"kid a\\", is granted his wish of release.  His death seems to come as a relief to him, and with his final call of, \\"I will see yooou...In the next liiiiife\\", it is evident that Kid A's life in this world has come to an end.  One can only hope his \\"next life\\" is FAR different from the one he went through here. <br /> <br />    Kid A is Radiohead's Sgt. Pepper.  Like it's predessor, it is experimental, intriguing, and a representation of the times and feelings of the time it was released... <br />    However, as we all know, the 21st century looks to be a pretty bleak time, with wars, famine, disease, industrialization, technological progress, and money hungry corporations setting the stage...Lord knows what's coming next.  One can only hope the concept of cloning ceases before things get out of hand.  The ability to truly render the gene code of a human being and implant into an egg is frighteningly near.  And once it happens, we will all realize that this has gone far enough. <br /> <br/>    Wow, it'd have been nice to have been born hundreds of years ago, before America was turned into a \\"booming\\" metropolis of asphault, grey looming skyscrapers, billboards, corrupt politics, greed, and advertising. <br /> <br />Of course, that's why one day I will move to the hills of California with a family and get away from all the hubbub of middle class droning, thereby finding some place \\"real\\" and untouched by the aimless blade of science and consumerism.   <br /> <br />NOTE:  For a less bleak vision of the world, listen to those idealistic lads the Beatles.  Amazing albums include \\"Rubber Soul\\", \\"Revolver\\", \\"Sgt. Pepper\\", \\"The White Album\\", and \\"Abbey Road\\"...Oh hell, just buy em all.
B00005JLXE|4.0|Daredevil fans all have their favorite rendition of the Daredevil character and their favorite issues of the comic. I'm a Daredevil fan who appreciates the entire run of Daredevil comics since the early Stan Lee and Jack Kirby days. Daredevil has had his ups and downs but I've loved 95% of the issues of the comic that I've read. As a fan of various forms of fiction I always like it when newer versions of a story go back to their roots. I also like the way a story or character changes over the years and I want to be introduced to new revelations about my favorite character. Daredevil the movie does all of these things.     The movie Daredevil brings back some of the light fun of the original Daredevil comics when comics were often comic, vibrant, and far out. Director Johnson is clearly a Daredevil fan and I think he worked the names of every artist and writer who ever worked on the Daredevil comics into this movie! The film moves fairly quickly from Matt going blind and discovering his heightened senses to Matt training himself and that's a point of controversy for some. Not for me. That's just the way Stan Lee told that part of the story in the original Daredevil issue that spawned the comic series in the first place. This doesn't mean that there aren't new twists or other versions of the origin of Daredevil also used in the film. The film's origin tale derives from various issues of the comic and even parallels the origin given when Daredevil appeared on the animated Spiderman series.    I was impressed with the way the film mixes in classic Daredevil with later takes on the character. There's far more character development and angst in the movie than there ever was in the original Daredevil comics. This will be a plus or a minus depending on which Daredevil is your cup of tea. Some have complained that the character's flaws are a weakness and they like their super heroes \\"super\\" like in the old days. Others wanted less classic comic booky action and more character development. I thought the film did a fine job of showing all the diverse interpretations of the character which have kept me hooked over the years.    Johnson knows and loves Daredevil and it shows. His movie includes not only the original version of the character but the edgy tone of later Daredevil comics and various characters and storylines from Daredevil's 40 year run. You get the fun and funny side of the character as well as the angst and anger. The film also reveals a Daredevil so angry with criminals beyond the reach of the law who prey on the innocent that he takes matters into his own hands and punishes them himself. Daredevil then struggles to keep his rage and hunger for justice from making him the very thing he hates. These moments make him something different from the usual comic book movie super hero and I was shocked and impressed. That's a pretty ballsy move for a comic book movie.     I wasn't impressed by a lot of the CGI in the film. From his DVD commentary it seems the director didn't like a lot of the CGI scenes I didn't care for either. Many of the scenes Johnson filmed for this movie sound like winners but they ended up on the cutting room floor due to decisions made from his higher ups. I'm extremely eager for the release of the director's cut. It's also clear from the commentary that Johnson worked hard to bring Darededevil to life. I admire that. The commentary and DVD extras are very well done and I'm very happy to have this DVD in my video library but not all Daredevil fans will like this movie.     There are fans that dislike the character development of this movie because they wanted more classic comic book styled moments and \\"super\\" stuff. Others want more character development and dislike the \\"campy\\" and classic comic book elements and \\"super\\" action. Some will want to see their favorite issues brought to life and not other aspects of the character's 40 year run. There will also be those who like the film. I suspect that those who have enjoyed the entire run of the comic might enjoy it the most. I also think those who don't read Daredevil comics at all might enjoy it since they wont be expecting just their favorite issues of the comic.

0452273331|5.0|I knew that halfway through reading The Fountainhead that it was either one of the best novels or the worst novel ever written. Precisely those reasons why some people would despise it, would be the fuel for other's praise. I found that by the end, however, I had an entirely different viewpoint on why I felt as I did.     The Fountainhead is simple and extremely well written. It is about an unconventional architect and those who attempt to bring him down, even those who love him. It is about the philosophy of individualism and socialism.     There are basically five main characters in the story:     Howard Roark: The author's \\"vision\\" of the perfect man, a \\"hero\\". He has little concern for others and prides his own individualism and creativity above all else. Feels no suffering, shows little emotion.     Dominique Francon: Basically the female version of Roark but stranger. Finds pleasure in pain. Always takes the irrational road. First raped by Roark, then falls in love with him.     Peter Keating: The man who has it all--at first. Everything but a sense of who he really is, and has to get all his satisfaction based on what others think he is.     Gail Waynand: Ruthless newspaper tycoon who resembles Roark in a way, but one main difference separates them. He has a love for power, and he needs others to make him what he is, unlike Roark.     Ellsworth Tooley: Socialistic hypocrite who has power as his underlying motive, and yet treats others with more kindness than anyone else in the story. The opposite of and individualistic person.     I prefer to write this review for those of you who will hate or do hate this novel, and those of you who love this novel or will.     I hated the characters. They seemed out of place. They seemed to unusual for the world we live in. People like that don't really exist.   I loved the characters, they are some of the most complex, ingenious people ever put to paper. Their ideas fit perfectly in this surreal world Rand has created.The Fountainhead has no hero. Even what Rand perceives as the hero, Roark, is not really one at all. He has no compassion for anyone but himself. How can he possibly be admired?   True, there may be no hero, and that is what makes it brilliant. For many Roark will be the hero, but I think the majority will say there is no clear cut villain or hero in this story, and it blasts the traditional mode of storytelling and creates something breathing with originality and energy.     The Fountainhead is too preachy. Are we really supposed to believe all that nonsense and lengthly speeches? Rand's main point of individualism is just full of flaws, lack of compassion, and what feels to be an attack on those who actually help others.   The Fountainhead is full of precious gems you can abstract out of the ideas you don't even agree with. Whether you like it or not, Rand has some of the most ingenious comments on socialism and egoism ever written.     The Fountainhead doesn't leave you feeling good inside. It   is cold all the way through.   The Fountainhead leaves you feeling a sense of awe and   overwhelming. You would have to read it many times to really soak it all in.     The ending is too conventional. A shocking ending   might have been more appropriate.   The ending is anything but conventional. Look closer   and analyze it, you will see.     The Fountainhead took too long to explain everything. It was a simple story that could have been told in a lot less time.   The Fountainhead went by too quickly. Rand could have written thousands of pages and it never would have bored.     The philosophy in The Fountainhead is preposterous. Rand has a bigger ego than any writer out there if she really believes all the crap she writes down.   The philosophy in The Fountainhead awakens us to emotions we rarely feel in stories nowadays, and whether you agree or not, at least you can say it made you think a great deal about it.     I could go on and on with the reasons why you could love this book, or why you could hate this book. I believe the people that focus too much on whether they love it or hate it don't step back and see the sheer beauty of it all. I personally don't feel there is any hero in The Fountainhead; different characters could be different heroes to different readers, but I didn't have one. I don't even agree with much of the philosophy the author presents and believes herself. What the author thinks is meaningless in this case. I don't feel whether you love or hate this book should be based on its philosophy and what you personally think of the ideas presented here. Some books can be evaluated solely on its philosophy and on its characters, but its rare to have a book that can be   evaluated on a much grander scale.     The Fountainhead's absolute perfection lies in the fact that it can make people love or hate it. It's perfection lies in the fact that it cannot be taken in at once. The perfection lies that it can be so many different things to so many different people. Its perfection lies in the fact that it is controversial, that it awakens others opinions and emotions.     There could be millions of different opinions about The Fountainhead The fact that it has the power to do all these things precisely what makes it one of the most remarkable achievements of all time in literature.    Grade: A
B0000CAXIC|5.0|This album is slightly nirvana influenced, sometimes dark, often emotional alt rock. Despite this it stays near the middle of the road nd therefore is still vey easy to get into. Dave Grohl has lots of emotion in his voice like other lead singers (johnny rhzenik and the guy from eveclear) due to a slight edge or roughness to his singing which makes these songs better than all those 'epic' pop ballads.       Foo Fighters first album together as a band is much more commercial than In Utero and this has led to Foo Fighters bcoming Popular with many fans with different music tastes.       Just on one Album Foo fighters show a lot of variety. Hey Johnny Park wouldnt look out of place on Nevermind whereas 'See You' could have been done by the Bay City Rollers. Thats why i like this Album because the right song for your mood is only a track switch away. Of course it goes without saying, all the songs are great.
0316666343|1.0|I agree with \\"Where's Whoopi\\" and \\"What a let down\\" completely.  Combined, they express my sentiments exactly.  This book is going everywhere and nowhere simultaneously.  It is extremely contrived and lacks any entertainment value.  The ending was lame.  It was as if the author just needed to hurry up and finish the book and couldn't quite figure out how to wrap things up.  Overall, it was an utter disappointment, specifically considering all of the hype surrounding this book.
B000002KO3|5.0|What makes this record so good? Byrne's voice floats along the polyrhythmic, seemingly endless soundscape, spouting lyrics with Lennon/McCartney cleverness. Equal measures of psychedelia, disco-dance-ability, noisy guitars, and gospel-type chorus. I'm at a loss to better explain its natural hook. All I know is when I was a bummed-out teenager this was the music to make me shake my a s s.   <br /> <br />When this record came out my nerdy sister gave it to me as a gift. I think I ignored it for a quite some time. A few years later a bunch of us saw the Talking Heads live in a tiny hockey arena in Lowell, Mass. And that was it. My little gang of friends and me gradually took up Remain in Light as our soundtrack. <br /> <br />I revisited Talking Heads '77, Fear of Music and More Songs About Buildings and Food. What a fabulous set of transitions the band made in that few years of their greatness.  <br /> <br />The T-Heads were an excellent gateway drug that helped me move on to more powerful concoctions by Jazz artists, Classical composers, Bluegrass bands, and all kinds of so-called alternative or college music.  <br /> <br />Remain in Light is strong evidence that there is always more room for exploration in music.
B00001MXXH|5.0|If you're browsing for Ferris Bueller's Day Off, it must mean that you don't yet own this movie.  For many people, this is THE high school movie.  There have been a lot of positive reviews for the film, so I wanted to just add that this is the kind of film you cna relate to.  Even the very intense scene involving the expensive car and the neglected teen is something that everyone can relate to on some level or another.  I can definitely say that for that moment alone, the sheer intensity of the drama in the middle of a hilarious and very real film makes Ferris Bueller's Day off far more touching and truthful than many films.  This is one to own.
1400034779|5.0|I tired of gory, death-on-the-doorstep-everyday mysteries years ago, so was very happy to find this lovely series.  Gently and mindfully written, the stories are funny and endearing, the mysteries gripping.  Different, refreshing, and a nice view of another way of life. I've also listened to this book on tape and it's read by just the right person!  <br /> <br />To enjoy them even more, order some roibos (redbush tea:fruity, non-caffeinated and healthy) to drink while you read them, and share both with friends!
B000089RVX|5.0|There's no doubt about it, Evanescence has given us a great album!  Personally, I still think they have alot to prove though!  By that, I mean, I hope they stick with their current sound, and even make it greater!  If you like Evanescence, then check out the Finnish band named, Nightwish!  Nightwish has several albums out, so they've proven themselves!  I recommend starting out with Century Child from Nightwish to get a great idea of what they're capable of.  Do yourself a favor and go check out Nightwish, and buy Century Child...and thank me later!

B000002L7J|4.0|As another reviewer said, the Smiths are an acquired taste, but once you acquire it it never quite leaves you.  I'm much older (and fatter) than when I first met Moz and Marr but they still occupy a big place in my heart.  I think their depth and versatility stand them head and shoulders above their contemporaries like REM, U2 and the Lemonheads.    Meat is Murder is a great record.  It is less overproduced than the first release (\\"less overproduced\\" is the best one can hope for from a Smiths album), and band actually sounds like the rock outfit it is, as opposed to the britpop band it was portrayed as on the first release.  We even see glimses of the self parody Morissey engages in on Strangeaways Here We Come in songs like \\"What She Said\\".    Rushholme Ruffians is maybe my favorite Smiths song period and there are only two songs here that I would say are bad.  \\"I Want the One I Can't Have\\" is a mishmash of cute lines Morrissey seems to have jotted down in his notebook and thrown together in a song to fill out the first half of the album.  And then there is the much maligned title track.  I actually think  the song is musically strong and sets a great creepy kind of mood.  But this mood collapses before it even begins, when frenzied mooing breaks through the intro.  Moz comes across like a 14 year old who has just read a PETA pamphlet and tells us the smell of turkey roasting in the oven is the unholy stench of murder.  I just can't help collapsing into giggles whenever I hear this track or think about it.    All silliness aside this is a masterpiece and essential for any Smiths or 80's post-new wave fan.  Buy it or get a crack on the head!
B000286S8S|4.0|In similar fashion of The Whos: Ultimate Collection and The Rolling Stones: 40 Licks, Warner Bros brings us a 2-disc Van Halen hits collection. Unlike the formentioned collections, not much is held back,the track list speaks for itsef. This is the real \\"Best of\\" we've been waiting for. As usual everything has been remastered (again) some for better some for the worst. The highlight of the remastering work can be heard on the OU812 tracks: Finish What You Started, Black & Blue and Feels So Good. Finish What You Started sounds like a different take (and countrary to what others have stated, it has not been cut short- it is in fact longer! The original fades a few seconds before the rough cut ending). The low point of this collection is the new material. It needed a bit more polishing, the new songs sound forced and the band sounds tired. The three live tracks at the end (all featuring Sammy Hagar singing David Lee Roth era songs) should have been cut in favor of Without You and Fire In The Hole so that the Gary Cherone era could have at least been paid some respect.
B0002NRRAG|5.0|I think that I am very blessed to have become familiar with Madeleine Peyroux's music at first hand during the time she spent in Nashville. Seeing her work in the romantic, dimly lit, \\"Blues Hideaway,\\" sitting beside the actor Mongo, as she sang, was almost like stepping into a motion picture and an impressive and compelling one.Her delivery is so seemingly effortless. Her pronunciation so clear and the word nuances so well united with her use of facial expression ,that marvelous as a recording of hers is , seeing her in person is really necessary for a full appreciation of her art.I hope very much that a video will be spawned by the album so that her wider audience will have the joy of seeing all of this. As usual her choices of material are eclectic , Bob Dylan, Billie Holiday, Bessie Smith,Leonard Cohen, Her own ,well crafted \\"Don't wait too long\\". Madeleine, in her own quiet, unassuming way is as much bigger than life as any of her heroes. She is often compared to \\"Lady Day' but in actuality she uses the styles and word usages of Holiday and Piaf and others as a painter uses rich colors for the exact desired effect. She might as easily be compared to Vermeer. And succeeds in the same , highly finished way, that he did with his art. Bravo, Madeleine! And world,  \\"Don't wait too long \\" to buy this album. Masterpieces increase in value.  J. Geoffrey Jones
6305426651|4.0|With this opening line, Roberto Benigni, Director, lead character, and writer (with Vincenzo Cerami) of this film, establishes its symbolic, rather than realistic, emphasis.  Set in 1930s Italy, the film opens as a slapstick comedy, with the rubber-faced Benigni (who won the Academy Award as Best Actor for this role) playing Guido Orifice, a hyperactive clown, as he repeatedly surprises a beautiful young woman, acts as the clever hotel waiter, and attempts to exchange hats with men he meets.<br /><br />Despite the frantic comedy, however, the fascist dictatorship and the growing anti-semitism loom constantly in the background, as Guido's uncle (Giustino Durano) is assaulted, his horse is painted green, and a local school principal talks about getting rid of defectives.  After a lovely segue to represent the passage of six years or so, we again see Guido, now married to his beautiful Dora (Nicoletta Braschi), and meet Giosue Orifice, his son, winningly played by six-year-old Giorgio Cantorini.  Totally committed to protecting his son from the horrors of anti-semitism, Giorgio turns everything into a joke.<br /><br />When the family is eventually rounded up and shipped to a concentration camp, Guido turns the event into a \\"birthday surprise\\" for Giosue and tries to ensure his survival by pretending that all the events are part of a huge game, with the winner getting a full-sized tank. Disappearances from the camp are explained as people dropping out of the game.<br /><br />In some ways, Guido's game-playing sets the reality of the concentration camps into sharp relief, intensifying the horror by showing the lengths to which a father will go to protect the innocence of his child.  The viewer knows that the game is a pitiful, and ultimately hopeless, attempt to hold back the reality of the Final Solution but cannot help hoping that against all odds, somehow Guido and Giosue will win.  The horrors of the Holocaust are obvious here, and the ironies of seeing both Guido and his captors all playing some sort of macabre \\"game\\" will not be lost on the viewer.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed Benigni's pratfalls, his touching attention to his family, the music (by Nicola Piovani, which also won an Academy Award), and the cleverness of the plot.  But I also found that my realistic knowledge of the Holocaust was so overwhelming I could not \\"suspend [my] disbelief,\\" and I was unable to appreciate the film as the wonder-filled \\"fable\\" Benigni intended.  Mary Whippleaying some sort of macabre \\"game\\" will not be lost on the viewer.

B000069HKH|2.0|I bought this album soon after it came out, and liked it at first. But, after listening to it for awhile, I started to like it less and less. IMO, not a good album by Springsteen. The best tracks on this are The Rising, Mary's Place, and Lonesome Day, and those songs are not that great. Quite a few of the songs are dreary, dull filler.  <br /> <br />If you're just getting into Springsteen's music, I recommend Born in the USA, Darkness on the Edge of Town or Born to Run. I wouldn't buy this album.
B00003CXCT|3.0|You all know the story, so I won't review that here.<br /><br />You all know about the changes, and they're not too bad. There are only 3 irritating changes, and 2 of them last only a few seconds. The Jabba scene is the only long change, and you can just skip that chapter with your remote.<br /><br />For the most part, the DVD transfer of these films went extremely well. The video looks crisp and clean. The CGI is beautiful. Honestly, I must agree that this is the way these films should be made. I AM upset that Lucas isn't releasing the OT, but if he did, I'd probably watch this version more often than the other. It's beautiful.<br /><br />That said, there are some serious quality issues here!!!<br /><br />1) When the Millenium Falcon is leaving the Death Star in Episode IV, the graphics on the TIE Fighters are messed up: There are grey bounding boxes around the fighters as they fly through space in some of the scenes. It goes by too fast for most of it, but when you notice it, it is very jarring.<br /><br />2) The audio for speaking parts is absolutely horrid in some places. Voices change from being muffled to tinny to muffled all within one scene. This happens the most on A New Hope. It is very irritating and jarring. For the most part, it damages the movie watching experience a great deal.<br /><br />3) Lightsabers. While most of the lightsaber scenes look better with the new graphics, several look horrible. The saber colors are muted, or they appear colorless, etc. Very sad considering that this was supposed to be a major selling point of this release.<br /><br />Overall, I am pleased, but I would not pay full price for this when the price goes up. It is ok at the sale rate you can get it for now, after the release.
B00005O438|3.0|Big dog chases bunny. Bunny runs into hole. Big dog sticks nose in hole. Bat bites big dogs big nose. Horror results. CUJO is the tale of a poor St. Bernard who contracts rabies, causing him to kill and kill again. Dee Wallace Stone (The Howling, The Hills Have Eyes) is menaced, along with her son. They are trapped in their car by the huge, slobbering beast! Watch Cujo hurl himself at the car! See him covered in bloody foam and dirt! Sort of a hairy, land-locked version of JAWS. While the first 2/3 of the film are slow-going, the finale' is worth the wait! Not for the squeemish pet owner! No real Cujos were harmed during the making of this movie...

B00005JLXE|1.0|Please note that this review is for the original theatrical release (which is, in fact, what this (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition) DVD is. If you want the director's cut, you need to go to the entry which says, \\"Director's Cut\\"). I have not seen the director's cut, because I'm not sure if I can stomach more of the same movie, and I doubt that the cut could possibly fix the biggest glaring flaw in the theatrical release.  <br />  <br />What's wrong with this movie, you ask? Well, let me start with a summary of just who Matt Murdock is in the comics:  <br />  <br />MATT AND THE LAW:  <br />Matt Murdock is a highly intelligent defense and civil attorney, who truly believes in the law.  <br />  <br />As Matt Murdock, he largely defends people who are down and out. And, with few exceptions, he will even defend guilty people. This is because, more than putting criminals away, he needs to believe in the system.  <br />  <br />As Daredevil, he always operates just on the right side of the law (unless one counts assault and battery, of course). He's a highly skilled martial artist (more on this later) - which is a good thing, since this means that he doesn't need to kill his opponents in order to win. Which is good, because refuses to kill. EVER. He doesn't believe he has the right to decide who lives or dies. He beats people up, sure. Sometimes (especially lately) he will even seriously maim people. But, no matter how much pain he's in, no matter how much grief and anger he's going through, he always stops short of killing, because he believes it's wrong. Always. Even when it comes to Bullseye.  <br />  <br />Just to reiterate: Daredevil. Does. Not. Kill. EVER. No matter how much he may want to. If it seems like I'm harping on that fact, it's because I am. Aside from his tremendous compassion for strangers, the biggest thing that makes DD a *hero*, is his tremendous sense of justice and fair play, his willingness to hold himself accountable for his actions (even if he sometimes has to compromise ethically, he has to be dragged into it kicking and screaming), and his recognition that, no matter how much it hurts, he does not have the right to play judge, jury, and executioner. And I am absolutely APPALLED that the moviemakers did not recognize this.  <br />  <br />If DD were to encounter a rapist who got off scott-free (which, incidentally, is a case he would never prosecute as Matt Murdock, since he is not a prosecutor, and even if he did, he would never give a closing argument so lame and devoid of logic), he would keep an eye (or an ear, as the case may be) on the guy, and wait for him to break the law again, and then pounce, and present the evidence to the authorities. He would NOT chase the rapist onto some subway tracks and then stand by and jeer while the guy gets run over by a train!!! GAAH! He didn't even do that in the comic when it was Bullseye on the tracks, and he had good reason to truly *hate* Bullseye! In one scene, the moviemakers managed to take every single thing that makes DD a hero, and turn it upside-down.  <br />  <br />And I will never forgive them for that.  <br />  <br />MATT AND HIS BLINDNESS, SENSES, AND MARTIAL ARTS SKILLS:  <br />In the comics, Matt was hit in the face with a canister of radioactive waste, and woke up in the hospital blind, with all of New York screaming in his ears. This, actually, was well portrayed in the movie - for all of about 20 seconds (before he miraculously learned how to interpret and use an essentially completely alien set of senses).  <br />  <br />In the comics, this was somewhat more realistically handled - Matt was terrified for weeks, before a rather abusive blind sensei by the name of Stick basically whacked him over the face and told him to grow up. Then he basically put Matt through months (or years, the comic isn't very clear on this) of boot camp, constantly pushing an eager-to-please Matt to higher skill levels. Matt EARNED those martial arts and acrobatic skills in thecomic. They weren't just miraculously given to him.  <br />  <br />MATT AND DARKNESS:  <br />As far as I know, in addition to losing his father and finding his body after he'd been shot point-blank in the face (and keep in mind that blind people recognize their loved ones by touching their faces)...  <br />  <br />Matt has lost at least 4 girlfriends (to death, as opposed to the countless girlfriends he lost because they left him or turned out to be psychotic killers). Two of them he loved with all his heart, and they were both slaughtered by Bullseye, right in front of him. Also, recently he's been placed in jail and forced to stand by, helplessly, and listen while Foggy got stabbed (apparently to death). Every time something like this happens, Matt goes through a dark, depressed period (which gets darker each time), where he withdraws from his friends and becomes overtly hostile to the people who want to help him. Each time, his actions become progressively more self destructive... and sometimes, downright bizarre, as he struggles to make sense of the chaos and pain inside his head.  <br />  <br />...and yet, at the same time, he also becomes somehow *more* self-sacrificing, *more* compassionate to the strangers he helps, *more* determined to spare everybody else the pain that he's been through, and *more* heroic, with each new trauma. And then, through sheer force of will, he works his way through it, always keeping his actions on the right side of the law, and struggling to forgive the idiots who make his life a living hell.  <br />  <br />-----  <br />  <br />In other words, Matt Murdock, as portrayed in the comics, is a true hero, even though he's dark. A person who proves that even if you have darkness inside of you, you can, if not overcome it completely, at least keep it pushed down. He is a person who is worthy of tremendous respect... the kind of respect that many fans reserve for Captain America.  <br />  <br />In contrast, Matt Murdock, as portrayed inthe movie, deserves no respect whatsoever. He's a sadistic playboy who feels no accountability for his own actions. He is the exact opposite of the real, deep, tortured, generous, compassionate, intelligent, ethical champion of true justice that's portrayed in the comics.  <br />  <br />And that is why I hated the movie. Dislike is far too mild a word. I HATED this movie.  <br />  <br />Aside from the complete character asassination of one of the greatest heroes out there, there were a couple of other issues, many of which I imagine were fixed in the Director's Cut:  <br />  <br /> - The CGI which ignores little things like the laws of inertia and gravity (in real life, if you take a running leap, the leap will carry you forward. Not 15 feet straight up).  <br />  <br /> - The absolutely moronic playground fight, conducted in front of kids, out of costume, apparently because the fighters *liked* each other?  <br />  <br />I've said it before, and I'll say it again... I wish so badly that the moviemakers had just used Frank Millar's \\"The Man Without Fear\\" as a script. That story was the perfect origin story to Daredevil, with *intelligent* action and solid (and true) characterization. I would have really enjoyed seeing that movie. Instead of struggling to get through it without throwing something heavy at my TV.
B000000OAC|5.0|News of the World, in my opinion, is Queen's second best album, just behind The Game. Of course, you have We Will Rock You and We are the Champions headlining this album. Other good songs on this album include Spread Your Wings, Sheer Heart Attack and It's Late.
067101756X|5.0|We waited 50 long years and finally, somebody who values the TRUTH has spoken out and tells it the way it was in Roswell, New Mexico, on the night of July 4th, 1947 --- IT CAME OUT OF THE SKY!  Possibly downed by the super-high voltage lightning storms of NM, this alien mother ship crashed and changed our quality of living when humans scavenged thier technology by reverse engineering of it's technology into our modern high tech gadgets.<br /><br />Lieutenant colonel Philip J. Corso, (R) a distinguished member of Pres Eisenhowe'rs National Security Council and former head of the Foreign Technology Desk at the US Army's Research & Development Deptpartment, has come forward to tell the world what really happened in Roswell so many moons ago.<br /><br />He was a hard -working soldier, who had a high code of honor and valor.  He is a believer in the truth, and through the Freedom of INformation Act, he decided to publish his spin on the story.<br /><br />It is a startling story, but told in a way that smacks of the truth.  The Gov stashed the truth from an inquiring public, because they didn't want the nation to spin in fright about non-friendly aliens who had hositle intentions against us.<br /><br />For example, cow mutilations, human abductions with subsequent probing type experimentation, UFO Power beams that knocked out power and endangered human space flight in the 60's.<br /><br />All this sounds too fantastic to be true, but the author tells it like it was just another day on the job.<br /><br />One question he does not answer, however, is WHY DID THE ALIENS SUDDENLY GO AWAY?  Why are we dismantling our massive nuclear arsenal today if we still feel a threat from the little green people?  Actually, Col. Corso does not feel these alien beings are actual living organisms, but rather, they are a genetically altered humanoid automatron; which are the result of cloning of humans from our very own Earth! They are some freakish hybred being that is comprised of cloned human parts, and a stem cell here and tucked there. It's not really fully explained what he thinks the dead aliens are...they were a life form however, and when they crash-landed in Roswell, they 'died.'  But they had no way to eat or obtain sustenance, or eliminate bodily wastes.  The spaceship itself had no engine, no navigation system, no fuel, no control system and no propulsion that was obvious to any scientist who studied it.  It remains one of the biggest technological mysteries --- even today.  The technology of the alien spacecraft is still very advanced compared to all the inventions we gleaned from the crash vehicle.  It is housed in a secret bedroom at Norton Airforce Base in California, but you and I will never get to peek at it!<br /><br />So, it gathers dust.<br /><br />The author claims that Astronaut Neil Armstrong had reported seein an alien base on the moon during the Apollo 11 flyover and landing....of course, NASA won't admit to it because it's being treated as a matter of national security.  No wonder Armstrong has never published his book on his lunar landing....or maybe it's (secretly) written already and is waiting on a shelf at his home and upon his death, it will be released to the world - the real facts of what he witnessed on the moon.<br /><br />That's what military folks do...the live, they keep horrid secrets and then they see the end of their lives around the corners and they publish their life story.<br /><br />Nobody can persecute a dead man, after all...<br /><br />Other pilots and astronauts also made similar claims of seeing UFOs in their trainging or military flights, but no one responded to their claims.<br /><br />THe sad reality is that anyone making such outlandish claims is immediately labled a nutcase - or they are accused of having a mental breakdown.  We are we so eager to discount reality?  I think it's far more dangerous to deny what thousands of UFO witnesses have sworn testimony to.  Aliens are out there.<br /><br />The last portion of this book deals with two famous geniouses, THomas Edison and Nikola Tesla, who created many world shaking inventions such as electricity and televsion and radio.<br /><br />Corso also reveals how he seeded modern industries with the basis of revolutionary inventions gleaned from the Roswell crash that eventually led to discoveries like<br /><br />integrated circuit chips<br /><br />fiber optics<br /><br />lasers<br /><br />super tenacity fibers<br /><br />and eventually computers.<br /><br />One day we will have to come to terms with the absolute truth about aliens and our planet, and the planet they hail from.  It may be a time of extreme worry and fear.  But we have reached milestones with inventions and we can continue to conquer any threat that comes to our attentions.  Finally, we can join together as one world and defend our right to live free.<br /><br />Thank you, Colonel Corso, for writing a risky book that some call a fraud but most dare to believe.<br /><br />There is no reason whatsoever for this man to embellish, there is nothing to gain by telling fairy tales.<br /><br />SO - based on this&#62; &#62; &#62;  choose to believe.omas Edison and Nikola Tesla, who created many world shaking inventions such as electricity and televsion and radio.   <br />Corso also reveals how he seeded modern industries with the basis of revolutionary inventions gleaned from the Roswell crash that eventually led to discoveries like <br />integrated circuit chips <br />fiber optics <br />lasers <br />super tenacity fibers  <br />and eventually computers. <br />One day we will have to come to terms with the absolute truth about aliens and our planet, and the planet they hail from.

B00003CXCT|1.0|I just found out these are the \\"improved\\" versions of the trilogy.  I was so excited to buy these and now I will not.  I too belive George Lucas is wither extremely selfish or extremely smart.  I think it may be the ladder.  I think he will get everyone to buy this junk then later on release the REAL versions of these movies so everyone will have to buy them again.
B00005JM20|4.0|It seems to be filled with nasty Hollywood inside jokes that are never shared with the public. A scene with a take on Hitchcock's Cary Grant disrupting a private funeral service seems strangely real. Another, with our man English demanding a secret message  written on someones's body be revealed, is hilarious in a psychotic sort of way. Often it is only typical of the spy spoof genre but when it is funny, it is very funny.
B0000AQS0F|4.0|It seems as though some of the negative reviewers were set out not to like the show.  VIZ: <br /> <br />Someone talked about the planets being terraformed 'by magic.'  Not magic--technology; so what if the ins and outs of the technology weren't explained? <br /> <br />Some others said that the mixture of English and Chinese was 'ridiculous.'  How so when the the two most powerful countries on Earth are the United States and China?  Hence, when Humanity left Earth-that-Was, is it not logical that English and Mandarin would be the two dominant languages? <br /> <br />The idea of having some colonies being almost pre-industrial while others were as 'futuristic' as any in science fiction was a refreshing departure from the sf convention of everything being squeaky-clean.  The juxtaposition of the two is a perfect metaphor for modern society, where in the most wealthy country on earth we have people who don't even have indoor plumbing. <br /> <br />I will agree that the characters weren't as well-developed as they might have been, nor were certain questions fully answered (like what, exactly, was the Blue Sun Corporation up to, and what was it that was so bad about the Alliance government?) but it is hardly the writer's or director's fault that the show was cancelled before they got around to that.  I'm sure that there are unused scripts gathering dust in desk drawers which would fill out these issues, and that the upcoming movie will do so. <br /> <br />The most interesting and enigmatic character is the Shepherd Book. I agree with the writer who said that he was given little to do.  I suspect that in a former life he had been a high official in the Alliance, and that during the War he had done something horrible, something for which he could not forgive himself; after spending some time in the Abbey, it was laid on him as a penance that he find a group of die-hard Independantists who had suffered from the war and to minister to them <br /> <br />JW wanted to be the 'anti Trek.'  Where on Trek the universe was so full of sentient life that you almost couldn't turn over a rock without finding it, in this show humankindis alone. Where on Trek we were shown a ship that was the apogee of technology and a crew who represented the best and the brightest of the culture, here we are presented with a barely-spaceworthy bucket of bolts crewed with assorted riff-raff.  Gene Roddenberry, bless his idealistic, romantic, humanist heart, was sure that by the time we reached space we would have overcome all the baser parts of our nature; here, however, we see a universe populated by the same horny, greedy, selfish S.O.B.s that we meet every day--and the same noble and generous ones, too (and sometimes they're the same people!) <br /> <br />I never saw \\"Firefly\\" when it was on the air; I was introduced to it by a bit of fanfic by someone who had written stories I liked in another fandom.  Having seen the DVDs, I am sorry I missed them.
B0002S947K|5.0|First and foremost this is a relaxed, sexy album. Possibly the best make-out album released since the mid to late 70s. There will inevitable comparison's of Lamontagne's style to Van Morrison. This is not a bad thing. Personally I would say he's nice cross of Morrison, Otis Redding, and Bob Dylan, with some contemporary 21st century notes as well. As a bottom line, his voice is highly emotive and a perfect foil for the somewhat minimal and honest production on the record.  <br /> <br />The album is consistently excellent, and never monotonous. Its still growing on me, but I feell Lamontagne has more staying power than Jack Johnson, or any singer songwriter of this generation except Elliott Smith (RIP).  <br /> <br />Get on this album early, it is guaranteed to be smashing success. Hopefully Lamontagne will have a long career. These songs are such a joy to experience.
B00005JGAB|5.0|After hearing of the death of another Ramone, Johnny falling to cancer this time, I decided to write a review of the very first true punk album.  The album that launched a thousand punk bands.  Some good, most stunk.  Even good new bands like the Riverdales, who obviously are updated Ramones, can't touch the Ramones.  There's not a lot that can be said about this debut album that hasn't been said.  It's short, fast (for it's time), and to the point.  It is the album that epitomized what the Ramones were about.  1:30- 2:00 songs.  No Solos.  Topics that 1976 youth could identify with:  Sniffing glue, trying to get chicks, random violence...being bored.  The songs and lyrics were unintentionally, (or maybe intentionally..who really knows with the Ramones) funny.  Titles like Beat on the Brat, I Don't Wanna Go Down to the Basement, Now I Wanna Sniff Some Glue, I Don't Wanna Walk Around with You.  Bottom line though, the songs were all infectious.  No one had heard 60's rock n' roll performed with a snear like this before.   No one ever had a guitar that sounded like Johnny.  No one ever had a voice like Joey.  No one ever played drums in the time that Tommy did.  And, no one started every song by yelling \\"1-2-3-4!\\" or wrote the type of lyrics like Dee Dee did.   <br /> <br />This album is 5 -stars, but not as high on my scale as the brilliant Road to Ruin and almost as good Rocket to Russia.  It gets 5 stars alone for it's impact and importance in rock history.  Without it, you never would have had the Clash, the Sex Pistols, X, or any other punk band.  It really is a perfect album.  It suits the average person's attention span perfectly, with fourteen songs coming in at less than a half hour. The tunes are just great and guaranteed to have your neighbour pounding on the walls of your apartment.  And the album cover is one of the best in rock history- all four Ramones in their leather jackets, ripped jeans and running shoes, looking partly bored and partly tough.  Little Tommy standing on his toes so as to not look quite as short next to the lanky Joey. <br /> <br />Thanks for the document bruddas!
B00006879E|1.0|.....with another chick in a video, I'm going to smash my TV!!! How full of himself is this clown? <br /> <br />Anyway, on to the music.  Why?  Are these people actually moved by this tripe?  Do they actually like making this mass appeal/market rubbish, or do they just see dollar signs?   A hybrid of Justin Timberlake, Matchbox 20, and Jamoruquai (sp), 2 out of 3 who totally stink.  This music leaves you feeling empty and hollow.  No substance behind any of it, made to produce hits and income and not feelings.  Thumbs down.
B00005JMJ4|2.0|I have little doubt this film depicts what it was like to be an American overseas during 9/11. Although it is never mentioned there seems to be no other reason for the constant inability to leave a Tokyo hotel, spend endless hours watching the tv, allow the camera to repeatedly capture the sight of Tokyo skyscrapers. It so conveys the feeling of being stuck somewhere that I felt increasing impatience and a bit of anxiety watching it. As it started, I was laughing with abandon at Bill Murray's culture clash with the Japaneese, but this initial amusement soon became restless as the culture of Japan is never seen as anything but a stereotype. Scarlett Johansson is sweet but dull as Murray's interest and Murray's character is soon diminished to a meaningless person as the director steers us into what must be her expression of 9/11. Thanks but no thanks. I have my own impressions.

0385512104|4.0|I give Mark Haddon full marks for the innovative idea of getting inside the head of an autistic youngster and placing this incredibly analytical but emotionally insulated teenager in a highly emotive environment and then letting the fireworks fly.  Well, with that formula the author couldn't go wrong particularly as our hero (and he is all of that) experiences sensory input at an extraordinary level without the ability to filter out the devastating amount of detail. As a consequently he needs exacting but compulsive order in his life to keep his demons at bay.<br /><br />This novel which I couldn't put down choked me up on several occasion but then again I like other readers, I imagine, am easily moved by heavily handicapped individuals surviving in an incredible hostile environment.  Yes, that comment was meant to be somewhat cynical to underline the point that the writer could hardly put a foot wrong with his novel even if he tried.  but I still give him full marks (100).<br /><br />I don't know if it was due to the fact that as a native English speaker I read this book in Hebrew, but I found the child's adversary's behavior a little askew from time to time and not altogether believable.  I don't want to give anything away for those who have yet to read this book, but would a kind, thoughtful individual really descend to the level of violence that this particular character does in killing the dog?  I hardly think so. And then would this sensitive family who obviously adored their child be so very dysfunctional in their behavior to one another and to the child? Maybe... I'm not sure but due to these doubts I give the book 4 and not 5 stars.<br /><br />This book seems to have conquered Israeli sentiments, where child care culture reaches exaggerated proportions at times, as nearly everyone I meet is either in the throes of reading it, has read the book or intends to do so and all have much to say about its emotional content.  Well done Mr. Haddon and thank you.. <br />
B0000D96NW|5.0|I've been a huge Machine Head fan since 97 but I do have a confession to make. I wasn't even looking forward to this album. Roadrunner let them go and you would figure its because they weren't writing powerful songs. Supercharger didn't sound very inspiring and the band did say they were going back to their wall of sound. I thought it was BS at first because bands like Megadeth and Metallica were claiming the same stuff with their last albums but it was a lie. <br /> <br />But I'm going to admit this: I WAS WRONG! The new album does bring back the almighty walls of guitar without even rehashing their old stuff. The first song I heard off the album was Imperium and I couldn't believe what I was hearing. It was the return of Machine F'n Head! This new album definitely should've been the follow up to The More Things Change. I did like The Burning Red but you know what I mean. <br /> <br />There are a lot of great songs on here. My favorite cuts are Imperium, Left Unfinished, In the presence of my enemies, seasons wither, and descent the shades of night. Descent is definitely their best slow song ever... it blows away Deafening Silence and The Burning Red. I'm so proud of Machine Head in writing out a great metal album. I don't think they would've gone in this direction had they not hired Phil Demmell... I think he might've been a good inspiration on Robb. Ahrue Luster is a terrible guitarist, I'm so glad he's gone. I even yelled \\"machine head owns you!\\" when ill nino opened up for Anthrax.
B00003CXCT|2.0|I don't really like star wars that much.It has tons of action wich is cool but they are kind of weird and I don't like the charecters that much.The 1st movie is 4 stars out of 5 The secon and 3rd were probally both 2 or 3 stars.
B00003CXCT|1.0|First of all I'd like to say I am a big fan of the Star Wars Trilogy.  I think it is great fun to watch these movies, but sadly, I dont want to anymore.  When the \\"special editions\\" of these movies came out in the late 90's, I was very excited.  After seeing \\"The Empire Strikes Back,\\" was very disapointed.  The CGI looked terrible! It was so out of place from the 70's special effects.  Keep in mind, I have grown up in this wasteland of tasteless movies featuring crappy CGI.  Bottom line, if you like these special editions, be happy with a piece of trash.  For those UNCOUNTABLE MASSES that aren't, Boycott it with me!
B0002MPU1K|5.0|TERRIFIC! I wish there were more cd's like this one. Melody, swing, funk and unbelievable piano chops. The arrangements are top notch and his songwriting keeps getting better. This guy has it all.
B00003CXCT|5.0|I have just received and watched the DVD trilogy back-to-back. I grew up with Star Wars (was 11 when the first one came out) and must admit that nostalgia is a powerful thing. It is great to have all 3 films in one handy package ... but if Lucas is not going to rerelease the films in their original versions, then you had better hang on to your old laserdiscs and VHS tapes and I don't mean the Special Editions! <br /> <br />That said however, the DVDs are an improvement, if only slightly, over the Special Editions. My two biggest qualms with them have been rectified, one fully and the other partially. The former was Luke's scream as he jumped and fell in Cloud City - they have removed it entirely. The inclusion of the scream (it didn't even sound like him) in the Special Edition took away Luke's integrity ... remember, jumping was his own choice. Second was the controversial Greedo shooting Han first scene in the Cantina. This time, Han and Greedo trade shots almost simultaneously which is a compromise of sorts.  <br /> <br />What does this all mean? Together with some other minor changes, it looks like Lucas does listen to the fans. Remember what happened to Jar-Jar in AOTC? His role was drastically reduced. However, do not get your hopes too high for the release of the trilogy in its original form. For all you know, even if Lucas were to accede to our requests, the original masters may have completely deteriorated. So, probably what we would now want is the trilogy in its original narrative form but with spruced up audio and visuals ... food for thought! Did everyone also realise that The Phantom Menace DVD is not the original movie version? There are additional minor scenes in that one ... so hang on to your Japanese Laserdisc if you have it! <br /> <br />I have no complaints with regards to the audio and visual quality of the DVDs, they are close to perfect. The most controversial addition must be the replacement of Sebastian Shaw with Hayden's Force Spirit at the end of ROTJ. Before we go ahead to slam Lucas, I am confident that it is the result of a major plot point in Revenge of the Sith ... and will be explained fully (if you think hard enough or participated in the forums such as the one on TheForce.Net, you would be able to realise why). <br /> <br />Well, I have bought the DVDs, watched them and have no regrets, even knowing that I may have to buy them all over again, especially if they came out on High Definition. Staunch Supporter or Foolish Fan? You decide.
B00005JNEI|1.0|The fact is the media is telling us that everyone is loving it.All the Liberal people who did not see it gave it 5 stars and the Conservatives gave it 1 star.Most of the stuff in this film was not trueful like the whole thing with Iraquis having a barbecue until we started bombing them.I think Mike can do alot better then this junk.Show us some real facts not what you and Dan Rather made up.Bush did his milatary duty over 6 years of experience in 5 and a half years. That is a surplus of milatary and the only reason Kerry was in the swift boats is because when he started going in they were shipped over to Vietnam.You can give me all the negative reviews you want but the fact is <br />George W. Bush will probally win President and John Kerry will probally go politically insane just like Gore and Dean.
0393035158|5.0|It could not be more clear that we live in frightening times. For the first time in history, the world and more specifically The West has become the object of a hatred more terrible than ever imagined by civilized people.  Many millions of people whose world view would be more appropriate in a dark time many hundreds of years ago have made it their stated goal to anhilate all persons who are not of their particular faith. The terrifying part is that they have at their disposal, weapons of sufficient power and sophistication to lay waste to much of the planet and its inhabitants. The reaction to all of this in the west has been a retreat into opposing fundamentalist doctrines which threaten to revert us all to the caves. Sam Harris is among the first in recent years to hold up the mirror we all need to gaze into. We live in a society which, although labeled free, is hardly free of ignorance and tribal politics. The nationalism which has been the source of so much tragedy and strife in history has been dwarfed by a sort of religious nationalism which has laid the groundwork for a war of civiliztions which, even now, threatens to be the source of unthinkable slaughter. And it is not only Muslim extremism but Christian and indeed Jewish fundamentalism which is the poison so many have taken as their elixir. Sam Harris is a brave man to speak so forthrightly to the issues of our day and to make it clear that our antiquated religious doctrines will be, rather than a source of wisdom and comfort,  the assurance of a self-imosed armageddon. Unless the world can embrace the notion of  our common humanity and build our ethics upon our needs in this world, the only world which exists, we will be doomed to extiction. \\"The End of Faith\\" is a very important book which should be required reading for all thinking people. It should replace The Gideon Bible in hotel rooms. It should be a first step in a dialogue which will decide just what the future of our race will be. I congratulate Sam Harris on his wisdom, his fine prose and his courage in speaking what is more often than not, unspoken, even by people who believe it needs to be said.
B00003CXCT|5.0|People need to get over it.  These movies belong to George Lucas, the OWNER of the movies.  Not us.  As any artist has a right to change their work, so does he.  These changes are not just for the sake of changes, but to get the movies to what his original vision was.  And that was just not possible with the technology at the time they were filmed.  Personally, I like almost all the changes, but am glad Luke's scream is gone and the Han/Greedo scene is cleaned up better.  I like having Jabba in Star Wars, I like the updated Wampa in Empire, the updated Cloud City, etc etc.  Plus add to the fact of the picture being cleaned up, sound jacked up, and good ol' Disc 4, I'm as giddy as a schoolboy.<br /><br />Will I buy this set?  YES!  People that don't want this version  but instead the originals, can buy the original videotapes out there.  I for one will regulate those to my collectables and watch these from now on.  All you nay sayers need to lighten up and just enjoy the movies.
B00003CXCT|2.0|Despite denials from creator George Lucas, Fox plans to release the unaltered theatrical version of the original Star Wars trilogy on DVD September 12.<br /><br />In spite of strong statements from creator George Lucas that 2004's digitally remastered, restored, and enhanced versions of his original Star Wars triology were the definitive versions of his films, Fox and Lucasfilm have announced they will release new two-disc DVD sets that will include the original versions of Star Wars,The Empire Strikes Back, and Return of the Jedi as they were originally shown in theaters when released in 1977, 1980, and 1983, respectively, along with the remastered \\"definitive\\" version. The movies will be priced at $30 each and will go on sale September 12, 2006, and be available only until December 31, 2006.<br /><br />\\"Over the years, a truly countless number of fans have told us that they would love to see and own the original version that they remember experiencing in theaters,\\" said Jim Ward, President of LucasArts and Senior Vice President of Lucasfilm Ltd. \\"We returned to the Lucasfilm Archives to search exhaustively for source material that could be presented on DVD. This is something that we're very excited to be able to give to fans in response to their continuing enthusiasm for Star Wars.\\"<br /><br />The video quality of the original theatrical versions will not be as high as 2004's remastered versions, and Lucasfilm is reportedly adamant that Lucas has not changed his mind about which versions he considers authoritative. But re-releasing the theatrical version is a concession to fans, and-master of merchandizing that Lucas is-the films' creator seems to have found a way to satisfy those requests while keeping the Star Wars money train rolling.<br /><br />Star Wars fans of a certain generation will be happy to point out what they feel are significant differences between the films, aside from effects shots. In the words of one colleague, \\"C'mon. Han shot first! Really, all that needs to be said.\\"

B0002O06N0|5.0|I asked this question last night as I listened to \\"Rubber Factory\\" For the first time. The Black Keys use the framework of the blues without succumbing to its conventions. The result is the most vibrant rock and roll sound in the last 10 years. To me this album sounds like a mix of the soulful slightly more traditional blues of the first album and the dense heavy rock influence on the second album. They also throw in a few slow burning rock numbers in there. However the song that completely sold me on this record was \\"The Lengths\\". The Black Keys singing a ballad? What? I've got to tell you it's a great song and a testament to their versatility. Keep em comin boys, cause if \\"Rubber Factory\\" is a sign of things to come, then I can't wait to see what's next.
B0000DD7LB|2.0|I know that many people are just soooo in love with Britney Spears... but that is all that they should be in love with.  There is no way that people can possibly be in love with her music.   <br />I don't reccommend buying this CD unless you are planning on using it to put in during an aerobic/dance session.  This is not great music.  It is the same beat, the same rythem, and just what I expected from Britney.   <br />I personally do not think that Britney can sing.  She is a great performer and dancer, however, her voice is just not there.  In her earlier CD's her voice seemed a lot better.  Now it sounds like any average person's voice would be with a few vocal lessons and some high tech equipment.  <br />Britney uses her body and dance moves to reel her fans in because without it she would not sell a single album.  You do not see Jessica Simpson standing on stage and struting her stuff, all you see is her hitting those incredibly awesome notes and making the entire crowd go crazy.  Britney Spears lip sincs when she is on stage and just makes the boys drool and the girls wish that they looked like her.   <br />This CD is just the same old stuff... dance music... same beat and same voice.  Britney trys to throw in a few slow songs to actually pretend that she can sing and they sound alright on the album but when you hear her live you would want to leave.    <br />I heard this CD at a friends house and I would not reccommend buying it.  I am sure plenty of people will because they want to support Britney and try to dance like her and look like her... but have you ever heard someone say \\"I would love to sing like Britney Spears\\"?  no.
B0002MPU1K|5.0|This is one of the greatest CD's I've ever heard!!!!! I loved \\"Some Kind of Wonderful\\" and \\"On The Moon brought\\" me to tears. Peter's sings like he is talking directly to you. \\"St.Louis Blues\\" had me tapping my toes- i couldn't get enough of it's infectious beat. This cd is perfect for every occasion, lounging by the pool, romancing your lady or dancing the night away. Holy Toledo, hurry up and buy it!!
B0002IQHY8|3.0|You know what really really bugged me? Alan Parsons ventures into the world of electronics and guess what; NO CD-TEXT!!!  <br /> <br />Anyway, about the musical style, it was to be expected that opinions would differ. This kind of music exists for a long time already, but not in the mainstream market. Personally I found the post Woolfson cd's getting more and more predictable/ boring, so after listening to A Valid Path I have to admit it was 'refreshing'.  Not completely my kind of music though but it does make nice background music when playing C&C Generals.  <br /> <br />What I did enjoy to the fullest was the sound quality! Nice to know that in that area he is still improving. I can also dig those nice little effects with the voices :-)) Uhm, some lyrics were embarrasingly bad/ cliche... <br /> <br /> <br />I hope it won't take that many years for a follow-up and that I'll be more pleasantly surprised.

B0002MPU1K|5.0|I NEVER write reviews........however after reading Ms. Vincentelli's comments.....I felt that I had to voice my opinion. <br />ON THE MOON has not left my CD player since I got it ! <br />This young musician's work has moved me as few others have. <br />From his take on old favorites....such as I Love Paris and Bali Ha'i <br />to his wonderful original compositions like the title song and <br />the deeply touching He's Watching.....to my favorite, I'd Rather <br />Be With You....Peter Cincotti is not only a musician who is  <br />on top of his many talents, but a man who is in touch with his <br />feelings and not afraid to reach out and share them with the world through his beautiful, sensitive lyrics and unexpected <br />melodic turns of phrase.  I love the instruments that he has <br />chosen to respond to his instrumental and vocal lines.... <br />the harmonica and violin come to mind.  His choices are often <br />sweet and playful and after listening to this CD many times over <br />.....they still surprise my ear in a wonderful way.  As much as <br />I have always loved Up on the Roof......I have never heard the <br />lyrics interpreted as well as they are by this artist.  I REALLY <br />LIKE THIS CD and I plan on giving it as a gift this holiday <br />season.
0440539811|4.0|I'm writing this review several years after having read the book.  I still remember exactly the feeling I had after finishing it, \\"What just happened?\\" <br /> <br />Although there are some very funny moments in the book, I can't say I enjoyed reading it, but, ironically, I'm glad that I did and I'm considering reading it again.   <br /> <br />I'm giving it 4 stars because although it's not a favorite of mine, it has left a lasting impression on me (not sure what that impression is) and it has made me question some things that I used to take for granted. <br /> <br />I just recommended it to a friend who's starting to get caught up in some of the current popular conspiracy theories, because it gave me a sort of sixth sense about conspiracy theories. <br /> <br />I recommend the book to anyone who likes to think about things, i.e. stuff.   <br /> <br />It was a hard read for me. The only reason I finished the book is because I wanted to see if ANYTHING was actually going to happen. Immediately after finishing it I was confused because I didn't \\"get it\\" and angry because I felt like I'd just flushed several hours of my life down the toilet. Over time the book started to pay dividends though as I would see and hear things that would remind me of it or make me chuckle. <br /> <br />Definitely a strange read.
B000002JEV|5.0|The young fresh Led Zeppelin's BBC recordings where very good considering how early all of the member's where. This double disc includes many great songs by Led Zeppelin including great blues tunes like I Can't Quit You Baby, and Since I've Been Loving You. I cant get over how pure, and good the sound quality is on this complination its so great for being recorded so long ago. Thats what Led Zeppelin could do perform a live show better than their studio recordings, in this case its kind of both because they where in the studio BBC and they where playing live. The earliest session was recorded in 1969....the earlier tunes like Whole Lotta Love, What Is And What Should Never Be, and How Many Times are really good considering the bands young age. Their are many repeats on this complination including Whole Lotta Love, and Dazed And Confused. Their are also some latter Led Zeppelin songs including Stairway To Heaven, and Going To California. Their is a really cool Whole Lotta Love(Medley) including Boggie Chillun'/Fixin' To Die, That's Alright Mama/A Mess Of Blues. These recordings are great by all means please get this now!!!!!
B0002MPU1K|5.0|There's seems to be this new wave of young crooners out there and I have to say I haven't been into any of them... UNTIL NOW. <br />I saw a TV commercial on Peter just the other day and I went out and bought this CD. I haven't stopped playing it since I got it and I can't get \\"On The Moon\\" out of my head...  it's driving me crazy!!!!! I don't even know if I consider Peter Cincotti a \\"crooner\\", as much as I do just an amazing all around musician. I never post reviews, but I had to this time. I highly recommend this CD to pretty much anyone...
B000002UAX|5.0|\\"And just look what meditation did for Ringo--he's gone and written his first song.\\" -John Lennon    Coming back from their holiday in Rishikesh where they frolicked with the suspicious Maharishi, the Beatles settled into the studio--the loss of Brian Epstein still weighing heavy--and began their slow death as a quartet. Not a musical death, though, since they still manage to capture some of their greatest moments. With several rooms in the studio running at once, they were able to at various points engage themselves in solitary or group activity. George Martin famously said that they should've condensed the 2 LPs into one and it would've been even better, and I'm willing to agree, but only up to this point--the Beatles being the Beatles, their high points are so high, so much higher than that of any other popular group, that even songs that one would normally deem mediocre seem to take on a strange majesty simply by their proximity to the others. As it stands, many fans consider \\"The White Album\\" to be the group's best for the very reason that it's so messy, that they chose to hold nothing back. It laughs at the convention of one band with one album with one sound with one singer and an obedient band behind him. The Beatles on this album are many bands, basking in the spirit of endless invention that marked their later years (and that is absolutely nowhere to be found in today's music). The great variety of tunes they put forth seem to be fighting for dominance on the album, fighting to dictate tone and atmosphere. See how beautifully the opening notes of John's \\"Dear Prudence\\" wash away Paul's hard-driving \\"Back in the U.S.S.R.\\" \\"The White Album\\" sees John at his absolute peak with \\"Prudence,\\" \\"I'm So Tired,\\" and the sublime abstraction of \\"Happiness is a Warm Gun.\\" It sees Paul also at his most varied--the playfulness of \\"Rocky Racoon,\\" and the folksy melodies of \\"Blackbird,\\" \\"I Will,\\" and \\"Mother Nature's Son\\" that made John snicker. He also turns his insecurityinto rage (comical rage though it is) when he responds to Pete Townshend's boasts of decibal superiority with \\"Helter Skelter.\\" This is also the album where George really takes off as a songwriter and leader, lovingly handing the guitar duties to his pal Clapton on \\"While My Guitar...\\" and turning in two very great songs (\\"Savoy Truffle\\" and \\"Long, Long, Long\\") on the second LP. And for those looking for artsy trash, look no further than John's \\"Revolution 9,\\" as artsy and as trashy as they get, clearly made under the influence of the powerful drug Yoko.
B00003CXCT|3.0|Hey, I'll buy both the \\"Special Edition\\" and the \\"Original\\" if only you release both on DVD.  I already have the old originals and the special editions on tape but the original DVD's are what we really want!  I'd do it for you man.  I loved the special editions, but they weren't what I fell in love with. <br /> <br />I was born in 1977, so I suppose I will never have a chance to experience IV as it premiered on the big screen in 1977.  Oh well, It's unfortunante that I admire someones work so much that I'm willing to be taken advantage of.  I'm sure you will release the originals a year or so after the release of episode III for an extra pad from the franchise.  Truly, unfortunante that I know the truth. <br /> <br />But who cares!!  Just make the OG DVD's and make special editions of I & II.   *man I hope III is cool!?
B000002UAU|5.0|\\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\\" is without a doubt the best album in the history of mankind.  It starts off with \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\\" a sort of introduction to the album. Next is \\"With a Little Help From My Friends\\" Ringo's best song by far.  After is John Lennon's tribute to LSD, \\"Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds\\". The next two songs, \\"Getting Better\\" and \\"Fixing a Hole\\" are enjoyable, but the album takes a break from the fun fest after them with \\"She's Leaving Home\\" the story of a runaway girl which is slow and has lots of harmonizing.  Then the next song, \\"Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!\\" goes to the other extreme and is exuberant and joyful.  Then comes George Harrison's only song on the album, \\"Within You, Without You\\" which many people say is the weakest song on the CD.  It's not the best song, but it is totally different from any other of the songs and is to \\"Sgt. Pepper's\\" what \\"Love You To\\" is to \\"Revolver\\"- a song that proves the the Beatles could do Western and Eastern music and still make them both good.  The next song, \\"When I'm Sixty Four\\" could be part two to \\"Mr. Kite\\" if not for the lyrics.  After is \\"Lovely Rita\\" a ballad to a cop named Rita.   After is \\"Good Morning, Good Morning\\" which is yet another bright and joyful diddy.  Next is a reprise of the opening track, bidding the listener good night, and then the Beatles' masterpiece, \\"A Day in the Life\\" which is to the Fab Four what \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" is to Led Zeppelin.  The perfect end to the perfect album.
B00004TDTO|5.0|<br />Have you seen the film? If so, you'll recognize that line. This guy is scooping chum into the water to attract the shark, talking over his shoulder, and when he turns back to face the sea, the open maw of a giant white shark is all he sees, and the critter is about to take his arm off. He gives it that significant silent pause, then says, \\"Hey, guys? We're gonna need a bigger boat.\\" <br />It's SO PERFECT. <br />I loved this film when I first saw it a billion yrs ago, back when the earth was cooling, and I love it still. It's about a big shark that these guys are stalking so their peaceful little tourist town can resume business as usual. But then things turn hairy and scary when they realize that, actually, the shark is stalking them. Benchley's original book is pretty faithfully rendered in Spielberg's screen version. Especially well done are the scenes that pit the scientists and level headed sheriff against the politicians who just want all this nonsense downplayed so they can start making money again. <br />I slept just fine after watching it, but my husband had nightmares about sharks coming thru the bedroom walls all night for the next several nights, so...viewing discretion advised for those of tender sensibilities. It IS a little gory in a few spots. <br />
B00005JM1F|5.0|Just thought I'd add my 2 cents since I didn't see anyone else bring this up, but I thought the director's commentary on this DVD was great.  All three main actors and the director Todd Phillips discuss making the movie, and they are all really funny.  They talk a bit about technical matters, but mainly it's just a group of guys hanging out and cracking each other up.  The stuff about Luke Wilson's eyebrows (affectionately nick-named Kevin and Shorty) is hilarious.  If you've got the disk or are planning on buying it, be sure to check out the commentary.  It's well worth it.
B000000H57|5.0|As a journalist specializing in progressive rock, I hardly expected to like this. I'm glad Peter doesn't take himself seriously-although the Count Chocula accent on this LP is a little much sometimes. That said, October Rust doesn't posess the heaviness of Bloody Kisses but instead forges its own unique and really indescribable sound. It dabbles in electronica and even prog, and while not technically complex, it is still an amazing piece of work. I think of it as the soundtrack to an eerie fall; even though I live in season-less california, I always remember the leaves falling from the trees on the streets of D.C. where I used to live. It's definitely one of, if not the best, \\"goth\\" cds of the past ten years. On a side note, fans of TON might also wanna check out the bands H.I.M. and Poisonblack if they're into goth with a metal edge to it.
B00028HBKM|1.0|Love Mel Gibson.  But this movie was so dark I wanted to shake the screen.  I know it was a dark day but good godness help me, I disliked this movie.  I guess it's one of those movies, either you love it or hate it.  I'm in the later.  I keep thinking of something good to say about this, but I just cannot.  So if you are questioning if this movie is worth the time to see it, it probably is not.
B00005JMXX|4.0|I will agree with the other reviews, the plot was questionable, and laughable at times. However, not all movies are made to win academy awards. Many are made to be enjoyed like a ride. George Lucas and James Cameron have made billions with this concept. It is hard to say this movie is that bad when it made $187 million in the US, and $525 million worldwide. I think the director and the studio are laughing all the way to the bank and could care less that so many think it was horrible. If it was that bad, word of mouth would have sunk it in the tradition of Jackie Chans last film. The fact is, if you want to watch a film that will make you laugh and relax, I would recommend this film. If you want to watch the next Citizen Kane, this film is definetly not for you.
B000002G87|3.0|The performances by Eric Clapton, Duane Allman and the rest are outstanding.  In my opinion, neither of the CDs Original or Remastered come close to holding a pick to the 5 star performance.  I have the Vinyl - GREAT!.  I have both CDs, the Original has very poor high end, one hears the cymabals once in a while, some lead guitar buried.  I bought the Re-Mastered hoping for better.  The re-master in my opinion is worse.  The guitar is sometimes in your face, sometimes buried, the bass is just a boom.  If I were the Engineer of either, I would be embarassed.  If I were E.C., I would go for a third try and supervise.
B0002MPU1K|5.0|This is probably one of the best and most innovative CD's I've bought in a long time. It is quite obvious that Cincotti's skills as a pianist are extraordinary, as he displays on such tracks as \\"I Love Paris\\" and \\"Cherokee\\", but what surprised me and impressed me most about Cincotti's 2nd CD is his skill as a songwriter. I haven't heard such well crafted songs, both musically and lyrically, since the days of the Beatles, early Elton John, Billy Joel and Stevie Wonder. His talent to communicate to the listener is extremely unique, and I highly recommend this CD to anyone who is a music lover.
B0000640SB|3.0|I originally saw this movie at the cinema, but it doesn't have the same impact on DVD. Most films don't, I know, but the impact is severely lessened in my opinion. The film is still great, and Will Smith does look loads better in the last suit he'll ever wear than Tommy Lee Jones.<br /><br />One of my favourite scenes in the whole movie is where Jay gets left in charge of delivering what can only be described as a baby squid. It's an absolutely hilarious scene, even though you're supposed to be concentrating on Kay in the foreground of the scene, you can't help but watch Jay get thrown about!<br /><br />One of the other brilliant scenes is the scene where Kay shows Jay some of the aliens on earth at the moment being watched, and Jay points out his old school teacher. Some of the more known celebrities on screen are: Danny DeVito, director Barry Sonnenfeld, Chloe Sonnenfeld (Barry's daughter), Sylvester Stallone (he's the one everyone spots), Dionne Warwick, George Lucas, and executive producer Steven Spielberg. I love all the jokes regarding the aliens on the planet, saying they're all cab drivers, and the very last scene is absolutely fantastic, and really effective.<br /><br />Tommy Lee Jones is also funny, particularly when the car is driving upside down, and he's singing along to Elvis (Jay: \\"You do know Elvis is dead, right?\\" Kay: \\"No, Elvis is not dead. He just went home.\\") The other shots you have to look for, but it's when Will Smith says something funny, and Tommy is trying to cover the fact he's trying desperately not to laugh.<br /><br />There's plenty extras on the 2-disc special edition (which means I'm probably not reviewing the correct one, as there's so many 'editions' of this movie out there), but my favourite is the \\"Men In Black\\" music video. I love the way Mickey dances. There's your usual, bog standard commentaries by Barry Sonnenfeld & Tommy Lee Jones; character animation studies; tunnel scene deconstruction; extended & alternate scenes; storyboard comparisons (I HATE these!); metamorphis of Men In Black documentary; theatrical trailers; art gallery; scene editing workshops; Edgar bug fight sceen deconstruction and creatures: concept to completion. So basically, you're getting more than your money's worth if you're interested in this sorta thing.<br /><br />This is a terrific movie, and well worth getting. I probably shouldn't say you should get the sequel as well!; storyboard comparisons (I HATE these!); metamorphis of Men In Black documentary; theatrical trailers; art gallery; scene editing workshops; Edgar bug fight sceen deconstruction and creatures: concept to completion. So basically, you're getting more than your money's worth if you're interested in this sorta thing. <br /> <br />This is a terrific movie, and well worth getting. I probably shouldn't say you should get the sequel as well!
B00000J7SS|5.0|Miles Davis is arguably the best jazz artist in history, and this is his most seminal album. To note: this was not his first venture into the parallel universe of jazz-fusion. That title goes to his album \\"In A Silent Way.\\" Most certainly though this is his most controversial and remembered album. Just for those reasons alone does \\"Bitches Brew\\" earn a crown that shouts it's excellence everywhere. But what about the music itself? Without it Jazz Fusion may never have picked up the noteriety and appeal that it did. Thus we would never have Smooth Jazz, the modern amalgamation of Jazz Fusion and New Age music. It is most definitely an experimental album, but that should in no way detract anyone from purchasing it. It is alien and familiar at the same time; the sounds are quite strange, but distinctly Miles Davis. This is a masterpiece both of Jazz and experimental music, and any fan of either genre should make sure their collection is graced by this exceptional album.
B0000636UN|1.0|Sheryl got better and better with each album, finally blowing my mind with \\"The Globe Sessions.\\" She was *not* the pop queen everyone seems to want to make her out to be. Her true talent lay in folk & blues songwriting, for which her voice is uniquely suited.  <br /> <br />This album... this album was written by a completely different woman, and it sounds like it was written hurriedly to satisfy a contract obligation. There's no real soul in this album. Following up with that horrid Kid Rock duet didn't restore my faith in her any, either. <br /> <br />If you want to know the real Sheryl Crow, get \\"Tuesday Night Music Club,\\" \\"Sheryl Crow,\\" or \\"The Globe Sessions.\\" They're infinitely better.
B0002EXH5O|5.0|Its hard to believe this album is well over 15 years old.  It sounds as if it could have been recorded this year.  The music found here is heavy, beautiful, and complex as can be.  The solos, the riffs, and the lyrics are just crazy good.  Its so hard to find great Metal albums like this now.  Megadeth really know how to make a great album, always have, this is just another brilliant example of their true greatness.  Awesome for anyone looking to start a Deth collection.
0767817478|1.0|First of all, I am a huge G-Fan, so if you think that the old Godzilla movies \\"are dumb\\" or \\"have crappy special effects\\", don't even bother reading this review. In fact, you should go lie down in the middle of the expessway. Anyway, on to the review.    This is not Godzilla. This is not the indistructable, imortal, invincible behemoth that obliterates Tokyo, beats the crud out of the military, destroys Tokyo again, gets hit with eleventy billion missles, and inadvertantly saves the world from another giant monster. This thing is an outsized homosexual iguana that burrows underground, eats fish instead of nuclear reactors, runs away from the military, blows stinky wind instead of an atomic ray, makes goo-goo eyes with Ferris Beuller, and dies after getting hit with a few missles. I hate this movie, and anyone in there right mind should too. So go ahead, make fun of the old movies. They're way better than any Hollywood trash out there.
B000063DHL|5.0|When a Metal band starts exploring with different sounds, they usually lose many fans and become soft.  Not Iron Maiden.  This is a sure classic Maiden album; truly one of their best.  The melodies and musicianship are untouchable here.  The band was reaching their peak during this time.  This album is certainly a metal masterpiece.
0156027321|4.0|I found myself wishing for traffic jams as I listened to the audio version of this book.  Pi's jumbled life, the ship, the animals, his Gods, and Richard Parker all nudged me to think about reality - and what passes for reality. <br /> <br />There are parts that were tedious; no argument there. At the time, I'd think \\"ok, enough. you've named 3 flowers. no need to enumerate the other 12 you see.\\"  Upon reflection, though, I'm less frustrated by those passages.  They add clarity to the present reality. <br /> <br />The audio book version is outstanding.  The reader's accent and inflection compliment the story, adding strength to the illusion that it is the retelling of an event.   <br /> <br />I'd listen to it again, and am actually thinking about buying a print copy, so that I can more easily reread passages... particularly the thought provoking interviews near the end.
B0002S94OS|5.0|When I heard about this cd at ozzfest I was excited to get it but didnt think they had a chance at releasing something as good as 'As the palaces burn'. Fortunately, I was wrong. This Cd is better. I listen to it almost daily and I own hundreds of Metal cds. The first 4 songs are unbelievably good and the last 7 are amazing. Buy this, along with the new Devildriver, and Fear Factory CD.
1400032717|5.0|I was thankful for the traffic this morning, lengthening my already long drive so that I could enjoy a few more chapters.  <br /> <br />I'd recommend this to anyone who is not bound to a rigid story line, and truly think this is a better book to listen to, than to read. I would be tempted to skip bits if I were reading it - something that's impossible in the audio book... and those bits are all part of what makes this book so engrossing. (Where will Christopher's story take us next?)  <br /> <br />The narrator, too, is a wonderful bonus, gained as a result of the audio edition. He provides the right tone and voices - far better than my own inner voice.
B00009RAJJ|5.0|My opinion of Tusk itself hasn't changed much since I bought the LP back in 1979. It was a welcome 180 degree  turn from Rumours, which preceded it. Lyrically and musically it's just a mess - a stew, if you will - but that's not a bad thing. It's just all over the place. Lindsey's Buckingham's songs reek of cocaine paranoia, Stevie Nicks' songs are the same mystical/romantic tunes, and Christine McVie's songs are still beautifully crafted and full of hooks - pure pop celebration. The only differences here ( which for me makes this a 5 star album, not the 4 stars I gave it when first released on cd ) are the improvement in sound overall. IT SOUNDS FANTASTIC. Especially when heard with a good set of headphones. There's so much going on, buried in the mix, background vocals that I never heard before, things like that. Also, the full length version of Sara is here, like it was on the original LP. The bonus disc of demo recordings and out takes are for fans only, an interesting look into the process of recording itself.
B00028HBL6|5.0|This movie may come across as strange or confusing or possibly unrealistic. The sad fact is that the acts shown in this movie are historically accurate. If anything, it has downplayed the beatings and horrible things that were done. The whipping alone had actually lasted hours. He was whipped one whip short of death. Mel Gibson did a great job on presenting this the death of Jesus. What moved me the most was that Jesus willingly endured all of this. This movie is not about Jews verses Christian. Jesus was a Jew by the way. What happened was a historical event the people who wanted him cruxified happened to be jews, but a large majority of the people who followed him and worshipped him were also Jewish. We do not change the history of Germany in movies, because showing what Hitler did to the Jews may come across as anti-german. It happened. We cannot change history. This movie was a great historical movie! I encourage everyone who is curious to learn more about Jesus to pick up a Bible and read the parts (books) called Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John.It's the most accurate way to learn about the life of Jesus! The best book I have ever read!
B00008G9JN|5.0|I realize this is only one man's opinion, but I do believe Songs From the Wood is Jethro tull's finest hour. I can't think of a more cohesive, complete album by Tull (with the possible exception of Aqualung).Inspired by Ian Anderson's move to the country, the album rings with good will. Even a potentially depressing song as Velvet Green has merit. Lyrically it's depressing, musically, exciting. <br />Ring out, Soltice Bells is my favorite song on this album, and the fade-out with the bells ringing is beautiful. Barrie Barlow shows his stuff on these songs. What a magnificent drummer he is!!Listen to Hunting Girl and pay attention to the drumming on that particular number. It doesn't get any better than that. <br />The inclusion of Beltane makes perfect sense. It slots in nicely with the theme of the album. So, even if you are not a Tull fan, but are merely curious, start with SFTW as opposed to something with which you are overly familiar, such as Aqualung or Thick as a Brick. You will not be disappointed.
B000089RVR|5.0|I bought this CD just for one song, \\"White Flag.\\" Boy, was I in for a treat. This album is simply fantastic. There is really only one song that I don't care for \\"Do You Have a Little Time,\\" but the rest are great listening. <br /> <br />My favorite is \\"Don't Leave Home;\\" the melodies and deep bass reel me in on that one. <br /> <br />I am now a Dido fan! It's nice to have some real music.
0679411585|5.0|My husband, Sgt. Bill Mullins, was in the battle of the Ia Drang and I have researched many books and documentaries regarding the Vietnam War.  This is truly the finest book written about Vietnam, the Ia Drang Valley and the Air Mobile unit.  This book also pays tribute to the wives of these fine soldiers and lets the reader know what they went through at home. I have had the good fortune to meet some of the survivors of the Ia Drang, including Lt. Gen Hal Moore and Joseph Galloway, all of whom are true heroes.
1878424114|5.0|It is hard to explain why this book is so good. In short it tells you what you want to know in a very simple and nice manner. Its not just a guide but also an eye opener. Great book, i really recommend it to anyone who has compelling dreams from their hearts that they wish to fulfill. I read the book called 'The Alchemist' before The Seven Spiritual Laws of Success. The Alchemist is like an example describing the guidelines this book gives. I would strongly suggest reading both.
B00005JMH2|1.0|It's a crime that Mirimax has never released the original movie on DVD, just on VHS, but the sooner this &#34;american remake&#34; is out, the sooner there will be pressure to &#34;compare&#34; it to the original Japanese version; maybe Mirimax will get off their stupid duffs and release the good one on DVD. <br /> <br />There are almost no american remakes of foreign movies that don't  suck rocks. Some great examples include &#34;Scent of a Woman&#34;, &#34;The Postman/Il Postino&#34;.....(I just can't think of more because the butchery was so painful to see). <br /> <br />Anyway, go or don't go to the remake; who cares.  There can't be anything as close to violations of culture as there was in the original that showed a lapse in the strictly-conformist behavior  that saw Ballroom dancing as a moral, cultural and ideological taboo.  What in America is Richard Gere gonna do that violates our taboos?  Pulp fiction, Kill Bill, Mystic River, etc. have already been there, done that. <br /> <br />The remake will probably be a typical blockbuster romance comedy that really is neither, lacking the depth of thought or behavior needed to even approach the original. <br /> <br />&#60;Rant mode off&#62;
B0000D96NW|5.0|Current and former Machine Head fans: prepare to fall in love all over again. \\"Through The Ashes Of Empires\\" is MH's triumphant comeback from 2001's less than satisfactory \\"Supercharger.\\" Everything you ever loved about the band is on display here. Personally, I was a big fan of their third album \\"The Burning Red,\\" which pretty much put a divider between fans. That album is what started the evolution of Machine Head, which unfortunately caused them to water down their sound a bit on the aformentioned \\"Supercharger\\" (was it the record label? was it greed? who knows) to fit in with the nu-metal movement of the time. That experimentation and broadening was a good thing, nevertheless, and \\"Through The Ashes Of Empires\\" carries on the tradition. It is true to form, yet still tends to go in directions you don't expect. Now, the nu-metal influence is still somewhat audible here (especially on \\"Bite The Bullet,\\" which sounds straight out of the Disturbed song-book), but such moments are handled a bit more gracefully and competently than before, which in turn makes these moments much better than what is currently considered nu-metal. The opening track, \\"Imperium\\" is the perfect primer for this album. It's a roaring anthem with all of the Machine Head dynamics that we love. Other tracks, however, tap into a more emotional and personal vein. \\"Left Unfinished\\" and \\"Blue Skies Turn To Grey\\" are two in particular that focus on frontman Rob Flynn's childhood and being abandoned by his real parents. \\"Left Unfinished\\" is built up more on rage, and earns the album it's explicit label (also, Flynn's real name is revealed if you listen closely). The album as a whole flows very nicely and every song is superb. I'm gonna take a risk here and say that this is the definitive Machine Head album. This is the band at their hungriest and most intense. They really had something to prove with this release, and boy, did they. If you ever had an interest in Machine Head, you owe it to yourself to check out \\"Through The Ashes Of Empires.\\"check out \\"Through The Ashes Of Empires.\\"
B0002DB52M|4.0|First, I do agree with some of the reviewers that criticized director's point of view. However, the opposition should not be silenced, and if this is the way Von Trier imagines the social interactions so be it. On the artistic level this film works fairly well. Barely present scenery in function of revealing dark secrets of life in a small town (Twin Peaks, anyone?). Deux at machina resolution as the well worked out ending to the, essentially, tragic play. Overall atmosphere of bleaknees contributes well to the artistic intent.  <br />To sum up, I don't think it's fair to disregard this movie on the ideological ground.
0780622553|2.0|Dark City had everything going for it that good science fiction needs.  It had envisioned a deeply intriguing \\"city\\" in which an alien race uses people to feed on their negative emotions, where every person in the city begins again with new memories and feelings each time the aliens rebuild the city to create another wholly stressful environment for its citizens.  It has all the tools it needs to create a masterpiece; unfortunately, it almost ends up flat on its face. <br /> <br />The film tries to be plot-driven, but no matter how interesting the plot is, it won't properly develop if nobody cares about the main character.  Proyas and Sewell fail to convince anybody that John Murdoch truly wants the reality his actions suggest he so craves.  The other characters are even worse, with Dr. Schreber being one of the most annoying and unsympathetic \\"mad doctor\\" characters to date. <br /> <br />What ultimately makes this movie take the plunge, however, is the ending.  After all the fighting he's done, John Murdoch is perfectly content to live in his (FAKE) city by the sea.  This is perhaps the most unsatisfying and uninspired conclusion to a story this interesting.  How is a man, who has risked life and limb to experience reality again, happy to live out his days in a city he controls with his mind, filled with people who don't even know who they are?  But for anybody who really knows happiness (or has simply read Brave New World), happiness doesn't come without sorrow, and leaves the film with an empty, soulless feel. <br /> <br />The Matrix, despite its clunky sequels, paints a much deeper and richly human picture than its predecessor, Dark City.  An intriguing premise, but it just doesn't deliver.
B00005JMEW|5.0|KILL BILL vol.1 is by far the best film i have seen in my first 21 years... it has action, depth, blood, hotties (vivica, lucy, and uma in one movie, come on!!!!)  and a killer soundtrack... Quentin did his thang in this movie.... i have not loved a movie this much since his last movie JACKIE BROWN....<br /><br />Uma thurman gives a powerhouse emmy-worthy performance and does not even try in this movie.... the only problem with this movie was... NOTHING.... i cannot think of anything wrong with this movie....<br /><br />If you are a big fan of Quentin, and love non stop action.. this movie is for you.... \\"revenge is a dish best served cold\\"
B0002TKFGI|4.0|These are some of the RCA Red Seal Classic recordings from their<br /><br />Living Stereo series remastered for SACD. The Saint-Saens<br /><br />recording comes from a recently discovered Three Channel master<br /><br />tape, so on the SACD Surround portion of the disc you hear Left,<br /><br />Center, and Right channels only. Not 5.1 or 4.0. What you do hear<br /><br />are Three of Charles Munch's finer recordings with the Boston<br /><br />Symphony Orchestra. The recordings made in 1956 and 1959, manage<br /><br />to stand the test of time, and are welcome additions to the SACD<br /><br />catalog. Especially at Mid Price. Hopefully these Ten SACDs will<br /><br />be the first of many. One recording I hope will be issued on SACD<br /><br />is the Berlioz Requiem with Munch, The BSO and Leopold Simoneu.<br /><br />Also Maestro Munch's recording of the Berlioz Symphonie<br /><br />Fantastique
B0001UL7RY|1.0|This was a bit different from her first CD.  I'm disappointed...
0452270073|4.0|That a historical novel came across as readable as it did was surprise enough for me, but after completing the reading of Regeneration, I respected it purely as a piece of literature, period.    Barker's roving plotlines, sometimes switched by the mere presence of a new character in a scene, were weaved together in a way that lent believability and drama to what was surely an excellent combination of history and fiction.  Though I found some of Barker's dialogue hard to follow and the characters (with the exception of Sassoon, Owen and Rivers, who the reader obviously identifies most with) names a little difficult to keep straight, they nonetheless worked well enough to create a foundation for some superb storytelling.    The strict Freudian psycho-analysis present throughout the book got on my nerves at times.  The sexual layers that the characters constantly talked about didn't come across to me in any of the dream sequences where they were supposedly abundant.  I did however like the ambiguity of certain characters sexual orientation, as well as Rivers' self-analysis sessions, which gave you a deep look into his character.    The shaping and wordplay of the novel itself was also excellent, with some beautiful descriptions and a variety of useful and telling metaphors and similes.  Barker was well deserving of the Booker Prize, without a doubt.  I would happily recommend her work to anyone.
B0000E1ALR|5.0|Essential is for those new to Bruce and with limited budget AND for those die-hard fans (but not for fans in between).  <br /> <br />For Die-Hard Boss fans: <br /> <br />The bonus CD itself is worth the $15-20 alone. You will also recognize some amazing songs are left of the first two CDs like Candy's Room, My City of Ruins, Johnny 99, State Trooper, Highway Patrolman, Incident of 57th, Racing in the Street, etc as well as some songs on these CDs that may not be your favorites like Dancing in the Dark, Leap of Faith, Tunnel of Love, etc. Who cares about the first 2 discs if you are a die-hard Springsteen fan you have it all anyway except the rarities disc. If you are a die-hard fan you know the rarities disc 3 ranks up there with some of his best. Springsteen often wrote 100's of songs for 1 album only to pick the 10-15 songs that fit a certain theme which left off quite a few jems. The ones that didn't make it on those theme based LPs/CDs appear on the 18 Tracks, Tracks Box, and this Bonus CD. The die-hard fans will also recognize how many of these songs were played at his concerts but never released. Again, for you die-hards the bonus disc alone is worth the $20. If you liked the Tracks box or 18 tracks you will love the 12 Tracks on the bonus CD too! Only a couple of which you may have on LP or tape but not CD unless you have some bootlegs. <br /> <br />For those of you new to the Boss and/or with a limited budget: <br /> <br />This is a great introduction. Much better than the other Greatest Hits CD from 1995 with Murder Incorporated, This Hard Land etc. If you like what you hear on the Essential and can part with the cash, pick the eras you like best and then go after those studio albums. Note there is nothing from the Live 75 - 85 box set which is a shame. Although there are better live bootlegs which are full show (Passiac 9.19.1978), the Live Box set really gives the new Springsteen fan or curious music fan a better idea of what an amazing songwriter, lyricist, singer, performer, guitarist, trabadour, bandleader and artist that is (or was) Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band. That is if you are willing to part with $30-$50 to get the Live 75-85 CD box set. If not this Essential CD set with bonus disc is your best place to start. If you like what you hear and want to pursue more I suggest starting first with \\"Born to Run\\", then \\"Darkness on the Edge of Town\\", and finally \\"The River\\". If you are still hooked I also recommend The Ghost of Tom Joad if you like the folk stuff. Very folky so not much there for the music, song structure etc., but very moving because of the great lyrics, mood and truth that comes from deep within the Boss. From there if you want more check out \\"The Wild, Innocent, and the E Street Shuffle\\", \\"Born in the USA\\" and \\"Nebraska\\". Still hooked? Get the rest starting with the Live Box 75-85. Only ones I caution you on is \\"Greeting from Asbury Park\\", \\"MTV Plugged\\" and \\"Human Touch\\". Best avoid those three unless you are obsessed which is beyond die-hard.  <br /> <br />For those Springsteen fans in between new and die hard: <br /> <br />Forget it. Don't waste your money.
B00005ATZT|5.0|Harrison Ford plays Dr. Richard Kimble, a wealthy Chicago surgeon wrongfully accused of murdering his wife (Sela Ward). In truth, a one-armed man killed his wife. Kimble is convicted and sent to prison, Kimble escapes in a riveting bus/train crash. Pursued by U.S. Marshal Sam Gerard (Tommy Lee Jones, in his famous Oscar-winning role), Kimble misses being captured numerous times, all involving spectacular chase sequences. But as he begins to do a little investigating of his own, Kimble discovers that his wife's murder was not random, and that there may be other conspirators. <br />This is, without a doubt, one of the finest thriller/adventure films ever made. \\"The Fugitive\\" hits all the right notes. Ford's performance is particularly impressive; it's beyond me why he didn't get an Oscar nomination. Jones superbly matched him. Every actor did an excellent job, and direction by Andrew Davis (\\"Under Siege\\") is great. A must-see for all movie lovers. But, who hasn't seen this movie?
B000002JS8|5.0|I've been listening to this record since 1979 and it sounds just as good in 2004 -if not better compared to some of the pallid garbage out nowadays- as it did then.  The songwriting, playing, recording, and mastering unveil the truth about this band and where they were in 1979.  A true R&R masterpiece.
B00005AQE8|5.0|Many of us REAL hip hop heads are knowin' that All Eyez On Me was the 1st of it's kind and that on this particular release we 1st saw 2Pac meet Makaveli(and lyrical West Side representation at it's best f/m 'Pac and the collabs), the production was HOTTT from start to finish(Death Row's production was hip hop's finest back in the 90's), and this album set a trend for the infamous double LP. I'm not even gonna list my fav's cause they were all some of the HOTTTEST joints Pac ever released since gettin' outta fed, but to the critics sayin' he was evil, sexist,wack,etc...you either didn't know or inquire of the man behind the music, and probably were among those who considered Pac hip hop until he started cappin' on Biggie, Bad Boy, Mobb Deep, Nas, Jay-Z, and the rest o' them. Pac was just bein' Pac...the Realest and the Greatest Of All Time. Makaveli,R.I.P.
B0002S947K|5.0|This album is shockingly good.  Absolutely fantastic, heart-felt voice.  I can't listen to it enough.  Good from start to finish.  Wish there were ten more songs on it!  Buy this album!
B000075BFK|2.0|Here we have the 2nd of posthumous 'Pac releases from his Makaveli period...and unlike \\"Until The End of TIme,\\" I could only give this one a 3 because, while the lyrics are HOTTT, and the production is not that bad either, this album is so REMIXED and RESTRUCTURED that it actually pained me to listen to it from start to finish. The only hitters on here to me were \\"Late Night,\\" on which 'Pac shines lyrically over DJ QUIK's productive genius, which features a BOMB sample of Donald Byrd's \\"Wind Parade,\\" and \\"Who Do You Believe In.\\" These 2 joints in particular were done the way Pac wanted em to be done. The only other hits were \\"Changed Man,\\" \\"Thugz Mansion(w/t and w/o Nas)\\", and Fame...and I barely gave  those a pass cause they were remixed out this world...and no matter how tight the Thugz Mansion joint is, 'Pac was beefin' with Nas(and talkin' bout cappin' him) so how's Suge gonna throw Nas in on the remix? Overall...this album is one for the younger hip hop generation...but die hards like myself will probably find it a lil irritatin' to hear 'Pac verses thrown in over generic,Lil John-ish club song tracks. Again, it's a shame that the original works can only be found on all those bootlef Makvaveli releases.Purchase Better Days only if you have an open enough mind...but if you ask me, 'Pac is somewhere cringin' at all these REMIXES. 2Pac,R.I.P.
B00006RU5B|5.0|Like many of those who already posted comments, I was initially attracted to Audioslave because of Chris Cornell and Soundgarden, not because of Rage...but what a great combination this group is. I hope this album wasn't just a one-time experiment. Since 1995 we've heard dozens of popcorn rock groups and none of them have been able to fill the vacuum left by grunge rock. Maybe I'm just a fading grunger (those who contemptuously accused our parents of being fading hippies...we all suffer similar fates- makes great drama and literature), but in terms of hard rock power and value I just hadn't been turned on until Audioslave formed. I'm SO happy that they did. They make me feel that there is still something left for me to listen to on the alternative radio station. And I'm always amazed by the big-city radio station tendency to play the same two or three songs from an album- in this case, \\"I Am the Highway,\\" \\"Cochise\\" and \\"Like a Stone\\"- all great songs but (relatively speaking) inferior to hard-hitting durges like \\"Shadow on the Sun\\" and \\"Bring 'Em Back Alive\\" (which I feel is the best song on the album). Maybe it's different out west where there aren't so many bean counters calculating 1/10th cent royalty payments? I LOVED this album...I just hope that these guys continue to work together.
0316666343|2.0|Ok so the beginning I have to admit I found intriguing. I could not put the book down at the part where Susie was first murdered by Mr. Harvey and the shock began to spread. But then afterwards it was just boring and slow and totally pointless. Why should I care? I do not feel any connection to any of the characters. What I do feel is amazement at how stupid some of the people can be, and I utterly dislike the characters of Lindsey and the little brother (I don't remember his name), the siblings of Susie the main character. Why? Because they were like empty shells, caricatures of real siblings of people who died, and the author tries so hard to MAKE their reactions \\"deep\\" and \\"emotion-evoking\\" but to me it's just all so sickeningly superficial. <br /> <br />I agree with some of the reviewers who said they hoped heaven was not like what it was portrayed to be in the book. That is just a BORING, unimaginative, unemotional place to be and I would be rather be unconscious than experience something like that.  <br /> <br />Finally, the dialogue of this novel...is just unbelievable. I've never read anything like it. To clarify: I've never read anything SO trite, so FAKE, and so unrealisitic that it was laughable. Not to spoil the novel or anything, but that part where the father helps Mr. Harvey build the tent and Mr. Harvey comes out with the white sheet and the father was like: \\"you know something\\" real ominous-like was ENTIRELY out of the blue...I was just stupefied. To give myself some credit, I tried, I REALLY tried. I re-read the whole passage over like five times and tried to dig for some subtle thing that I missed, but I'm sorry to say that I could not find anything that would redeem this passage. NOBODY TALKS LIKE THAT IN REAL LIFE. I know this novel is fiction, but dialogue like that is extremely distracting and I absolutely hate it when the author tries to make the dialogue contain \\"hidden, deep\\" meaning when it's just a load of BS.  <br /> <br />I have nothingagainst the author, and I apologize if this scathing review offended those who loved this novel (a lot of my friends did), but I do feel strongly about the bad dialogue, characterization and plot of this novel. I do not understand, and I never will, why anyone would like this book. But that's just me. =)
0553712837|1.0|If this message saves just one person from reading this book, then I know I have done my job. What a waste of time. It has a truly predictable plot and &quot;seen that, done that&quot; story line. It is almost as if John Grisham was going for the make a few million when turned into yet another cheesy holiday movie plot. DO NOT READ THIS BOOK...PLEASE!!!
B0002DB52M|5.0|'Dogville' was the type of film that I never would have expected, and never will forget. The most obvious, and odd, part of the film was that there was barely a set - no walls, no doors, just a chalk outline of what is supposed to be there, along with minimalist amounts of furnishings. <br /> <br />This works on a few levels. First, it is symbolic with the plot: breaking barriers to the human condition, seeing people for who, and what, they really are. Second, the lack of walls shows audiences the true talents of the actor. Indeed, the actor must employ imagination and true feeling in order to be engrossed in the plot and their character's condition, rather than fixed on the lack of props. <br /> <br />On that note, Nicole Kidman, as well as the other actors, did a stellar job in her character study. Once you are engaged in her performance, the no-walled set seems to not matter anymore, while you are more focused on the characters and what is happening in Dogville. <br /> <br />I would also have to say that 'Dogville' is a film not to be taken lightly. It is definitely one of those films to think about, and that can be proposed as an allegory to modern society. Can people really help themselves? Should the wronged forgive? What can one person to in this world to simply survive? This film also questions moral judgement, as well as questioning how far is too far. <br /> <br />The film has a startlingly unpredictable ending, but one that I found rather satisfying considering all that had happened in the preceding three hours. You may be left shaken, but 'Dogville' is one of those films that you just have to see. <br /> <br />Finally, I was also impressed with the cinematography. Besides the set, the lighting was also very creative, moving from light to dark in symbolic ways. The film also has a gritty, raw feel to it, as if it is more 'real.' I also found the voice-overs rather necessary, and at times, funny. <br /> <br />Overall, I give 'Dogville' five stars, for it was an excellent film that everyone should see at one point in time.
B00028HBKM|1.0|I am not a Christian, but I wanted to see the movie because of all the hype...and what a waste of time! If you aren't familiar with the individuals who took part in the death of Jesus, you will have no idea what is going on.  Why was he killed?  Who where the \\"guys in the hats\\" who called for his death?  Who were the people who cared about him and why?  A few flashbacks give you an inkling, but the lack of a story line gives you no opportunity to become involved in the story.  NO chance that anyone will be drawn to Christianity by this film! <br /> <br />The violence was apalling, and I think that Mel Gibson (who I have always enjoyed) must be a bit twisted to focus so graphically and completely on the crucifixion without presenting it within the context of Jesus' life.  Just a graphic gore-fest legitimized by the religious theme.
B0001FR3IQ|4.0|I was in the mood for a good, suspenseful, scarey movie. So I rented 'Gothika,' since I heard that it was very, very scarey. <br /> <br />NOTE: If you're looking for a thrill ride/ultimate scare, pass this one up. <br /> <br />Halle Berry does an excellent job portraying Dr. Miranda Grey, who works in a mental institution. She has trouble believing the outlandish tales that the inmates tell her, until she becomes one herself. <br /> <br />'Gothika' employs the use of paranormal, with ghosts and possessions taking the majority of the explanations, and the film. <br /> <br />However, there are some rather suspenseful, and awe-inspiring parts of the film, like Berry's multiple attempts at escape, and also parts in which the ghost visits her cell. Toward the end, the film becomes somewhat predictable, but nevertheless, suspenseful. And it does all make sense in the end! <br /> <br />Overall, I believe that 'Gothika' is worth four stars.
B0000DZTIW|5.0|I have enjoyed a number of Hans Zimmer's scores but I must rate this as one of his best and fast becoming my favorite. <br /> <br />The words that come to mind as I play this CD while writing this review are lush, exotic, melodic, romantic, evocative, relaxing, majestic and mythical.  Hans Zimmer uses his signature percusion and strings in this and other scores to create lush tone poems.  <br /> <br />For me, scores which incorporate and utilize oriental sounds/themes have usually been exemplary and memorable(for example the beautiful score to \\"The Sand Pebbles by Jerry Goldsmith\\", another being the soundtrack from a old TV movie \\"Marco Polo\\" which unfortuately is no longer in print and also the soundtrack of \\"The World of Suzie Wong.\\" <br />  <br />It is a very cohesive score which could stand alone on it's own divorced from the screen.  I have not seen the movie but I can hear how this exquistely descriptive music would complement the drama taking place on the screen.  <br /> <br />This album is a worthy addition to a eclectic soundtrack lovers collection.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|The first time I listented to this CD, I was a little worried. As I sat there listening, I fell in love with the album!!! It is one of my altime FAVES!!!! Buy this album and there is no doubt about it, you will love it!    &amp;quot;Take me away&amp;quot; This song is one of my awesome!   &amp;quot;Together&amp;quot; This one is pretty good.   &amp;quot;Don't tell me&amp;quot; Don't tell me how good this song is!   &amp;quot;He wasn't&amp;quot; not my fave   &amp;quot;How does it feel&amp;quot; still, not my fave   &amp;quot;My happy Ending&amp;quot; My first or second fave, a really catchy chorus!   &amp;quot;Nobody's Home&amp;quot; Pretty good song!   &amp;quot;Forgotten&amp;quot; It's ok...   &amp;quot;Who knows&amp;quot; Again, it's ok...   &amp;quot;Fall to Pieces&amp;quot; Fantastic Ending!   &amp;quot;Freak Out&amp;quot; umm...?   &amp;quot;Slipped Away&amp;quot; A sad song, (I LOVE IT!!!)
B00008S2VG|1.0|Sometimes social commentary by musicians works, as in the case of Prince's \\"Money Don't Matter\\" and and Bruce Springsteen's \\"Streets of Philadelphia,\\" and sometimes it bombs.  This album bombs. One song would be tolerable, and even enjoyable, but an entire album of opinionated tripe?  I read that Madonna was upset that her fans didn't think she has the same right to political opinions as any normal citizen. Wrong--she has the right to her opinions, and I have the right not to care.  I consider myself a fan of her music, but this will be the last album of hers I buy without listening to it first.<br /><br />Besides the above problem, the songs themselves are poorly done.  With the exception of \\"Die Another Day\\" -  which was technically from another soundtrack ablbum - every track on here sounds the same.  Listening to it, I didn't even realize the tracks were changing until the CD stopped!  Her vocals barely overcome the music to be heard, and are fairly emotionless.  Avoid this album--buy Ray of Light or Music instead.  If you have those, save your money for someone else.
B00005JLR1|4.0|Treasure Planet is supposedly based on Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure Island. The animated movie was more specifically similar to Terry Brooks' trilogy about the Voyage of the Jerle Shannara. The special effects bring this book to life, as does the important \\"lost\\" treasure which, when found, proved useless because it is antiquated. In Brooks' story, the forbidden treasure was all the words in the language changed into a computer system which became outdated and was totally lost as all the books had been destroyed.  <br />The creatures are reminiscent of those seen in the bar of the first Star Wars movie. The action is what you'd expect if a movie were made of the Brooks' trilogy, the flights and fighting scenes with dangerous pitfalls.  <br /> <br />Not much of Stevenson's book written so long ago is in this modern sci-fi parody. Be sure to observe the four babies at the end: the future of our world? <br /> <br />
B00003CXCT|1.0|Sep. 15, 2004 <br />AP: Why not release both the originals and special editions on DVD?  <br /> <br />Lucas: The special edition, that's the one I wanted out there. The other movie, it's on VHS, if anybody wants it. ... I'm not going to spend the, we're talking millions of dollars here, the money and the time to refurbish that, because to me, it doesn't really exist anymore. It's like this is the movie I wanted it to be, and I'm sorry you saw half a completed film and fell in love with it. But I want it to be the way I want it to be.  <br /> <br />Me:  I want, I want, I want.... thats George Lucas for you.  When the issue is the original DVD's, a very big issue to fans, George doesn't care what the fans want, just what he wants.  That last line of his sums it all up to me.  The money and the time issues he brings up are sad excuses.  To say I lost a lot of respect for Lucas would be a huge understatement.
B000063DFQ|5.0|Wow....what a great album!  While I have not listened to a lot of Iron Maiden...yet...from what I have heard so far...they are really great!  This album has that classic progressive rock feel, along with some great song lyrics!  FLIGHT OF ICARUS has to be the best song on this one...closely followed by SUN AND STEEL.  This is a definite addition to any classic rock or heavy metal collection!
B0000TB050|5.0|What can I say!?  This DVD is unbelievable.  It took me back to the only U2 concert I had the honour of attending many years ago (not this one).  I felt like crying several times while watching (and maybe I did).  I hope to God that one day I may again see the greatest band in existence play live.  I feel sorry for all those who do not understand U2, but, to those who do... this one is for you!  WALK ON!
B00000IL67|5.0|This is a must have for all Alice Cooper fans. \\"Life and Crimes\\" is a four disk set that, in chronological order, showcases the genius that is Alice Cooper. You get quite a bit of the original Alice Cooper band's material from their 7 records together. I have seen other reviewers state that not enough disk space is given to the original band's material, but 2 of the four disks in the set are basically devoted to the Alice Cooper band years. You get all of the hits, \\"Eighteen\\", \\"School's Out\\", \\"Billion Dollar Babies\\" etc. but what I loved about this box set, is that for the first time I was able to hear the songs like \\"Don't Blow Your Mind\\" and \\"Hitch Hike\\", songs released when the band called themselves The Spiders. You get to hear how Alice and crew took a song called \\"Respect for the Sleepers\\" and re-tooled it into \\"Muscle of Love\\". You get a demo track \\"Call it Evil\\" that is lousy in production value, but as a fan, you can enjoy just the raw sound of the band at work. Alice's old bandmates even get a track \\"I Miss You\\" from thier Battle Axe album when they performed as The Billion Dollar Babies. There are so many unreleased and forgotten gems on disk 2 & 3, it's almost like discovering a new Alice Cooper album. You get Alice's great cover of the Beatles \\"Because\\" from the \\"Sgt. Peppers\\" movie he did with the Bee Gees. There are two songs from a Flash Gordon rock-opera that Alice performed, \\"I'm Flash\\" and \\"Space Pirates\\". A nice surprise are two songs from the fantastically awful horror movie \\"Monster Dog\\" Alice starred in, \\"Identity Crisis\\" and \\"See Me in the Mirror\\". Also in this set is the song that made it onto the Special Forces LP jacket, but not onto the record, \\"Look at You Over There (Ripping the Sawdust from my Teddy Bear\\". There is a great version of \\"Road Rats\\" from the \\"Roadie\\" soundtrack that sounds so much better than the Lace and Whiskey version, as well as a cleaned up version of \\"I Am the Future\\". And ending disk 3 you get \\"Hard Rock Summer\\" from the Friday the 13th soundtrack, that is just a great hair metal jam. On disk 4 there is a demo version of \\"He's Back\\" that was re-worked into \\"Trick Bag\\" off of Contrictor, plus the movie version of \\"He's Back\\" from the Friday the 13th soundtrack. Disk 4 also features quite a few songs that were attached to live albums or best-of's, \\"Is Anyone Home\\" and Alice's version of \\"Fire\\".<br /><br />If you go beyond the music, this box set has a great, informative booklet, with forward by Johnny Rotten of the Sex Pistols, and liner notes from Alice and bandmates about each of the songs. There are tributes to Alice from everyone from Dick Clark to Rob Zombie. As an Alice Cooper fan, this box set was just a great treat. If you are a fan of any of the Coop's music, pick this up! Hopefully, now that Alice has released 3 more studio albums since this box came out, he will have enough extra material to produce another box-set in the near future. Possibly with a song or two where he reunites with the surviving members of the original line-up?? We can only hope.m the Friday the 13th soundtrack, that is just a great hair metal jam.

B00003CWN3|4.0|I thought the movie was well-directed and well-acted. They briefly tried to show what loose cannons Tom and John were, although the actor portraying John Lotter played him far more intelligently than he was or is in reality.  Chloe Sevigny as Lana was beautiful, sloe-eyed, and mysterious, not to mention extremely understanding of Brandon's predicament, however her boo-hooing scene at the end was quite fake. Hilary Swank was completely convincing as Brandon, the girl who wanted to be a boy - so congenial and flattering that all the little girls wanted him.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the murder scene was very contrived and didn't ring true.  Actually, the only thing for sure that happened was that Lana's mom told John and Tom where to find Brandon, even though she knew that Brandon was in fear for his life for reporting that they had raped him.  Brandon wasn't murdered because he lied and deceived - he was murdered because a couple of morons thought that if Brandon was out of the way, he wouldn't be able to testify against them in a rape trial. They were unable to formulate the thought that instead of being tried for rape, they would most certainly be convicted of murder.
B000002IQW|5.0|I love this album so much.........its just.......mind-blowing(seriously!).When I first heard \\"Slave to the Grind\\" it hit me like no other album ever had.It is so heavy and the lyrics and riffs,Bach's vocals,Rachael's nose-ring!!!!!AHHHH!!!!!I can't get enought of it!Quicksand Jesus and Darkened Room will send chills down your spine..while Physco Love and Monkey Buisiness will make you screaming for more.It beats anyone's music today by far......and all these kids today listening to Marilyn Manson and crud......by Slave To The Grind and listen to some real music.
B00003CX9E|5.0|This is the movie to end all movies.  Everything about it is just amazing.  Story, acting, cinematography, music.  It is sad, poignant, funny, dramatic, and hits every right note.<br /><br />  Orson Welles, I must say is a cinematic genius.  The story begins with a newsreel about the death of Charles Foster Kane, newspaper giant, which begins to reveal the depth of Kane's character, and also his witticisms that help to define the way he lived his life.<br /><br />  Kane is a man who was sold to the bank as a child when his mother came into money, and he was raised in preparation for being very rich. Very rich he is through his life, and he amasses a great fortune in building a 'pleasure palace' in Florida called Xanadu, and collects rare statues, and about anything there is to buy. He is married twice to a politician's daughter, and then to a beautiful singer.<br /><br />  He himself runs for governor once, but loses, due to a scandal. All of this, by the way, is revealed in the opening sequence newsreel, so I am not spoiling the movie for anyone.  Anyway, Kane always sees himself as a spokesman for the people. And he wants people to love him, although he never truly can be a man of the people, because he is so gosh darn rich. At one point in the movie Kane says \\" If I hadn't been very rich, I would have been a great man.\\"<br /><br />  The dialogue in this film, is highly intelligent and telling, and always a pleasure to listen to.  Kane represents the fulfillment of the American dream, reaching the top, not merely by being raised with money, but by creating a name for himself with his ingenuity in running a newspaper.  His banker/ former guardian disapproves of his profession, but Kane carries on even if he's losing money, at first because he likes the fast pace and the public name he makes for himself.<br /><br />  Kane always maintains a sort of boyish innocence despite all of the money and fame.  He is not a bad guy, just very stubborn, and sheltered in a way, from how to live a normal life.  He gets everything he wants, loses it, and loses something very dear to him, that is dear to everyone, that is revealed at the end of the film.  This loss is so sad, and so easy to relate to.<br /><br />  This film, above all else, is highly intelligent, which is a feature that has become rare in the film world. The viewer is a participant in the unfolding story here, and is expected to be able to make connections to things they have seen earlier in the film.  Modern cinema, as a general rule, does not give the audience this much credit.  Here, Welles does, with Citizen Kane, and it is a real treat.<br /><br />  Every scene is beautifully composed, and the lush black and white photography, and innovating stage setting, is breath-taking.  The music, as well, contributes to the story, including a song \\"This can't be love,\\"  sung by a singer, when Kane and his wife go on a picnic.

B00005JMAH|3.0|From an avid fan of the books and absolutely love the first two movies along with my daughter, the third movie has it good parts as far as characters, keeping some of the same relationships but I don't think I've ever felt more rushed. The movie should have developed scenes more. The setting and darkness stunk. I like the old hogwarts setting and old Hagrids home. I also agree that Dumbledore needs his supreme posture back not a foolish old man type decorum. I try to convince myself that I like it but miss much of the old scenery etc.  <br /> <br />I sure hope the next movie is double length or made into two movies. I just has to do it justice. I know like most fans, I can't get enough of the first two movies and will probably watch the third almost as much. We watch the first two almost every other weekend and love them. We ask each other trivia questions about them in the car while traveling. We're hooked, but please get back to the original castle and scnenes. I don't like Cuaron's interpretation. Please get the original director back.
B0001ADAVK|2.0|'Mona Lisa Smile' is a period film in the 1950s America, about teacher of painting Kathrine Watson played by Julia Roberts.  The story slightly resembles that of 'Dead Poet Society' -- a teacher with a new idea, who makes a difference in uptight school -- but the film ends up with assorted scenes and dialogues with the cliched episodes about cliched characters. <br /> <br />Sorry if I sound harsh, but the film is really predictable, and safe.  Katherine teaches painting before the serious students whose concerns are memorizing the textbooks.  Some are rebels (like Maggie Gyllenhaal's character smoking Giselle); some only think of marriage (like Kirsten Dunst's conservative Betty, and, well, so on and on.  There is a romance surrounding Julia's character, but the love story is too shallow and forgettable.   <br /> <br />Now, what happens to each student, you can predict from the beginning; and what Katherine does, going against the grain (so she thinks), you can imagine from miles apart.  Instead of the course authorized by the school, Katherine shows the bedazzled students a piece of modern art -- what do you see?  Of course, Pollock.  Too predictable.     <br /> <br />But after all, the whole problem is this: 'Julia Roberts in a period film?  With Kirsten Dunst?'  If you remember their successful films, they are all set in contemporary situations -- like 'Erin' 'Pretty Woman' 'Ocean' or 'Spider-man' 'Bring it On' -- and these actresses here (I mean Julia Stiles or Maggie Gyllenhaal too) all look out of place.  They should have known that they start to shine in modern situation.  Mike Newell, who directed two great films 'Four Weddings and a Funeral' and 'Donnie Brasco,' clearly didn't see 'Mary Reiley.' <br /> <br />Coming from the writer team Lawrence Konner and Mark Rosenthal (whose scripts include Tim Burton's 'Planet of the Apes' and 'Mercury Rising' -- oh dear), 'Mona Lisa Smile' remains trite and boring from the begining to the end.  And the costumes are good, but when other parts are so lamentable, what is the point of watching the costumes? <br /> <br />The only actor who should be praised is Juliet Stevenson, who represents the unbending belief and confidence in her creed shown with a wicked sense of humor.  And that attitude is what Julia Roberts should have shown on the screen.  When Juliet Stevenson leaves (and too early), the film is dead.  And so lifeless 90 minutes more.
B0000C6E4D|5.0|I've long since it's release Nov. 4, 03 purchased this CD. I was moved to write this review to sway the undecided, and give it it's true 5 star justice.    <br /> <br />When I first purchased and first heard this CD in it's entirety I must admit I was left asking myself \\"that's it?\\" Then I realized I was looking for a sequel. I began to listen to it with more frequency and began to love it more with each play and quickly questioned and struck down my hasty initial response.  Suddenly it hit me! The truth of the matter is I was making comparisons (just as some of the earlier reviewers wrote) to Solace, Fumbling Towards Ecstasy, Surfacing and Mirrorball. I had realized that when comparisons are made with any artist's work your judgement becomes clouded with expectations to match or supersede your pinnacle of the artist. I forgot to really hear the music. I forgot to listen, I mean really listen and digest and mesh the lyrics and the wonderful instrumental feast that surrounds each song.  To those who say, \\"Afterglow is no Fumbling,\\" It's true, It's not but neither was Surfacing and nor will her next(and so on)each record in it's own right is a masterpiece. That's the beauty of Sarah and the difference between a singer and a singer/song writer. She writes about her own experiences and state of being. Afterglow is a different softer side to her we had still to see.  She chose to write about the present without a strict emotional agenda. She didn't go for the reserve and tap in to Solace, Fumbling or Surfacing to get her inspiration or even what she had been through the last 6 years since her hiatus, (loosing her mother, giving birth ((although a hint of them can be caught in some tracks)) material which I'm sure will surface later on. Instead a transitional Afterglow fit for the current times was born. A compromise between the familiar sound of Sarah and the new sound of Sarah.   <br /> <br />If you're looking for Sarah McLachlan you'll find her in this CD, and just aspowerful as you have in every other piece of work she's done. You'll find her soothing voice and her ever beautiful lyrics that provoke thought and real emotion.

B00008H2LB|2.0|...Well, here's my short little opinion on Linkin park, not that anybody's probably ever going to stumble across it in the mess of 1300+ other reveiws, and I'm probably not even going to say anything that hasn't been said already but... here goes. <br /> <br />My sister plays this cd CONSTANTLY when she's driving around (I'm 14, she's 16, our parents hate driving, hence she occasionally (bordering on often) drives me to after school classes and whatever I need to go to), and (semi-irrelevantly) it drives my parents crazy. I too, am no particular fan (however a few songs are catchy, Faint and Nobody's Listening are the ones I can think of right now), but I can see what others see in them. Just as a gentle touch or kind words produce soothing neurochemicals, harsh noises, screaming,  produce more acidic (so to speak) neurochemicals. Neurochemicals have a large part in moods, emotions, even perceived mental and physical well-being. Whereas lighter music makes you feel lighter, heavier music makes you feel heavier, saddier, angrier, in a somewhat cliched word, \\"angstier\\". The teenage demographic marketed to by such bands is usually think they are or have cause to be angsty as well, and they enjoy -staying- angsty, at their parents or how much their life sucks or whatever, and the said neurochemicals assist the process, and the lyrics embrace such feelings as well. <br /> <br />Simply, angry music keeps you angry. If that appeals to you, go for it; buy this cd. For me, I don't think paying $15+ for a cd containing a grand total of 2 songs I'd listen to is a wise choice. Especially when I could just copy them off my sister's. rofl.  <br /> <br />(I go for Modest Mouse and Tori Amos personally, but the parents think -they're- \\"satanic\\", even if less \\"nerve-racking\\". I guess one just can't win. ^_^)
B0002MPU1K|5.0|After so much hype about this kid, I recently bought Peter's first CD which I happened to really enjoy. But I certainly did not expect what was to come. \\"On The Moon\\" just blew me out of the water. It is clear that peter has found his own voice and has certainly developed tremendously in such a short period of time. This CD crosses over so many different genres of music while maintaining a certain musical continuity. Peter's talents as a pianist, singer, songwriter, and arranger are really overwhelming. All I can say is if you like music, you will love \\"On The Moon.\\"
0156027321|1.0|Too many people are panning this book who didn't even read the entire thing or skimmed past portions of it.  These are probably the same people who review films before they are released.  I avoided this book for the longest time, because I figured that a book about being lost at sea would be extremely boring.  However, the reviews at Amazon were so good, I finally caved in and read it.  The forward gave me much hope.  I found parts extremely funny (Indians speaking a strange English using words like \\"Bamboozled\\").  However, the book turned into exactly the kind of boring \\"lost at sea\\" tale I feared.  Although the ending did have an interesting twist (and a hilarious portion involving two Japanese investigators), the work of getting there was not worth it.  Some people loved this book, and I do not discount their opinions or ratings.  However, if you're like me and you dread the boredom of a shipwreck story, you may want to avoid this book.
B00028HBKM|2.0|Read Chuck Palahniuk's \\"Survior\\" instead, a much more interesting religious story..favorite quotes that relate to The Passion Of Christ are: <br /> <br />\\"If Jesus Christ had died in prison, with no one watching and with no one there to mourn or torture him, would we be saved?\\"  <br /> <br />.....  <br /> <br />\\"The biggest factor that makes you a saint is the amount of press coverage you get.\\"  <br /> <br />.....  <br /> <br />\\"The key to salvation is how much attention you get. How high a profile you get. Your audience share. Your exposure. Your name recognition. Your press following. The buzz.\\"  <br /> <br />From pages 152 and 151 of \\"Survivor\\"
B000002GBB|5.0|Styx's 1978 release of \\"Pieces Of Eight\\" is a masterpiece in the word of progressive pop/rock. Sure, nearly every Styx album has hits, but there are a select four or five that mix the glory of pop and progressive rock in such a way that it stands the test of time as a true album rock record, without any throw-away tracks. \\"Pieces Of Eight\\" presents Styx at their absolute best; constructing a tight album for progressive rockers and pop lovers alike.<br /><br />People will remember this album for it's radio hits the most - \\"Blue Collar Man\\" and \\"Renegade\\". The hits are fantastic songs, but the album tracks are what makes this album such a gem. Songs like \\"Sing for the Day\\", \\"Lords of the Ring\\" and the epic \\"Queen of Spades\\" are just as good if not better than the hits.<br /><br />I own about 9 Styx albums, and I feel this is their most seminal work. If your looking for a second album to buy, I would recommend \\"The Grand Illusion\\". I've seen them live twice; incredible both times; so I got to show love for Styx.
B00004T9AF|4.0|The remastering of this classic makes a huge improvement. My only gripe is that they kept the ending of the first album release, and didn't restore Mike Oldfield's original intended ending.<br /><br />The album was supposed to end with a drunken version of the Sailor's Hornpipe recorded live one morning, with semi-coherent commentary by Vivian Stanshall. That's the version on \\"Boxed\\", and I so wish it was the version on this release--so much so that I edited my own version by combining the two.<br /><br />This elderly recording has an earnestness and heart that shines through the limited recording technology available; warts and all, it's a better album than the 2003 re-recording.
6305508550|5.0|The satire in this movie is brilliant. There are a ton of people out there that experience the things parodied in this movie everyday. I for one, have fallen victim to the soulless corporations that bring in so called \\"efficiency\\" experts to \\"clean house\\".<br /><br />\\"Office Space\\" depicts characters so accurately that it's scary. It starts off with everyone trying to make it to work on time on a Monday; first getting stuck in rush hour, then dealing with several self-righteous bosses, then having a chipper red head remind them that it's Monday before they settle into their cubicles for the day. Their is almost a deja vu effect for the people that have experienced these things. Ah yes, it's a depressing feeling knowing your wasting your life away in a cubicle updating bank records for the year 2000 switch; which is also a hilarious scenario in the film, since nothing happened to computer systems when the year 2000 hit. The characters in this movie make it great. Milton mumbling \\"Have you seen my stapler?\\" to Bill Lumbergh's manipulative soft spoken a-hole-of-a-boss character.<br /><br />Another thing that makes this movie hilarious is all the rap music that's played. It's not softcore rap at all. It is very explicit hardcore gangster rap in many cases. One scene in the film where they are smashing a printer that they have always hated in the middle of a field with a rap song chanting \\"Die Mother Fu**a, Die Mother Fu**a, Die\\" is one of the funniest ideas I've ever seen a in a film.<br /><br />I think everyone would find this film funny, even if you don't work in an office setting, but if you do, you will find it even funnier.
B00000DATR|3.0|It's not the dreary new age rehash I was expecting. Sure, it's a bit easy listening in places, but mostly it's a synth-heavy reworking with a touch of techno styling.<br /><br />On balance, I like it a little more than Tubular Bells II, if only because it skips the Piltdown Man entirely rather than making it a joke, and because it's more subtle in its reworking of themes from the original Tubular Bells.<br /><br />I'd like it even more without the obligatory attempt at a hit single (\\"Man In The Rain\\") breaking up the flow, though.
B0002Z0EYA|5.0|This is the brutal speech of Agamenon in the first third of the film which preserved the intense epic gaze of this immortal work of the greatest european poet Homer .<br /><br />Obviously Petersen is not Kurosawa . Nevertheless Petersen makes a wonderful camera work . The cast is not entirely homogeneus . The ravishing presence of O'Toole as Priamo established such rank level than literally he sent to the rest of the cast to a very worthable second level; personally I suppose O' Toole at last will win a prize of the Academy as Best supporting actor in 2005 (though between you and me we know he doesn't need it)  ; Brian Cox as Agamemnon and Brendan Gleason as Menelao are first rate . The very brief presence of Julie Christie as Thetis is unforgettable. Pitt looks a little overacted ; it is absolutely true that no other actor in this moment was more appropiatte than him ; but in my opinion I missed the presence of the inner mood in certain moments of loneliness of Achilles .<br /><br />However the sumptuosity and the epic breathe are still present  all along the film.<br /><br />Orlando Bloom is fine as Paris . He embodies all the cowardness and lack of braveness , and Erik Bana was OK.<br /><br />But beware with Garret Hedlund as Patroclo ; there are certain twist of the real character of him and Hedlund gave a very romantic approach ; Kruger is a very beautiful woman but she looks extremely cool and geometric .<br /><br />The film experiments a visible decline since the Hector death and the Troy invassion . I reall do not know what was going on ; because these crucial moments are told so kinetically without any drop of dark poetry and the serenity of such tragical moment demanded . It seemed the producers would have considered this section of the story without relevance and the last sequences look like a fast account of the facts .<br /><br />Nevertheless it is a watchable and dazzling visual film .
6305807930|4.0|After seeing Dario Argento's \\"Inferno,\\" I have moved into the final phases of seeing his entire body of work. It was easy to claim ignorance of many of this Italian director's films until a few years ago because it was difficult to find them anywhere, let alone in an uncut form. Fortunately, DVD arrived on the scene and eager film fans with dollars to spend inspired numerous companies to start churning out any movie they could get their hands on. It wasn't too long before practically every Argento film arrived on store shelves, many of them in uncut, unrated formats. Unfortunately, most viewers have likely never heard of Dario Argento. These days more people know about the director's beautiful daughter Asia than the horror maestro himself. What a shame. Argento's films, at least the ones I have seen, are masterpieces of style injected with truly cringe inducing violence. For a brief period of time, Argento drifted away from the tried and true giallo format to indulge in what would become known as his \\"Three Mothers' Trilogy.\\" The first entry is \\"Suspiria,\\" the second \\"Inferno.\\" The third, unfortunately, has never arrived on the scene. After watching \\"Inferno,\\" I must say that I prefer his giallo films.<br /><br />That's not to say \\"Inferno\\" is a bad film--far from it. The movie introduces the viewer to a young woman living in a most mysterious house. According to a book she finds entitled \\"Three Mothers,\\" written by a long dead alchemist named E. Varelli, the building she currently resides in may well be one of the three structures the aforementioned alchemist built for these three mothers. Who are they? Mater Tenebrarum (the mother of darkness), Mater Suspiriorum (the mother of sighs), and Mater Lachrymarum (mother of tears) rule the world from their three abodes, effectively controlling the destinies of everyone on the planet. One of the houses sits in Freiburg, Germany, another in Rome, and the last in New York City. And wouldn't you know it? Rose (Irene Miracle), the young lady who found the book, definitely lives in an eerie building in the Big Apple. We learn most of this within the first ten minutes of the film. Unfortunately, these scenes form the only coherent segment of the movie. All bets are off after Rose learns she's probably living in the middle of an ancient, horrible evil. From this point forward, \\"Inferno\\" lurches from one nonsensical plot thread to another. Some of them are interesting, some of them aren't, and some fall somewhere in between.<br /><br />The movie suddenly shifts focus to Rose's brother Mark (Leigh McCloskey), a student studying music in Europe. He receives an odd letter from Rose describing her suspicions about the house, so he decides to leave immediately for New York in order to lend a helping hand. Before he goes, Mark witnesses a few bizarre scenes. For instance, while listening to a piece of music in a lecture hall, he sees a beautiful young woman a few rows down staring at him. Why? Who knows, but the credits identify this woman as one of the three mothers. Too, in a short subplot that really goes nowhere, one of Mark's acquaintances that saw the letter investigates the Varelli book much to her everlasting detriment. Anyway, Mark arrives in New York only to discover his sister is missing. He thus moves into the building determined to find out exactly what is going on. In the course of his investigations, he meets up with the oddball bookseller next door, a flighty neighbor (played by Daria Nicolodi), and a few of the other stern yet creepy tenants. Rose's brother soon makes an interesting discovery, alluded to in the Varelli book, that leads him smack dab into yet another confusing series of events involving an architect with a weird talking device implanted in his throat and the Mater herself.<br /><br />\\"Inferno\\" is probably the only film I haven't worried about spoiling when writing a review. In order to spoil a film for someone, you have to know what the movie is about. I have NO IDEA what Argento tried to do here. The film eschews any conventional narrative in favor of one highly stylistic scene after another. And \\"Inferno\\" delves into style in a way few horror films ever achieve. You need look no further than the underwater scene at the beginning of the movie, or the cartoonishly lit interiors of the Mater's lair, or the revelatory denouement to realize this picture revels in artistically structured set pieces and situations. The flair for color and setting eclipses more than the narrative: the actors, the performances, and even the famous Argento kills disappear into the background. Sure, a couple of the characters meet their end at the claws of cats and rats, and a few knifings show up to keep you on your toes, but the main reason to watch \\"Inferno\\" involves enjoying the scenery and trying not to ask too many pesky questions about motivation or plot development. The movie concerns witchcraft and alchemy, two massively confusing topics, so who are we to demand answers to such supremely complicated subjects?<br /><br />I liked the extras on the DVD. A nice behind the scenes documentary explains the technical difficulties behind the film. Apparently, tossing cats on Daria Nicolodi isn't as easy as it sounds, nor was the underwater scene a piece of cake. Probably the best thing about \\"Inferno\\" for this fan was the inclusion of a Keith Emerson soundtrack. As a huge Emerson, Lake, and Palmer aficionado, I instantly bonded with the organ/synthesizer score. Heck, a few of the songs would have fit in perfectly on a 1970's ELP album. All Argento completists will want to own \\"Inferno,\\" but newcomers to the man's work should probably fortify themselves with his better known (and just plain better) gialli work before diving in here.e NO IDEA what Argento tried to do here.

B00005NC66|5.0|For many viewers this film is the quintessential movie of the New Wave . I would not dare to affirm it but undoubtly we are in front a masterpiece loaded with irreverence , sardonic humor and a special candor and tenderness of the loneliness told in a brilliant journey of hyperkinetic anguish .<br /><br />The delirium and the sorrow ; the time must be lived as it was the last day of their lives . The story turns around the adventures and misadventures of a very weird couple who decides to break certain rules . Belmondo is outstanding .<br /><br />We had to wait until Jules and Jim to enjoy and describe the whole circle of the meaning of the New Wave .<br /><br />You may number five essential titles : 400 blows (Truffaut) (see my review) ; Breathless ; Les cousins (Chabrol); Bob le flambeur(Jean Pierre Melville) and Jules and Jim (Truffaut).<br /><br />Essential film .
0316666343|1.0|I have to agree with everyone else who has given this book 3 or less stars.  The beginning was very intriguing.  It held my interest and I had a desire to know what would become of Susie Salmon, her friends and family.  Then, as others have said, the story took a nose-dive.  The story kept going on and on and nothing was happening.  People were growing up and going on with their lives while the poor girl was just hangin' around.  Boooring.  I sure pray that that isn't what heaven is truly like.  (What I am about to comment on might give parts away, so if you haven't read the book yet, you should stop reading now)  The out of body experience was just....yuck.  It was totally from the movie Ghost and I cringed when it took place in the book as well as in the movie.  Why, if Ray knew it was Susie and not Ruth, did Susie not tell him what happened to her, who did it, where to find the evidence and where to find her body?  Why, instead, did she resort to only discuss having sex?  That doesn't seem pertinent to a 14-year-old's agenda.  Especially one who has been murdered.  It was not believable to me as a reader.  Also, what happened to Lindsay's evidence that she obtained from Mr. Harvey's house?  What was the purpose of that if they didn't find anything?  The mother coming back and everything ending up peaches and cream was also unbelievable.  Hard to fathom and certainly unrelatable to real life.  The parents split up for a reason and having a heart attack that fixes it seems very unlikely.   <br />     Overall disappointed and never likely to read it again or recommend it to others.
B0002MPU1K|5.0|I have been eagerly awaiting the release of this Peter Cincotti CD ever since hearing his self-titled debut CD and this follow-up CD is just absolutely outstanding!  It's an interesting and eclectic selection of tracks that should appeal to both jazz and pop fans alike.  Mr. Cincotti's singing is smooth and warm and he is a master at phrasing.  His artistry on jazz piano is some of the best I have ever heard with gorgeous chord structure and the unbelievable manner in which his fingers can fly over the keyboard.  <br /> <br />He gives each track his own individual treatment, ranging from the upbeat funky version of \\"St. Louis Blues\\" to the uplifting and rousing \\"Raise the Roof\\" which is just soooo cool.  Quite a unique spin on his sensuous \\"Bali Ha'i\\" from the original version with harmonica accompaniment.  He performs excellent renditions of a couple old favorites such as the sweet \\"Some Kind of wonderful\\"the smooth \\"I Love Paris\\", including a lovely offering of \\"You Don't Know Me\\" as a tribute to the late Ray Charles.  The CD also includes four of his own compositions, among them the hauntingly beautiful \\"He's Watching\\", the lovelorn \\"On The Moon\\" and the wistful \\"I'd Rather Be With You\\", all of which were sung with much tender emotion.  Then there's the erotic \\"The Girl For Me Tonight\\" with it's provocative lyrics.  The last track is a mind-boggling fast-paced instrumental of the old standard \\"Cherokee\\" which races along at breakneck speed as he works his magic on his piano.   <br /> <br />If you love jazz, and pop ballads that are superbly modern, yet evoke the crooning genre of yesteryear, this CD is for you.  You will not be disappointed.  I guarantee it.   <br /> <br />S.M.Sitler  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000000Y1H|5.0|I've had people at my house or driving in my car when brilliant corners starts to play.  Some people say, \\"anyone could do that, he's hitting all the wrong notes\\".  Ah... yes he is indeed hitting notes that only Thelonious can get away with.  He can make notes fit together like no other person can.  I love it!!!  When you hear Hendrix play you know it's him, when you hear Miles Davis you can tell, John Coltrane no doubt.  They could also hit the \\"wrong notes\\" and create magic.  Picasso?  Van Gough? Mozart?  <br /> <br />How can two people hear, see and feel completely different perceptions from the same thing?
B0002S947K|5.0|I heard about this CD from a review in 'Esquire' magazine. This CD is among the best I've ever heard. Ray brings up the emotions and feelings of Jeff Buckley's 'Grace'. There are song's on this album that are even better than those on 'Grace'(Shelter comes to mind). My personal fav tracks are 'Shelter', 'Jolene', and 'Trouble'.
6305841861|5.0|Before I get to my review, I just want to go on a little rant here: Some of you may have noticed this before, but 'Anchor Bay' has a habit of holding back on the special features. If you listen to the commentary, you'd hear the makers of ED2 talking about several deleted scenes that they were assuming would appear on this DVD, but they are nowhere to be found. Anchor Bay has done the same thing with Hellraiser 2 and the infamous \\"surgeon scene\\", so I'm beginning to think they have a problem with including deleted scenes. I don't know, I just get the feeling that they could have made this into a jam-packed, two-disc set, but held out for some reason. <br /> <br />I was never a huge fan of the first Evil Dead. It seemed a little bland and cheesy for my liking, but I do respect everyone involved and think they did the best they could have in a tough situation like that (anyone who's read Bruce Campbell's book will know just how difficult it was to make that movie). Evil Dead 2, however, is a whole different ballgame. Unlike the original, this sequel is able to successfully mix a blend of comedy into the equation, all while refraining from being too over-the-top or unbelievable. <br /> <br />\\"Evil Dead II: Dead By Dawn\\" begins with a quick recap of the first one to get viewers up to speed on how this whole thing started. It sounded like an okay idea at first, but most viewer's ended up being confused. For starters, the whole thing has been completely reshot and slightly altered (due to legal reasons, they weren't allowed to use footage from the original). Most people didn't know if this was supposed to be a remake or if Ash was stupid enough to go back to that house (the back of the box says something along the lines of \\"After surviving the last encounter, Ash returns to the house to raise the dead once again\\", which just created more confusion). This whole thing could have easily been avoided if they just narrated it like they would do in the next sequel, \\"Army of Darkness\\". <br /> <br />After the first seven minutes or so, we pick up directly where the last one left off. I don't want to give too much of the film away, but lets just say that ED2 includes many of the plot elements that the first one had. Basically, I think ED2 took what the first one did, and improved on it. As always, Bruce Campbell shines in the role of Ash. There's just something about him that makes his actions so entertaining. The rest of the cast isn't anything too special, but that's okay since most people know that the Evil Dead series is all about Ash anyway. <br /> <br />EXTRAS: I mentioned this breifly before, but as far as special editions go, this DVD doesn't have much. The menu is plain-looking and resembles those of other Anchor Bay DVDs like Hellraiser. The commentary is enjoyable and the (somewhat disappointing) \\"Making of\\" feature is a little interesting. They could have had more interviews with the cast, but I guess it does it's job in telling you about the make-up and various special effects that were used. <br /> <br />Overall, if you enjoy horror movies with a comedic twist, Evil Dead 2 is perfect for you.
B0000BWVCM|4.0|I was looking forward to X-Men 2 since I first watched the original X-men. X1 was an excellent movie because the studio, unsure of how well the film would be received financially, provided the producers with an unsubstantial budget. The result was that the writers had to eliminate a lot of the expensive action sequences and concentrate more on the story. The story, by the way, in case you missed it, was first rate. I'm sure lots of people would rather have had more action but if thats all you want then go rent Batman 3. <br />  <br />X2, unfortunately, didn't have the same budgetary constraints. The results? You guessed it. More action, less story. The saving grace of the weak and convoluted plot was that the main bad guy was played by Brain Cox who is nothing other than a brilliant actor who can hold his own very well in a film with Ian McKlennan and Patrick Stewart (as opposed to certain others).  <br />  <br />Despite the fact that the plot was uninteresting one can gain enjoyment simply by watching all the crazy spectacles going on around them. The CGI was amazing, better than X1, and the new character of Nightcrawler was maybe the best out of all of them. I have to say that the opening sequence was maybe the best action sequence in a superhero flick that I ever saw. The bad part about such a great opening is that the movie, including the action sequences, are a big let-down from there on. <br />  <br />If you want to watch great special fx and see cool costumes and a couple or 3 hot chicks then I would rent or buy X-men 2 if I was you. Just don't expect some great storyline that keeps you captivated. Oh yeah, I have to say there was an especially weak allegory when Iceman had to tell his parents he was a mutant. They were making it so it was like he was telling him he wasn't into girls and it was so transparent and stupid. It was like the writers were all happy with themselves for the racism parallel that they thought they would throw something else in there and it was weak. The movie kind of redeemed itself immediately afterward when whats his name who controls fire (but can't create it) takes out a whole mess of cops (although it was weak actually because a bunch of cops got scorched but lived unhurt except that they had some soot on their faces!). <br />  <br />Anyway, I feel that now is the time for me to end this review.  <br />  <br />Oh yeah, the dude's name was Pyro. Duh! <br />
B0000024JA|4.0|I pretty much gave up on what mainstream rap and hip hop have to offer. It's gotten so bad it isn't funny. What I miss in terms of the more extreme gangsta stuff is the dark jazzy grittiness so well displayed in 36 Chambers. Tical isn't the best solo album of the Wu, that would go to GZA's outstanding Liquid Swords, but it has memorable songs, great lyrics and a very dark feel. Thankfully, Release yo Delf is the only song that has female R n' B vocals(another reason why I don't like mainstream rap, too much R n' B influence). This one has been in regular rotation in my stereos since middle school.
B00005V3Z4|4.0|DD was a flick that i watched because it was available for something like 10 bucks and i read the synopsis and it seemed interesting so i bought it and i watched it and i liked it and so should you. <br />  <br />the story fascinated me because i am fascinated by the concepts of time travel and alternate realities and that is what this movie explores. in addition to those things the film delves deep into the minds and the lives of teenagers who have some problems dealing with society. it presented these teenagers in a relaistic way as opposed to most goofy teenage flicks that are totally unrelaistic. the interaction between brother and sister and child and parent is extremely realistic and i appreciate the seriousness and emotion that it took to write those scenes.  we need more of them. <br />  <br />i must also say that jena malone is hot but she looked younger than she really is in this movie. she needs to be in more films and, given her obvious talent, i am sure she will be. <br />  <br />i would recommend this movie to readers out there who happen to be reading this review that i wrote because, first of all, this is a very well made film especially considering that it was done by a first timer.  the vivid imagery is fairly mesemerizing and intrigues you to the point where you find yourself captivated with the imagery and then the characers and then the story.  it simply looks beautiful as hell. <br />  <br />the acting is alos excellent as jena and the rest do a fine job. jake is his usual self, which is good even though he seems to be the same in all his flicks but he is a perfect fit and plays Donnie well as hell. the parents are even good as is jakes/donnies sister - always good. <br />  <br />my only complaint is that i wished that it more fully explained the whole time travel aspect of the story but the way that the story was told left a lot to the imagination and that is a very good thing because it is fun to think and figure things out instead of being spoonfed everything by annoyingly pretentious hollywood directors. <br />  <br />by the way, jena malone does a very good job in this movie. <br />
B00005YW4H|5.0|....and I don't mean that in a bad way by any means. I love some chilled out relaxed loungy jazz that just pulls my soul out of my ears and sends me off to Never Never Land. This is what Nora does to me. Her soothing voice is among the best in years. Is she mind blowingly original? Hardly, but few these days are. However, she is a talented songwriter who knows what makes a good jazz number. <br /> <br />A lot of people are hailing Joss Stone as the new Nora Jones, but I don't see it. Joss's material is a lot poppier, and she feels the need to strike sexy/angry poses and wear designer clothes. Nora is the quintessential girl-next-door and way more down to earth, I think this makes her all the more sexier and endearing. <br /> <br />Croon it, girl.
B0000AI45P|4.0|people are just benginng to understand where Verlaine is coming from. this album is still as fresh as ever. it is full of super edgy guitar playing, and interesting lyrics. a total album listen without a real single kind of song, so radio never knew what to do with Television.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|Well its sad to see people like ALBERT MINDSVIT (see the cheese review) are so ignorant about a band like the Beatles.It's a shame he doesnt get it.The Beatles paved the way for alot of rock bands out there who therefore paved the way for more.So the Beatles started the rock star(band) phase we all know.John,Ringo,George and Paul's musical genuis talent put together the biggest franchise in music history next to Elvis.So anyways this #1 song set is a credit to their history.This would please any casual listener or hardcore fan.If you like some Beatles songs chances are they are on this cd.A good solid buy.I hope they release a part two to this cd,like the 2ND TO NONE for Elvis.....Hey Albert..try listening next time.
0446677450|2.0|When I first read this book, I was impressed, though it becomes fairly obvious, even from the first several pages, that Kiyosaki's \\"Rich Dad\\" is a fiction. There's nothing wrong in this. Using fables is I time honored method of communicating deeper truths. To pounce on Kiyosaki for creating this sort of fiction is to miss the point.  <br /> <br />However... <br /> <br />What concerns me is that Kiyosaki may be lying about his own path to wealth. I base this on a reivew of Kiyosaki's book by John T. Reed. Do a google search under Reed and Kiyosaki. Judge for yourself. Having read this review, it seems much more likely that Kiyosaki does not practice all that he preaches. He lies about his wealth, how he obtained it, and the nature of his success in general. This is the real sin. <br /> <br />My own belief is that Kiyosaki's true path to wealth is writing inspirational books and netork marketing techniques. This is a valid way to get rich. It's just too bad Kiyosaki (aka Rich Dad) doesn't tell you this. That, I suppose, would definitely hurt his passive income from the likes of us. <br /> <br />If you read this book, maintain some perspective. I don't regret reading it but I do resent the deception. The essential message can be summed up as follows: Your expenses should not exceed your income. This is the path to wealth. Period.
0060925000|5.0|This epic novel fully deserves all of the praise that it has received. My only regret is that I did not read it earlier. It is the story of Lata Mehra's search for a suitable husband - or rather her mother's search for an acceptable match. It is set against the back-cloth of post independence India and the political turmoil of the early 1950s. Some readers have found the length of the novel daunting at about 1500 pages. But it is so well written that each page can be savoured. I actually found myself reading more slowly than usual; such was the sheer pleasure of getting to know the beautifully crafted characters.  <br /> <br />The star of the show is certainly the manipulative but good intentioned mother Mrs Rupa Mehra - `You too will marry a boy of my choosing.' She is surely one of the great comic creations of modern literature as she will stop at nothing to ensure that she gets the son in law of her choice. And who will this be? The Lover? The Poet? Or the man with the very annoying shoes? Vikram Seth keeps us waiting until the very end before ending - or in my case extending - our agony!  <br /> <br />The political setting is fascinating and interesting. The Hindu/Muslim tension is sensitively portrayed. But it is the wonderful array of characters that I really loved. The eccentric and brilliant Chatterji's whose children communicate in couplets. The Politician and former Independence hero Mahesh Kapoor and his troublesome younger son. And so it goes on. <br /> <br />This is one of the best books I have ever read and I would recommend anybody to set aside the time. It is a joy not to be missed. <br /> <br />
B00005MNP8|4.0|Blondie's previous album, \\"Plastic Letters\\" showed them coming into a true form. Although all the ingredients for a smash were there, they were -- sometimes awkwardly -- mishmashed together. Blondie showed a penchant for brilliance within chaos, and with \\"Parallel Lines\\" the brilliance was allowed to shine through. Mike Chapman shellacked the CD with glossy production, creative hooks, and repeatedly attacks the listener with sheer brilliance. \\"Hanging On The Telephone\\" is Debbie Harry at her most ferocious; \\"Picture This\\" at her most vulnerable. For all it's thrilling, epic highs, however, one can't help but find fault. \\"Pretty Baby\\" and \\"I Know But I Don't Know\\" (which probably would have fared much better had they not been wedged between the broody \\"Fade Away And Radiate\\" and the accessible, riff-laden \\"11:59\\") seem to fall somewhat flat, and after their smash \\"Heart Of Glass,\\" the tracks seem to lack the resonance that the first three-quarters of the album was filled with. <br /> <br />Although it is wildly uneven, the first four tracks of \\"Parallel Lines\\" are alone worth nearly any price. This is Blondie in their most accessible form, with all the trademark classics. This is not an album to miss.
B000026FOA|5.0|...in the book of Nick Drake, \\"Five Leaves Left\\" is one of two fairly lush (by folk standards) records he committed to the listening public - such as it was, for him, at the time - before (as legend has it) mounting depression over his lack of commercial success played its role in the creation of the bare-bones guitar beauty \\"Pink Moon,\\" his final record before dying of an overdose of antidepressants in 1974 at age 26. <br /> <br />My first Drake record was \\"Pink Moon.\\" Within a few days, and about 35 listens, I'd rushed back to the store to liberate this record, \\"Bryter Later,\\" and the just-released \\"Made to Love Magic.\\" Such is the power of Drake's melancholy grip on the dynamics of wispy voice, intricate guitar, wrenching lyric and mood-perfect accompaniment. I'm still listening - I've heard every record numerous times - but the jury is no longer out in my mind: the world overlooked a genius here.  He seems unsettlingly aware of his own potential for such a fate in this record's second-to-last cut, \\"Fruit Tree.\\" He wasn't, one thinks, singing of himself, although he did that almost too well. But he might as well have been: \\"Safe in your place deep in the earth/That's when they'll know what you're truly worth.../They'll all know/That you were here when you're gone\\".  <br /> <br />\\"Five Leaves Left\\" has painful, hopeful, joyful (too few), and despairing bolts like this all through it. \\"Time Has Told Me,\\" the opener, celebrates a great love while already lamenting its future loss, Drake's and Richard Thompson's guitars weaving a poignant American country atmosphere: \\"Time has told me/Not to ask for more/For someday our ocean/will find its shore.\\" The second song, \\"River Man,\\" is apparently overproduced for many;  I found the background strings but a natural extension of the emotional strain Drake's voice always seems just too slight to hold. It's too easy to confuse his vocal treatments with lack of emotional commitment, I guess; it's the only way I can explain therare such accusation I've heard. I simply consider it the best voice at conveying soul-empty ache bound up with wonder that I ever heard on a record. At the end of \\"Cello Song,\\" he does an almost-perfect vocal duet with the title instrument, such that I at first couldn't tell one from the other. I could go on; you could read most of the rest of the day. I haven't come up with favorites yet. I thought I was about to, then every one I didn't get on first listen suddenly started striking home. Nick Drake is like that, at least he is when you didn't fall in love with the song on first listen. Which seems to happen less than half the time. Given that I'd consider this far from \\"easy\\" listening, that's nothing short of remarkable. His stuff draws you in; it seems to fit the mood. Play this record, wherever you are, and it will work to draw out the best - and the most beautifully painful - of wherever you are and whatever you are doing. I don't tear up often when listening to music. I am happy, really, to say that Nick is making this a rather common occurrence. The pain you hear in his records, you've felt many, many times. It just never had a soundtrack before. <br /> <br />You just have to hear it. You just have to hear this record, the next and last two he made - in short, all the Drake you can lay your hands on. (There's so little that your excuse just got eliminated.) I don't think anyone came closer to creating a complete record collection with so few albums. Nick Drake is that good. <br /> <br />
B00005MNP7|4.0|Parallel Lines was a slick, glossy listen. \\"Eat To The Beat\\" -- although still coasting on the explosion that was Parallel Lines -- outdoes it in one key factor: unpredictability. Although not as easy a listen as Parallel Lines, and it lacks the thrilling highs of its precursor (as well as well-known smash hits), Eat To The Beat is a worthy follow up. It's consistently jarring, and Blondie at it's most experimental. Their many influences swirl together on such songs as the reggae-tinged and darkly humorous \\"Die Young Stay Pretty\\"; techno and classic rock collide on the beat-heavy \\"Atomic.\\" \\"Slow Motion\\" is a worthy homage to Debbie Harry's girl-group doo-wop influences, and \\"Eat To The Beat\\" is a rollicking (if somewhat lyrically nonsensical) hodgepodge of styles, both vocally and musically. Debbie Harry proves drama is her forte on \\"Victor,\\" where she dramatically, wailingly dictates a letter. Jimmy Destri's lyrics on \\"Accidents Never Happen\\" are some of their career best, and the broody \\"Union City Blue\\" is broody Blondie at it's peak. The album only falters on the vacant \\"Sound-A-Sleep\\" and the strained \\"Shayla\\" -- a small price to pay for some of the amazing stuff here.
B000002OVJ|5.0|I never bought the original \\"Live at Leeds,\\" having for the Who the same sort of love/hate affair I have with the Beatles (this may be the result of being an unabashed Stones fanatic, I don't know). I'd look at the songs on it, go, wow, just six, and pass.    Boy am I glad I waited.    The remakes of records have a disturbing tendency to historical revisionism. Here's an exception. The biggest change history made to the original \\"Live at Leeds\\" was SIMPLY PUTTING THE BEST PARTS OF THE SHOW ON THE RECORD, FINALLY! Every one of my favorite numbers here isn't on the original record. I'd go so far as to say that if you own the original vinyl version, encase it in Lucite as a period piece. And BUY THIS ONE. It's worth the price for \\"Heaven and Hell\\" alone. The Who never rocked harder or tighter, live or in the studio, than on this number; Townshend's solo soars. He sounds more like Mick Taylor or Jimi Hendrix than like Pete Townshend! \\"Fortune Teller\\" is a metal-destructo take on the '50s chestnut covered in an entirely different (and equally good) fashion by the Rolling Stones. \\"Substitute\\" (a song which was on the original LP) sounds like a Led Zeppelin cover of a Who song. \\"A Quick One, While He's Away\\" is also on \\"The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus\\" disc; they do a similar version here. Less powerful and concise than the \\"Circus\\" version, it still may highlight all of the group's gifts better than any other single Who song. The harmony on \\"Tattoo\\" is heartbreaking. The \\"Tommy\\" excerpts rock out. Roger Daltrey is the frontman's frontman; his vocal presence is mighty, and he chips in (particularly before \\"Fortune Teller\\") to help out with Pete's mini-discography between-songs patter that's as fun to listen to as the songs. The sound quality will wow you. If this isn't Best Live Record Ever, it's top 5.    And....AND...you get the complete genesis of each track in an extremely well-written info booklet, one of the best liner-notes packets I've read.    I've never meant anything more. If you like The Who, you NEED \\"Live at Leeds.\\" No. THIS one.
B0002T7ZKW|2.0|Even if you don't like this single, I encourage you to get the American Idiot album; this single is unrepresentative of the album itself, which is undoubtedly one of the year's best albums to me. <br /> <br />The single, although fun, is too cookie-cutter for me. The same distorted riffs get played over and over, but I appreciate the lyrics and the message of the song; one highly appropriate for the times we live in. <br /> <br />I'd just wait for the American Idiot album. You can get it if you know where to look right now, but I'll be one of the first to buy it when it comes out in a week.
B0001ZMWQO|5.0|Franz Ferdinand is a wonderful band. They rank right up there with The Killers, Keane, and Scissor Sisters as far as \\"best new bands\\" go. I had the fortune of seeing them live (with The Killers and Scissor Sisters), and I must say that they sound just as good, if not better, on stage, which is an impressive feat in today's world. Their unreleased songs that they play live are just as good as the songs on the album. Kinda makes one wish that they waiting a bit longer to release it and made it 15 tracks. <br /> <br />Another thing: I see a lot of people saying they sound like a band from the 80s... and I can certainly see where these people are coming from, but does nobody hear the obvious influence of The Beatles? Almost every song has that Beatles ring to it. The lyrics are peppy and happy, very much like many Beatles songs... a lot of those 80s bands didn't have these lyrics. They do somewhat use early 80s guitar style and a small use of the keyboard, though. I'd have to classify them as Beatles-esque with a little bit of 80s sprinkled in to make it quite unique. Believe me, I love The Beatles, and I love 80s music, so this combination rocks my socks. An all around joy to listen to from track 1 to track 11. I highly reccommend it. Alternative rock is heading in a positive direction, and this band is one of the first few to get the ball rolling. Thanks to albums like this, the 2000s could very well turn out to be one of the greatest decades for rock music.
B00005V3Z4|3.0|I honestly don't get why this film has received the amount of attention it has.  I liked it but I certainly did not find it great.  It seems to have impressed a large number of viewers (and critics), so perhaps I'm just missing something.  I do like films that require me to think, but unfortunately the thought required to enjoy this film didn't feel rewarding in the end.  Other reviewers here have referred to this film as a puzzle.  That's the way it seemed to me, too; unfortunately after the puzzle is put together (and I believe that there is more than one way to interpret this film), one is left with a feeling of \\"so what?\\"  There isn't anything profound about this film; it doesn't shed any new light on \\"the human condition\\" as far as I can tell.  Perhaps this film appeals most to people who enjoy puzzles purely for the mental exercise.  I would like a little emotional payoff/insight in the end. <br /> <br />I read the most recent 50 or so reviews and did not see anyone comment on the age of the cast.  I must say that I was distracted by the casting of Jake Gyllenhaal as an alleged high school student.  Yes, he was only 20-21 when this was filmed, but he definitely looked to be in his twenties and not an adolescent.  Some of the other actors also looked too old to be playing their parts.  Jena Malone, on the other hand, whose looks match her age  (four years younger than Jake Gyllenhaal) only served to call attention to the fact that Jake Gyllenhaal looked more like a man and less like a teenager.  I thought Jake Gyllenhaal's performance was good (though I haven't seen him in anything else and some people are criticizing him by saying he essential comes across the same in every film), but he just wasn't believable as a high school student.  The casting wasn't as bad as, say, the film version of \\"The Wiz\\" (where a forties-ish Diana Ross tried to pretend to be a young teen), but I was definitely distracted by some of the choices made.
B0002OOUP0|5.0|Compared to what they did in the sixties, everything the Rolling Stones did subsequently seems (at least to me) modest by comparison - yet, judged on its own merit, this collection of their later music is easily worth five stars. In fact, Brown sugar and Wild horses (the first two tracks here) were actually recorded in 1969 but not released at the time. The extensive liner notes are taken from an interview with Mick Jagger and Keith Richards.<br /><br />Although less successful than their sixties music, they continued to have plenty of hits. They didn't reach number one in the UK but they had two American number ones - Angie and Miss you. In the UK, Brown sugar, Tumbling dice, Angie, It's only rock'n'roll but I like it, Fool to cry, Miss you, Emotional rescue and Start me up all made the top ten, while Undercover of the night and a cover of Harlem shuffle both came close. All those hits are here although there is one serious omission, Far away eyes - it was released as the B-side of Miss you but the single was later credited as a double-A side. Although other hits from the seventies and eighties are missing, some were re-issues of sixties recordings while the rest are not essential except to dedicated Stones fans, who will buy the original albums anyway.<br /><br />My favorite tracks from this album are Tumbling dice (later covered by Linda Ronstadt on her classic album, Simple dreams), Miss you, Brown sugar and Wild horses.<br /><br />This compilation is (as I write this) the only compilation of Rolling Stones music covering the seventies and beyond that does not also cover the sixties. (Note that the double CD, Forty licks, covers their whole career.) As such, this is an ideal companion to a collection of their early work (in my case, the triple CD London years). --This text refers to the Audio CD edition
B00013RC9I|1.0|This album was a huge disappointment, from someone who has all of their previous works.  Realizing it's hard to top Moon Safari, 1000hz and Premier Symptomes were really excellent, and unique albums.  Talkie Walkie, however is a total \\"pop\\" sell-out album.  They completely lose the break-beat grooviness of all their previous albums, for basically pablum spoon fed, lameness.  Someone should have told them they cannot sing, for christ sakes!! BARF! <br /> <br />I'm still a die-hard Air fan however, and willingly buy any of their future albums, but am hoping I don't have to throw away any more money on crap like \\"Talkie Walkie\\" OMG!@!!!!@#$@#$ <br /> <br />
B00028HBKM|1.0|this movie is nothing more than two hours of the rodney king beatings except w/ jesus.
B0001UL7RY|1.0|well... what do i have to say... after listening to her songs, i must say that sweet little avril went pop star these days.... <br />from cool looking, great sounding punk star, she went to class c off beat pop tunes, looking like she just came from christina aguilera's hairstylist and wardrobe...  <br />she went from cool, colorful punkie clothes to girly pink and gothic black outfits wich make her look like an overgrown rat... <br />sorry for sounding so harsh on her but strike one, strike two, strike three, you're out Avril!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <br />pop is on it's way out, and so are you
B00006879E|5.0|I think \\"Songs About Jane\\" easily qualifies as one of the best albums of the year. Every song is quite accessible and addictive (notice all the airplay that \\"She Will Be Loved\\" is getting). Definately worth the buy. One of the few new artists out there that I really like.
B00004T9UF|5.0|Marshall Mathers Lp is one of Eminem's most notorious albums.  Most rappers only have a few good songs on an album...and you will find yourself skipping to the next track.  But with Eminem's albums, each and every song has its own distinctive beat and unique lyrics.   <br /> <br />Pop in this CD and the first song you'll hear is \\"Kill You.\\"  He seems to be pretty angry in this song as he raps about how he's going to kill bitches.  But it turns out at the end that he's just kidding the whole time: \\"Hahaha, I'm just playin' ladies. You know I love you.\\"  This guy is a comedian; his songs will make you happy.  Other amazing songs are \\"Stan\\", \\"The Way I Am,\\" and \\"The Real Slim Shady.\\" <br /> <br />This album has explicit content which includes profanity and racist remarks.   If you are offended by this type of music, listen to this album until you learn to like it.
B00004SZWD|5.0|I'm biased because Songs in the Key of Life was the first album I ever owned.  I practically wore the vinyl grooves down on all four sides of the two LPs.  <br /> <br />From upbeat \\"Sir Duke\\" to esctatic \\"Isn't She Lovely\\" to wounded and angry \\"Ordinary Pain\\" -- this album has songs that express a wide range of emotions and experiences in life.  \\"Village Ghetto Land\\" is trying to wake us up to see the injustices that go on all around us.  \\"Always\\" is a song about undying love.  This album has it all, from one of the great musical masters, at the peak of his creative powers.  What more could you want? <br />
0767840135|3.0|Personally, the only way I will ever see one of their performances is on TV.  There is no way I can pay the price of tickets for a live show.  Have you seen the prices lately!!  Anyway, I got lucky and found this at a sale and quite enjoyed it but thought that whoever edited this thing should be fired.  And then I found out that this is the best of their DVD's as far as editing goes!!  There were a few places in here where the dumb editor cuts to the audience.  Hey, I don't care what the audience is doing, ever, and especially not when something interesting is happening onstage!! Another time or two they got a close-up when you wanted to see it from afar because of what was going on like the rope scene.  It was pretty good until right at the end and then they zoomed way in.  You didn't even get the effect of all those guys tumbling down at the same time.  A few people have said you just have to experience them in person because there is no way to capture it all on disc.  But I don't think there is any excuse for a professional group to use such poor editing unless it is on purpose so you will go to a live show.  Really, kids at school edit better than this.  But with all that said, it was a pretty incredible show.
B00003CY0V|2.0|This movie is so bad.<br />However, I didn't really mind watching it once I turned off any and all critical thinking ability. The beginning is awesome, Travolta captures your attention immediately, they blow up a young girl and half of S.W.A.T. and theres a cool CGI 360 degrees of explosive goodness. And then... well, then you should turn it off.... or fast forward to the gratuitous shot of Halle Berry (...)then turn it off. Hugh Jackman was decent as the \\"brilliant hacker\\"- until he started hacking... and then the cheese factor overwhelmed me. The plot- if you could call it that- was so forced and choppy that it felt like they had taken clips from Speed, FaceOff, The Net, and every other FBI agent movie ever, put them in a hat, and picked scenes/story bits at random. I liked how Travolta's character was a smart villian. Finally, a bad guy with a brain! But the whole movie is given away in the first 5 minutes. And Berry's character comes across as a dumb (...)- not a manipulative genius.<br /><br />The whole thing was over the top, ridiculous, implausible, and frankly- silly.
B0002J4ZWS|1.0|Morgan Freeman ruins this movie with his horrible voice over and acting. If you want to see Morgan Freeman in a good role, see \\"Dreamcatcher\\". That is an epic film.
0790725657|1.0|What a horrible movie. It should have had a different title and not pretended to be based on a book, or at least have had a lead character that wasn't pretentious, spoiled and bratty.  <br />There was some serious overacting, and Sara just didn't look right for the part. I guess the people who made the movie didn't read the book.  <br />And there is one scene towards the end, where Sara is in her room and the girls play with the neighbour monkey- if you look at the locket as they hand it back to her, and then when Miss Minchin takes it, the photos are reversed. I guess the director thought we wouldn't notice but I was so bored by the movie I happened to see it.  <br />One of the worst movies I have ever seen, even for a children's one... <br /> <br />
B000005DQR|4.0|Usually, when I write a review, I don't write in typical fanboy fashion however, this piece of plastic has forced me to do so.    <br /> <br />I don't think there is anymore to be said about this album.  It is, without question, one of the best compact disks in the last 10 years.  If you are a fan of turntablism/Djing and hip-hop in general, you owe it to yourself to purchase this album.  Even if you aren't a fan of the genre, it belongs in your collection.
B000063DFQ|4.0|Iron Maiden's 4th Studio Album is great. My review title is refering to the fact that this is Maiden's easiest album to get into, despite the fact that it isn't perfect. It has some of Maiden's best songs in the form of the Trooper and Flight of Icarus. The opener, Where Eagles Dare, is awesome too. Basically, this has all the ingredients for a great Maiden record. Some of the album feels a little underdeveloped. Had these moments been given more consideration, then this album would have been a perfect record. Yet, as it stands, it's still great to listen to. Maiden needs to be listened through their albums; There is no way to really appreciate them with their individual songs. That being said, Piece of Mind is a really good album. Check it out, you may like it!
B000002WYT|5.0|Crash is an awesome album. Every song is good. Once you have heard it you will never take it out of your cd player. DMB brings together many different musical instruments including a saxophone and a violin. These two bring amazing sounds to every song. You will find yourself singing every tune. Boyd Tinsley's solo on the violin in number 41 is ridiculous. Tripping Billies and Two Step bring a lot to the album, they are two of my personal favorites. Both of these songs have great lyrics and the compilation of the violin and sax are awesome with the crazy drumming skills of Carter Beauford. This cd will bring you up whenever you are down.  I definitely recommend buying this cd you will not be unsatisfied.
B0002BO0US|5.0|There's no way this minor group - nearly broke, on the way to breaking up in 1967 and seemingly stuck in an artistic rut - could have been expected to produce such a masterpiece. The songwriting, the harmonies, the performances are exquisite. This album caught more of that evocative summer than anything outside of Sgt. Pepper. Not one clinker in the bunch. There's a reason why this album was ranked #82 in the Rolling Stone Top 500 albums of all time and why some music giants today consider this album one of the most influential ever. This reissue is as low-fi as the original recording. You can almost hear the scratches from a cheap turntable. Enjoy!
B000021Y7X|5.0|You can't say enough good things about Stop Making Sense.<br /><br />It is simply the best band film in existence.
B00005JMEW|5.0|This is the heart-pounding first installment of one of the best action movies ever made. Everything works in this movie: the soundtrack, choreography, casting, dialogue, sets, locations, costuming--everything. Rent both volumes and watch them back-to-back for the best experience.
B00003CXCT|3.0|I own both the widescreen originals (in the box set) and the widescreen special editions and just watched them back to back to compare them. Everybody comments on Greedo shooting first (which IS horrible), but what about the terrible CGI of Jabba (in IV), or Luke's \\"scream\\" in V (when he's going down the chute), the BORING shots of Mos Eisley (IV), the omission of the original Ewok song (VI). We all grew up with the classic trilogy, and i think it's a BIG mistake not to issue them on DVD. Lucas would definately make some great extra cash by releasing these. I for one will NOT buy these \\"special editions\\", as long as my VHS tapes survive, which they still have for years.
B0002IQHY8|1.0|I bought the very first Alan Parsons Project albums in the 1970's and enjoyed them immediately. After that, the quality kind of went up & down but they were still pretty good...up until now.<br /><br />This CD sounds like those cheap techno dance remixes that were the big thing in the 80's. If this is a progressive step, it's backwards to something that has already been done ad nauseum. If this is Alan Parsons attempt to capitalize on the Britney Spears generation of computerized pablum, then he's succeeded.<br /><br />As for us older fans who have been with him since day one, this is barely recognizable of what we would expect from Alan Parsons. Try to listen to it before buying to avoid disappointment. It appears to be one of those CD's where you'll either love it or hate it depending on your tastes.
B00005QFE5|5.0|What a beautiful movie director Zhang Yimou had made! Very seldom a Chinese movie has touched me, moved me. But this movie had me in tears. The plot is so simple and I don't really care while I was watching it. The amazing cinematography, beautiful music, gorgeous Zhang Ziyi and her incredible performance grasped my attention. The story took place in a northern Chinese village during the time of the Culture Revolution. In this remote and poor village, most people and kids were illiterate. The villagers desperately needed a teacher to teach their kids. Therefore, when a teacher from a city finally came, he became the spotlight of the village. Everybody respected him or even worshipped him. The girl, Zhang Ziyi fell in love with him as soon as she first saw him. But since Chinese, especially a village girl were not used to expressing her feeling towards a man directly, she expressed them silently by making good dishes for him. The teacher knew it and loved her too. There was little conversation between the two lovers. There wasn't any physical contact between them either. But the viewer still feels the strong love between them. After the movie was over, the music, the beautiful winter scenery, and portrait of Zhang Ziyi stayed in my mind for a few days. It's the sweetest, yet saddest, movie I have seen in a long while.  Zhang Ziyi is a young and talented actress. This is her first movie. I think she did a wonderful job. Most Chinese actors/actresses graduate from a formal film school. They are trained to be actors/actresses in a school. Therefore, most of them do ACT in a movie, look very phony with their false acting. But Ziyi is so natural in this movie. She was not acting.
B00028HBKM|1.0|I don't see how this movie recieved so much praise other than for the fact that many people must've been blinded by their faith to the point that they would support anything pertaining to their god without viewing it first and foremost as art without a completely biased eye. This movie told no story and made no attempt to, it was simply an hours worth of beating the likes of which would've killed Jesus long before he made it to the cross. It seems as if this film was made for the sole purpose of evoking pity and guilt, rather than educating.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|if you like buffy and angel you'll love this. if you don't like buffy and angel you'll like this. eevryone will like this. the funniest thing i have ever seen, incredible plots, incredible characters and spaceships! even if you don't like sci-fi you'll like this (it actaully turned me into a sci-fi nerd) trust me. buy it, watch it, love it. then wonder why they cancelled it.

B00003CXCT|5.0|Living in Asia has it's privileges.  Store owners here do not care about street dates and put product on the shelves as soon as they get them.  Therefore, we often get DVD's about 1 to 2 weeks before they are available in North America.  We're talking Region 1 (North America)DVDs, not the Region 3 (Asia) ones.  (The Region 3 DVD was officially available today, September 17 at large stores such as HMV). Anyways, got the Star Wars Trilogy DVDs last week and finally watched them all including the supplement disc.  The picture and sound were superb.  I don't mind the special editions since they were done as per George Lucas' wishes.  Who are we to criticize what he does to HIS movies.  They are all minor changes to the background and add to the grandeur of his vision.  HOWEVER, there was one change that I did not like and it was only done to the DVD and not the theatrical release of the special editions.  In the final shot of Return of the Jedi when Obi Wan, Yoda and Anakin reappear, they replaced the guy playing Anakin with Hayden Christensen.  I thought that was sorta unnecessary (the other guy is still in the scene in the Death Star when Luke removes his mask).  I know it makes the contunuity with the first 3 films more coherent but it looks strange with this young guy standing with Alec Guinness and Yoda.  Other than that, the wait was worth it.   <br /> <br />I was also somewhat dissapointed with the short preview of Episode 3.  It dealt mainly with Hayden getting his own Darth Vader costume (yawn).  There is also a brief glimpse of E3 in the Lightsaber featurette.  Overall money well spent.  I know George Lucas doesn't need it but what they hey.
B00006D295|3.0|while i love this movie, there is one thing that i cant get over:  they butchered the soundtrack!!  upon the first viewing of my dvd (the single disc edition) i horrified to hear what they had done to the musical numbers.  the dialouge between the songs sounds fine but as soon as the singing begins you can tell they remixed the score (adding more instruments, changing parts, etc) and in some parts they redubbed the vocal track as well.  one part you can especially tell is during rockys lines of 'rose tint my world'.  of course it wasn't the actor singing the part in the original version either but in this new edition its even more obvious.  various characters voices fade in and out as well.  having extensivly listened to the original movie soundtrack and watching the old version several times i couldnt believe that they would mess such a worshipped movie as this.
B0002S947K|5.0|I bought Ray's CD this morning and I'm already completely taken with it.  I certainly hope that this is only the first of many, many releases from him !
B000002BBY|3.0|Honestly, if Oasis hadn't been hyped to the sky, and if it hadn't featured a lead singer with no singing talent but a big offensive mouth, its music wouldn't be judged quite as harshly as it has been.  Because the fact is, when guitarist/songwriter Noel Gallagher hits the mark, he really nails it. <br /> <br />I couldn't stand \\"Wonderwall\\" even before it became an ubiquitous hit single -- melodically weak, structurally unengaging with a flat chorus, it's one of the songs I dread from the '90s.  But the title track \\"Morning Glory\\" is a swaggering, energetic pop-rock tune with a great hook; \\"Champagne Supernova\\" builds to an unashamedly huge rock crescendo, and the chorus of \\"Don't Look Back in Anger\\" is just one of those classic rock melodies that makes you think somebody would have written it long ago. <br /> <br />I still can't stand Liam Gallagher, with his off-key voice, annoying cockney accent and complete lack of vocal resilience.  When your guitarist sings better than you (on \\"Don't Look Back in Anger\\"), I'd say you have a serious problem with your lead singer.  But again, the English music press heaped so much unwarranted, hyperbolic praise upon Oasis that a backlash was inevitable, and I was at least partially influenced by that.  Listening to (What's the Story) Morning Glory? almost 10 years after its release, with some distance, I can hear an album that's very uneven, but whose high points definitely warrant repeated listens.
B00003CXA3|1.0|I guess thats what happened, everything ive see from him sucks, the hunted was ok, but other then that i guess he ran out of ideas or something.  This movie is too short to tell a story, it feels incomplete, the performances are average at best(Gene as done better), the so called fast pace isnt there(its boring for an 1 hour and 40 minute which is way too short), there is one half decent sniper chase other then that there is some bad jokes, bad music, bad camera work, and a poor attempt at a story.  For some reason a women pushing a baby carrage gets shot during the only half decent scene of the movie which was basically 110% underplayed and he just walks away without so much as seeing if she is dead or not, i guess it was supposed to be shocking or gritty or dramatic but it felt like an afterthought.  Bad film making overall.  Like I said Willy must have used all his talent on the masterpiece known as The Exorcist, without a doubt his best movie.  Everything else he made feels like he just got lazy and didnt even try to make a good movie with any quality whatsoever.  Maybe if somebody would just tell him about caffiene, and give him a good script, we might see another movie that is actually somewhat entertaining.  1 out of a 10 for a half decent sniper chase, the ending is also bad because i thought he shot himself but after that it says he was fired or something like that, whatever.
B00004Z4SD|5.0|One of terms that was used in the editorial of this film was \\"quietly spiritual\\", which I think is a great description.  It's one of those rare films that, rather than telling you how you should perceive it, unfolds and lets you define your own meaning for it.  It portrays a man approaching the end of his life, trying to find meaning and tie up loose ends.   <br /> <br />This is a fantastic movie.  If you watch it (I highly recommend it), make sure that you either watch it by yourself or with someone who can appreciate a movie that makes you think.  I made the mistake of watching it with my simple-minded ex-wife who found it boring.  Watch it and enjoy.
B00000IQC8|5.0|I love this movie. It's hilarious, and exactly captures the feeling of the retail experience. A classic, I watch it every time I think I can't take my job any longer. It keeps me going.
6300268985|4.0|This was the very first \\"R\\" rated movie I snuck into. That was 29 years ago and I still remember how much I loved this flick! \\"Franz Liszt! Franz Liszt!\\" Okay, it's not accurate, it's over the top, it's in poor taste...but you know what? It's a Ken Russell movie for corn's sake! As a huge fan of Roger Daltrey AND Paul Nicholas, it was pure candy. The hair,the costumes, the excess, the sets; it's just wild and crazy. I still play my old vinyl soundtrack and imagine the scenes over and over in my mind. Love it or hate it, Lisztomania is an experience you'll never forget.
B00005RIKD|3.0|This isn't all in all a 'Proper' live album, as a majority of tracks have been thrown from their initial 5th gears down to 2nd, mostly due to the nature of September 11th, 2001 and is somewhat a tribure to those who died. That making it at the time one of the signifigant musical wound dressing of it;s time. That however doesn't hold up nearly 3 years later.  The energy of the songs ( obviously not the ballads ) have been sucked out making them blend into the walls to a point where you forget music is even playing. I HATE TO SAY THIS, but I have to wonder if this was a maketing scheme for some executive at A&M to cash in on tragedy. Just pouring through single B sides of live tracks would have made a better album than this. <br /> <br />Alot of cool live tracks and covers like 'Tempted' and 'Purple Haze' are out there, but only the real collector or someone who has extra money to spend has these. As these were only avalible on singles as B- Sides.  <br /> <br />If you're a true sting fan, then you will likely enjoy the slower renditions, but if you're a casual fan, the radio-friendly singles you're expecting will be missing and you're better off buying 'Fields of Gold' until a more 'Regular' live album is offered
B00005JLXE|1.0|This movie sucks!! All I have to say is the playground scene w/Elektra Natchios was reallly lame. \\"Let's take off our jackets at the same time, and then balance and fight on a teter-totter\\" man what a joke. The first time I heard the name Elektra Natchios I thought for sure they were saying electric nacho's. Anyway this is a peice, see Spider-man 1 or 2 if you want a good adaptation of a comic.
B00005MAM2|1.0|Although I love the Akira story and everything about it, the special edition changed many things about the original. for one thing, the character's voices are different! am i alone in the group that thinks that is a really stupid maneauver? I'm really pissed that they would do such a thing. I LIKED the way Koneda's voice sounds when he's yelling at Tetsuo. I liked how twisted Tetsuo's voice becomes throughout the film. I liked the sounds of everyone els'es voice in the movie. why in the hell did they change that??! stupid morons. The movie is great, but if you want the real feel of the movie, go back to the original version of the movie. it's much much much better.

0553296981|4.0|You will not walk into a library or any bookstore and not see this book. One day, I just decided to pick it up. It's about an ingenious young girl (Anne Frank of course) who manages to keep a diary named Kitty in which she narrates her life as she hides (in the \\"Secret Annexe\\") from the persecution of Jews by the Nazis. She narrates her life, hopes, and sorrows in this solitary hiding place. She articulates herself clearly, precociously. I have actually toyed around with the idea of keeping a \\"Kitty\\" for myself, but I couldn't bare the thought of someone coming across it and reading it.<br /><br />It is in this confinement that Anne matures and grows. She goes through puberty and becomes curious, like any other teenager would be. She writes about the people in the \\"Secret Annex\\" and how they relate to each other. Anne grows into a young, observant woman. She develops feelings for Peter, and describes how it is to be in love. Really, it's just beautiful.<br /><br />Another interesting feature about the diary is that although it was written during a tumultuous time in the history of Europe, it doesn't confine itself to Gestapo raids, Nazi cruelty, and Jewish suffering. It goes beyond that. It provides a complete human experience. I guess that's what I liked most about it. It's simple, but intelligently written. I continuously asked myself if any editing has been done during its translation or its publication. I was impressed by the lucidity of a girl barely into her teen years. It's an honest, meditative, reflective book.<br /><br />The epilogue was sad and haunting, but Anne Frank still lives in many ways. If you haven't read the book yet, by all means, do so.
B00005JN7O|4.0|It's hard to believe that basically everything other than the actors was CGI. The acting was pretty good from Jude Law and Gwyneth Paltrow, but Angelina Jolie was a joke. This is worth seeing on the BIG screen to take in the visual wonders.
B00028HBKC|5.0|I thought this movie did a wonderful illustration of what it was like for Jesus.  I felt it followed very true to what the Bible conveys.  It was explicit, but so was what Jesus had gone through.  If you whip a man, beat a man, and nail him to a cross there will be blood shed.  I always had a mental image in my mind, but this movie brings it to life.  It really makes you face the reality of it!
0783231032|2.0|If the book EASY RIDERS, RAGING BULLS is to be believed (a fun book to read about Hollywood in the 1970's), Steven Spielberg, despite making the colossal blockbusters JAWS and CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND, envied the success John Landis found with NATIONAL LAMPOON'S ANIMAL HOUSE.<br /><br />So much so that he made 1941.<br /><br />I was in high school when it came out and I can't tell you how much I looked forward to seeing it: Belushi, Aykroyd, John Candy, Spielberg and huge budget of special effects.  How could it NOT work?<br /><br />But it didn't.  I even went back to see it again, wondering if I'd just MISSED all the laughs.<br /><br />The first thing I noticed was that the timing was completely off.  The camera doesn't let go of anyone who screams.  The characters are all buffoons.  Like CADDYSHACK, the main characters are uninteresting but, unlike CADDYSHACK, the real comedians don't break out in their scenes.<br /><br />Maybe Rodney Dangerfield should have been General Stillwell.<br /><br />1941 has its moments.  Belushi has a great entrance.  Uber-dork Eddie Deezen's ventriloquist dummy spotting the Jap sub is funny.  Aykroyd donning pany hose and two oranges to declare, \\"I'm a bug!\\"<br /><br />Unfortunately, those moments are too few.  Most of the time, I wouldn't think, \\"That was funny.\\"  I thought, \\"Wow, that looked expensive.\\"<br /><br />But I have to agree with my college roommate from years ago: \\"A movie can't be all bad that ends with a house falling over a cliff.\\"
B0002IQHY8|5.0|I've been listening to this CD everyday for almost 2 weeks now. It is amazing. It is so much more than I was hoping for when I saw it, by accident, in the store. For those of you AP fans yearning for another Tales of Mystery & Imagination, forget about it. It's time to move on. And Alan Parsons has done exactly that. He has moved on to redefine progressive rock. And has done so by including a remake Nevermore which is like a personal thank you from him to all of us who have followed this music for almost 30 years. Who else can do that? No one I can think of, with the possible exception of Yes, or perhaps Peter Gabriel, but AP has released a collection of music which proves he is probably the worlds best sound producer, able to take you on real journeys of the imagination and quench your thirst for NEW PROGRESSIVE sounds. The addition of Chemical Brothers influence is unmistakably a stroke of genius and brings out the best of both artists. I am so happy that I bought this CD, just when I thought the chances of ever hearing truly moving music again had gone the way of the dinosaur, Alan Parsons has resurrected my passion for listening.
B0002T7ZKW|1.0|Why does Billie Joe constantly sing about cutting up women for the pleasure of torturing women?! That loser has nothing better to do! <br /> <br />\\"I don't wanna be an American Idiot, don't want a nation with my wife, so I'm gonna kill her, and she's going down to the anti graveyard.\\" very unamusing songs! Billie Joe is a loser!  <br /> <br />Check out Sugarcult or Good Charlotte, they don't sing about cutting up people and killing his kids and making his dog high.
B00004Z4WQ|3.0|Why did the makers of this movie feel the need to take all the potential for greatness that it had and make a sick movie (a much more accurate name)?  Although this movie is hysterical, the amount of nudity and sexual humor make the movie hard to watch.  While it's humor towers triumphantly over it's somewhat sister movie, Shriek if you Know What I Did Last Friday the Thirteenth, the content of the aforementioned movie makes it the better of the two.<br /><br />If you enjoy seeing the male anatamy before you in a perverted and disgusting manner, then this movie will be perfect for you.  If, like me, you'd much rather watch a movie that doesn't involve constant anatomical jokes, then skip this one.  The third is much better, anyway.
B00005JMCN|5.0|our entire family loved this movie.  it's a wonderful story about unexpected accomplishment in the face of adversity and if you love horses, it's a can't miss.  also it's based on actual events--a true story-- which makes it all the more enthralling.  jeff bridges and toby mcguire are excellent and you'll find yourself rooting for the little horse that could. we watch this film over and over and it never ceaes to entertain.
B00005JNEI|1.0|While I love the concept of the mock documentary, F-911 falls flat. It just doesn't compare to other mock documentaries such as Spinal Tap or The Blair Witch Project. <br /> <br />Spinal Tap was a genuinely funny movie, where as F-911's attempts at humor just come off as petty. And Blair Witch was considered very realistic and had many people believing it was a true story. <br /> <br />Of course, anyone with even minimal intelligence could see that F-911 was completely ficticious, and since then most 'points' made by Moore in his movie have been proven to be lies, doubletalk and baseless speculation. <br /> <br />If you want to see a good mock documentary, go see Tap or BWP.
B0000D96NW|4.0|Until recently, you couldn't have convinced me that I would ever listen to Machine Head again. The Burning Red was weak at best, and after listening to about half of Supercharger, I threw it out the window of my car at 85 mph (good thing I didn't pay for it...)  <br /> <br />Then a few months ago, a friend finally talked me into sitting down and listening to this. Next thing I knew, I was buying it.  <br /> <br />Don't get me wrong, this isn't metal's saviour, it's not the album of the year, and I still think MH can do (and has done) a lot better. But it's definitely a new start for the band. <br /> <br />The Good:  <br />- Imperium. Damn, they started this off with a bang. A serious wall of sound, thick guitars, Robb's voice actually sounds heavy again, clean vocals are right where they belong (few but powerful, and greatly accents the chorus).  <br />- Robb gave up that \\"Look at me, I can rap too... sorta...\\" nonsense that he tried on TBR and Supercharger. (Remember \\"From This Day\\"?? *vomit*) His vocal work has been better, but it's definitely been a LOT worse. <br />- Phil Demmel. Probably the best replacement for Logan that MH could have found (or will find).  <br />- As always with MH (even on the crap albums), solid drumming, even if it's nothing to jump up and down about. <br /> <br />The Bad: <br />- The production is a little weak. I can hardly hear Duce's bass, and Robb's lyrics are still a tad bit screechy... (his voice really hasn't been well produced since The More Things Change) <br />- Somewhat lame nu-metal/alternacrap lyrics, a good bit of crybaby stuff. The only reason it's not holding the album back further is that the delivery here is a lot more convincing than it was on, say, TBR (i.e. \\"The Blood, The Sweat, The Tears\\" or that one song where he just cusses out Logan for 4 minutes) <br /> <br />The Bottom Line:  <br />- This is a solid return, and I hope Machine Head stays the course on this one. Even though there's definitely room for improvement, this is their best effort in 7 years and it shows a lot of potential. <br /> <br />See you when the european tour comes to town.
B00005RFAI|4.0|The album I choose to review is Pink's Missundaztood. The reason I choose this album was because I like her music a lot. Her songs are really good. The words in her songs have a strong meaning in them and it represents who she is. That's one of the things I like about her music is that she writes about stuff that means something to her. Some of her songs represent what her life was like growing up.  <br /> <br />As you all know she sings pop, and that's the kind of music I like to listen to. And if you like pop music then you will love Pink's Missundaztood. My favorite songs on her CD are \\"Missundaztood,\\" \\"Don't Let Me Get Me,\\" \\"Just Like a Pill,\\" and \\"Get the Party Started,\\" are really good songs. And if you like any of these songs then you should go out and buy this CD.  <br />
B00009W8N2|4.0|I wish I'd have listened, way back when, as one of my high school friends went on and on about this new band from Sweden that no one knew about. I didn't, and it was 4 years later, with the release of My Arms, Your Hearse, that I got to know the wonder that is Opeth. Of course, I was immediately compelled to pursue the back-catalogue, and find this jewel in the rough. <br /> <br />First off, the disclaimer: This is not the best Opeth has to offer, and new fans may have a better time starting with Blackwater Park, or MAYH, as they are much more accessible and the production has drastically improved since this debut.  <br /> <br />Now with that out of the way, Orchid is still probably one of the strongest debut offerings of the 1990's (and this was while America was still stuck neck-deep in alternacrap vomit). <br /> <br />The music here is slick, well arranged, and very progressive. Two guitars interweave throughout the album in intricate melodies, with the occasional death or thrash riff that will have any strong metal fans banging heads profusely. The bass is actually clear and strong in many places, a rare concept for a lot of heavier metal bands, and actually has a part in many of the melodies. And of course, the drumming is top notch, even if the double-bass tends to find its way into places it might have been better off left out of. <br /> <br />Mikael's clean vocals are convincing and clear, while his growls (and sometimes utterly chilling shrieks) give the music a definite mood and tone. The only real problem here is that the production was somewhat limiting on the total effect (this would improve greatly in later albums) <br /> <br />The good: <br />- Forest of October. Just listen to it already. <br />- Parts with dual lead guitar. This sort of tandem is a rarity (especially in metal) and finding bands who do it this well is nearly unheard of. <br />- Silhouette. Wonderful piano piece, and they really haven't done anything like this since. <br /> <br />Thebad: <br />- Nothing, but there are some things that needed improvement (hey, it's a debut after all). The songs were somewhat unstructured, and in places seem to ramble (Twilight Is My Robe, In Mist She Was Standing) and the overall production of Orchid did diminish the quality of the album a bit.  <br /> <br />Grab this, but get BWP or MAYH first.
B000089HCR|5.0|You have to pretend it is 1984 when you listen to this. Compared to ratt, bon jovi, even motley at this time WASP blew them away. Especially this cd. Great videos, outfits lots of controversey they had it all. Perefectly matched with tongue in cheek. Get this cd if you get any wasp at all.
B0002234LS|5.0|Back in 1990 Stephen King wrote a fairly forgettable short story in his \\"Four Past Midnight\\" collection (more widely known for the story 'The Langoliers') called \\"Secret Window, Secret Garden.\\"  Fourteen years later it comes to sighing, whispering life on the screen, portrayed with excellent acting and a very clean script.<br /><br />Johnny Depp has morphed into a truly great actor, talented and versatile, and he brings Mort Rainey's quirky writer's personality into a fully fleshed out character.  Notable also are Timothy Hutton's role as Ted Milner (remember 1981's Taps?), Maria Bello as Amy Rainey, and John TurTurro as John Shooter.  The movie is well filmed, well acted, and (I hate to say it) well directed.<br /><br />Mort Rainey is a writer going through a rather unfriendly divorce from his wife of ten years, Amy.  Alone and bitter in his cabin, he continues to work on his writing when John Shooter shows up on his doorstep, claiming Rainey stole his story.<br /><br />Mort says he can prove the story belongs to him and not Shooter, but while Mort digs around for the magazine which published the story in question years ago, things begin to happen around Shooter.  Mort's dog dies, people begin to die, and his divorce proceedings with Amy continue to get uglier.<br /><br />It seems that Shooter has Mort over a barrel, but perhaps Mort has his own ideas on how to resolve all the problems that plague him lately.<br /><br />Not fast paced or even remarkably cunning in its twists, this is still a very powerful movie with some finger-chewing intensity and even a few chuckles along the way.  Enjoy!

0345349571|5.0|A wonderful bit of historical writing.  I am a big Tuchman fan but must admit that her ability to get \\"history acedemics\\" all in a snit, adds to my delight in her work.  I have always felt that the common, everyday sort of guy, like myself, can glean much more from the so called \\"popular history writers\\" than they can from a stack of a thousand PhD rantings which end up filed away in a forgotten cabinet in must university storage room.  I highly recommend this one.
B0001LJC2K|5.0|'Absolution' is Defiantly the most energized album of the three.  If you like their previous work, skip the review and BUY ABSOLUTION NOW!  If you are a newbie out exploring, the single, 'Time Is Running Out' is pretty hooky (with a dirty electronic bass intro).  I'm glad MUSE is finally being played on our myopic radio waves.  However, pay special attention to 'Butterflies and Hurricanes' & 'Stockholm Syndrome'.  These two tracks need to be broken in over a few runs, but will prove they get the blood pumping.  With a complete adrenaline rush (Goosebumps and all) I could think of no other current songs to listen to for \\"motivational inspiration\\".  I had the chance to see MUSE in their first US tour, I regret passing the opportunity.  With Travis, Wilco, Sigur Rs and Radiohead out of the way, MUSE may be my swan song to concerts. Should they come around again, I'm so there.  Good Luck!  Buy the album, then Showbiz then Origin Of Symmetry.  Kato out.
B000066C1N|5.0|i absolutely love it.  i especially loved the orchestra music in \\"run free\\" and \\"rain\\".  good driving songs.  i didn't think bryan could top \\"everything i do, i do it for you\\" from the robin hood prince of thieves soundtrack.  i was wrong.  the words and music to \\"i will always return\\" moved me.  it's why i love bryan.  his love songs takes you away.  \\"sound the bugle\\" was a moving song too.  his lyrics and unique voice allows a few moments of escape. he is truly gifted.   i also loved the movie.
B00003CXCT|5.0|From a recent Associated Press interview with the man himself, George Lucas: <br /> <br />AP: Why did you rework the original trilogy into the special-edition versions in the late 1990s?  <br /> <br />Lucas: To me, the special edition ones are the films I wanted to make. Anybody that makes films knows the film is never finished. It's abandoned or it's ripped out of your hands, and it's thrown into the marketplace, never finished. It's a very rare experience where you find a filmmaker who says, \\"That's exactly what I wanted. I got everything I needed. I made it just perfect. I'm going to put it out there.\\" And even most artists, most painters, even composers would want to come back and redo their work now. They've got a new perspective on it, they've got more resources, they have better technology, and they can fix or finish the things that were never done. ... I wanted to actually finish the film the way it was meant to be when I was originally doing it. At the beginning, people went, \\"Don't you like it?\\" I said, \\"Well, the film only came out to be 25 or 30 percent of what I wanted it to be.\\" They said, \\"What are you talking about?\\" So finally, I stopped saying that, but if you read any interviews for about an eight- or nine-year period there, it was all about how disappointed I was and how unhappy I was and what a dismal experience it was. You know, it's too bad you need to get kind of half a job done and never get to finish it. So this was my chance to finish it.  <br /> <br />AP: Why not release both the originals and special editions on DVD?  <br /> <br />Lucas: The special edition, that's the one I wanted out there. The other movie, it's on VHS, if anybody wants it. ... I'm not going to spend the, we're talking millions of dollars here, the money and the time to refurbish that, because to me, it doesn't really exist anymore. It's like this is the movie I wanted it to be, and I'm sorry you saw half a completed film and fell in love with it. But I want it to be the way I want it to be. I'm the one who has to take responsibility for it. I'm the one who has to have everybody throw rocks at me all the time, so at least if they're going to throw rocks at me, they're going to throw rocks at me for something I love rather than something I think is not very good, or at least something I think is not finished.  <br /> <br />I think that just about sums it up.
B0002EXH40|4.0|While Youthanasia isnt considered by many as an influential album or a classic, it is still an important chapter in metal and music history. Megadeth had just released \\"Countdown to Extinction\\", their \\"Black Album\\" according to many. That album would be the peak of Megadeth's career. <br />So you would assume that Youthanasia would have signaled the beginning of a downward slope for the band. This is not the case. Youthanasia is just as good as, if not better than, \\"Countdown\\". While the track \\"A Tout le Monde\\" is a slower rock ballad, the rest of the album maintains Megadeth's raw, dirty, speed metal roots. The playing isnt as fast as it was in Megadeth's early years, but thats not necessarily a bad thing. If anything, the slowing down of the music helped Megadeth explore new grounds musically and they did so masterfully, as evident on this album. <br />I gave this album only 4 stars because I dont feel the remix was necessary. The album came out 10 years ago but there is very little improvement in sound quality. Remastering the band's first 5 albums was a good move, but by this point (1994)it seems that the recording quality was almost as good as today's. The extra tracks are nothing special in my opinion. The real magic of this album lies in tracks on the albums original release such as \\"Train of Consequences\\", \\"A Tout le Monde\\", and \\"Elysian Fields\\", among others. <br />If you dont already own a copy of Megadeth's Youthanasia, then I would strongly recommend picking up the remastered version. However, if you already own the original release then you arent missing much here. Certainly not another $15 worth. <br />
B0001YRVN4|5.0|This DVD release is going to kick ass.  It's star wars on dvd with deleted scenes and all sorts of extras whats not to like.  Thank you george lucas star wars forever.
B00004Z459|5.0|Linkin Park - Hybrid Theory <br /> <br />Back when downloading music through peer-to-peer programs wasn't exactly \\"illegal\\", my friend downloaded a couple of songs by this new band that called themselves \\"Linkin Park\\".  After hearing the songs \\"One Step Closer\\" and \\"A Place for My Head\\", I was hooked.  Once I heard their c.d. was coming out, I decided to run out and get it the day it came out. <br /> <br />Linkin Park is a band that really doesn't fit into one specific style of music.  The album title \\"Hybrid Theory\\" suits their style well.  They combine elements of metal, industrial and rap.  Some of the chords that they put into their songs have somewhat of  a gothic undertone to them.  Their songs deal with everyday occurrances such as stress, self-esteem, emotional pain and just not getting along with people. <br /> <br />One of the songs I enjoy on this c.d. is \\"One Step Closer\\".  This song was made for bad days when you just feel like telling people to shut up.  The album covers everything that one can feel inside day by day. <br /> <br />I recommend this c.d. to anyone who enjoys metal, industrial or rap.  I also recommend their other c.d.s, they do just as fine of a job as they have on this one.
B00003CXCT|5.0|I dont understand this, I saw the DVD TRILOGY ON SALE at my local movie store on September 14th!  HUH?  HOW CAN THIS BE?  Why are they allowed to do this and us loyal Amazon fans have to wait until the 21st?!<br /><br />Replys welcome.
B0002EXFNI|4.0|The film has a good first act, with some funny parts at the beginning but still nothing quite memorable. By act 2, the film's flow gets better and better as Kidman and Danielle's love expand to a major peak by the end of the act. However, its most definite redeemer was the final act, which not only truly shows Kidman's devotion for Danielle, but finishes the film off almost perfectly with a good mix of drama and humor.
B0002IVN9W|5.0|When I first heard Broken Social Scene's \\"You Forgot it in People\\", I didn't like it. It seemed disjointed and distant. What I failed to realize on the first listen was that was the charm of that album. I consider that album to be the best of 2003 if only because it took 6 months to fully appreciate it. <br /> <br />Along comes 2004 and some band called Arcade Fire. I was more prepared for this album than \\"You Forgot it in People\\", but it still hit me awkwardly. Some tunes were instantly connectable while others seemed like unpolished B-sides. But by the fourth or fifth trip around I realized this is an incredibly cohesive album, though not immediately evident. <br /> <br />All of the other reviewers are right on: it's emotional, it's passionate, it's affecting... there's a song for every mood. Put it on random and it's a new adventure every time. The music has a complexity to it that masks it's simplicity, if that makes sense. <br /> <br />The only real NMH influence I can see are the off-key vocals which instantly remind one of Jeff Mangum. But he's so sincere and passionate you instantly forgive him. It adds to the ambience of the album. <br /> <br />If indie music is your thing, or you like Broken Social Scene, The Fiery Furnaces, even Radiohead or Grandaddy, this is worth looking into. Amazon has posted a nice selection of long sound bytes for every song on the album.
B000286S8S|5.0|I was so stoked when I heard Van Halen was getting back together with Sammy Hagar. I prefer David Lee but we all no that will never happen. Then I heard they were going on tour and I was....well I was stoked! Then I heard they had a new best of comming out that was really the best of Van Halen.<br /><br />This collection has all the best from Van Halen, it really does have the best of both worlds, Sam and Dave are both here. From David Lee Roth you get classics such as 'Aint Talkin Bout Love' 'Hot For Teacher' 'Unchained' 'Everbody Wants Some' and a whole butt load more! From Sammy You get 'Dreams' 'Finish What Ya Started' 'Right Now' 'Black And Blue' and  a whole bunch more. You also get the worlds greatest instrumental and not to mention one of the greatest guitar solos of all time 'Eruption'<br /><br />On this collection you also get three new songs from Van Halen. All with Sammy 'Up For Breakfest' is a fun and crazy song but nothing to special. 'Learning To See' is much more searous and its a little better but still nothing special, but then there is 'Its About Time' which is a killer rock and roll song that will rock your socks off! And the title is ironic.<br /><br />This is a killer collection that every guitar player, musician, oh and Van Halen fan should have in their collection!
B00005JNEI|1.0|9/11 is not even mediocre fiction. Moore is nothing but a bitter fat kid looking to strike back for being consistently chosen last in gym class. As an individual, wholly lacking in talent,integrity,and substance, he has succeeded, at one level,in demonstrating that America is truly the land of opportunity. Where else would a charlatan, creating his own version of reality, meet with such astonishing success?  Simply put, he is a creative, unscrupulous,liar, with a curiously gullible following.
B00005JMX6|2.0|This movie had such potential,  and unfortunately it didn't even come close to reaching the outer fringes of it.   <br /> <br />Not funny,  at any point. I didn't even crack a smile, actually I never even smirked.  I was expecting so much more.   <br /> <br />One positive...great soundtrack.  Otherwise this movie is a complete throw-away!
0446310786|5.0|This book has left a mark in my head that I can't seem to get rid of. I read it as part of a class (it was a requirement) and I remember thinking \\"This better not be about a bird 'cause otherwise I'm gonna get bored reading it.\\"...It wasn't... <br />Instead I found a story of a little girl struggling with her thoughts, living with her father and little brother in a town were everything seemed big, but people were small minded. The fact that the way she grew up kept her grounded, I couldn't help but wonder how it would be like to be in her shoes for more that a minute. Growing up around boys myself I related to her and the way she thought. I remember thinking how innocent I used to be because I shared some of her thoughts when I was her age and even thought there's a huge difference between how people lived their lives then and how they live their lives now, I can honestly say that innocence will never change...I love this book and every time I read it I'm reminded of that...
0780020693|5.0|I remember (Amacord), is as fantasy memoir and an outrageously good piece of town comedy that still hasn't been topped. Imagine, if you will, the nuttiest town in Italy, set during the 1930s, where the local masked biker appears every 30 minutes or so only to just rip his bike up and down the street and finally goes out of frame to reveal a hot temptress who is trying to chat up the local builders, the foreman of which is having trouble with rising fascism and his mentally imbalanced brother in law who has recently got himself stuck up a tree because he needs a woman while at the same time his son's hormonal change is starting to get on his nerves. In 118 minutes nowhere else have so many characters and so many plots been explored completely! It is no wonder why this picked up so many awards and Oscars.<br /><br />Basically the story revolves around Fellini's life as a boy in his hometown... however it s multilayered with many fantasy moments that are like twisted reality. You then get taken away in several directions, one involving school children and the other about the town's problem with sexual tension. It is all wonderfully comic stuff.<br /><br />The old Technicolor looks is simply gorgeous and the framing exceptional. The direction is like one big Italian personality x 100, with fights at dinner really flaring up to the point that mothers threaten to kill themselves - I will cut my throat with this butter knife! The humour is mostly dark, sexy or just plain insane. Also the movie takes place over the four seasons, so it nicely wraps up in the end to create an almost eternal view of life. It is a lovely trick that makes this film very memorable.<br /><br />At times Amacord suffers simply from too much going on, but in many ways that is why we watch it again and again and we always find something that we missed before. This is two hours of sheer hysterics and some dazzling cinema to boot. Do not pass up on this just because it is a foreign film. It has accolade for good reason - you will simply not find a better town comedy, that looks so good, anywhere else.<br /><br />- As a note this is not really for children, even though Italian children have seen it on Sunday afternoon television, as it features a sizeable amount of sexual comic references and some topless smut near the end. Note the R rating.colade for good reason - you will simply not find a better town comedy, that looks so good, anywhere else. <br /> <br />- As a note this is not really for children, even though Italian children have seen it on Sunday afternoon television, as it features a sizeable amount of sexual comic references and some topless smut near the end.

B0001RVTXO|4.0|Not much to add to the other reviews, except to note that \\"Cecilia Ann\\", the best surf tune Dick Dale never wrote, is inexplicably missing from this collection.  It's on their other greatest hits package, Death to The Pixes, so it's a bit of a head scratcher why it isn't included here.  They could have easily dropped \\"Nimrod's Son\\" and added Cecelia instead.  Otherwise a good introduction to a very good band.  I just discovered them a few months ago and am glad I did.  If you like this album, check out their two best works: \\"Doolittle\\" and \\"Bossanova\\", on which you can find Cecilia Ann.
B000021XS0|5.0|Increadible! An album doesn't get any better than this. As a whole, there is nothing better in existance, I'm sure! This album is a play, set to increadible music deriving from all the great music from the 60s, 70s and 80s. You can feel the input from the past generations of music put into the solos and incorperation of music with vocals. The lyrics were written by many members of the band, and tells a story of a man, and why he descided to commit suicide, then his life (ehr -- whatever it is) after he dies. Great story, unmatchable mix of music, the only draw back is that it is only in it's best light listened the whole way through in one sitting (but is good no matter what)!
B00006690G|1.0|Me and KarlMarx agreeing on something?!!?!?!? =O It must be a dream! But it isn't: KarlMarx and I FINALLY agree on something. Rap sucks. Listen to KarlMarx! RATM and Slayer kick ass!! Feminem sucks! For additional good music listen to Lacuna Coil,  Hatebreed, Pig Destroyer, Mastodon, Sepultura, Soundgarden, TooL, Metallica (even the new album is better than this crap!), AC/DC, etc. I'm done here.
B00006AFUR|5.0|The great drive this album put out when you hear it is great. If you need some type of inspiration that you know you can get from a band that keeps you going, listen to 30 Seconds to Mars. This is one of the most balance rock bands ever. They keep a strong emphasis on lyrics and vocals while still having an insaciable musical backbone. They are in the makings of another album which I will buy prompltly! I don't know if I will ever get tired of this album. After doing some research, this band has a larger fan base than many other \\"popular\\" bands, but still does not seem to have a radio spot. Their music has been in a few movies such as \\"The Core\\". Their live performances are always very apreciated. But best of all, they arean't a band that feeds everything to their fans. From their indirect lyrics and ingenius symbolism on their album, website, and in their lyrics that like to make their listeners figure out things. This is my absolute favorite straight-up rock band I have ever heard! Favorite song: \\"Edge of the Earth\\", \\"Echelon\\", \\"93 Million Miles\\" but really, they are all awesome songs!
B000021YQV|5.0|This is my second favorite SOAD album. It kicks ass! Here's a song rating:<br /><br />1. Prison Song 5/5<br /><br />2. Needles 5/5<br /><br />3. Deer Dance 5/5<br /><br />4.

B00005UEAR|5.0|An increadible acheivement for the music world. A two CD set of over two hours of music. This album seems to take place after Scenes From a Memory since it litterally picks up where the other left off. It appears to be a continuing story as what goes on in the character's head after the series of events from the previous album stops. CD 1 is a flowing series of songs broken into \\"scenes\\", with great lyrical content and thought provoking ideas. CD 2 is scene 6. This one song is over an hour long. It has obvious mood changes and contrasting rythms and chords that never make it boring. If you have an hour+ to sit down and listen to a song, this is the song I would recomend. The increadible music mastry of the band is shown in this album and reading some articles on the internet made it seem that they did the whole sixth scene in one take with no editing -- which is hard to believe, but from this band I can believe it.

B00008OLYN|5.0|Despite the 'loud' sound of the album's name, this is one of Opeth's softest, slowest albums. I like the singer's meloncoly vocals put over powerful orchestol and rock music. There is nothing bad about this album, that's what makes it so good. There is no harsh vocals, no growling what so ever, I really like that from a band that always growls. This is a good break away for them, and it complements them greatly.
B000002KCI|5.0|Without any possible question, this is one of Neil Young's greatest albums, and given the extraordinary length of his career and the amazing number of albums that he has made, that is saying something.  This is also one of his most influential albums, producing a pattern for a host of guitar oriented garage and alternative bands in the 1980s and 1990s.  It is impossible to listen to a band like Thin White Rope or Eleventh Dream Day or Nirvana and escape the conclusion that the members of the bands all grew up listening to the cuts on this disc.<br /><br />Although this is widely known as one of the seminal guitar albums in the history of rock, there are two paradoxes in that claim.  First, a couple of the songs are entirely acoustic and feature none of the grungy guitar found throughout the rest of the disc.  \\"Pardon My Heart\\" is not merely acoustic, but soft and gentle as well.  \\"Through My Sails\\" is a Crosby, Stills, Nash, and Young song.  For me, it is the weakest cut on the album, and a potent reminder to me of why I prefer Neil Young on his own.  The second paradox is that in many ways Neil Young really isn't a very good guitarist.  Technically, there are probably a host of high school guitarists that surpass him.  His solos are some of the most elementary in the history of rock.  Nonetheless, Young seems to get more musical mileage out of relatively meager chops of any guitarist in history.  He might not be a virtuoso, but in this album he virtually reinvents grunge guitar, and paved the way for a host of imitators.<br /><br />Guitar aside, what drives this amazing album is the great, great songs that line up one after another.  \\"Don't Cry No Tears\\" gives way for the even more stunning \\"Danger Bird.\\"  A couple of songs later we get one of my favorite Young songs, \\"Barstool Blues.\\"  \\"Stupid Girl\\" is not a work of misogyny like the Stones' \\"Under My Thumb,\\" but yet another excellent guitar driven song.  \\"Drive Back\\" is another great song that then gives away to the song that seems to define the entire album, the epic, majestic \\"Cortez the Killer,\\" in which Neil gets to sing about his recurring subject of the European exploitation of the New World.<br /><br />Neil Young has other albums nearly as good as this, and possibly a couple of others that are even better, like AFTER THE GOLD RUSH and TONIGHT'S THE NIGHT, but there isn't a single one of his discs that I have listened to as often or with as much pleasure.  This truly is a disc that ought to be in the library of every serious rock fan.to the song that seems to define the entire album, the epic, majestic \\"Cortez the Killer,\\" in which Neil gets to sing about his recurring subject of the European exploitation of the New World.   <br /> <br />Neil Young has other albums nearly as good as this, and possibly a couple of others that are even better, like AFTER THE GOLD RUSH and TONIGHT'S THE NIGHT, but there isn't a single one of his discs that I have listened to as often or with as much pleasure.

B00006RINF|5.0|A soft female vocallist put to a harder back-end musical arrangment makes a good combination. Despite their flowery graphics on the album cover, the combination of sounds they use are not so simple or serene. Vocally, the primary vocallist (a female) will often do duets with a much harder/harsher male voice which adds even more contrast to the music. It's great listening, and the more I hear it the more I like it, that's always a good thing when you are looking for a good album.
B0000669JL|1.0|Imagine a Beatles compilation that only includes songs like: Lady Madonna, hello good bye, Yesterday, obladi oblada, yellow submarine,octopus garden and let it be. <br />That what's Legend is for Bob Marley <br />He was dead when Legend came out and he would have hated it to. <br /> <br />The songs are just a bunch of his most pop and Radio friendly stuff, songs like 3 little birds, Could you be loved or no woman no cry means nothing for the real fun.  <br />In Lengend Marley is pictured as a pop artist, who sings mostly love songs, while in reality he had a strong politic and social ideology wich whoever produced this compilation make sure to buried it with songs like 3 little birds or could you be loved. <br /> <br />True Marley is on soul rebel, Rastman Vibartions, Catch a fire. <br />on songs like ambush in the night, running away or sun is shinning. <br />Don't bother with this album. <br />
B0001ZMWQO|5.0|Well I love this CD. It is one of the very few I listen to heavily. Here is my track by track analysis: <br /> <br />1. Jaqueline 9/10. I love the soft opening intro. The second part of the song is catchy too, but gets a bit repetitive by the end. <br /> <br />2. Tell her Tonight 8/10: One of the weaker songs IMO. I don't believe the main singer sings this song, and it shows. <br /> <br />3. Take me Out 10/10. Awesome catchy song I can't get enough of! <br /> <br />4. The Dark of the Matinee: 11/10. My favorite song! Fun to sing along with, dance to, and listen to. Be sure to check out the music video too, its on launch radio. <br /> <br />5. Auf Asche: 9/10. good song, not great, but again, I never skip it. <br /> <br />6. Cheating on her: 9/10 Catchy, fun, song, but they have better <br /> <br />7. This fire: 7/10. My least favorite song. The only one I generally skip <br /> <br />8: Darts of Pleasure 10/10. I love this song! The singer does really cool things with his voice. <br /> <br />9. Michael: 10/10. This song took a while to grow on me, but now I really like it. It has some crazy guitar work, and all in all is a very, well, frenetic song. The lyrics are hilarious (though they may offend some.) <br /> <br />10. Come on Home: 10/10. This is a great song. A little more subdued than others, but awesome just the same. <br /> <br />11. 40': 9/10. A good ending song. Doesn't make you think FF just threw it in there to end the album. A stand alone song in its own right. <br /> <br />So all in all, a great album. BUY IT NOW! ;)
B00005JMEW|1.0|In the voice of Comic Book Guy \\"WORST MOVIE EVER\\" can you really be blinded into thinking this is worth it's weight in Turds! Just because someone told its good doesn't make it so. This is Tarantino's tribute to martial arts and their long history of being made. It is nothing but a MOCKERY of a beautiful art-form. There are plenty of really good kung fu flicks out there, The Bride With White Hair, Zatuichi, New Legend of Shaolin, The Swordsman, to name a few of the more popular, readily available titles. My girlfriend loves and made me watch this junk, maybe it's the grrrl power thing with her I don't know, but Quentin if you read this I want my time and money back!
B00028HBKM|1.0|I felt an obligation to see this film.  The brutality and gore are too much.  Over 2 hrs of very little but gruesome closeups of a man being ripped open over and over is not a very satisfying film.  There's no underlying spirituality at all.  The message I felt Mel was preaching was that everyone should feel horribly guilty for Jesus having to die in such a barbaric way for our 'sins'.  I truly detested this film with a 'passion'. <br />Jesus deserves a better film.
B000002KIE|5.0|....So what? I mean its that good. The Sex Pistols are a lot like Nirvana, they make one to three great studio albums (one in this case) that revolutionize the entire music industry. The bands effect is only starting to begin though, its only been two years since wannabe punk poseurs like Good Charlotte and Simple Plan have tried really hard to sound like them, with Green Day being the only successful band. This is real punk, you know like the punk back in the late seventies and early eighties. The Sex Pistols may not have invented punk but they certainly were one of the best, I would rank them up with the Ramones. Its a shame that this was their only album though, I really dont think they needed Sid to go on, they just should have kept making awesome albums with a new bassist. I know Sid was talented but just look what happened to Metallica! They freakin' lost Cliff Burton, the most talented bassist to walk the Earth but they still went on! Maybe if the SP finished what they and the Ramones started then punk bands these days may actually be more talented! Anyway buy this album, now I will rate the greatest punk bands of all time.  <br />  *Note: Greatest means most influencial, not best music although that kind of applies here.* <br />  1: The Velvet Underground <br />  2: The Stooges <br />  3: MC5 (yes they are punk) <br />  4: The Sex Pistols <br />  5: Nirvana <br />  6: the Ramones <br />  7: The Clash <br />  8: NFOX <br />  9: Green Day <br />  10: The Pixies
B000286RNY|1.0|This is by far the worst movie i have ever seen.  I mean yeah it had a weak plot and u can obviously see the bad vs evil, but the jokes are extremely corny and the exaggeration is not even funny.  Please do yourself a favor and dont even bother renting this piece of junk. I kept watching in hopes just to see if the movie would improve with time and it just kept getting worst.  It was a complete waste of time.
B000002JS6|5.0|During the Bon Scott era a lot of things happened. First of all 'High Voltage', AC\DC's debut album, although not very successful it gave its fans a look into the future and in it they saw the downfall of disco and glam rockers and the rise of hard rock again. AC\DC's five other Scott era albums each got more publicity than the last with 'Highway to Hell' making the bands entrance into USA mainstream acceptence the album sold 3 million copies internationally and went gold in the USA. But only months after its release the band was given the most shattering of blows, somewhere in Australia while drunk in a hotel room Bon Scott threw up, but not all of his vomit made it out, he ended up choking on the rest (like so many other rock stars out there). Nobody knew if AC\DC was going to recover from that but then as things were looking grim to the band hope appeared. <br />  Brian Johnson, a former frontman for a band that I forgot the name of (sorry) was asked to join AC\DC as the new frontman. With Brian, Angus, Malcolm, Phil and Cliff were back on their feet and ready to go back to the studios. In the fall of 1980, one of the most important albums was released, the title of the album, made in tombstone letters was a silent solute to former frontman Bon Scott and proved that AC\DC was ready for mainstream acceptance, they had gone through enough.  <br />  The title track, a harrowing decent into guitar hard rock heaven (or hell if you prefer) was a reminder that this album, along with Van Halens self-titled debut was here to end disco and glam rockers of the seventies. This album saved hard rock, it had sold 6 million albums within its first year, 1 million in the USA and 5 million internationally. This album would go on to sell nearly 20 million (19 million to be exact) records in the 25 years after its release. Other great tracks on this album are 'Hells Bells' which in my opinion is the third best AC\DC song ever (only topped by 'Back in Black' and 'Dirty Deeds had Done Dirt Cheap') and 'Shoot to Thrill' which is a very interesting song with a great prechorus and chorus.... Hell all the songs are great, just buy this album. Buy this classic rock album.
B00028HBKM|3.0|There is another movie available only through GODISALONE.com that is a film that deals with the birth and death of Jesus without all of the gore and violence.  It's called GOD IS ALONE.  It is a myseterious art film that follows a sullen young man who encounters a Virgin Mary like character and her newborn baby.  Through a twisted turn of events, the baby is killed and it seems that the Devil is given free reign to do what he pleases after that.  But God has other plans.  Check it out, Chritians, non-Christians, Jews, anyone.  It's worth the watch and has a much better story than THE PASSION.
B000002UKS|5.0|Oddly enough I thought that Nirvana, the band that Dave Grohl drummed for from '91 - '94 was the greatest grunge\punk\alternative band of all time. When Dave decided to be a frontman I was a bit concerned since he was such a great drummer and I thought thats where he belonged. When Dave released the Foo Fighters self-titled debut album it went platinum even though Dave didn't have a band and the album was just made up of demos written by Dave during the Nirvana era. There is no question that Dave learned some things from grunge god Kurt Cobain, but in this album the student becomes the master. <br />  This album is much more powerful and melodic than Daves first, now he has a band! Dave Grohl has now decided to be lead vocalist and rythem guitarist with Pat Smear, a person who used to tour with Nirvana on lead guitar and some other great musicians on rhythem. A songs that really stands out is 'November Stars' which in my opinion is the albums best song, mainly because its a ballad! I've really never heard a ballad from an alternative band before. Dave is one of the most talented musicians ever, like Alice Cooper said before me, quote \\"Dave... What a drummer and then he puts down the drum sticks and decides to be lead singer\\" unquote, that alone makes him great. This is probably the second best Foo album next to 'Theres nothing left to lose'. Buy it if you like Nirvana, grunge, late eighties\early ninties music, alternative or just rock in general.
B000020617|5.0|This album could be their best. I'm debating between this and The Colour and the Shape. The album is strong all the way through and the songs have lots of variety. Some of the better songs in my opinion are Stacked Actors, Breakout, Learn to Fly, Aurora, and MIA. But really basically every song is better than average. Buy this, you won't be dissapointed.
B0000AI44Q|4.0|I was very wary of Greendale; Neil has finally recovered from the deaths of Kurt Cobain and David Briggs and has, as is his wont, returned to comfortable hippy territory regarding the power of love.  Ah well.  Besides the sappy environmental/love/family themes, though, the names he's chosen for the characters -- did I mention it's a rock opera? -- are bizarrely allegorical (Sun Green and Earth Brown are the really egregious two).  Warning bells rang.<br /><br />Now that I've listened to it several times, I can say that a lot of my fears were justified.  Most of it's very soft-headed; the paranoia isn't always convincing; and the lyrics get overheated reeeeeal easy.  But I've also been impressed by the album, too: the moral universe Young has created is fairly deep and nuanced; when once in a while he actually manages to hit his target of scorn, it's powerful; and, finally, there is a novelistic attention to detail that's missing from the rest of the Young catalog.  Also, the majority of the performances are musically very strong, even if most of the music is simplistic.  Since the defects will be glaringly apparent if you listen to the album, I'll just stick to pointing out its strengths (I realize it's less fun that way).<br /><br />The first strength is the lack of pretension.  Neil is mostly into his little universe for its capacity to surprise him; he hasn't thought everything out, and so his emotional investment is in the characters rather than the moral of the whole rotten thing.  This is a really good thing -- if it had to stand on plot alone, it would be dire (cf. Pete Townshend's Psychoderelict).  Instead, Young created an imaginary place and let it grow in his mind, and pulled the threads of the story out of the milieu he envisioned.  It has the capacity to be tiresome, certainly, but it's not so vauntingly insulting as the top-down concepts of the worst practitioners of the genre.<br /><br />The second strength is how interesting most of the characters are.  The major characters Young creates -- Jed, the militiaman; Grampa, Grandma, Earl, Sun (the daughter), Officer Carmichael and his wife -- all have severe deficiencies (well, except Sun) and virtues, and, other than Sun, they're not too stereotypical.  The character of the Devil, who's only mentioned indirectly by the characters but who is fully fleshed out between the liners and the live acoustic performance, is one of the best: funny, clever, and inescapably creepy.  And is it me, or is the friendly art gallery owner Lenore in league with him?!<br /><br />The third major strength is that, even in the overlong or softheaded songs, Neil is in good (if not top) form as a songwriter and recording artist.  \\"Sun Green\\", whose reduction to straightforward plot makes it seem ludicrous (girl protests crony capitalism, is aired by media, FBI shoot her cat(!!!), runs away with sweet (but ultimately fatally flawed?) environmentalist type), in execution is rather masterful.  Young has a special \\"megaphone\\" amplifier that he uses for Sun's protest vocals, and his delivery of the song's chorus through it (see title) is unforgettable.  Even \\"Be the Rain\\" has enough songwriting chops to make one who rejects the hippie underpinnings of the song appreciate it as an ode to youthful passion -- the song construction is damn good.<br /><br />So, yes, Greendale is a good album.  It's not nearly as good as its proponents say, but it's an improvement from 2001's Are You Passionate?.  (That isn't an insult coming from me; AYP is a damn decent little 6-track EP disguised as a crappy album).  For the sheer proficiency of \\"recording design\\" (production, instrumentation, arrangement, song construction), it's worth picking up.e.

B0000CAXID|5.0|All I can say is that this is just a great album. Considering that Dave Grohl made it all by himself makes it even better. The songs have so much variety from the classy song For All the Cows to loud songs like Weenie Beenie and Wattershed. Honestly, this isn't Foo Fighters at their best, but Dave Grohl was just experimenting and they were just starting to evolve. Seriously though, buy this.
B00003CXCT|1.0|I will not purchase this or anything else with George Lucas' name on it, until the Original Star Wars, not the pompus, sickening self-important exercise in revisionism that is the Special Edition, becomes available.<br /><br />I don't know about the rest of you, but I fell in love with Star Wars the first time I saw it, and I was not happy with the Special Edition, where Greedo fired first, there were Dewback lizards roaming everywhere, and the band at Jabba's palace were ludicrous renderings of CGI tech.<br /><br />Until Lucas gives me the original, he will never see another cent from me.<br /><br />And the hypocrite even has the gall to say that the 3 Stooges shouldn't be colorized? Lucas is a vile, self-serving sell out. I did not watch  Episodes 1 or 2, and I will not be watching 3.
B00008H2LB|2.0|Lyrics & melody really make this CD upscale-the group has the potential to explode onto the charts.  They can do that by losing the rap on all the tracks.  This noise abrades the otherwise very fine tunes.  \\"Breaking the Rules\\" demonstrates the really fine music Linkin can produce.
B000001EHS|5.0|I just heard Vault again last night!  It still rocks!  I still think that Def Leppard was ahead of their time as a heavy metal band and challenged bands like GNR and Bon Jovi for the top of the charts.  I liked how the album opens with those 4 songs, like Pour, Photograph, the dramatic Love Bites, and Let's GEt Rocked!  I still like Rocket and listen to that one a lot.  They kind of overdo it with the Hysteria songs, since that album had the most hits; could have had two more from Pyromania or Tonight from Adrenalize, but you can't please everyone.  The newer song When Love And Hate Collide is just as strong as the other ballads. They chose some nice quiet ballads here to balance out with the rockers. I like Have You Ever... a little more now than then. Foolin I still like and I like that they closed it on a where-it-all-started approach with Bringing on the Heartbreak.  This is full of energy for all of its 70 minutes and I still play it sometimes to this day to get a jolt to some dull days. The late Steve Clark's guitar leads are among the best in rock and his musical talents are well displayed on here.
B00003CXCT|5.0|I love the Star Wars movies. I have the old editon VHS and I cant wait till Tuesday to get the DVD. But I dont know what this Greedo and he shot frist thing is. Can someone please explain to me? Thanks for the time.
B000001FKY|5.0|I still like Def Leppard's album Hysteria.  It took me 12 months until August 1988 (long after its Aug. '87 release) to get it.  That album just kept scoring so many hits that I had to get it! It is still a solid rock album.  Pour Some Sugar on Me has that hip-hop edge to it, but still has that rock underbelly for it.  Hysteria has the smoothest rock bridges I've heard from a band.  Love Bites still sound soulful for a power ballad, as if they've ended bad relationships.  Gods of War's dramatic intro I still like.  Woman sounds like something from Pyromania but fits well for this album.  Armageddon It has some unbelievable rhythm to it. Rocket sounds quite good in its full length.  Many of the songs are over 5 minutes (5:46), (5:49), (5:41), (5:21), (6:34), (6:32), but they are all entertaining and keep you addicted for the whole time without you drifting away.  One other surprise is Run Riot, where it's fully charged with its fast pace, versus the commercial sheen of the other songs.  Easily one of Mutt Lange's best produced albums--he made the band show its true colors.  It's so over the top, big sounds and all, on this album, and that's why it's been a huge seller ever since! Although I mostly listen to R&B and rap albums and some pop stuff, I like rock bands too, and this album was in my collection and played just as much as Bobby Brown and others that were hot in the summer and fall of 1988. Undeniably solid rock at the band's highest point!

B00005JNEI|1.0|If you're a non-partisan - or you have a serious adult view of politics - you won't like it. If you already hate Bush, you'll love it for the cartoon it is.     The simple fact is, Moore has stated that he has an agenda with this film and it oozes out of every scene. From creative edits (like the senator who's response to Moore's question was left off, to make it appear that he had no answer) or the joke speech Bush gave that Moore presents as serious, to tons of curiously missing pieces of information (like Clinton's and the Dem's ties to Halliburton and the Carlisle Group, or the fact that it was the CIA and Richard Clark that flew the Bin Ladens out of the US and not Bush), it's all here (or not here, as the case may be) for the enjoyment of the extreme Leftist, partisan democrat.     One of the most disturbing segments is Moore's portrayal of a peaceful Iraq.. before we attacked. Moore ignores the fact that, according to Human rights organizations, literally tens of thousands of Iraqi's died every single year on average at the hands of Saddam Hussein. Does Moore actually expect us to believe that we're the bad guys?     This film is a good example of everything that is wrong with politics. Moore's extremism causes some conservatives to be extremists, and soon, they're all out of touch with the regular person. This film is a fantasy world for the political partisan conspiracy theorist. If thats you, you'll enjoy it.
B00003CXI1|4.0|When Harry Potter came to the big screen, I did NOT go to see it. I was of firm standing that it was kidd stuff. Then, a few weeks ago, the people on abc2 news had it on as a &amp;amp;quot;movie event&amp;amp;quot;. I figured since it was free, why not watch it?    Needless to say, I was realllyyy surprised. I sat, spellbound through ALL commercial breaks, so I would'ent miss any of the story.    I've never read a single book in the series, so I can say with out them, this movie still can stand on it's own.       P.S. John Williams' score is amazeing!!!!      P.S.S. Still, I will say that &amp;amp;quot;The Lord of the Rings&amp;amp;quot; are much better movies, and if you LIKE Harry Potter, You'll LOVE them.
B00003CXCT|5.0|There's not much to say, its Star Wars and in my opinion the best science fiction movie ever made.
0316776963|4.0|Few books can make me laugh out loud (WARNING: do NOT read this in the library's \\"Quiet Room\\"; you will not be able to hold it back and may burst at the seams), but this one succeeded. The only thing better than reading this book is listening to it on CD as Sedaris himself reads from the pages. His comical high pitched voice and impeccable sense of comedic timing works on so many levels, you gotta hear him deliver the lines himself. I would give the audio version 5 stars because it is funnier to hear it rather than read it but still this book delivers! Read it and laugh (...)!
068987474X|5.0|I bought it and read it the same day. It's great! So true and SO funny!  It's the advice that all women know and give to each other about every dating situation, but for some reason can't seem remember it when we need to.  This book is a great reminder.  And it's coming from a guy!  He takes all the (lame) excuses we come up with for a guy's poor behavior and reminds you that you deserve better.  I'm buying one for all of my friends!
B00003CXCT|5.0|Theres a select few that complain about the stupidest things on these 3 episodes.  Stop it! Do you know how crazy you sound?! It's not as if your gonna skip on purchasing them.   <br />Anyways, these DVDs will be the first time I get to experience the trilogy in \\"widescreen!\\"  =) <br />On top of that, it'll be in DVD quality, crystal clear sound and picture, better then ever! I honestly am looking forward to it.  Lets not forget the packaging and extras that come with it, just awesome. Semptember 21st seems to be taking forever to arrive.
B00005JN7O|5.0|<br />  This movie was one of the coolest movies I've seen in a long time. It has it's own original look & feel. Can't really compare it to many other movies out there. If they had modern special effects & surround sound theaters back in the 30's this is what the movies might've looked like. It was loud,action packed,had a really cool story & was fun from beginning to end! Most of the movies from 2004 got bashed by critics but even JoBlo.com & rottentomatoes.com have a lot of good reviews for this one! If you want an old fashioned good time at the movies this is the one you've been waiting for!  <br />
B0000027F3|5.0|If you like bands like In Flames, Children of Bodom or Soilwork, here is the band to thank for it all right here. Judas Priest are one of the greatest bands of our time. When everyone else thought that metal was Guns N' Roses, AC/DC, and all that garbage, this band was making music that bands 15 years later would be influnced by and would be shaping the face of metal today. I can't even begin to stress how brilliant this CD truly is. Songs like \\"Painkiller\\", \\"Hell Patrol\\", \\"Leather Rebels\\", and \\"Between the Hammer and the Anvil\\" are metal classics that you just can't listen to enough. The perfect melodic riffs, the brutal drumming, the ripping solos, the killer falsetto vocals done by none other than metal god, Rob Halford. I just saw this band live at Ozzfest and they blew away every band on the main stage with their performance. Even Slayer's live set dulled in comparison. If you are a fan of talented melodic metal and want to know where it all began, look no further than this CD right here. Don't let everyone tell you that Black Sabbath is responsible for everything that has happened in the metal genre because it's not true. These guys, and most of today's melodic death guitarists could rip Tony Ioami a new one.
B00005QK3W|5.0|This is a great album.  The songs aren't very deep, but are interesting anyway, if only for the complex insturmentations and variations within the songs.  The album opens with \\"Lonely Road,\\" where you hear Paul's bass faintly playing a rythm, then BANG - in come the electric guitars and the drums, and Paul:  \\"I tried to get over you, tried to find something new, but all I could ever do is fill my time with thoughts of you.\\"  Then we get \\"From a Lover to a Friend,\\" simple words, yet sweet.  \\"She's Given Up Talking\\" is certainly a departure from other McCartney standards.  Then the fun rocker \\"Driving Rain,\\" the nice, easy numbers \\"I Do\\" and \\"Tiny Bubble,\\" the latter ends with a violin solo, which vaguely reminds me of the Beatles' White Album.  \\"You're Loving Flame\\" is beautiful, \\"Rinse the Raindrops\\" is an absolutely brilliantly constructed song, with it's opening guitar riffs to Paul's desperate voice, repeating the verse again and again.  \\"Freedom\\" closes the album, and what a fun way to go out of an album so carfully and magically created.  This is pure genius.
B00003CXCT|5.0|How can any less than 5 stars be awarded for this epic adventure? <br /> <br />On DVD, with 4 hours' bonus material, it's a gotta-have!
B0001AP12G|5.0|The College Dropout is a great album. Chicago native Kanye West has been producing songs for numerous artists for a while now. He's produced for such artists as Jay-Z, Alicia Keys, Talib Kweli, and Fabulous. Now, he's decided to work on the other end of music, and his first product is excellent. Kanye has a style that sets him apart from other rappers. He is very clever with his rhymes. And, instead of trying to become a god like some other MCs, he is very down to earth and he raps about everyday life for the most part. My favorite songs on this album are \\"All Falls Down\\", \\"Slow Jamz\\", and \\"Jesus Walks\\". \\"All Falls Down\\" has a chorus that was originally done by Lauryn Hill. West tried to get Hill to do the song with him, but it fell through. This paved the way for the world to be introduced to another Chicago singer, Syleena Johnson. Johnson's singing and Kanye's rapping mesh perfectly together. \\"Slow Jamz\\" is an awesome tribute to soul music and it feature's Twista and Jamie Foxx. It gives props to Luther Vandross, New Edition, and some others. \\"Jesus Walks\\" is another catchy song that also has a good message. At one point in the song Kanye spits, \\"Sex, Lies, Videotape, but if I talk about God my record won't get played.\\" Overall, this is an awesome album that has no weaknesses. Every song is good and even the skits and interludes add to the album. If you don't have it yet, go get it. You won't be disappointed.
0812550706|5.0|I've (sadly) only read this book once.  But I was incredibly impressed, you really DO feel for the characters.  The story of three kids, all genusis it follows the youngest, Ender.  Ender lived with his parents and siblings, his older brother Peter and the second child Valentine.  Though all are still very young they act like adults, Ender being a third child is looked down on. <br />Aliens have attacked twice, each time getting harder to kill.  A third attack is expected soon and humanity desprately trains kids to fight the oncomming attack. <br />A happy medium between his voilent brother and sweet sister Ender is the one chosen to be trained for combat.  Throughout the book he is manipulated to do what the goverment wishes, he is soon the top kid in his class, but always forced to be alone.  He struggles with his voilent side and is obesessed with a role play game on his computer. <br /> <br />I found it aa really good book, the writer is a genius, and impending doom stories always capture my attention. <br /> <br />If you like this book and dont mind watching a bit of a weird show, watch Neon Genisis Evangelion, its so much like the book, its good but weird.  Then again i havent seen the whole series. <br /> <br />P.S. Heard a rumor a movie is being made out of this...

B00005JMCN|5.0|Seabiscuit is a film that goes beyond any moviegoers expectations; it holds none of the Hollywood glitz and glamour, none of the cheap plot lines that are made for one sole reason- to get the buck.  <br /> <br />This is a film that has heart, strength, hope and courage, all borne on the hooves of an unlikely brown colt who defied the expectations of a nation. With only three people who truly believed in him; a father who lost his son, a cowboy who lost his freedom and a jockey who had nowhere else to go, all of whom were brought together to bring out the glory in this broken-down and mis-used horse, this is an inspirational story that will touch anyone's heart, 'horsey' or not.  <br /> <br />The race scenes are magnificent. The thrumming of hoofbeats seem to thunder off the screen and into your blood, and you can't help but get caught up in each and every victory, each and every failure. For anyone who has ever seen one of the big races live, you can truly appreciate the excitement and energy that comes with the horses pounding down the backstretch. It only takes less than two minutes to raise a nation to its feet; even when those few precious moments come through on an unlikely horse that had more speed, more heart and more game than any other horse that set foot on track with him.
B00008WT5M|4.0|From  1982-89, AC/DC  was  looking  like  their  career  was  over.  Albums  such  as  Blow  Up  Your  Video  and  Fly  on  the  Wall  made  fans  lose  much  of  their  enthusiasm  in  the  band( I  was  one  of  them  by  the  way).  But  then  when  I  had  lost  hope  of  AC/DC  ever  making  another  album  that  could  rival  Back  in  Black  and  Highway  to  Hell  they  produced  The  Razor's  Edge.  This  album  was  a  pleasant  surprise  to  me  and  many  other  AC/DC  fans.  There  are  only  two  other  albums  that  came  after  this one (excluding  Live), Ballbreaker  and  Stiff  Upper  Lip, and  of  the  three  The  Razor's  Edge  is  by  far  the  best. In  essence, this  is  the  last  great  AC/DC  album.  Here  is  how  I  rank  all  the  songs  on  here. <br /> <br />1.  Thunderstruck <br />2.  Moneytalks <br />3.  Fire  Your  Guns <br />4.  The  Razor's  Edge <br />5.  Are  You  Ready? <br />6.  Rock  Your  Heart  Out <br />7.  Mistress  For  Christmas <br />8.  Goodbye  and  Good  Riddance  To  Bad  Luck <br />9.  Let's  Make  It <br />10. If  You  Dare <br />11. Got  You  By  The  Balls <br />12. Shot  Of  Love <br /> <br /> The  only  songs  on  here  that  I  don't  like  are  Got  You  By  The  Balls  and  Shot  Of  Love, but  other  than  those  there  is  no  truly  bad  song  on  here.  Brian's  voice  may  not  be  as  strong  as  it  used  to  be, but  Angus'  guitar  has  never  been  stronger. I  recommend  this  album  to  any  AC/DC  fan  who  is  willing  to  accept  Brian  Johnson  eventhough  he  wasn't  the  original  vocalist. <br /> <br />I  also  recommend  the  following  AC/DC  albums: <br /> <br />High  Voltage- The  debut  album  for  AC/DC  and  one  of  Bon's  best. <br /> <br />Highway  To  Hell- Bon  Scott's  best  album  by  far. <br /> <br />Back  In  Black- Brian  Johnson's  best  album <br /> <br />Live (The  Collector's  Edition)- AC/DC's closest  thing  to  a  greatest  hits  album.

B0002IU988|3.0|I have a tough time describing One Day Remains as good or bad. The first couple times through it struck me as what anyone would expect, Creed's sounds minus Stapp's vocals. I hoped that they would be able to fill in where Creed had left off.  <br /> <br />Find the Real, the song that opens up the album, gets the band off to a decent but weak start. It is followed by the Album's title track, One Day Remains. One Day Remains seems struck me as one of the best songs of the album. It comes off as a very catchy rock song with exceptional guitar work. The lyrics to the song aren't great, but I was more than willing to settle for `new creeds' attempt to put out an instrumentally moving piece not shadowed with an overly religious attitude. All in all a very impressive piece. Next comes Open Your Eyes, which clearly was the groups intended headliner. I found it to be a pretty impressive song, but too much like the old Creed's textbook style. Open Your Eyes is followed by the weak ballad-like track quota filler Burn it Down. It was simply an overall poor song. Metalingus, the next song, opens up with an amazingly energizing, hard sounding beat but kicks down to a weaker overall track. Amazing intro though. Broken Wings and In Loving Memory are the next two songs. Equally weak, they sound very similar and maybe it was originally one song that was split up so the listener wouldn't realize how painfully long it lasted. Down to My Last (breath???) is what follows and shows itself as a moderately memorable song with impressive guitar work. Watch Your Words, Shed My Skin, And The End Is Here round are less than impressive works that are rightfully tucked away in the back of the album. <br /> <br /> I had always enjoyed Creed's music but felt that they had more than they were showing. I figured that maybe Alterbridge would be able to change that, but they didn't with One Day Remains. It had a couple decent songs but nothing worth of too much praise. Maybe pick it up used or borrow it from a buddy, I'm can't say it's worth the $12.99. <br />
B0002BO0AS|5.0|Unearth has always been a great hardcore band but this CD definately outshines their previous releases. The additional focus on adding more metal to the \\"core\\" definately was a good step for this band to take. Songs like \\"Zombie Autopilot\\" and \\"This Lying World\\" purely prove that with melodic riffs that sound straight out of \\"Colony\\" by In Flames. They have got the process of writing a mindblowing, painstakingly heavy breakdown perfected to a science. There is not one song on this record if I can correctly recall that doesn't have an awesome breakdown. (Or 2, or 3) The opening track starts off with a thrash sounding riff that goes right into melody and then into a breakdown. The solo on track 5 is very unexpected and is very atmospheric and cool sounding. They have come the closest to blending everything we love about today's metal and hardcore and blend it into 11 tracks of sheer greatness. Don't pass up the opportunity to purchase this.
B0002F7I9Y|5.0|12 different songs, 12 different artists, yet Ray Charles joins them in their style and does not miss a beat. A fitting epitaph for a great man.  A must buy!!!!
B0001LJCPC|5.0|I love this CD and the movie, but i was wondering if anyone knew what song is playing on the DVD menu screen??
1400031362|3.0|this one was OK (but at times a little tedious), and perhaps even deserves 3 and-a-half stars.  <br /> <br />I don't think I will continue on with this series. \\"Morality\\" took me a long time to finish, even though it's an easy read, because of that tedium I alluded to earlier. But never say never. Who knows, maybe in a few months I will find myself missing those fictional residents of Botswana, and return to the series to read the fourth installment, which I believe is called \\"The Kalahari Typing School for Men.\\" <br /> <br />These are books written in a gentle tone, and in these very trying times that is most welcome.
B00008GKEG|5.0|I got this DVD box set for my birthday and I love it.<br /><br />George, Ringo, Paul, and (archived) John take us behind their career as the world's most beloved band by telling us the story of the Beatles as they remember it.<br /><br />Features four more hours not available/seen on the VHS edition.<br /><br />If you're a fan, buy this now!!!
B00006V9A0|5.0|I've always liked Nirvana. I can't say \\"I'm their biggest fan!\\" because that would be a bold face lie. Since I was younger the songs \\"Smells like Teen Spirit\\" and \\"Lithium\\" have always stood out on the popular rock stations to me back home. Now that I've begun Kurt Cobain's biography, it has giving me more insight into the mind of this somewhat deranged man and into his music. I can find it justified why the music is dark. The other day, I came across the album Nirvana (their greatest hits album) in Target and decided to purchase it. I have not been able to turn it off.  <br /> There is something mesmerizing about Cobain's voice. You can hear the anguish from his past and the passion for his music in every breath he takes. It overpowers you. In the song \\"You Know You're Right\\" the lyrics are evidence of his troubled past, which has become clearer to me after beginning his biography. He sings, \\"Never speak a word again / I will crawl away for good / I will move away from here / You won't be afraid of fear / No thought was put into this / Always knew it would come to this\\". I'm not sure if this is directed to his parents, who he felt deep-seated abandonment from, but it is evident from the way he sings this (he sounds depressed) that it is rooted to his past.  <br /> Not only does Cobain's voice lure you into a trance, but so do the members of Nirvana. Dave Grohl, the drummer, and Krist Novoselic, the bass player, all connect with Cobain's voice that truly exemplifies the band's chemistry. The bass, guitar, drums, and vocals just melt together in such a smooth way.  It is a sincere shame that I have discovered the band so late - I'm sure it would have been a euphoric experience to see them live in concert.  <br />
B000003TA4|5.0|This is just a great cd by one of the best bands of the 90's.  It has about 6 killer songs that even someone that isn't a fan of nirvana can enjoy (smells like teen spirit,in bloom,come as you are, lithium, polly) and 6 other songs that probably will only be appreciated by nirvana fans.  My favorites on here are \\"lithium\\", \\"something in the way\\", \\"on a plain\\", and \\"drain you\\".  The only negative thing I will say about this cd is that it can be really depressing, well for me at least.
B00005JN7O|5.0|Yes, a lot of CGI is used.  So what??  It has a very unique look to it.  I haven't seen another movie (and I've seen a lot) with this look.  If for any other reason check it out for this.  This movie is designed to do one thing, ENTERTAIN. (No Oscars, etc.) It was flat out fun - a mix of 1940's look and movie \\"feel\\" with a modern, futuristic twist.
B000002KKX|5.0|This self-titled debut album from Christopher Cross came out at the tail end of 1979, & it does sound like a '70s record, but what's striking is how it manages to strike an uncanny balance between '70s soft rock & '80s adult contemporary, despite the fact that the '80s hadn't even dawned when this came out (although they nearly had--this came out in the period between Christmas & New Year's in 1979).  For instance, \\"Never Be the Same\\" has a twinkly keyboard sound that strongly brings to mind Elton John's 1989 tune \\"Sacrifice\\", making it easy to see how casual fans would mistake this for a much later recording.  Although there are certainly synthesizers on here, they're really not that prominent at all.  Instead, the record's sound is dominated by lots of warm Fender Rhodes electric piano, acoustic piano, crisp drumming, jazzy guitar solos, etc (in other words, a \\"70s sound\\", if you will).  It's the kind of record that stereo salesmen love to use when demonstrating the abilities of their equipment, & for good reason--the record puts to use the advancements that had been made in recording technology up to that time, yet without any of the '80s synth-mania that was a few years or so down the road.<br /><br />The result is a brightly-polished, warm-sounding album, phenomenally produced by Michael Omartian who, not so coincidentally, had previously worked with Steely Dan (a definitive band for audiophiles).  Check out the wondefully rich-sounding piano chords on \\"Minstrel Gigolo\\" for a perfect example.  This CD release, though not an \\"original recording remastered\\" disc, still sounds great & does the album justice.  Performance-wise, the album is also absolutely first-rate, with such legendary session musicians as Larry Carlton, Jay Graydon, Victor Feldman, Jim Horn, & Chuck Findley, all of whom also played for Steely Dan.  Even future guitar god Eric Johnson plays the solo guitar on \\"Minstrel Gigolo\\".  All that said, this ain't your run-of-the-mill \\"adult contemporary\\"record by a long shot.  One could argue that all the big names such as Michael McDonald, Don Henley, & Nicolette Larson (who all contribute vocals) were merely an attempt to give the album some \\"credentials\\" (with Cross being an \\"unknown\\"), but the thing is, the guests were sincere & clearly into the material, & they contribute positively to the record.  The difference is night and day versus having Nickelback guest with Santana, or the Rolling Stones snapping up Dave Matthews for a cameo--now THAT's crass.<br /><br />As for Cross himself, his crystal clear tenor vocals were sincere & convincing, & he was also a first-rate guitarist in his own right (he played the excellent, extended solo on the fade of \\"Ride Like the Wind\\").  He also wrote every song on here himself, & there isn't a weak song on the entire album--in fact, the album is almost uniformly blissful, with extremely little to complain about whatsoever.  Some of the songwriting is minimalistic, but effectively so, as on the minor-keyed, propulsive Lowell George-dedicated \\"Ride Like The Wind\\", with its simple, repetitive looping piano part & a somewhat minimal verse melody, or \\"Spinning\\" which is so invitingly melodic & lush-sounding that its lack of lyrics ends up not being a problem (although Valerie Carter, whose vocals are prominently featured on the track, does get typically carried away).  Matching the immaculate production values with Cross' winningly sentimental, tuneful songwriting, the album stacks up gem after gem, whether it's the affecting, mellow ballads \\"Sailing\\", \\"Minstrel Gigolo\\", & \\"The Light Is On\\"; the fun, feel-good pop-rocker \\"Say You'll Be Mine\\"; or songs that combine those two elements such as the wonderfully dramatic and uplifting \\"Poor Shirley\\" which puts Cross' Beach Boys/ Brian Wilson influence on full display, and has cathartic high notes from Cross towards the end.<br /><br />This is truly a landmark classic album that very much serves as a benchmark for what adult contemporarymusic should sound like (as opposed to what it SHOULDN'T sound like).  One of my personal favorite albums of all time.
B000000OAL|3.0|Not a great Queen album, but it definitely has some excellent tracks. The best song on this album is Liar, which features some great guitar work. Yeah, some of the lyrics are repeated, but that's okay. Keep Yourself Alive is another great track with strong guitar work. The remix version of Liar is worthless, IMO. <br /> <br />This album is about 3-3.5 out of 5 stars. Good debut album for a great rock band.
B00008OE4W|1.0|This has got to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I really don't understand how it got all these reviews. First of all, to call this movie a thriller is an insult to the genre, and it is a misnomer. The only way to enjoy this movie, if is it is possible at all, is to call it what it is: a comedy. It really is a comedy. But the problem is that it is even a bad one at that. This movie starts out as a thriller, so we don't know it is a comedy, until half an hour or so into it. When you first see the comedy scenes, you think it is a flaw, but keep on watching. But after an hour or so, it totally degenerates. And at the end, the writer or the director must have decided that it is not possible to pull this together anyway, so why not make it a complete comedy? The finale gives the impression that they wanted the movie to be a satire may be, but it is too late for that. I mean it is not possible to make anything of this movie. It is not possible to say it has a plausible or consistent plot. There are gaping holes in the plot. And then it is too serious at times to be a comedy. I would nonetheless put it in that genre. If you want a good thriller, there are very good ones out there, don't waste your time with this. If you want satire on government, or conspiracy theories, don't waste your time with this either. Watch this movie if you can't sleep and there is nothing on TV. Totally disappointing.
B00005JNEI|5.0|You are know what this movie is, most of you have seen it. You like it or you don't. You walk away with a feeling from this movie. Carry that feeling with you, hold it tight and true and remember it when you are in that booth in November.     Remember the America we where, the American we are now, and the America we could be, Then pull the lever. If you watch this movie and you vote for Bush; feel free to explain why to the young widow sitting next to you, or to the young child that lost a parent. The young person sitting next to you that lost a limb fighting a battle that isn't theirs. You can tell them why, even if everything else in this movie is a complete and total lie, why you held your head high and voted for a man that used a public school as a sheild during the worst attack our our nations soil. That is, of course, if you can explain it to your self.     Oh and to anyone that found that \\"85 Delorean\\" cats review helpful, please for the true maning of flip flop, read his review on the 9/11 report.
0449002632|3.0|The great strength of this book is its historical review of the development of the city of London.  You will feel saturated with details when you are finished, but it is a worthwhile and edifying experience.  I was absorbed from start to finish!  I particularly enjoyed the linguistic lessons-- the origins of many common English words and phrases are revealed. <br /> <br />However...this is an enormous book and an ambitious project, so there are bound to be weaknesses.  Chiefly, the characters are not developed sufficiently to make them distinguishable from one another.  Rutherfurd seems to make use of a few \\"stock personalities,\\" which are then reincarnated into new characters in each successive chapter.  Rutherfurd is somewhat more innovative with his storylines, but inevitably one finds \\"loose ends\\" that are not tied up satisfactorily.  Details are mentioned which seem to have significance, but then they do not reappear.  Characters are partially developed and then dropped.  In the effort to keep marching forward through history, plot lines are brought to a close in a hurried fashion.  Sometimes a single sentence or short paragraph attempts to close up a long and complicated story. <br /> <br />To be concise: The characters and storylines are subservient to the rendering of history.  They are vehicles, or a means to an end, so if this doesn't bother you, dive in!
B000000OAN|5.0|A Night at the Opera is a great album, and not just because of the mega-hit Bohemian Rhapsody either. Songs such as You're My Best Friend, I'm in Love with My Car, '39 and Prophet Song are great tracks. A few of the songs are quite odd, but don't hurt the album at all. A must have for any Queen collection.
B000002KMV|4.0|I was 11 years old,the only PRINCE album I had was the self-titled one. I was afraid retailers would shy me away from buying DIRTY MIND due to the warning sticker,so I waited till 1981 for CONTROVERSY. Mine you,I was only listening to black radio at this time and wasn't into rock or punk yet. This album quickly changed that.<br /><br />Songs like \\"Sexually\\",\\"Private Joy\\",\\"Annie Christian\\",\\"Ronnie,Talk To Russia\\" and \\"Jack U Off\\" will put you in that format for sure. While \\"Do Me,Baby\\" is the only ballad and \\"Controversy\\" and \\"Let's Work\\" are your only R&B/funk tunes,the album grows on you.<br /><br />CONTROVERSY is a very important album for PRINCE,it's the album that itched him closer to being the rock superstar that the album 1999 finally made him.
B0000027RL|5.0|Ten is an amazingly awesome CD.  I do not know how anyone can say they hate Pearl Jam.  I'm sure everyone who grew up in the rap generation and has no taste for good music probably hates Pearl Jam, but I don't see how that's possible.  To me, Pearl Jam is real.  This album has all emotions.  They have songs about love, losing love, world issues, personal struggle...They have it all.  Unlike the music today, Pearl Jam mostly write there songs as a part of a story.  Like Vitalogy and Vs., Ten is mostly about Eddy Vedder's childhood and how hard he had it. <br /> <br />I love this album because it has it all.  It has meaningful lyrics, great sounds, and incredibly awesome guitar solos.  Personally, my favorite solo is at the end of Alive.  A lot of people like the music the like for the way it sounds, without bothering to listen to the lyrics.  Although Pearl Jam produces a great sound, their lyrics mean so much more and that's what it is all about. <br />
B00005JMJ4|1.0|The characters in this movie have no character. They sit around looking miserable, staring into space, and one wonders why. Is it because they are in a foreign country? Do they realize that there are curtural activies in Tokyo? Instead they worry about their hormones. Murray is old enough to know better. He gripes to the sweet young thing he has befriended that his wife does not understand him; even though she is a graduate of Yale and married for 2 years, she can commiserate with him. Sure. He proves his virility by a drunken romp in the sack with a redhead that he meets in a bar. In Japan, English is a second language, particularly amoung the younger set, but you wouldn't know it; which is ridiculous; even the translator has problems expressing herself in English. The movie is lost in translation alright, in fact it is lost period. I rented it for 3 bucks. I should get a refund.
B0002S947K|5.0|I recently heard the title track of this CD on public radio and just knew this was worth taking a chance...after all, how many CD's/8-tracks/cassettes/LPs have we bought and ended up only liking the one song heard on the radio?  Anyway....I am so glad I took a chance as I absolutely love this CD.  I am not sure how long this artist has been recording, but I intend to find out.
0688170528|3.0|I cringed several times when I read this book as sometimes it felt as though I was reading a trashy romance novel as the writing is extremely cheesey.  For the first 100 pages I was quite bored and regretted starting the novel as I always finish every book I start. However once one of the characters gets put in jail the whole book comes to life and grips you until the end. <br /> <br />I kept changing my mind all through the book as to whether I thought the accused was guilty of the crime or not.   <br /> <br />It is the kind of book you might take to the beach or on holidays.
B0002ZDVEU|3.0|Like the majority of reviewers I have seen the first Bourne Identity and I loved the movie.  The protaganist, Jason Bourne, is played by Matt Damon, who's previous performances have run the gambit from bad to good, but has been steadily better than most actors.      The story, adapted from the Robert Ludlam novels in a take this-leave that nature, is much better than most adaptations if not completely accurate.  I think the first movie is better than the first book in most places, and is certainly smoother.  The second movie however, does deviate entirely from the book, with the only real connection being the manipulation of Bourne via Marie.  Although this doesn't give the second book much credit, I did find the storyline in the movie easier to get into than the storyline in the book of the same name.  The book's storyline would not fair well in today's climate, and I feel a lot of it would be lost on viewers.    As the storyline from the book is missing, so is the Bourne charachter.  The novel Bourne relies on his smarts as much as his skills, but movie Bourne falls back on his skills more often than not as he stumbles from one situation to the next with little thought, planning or strategy.  As many reviewers have pointed out, he never tries to conceal who he is, which he did heavily in the books.  He also never waits for a perfect situation to present itself, instead he plunges into things head first again relying on his amazing skills to save his life - not like the novel Bourne at all.  He doesn't try and recruit allies or study his advesaries, another side of Bourne dropped for the movies.  While all of this cuts heavily into the Ludlam character, it doesn't ruin Bourne, it merely supplants him with someone else, a little more cinema Bond than true-to-life covert agent, that actually fits the action movie mold better.  However, I couldn't help but miss the conflicted and brooding Bourne from the first film.  To his credit, Matt Damon still plays the roll verywell.      Now, onto the real bad stuff that I have pushed to the end of my diatribe.  After previously stating that the first film was smoother than the book of same name (Bourne Identity), this is sadly not the case with the second film.  If you can concentrate on the flow of the movie, the script, the setup and the acting, the Bourne Supremacy is great (not stupendous), but great.  However, the horrible camera work makes that impossible.  I am not arguing against the insertion of the shaky camera technique, as it worked so well in films such as Saving Private Ryan, but in the excessiveness of its insertion, and the excessiveness of the shaking.  Too much shaky cam, and way, way too much shaking of the shaky cam.  Instead of sticking with the formula of using the up close and personal hand-held camera angle strictly in an acton sense, the Director uses it exclusively throughout the film as if he couldn't tell when to start and when to stop.  I was one of those whose excitement at seeing the movie faded in the opening scene when the camera zooms onto Matt Damons upper lip and we watch as the upper half of his head bounces on and off the screen - no joke! And all we are doing is standing in a bathroom looking in the mirror, not running, not fighting, not performing anything at all that warrants this type of camera work.  I suffered, and eventually I was able to put the bouncing camera into the back of my mind and concentrate on the film.  However, at the rare occasions they switch to a stable platform you let out an involuntary sigh of relief because for a moment you can get your bearings and the screen stops spinning.  But alas, it is only for a moment and then the screen starts bouncing and spinning out of control again.    The issue is only compounded during action sequences when a little jarring is to be expected.  With the Supremacy, the action scenese are a jumbled mess and a large portion of the film simply takes place out of the view of the lens, which is focusing on a shoulder, wall, floor, upper-right corner of the windshield, etc.  Added to that is the darkness that has been heavily layered over this film to the point that you cannot focus on the objects on the screen - when you do suddenly catch a glimpse of something, it is just that, a glimpse! The angle shifts, you are back in shadows and again the camera spins and dips and jumps and flips.  When other reviewers commented on members of the audience becoming sick they were not joking - I myself had to look away periodicly just to adjust, and in the screening of the film someone actually threw up.    Without beating the dead horse anymore, this movie is ruined by the camera work.  I understand what the Director (Paul Greengrass) was going for, but he didn't succeed.  In an attempt to put the viewer on the same level as the actor, we forgoe the structure of a \\"movie\\" and enter a \\"video game\\" instead - only we don't have the luxury of directing the camera at all.  The scenes lose any cinema value because we (the viewers) simply can't see them.  The action scenes put you right in the action, but while you realize there is a conflict, you can't tell from where the blows are coming or who the assailant is, nor can we see how Bourne is responding to the attack because he is a blur - see my hands, see his head, see the floor, see my hands, hear a smack but your looking at the wall, someone fell can't tell who they are blur look at wall door wall fist noise - you see where I'm going.  Frankly, I won't watch another film Greengrass touches after this one.    If I wasn't such a fan of the first one and if I didn't like the story so much, I wouldn't hesitate to give this movie the lowest possible rating because it is simply UNWATCHABLE.  Although this is the type of series that warrants having each installment, this movie will be impossible to watch on your TV - but at least maybe it won't be so overwhelming you need to throw up!
0385504209|1.0|I agree with those reviewers who said it was a page turner for the airport lounge but in the end the plot was a disappointment, it felt like an interruptus: no bang, no surprise, no excitement.<br /><br />So, why add another review?<br /><br />The reason why I write this is a quotation from the San Francisco Chronicle on the back of the book stating that Brown is \\"Eco on Steroids\\".<br /><br />Eco is profound in his research, full of refined craft in his language, intelligent in the plot and honest in the distinction of fact and fiction. Brown fails on all four accounts. The book is just trivial, and not more than that. It even fails on Europe and Catholic bashing by getting facts wrong that would have required much less research than renaissance symbolism. (I do not mind the bashing, it's the artist's freedom - but I prefer informed bashing).<br /><br />Yes, I admit, I needed an encyclopedia when reading Eco's  Name of the Rose or Foucault's Pendulum - but I was never bored . In fact, I learned a lot and had fun at the same time. If the reviewer wants us to believe that Brown is some sort of a Turbo-Eco - nothing could be more misleading than that; at least the publisher should have known better. Eco could have written this book with only his cerebellum working.<br /><br />But the book has a good side too. Numerous American readers are now flocking to the Louvre, contributing to much needed revenues. As the guided tours concentrate only on those few pieces referred to in the \\"da Vinci Code\\", unfortunately the visitors will miss out cultural enlightenment. But that is the curse of a civilization that has adopted the fast food principle, which it had invented, to the understanding of other cultures (as is evidenced by the many factual misrepresentations of Europe and Catholicism in the book).<br /><br />Finally, Dan Brown defeats himself by invoking Leonardo da Vinci's name in the title. His artistic dwarfism is most apparent in contrast to the genius of Leonardo.of Leonardo. <br />
B00023BLXK|4.0|I enjoyed this movie so very much...  <br /> <br />The filming (done in Puerto Rico) was beautiful. True to it's name, it lived up to the Dirty Dancing storyline. Blossoming Romance, Onlooking parents, and of course, DANCING!  <br /> <br />The very best thing about this movie is Diego Luna. What a cutie! I think any woman watching wouldn't mind him leading her across the dance floor! I watched the movie by myself in the living room and had to call my husband at work to say, \\"Let's dance!\\". Needless to say I got a good chuckle! hehe <br /> <br />Anyhow, enjoy the movie. It's a fun one. I wished I had gotten a better ending, but the I enjoyed the film overall.
B00009ATIX|4.0|As a huge fan of Clarke's 2001: A Space Odyssey, I have to say that the Soderbergh version of Solaris is indeed 2001 for 2002.<br /><br />Howso?  Well, first, the visuals speak volumes.  Wordless images combined with the haunting score are enough to really bring one in - if you will let it.  (Personally, I could stare at the Solaris planet and listen to the score for hours on end.)  Solaris is a major player in this movie, even though the planet never utters a word.<br /><br />While I'm not a huge George Clooney fan, I found his performance in this film to be suprisingly appropriate.  Not too many words - the sense of the profound is not lost.  The unexplaniable is left unexplained, and when we are honest with ourselves there will always be something we are forced to accept as unexplained.<br /><br />The movie also explores our preconcieved notions of the world around us (or, more accurately, the universe around us) and also takes us into the mind of a man haunted by the death one one whom he loves.  As an individual who has experienced losses many times before, this movie was almost therapuetic for me.<br /><br />Certainly Solaris has it's weak points.  For those who are purists, it omits a great deal of Lem's original story and the setting is ever-so-subtly changed.  However, Solaris is still a movie that represents for the early twenty-first century what 2001 presented in the sixties.  A movie of reflection and contemplation on the mysteries of the universe.
B0000DYJM6|4.0|This is a great collection of rarities.  The exclusion of \\"State of Love and Trust\\" prevents it from being perfect; regardless it is the band's most cohesive and listenable album.  There is no artsy, pretentious filler, no half-assed sonic experiments.  It's just a great collection of passionate, well-played rock songs.  Until the band releases a singles collection or retrospective (if they ever do, the band, I'm sure, has some sort of quasi-political objection to such things) this will stand as the most representative of the band's albums.  If you like this band at all, buy this album.  If not, why the hell are you reading this?
B000000OUE|4.0|I agree with what most people think; that Rob Zombie's White Zombie Era is better than his solo career.  And while I do enjoy his solo work as well, this is just all around better.  The Solos, Attitude, Lyrics, and even Sex Appeal (Sean) are much better then that of Hellbilly Deluxe or Sinister Urge.  The songs are more diverse and have better rhythm than his later works.  White Zombie is something that is meant to be fun.  Heavy Metal mixed with cars, slightly satanic lyrics and horror movie audio clips and references.  The result is an album with a atmosphere that can frighten some (good christens) and have others moshing and head banging with nothing in their heads but the goal of having a fun time.  That is what Zombie is all about.  This album is very close to being 5 stars but there are a few tracks that I skip a lot.  Here's a breakdown.   <br /> <br />1. Electric Head Pt. 1 (The Agony) 10/10 This is the best song on the album!  Nothing can prevent you from head banging to this thing.   <br />2. Super-charger Heaven 9/10 Fun with Cars and Satanism.   <br />3. Real Solution #9  5/10 Despite it having references from the Texas Chainsaw Massacre (my favorite horror movie) this song just isn't that good.   <br />4.  Creature of the Wheel 10/10 Another HEAVY car song.   <br />5. Electric Head Pt. 2 (The Ecstasy) 6/10 Not nearly as good as part 1, much softer too.  And funky-ness is involved.   <br />6. Grease Paint and Monkey Brains 4/10 Worst track on the album but I still find it listenable.   <br />7. I, Zombie 10/10  While there isn't much to the song, it's fun and heavy and powerful.   <br />8. More Human Than Human 10/10  Duh! <br />9. El Phantasmo And The Chicken Blast O Rama 7/10 Great song, but I don't like the way Rob sings here.   <br />10. Blur the Technicolor 9/10 BAM!  <br />11. Blood, Milk and Sky 9/10 Weird/bizarre song.  Really cool though. <br />Hidden Track.  8/10 Awesome instrumental  <br /> <br />It's quite sad that White zombie No longer exists.  But then again they had 8 records.  Yeah that's right, 8.  They had 5 independent releases.  Unfortunately none of the 5 have very good production and are not very listenable.  Then there is La Sexoristo, Astro Creep and a remix album.  If you like Rob's solo work, then check out Astro Creep, and have a fun time.  Hope this helped.   <br />
B0002NRRAG|5.0|After \\"Dreamland\\" I wondered when this spectacular voice would reappear.  This is a delectable follow-up albeit many years later and it was worth the wait.<br /><br />This voice is so beyond her time but before her time.  She has an effortless palette of notes she moves through with a pitch perfect, low resonant delectability reflective of movie musicals with Gene Kelly and Frank Sinatra.  Yet she's ahead of her time in how she doesn't succomb to fads when she sings jazz or pop.  She opts to stay true to her own style and it is a remarkable journey to take with her through these tracks - most highly recommended.
B00000JCB2|5.0|Significant Other is an unbelievable album.  This assortment of rock and a little bit of rap combined by the band Limp Bizkit has become the best cd in my collection.  Starting off with the low soul catching type of soft rock and then hitting the listener up with a blast of hard rock is unbelievable.  Its bears all listener, going from the mellow rock , up to hand banging rock and then to a humorous rap is a great way to catch all the listeners attention.  By doing that they don't only reach out to one type of genre but all the different types. <br /> Because their known for their heavy rock, screaming from their longs, bringing a well known rapper, Method Man, on to the album might have upset some of there hardcore fans.  But by adding Method it got a whole different community involved with their music.  To be honest the one hit that really caught my attention was \\"N together now\\" which featured Method Man.  Without the collaboration of the two making a great song I don't think I would have gotten into them.  I realized that each song is unique its own way and the band is not like any other.  Just to hear the uniqueness in the album is totally worth the money to spend on this great cd. <br />
B0002T7ZKW|5.0|To Darren...if you consider \\"red-neck agenda\\" to be anti-liberal and pro-Bush...you are indeed an American Idiot. <br /> <br />This album is really good.  I like to see Greenday expirament a bit more with their sound.  It shows some growth within the band.  They're willing to step outside the box, and that's awsome.

B00005JGAF|5.0|In a small town in Pennsylvania was a little Mom and Pop record store. About 1978 or so, that Palmyra record store began to get a lot of \\"promo only\\" albums, the majority of which were by artists in the underground punk scene. Elvis Costello, Talking Heads, Dead Boys, Saints and a whole bunch of others. At a buck a pop, I was feeding my curiosity on a regular basis, going into the store literally every couple of days to see if any new albums had appeared.<br /><br />One of those trips had two fresh items in the front of the bin... \\"Rocket To Russia\\" and \\"Road To Ruin\\" by The Ramones. I grabbed them both and went over to my friend Chuck's. He had been playing guitar for a year or so, and I'd been writing for as long as I could remember. We went into his basement and put \\"Rocket To Russia\\" on the turntable. As soon as \\"Rockaway Beach\\" was over, our world had changed. Chuck had his guitar in his hands before the end of side one, because we knew that we could do this, too. By the end of the week, we'd recruited a bassist and a drummer and formed a band.<br /><br />Two songs. That was all it took to literally make our lives change course. \\"Rocket To Russia\\" is literally that powerful an album, and remains a watershed moment in punk rock. You get the seminal \\"Cretin Hop,\\" \\"Sheena Is A Punk Rocker\\" \\"Teenage Lobotomy\\" and what may be one of the most important Top 100 singles of the decade, \\"Rockaway Beach.\\" You discover that all sorts of classics could be hammered into rock, as \\"Do You Wanna Dance\\" blasted surf music into smithereens.<br /><br />So I write this, all but blubbering into my computer screen. Johnny's gone now, along with Joey and Dee Dee. Three quarters of the \\"brothers\\" that not only kicked complacent music in the kiester, but rallied four high school guys in 1978 to get on stage and make a glorious racket with three minute ditties we wrote ourselves. \\"Rocket To Russia\\" reconfigured my world. Turned up to 10, it still makes my head bob. Anyone who ever cared about rock and roll should have this album.<br /><br />Sad to say, my world reconfigured again today. RIP, Johnny.cared about rock and roll should have this album. <br /> <br />Sad to say, my world reconfigured again today. RIP, Johnny.
B0002234LS|5.0|Even though, I haven't checked out too much of Stephen King's stuff, I have seen a few Johnny Depp movies like Edward Scissorhands and Sleepy Hollow and...WELCOME KIDS TO INVESMENT PIRATES OF THE CARRIBEAN! YOUR MONEY CHECKS IN IT DOESN'T CHECK OUT! {I stole that from Robin Williams Live On Broadway}. So this is my second favorite movie anyway. This IS a pretty neat movie with Johnny Depp and a couple of other people like Timothy Hutton. I TOTALLY RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE WHO LIKES JOHHNY DEPP OR STEPHEN KING MATERIAL. The commercials for Secret Window make it look like it's a lot worse than it actually is. UH-UH. THIS IS AN EXCELLENT MOVIE. If you watch it, let me give you some advice: Be patient and wait for the good stuff. It'll come soon enough......I'm not even kidding. This is excellent.
B00005JGAB|5.0|The title of my review sums up my feeling about the Ramones first album. It is every bit as important as the albums and bands it fostered and sometimes seemed overshadowed by (Clash, Sex Pistols, U2, etc.) and the kind of chainsaw rock that preceded it (MC5, Iggy and the Stooges). There are the influences that aren't so obvious but eventually became easier to see (Beatles, Beach Boys, bubblegum). \\"Hey Ho, Let's Go!\\" became the rallying cry and thousands of flaming youth grabbed a guitar in the aftermath.<br /><br />Johnny's buzzsaw chording was so simple that his power was deceptive. Joey's lost between NYC and the UK voice sounded unlike anything on record, but drew you in, and the songs were hook laden hand grenades. Pull the pin, yell 1-2-3-4 and throw. It wasn't just the sound, it was the look. Like some kind of mutant Beatles, the mop-tops, leather jackets, sneakers and torn jeans, the Ramones not only sounded great, they looked cooler than anything the seventies spandex strutters of the day could ever hope for.<br /><br />The shame of the thing is, \\"Ramones\\" probably sold fewer copies than it cost to make. Nowadays, \\"Blitzkrieg Bop\\" is played at football stadiums and used to sell cell phones and beer. I don't know whether to be happy or to be flustered that, once again, rebelling against conformity gets absorbed into shilling for the corporations. What can I say? Your answer lies in this shiny disc, when you stand up in Johnny/Dee Dee air guitar stance and turn \\"Judy Is A Punk\\" to ten. Do you still care about rock and its place in the world? Then you need \\"RAMONES.\\"
B000002GB2|5.0|The Grand Illusion was the album that brought Styx their superstar fame. Most people did not know that two albums prior, and pre Tommy Shaw Styx REALLY had their 'true' masterpeice. Equinox is it. Equinox may rate as one of the best art rock albums of all time. Back when CD's were albums, side two of this masterpeice had no equal. Crank WAAAYYYY up Midnight Ride, Hit the volume even further for this albums best Born For Adventure, then comes the GREAT, GREAT closer Suite Madame Blue. INCREDIBLE!!!! By the way side one is REALLY good also! Pieces of Eight, The Grand Illusion, and Paradise Theatre were all excellent albums. As great as thos albums were they still cant touch Equinox. By FAARRRRR Styx's best work!!!!!! <br /> <br />  For some GREAT new music check out Glen Burtnik's Welcome To Hollywood. It's a TRULY incredible CD. Bam, Another, Kiss Your Ass Goodbye, Superboy & the Title track are all classics.
015204907X|1.0|I was a bit surprised to see this book which seems so highly similar to a 1960s German children's book \\"Were is the Green Parrot\\" (published in English I think by Bodley Head) -okay, we've got a sheep now instead of a parrot, but the idea and structure are so similar I feel it pushes the boundaries of what we might expect of originality of concept. I suppose ideas are not copyright, but it still seems to me a bit rich.  Have a look at Where is the Green Parrot and make up your own mind.
B0000009OP|5.0|If you are a music lover looking for something accessible, yet different then what's been done over and over, this is an album for you. Tightly written well played songs that to me are reminiscent of the Doors. The best album from an excellent band.
B000001FFJ|5.0|I know, I know, Small Change, Mule Variations, Swordfishtrombones, Alice and Nighthawks at the Diner, as well as Frank's Wild Years....they are all good albums that I'd recommend...but Rain Dogs is the one I say to acquire if only one. Rain Dogs is nasty, brutal, beautiful and funny. I am a Waits lover and find this album's playing always needed.
B00030590I|5.0|It will always remain beyond me how such a breathtaking work of art was both kept on the shelves for two years, killing its chances of wide Awards recognition, and sold off as a mindless, heartless action flick derived from the mind of Quentin Tarantino and the \\"skill\\" of Jet Li, rather then giving those who deserve most of the credit any notice (i.e. director Zhang Yimou, the beautiful and talented Maggie Cheung, the profound Tony Leung). Also, though the action doesn't surprise me, I'll forever be disappointed in the media's constant need to compare it with 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,' another martial arts film that is similar in nature, but not in structure, execution, or story. <br /> <br />Let's get that part straightened out: just because both 'Crouching Tiger' and 'Hero' are from the same nation, are both action-oriented films, and both include Zhang Ziyi in its supporting cast does not by any means make them at all comparable to each other. At each's core is an immensely different film. I will end this discussion of the two here, because I don't want to fall in that trap of irrelevant comparison as a cop-out. <br /> <br />'Hero' is first and foremost profound. Its imagery, characters, action sequences, and reality vs. internal portrayal storyline all interconnect with astounding cohesiveness, never separating from each other, working back and forth to create one of the best films of the year. Never once did I lose track of what the film was saying, or its nuanced emotional power. Most felt disconnected from it, but when you allow yourself to be embedded into the complexity of the human story (executed brilliantly with a finely crafted screenplay), 'Hero' immediately becomes three-dimensional, unfolding into something much more than an on-the-surface, mediocre war drama. <br /> <br />If you happen to find Foreign films abysmal, forcing you to concentrate a bit too hard for your tastes, still take the time to see 'Hero.' It is most famous for its equallydeep imagery. You know you're seeing something mind blowing and revelatory when a character's robes blowing in the wind are as accurately choreographed as Maggie Cheung fending off a barrage of arrows.  <br /> <br />What further elevates 'Hero's standing as a great film is its precise and intelligent use of its beauty. It is not simply appealing to the eye for the sake of having astounding visuals. The colors work into the story, changing as its two central characters, Nameless (Jet Li) and the King of Quin (Daoming Chen), reflect on their own interpretations of Nameless' explanation as to how he defeated three notorious assassins --Broken Sword (Tony Leung), Long Sky (Donnie Yen), and Flying Snow (Maggie Cheung)-- that have been out for the King's blood for years after he had massacred their people. The colors --red, blue, green, and white-- not only distinguish the separate versions visually, but also distill each's emotional foundation, causing the experience of watching this film to be much more involving.  <br /> <br />I should not focus too much on the imagery, however. If you enter the film concentrating on the visuals alone, you may risk distraction, ultimately ruining this particular cinematic experience. I highly recommend this film, but I advise those who are interested to keep its themes of inner conflict, abuse of power, and the hindrance of paranoia in mind. Luckily, Zhang Yimou has done such a fantastic job honing, polishing, and crafting this film, processing it may not be too difficult for some. The combination of this subtle emotional power, Maggie Cheung and Tony Leung's masterful performances, Yimou's heartfelt direction, and Christopher Doyle's finely detailed cinematography proves to be one of the most satisfying, memorable, and epic experiences I've had at the theater in years.
B00008DDSC|5.0|If you insist on being offended by relationship types that fall outside your own preferences, you may not enjoy this movie.  As for me, while I have no interest in BDSM (Domination/Submission), I found it easy and enjoyable to buy into the premise of this movie.   <br />The reason it works is because it becomes clear that these two people are *good* people.  They have their issues, but deep down, they want love like everyone else.  And this IS a love story, with a arc just like any other love story.   It's very engaging and very funny, largely due to great performances by James Spader and Maggie Gyllenhaal.
B00000FC5H|4.0|One thing is for certain about Earth Wind and Fire -  There is no shortage of compilations of their greatest hits out there.   From an initial scan of looking at their discography, I was able to come up 8 main ones - and I'm sure there are others in terms of imports and obsolete collections.   Some of these greatest hits are specialized collections while others are dated.  This CD, \\"Earth Wind and Fire Greatest Hits\\" is one of these 8.   I'll discuss how this particular set stands out, but first I think it's appropriate to go through some of the other Earth Wind and Fire collections to make you aware of what is out there. <br /> <br />1.\\"Earth Wind and Fire Greatest Hits Volume 1\\": This was a very popular set from 1978s.  It features the debut of the classic song \\"September\\" and the release of Earth Wind and Fire's cover of the Beatles' \\"Got to Get You Into My Life\\" <br /> <br />2.\\"Earth Wind and Fire Greatest Hits Volume 2\\":  This does feature songs from EWF that were released after Volume 1 as well as other songs not included on Volume 1.  It also features the song \\"Fantasy\\" that was found on Volume 1. <br /> <br />3.\\"Super Hits\\":  A limited set 10 track set that isn't entirely devoted to the big time EWF hits. <br /> <br />4.\\"The Essential Earth Wind and Fire\\":  Notice how greatest hits albums are now being called \\"Essential\\".   This is actually a pretty comprhensive 2 disc set.  The first disc contains 20 studio tracks and the second disc contains 13 remixes. <br /> <br />5.\\"Let's Groove\\": The Best of Earth Wind and Fire:  A 17 track Collection that focuses on EWF's dance songs. <br /> <br />6.\\"Elements of Love: The Ballads\\": A 14 track collection focusing on the softer, ballad songs of EWF. <br /> <br />7.\\"The Eternal Dance\\":  A Comprhensive 3 disc boxed set that contains also contains some unreleased and live tracks. <br /> <br />\\"Earth Wind and Fire: Greatest Hits\\"  is one of the better compilations that has been released.   It isn't as comprehensive as \\"TheEssential\\" or \\"The Eternal Dance\\".   However it is important to note that even those comprehensive collections are not all-inclusive of the material that is found on \\"Greatest Hits\\".  The song \\"Gratitude\\" that is on \\"Greatest Hits\\" is not found on \\"The Essential\\" or \\"The Eternal Dance\\".  \\"Serpentine Fire\\", \\"Kalimba Story\\", and \\"Can't Hide Love\\" (original studio version) are all found on \\"Greatest Hits\\" but not found on \\"The Essential\\".      The dated \\"Volume 1\\" collection contains a song \\"Love Music\\" not found on \\"Greatest Hits\\".   Therefore, it is safe to say that one collection isn't going to encompass everything.    <br /> <br />However, although \\"Greatest Hits\\" doesn't include everything - it isn't a bad place to start.   If a casual fan is looking to get started with Earth Wind and Fire - they are going to get 17 very good tracks that cover Earth Wind and Fire's peak period from the mid 70s through 1981.   This collection doesn't contain any new studio cuts or remix variants, so what you are going to get are a nice selection of some of EWF's best works.    One thing that does disappoint is the arrangement of the songs on the CD.   I usually prefer my greatest hits CD to be in chronological order.  In the case of \\"Greatest Hits\\", it doesn't go in chronological order and as a result this is a disappointment. <br /> <br />This collection does contain some older works by EWF - including the funkish \\"Kalimba Story\\" and the horn-based \\"Mighty Mighty\\".   These songs are from the 1974's \\"Open Our Eyes\\" release.  Also included are songs casual fan may not be as familar with: \\"Can't Hide Love\\"; \\"Gratitude\\"; \\"Serpentine Fire\\"; \\"Reasons\\"; and \\"Saturday Night\\".  \\"Saturday Night\\" features some of the classic Philip Bailey vocals singing \\"London Bridge is Falling Down\\".  These songs are also a part of this collection. <br /> <br />You will also hear some of the true EWF classics such as \\"Shining Star\\", \\"That's the Way Of the World\\", \\"September\\",  \\"Fantasy\\",  and \\"After the Love is Gone\\".  Also included is the classic cover of the Beatles \\"Got to Get You Into My Life\\".   EWF and this song were a part of the 1978 film \\"Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\\" and you will hear why many people consider this even better than the Fab Four's original.    You will also hear some of the dance classics such as \\"Let's Groove\\", \\"Boogie Wonderland\\", and \\"Getaway\\".   <br /> <br />Although this isn't a boxed set, the liner notes in this collection provide a wealth of information to learn all about Earth Wind and Fire\\".   For starters, there is a four panel writeup (the liner notes fold out as opposed to be stapled) entitled \\"The Eternal Groove\\" by Mark Coleman.  This tells the story of how Maurice White built the band - including why he brought Philip Bailey into the band.  The writeup covers up until 1981.   In addition to this writeup, there is an \\"Earth Wind and Fire Family Tree\\".  This lists all of the permutations of Earth Wind and Fire - including the early days of Maurice's original band \\"The Salty Peppers\\".  Kevin Goins and Leo Sacks provide annotations explaining all of the band changes.   Also included is a list of all of the band credits - including many of the background studio and orchestral musicians.  Finally, there is a terrific discography that lists all of the songs.  Each song includes the album it came from, the year it was released, songwriting credits, arrangement credits, and how it charted. <br /> <br />In terms of selecting which compilation is the best one for you - look carefully at the content.   While sets like \\"The Essential\\" and \\"The Eternal Dance\\" are deep, these are probably going to do a better job at satisfying the seasoned EWF fan.   Seasoned fans may also look to \\"Let's Groove\\" and \\"Elements of Love\\" for more specialized compilations.  In terms of a fan looking to start with EWF for the first time, \\"Greatest Hits\\" is a perfect place to start.
B00009V7T2|5.0|I decided to write a review when I looked at my play count for this album and realized it had reached double digits. In 2 days. <br />There isn't much to say that hasn't certainly been said, so I will just say this; <br />if you use a cd player, you will need to buy this multiple times, because every time you hear it you notice something new, you'll notice something beautiful, something ugly, something whatever, and you will listen to it again.  and again... and again.
0312119038|4.0|I resonate deeply with Karen Armstrong's spiritual journey as outlined in this, her autobiographical sketch of her seven years in a convent. While I was never in such a highly concentrated and ostracized community as her convent, my own spiritual journey was marked by eighteen years of a stridently sectarian and legalistic environment that masked any ability on my part to know God. Within this book one can see Karen's desire to know God - which originally motivated her to dedicate her life to Him by service in the convent - but also her struggles with the life of faith and the distance of God. She and I share a profound desire to know God, but an equally profound consternation and lack of understanding of what those people who talk of their close relationship with God mean. Her search for God has led her to a view of God that is one I can deeply appreciate, although am not educated enough to be able to critically evaluate in full.
B00000J7S8|5.0|Diana Krall is fast becoming one of the greats - and \\"When I Look In Your Eyes\\" is, perhaps, her best effort yet.  Each song is a gem - and what a collection of songs - \\"Let's Fall in Love,\\" \\"Let's Face the Music and Dance,\\" \\"I've Got You Under My Skin.\\"  \\"Popsicle Toes\\" is a treat (I never tire of hearing that song).  If you're anything like me, you have a number of friends who'll claim \\"they don't make music like that anymore.\\"  Well, just slip this into the CD player and watch as their face lights up.  It's positively magical.  Everything old is new again.  A terrific CD.
0446310786|5.0|The youngest of four children, Harper Lee was born in 1926 in Alabama. She won the Pulitzer Prize with \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" - her only novel - which was first published in 1960.  <br /> <br />The story is set in 1930s Maycomb, Alabama, and is told by Scout Finch. In it, she looks back to her childhood, between the ages of six and nine years. A lively, intelligent and fiercely loyal child, she has one older brother called Jem, whose main interest is football. Despite an age difference of nearly four years, the siblings are clearly very close. Their mother died when Scout was two and they have been brought up by their father, Atticus - who proves to be a man you can't help admiring. Calpurnia, their housekeeper, seems to have been a great help to Atticus in raising the children. At times, Scout seems to have seen her as something of an adversary, though they become much closer as time goes on. Among their neighbours are the mysterious Radleys - Mr. Arthur, better known as Boo Radley, hasn't been seen outside for many years. He has become something of a legend that inspires a certain amount of fear among the children. Another neighbour, Miss Maudie, is an entirely different proposition - a very likeable character, she proves to be a very good friend to the children and one of Maycomb's more admirable residents.  <br /> <br />Another of the children's friends in Chet Baker Harris, a boy from Mississippi who is better known as Dill. He spends his summer with his Aunt Rachel, another of Scout's neighbours. Dill is the driving force behind one of the book's major themes : the quest to make Boo Radley come outside. The other theme, however, is a lot more serious - it deals with a court case where a black man has been charged with raping a white woman, on very flimsy evidence. The attitude of many of the townsfolk to the man in question, and to the black community in general, confuse the children greatly. The consequences of these attitudes have a direct impact on the Finch family, given that Atticus has been appointed the defence attorney.  <br /> <br />I tend to be very suspicious of a book if it's referred to as a 'classic' - too many of those I've read (or been forced to read) have been far too tedious. \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\", however, is what a classic should be - superbly written, with an excellent story and featuring characters you genuinely care about. Its screen adaptation is also widely regarded as a classic, leading to an Oscar for Gregory Peck, who played Atticus. Neither the book, nor the film, should be missed.
B00004LN16|5.0|First of all, it is obvious that ac/dc will never top any of their older albums, so why must everyone feel the need to compare all their new stuff with old stuff? Review the album for what it is, not what it is not anymore.  Just because another album was better than this does not mean this one automatically sucks.  Considering AC/DC is STILL AROUND after all these years and still touring, I find this album to be great.  Not too many bands can keep putting out album after album with decent music like these guys.  For instance, Iron Maiden has been around just as long and still seem to be releasing awesome new material.  Bottom line, this album is a good buy for your money.  And if you have not seen them on tour yet, GO!!!
B00005QENZ|4.0|1993's Get a Grip was the follow up to Aerosmith's 1989 classic Pump.While Get a Grip was a huge smash hit, it doesn't rank anywhere close to most of it's preceeders.I'd say it falls into the ranks of Draw the Line,A Night in the Ruts, and Rock in a Hard Place, all decent albums but not really up to the standards of the rest of Aerosmith's albums. Their where a handful of hit singles from the album, including Livin' on the Edge, Cryin', Crazy, and Amazing. The album is a polished affair with professional songwriters brought in, but it doesn't have the edge of Permanent Vacation or Pump(both of these albums they used professional songwriters also). Where Pump came close to bringing the Aerosmith sound back to what it used to be, Get a Grip makes a bid for radio airplay, and attracking more of a pop audience then their earlier work.If you like Aerosmith I'm sure you'll like Get a Grip, but I just want to say that it's not one of Aerosmith's best albums, go out and buy the first four albums instead of this one, then you'll hear the real Aerosmith.
B00004SAJK|3.0|The closing days of UFO's musical genius. <br />Let me say this, THIS band rocks and has been a big part of my life since listening to LIGHTS OUT back in about 77 0r 78. <br />I've listened to just about everything they done through-out the years, and have had and still do have a lot of pleasure doing so. <br />I remember seeing them back with Ozzy in the old Boston Garden as the opening act when this album came out. <br />As a big fan this is far from there best. <br />lets start with track by track. <br /> <br />1. Kicks ass sounds good to my ears, even has a taste of the old days mixed in there (i've always liked brass in rock n roll, gives it an extra punch)i give it an A <br /> <br />2. A cover of an oldies song, pretty cool but in my mind they didnt need to rework this number or any other for that matter.I'll give it a C <br /> <br /> <br />3. A big time ballad which UFO does beautifully as always. <br />Phil has a way of putting ballads across that i haven't found in  <br />an other rock singer.An A in my book. <br /> <br />4.A cool rocker thats O.K. there for i'll give it a rateing of a C. <br /> <br />5.Same as the one above C. <br /> <br />6.Same as the one above C. <br /> <br />7. This song somehow makes me want to sing a long every time i hear it, there for i'll at lest throw it a B. <br /> <br />8. Another one of Phils great ballads always reminds me of my girlfrinds back in the teenage years / A, thats the rateing on this number. <br /> <br />9. Same as the above tracks # 4,5,6, another C <br /> <br />10. Yet another C on this CD. <br /> <br />11. Now this song  sounds like it should've never even been recorded.  <br />What a mess, never play this track if you want to show off some UFO. <br /> <br />So do you see what i mean folks, it's basically just filler tracks... to many C's. <br /> <br />UFO is a great band and there's a lot more to go buy then this. <br />But if you love the band the way i do, you'd own it. <br /> <br />LONG LIVE REAL ROCK n ROLL!!!
B0000029AP|5.0|Walk this Way and Sweet Emotion being radio hits in 75/76 set the stage for the album Toys in the Attic to be a big hit.While the first two albums had faired respectably Toys in the Attic put the boys from Boston on the map.Aerosmith had already made two great albums,this one was the one that had multiple hits, so everybody had to buy the album,and then they were treated to a hard rock classic.From beginning to end Toys in the Attic holds up great,and is one of the greatest albums of it's time.29 years after it's release about half the songs on the album are still making it into their concert setlists.These boys know how to rock,Aerosmith is one of the greatest rock n roll bands of all-time and has retained a huge audience more than 30 years into the game.For fans new to Aerosmith buy this album first, even if you buy all of their hits complations you still must buy Toys in the Attic, as well as Get Your Wings, and Rocks.
B000002JEV|5.0|For the longest time, the only Led Zeppelin cds I owned were the BBC Sessions. Eventually I got their early and later studio albums but came to realize that I liked the BBC Sessions better. If you like Led Zeppelin and you don't have this double disc live album then you are missing out on one of their greatest cds. The first disc isn't as good as the second disc, in my opinion, but it is still amazing. I love the version of Stairway To Heaven; it's much better than the studio version. Each disc is filled almost to capacity of 80 mins each with tons of great songs. I recommend this completly.
B000069AUI|5.0|<br />To answer Danielle's question, the lyrics she quotes are from Coldplay's 'Parachutes' album, from track two, called 'Shiver'. <br /> <br />Though I knew this anyway, the best way to find answers to questions such as this, is to type the lyrics into Google. Voila! <br /> <br />Anyway, Rush of Blood is another cracker from the college boys. Loved Parachutes, even though it was too short. This is better and far more uplifting. <br /> <br />Must get back to work now!
0060934700|4.0|I may not think that all pieces herein are his best work, but it's a relatively good introduction to Neil Gaiman if you've never heard of him or read his post-SANDMAN work.  SMOKE AND MIRRORS is one of the very few books that have a \\"reserved spot\\" on my bedside table and travel bag.  Need a quick read before hitting the sack, while waiting in the airport, while lying on the beach?  Open it up and choose a story, a poem, a sestina.  I've lost count of how many times I've re-read SMOKE AND MIRRORS, but remember where I've taken it and what new insight it always gives me.  It could be \\"the black cat\\" of your literary life....
B0002IQHY8|5.0|I will admit the first time I listened to Alan's newest CD... well, all I could think was that it was nothing like the old stuff and I did not like it.  I brought it to work and listened to it a few more times.  After the 5th time through, I started to really enjoy all the tracks. <br /> <br />I have listened to it many more times since then, and I love it more and more.  It IS VERY DIFERENT, but it just may grow on you in time.  Do not give up on it after only once through. <br /> <br />I have to give this 5 stars... simply because I enjoy listening to this CD.
0061015725|3.0|Typical to all of Mr. Crichton's works is a great twist on reality that hits so close that it almost could be, and thank goodness it isn't!  The story was intriguing but unfortunatley it was a bit predictable.  I knew what to expect about one hundred pages before the end of the book.
B000002H97|5.0|When I first listened to this album i was only in 7th grade but from that day on I knew that this album is one that I would have to keep with me forever. Hearing about how great it was from my cousins and friends didn't do this album any justice. From beginning to end, this album is by far the greatest collection of songs ever put together. The wierd thing is that this album stepped aside from the traditional heavy, heavy metal sound of Metallica and their lightning fast guitar playing heard in albums like And Justice For All or Master of Puppets. This simple fact may be what allowed this album to reach out to so many people. Now that fewer people would be driven away by the more mellow sound, James Hetfield's lyrics could touch so many more.  <br /> <br />But don't get me wrong, for those old school Metallica fans, this album still offers those same traits that gathered such a huge fan base from before. By making this album, Metallica easily convinced new listeners to go out and listen to some of their other albums - its what happened to me - and make their fans truly appreciate what Metallica has been able to accomplish. <br /> <br />Metallica's influence, due not only to the greatness of this album, can be seen and heard in countless of today's bands. Go to any band's homepage and more than 75% of them will list Metallica as one of their greatest influence, a well deserved honor. <br /> <br />If you listen to this song, there is absolutely no way in hell that there won't be at least one song that you will like. If you want to hear a soft, melodic song where the lyrics of the song just touch you, play \\"Nothing Else Matters\\" but if you really just want to let out some agression or just piss off your neighbors, crank up the volume and listen to \\"Holier Than Thou\\". The point is this: no matter what you're looking for, you'll be able to find it in this album...guaranteed.
B00023B1A8|5.0|This is an absolutely fabulous concert with the trio, their guitars and a piano. One year ago, I finally got a chance to see CSN live, front row at the Iowa State Fair. As I left the show, I wished I could have had a video of the event. I was so pleased to see that there was concert video available.<br /><br />This DVD was produced and directed as well as any I've ever seen. The surround sound remastered and digital quality video will make you feel like you were there (with the best seats in the house)!<br /><br />The songs performed span their career together and their harmony (as always) will send chills through the body of any true fan of the best trio of all time.<br /><br />Best of the BEST!
B0001YRVN4|1.0|The release of the Star Wars Original Trilogy, even including these new-fangled special effects, is greatly anticipated and, yeah, I'll still buy it when it comes out. <br /> <br />Although I wouldn't buy the cropped Pan and Scan (Full Screen) edition as it chops off half the original widescreen image to make it fit into a rectangular television shap, so you're literally watching half the film. <br /> <br />One shouldn't fret too much, as Fox is also releasing the Widescreen version of this on the same day so one can view the experience as George Lucas intended it to be seen.
B0000DBJDM|4.0|Live at Pompeii is the most recent version of the video released. The original version is interspersed with archive footage of the band (David, Roger, Nick, Richard, etc.etc.)working on the Darkside Of the Moon album at Abbey Road. These snippets are interesting and informative - particularly wehere you see Roger operting an anologue synth for On The Run - for the first time around, but start to really grate on repeated viewings when you realise what a bunch of pretentious g*ts they can be, apart from Richard who seems pretty much down to earth.  <br /> <br />The video shot in pompeii is one of the most atmospheric and haunting videos I have seen becuase it has no special effects to create the atmosphere, just an empty ampitheatre and the band. There are stunning versions of late early stuff, echoes, One of theses days, carteful with that axe, and saucerful of secrets. <br /> <br />The most awesome segment for me is the instrumental section of echoes with Dave gilmours guitar screaming amidst the theatre, capturing the experimental and exciting yet alienating and isolated atmosphere of their early work, some of it a bit disturbing and strange. <br /> <br />The DVD is a good package, with the recut version and and the original version presented in widescreen and 4:3 normal ratio. There is adocumentary, slideshows of screening posters, and different packaging for the VHS versions, as well as other stuff and a button which selects an item at random, very strange- trying to install the weird nature of the band, no doubt some of Storm Thorgersons work.
B00008DDSC|4.0|This is a very different movie about a woman who gets a job as a secretary.  It seems the more the boss abuses here (he loves to read circle her typos), the more she enjoys it.  It gets to the point where her boss finally starts spanking her.  This changes her psyche and she no longer is attracted to her fiancee, who thinks it is a joke when she requests he spank her. <br /> <br />Her whole world seems lost, when her boss tires of the game and proceeds to fire her.  She then decides to go through with a wedding with her boyfriend, only to change her mind at the end with a scene reminiscent of The Graduate. <br /> <br />Good entertainment!
B00028HBKM|5.0|In years to come, THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST will be the standard for any movie about the death of Jesus.  Mel Gibson's personal vision erases any memories of Hollywood's attempts to cinematize the last days of Jesus on earth.<br /><br />Forget the anti-Semitic ravings; forget the claims of brutality and gore for gore sakes; forget Gibson's personal \\"asides\\".  This movie should be required for any Christian who believes in the Messiah and understands that his death was for us, for all generations, with no blame being placed, only the eternal message of love one another at its foundation.<br /><br />No movie has affected me as much as this movie.  Being a Catholic, I have tended to think of movies like \\"The Greatest Story Ever Told\\" or 'King of Kings\\" as representations of the Passion.  This movie, however, overwhelms the others by presenting the scourging and the Crucifixion in the brutal means in which they occurred.  How anyone can watch this movie and not feel the lashes of the whips, the pain of the nails and not be touched is beyond me.  Gibson has helmed a movie that I will never forget.  There are so many images that haunt me that it's hard to pinpoint any of them.  I cried, but not only at the brutality of the Roman soldiers and the hordes of people who spit, mocked and humiliated this gentle man whose only crime was his heritage.  I cried when a mother remembered her son's first fall, and how she rushes to him when he drops beneath the weight of the cross; the memories of Jesus' dining room table; the Last Supper.  It is to not only Gibson's credit, but to the actors, technicians, Caleb Deschanel's cinematography, John Denby's awesome score, that THE PASSION is a movie of epic proportions.<br /><br />James Caviezel doesn't say a whole lot, but his trip to Golgotha is a brave performance, and Jim is magnificent.  Equally impressive is Maia Morgenstern as Mary, the mother.  With very little dialogue, Morgenstern embodies the heart of this extraordinary woman, and her performance is Oscar worthy, as is Caviezels.  Monica Bellucci as Mary Magdalene is wonderful, as is Jacob Mehr who plays Simon of Cyrene.<br /><br />THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST is not an easy movie to watch; many times I wanted to turn my eyes away.  But it is one of the most inspirational films I have ever seen.  Mel Gibson is to be applauded for taking a personal risk for a personal vision that can be shared by not only Christians, but all men and women.  Don't let the negative hype deter you from this magnificent film.ance is Oscar worthy, as is Caviezels.

B00005JLWN|3.0|OK, so we all know that Equilibrium is really Brazil meets Fahrenheit 451, with a portion of The Wall, a dollop of Metropolis on top, a hint of Dark City, a side portion of 1984 and just a twist of Matrix, but it's still an entertaining and occasionally thought-provoking 100 minutes. <br /> <br />Christian Bale plays a blinder as the dispassionate cleric, whose emotions - now strictly outlawed, start to bubble to the surface. Some of the dialogue with his son is genuinely chilling and the relationship with the doomed prisoner, who awakens memories of his dead wife, is very moving.  <br /> <br />The criticism levelled at the paucity of action, I feel, was unfair, as Equilibrium is not primarily intended to be an action movie. Its message, if indeed one was intended, is surely to make us consider the qualities of humanity and to be aware of forces that would drive us towards totalitarianism. Admirable stuff indeed!  <br /> <br />The sets are suitably convincing, in a post-gothic, pseudo-nightmarish fashion, the sound is superb - Dolby digital has rarely sounded better as those bullets seem to ricochet around your living room, and Wimmer's direction is clever and sometimes quite inspired. <br /> <br />Why then only three stars? - Simply because the viewer cannot help themselves playing spot the rip-off here every ten minutes or so.  <br /> <br />Had I not seen the seven movies I mention above (and I'm convinced Wimmer must have studied them intensely), I would give Equilibrium 5 stars easy. <br /> <br /> <br />

B00003CXXS|2.0|What I mean by the title is simple, after reading the books for the first time recently, which are extremely good, I've noticed a lot of left out material from the books that's not in the movies, and Jurassic Park 3 just tries to take those left over scenes and put them into a movie and hope for the best. However the screen-writer did a very poor job, but the director \\"Joe Johnston\\" did well with that lousy script, so don't blame him, blame the screen-writer.  <br /> <br />If you want to get the full effect of Jurassic Park, read the books. This movie itself Isn't great, and the story is really poor, so poor that the director couldn't do anything about it.  <br /> <br />The action is pretty good, you will get pretty much non-stop action once on the island, a few \\"Awe-ing\\" scenes, and fun to watch. <br /> <br />The plot is poor, A kid goes parasailing with a friend of his mother's, gets stranded on Isla Sorna and his divorced parents trick Dr. Grant and his partner Billy into going on a \\"Tour\\" of the island to save their son. The son has been there for two months by himself, yea...right, and is perfectly fine.  <br /> <br />To sum up, the movie is a poor attempt to get the missing material from the two books onto a movie, and a very poor attempt. But is fun to watch, if you don't mind a lousy plot. **/*****

B000062YAZ|4.0|This foursome out of Huntington Beach, California created controversy with their third album Reign in Blood.  In the first song, \\"Angel of Death,\\" there are references to Auschwitz and the horrible things that happened in Nazi death camps.    Not too many people like to hear lyrics like \\"Auschwitz, the meaning of pain\\" and \\"Pumped with fluid inside your brain pressure in your skull begins pushing through your eyes.\\"  Those lyrics combined with atheistic lyrics like \\"For all respect you cannot lust in an invisible man you place your trust\\" and \\"You spend your life just kissing ass (in reference to following what the priest says)\\" in \\"Jesus Saves\\" created protests from mothers all across America.  Despite the controversy, this album does a lot of things never before done in music. <br /> <br />The rest of the music world is going to have to pick up its speed to keep up with Slayer after this album.  Dave Lombardo plays drum beats at insanely fast speeds and keeps the speed up for all 35 minutes of the album.  The guitar method from both Jeff Hanneman and Kerry King match the speedy drums and play guitar riffs so fast their hands must set on fire.  That isn't just the solos; the rhythms of the songs are played so fast they seem like leads in themselves.  The guitar methods and drums sound amazing at the break neck speed, but the vocals do not. <br /> <br />Tom Araya's voice cannot keep up with the drums and guitars and when he tries to it doesn't work out.  For example in \\"Jesus Saves\\" Araya sings so fast that individual words cannot be picked out, with the exception of the two words \\"Jesus saves.\\"   In \\"Reborn\\" Araya tries to keep up with the guitars and sings the lyrics so fast that it is difficult to understand what he is saying.  If the lyrics weren't written in the insert only three words would be understood out of those two songs, \\"Jesus saves\\" and \\"reborn.\\"  Both Kerry King and Jeff Hanneman can play at break neck speeds but they cannot play solos that sound different from one another.  The solos all involve crawling up the neck as fast as they can and then hitting the whammy bar a bunch of times.  That does make for good solos as in \\"Angel of Death\\" when Hanneman holds notes and hits the whammy bar to create screams from the guitar.  It is almost as if he is creating the screams of the people in Nazi death camps. <br /> <br />Slayer found a good formula for a song in \\"Raining Blood.\\"  The formula has fast and complex guitar riffs with drums that keep a fast pace with the double-kick in the bass.  The difference between this song and the other songs on the album is Tom Araya's voice.  He doesn't try to keep up with the beat; instead he sings every syllable and sings clearly.  His slower pace of singing goes well with the fast guitars and drums.  The solos at the end of the song add to the mayhem and help create a good metal song.  The mayhem of the song is also built up with the lyrics: \\"The sky is turning red return to power draws near\\" and \\"Bleeding its horror creating my structure now I shall reign in blood!\\"  The lyrics and guitars make this song one heavy metal song that sums up what heavy metal is all about, anarchy. <br /> <br />Reign in Blood is a metal album that has unbelievably fast songs that influenced other bands of the time such as Metallica.  Metallica tried to create songs faster and harder than the ones found on Reign in Blood, but could not match the speed at which Slayer played.  This album takes listeners in, chews them up and spits them out as completely different people. <br />
B0002I831S|5.0|Paramount is greedy. Look around at any other TV series being released. You will see they are forty plus dollars cheaper for a season. Paramount did not clean this set up from the previous two per DVD disc release a few years ago. What you are mainly getting is more episodes per disc and a compact box. I am aggravated because I bought the entire series on DVD when it was two per disc. They took up three shelves of my bookcase. fan of saving space since I buy lots of DVDs I would have preferred to have had the set like this. I don't see any improvement in the quality of this set over my set. Fans that didn't buy the previous set will want this set even though Paramount as usual is asking to much for a series. I have been watching all Star Trek series since the their first telecast in the sixties and I love them. I just wish they had a studio like MGM selling the DVDs. Fans of Stargate SG-1 know like me that it is a great series.  MGM only charges about fifty-two dollars for a season. I only wish this set was that reasonably priced. The plastic box this Star Trek set comes in is nice and it takes up very little space. Several extras come with this set, so if you don't have this set yet, get it.
B00004XMV6|5.0|Laughably self-indulgent (heck, maybe that's the point), 9 1/2 WEEKS is actually so bad it isn't even so bad it's good.  Mickey Rourke's character stands around (and sits, and stands around some more), leering and smirking a lot like a young, superbadass Bruce Willis; Kim Basinger's character ups the stupidity quotient just a little too high for the Smirker's good.  At least she wises up and leaves the guy in the end:  the only surprise is that it took her so long to get to that point.  Oh well, the film had to end somehow.  Talk about vicarious thrills.  Disturbing?  Yeah, right.  Titillating?  Uh, no.  Erotic?  Hardly.  Innovative?  So was sliced bread, and bread takes longer to stale than this turgid turkey.  If I've ruined the ending for you, consider yourself lucky.  Rent the sequel and get what you think you deserve.
B0002IQHY8|2.0|I expected better from Parsons after 5 years. A few are pretty good, but overall, not as good as any of his others. The best one is his own remake of \\"The Raven\\".
B00000FC5H|5.0|It's got all the hits and more all right, and so, so fine they are.  The remastering is absolutely awesome - - crank up 'September' any time of the year and you're guaranteed to get gone.  It isn't chronological - - the earliest track, 'Kalimba Story', comes smack in the middle - - but this is a party, not a history lesson.  I could do without 'Boogie Wonderland' myself but you can't not have everything, and I don't want to spoil the party so I'll go nitpick on someone else.  Awesome, wonderful.
B00005JN7O|1.0|This movie wasn't worth the $4 1st showing admission, not to mention the popcorn and candy price. It was slow, unimaginative and oh so booooring.  The stone characters wandered around the contrived sets like mice in a maze looking for their million dollar pay checks at the end. There was no dialog to speak of, character development was a no show, and the story, well, it sure could have been a whole lot better. Don't waste your money.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I was shown the pilot episode(s) by a friend and went immediately to the store to buy the DVD collection for myself.  I found it hard to understand how this show could have been cancelled before it's first season was up.  Witty dialog, rich characters, and superb acting make this a gem of a show. Furthermore, Whedon's decision to build the Serenity interior as a continuous interconnected series of sets is genius, and adds so much to the flow of the ship environment.  I am an avid sci-fi /fantasy fan, but I do not mindlessly support a show just because it has a space ship and a few laser pistols... This is just good writing.  This show could have been set in any venue and it would have still been great.  (but then, Asimov once said that good science fiction has a great human story at it's core).<br /><br />The only thing wrong with this show is that it died too soon.

0393035158|5.0|Harris's book, THE END OF FAITH, is a masterpiece of clear and engaging writing about a topic that will destroy us all unless we come to understand it.  We know the benefits of faith -- peace and quiet among those with whom we share it.  In the wider world, however, we find no single faith to share except faith in our ability to discover, to learn, to grow.  Science seeks to learn our errors and cure our ignorance, but blind faith seeks to avoid learning and preserve our ignorance.  Harris relates our failure to rise above blind faith to many of the terrible wrongs of the modern world including most especially the acts and policies of the present US admisitration.  His skill with language produces many quotable insights: \\"Faith,\\" he writes on p. 65, \\"is what creduility becomes when it finally achieves escape velocity from the contraints of terrestrial discourse -- constraints like reasonableness, internal coherence, civility, and candor.\\"  The book contains an extended bibliography and 63 pages of footnotes which are in themselves an excellent book.
0812932293|3.0|I have to agree with several other readers.  Sir Branson articulates himself to be a born entrepreneur, risk-taker (sometimes calculated, other times not), iconoclastic and, perhaps subtlely, family-centered.<br /><br />Unfortunately, his vivid descriptions of his variegated love life and only tangential discussion of his personal life philosophy and philanthropic work, leaves one saying  \\"He's an  exciting, flamboyant character; but not someone who will be remembered in the manner of a Carnegie or Rockefeller\\".<br /><br />Whenever I read and review biographies, I try to encapsulate key takeaways--relevant teaching points--for  future benefit. I present them below in the hope that they might be beneficial to someone:<br /><br />-A tight knit social circle of family and friends is critical; the wealthier and more successful one becomes, the tighter and more important this circle should be<br /><br />-JVs (Joint Ventures) can be a valuable way of expeditiously creating new business lines in an unfamiliar industry or environment<br /><br />-European banks are far more conservative/less risk-taking than American ones (rather well known)<br /><br />-Sub-units managed as individual corporate entities are an effective way of hedging risk and building employee buy-in<br /><br />-Put employees first (vs. shareholders) and profits to owners/shareholders will dutifully follow<br /><br />Overall, I am pleased that I read this book because I enjoy Virgin's services (particularly Virgin Airways).  Branson's adeptness at branding is unquestionable.  However, I came away with the feeling one often has after completing a meal at a much hyped restaurant yet not having had one's appetite pleasurably satisfied.

0743454529|1.0|This was an EXCELLENT idea for a book but the writing was not the greatest and the ending was a total cop out. What a shame to let such a great idea fall short like this. I mean one son is an arsonist and by the end of the book he is a total hero and with no explanation??? Author needs to work on her inability to flesh out a story so it is at the very least vaguely believable!
B0000AFX64|5.0|I don't consider myself to be a science fiction fan but I bought this for my kids while I was shopping and they loved it. So did I. This is much better than I expected it to be since I don't reguarly care for sci fi. The characters are the main selling point for me and there's a lot of heart and humor. This is a charming and fun movie with plenty of adventure, drama, and food for thought too. Good family entertainment that can lead to all types of great discussions about mythology, the stars, and more.
B0002NRRAG|5.0|How true!  Musicians take a lifetime to prepare their first CD, then are expected to have an equally brilliant release in a few months.  The process rarely works.  Rarer is an artist so dedicated to quality that eight years passes between a highly acclaimed debut and sophmore CD.  Even more unusual is the artist who scores perfectly both times, so far apart.  <br /> <br />Then again, nobody with ears could call Madeleine Peyroux typical.  She's a genuine gem amongst the clutter composing  today's musical spectrum.  Thank goodness she's faithful to her remarkable vocal stylings. <br /> <br />Talent aplenty, Ms. Peyroux's voice and delivery strike your memory in familiar ways.  Comparison to world-famous blues and jazz females are tempting, perhaps justified.  Nonetheless, Ms. Peyroux's never derivative but rather refreshingly comfortable in an all-new manner. <br /> <br />Ms. Peyroux also has smarts enough to work superb material.  She easily intreprets standards by such great tunesmiths as Leonard Cohen, Bob Dylan, Hank Williams, and W.C. Handy into her own repetoire.  She ain't a bad writer herself. <br /> <br />Ms. Peyroux invested time wisely since her 1996 introduction.  Hope we don't have to wait as long for her next CD, but surely I'm willing to if it takes that long for another perfect CD. <br /> <br />The title of the closing track precisely sums it all up: \\"This Is Heaven To Me!\\"
0679731377|4.0|This was one of my favourite books of the year. It is often difficult to decipher exactly what Julian Barnes is getting at in his writing as he likes to present a detatched, intellectual view of the world with many different points of view incorporated in his immaculately constructed prose. A History of the World is, in essence, a series of essays describing various dispirate angles of history from the little man's perspective. Never is this done better than in chapter one, a brilliant and original short story describing the voyage of Noah's ark from the mouth of a stowaway woodworm.<br /><br />Other parts I enjoyed was the short chapter on love, an exemplary piece of prose that can only come from the mind of a great thinker who has pondered deeply what it is to be in love. Three superb short stories deconstructing the myth of Jonah and the whale, a comic tale of a Titanic survivor and a ship carrying Jewish refugees on a futile voyage around the States were particularly memorable in different ways. And for a prime example of the pure intellectual strand of Barnes' writing, sample his essay on art history concerning a portrait of 'The sinking of the Medusa'. You will never pass by a picture with a cursory glance again.<br /><br />I am aware that Barnes insists this work is a novel, claiming that 'things in it thicken and deepen' but I think it is essentially a collection of original and thought provoking essays. A worms eye view of history.
B00005RHGK|4.0|I have watched this movie over and over and continue to enjoy it as much as the first time I saw it.  The opening scene with Trish and Derry bantering back and forth on their drive home  is a masterful one.  What seems to be a comical engagement between a teen brother and sister takes on a sinsiter backdrop  when that vacation camper pulls off the highway and clears the path for the star of the show. What at first is a tiny blur on the back screen quickly looms to reveal a real terror. The whole scene has a Hitchcock feel to it as it sets the stage for the events that follow.  The revelation of the demon and the horrors he brings with him is gradual and the visions of him are not overdone.  He earns his reputation as the \\"Creeper\\".  There are excellent stunts in this film, as the demon shows up in dark and eerily lit places.  The scenes are atmospheric, memorable and fun to watch.  The demon has wings and this trait is used well in this film.  The predictable finale at the police station is the only detraction, but I really liked the brother and sister role reversal. Not the typical. Great to watch in widescreen.  A must see and a must have!  <br />

B000053V7Q|5.0|Like Richard Pryor, the talents of Elvis Presley were seen to best cinematic advantage in his concert films. \\"That's the Way It Is\\" (1970) shows a vibrant, charismatic and humorous Elvis that his fictional movies simply could not capture. This excellent documentary also reveals a masterful performer at the peak of his powers, which was not the case in \\"Elvis on Tour\\" (1972). Presley was a spontaneous, imaginative artist who worked better in concert arenas than on movie soundstages. \\"That's the Way It Is\\" proves this strength for all to see.
B00028HBKM|1.0|We should all actually be grateful to Mel Gibson for making this nasty little horror as all he is doing is stating explicitly the horrors that lie within Christianity. The idea that salvation depends on God dying is absurd, immoral and sadomasochistic. <br />
B00004Y6O9|5.0|It was the late 70's and unless you lived through it, it may be kind of hard to understand. Disco ruled the radio, you couldn't turn the dial without finding the latest and greatest by the Bee Gees or The Village People. The term \\"Rock\\" was now assigned to bands like Styx or Supertramp. The guitar driven rock of Led Zep, The Who and Kiss, were pushed to the back-burner of the American music scene. Then out of nowhere Van Halen burst onto the scene. With the opening chords of \\"Runnin' With The Devil\\" into \\"Eruption\\" and \\"You Really Got Me\\", Van Halen cemented the new American rock sound. No matter what era of Van Halen you prefer, DLR vs. Sammy, it's impossible to top the band's debut album. This was something new, something purely American, and opened the door to what we know as Hard Rock or Heavy Metal today. It's impossible to listen to any rock artist today and not hear the influence of Van Halen. The 80's hair-metal scene was basically made up of bands immitating this album. Is it coincidence that soon after Van Halen debuted disco died, and bands like Twisted Sister emerged? Why bother reviewing the songs on this disk, unless you have lived under a rock for the last 25+ years you have heard each of the songs on this album at one point or another? These songs are classics, and have stood the test of time. I have owned this album on vinyl, 8-Track, cassette and CD. If you don't own this disk already.....well what are you waiting for. Like The Beatles \\"Sgt. Pepper\\", or AC/DC's \\"Highway to Hell\\" and Pink Floyd's \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\", \\"Van Halen\\" is an essenital album for your cd collection.
0802130208|2.0|I have to agree with P.J. Otto of St.Louis on this one. What is the author trying to tell us; that fat, eccentric, neurotic personality-disordered individuals are funny?  A sociological lession? Political satire? <br /> <br />Much of the dialogue is clever but redundant.  It becomes predictable after a few pages. Ignitius is never personalized. Throughout the book he remains a character construct.  A hyperbolized combination of responses. <br /> <br />If there is a great humanizing message here, it is inapprehendable by me. Without a redeeming message, the story is too quirky and uninteresting. <br /> <br />A book that is overrated by virtue of too many people propelled by the momentum of a desire to see what has been seen by others.
B0000C9V3T|4.0|After seeing Kill Bill Vol. 2, I made it a case and point to buy the soundtrack, only to realize the soundtracks were cut into two seperated cds.  So thus, I went on and bought Kill Bill Vol. 1's soundtrack first. <br /> <br />I've been a very happy girl ever since. <br /> <br />There are definately songs that will leaving you humming for a few days, if not weeks, after you first here them: <br /> <br />1. Bang, Bang 5/5  <br />While it may be a shorter track, it definately reflects the mood of the beginning of the movie in sorts. All and all, a rather nice song. <br /> <br />2. That Certain Female 2/5 <br />Not exactly one of my favorites tracks... <br /> <br />3. The Grand Duel (Parte Prima) 6/5 <br />This is, in my opinion, the best track on the album...or rather both albums. It's a beautiful piece of music and just sets a mood...a rather somber, sad mood, but can still be \\"up beat\\" enough to listen to. (To me) It definately goes great with the part when it's played.  I get shivers ever single time I hear it and love to hum the melody. It's just...wow... Definately worth buying the soundtrack for... <br /> <br />4. Twisted Nerve 5/5 <br />Another short be excellent song.  Haunting is a good word to describe this track. The whistling was excellent and the music that accompanies it later sets the mood. Another one of my favorites, to say the least. For those of you that bought the first KB Vol. 1 DVD, this is the song that is played when you first get to the select screen. <br /> <br />5. Queen of the Crime Council 2/5 <br />Funnier to watch then hear when this is being said...exactly not really cause at the end, it just makes you raise an eyebrow...it sounds so weird and really needed to be said differently... <br /> <br />6. Ode to Oren Ishii 3/5 <br />I didn't care for this one too much. <br /> <br />7. Run Fay Fun 4/5 <br />Hey, I liked it.... <br /> <br />8. Green Hornet 5/5 <br />Think of Flight of the Bumblebee, only with a little spark to and \\"fun\\".  And even if you're not too fond of Flight of the Bumblebee...dont' turn your nose at this track.  It's still listen worthy. <br /> <br />9. Battle Without Honor or Humanity 6/5 <br />An awsome track, espically the beginning.  Definately a song you'll want to listen to.  Again, a great reason to by this soundtrack. The music heard in one of the trailers...which is awsome because most good songs heard in trailers aren't offered on the soundtrack. <br /> <br />10. Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood 4/5 <br />All and all, a good soundtrack. I'm...rather found of clapping to the beginning as well...;) <br /> <br />11. Woo Hoo 4/5 <br />Though it does sound better on the movie, I just like saying \\"Woo-Hoo, Woo wo Hoo...\\" Still, good song. <br /> <br />12. Crane-White Lightning 2/5 <br />Um...no.  Avoid most RZA tracks.  I mean really...AVOID them...(There's only four, thank goodness...) <br /> <br />13. The Flower of Carnage 6/5 <br />A beautiful song.  Definately worth your listening pleasure. <br /> <br />14. You're My Wicked Life 4/5 <br />Even though this is another dialogue track, I just like the sound of David Carradine's voice... <br /> <br />There are seven more tracks to the soundtrack but I'm deciding to stop at fourteen. The other tracks are rather good as well however. <br /> <br />All and all, give buying this soundtrack a serious thought.  There are definately some tracks worth buying it for.
B0002T7ZKW|5.0|well first of all i duno wat \\"fiftybucks\\" is on but i think u have ur lyrics stuffed and u hav anger problems.  I don't know when i have heard billie-joe being nasty to women in their songs.  Anyway wouldnt life be boring if everyone was the same. <br /> <br />\\"Chim-Chim\\" the lyrics are when u look at the full line.. \\"And can u hear the sounds of hysteria, the sublyminal mind f**k America.\\"  It isnt even \\"my F**king America\\" so getting it right in the first place wouldbe good.  and whats wrong with a one swear word in a song. its called freedom of speech. <br /> <br />\\"Jer\\" and \\"Greggor\\" at least u can give sum constructive critism in your reviews.  I see where you are coming from in your reviews and at least u think about your review and dont just slag em and not really explain why u r. <br /> <br />Anyway i wouldnt have written this review if not for these slagging reviews.  So I reckon it is a catchy song. Good Film Clip, may get repetitive but apart from that i'm hooked.  The album will have better. <br /> <br />Cheers
0764574124|5.0|When all is said and done, John Walkenbach only has three things going for him:<br /><br />One, he really knows what he is talking about. While this is a For Dummies book, and doesn't go down really into the Power Programming (that's another of his books) level, they couldn't have gotten a more knowledgeable person to write it. You can take what he says in the book (or on the books companion web site just in case a typo made it through the editing system) as something handed down on stone tablets.<br /><br />Second, he really knows how to convey the information he has. I find his writing style to be well laid out, informative, almost a pleasure to read (true pleasure I associate with good Science Fiction, not any computer book).<br /><br />Third, he really seems to be a nice guy. While I've never met him, the home page on his web site (given at the very beginning of the book) has a has a link - Send e-mail to John Walkenbach. On a couple of occassions, I've had a reason to send him an e-mail asking a question. He's answered promptly, curteously and save me a whole bunch of time.<br /><br />If you want a quick and rapid introduction to macros or VBA programming (in Excel these are the same thing), something that will get you started, this is an excellent choice. As you become a power user, buy his Power Programming with VBA book, and indeed his other Excel books.
B00007M5CO|5.0|If you're celebrating your aniversary, with a sensual supper, charming wine and sugestive clothing, then BFTC should be the music you play on your cd player. Don't spect the three-minute clasic tango. Instead, a rarely sensual electronic music will lead you into sensitive experiences where the sound of an almost forgotten yet contemporary \\"bandoneon\\" reminds you of a warm, bussy, delightful and attonishing night in Buenos Aires. Looking for an original lounge atmosphere? Then do not think it twice, otherwise it might be sold out.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|First of all, I found the movie to be very entertaining.  I love the cinematography, dialogue, acting, characters, and especially the scenes of Tokyo.  By just seeing this film I now have a strong desire to visit Japan.  And of course I thought the soundtrack was absolute perfection...My Bloody Valentine, Phoenix, Jesus and Mary Chain...awesome stuff. <br /> <br />I found the central theme of the movie to be a very truthful representation of many people living in our time.  I believe that the main characters being in a foreign country with a foreign language was a way of showing that they felt like foreigners in general.  They didn't understand why they were alive.  They were looking for answers but not really doing a great job of finding the answers.  They are not heroes.  They are regular people struggling to understand their place in the world.  The fact that they are trying at all to find the answers is encouraging to me.  Most films do not even bring up the question of our purpose in living.  \\"Lost in Translation\\" asks the big questions.  In that way I would compare it to \\"Magnolia\\", \\"The Thin Red Line\\" and \\"Adaptation\\".       <br /> <br />Of course the film also takes a close look at marriage and romance.  We see the obvious mistakes that they both make (especially Bill Murray's character).  Because the movie does not present them as examples I am not bothered by this.  When he sleeps with the singer the casual sex is in no way presented as a positive.  The movie both shows him as feeling ashamed and just plain stupid.  The innocence of Scarlett Johansen's character only brings this feeling out even more strongly in him.   <br /> <br />The fact that the two never actually have any sexual encounter also shows that their relationship is not about romance.  This makes the movie totally outside of the norm in most Hollywood films.  Usually sexual desire is something you automatically follow.  \\"Lost in Translation\\" shows the negative effects of adultery.  Murray and Johansen never have sex though.  They are both seeking answers.  They find some encouragement from each other.  It seems clear to me that Johansen's character is especially encouraged to love her husband more than ever once he returns.  I think she understands that neither of them are perfect and that's ok.  Even Bill Murray's character seems inspired to go on with life through his experiences in Tokyo. <br /> <br />I could go on even further with this movie.  I could talk about Scarlett Johansen's longing to be loved and admired for her beauty (her karaoke song is just one example of this).  I don't think that is a wrong desire either.  Bill Murray has the desire to teach, to share, and to laugh.  The key to the movie is both are seekers, not examples.  If you look at the movie that way there is a power just because they are seeking and don't look for the answers in having sex with each other or some superficial answer like that.  \\"Lost in Translation\\" asks the big question about why we are alive.  What is our purpose?  The movie doesn't completely answer the question but it gets the viewer going in the right direction. <br /> <br />There you go.  There is no clear cut answer at the end of the film.  But that is because people in general don't know the answer to the question.  The movie is about seeking the truth.  And I love it! <br />
B00028HBKM|2.0|It took me till August of 2004 to watch The Passion Of Christ. I didn't think I could watch Christ so bruttaly tortuted. Then! I watched and just shook my head.  <br /> <br />I read this somewhere and could not have said it any better.  <br /> <br />\\"This movie expends so much energy portraying the wounds and innocent suffering of Jesus that the real climax of the Christian story -- the resurrection of Christ--all but evaporates from the screen. The movie drives so inexorably toward convincing us of the brutality of Jesus' death that nothing is left over when the resurrection comes. A deflated burial cloth, a new face, free from bloody bruises, a step out into the light.\\"  <br /> <br />The Only part of the movie that was even believable was parts of the actual Crucification. And what's up with the Devil being a woman? <br /> <br />\\"Jesus Of Nazareth,\\"  gets my vote for the BEST movie on the BIRTH, LIFE, DEATH & RESSURECTION OF JESUS.
B00028HBKM|2.0|When I first watched the Passion in the theaters, about a month after it was first released (!!), I wasn't really impressed with anything in it. From all the hype, it sounded like it would be a gore-fest. I'll admit it was gory, but not nearly as gory as I was hoping.  <br /> <br />I went to see it a second time with one of my friends and I ended up laughing through most of the movie. Not at the movie, which was no longer interesting, but at the audience. Listening to those lunatics is hilarious. I was sitting next to some old lady and I thought she was going to have a stroke by the end of the film. <br /> <br />Maybe today's youth has been a little desensatized by TV and whatnot or maybe today's older population is just a bunch of pansies. Who knows?
B000002GJ7|5.0|Wow, over 14 years since it's release and still one of the best CD's I've ever bought.  From the rocking \\"Decedence Dance\\", and \\"Get the Funk Out\\", to \\"More than Words\\" and \\"Hole Hearted\\", this CD is one great song after another.  They show great range on this album, Ballads, hard-rocking tunes, a jazz lounge-type ballad they can do it all.  They can do rock as fun like with \\"Susie (Wants Her All Day What?), or with a message like in \\"Song For Love\\".  Gary Cherone has a great vocal range (too bad he'll only be remembered for MTW and being the forgotten 3rd lead singer for Van Halen), and Nuno Bettencourt has to be one of the greatest guitar players I've even heard.  Like another reviewer one of my true regrets is never being able to see them live.  Pick up this album, it's sure to please!!!
