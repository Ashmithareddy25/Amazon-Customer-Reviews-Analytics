B009J6AAGU|5|I've been using ozium for a very long time. No matter what they say on the labels, the scent is different.<br /><br />It is not the faint citrus smell I've come to know over the last 20+ years. It now has a chemical smell like a cheap air freshener.<br /><br />It's still great at killing other odors and wiping away a night's worth of cigar smoke after poker night. But now it smells like a school science lab.<br /><br />BTW, Target sells the 3.5 oz (new) regular scent for 4.50. -5% if you use a target visa card.
B003TTL0TE|5|I wash my car twelve months out of the year....and this is one hell of a good wash mit!
B0002JMIEK|5|super great

B002VVGPE6|5|Easy to install, looks good and works like klock said it would.
B00K1PGX4Q|4|Does what it's suppose to.. Would recommend getting 2in blocks for the back if you want the whole truck level.
B00B2YE4B4|5|Nice way to brighten up the inside of your car.  These are as white as they get, helps to light up even the darkest of corners in you vehicle (and the surroundings outside a bit as well lol.
B00IUE5OCC|5|Great stuff.
B00FS66GOU|5|Great product
B000JQQQKS|1|These are very weak and some of them stayed stretched out and would not retract, only the blue ones are worth anything, the others are no good, the hooks are flimsy and if connecting them to anything the rubber tips come off, very disappointing.
B000E7H3TU|5|This is another excellent K & N product that performs as advertised. Very easy to install, I used it on my 2014 Honda Foreman.
B0034ZYE5U|5|Love this  quiet , very powerful
B00Z0ISR0M|5|This helps keeping bags from flying around the truck. I keep it attacked to the 2 far back hooks, so whenever I need it I pull it to the from, cover, attach to the front hooks.
B0081TQ9PW|5|Works and looks good
B006QYPSCO|5|Factory part looks cool. Easy to align the TRD emblem once cap screwed on tight.

B00QSNZPJO|5|I have a 2006 Scion xb.<br />there is a  Toyota net sold to go with my car that sells  in  the $31 - $35 range.<br />I saw this at less than half the price of that one and decided to try it out.<br />It does a nice job of keeping things from moving around and  also from falling  out when i open the rear hatch!<br />I added  Carabiner Snap Hooks to my net  to have a secure hold onto the Scion rings in my car.<br /><br />It is a great fit and I saved  me  money too.<br /><br />i would buy this item again<br /><br />:)
B003VAREMS|5|great product
B00A7WIVNE|5|It was a a piece of cake to install and looks great. Not sure why there are reviews on here saying it was so hard to do. An x-acto knife made cutting the blanks out a simple task. My only complaint is, &#34;come on Rugged Ridge, throw in a couple clips to hold it in place&#34;!!!!<br />I would also prefer that all the light switches were the same color. Other than that, good item.
B00062ZJ4O|1|didn't get the scratch out
B000GKD5NI|4|Fits my 08 Corolla perfect. Went up and is still in place.
B00H0H3M3I|4|I'm giving this product a 4 simply because of outstanding customer service. The Chrysler logo came off within a day and the carbeyondstore quickly shipped out another set. I'd come back to the store again, but probably for another product.
B004PL87JQ|5|Very happy
B007PUPGYS|5|as advertised had to be programmed
B001FEOSPS|5|Awesome!!! Super easy bolt on installation and worked flawlessly.

B00Q74MMIG|5|Good price and easy to install.
B002Z645TO|5|Great purchase to protect your RV tires from sun while sitting.
B00CGTVCIC|5|Very nice cover.  Fits much tighter then my last cover, and feels 100x better.  If you don't think it will fit around your wheel, TRY HARDER!  it's a very snug fit...which is what it should be.
B00SNQ544K|2|The company was great at customer service, I just am not happy with the item. The material is cheap and my head was spinning trying to put the back seat covers on. It's so difficult. Ultimately i'm returning the item.
B00M9CAWSC|5|I paid the right price for what I got
B000BYGE3M|5|Nice wiper blades, doing a great job.
B002UC1906|5|Fits great<br />Item came as described
B008B3UU94|5|Fast delivery and easy to install. A must have for your Jeep!
B008FPTWR4|5|Worked perfectly
B001EOWQ5I|5|Good product.  Works, easy to install.  Buy some Honda Interior Trim Push-Type Clips, you might need them, because installation of this connector will often result in broken clips.
B000CB2N4S|4|Good quality.
B00959M7R6|4|Was surprised that it was chrome plated plastic.  But, it works and looks fine.
B000E4U1CY|5|good fit
B00NMQJTR4|5|Put this on my 2011 FLHTK about a year ago. I noticed the performance change right away. It has been flawless and just flat out Bad Ass!
B008KKC7YE|5|I've had KYB shocks on my 68 mustang for 20 years and I highly recommend them. This particular model was for my 74 roadrunner and I'm very pleased.
B004C6OBBC|4|Perfect other than the fact the pin I received would not fit in the hole.  I had to use a drill to drill out one side.  It was as if the hole was tapered or had excess material in the end.  I would have given 5 stars had I not had to do the extra work to make it work.
B00SDMJLQ6|3|nice but didn't fit my car
B001J8U1H4|4|Good and sturdy mat.  Was definitely genuine BMW mat.  Only flaw is that the holes in the mat do not match up with my 2005 Z4 floor hooks.  Good quality other than that.
B00ATC9UZK|1|The smell remains for only couple of days
B000I2114Y|2|Could not use for radiator bug screen . Our new Nissan Rogue had no places to attach the strings to hold it in place--- disappointing
B00CMX20H4|5|very loud horn very very pleased with it would recommend to anyone who rides a motorcycle
B00UY2COP8|1|Poor Quality. First item had bright laser, and one dim one. Got a replacement, that one started off with 2 bright lasers, then after a couple days, both lasers were dim. Tried battery and a/c power, same problem. The product worked well when lasers were bright.
B0058X0GE4|5|Just a simple review, I watched the video on YouTube READ ALL the directions, the kit went together just fine, started in the shade and then moved to the sun once star was filled and clear film was on. and it worked perfectly on my Nickle size star. Not sure why so many are having problems.
B00IEJSU74|5|worked
B001GS15Q8|5|Good product for my VTX 1300 S..
B0002UQATS|5|Best wax for black paint
B00FOX56H0|4|This harness worked great. It didn't come with instructions. I had to call kensun to speak to a representitive. They were very helpful and sent me an email with a wiring diagram. I would have given it 5 stars if it had a wiring diagram.
B00FH8P1DG|4|Lightbar looks great & is very bright but got moisture in it literally the first day. Going to have to open it, clean it & re seal it.. Very disappointed about that but you get what you paid for.
B00BN450H0|1|Crappy quality. The black part is flaking off in less than a week, and looks like the whole black section is about to slide off the fob. Look else ware.
B00URUIKAK|5|As far as application goes, I never expected a product like this to be so easy to cut and move. With a little pressure, one stroke with a sharp utility knife did the trick 90% of the time. The stuff is very flexible and adheres quickly. I got 18sqft of this butyl based deadener for $35 shipped. I think that says something by itself. I have just finished applying the product to my trunk lid, floor, and rear deck along with a little bit in the front doors. 15sqft for the whole trunk is pretty conservative as I have a larger Toyota Avalon. I did a before and after tap test and the trunk sounds solid. No change on the doors though with roughly 1.5 square feet on each door inner skin. I was very conservative and did not double layer much of anything. I got about 75% of the rear deck and trunk lid covered and put the last 2 sheets down in the spare tire well. Again, only hitting the big, easy to reach areas. My goals with this were mainly to stop a few bad trunk rattles. (Who knew one 12&#34; sub could do so much damage :) )  and also, as a second priority, to reduce panel resonance near the door speakers. Update 1: Next day.  So I got up this morning and at a reasonable hour I started the car and Slammed it. No difference with the sound of the speakers but I didn't really listen at them very closely. It didn't stop any of the trunk rattles. HOWEVER, it did make them less pronounced. All the same rattles were still there, they are just quieter now. You mainly hear bass on the outside now which gives me a little piece of mind. It sounds more, uh, legitimate now and less annoying. If I hear a car going down the street with heavy bass going on with no rattles it sounds pretty nice. Here's the big surprise... It made MORE difference on the INSIDE than on the OUTSIDE. This is my first time using vibration dampers inside a car. The bass... Hits... like Kicks... WAY harder and sounds cleaner. I must've gained like 3-4 db inside the vehicle. The lows are way more powerful and I feel more bass. It's not just louder but it actually gave the subwoofer more dynamic range. Like I said, it hits harder now. Every time the kick drum hits less of that energy is getting pushed into panels in the back of the car. All the bass is coming back up front to me instead of staying in the trunk panels. I LIIIIKE It. If only I would've tried this sooner. This made a considerable difference in how the bass sounds on the inside. Considerable.  I will absolutely buy more of this in the future, I think a second layer might be in order, things do still vibrate, and if it makes the bass inside that much louder again I'd rather do this again than buy another sub or something.
B00AZABHLQ|5|I was able to remove and replace the front bearings on my Camry with this tool.  It was easy, did not damage bearing during installation, and I saved a lot of money performing this task myself.  Could not have done it without this tool.
B00R9HGN80|3|Good
B001BDWOL8|5|Great deal best price ever
B00080QHMM|5|Easy to use.
B005MZWN6M|5|works as described so far, easy to open and close have to put it through the test of time
B006TMNZSM|5|perfect
B00LRSP55Y|5|Just what I needed
B00XZ9OKAY|5|I have many elderly retirees in my neighborhood living on a fixed income. They just couldn't afford the prices that the factory charged for new remotes. So I ordered these for them and they work perfectly. The programming instructions were spot on. They are very pleased!
B00JJ5H5VE|1|its dosent even fit on the tire... yes i ordered the right size dot it ended up ripping on the side im going to take it to a seat cover shop to see if they can fix it and make it fit
B00029WVHY|5|Perfect for offices where your back faces the door.
B00AJV4R3G|3|Should come in packs of 2 not 1
B00RUETX4S|5|Awesome ! thanks
B00CQBXFYE|5|Awesome price here!  They are the full set of brake pads for the Rocket 3.  Just put on the first set (2 in front, 1 in back).  Works great!
B0001WW37U|5|It is good . I like it.
B000BOAZM8|5|I’m swapping engines on my 1990 Chevy K2500 350 5.7L and needed to replace the exhaust from the engine to the muffler… the rest was replaced not too long ago. I was hoping that it would be an easy 3” ID into a 3” OD and I was wrong. The Walker 15034 converter I was installing had a 3” ID on both ends which was fine for the exhaust pipe from the manifold but that left me with my Dynomax 42606 connector pipe slipping into the converter rather than the other way around… the connector pipe was needed to make up the difference with the shorter length of the converter to what was there previously. I tried SmartParts 300300 3&#34; lap joint on the Walker exhaust side but the pipe was thick and it wouldn’t work get a tight fit so I cut a 5-inch length of pipe to slip in as a nipple; added some Permatex 80335 Sealer; butted the pipes together; and then installed the clamp again and all is good. I had to cut four slits into the converter and use a compression clamp on the engine side. I used the SmartParts 320300 3&#34; lap joint but on the extension pipe to the muffler and that was easy. My first time using this type of clamp and it was a mistake not trying them earlier. I couldn’t get the old converter off the Walker 44461 Extension Pipe so I ended up have to cut it and it was buggered that I ended up replacing it because I couldn’t get a new pipe far enough into it to prevent it from leaking… the old clamp had made an indentation on the top that prevented the pipe from going all the way. Good news is if I ever need to pull it apart connectors that don’t distort the pipes will make it easy. Since this was all one pain in the butt project the review is for everything I used. Everything was a quality product I have to go with 5-stars for them all. However, not all clamps fit 3” ID pipe like that on my converter, especially those from SmartParts, but the Dynomax 35794 3” clamps were a perfect fit. I cut slits in the pipe to get a better compression but a little torque would have worked but might have made the pipe bend and be difficult to impossible to get off if ever needed. Welding just wasn’t an option for me.ve worked but might have made the pipe bend and be difficult to impossible to get off if ever needed. Welding just wasn’t an option for me.
B00A2I2OEU|5|worked like a charm
B00UJ947II|5|These fit perfectly to my scooter and I would advise anyone that these are high quality at an affordable price, so please buy these. These are extremely stylish and make my scooter look even better than it already did. The black color looked expensively done, is shiny, and you can tell time and effort was put into the finish. It looks like $100 worth, but I paid only $47,95. I've bought things for my scooter before that didn't come complete and I needed to purchase other items, so I was happy these came with everything I needed to attach them to the scooter.<br />There was a very quick delivery here and the item was well packaged, with the seller providing a five-star customer service. Could not ask for more from an Amazon purchase. Thank you for the service; it was second to none. I look forward to more purchases from you in the future. GOOFIT Completed Cylinder Head is one amazing buy.
B00K1C1WC2|5|Very light but fits firmly against the wheels.  I had used boards in the past and had my camper move a couple of times.  I don't see how it can move with these.
B00MA7744G|5|Good for the price
B000EBICHI|3|Not as much cushion as I expected.
B00CHRVZYE|1|It did not work at all I even had to pay the dealership to program it and they could not get it to work it was a waste off money.
B000C44CUI|3|Good shocks only problem is i lowered my nissan hardbody using drop spindles because i didn't want a bumpy ride,  like some people do when the drop their trucks by either cutting springs or by torsion bars. That also cambers the wheels in and the tread wears quickly. But any ways.  These socks still give the truck a bouncy bounce feeling. I mean every bump is felt... i would consider different sjocks for more smoother ride.
B001U2DPUE|5|Great
B0007WQNKC|5|Excellent
B0009OMYAQ|5|One of those tools that you should just get. The 2.4 Ecotec has the oil filter cap somewhat hidden, and you basically either need this socket, crowfoot sockets, or pliers, because you aren't gonna get it with sockets (even with u-joints or wobbles), wrenches (unless they're specialty offset), or crowfoots. I still had to use a u-joint with this socket, so it would be difficult to get the right fit otherwise. Definitely worth the price for the frustration it saves.
B0052SF0LO|5|The first one came but it only worked for three days.  Amazon customer service was amazing and it was immediately replaced.  I've waited a while to post this to be sure that the replacement works.  It does, so I'm ordering another today<br /><br />Love that I can turn it on manually (when I barbeque at night)
B000F38GVC|4|Much better than the cheaper original version. Fits decent considering all the compound curves on the dash. I was impressed how well it fit the passenger side and built in cup holders.  However if they had spent a little more time on the R&D for this particular model and not relied so heavily on velcro to help it fit, it wouldve been a 5 star product.
B00471RMW2|5|my mom loves it
B004LF1U5O|5|I was constantly losing my rear brake when coming down a long twisty downhill that lasted several miles at high speed. I had added reservoirs for the rear master cylinder and for the caliper (STR) and had added a heat sink on the rear caliper. I still would lose the rear brake on this section from overheating if I was not really easy on it...Decided to try the RBF 660 and I did not lose the rear brake on the trouble section last time I rode and had no fading otherwise during the ride so it appears I may have finally licked the problem. Bike is a 2011 KTM XCW-300.
B0067PUMXW|5|Easy to apply to car window. Great for the zombie hunter in everyone. Looks great.
B0083CQUT2|5|Killer!
B00RV83UUG|5|Really good light. Installed this on my dad's pickup and the old man can see the dirt roads a whole lot better.
B0006Z9SRA|5|Great wipes and very fast shipping.
B001LQMX3Y|5|Looks very nice, easy to install.  I like it.
B00T3YLLF2|1|Didn't fit right
B003CEJWI2|5|Great quality. Went on easily. Made my car look new. It's amazing what new hub caps can do to a car. Amazing price!!!!!
B000E2AMKC|5|As advertised, K & N hits the mark again with a good product. The workmanship in the filter is excellent. I installed this one on my Honda 2014 Foreman ATV. The fit is snug, but goes on correctly with the same effort as the OEM Honda filter.<br />Let me add.......BE CAREFUL TO ORDER THE CORRECT FILTER for your make and model ATV. It is easy to get it wrong. I almost did.<br />Amazon has a good &#34;Make sure it fits&#34; drop down menu to use.  &#34;USE IT&#34;.
B00W8H4KH2|5|Neat, small but powerful. It works well in jumping a car whrn you need it.
B0031794XI|5|Was a present for my son.  He loved it.
B0093A7VKK|5|Great product!
B00B2AFO4E|5|Good quality easy to install..
B001N2O3PM|5|Looks great on my new car. Needed something with style and elegance to switch out the cheap dealer plastic frame. Glad I made this purchase.
B00OGGSQEQ|1|Took the wiring kit, uninstalled to my electrical-mechanic shop. I asked him to install it. He installed the kit and warned me its a cheaply put together kit and won't last in the long run. I watched him install the wiring harness to my 20inch 126watt light bar. 30 minutes later after everything was properly connected. The lights turned on/off with the harness. After 5 minutes of my light's being on the wire got hot and melted. It ruined the wiring, in line fusible link, and a few other wires. Had to pay $45 for 30 minutes of shop time, and now don't have lights for my light bar and gotta pay more money and more shop time to get another one installed. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone! DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!
B004I0RCS6|1|The Mitsubishi drivers side rear lamp cover came timely and the quality was as advertised, but it did not came with a rubber seal. So, now the cover will leak and the light bulbs will break when it rains. The rubber seal is a small and very inexpensive part, and it should have been included with the order.  I am very unhappy with the added expense,i.e., cost and shipping fees of ordering the seal separately, plus the added time and labor that it will take to do the job right.
B00K9BFRSK|5|Love it !!!!! prefect for my van
B0050Z1554|1|Do not buy this product if you expect it to last more than 6 months!!!  I purchased this car cover in March 2014.  Less than 6 months later, I found a tear in the cover over the car's hood.  I assumed that I had snagged it somehow.  One year later there are holes and tears all over the cover.  The cover is just disintegrating!!!  If I try removing the cover from the car more tears appear.  I will attach more than 1 photo if allowed.  Do not waste your money on this cover.......
B005WGR22Q|3|I was not impressed. It referred to the codes but didn't tell me what the codes were so I had to look it up online.
B003MD3TKK|5|Looks sick af
B000TYOQVQ|4|Perfect fit
B000CSGT64|5|Works perfect using a wix racing PH8A equivilent filter. My old remote filter adapter leaked so I replaced it with this. Very happy, it's made in america too.
B00S7TCI8I|5|This part it's good it fixed the problem on my car thank you Hex parts.
B000GZNEHK|4|Could use more retaining straps to keep the cover on, a few times I've come out to see it half flown off
B000CCFYIE|5|Tool that dies exactly what ist supposed to do.
B00KIGCSRE|5|I had a major problem with the coil springs on my 2014 Ram 2500. I out in a larger anti sway bar and that did nothing to keep my cabover camper from rocking side to side. Once I installed these air bags the problem was immediately solved.
B00192JGA8|5|Just what i wanted, good product
B00KTHY91K|5|good fine thanks
B000BUTDCA|4|Works as advertised.
B00R3ZIEV2|5|This shade fits my '97 K2500 pickup perfectly, and is really easy to install.  It also rolls up nicely with the Velcro strap so it stores easily in the truck when not in use.  The reflective film seems to be of good quality, and it definitely keeps the vehicle cooler when parked in my driveway with the windshield facing South.  I'd definitely recommend it.
B000C9H9HG|5|Good Product Thanks!
B00IT9MBV0|5|Awesome!! Love it!!
B0018EO5AS|4|Great product I should have ordered the 8.5
B001P275YG|5|Perfect replacement for original locks - great price also! I also spoke to a dealer, they wanted 3 times the price and 4-5 business days to order the locks. I got these from Amazon the next day.
B000COB5LM|3|Product arrived in good shape and within 2 days of ordering and matches perfectly to the OEM bracket.  However, the major diameter of the plastic roller is slightly oversize by about .010-.015&#34;, causing a bind on the door latch.<br />To fix this, I polished it over a 3M scotch brite wheel, though in doing so, you must be careful not to get it too hot, or you will melt it.<br />In the future for my other doors of my Ford crew cab, I'll likely just machine some new rollers and utilize the existing brackets.  It would be nice to be able to just buy the rollers, since the brackets that hold them do not need to be replaced.<br />Keep in mind that you'll need a Torx or star drive bit that is a T50 size to remove these from your truck.<br />Even after modifying the rollers slightly, the install was only about 10 minutes.  Would have been about 2 minutes, if not for the rollers being oversize.
B003SOJVMS|5|Fit perfectly.  Solved the P0403 obII code!
B00DUL8DIC|5|It is really awesome! It keeps the rain and the dirt from getting on my car.
B00171XWJ2|1|they don't fit i want a refund
B000F5LJ7S|5|Received in as promised ...packing great
B004O844EM|5|I also bought the extension.  It was easy to assemble.  It is lightweight, sturdy, and looks good.  I am happy and would recommend it.
B000EQQ57M|3|There's nothing wrong with this mount per se but it does not come with the bracket (small arm piece sticking out the side) to actually attach it to the motor. This means you would have to reuse your OEM bracket which is fine except it's pressed into the mount so there's basically no way you can get it out by hand. I returned it and bought this mount instead which worked great http://www.amazon.com/MTC-W0133-1759500-MTC-Engine-Mount/dp/B001G6M1BS/ref=sr_1_2?s=automotive&ie=UTF8&qid=1440279927&sr=1-2&keywords=MTC+Engine+Mount
B00ARUSWMG|5|it arrived and my wife is super excited it fits in beautiful! thanks!!
B004LWVEKS|4|This is so easy to use and it served its purpose to charge my motorcycle battery.
B00IFPA4AI|5|I have a 2009 Acura MDX. The bluetooth stopped working intermittently (no pairing, no steering wheel controls). I was able to install this in less than 10 minutes. It fixed all my woes.
B00W32EO0K|5|Proudly showing this magnet on my beautiful car!
B00B2AFKP2|5|Lifted back of jeep 2 inches and looks great.
B00K23YDBW|2|The construction of this, visually, is great! (+2 stars for that!) The welds are perfect, the bends in the tubing are perfect and the flanges are very nice! However, it rattles. It's not a small rattle. It's loud enough that I can hear it inside of my vehicle with the windows up and radio on but at a low volume. I thought it may have been from the flex joint but it actually appeared to be coming from the converter assembly itself as I tried to isolate the noise with a stethoscope and found it to be coming from the front of the catalyst. The noise is unacceptable and I had to return the catalyst.<br /><br />I believe this to be an issue with the design of the exhaust flow through the catalyst assembly because I ordered a Bosal brand catalyst and it had the exact same rattle. The final fix was a DEC brand catalyst with a wider catalyst assembly and the noise it gone.
B00IS94D1M|2|Does NOT fit a 2004 Ford F-150. Edit: Ok, let me update my review. This does not replace your stock mirror cap. If your original has been broken it will not work. These slip over the top of your original mirror caps. They stick to the front of your original mirror cap. They did not work for me because my original mirror cap had been busted off. The original mirror cap is held on by four screws into plastic. The plastic pieces that the screws go into were all broken. So there is nothing for this mirror cap to stick onto. Also, these are not really black. They have a black and grey checkered pattern on them. They do not look like the original black ones. So you cannot replace just one. That would not match. You would have to put on both sides. The package comes with both sides however. So you could do that.
B0002SQYTG|5|A simple, well made tire gage. If you like to use this style of tire gage, look no further.
B00CI42KPO|5|Great choice for mounting my 315/70/R17 spare. Instructions were clear and simple (plus TeraFlex has numerous mounting and adjusting videos on YouTube). I was able to mount my tire even closer to the tailgate than my OEM mount/tire, which should reduce torque on the OEM sheet metal door. I didn’t go with the hinge (because of budget limitations) but I will get one when I can. I kept the OEM bump stops but trimmed them about 3/4in shorter to allow the tire to sit as close to the gate as possible (see picture 1). The kit I received was slightly different than the one in the picture. My mount (see photo 2) only had 3 sets of stud mounting locations and the 3rd brake light bracket bolted to some through hole lug nuts (see photo 3) that came with the kit. Bottom line, TeraFlex does the engineering to make their products exceed expectations and the folks at Boyds Performance Diesel got my order out the door quick.
B00INVF40E|5|Good, flexible, heavily insulated , stranded copper wire.  Excellent.
B00MNRA828|5|Easy to apply, looks great, love it!
B0057VQUUG|4|This worked out perfect for me. My shed is about 6-7 in above the ground. I have a Troy-Bilt bronco 42in mower. The ramps seem really stable and i'm been very happy with them. The only negative being is i think they are a little pricey for what they are but they were exactly what i needed.
B0002SRFLM|5|I've pulled so many things with this puller, bearings, hubs, wheel spacers...<br /><br />It's one of those tools you think will be only good for a one time project, but as it turns out, it's really useful to have in your toolbox if you're spending any amount of time working on vehicles.
B006P89JYO|5|High quality patch
B0097A9PDC|5|Just hooked these and they are working great. I didn't notice that they were hard to plug in. Maybe these were molded better. I like these better than the OEM ones because you can pinch the side and it disconnects.
B0037TRDY2|3|Following online reviews highly recommending this product for the removal of oxidisation of car headlights, I ordered it from the U.S. Lots of elbow-grease later, it has made a very slight difference to the headlights. However, it did a much better job on wheel trims. Overall, I don't think it's any better than any other metal cleaner.
B005ASY2ME|5|Good pump for my methanol injection.
B000KL32HC|5|Perfect for my 2003 Mini Cooper head unit install.
B002AKIAVE|3|I had to cut the set bolt.<br /><br />As the Mazda crowd said, it does not slide through the rib of the pulley on a 2010 Camaro either.<br /><br />BUT, if you cut the bolt you can tighten it to secure the tool in place and it worked flawlessly.<br /><br />I guess Mazdas really ARE for sissies.<br /><br />Only three stars for me because I did have to modify the tool. But.........<br /><br />Just cut the bolt and it works great.
B000CLQP7E|5|The install on a Mazda 6 was easy.  The front pads are much harder, the clips are the tricky part. I ordered on a Sunday, did not get it until the following Sunday.  Way to slow Amazon. I figured Weds or Thursday tops. The brakes, excellent, no squeaks, grabs well, cannot complain. Keep in mind you need a special tool on the Mazdas or any car that has discs all around. I have worked on cars for years, but never on the newer calipers, but it turned out good. I rented my tool from the auto parts store.  They give you a week to keep it. I use to think it would be only for a day. Deposit is pricey, don't loose the tool.
B000TYOFOY|2|The switch was fine- it's just that I needed more than that they fix the problem.
B00P2D41LE|5|Good quality, doesn't fit 2014 Nissan Altima tail/stop socket , but i give it to my friend to install it as a turn signal on his 2008 honda accord coupe
B00C8A2WZG|3|Definitely not worth the inflated price. These OEM Honda &#34;All Weather&#34; mats look OK but they are very thin and cheaply made. I actually had to use a razor blade to trim the edges of every mat as there was extra thin rubber attached to the edges. Guess the mold these mats came out of didn't do a very good job of cutting around the edges. Don't know how long these thin rubber mats will last, but when they wear out I will not buy this &#34;OEM' Honda mat again. Would probably choose Plasticolor brand as they are much higher quality and have about the same fit qualities. Wish I checked other brands BEFORE purchasing these over-priced mats.
B00E9HWS9G|5|Fit the back of our Ford Escape great! Doesn't slip, and looks good. It was very easy to cut. The other good reviews are true. It's a steal!
B0043DQNZ6|5|Works just like it should
B00029J3AW|5|Fit perfectly
B00ED5LJGC|5|This thing is sweet!! It fit pretty good in my 2007 Scion Tc. It came with everything I needed. The only thing I thought was dumb was the second part of the tubing doesn't have anything to bolt it to so it just kind of wiggles around behind the front fender. But that's only with my car. It might be different with other ones. The other thing was the hose clamps where really hard to turn. I can get it with a screw driver but its hard. But other than those two things its awesome. You can definitely notice a difference with this thing and my car it all stock. Plus it sounds cool when it sucks in a lot of air.
B004304C0W|5|this mat is perfect for camping. Pine needles,sand or dirt come right off. And if it rains it keeps the mud at bay. And when you get home just put it on driveway and hose off. It's very light unlike the fake grass rugs that get very heavy when wet. Should have bought years ago
B006RXZWYS|4|Good heavy duty tie downs... shipped in a huge box??? Wish there were mounting bolts.... after looking into mounting them I would have not used a standard bolt anyway...
B00R3OU4GG|4|Very happy with these tires so far.
B001C9V98K|5|Great tool!  Very happy with fast delivery too!  Thanks!
B00JBNYYQ8|1|it does not work at all. don't waste your money.
B00DGHZO96|5|Too big for my bike
B00ZOKJVAG|5|Nice and big: we use them in our Tahoe. They cling easily & stay up!
B000HS1356|5|Fit my fz09 perfect.
B000ARPVNO|5|It works, got real quiet really fast and slowed the leak down so I could have time to find it
B006X8BATI|5|Fit very well .  Looks super. Very easy to install
B00JW1WH0E|3|It fits but not a factory fit!  I had to cut one of the tabs to make it fit because the spacing was off.  I also installed 3  #6-32 button head bolts to the back side to secure it in place since the fit wasn't securing it to the tailgate enough to suit my taste!<br /><br />This was installed on my dad's 2004 Ford F250 Super Duty and he can' t tell any difference between what fell off along the road somewhere and got lost and the one I installed  so he's happy which males me happy<br /><br />Best part about this product is the price which is half that of the factory replacement!
B01015G0BQ|3|Makes my black Silverado look like knight rider but where the bulbs snap in its very loose
B00QEXOMY2|5|Super bright white light!
B006O74SSI|5|Worked great on my 06' CBR600RR.
B005KLCW5A|1|That is not worth this price ! Too expensive .
B007KP0JH2|5|Installed on a John Deere LA145 w/ Briggs & Stratton 22HP.  Fast Shipper, Excellent Starter, Direct bolt-on and Fitment.  Installed and fixed my week starter problem.  So far, this starter has been working fine for the past two weeks. Good Price and Recommended!
B00GURJZZI|5|Carb is of good quality and i received it very fast.  I did have to tune it when installing it but, that is normal.  It works very well and it is a good value.
B006CRT72W|3|The remote module arrived as promised, the instructions were good, but the doggone thing didn't work!  A helpful young man in Customer Service gave me a clue -- &#34;check the battery&#34;!  I went to a local shop who did that, and VOILA! the battery was dead.  Someone in the Vendor's shop didn't check the device B/4 shipment.  Caused a minor irritation but was soon fixed.
B000BWE4M2|4|Looked pretty good on the Camaro and it really sets it out! Could have used just 2 more rolls for the final touch.
B00FEAHJHS|2|Once installed checked it out at night and the driver side looks really sharp but the passenger side is so dim can't even notice hopefully they will replace so I can give them 5 stars
B00T2GT9L4|5|everyone should have one of these in their car. You hope you never need it, but it is great to have. I was able to come to the rescue of a young woman stuck with a dead battery in a store parking lot. It was quick and easy to use. I recommend this for all cars.
B0031BTFO2|4|YES IT BETTER THAN NOTHING. IT HELPS FOR ABOUT AN HOUR.
B0006O1ICY|5|Very good quality
B00E6V8CRW|5|Works
B010RTGIQI|1|Money well spent. Saved hundreds of dollars versus the dealership. Both doors work perfect. Make sure you have a good mechanic to do the installation, not an easy fix but can be done. My next order is already in the works/fender flares
B004GCR858|5|Great product
B00DQJAFPM|5|Looks Awesome
B00T7GYDTC|5|Great light and well built. Mounted on my son's UTV and it worked perfectly. It is very bright and adds a whole new dimension to riding at night!
B00877SL2M|5|Great price for the quantity!
B001GH1PTG|5|the handle on my hi lift jack doesn't move at all..
B006CNTBI6|5|They were great???
B00GSAUHB8|3|I have a small Hyundai Elantra. It falls out of my windshield pretty easily. Does the job, but I really expected it to fit better.
B00YB4A434|4|They fit well. The only problem I encountered was that the end caps. I had to glue them back on after 1 week of riding.
B00N31NGVI|4|I took off the chain and placed it directly on the ring. Nice enough.
B001AR47YC|4|Great
B00JFSPJL8|5|A lot brighter than I expected. nice clear lens, good light output. Will definitely keep these in mind for other projects
B0016HXWJ2|5|very easy to install.  completed it in 20 minutes
B009VYWIMO|5|Worked great! Installed easily. Highly recommend!
B00FE7M2HS|5|Worked perfectly
B00XZ9N5S2|5|it is excellent
B009DJV936|5|Works great on my 2004 Ford F-150!
B000GTX3MM|1|The information is not according with the model that has to be
B0018KVP4Q|5|great
B005FKS8NG|5|Solid Product. easy to install and is full of easy to understand instructions on breaking in the rotors/pads.
B009WVDMTY|5|High quality, doesn't break down, stylish
B00AJQURWQ|4|Works geeat.only problem is you have to get.in front of the car to turn the lights on you can not do it from inside the car.
B00JBG8VP0|5|Go beast mode!
B00JN0U4SQ|5|Just bought one for my runner and my tacoma. Looks awesome and functions. I am still able to use the radio. Greay purchase
B00PT18QAQ|5|Nice design and easy to hold on to when checking tire pressure. Has a satisfying sound when pushing side button to release pressure after viewing the reading.
B000UD2IZ2|5|Exactly what I wanted and at a good price.
B006H81A7G|5|Perfect fit
B00M9NXUHG|3|Too much play in the adjustments did not  work as deep into the soil as I would have liked, though I had it in the lowest setting. This will wear prematurely.
B000EA5WLS|1|DID NOT HELP AT ALL!
B00HZ27IE2|5|Sweet item
B002OPM1NS|5|Work great on my kfx 450
B000AUMYMM|5|Turned out great. Product glosses up when it drys and seems to be a nice hard coat. Proper surface prep is key to having this product come out great. Read lots of reviews of bad outcomes and pretty sure it was due to poor prep. Mine turned out flawless as my brakes were brand new. There is enough paint in the little can to probably do two full cars of brakes.
B0049DYW3A|5|worked perfectly for my 2005 mazda 3s
B001OYRGJ4|3|Smaller than I'd hoped
B00EA0ZB7I|3|Fast delivery, having issues with water / condensation inside lines
B004FG1HQQ|5|These help to keep the trunk organized and helps keep objects in their place.  I now have 2 sets, one that came with the car and now this set.
B00EECLRM0|1|wrong ones
B007ZTO4CE|4|Worked great.
B00HTOB0NG|5|*******update**********Kensun customer service is working with me to resolve my concern. If you want to buy a product that is backed by the manufacture you can't go wrong with Kensun. They get 5 Star for the customer service alone.  This was easy to install. My problem is that I bought the HID headlights for two new GM trucks and had a problem with both vehicles were the right headlight wouldn't turn on intermittently. Kensun Technical Assistance was very helpful and suggested I try the relay kit. I installed flicker modules and relays in both vehicles and it fixed the concern with the right headlight. Now intermittently I don't have both lights working. I have been stranded once already at night. I love how bright the lights are but sadly I'm going to remove them. This set up doesn't work with a 2011 Silverado or 2013 Sierra.
B007FISHDM|5|Replaced both sides of my 2005 Suburban and they were perfect fit. Easy to change and look fantastic. Arrived quickly.
B008NMHDWK|1|Poor fit - what else is there to say.  About an inch off of the original
B000CB7G4K|4|Same original shock that came with my F-150 FX4 package.  They work great.
B005CQT6VQ|4|This product is just perfect for long trips. It has dual drink compartiments and even a small table to hold a small plate.<br />Pros<br />- easy to install<br />- two cupholders and table<br />- lot of space<br />Cons<br />- they could do the holes in the adaptors bigger, some car models have thicker bars underneath the headrests and it would not fit
B00RILMLZQ|5|Easy to install
B00MB0EXGE|3|Shoes not as pink as I expected
B00X4U9YM8|5|Very pretty and arrived very quickly.
B007N6P76G|4|Installed in 15 minutes in my 2005 F350.  Can't say I feel a huge difference from stock.  Then again, my truck only has 75k on it so the stock stabilizer may not have gone bad yet.  For those trying to correct &#34;death wobble&#34;, this stabilizer will only help mask a suspension problem.  If you have the wobble you need to diagnose the true cause.
B012YZFXSW|5|Arrived on time and as described.
B00KTJ9I46|5|No needed to pay for programming, the keyless open door comes with a programming manual easy to use. I did program mime in 1 minute. Definitely recommend it.
B002YK78VI|4|Worked perfectly
B00F8I5WW0|4|Just what I needed. (Just what I needed)
B000CQ6ECK|5|Beat my exasperations. Was packaged nice and came with everything to install right. The stamped steel is thick gage  and the crome is awsome.
B00MWNZ1E8|3|One of the latches will not stay locked. Now I have a mini-pole sticking up while I drive.
B00HTOB0NG|5|2012 Ram 3500, HID lights would flicker and then fail. This solved the problem perfectly. Took 5 minutes to install and was far less expensive than the competition.
B00KTHWGQA|5|Easy to program, works great!!!
B005BOQQDA|4|Did not have any lettering but it did fit which was the important part<br />Paul
B007ZUOZXQ|5|None of the local auto parts stored sold just the compressor clutch assembly, which was all I needed. The a/c over time would not turn on, but if it tapped the clutch it would start spinning and get cold- the sure sign the clutch was bad. The item was as described.  Installation would have been easier if I would have unbolted the compressor to tilt it up to removed the clip rings- I only did it when I was installing the new rings. Forget about using the special pliers to remove and install the rings, there's very little room to work. I ground the tip of an old, cheap screwdriver into a tool to be able to slip it between the clip and the shaft to pop it out a bit, and then grabbed it with needle nose pliers and pried the old one out, since it was getting thrown out anyway.<br /><br />In the end it took about 3 hours, if I'd done what I said to start it would have been a 90 minute job. For $100 and a few hours I saved a thousand dollars at an auto repair shop installing a new compressor and having to clean/ recharge the air conditioning system.<br /><br />There are multiple videos on YouTube showing you how to do it.
B009AA2J0U|5|Worker as described.  Fit perfectly & service air bag light went out on start up.
B005OC9MNA|1|Did not have my model of 59 ford in it
B004GDFCKA|5|WOW! I admit to being spoiled by Amazon Prime delivery, so when this item showed up a WEEK before I expected it, since it was not a Prime item, I was impressed.  When I took it out to install it, and found it was a near perfect match to  my old part (the old part had faded and had different OEM marks on inside,) and that it took me all of 4 minutes to install it, I have to say Wow.<br /><br />Excellent part, Excellent vendor service and shipping, Excellent value.  I don't post a lot of reviews like this, but you have to give good reviews for service and an item like this.  Saved money and hardly waited at all.
B00CGGXSVO|5|Fit the 2015 Silverado Perfectly
B007USCM7E|5|Works great easy to use  , watched the video a few times and was done in 5 minutes . A/C is very cold . Thanks
B00MYA6Y7M|5|Looks great, however the material they use makes it a little harder to apply than most stickers
B000CO96EK|3|The nylon washer around the stud is okay as a seal, but it is easily damaged if over tightened. The o-ring  on the drain plug deforms too easily. Take it off and throw it away. Use teflon tape on the thread instead.
B00DI3DV6G|2|Smaller than expected.  Dissatisfied with purchase.  Prompt delivery.
B002PL5822|5|I bought these to avoid letting my  mechanic install aftermarket pads.  They seem to work just fine.  Time will tell.
B00KXKNZXQ|4|Nice
B00OC8MWG6|5|Love it!
B00TTCA6KE|5|Great deal. Working good so far.
B00W5UCY9I|5|I am a mom of 3 children that all do sports and they all love to have part of their closet in my trunk. I got this car organizer to help my trunk look neat. It has a large center mesh pocket, 2 smaller side mesh pockets and 2 gusseted pockets in the center to store smaller items. The straps clip together and are adjustable. The only thing I will add to this is a strap in the middle too, but it still works good. It is very easy to set up. The quality of this product is good and very well made. Now my trunk looks great and we can find what we are looking for. If my review helped you in any way can you please click the like button!

B004135NF4|5|Perfect fit.
B000CPI5Z0|5|I have a 2005 Toyota Sienna with 202K miles.  The dash warning lights have been on for a while.  The OBD-2 read at three different shops indicated that the two catalytic converters needed to be replaced.  Bids ran from $1050 to $1800.  Not what I wanted to hear.  I decided to gamble with some sort of fuel system/exhaust cleaner, figuring there was little downside.  After researching products on Amazon, I decided to go with Red Line Complete SI-1 Fuel System Cleaner.  I added it to a full tank of regular gas, about 22 gal., and low and behold, after 100 miles of driving, the warning lights went out, and have not been back on.  I imagine there was some carbon buildup in the catalytic converters hindering flow, and this product took care of the problem.  Needless to say, I am impressed.
B00J3Z1020|4|Great product.  Heats up reasonably fast and thereafter works until you unplug it.  Very convenient to use.
B00KVRIQ94|5|Exactly as ordered.
B00WTJ5C44|5|Look good way better than OEM however i have no idea on how long they will last.
B0074EJ9QQ|5|I love this! its so cute and super soft! its really hard to put on the steering will, but it fits. it does smell once its out of its package but it goes away. I recommend!
B0089LT0D0|5|Well this is the OEM honda air filter. There are no cons. this is as good as a regular air filter can be. course there are these extremely nice K&N filters but not at these price points . not even close.
B000ST5AY4|5|Fits the Genuine Scooter Company Buddy 50 with windshield and milk crate &#34;topcase&#34; perfectly
B009AA2FAY|5|Perfect
B00X4IY77C|5|No problems what so ever, no cracks or moisture behind lens, quality product
B0036C0PVI|5|Good product, Good Price.
B00T8HPCGS|5|Lights look great on my truck and easy to install
B00HUW2I1A|5|Exactly what I wanted!
B00UIEZDSC|5|Yes would buy again
B00G1XB8O2|5|Good product. Easy set up.
B004YYF5GW|4|When we started putting it on we saw a label that it was not for a Trail 4Runner, which is what we have. While we did not have to cut or take off any items in the instructions, we had to put some shims to get it to fit right. The pictures in the instructions were of poor quality. I was concerned how it was packaged as it was just wrapped with bible wrap.  The quality seems good.
B00651CIGM|3|Looks great but I lost some stations. Worth it though for the look I guess.
B000BQW5LK|5|​►...great for draining the coolant reservoir without having to remove it outright.
B00GW3QMT2|5|Great filter, exactly like OEM but better.  Would love to get stickers next time though!
B0097BC6UU|1|I don't care what anyone says - these do NOT fit my 2012 Cruze!
B000XQ9MGE|5|Ordered this as gift for my wife's son. He found it to be very useful and didn't have any complaints.
B00RE6KV48|5|Favorite new product. Leather looks and feels like brand new.
B002JH469I|5|Good size for the price and I always get compliments for it from random drivers.
B00D0XHGTC|5|This license plate frame is great! It looks really great on the 2011 Mustang I bought it for. The best part is it is pretty sturdy, unlike other license plate frames I have seen. It does not rattle on rocky roads and the finish is really stunning and contrasts the plate and goes with the finish. Highly recommend if you have a mustang!
B001D566IG|5|Already on my second set.
B00NXRX8RY|4|Works fine. Took away a star because there was no instruction to remove the white blade covers before installation. Make sure to take yours off!!
B003XT8Y26|5|Genuine BMW mats. I had used cheap generic mats for a few years. These OEM mats are a total improvement. They fit perfect, stay secure using BMW's floor attachments and are made of thick, plush material. All the little details are what make a BMW a BMW.
B00TI9OFKK|5|Yes it was just what I was looking for and it worked great
B00BRKESPA|5|The old factory plugs I pulled out at 111000 miles still looked new and were properly gapped, they could have gone another 100000 miles. Nevertheless, these are the same as the factory plugs, and I will probably never have to ever change the plugs again. They were pre-gapped and ready to go. Save a few buck and buy the four pack.
B00T4TEWBQ|5|Order was smooth and product was as described.
B0096DCFPK|2|These floor mats looked good when I saw them on the listing, but once receiving them, they are not at all how pictured. The logo on the front two mats looks cheap and not like a real Mustang logo, and it is strange that I would put my feet on the nice embroidered part. At least, it would be strange if the mats fit my car, which they do not. The place you should put your feet has a weird plastic thing that your shoes slide off of, making it seem like the mats were worn through or something.<br /><br />If you need floor mats, look somewhere else.
B0028OJCYG|5|Great item
B00CWRDQEQ|5|Thank you
B003TTL0TE|5|Definitely better for cleaning my motorcycle than a rag when reaching around the engine and different parts.
B00X5EPYUO|1|I already commented on this item that it was horrible and fake.
B00RCHGA62|5|Excellent product, price and quick delivery.  thank you
B001GPUUQ2|5|Loved it.
B000HBNTX2|5|Excellent cleaner.  I dilute and use in the shower for a nice scub!
B00W0QIG8A|5|These mats are the best I have ever seen. They fit perfectly and still show original mat. Love, love, love them!!
B000CIT18W|4|Bought this to replace the leaking OEM oil lines on my 04 Astro. I'm usually pretty satisfied with Dorman products so I decided to go with these instead of the twice more expensive ACDelco lines. The product was a perfect fit, and went in easy except for one issue- the supplied replacement rubber mounting bracket that bolts the lines to the side of the engine was too small. I tried and tried to get the bracket to wrap around the lines and line up with the bolt hole in the engine, but gave up after 15 min of frustration. Seemed the bracket was too small for the lines to fit in comfortably. I ended up using the old mounting bracket, which fit and lined up perfectly with the mounting hole. That is the only reason for 4 stars.<br /><br /> I was also pleased that replacement retainer rings for the radiator fittings were included, along with a page of instructions on how to remove and install them, in case you are unfamiliar with how they work. Will update if I experience any issues with these lines in the future.
B000ES1Y30|5|:)
B005N53C9I|4|Very nice seat covers but didn't fit my Mitsubishi Outlander Sport, so I had to return.
B000AM8BLI|5|Good price and works well
B000EW0LMQ|1|Only goes to 12 and drops back down? Hopefully I just got the lemon.
B000K2HNEE|5|Phenomenal how light these actually are! I was almost scared to try to load my 3,400 pound Maxima onto my trailer using these, but I bought them because I wanted something lighter weight and easier to manipulate besides the usual solid steel ramps.<br /><br />Absolute truth? I didn't even see them flex (not even a little) with my Maxima sitting squarely in the middle of these ramps. That's a 3,400 pound car with a fairly significant front bias weight distribution. Taking into account proper gravity and angle calculation and all the rest, it's pretty safe to assume that the ramps were asked to hold over 1,800 pounds between the two. No sweat!<br /><br />I will warn that I love these ramps, but they're not without caveat. The one caveat that I can point out is that the curvature of these ramps is pretty aggressive. You would be very hard pressed to get a lowered car onto a trailer with these without some improvisation. Front bumper of my Maxima scraped a bit and it's sitting at normal height.<br /><br />For reference, the Maxima in question is a 2002 Maxima SE 6-Speed.
B004VNJLJS|2|Fade out really fast after only couple months
B002VVOFW0|5|Hard to know what to say - these are the OEM plugs for my Chrysler Sebring convertible, and they worked just fine.
B0002SR8AK|1|completely useless on 2 of the 3 screws. Don't waste your time. and the second screw that you Can fit it on, can't move but 1 degree at a time because the hole is too small for movement on the 97-03 F150
B000RG6K24|2|Perhaps works better for people with hair.  It has the appearance of horns the way it is stitched.
B00BT0Q194|2|I've experienced a 50% failure on these units in less than 6 months of part time use in my motorhomes bathroom. Totally unacceptable!
B0093KV28C|3|Very light weight. I probably won't but this one again unless there is a sale.
B009WKWSMC|5|Works great
B000CMHIR4|5|Purchased this filter over a K&N based on a friend's recommendation for my 2015 Ford Focus(non-ST), let me tell you this; if you buy this filter you won't be disappointed! The open ended filter design allows you to hear a nice deep, but not overpowering intake note, and swapping the factory paper filter with an aftermarket one and performing the &#34;snorkel delete&#34;( Google it) will add ~8whp and drastically improve drivability!  I highly recommend this product!
B00XZ9MXQM|4|Does not open the trunk. The dealer said that it might have more to do with a broken trunk sensor, BUT considering this key-fob from this vendor has had the same results multiple times now I am not totally convinced, so minus one star.<br /><br />it does lock and unlock the car and the panic button does work. If you want to save some money and can live with being a barbarian and using a key to unlock your boot, this is a good buy.
B00VXZURVS|4|The reverse light section sucks. No real reflector to get the light out of the housing. I've seen candles with better lighting. Seriously.<br />The rest of the unit seems to be well put together. Bright but not too bright. the small 3 LED side marker could be bigger or brighter for safety purposes. I'm seriously considering opening the shell and building my own 36 LED plate of High Flux white LED's and adding to the side marker portion. But we'll see. The lens blends right into my black F150. 4*'s for a crappy reverse light.
B005N53C9I|5|Exactly what was expected. It keeps the light tan seats in a 10 year old vehicle clean so expensive detailing can be avoided over stupid spills and mistakes.
B00U35RY4M|4|I like this product. Installation was quick and easy. I think it should be sturdy. However my rider said it works good.<br />Prevents stopping just to get a drink.
B00OK6DMVO|4|good
B00408VRJQ|1|I buy both side but the one I need is broken (drive side)
B00068OKZ2|5|fits and runs in mini 2002 s with some added bolts for fitting
B00NQVFM9O|5|I put these on the headrests in my FJ Cruiser and the Nissan Rogue and they work great to hold grocery bags to keep them from sliding and spilling.  These are very strong and can hold alot.
B00C5CQYY2|5|Arrived view trailer quicker than expected. Easy to install. Less the 5 minutes. Works great
B000CPAFQC|5|Works Great!
B00B2A2RR6|5|Awesome product, worked as intended
B00AEK55WY|4|Wires are really small hard to srip without cutting them copper wires even with just fingertips other than that lights work good
B00FEL30R0|5|Works very well.
B0012H6HMK|5|I purchased these for outside my RV and they work great and look pretty cool.
B00OAONZSG|4|Fit well, AM-FM antenna works good. I have no idea about the CB antenna because I don't use the CB.
B00G0OUGSG|5|Delivered quickly, part as advertised, works great!
B0050HGZC0|4|Live this item. Makes it easy to take down when not needed.
B00OBYDGU2|5|THE HEADLIGHTS ON MY 95 HONDA LOOK GREAT AND, AS A WOMAN, I FOUND IT EASY TO USE.  I WOULD HAVE LIKED MORE DESCRIPTION OF THE VARIOUS PADS.
B00D3YEGO6|5|the license plate frame is phenomenal actually ordered another for a friend.... packaging is superb... i do wish you could use all four bots to hold  the plate... the bottom has no place for bolts and when i shut my truck the plate and frame hit making a rattle noise... but the look is superb!!
B0021I2B74|5|Just drilled a couple of holes and tightened down the self tapping bolt.  Had to raise the jeep pretty high to get room for my drill.  Disconnected sway bars to get it high enough.<br /><br />Sway bars.were not an issue because I was measuring for limiting straps at the same time and have quick disconnects.  Ordered 20&#34; skyjacker straps.
B00E9G0GYQ|4|had to remove rubber mounts and modfify two washers but made it fit in my motor and it works great.
B001BK4A7W|5|Awesome found, great price and easy to attach.
B00NTVMLTA|5|In my 2015 1.8, the brake pedal fits very easily, Simply slip off old rubber piece currently on brake, two tabs hold it in, and replace with new pedal.  The brake has a VW part number on the back of the rubber piece.<br /><br />The dead pedal is one solid piece held together by small tabs.  This is harder to install only because of the hood release plastics cover screw hole.  Not too bad to do but I left off and only did real pedals for now to see if I like it like that.<br /><br />The gas pedal, as someone else mentioned is put together the worse.  The black rubber piece is not attached and the chrome 'metal' piece has tabs to secure on only right half.  First, I tried to firmly attach the rubber and 'metal', but it only holds slightly causing them to fall apart easy.  So after a few tries I found the best way to secure to gas pedal.  I cut small pieces of 3M tape and put at top and bottom between rubber and 'metal' to secure these two parts.  I bent the tabs that were not pre bent loose enough to slip over gas pedal, I think thats what it is designed to do.  I also put a few pieces of 3M between rubber and gas pedal to hold even more secure than the bent tabs.<br /><br />Because I only did the real pedals it took 4 minutes to install both gas and brake. Had I got gas on first try this is a 2 minute install counting cutting and peeling 3M tape.
B000HTAH70|5|Great center punch I use it a lot around the house, small but it does pack enough of a punch. I am even using it at the moment to mark bearing and cam caps on my motor rebuild with ease. Great tool at a good price point.
B00CEXK9TS|5|Love these. I get them for all my vehicles.
B000C2ZKCE|5|How would one know if they got a poor quality filter? It's cheap, it does the job, and I pair it with high milage oil.<br /><br />Used it on my 2000 chevy cavalier before it was totaled; also on my 2001 chevy venture.
B00BZA648G|5|Great replacement on my 98 900RR! No more heat issues
B00M9IFVOQ|5|Works as it should
B0092P19T0|5|As usual they fit precisely and do the job. I'm very happy... this is my third set.
B005NLQAHS|5|I've been using this product for over 2 years now and it works great on many models.<br />Some vehicles I've used to diagnose/troubleshoot/fix thus far:<br />2008 Mercedes c350<br />  Cam shaft position sensor codes<br />2004 Dodge Dakota<br />  Post Cat oxygen sensor<br />2004 Grand Prix GT<br />  Catalytic Converter<br />  Throttle Body needing cleaned due to MAF code<br />2003 Chevy Malibu LS<br />  Spark Plug Cylinder 2 (Misfire)<br />  Spark Plug Wires (Misfires in multiple)<br />2004 Subaru Forester<br />  Catalytic Converter<br />2008 Toyota Avalon<br />  PCV Valve<br />2008 Mini-Cooper<br />  Knock Sensor<br /><br />There have been others but as you can see, most makes/models.  Unfortunately it can't read ABS, but for the money and its quality, it works amazingly well!  If you want the ABS functionality as well, I'd recommend BlueDriver OBDII, but I'd still buy this one and use in conjunction with BlueDriver just because of it's track record with the number of vehicles I have used it on.  Everyone should buy this tool.  I've saved myself as well as others thousands.
B002SSKFGG|4|works good. easy to install
B00GGCE6ZG|5|Sounds exactly how I wanted it to, gives it that Subaru Rumble. Only problem would have to be it throws a code just from it not having a muffler. After buying an aftermarket intake that took care of the problem.
B001BK658Y|5|Great fit and looks just like an OEM part right down to the grain in the plastic and the lettering and symbols on the mirror glass. Very impressed.
B001EUPJQK|3|They welded the 3/ear bracket on the wrong side of the harness. so the pigtail won't clip in to the holder for a clean oem look. If the pigtail was two inches longer/or they welded the offset ear in the right place. It would have fit perfectly. I don't think the China-man realized that the ears are offset in the housing of the of the unit.
B00OU67Z80|5|SUPER bright.  Use it on my boat.......now I can find my mooring at night!
B005EVGWN4|4|Very nice item! It can't get 5 stars, because of the light button. If u pack it, and presses up<br />against anything, it drains your battery.
B000HZFDOQ|5|Moved to Arkansas from Oregon about 2 years ago. Both winters so far have had ice storms and they don't manage the roads here in Arkansas the way they did in Oregon. Driving a car with front-wheel-drive in this weather required chains. These chains went on fairly easily and worked well.
B00OH0S5Y2|1|burned out quickly. many of them
B002HU3D6Y|2|Average at best, but above average market price. I blame MB for price. Many better products for cheaper.
B00NF1RE3C|5|Fixed my 2006 BMW X5 for $50 instead of $800. Been atleast 500 miles and still fine. Fit perfectly.
B0082365AQ|5|Does the job very well.
B0082GG9FO|2|Doesn't  cover my car good,  but not bad
B00JMAPSGK|5|Great! Will buy again!
B008BVVY1O|4|Cover my car good I like it.
B002VW775G|5|good equipment and at a fair price
B00F66T7XE|5|Excellent product worked just as described was simple to install would recommend to a friend !
B00T0WJ5VO|1|I unrolled my tint fresh out of the undamaged box, there were terrible creases in the film, rendering it unusable. I'm absolutely NOT happy about it
B0009H51V2|5|great air filter
B00VGL7Z5A|5|Good solid pin. clip is a little stiff.
B0031XI03M|5|Worked perfectly. I just had to figure out how to properly install it.
B000C2Y0KW|5|Excellent
B003LDROGG|5|good
B00HXC40SG|5|installs easily, heats perfectly, switch looks great, i hope it has longevity
B0061FY004|5|I used it immediately to help guide the drill on the edges of some shelves. Very nice. I used some Johnsons paste wax to protect it from moisture.
B007GRSNUE|4|I have had a few pairs of Tour Master Solution WP boots, but these are the first Air models.  Same great fit, low cost and easier to get on and off than the first gen models.  Yes, they are water proof, at least when new.  I have liked my previous models so much that I tend to wear them around long after I get off the bike.  That tends to make them wear a bit quicker and eventually lose their water proof status.<br /><br />At this price, I expect them to be 100% water proof for at least two seasons, if not three.  We will see how that goes.  One down and so far so good.
B007137D2W|4|Did the job
B004I16MZO|4|This was delivered very quickly and was super easy to install. Would recommend highly.
B00HUBXBBM|5|Very comfortable.
B005JCTLFY|4|The cover worked very nicely. It is a bit large for my scooter so we put bungee cords across it so it didn't flap in the wind.
B008RYOD36|5|OEM pack, perfect fit, good value price
B00BDBWRJW|5|worked like a charm easy to install
B0016HPUS8|5|Ordered this part after looking around locally and realizing the auto part stores were not selling AC Delco oil sender units.  If I'm going to spend my time replacing a part I don't want to have to do it again any time soon, and ACDelco parts tend to hold up.<br /><br />This was for a 2004 Suburban Z71. Highly recommend also ordering the Lisle socket which more securely mates to the sender unit rounded bolt faces.  No need to remove the intake manifold as some folks do.<br /><br />Other than a few scrapes on my wrist from reaching around to the back of the engine, the replacement went well enough and the oil pressure sending unit is working.
B000EQU1DQ|1|This horn does not fit 4th Generation F-body cars without modification, THIS LISTING IS INCORRECT
B00CXBAJBO|5|work great
B00NB808P0|1|What a piece of junk, no directions & leaks from above the  spout.
B000BAWOUS|5|Great program for the price
B00KH54A04|5|ok
B007EERHYM|1|The  bottom of the plate is so thick it covers the year and month registration stickers to the point that you can't tell if they are good or not.
B0071I2WZ0|5|easy to put on and has worked great for the last few months
B0041TGLAO|5|I purchased a 2004 Saturn Ion 2 with 111,000 miles on it in good condition but when I would turn the air conditioner or heat on there would be a clicking noise coming from the vents. It turned out it was coming from below the glove box. After reading Saturn forums online I found out this annoying clicking noise is a common problem and replacing the blower motor would fix it. To fix it I<br /><br />1. Went under the glove compartment, unplugged the wiring and with a small utility knife I cut around the plastic housing in the small groove. The blower motor then dropped out (there's about 3 inches around around the housing that doesn't have a groove so I cut it free hand and then bent it a little as it was the last piece).<br /><br />2. I then put the blower motor and plastic housing on my table and removed the 2 bolts in the middle that held the motor to the plastic housing. Using a flat head screw driving I was able to easily separate the motor from the plastic housing.<br /><br />3. I then put the plastic housing over the new blow motor and reused the bolts to secure it.<br /><br />4. I put the provided mounting ring over the motor/plastic housing bottom and screwed in 3 screws where they belong.  No screws were used in the car originally (this is why you must cut the plastic with a utility knife) and no screws were provided with this set. After reading a Saturn forum I purchased six #8 metal screws 5/8 length which fit perfectly. It's kind of odd Saturn would design a car prepared to be cut open and screwed back together but I guess this saved them some time during production.<br /><br />5. I then took the new motor and old plastic housing back under the glove box and there are 3 more holes on the bracket that line up perfectly with the 3 holes for mounting. After screwing them in (you'll need a short stubby screw driver to attach a screw near the front) I plugged back in the wiring and it was complete!<br /><br />I turned on the air conditioning and it was like new. Nice, quiet, powerful. Music to my ears!<br /><br />I am not a mechanic and I do not have much automotive kowledge but this was surprisingly easy and took 20 minutes to do. It took longer to write this review! It was totally worth it. I have no idea what a repair shop would have charged me.
B00KTIZLZC|3|No direction how to program. Not the same electronics as my old one but only needed the case.
B007Q1K6EQ|5|Work great !!!!
B011VTWX0S|1|Hi I m not satisfied with this project because one LED light bulb is not working and I already talked about this things to tha selar .he promised to me that he sent me one more LED light bulb . But I didn't get yet. And he gives me tracking number but it's not working it's say that item not found. And he said that led light bulb reach with in 36 hours but it's passed more than weeks now .

B00T5U9LQK|2|Took a long time to recieve a poor quality sticker.
B00029WSZ4|5|These are some really nice mirrors. Quality materials and craftsmanship and very easy to install even by one person.
B001GO76AG|5|Nice purchase to lock my RV, not impossible to steal it thou, but at least thief will have extra work to get it.
B00A2VKU0W|5|This is a very good product. I watched all the install video's. This is a good thing because a few had tips on what to do around the spokes with the double stitch. My original 14 year steering wheel was starting to fall apart. It took sometime...two hours but it looks great. The instructions said between 1 to two hours. I wanted it to be tight and uniform all around.  I believe I achieved that as an amateur.
B0010GG7YG|5|Perfect fit, 10 minute installation. Price was excellent.
B002RSIK4G|5|It is truly amazing stuff.  I bought some about a decade ago and its still going strong.  It beats caulking, gluing, and tarring.  Its fantastic.
B005XK04MQ|5|Does the job quite nicely.  Our umbrella leaned with the wind and now it is straight as an arrow.
B000CCM4ZK|5|durable workmanship, easy to operate, great price for the product. highly recommend
B0058KJ0YO|4|Fit as advertized
B00CFL4SXC|1|I installed the visor on my Puig windscreen to day and it, and the windscreen lasted about an hour before it flew off and was ran over by the car behind me. The rubber windscreen mounts can not withstand the added wind pressure caused by adding the visor.
B0058KJ10W|4|Fit as advertized
B000W0RQ8C|5|Nice lock
B007ICVCPU|3|The build quality is OK. I found that the flanges often get damaged during shipment, and the O2 sensor bungholes are of a material that seems to develop surface rust. Perhaps 409 stainless that got cooled rapidly and they just left the surface rust after welding? The included clamps are of exceptional quality. They also included 2 inserts. These are necessary if your stock manifold knuckle fittings are 2.25&#34;, the easiest way to check is to crawl under your car and measure the outer diameter of the pipe that connects to the exhaust manifolds. If the OD is about 2.28&#34;-2.30&#34;, then you need to use the inserts. If the OD is about 2.54&#34;-2.55&#34;, then you don't need the inserts. Apparently only 05-06 Mustangs had 2.5&#34; exhaust manifold connections, and 07-10 4.6 3V switched over to a 2.25&#34; exhaust manifold connection. As an engineer, I didn't think the inserts would seal properly, but after installing the X-Pipe, I found that it did seal. I have to ask myself why Pypes didn't just make the front a 2.25&#34; connection and forgo the use of the inserts? JBA, BBK, Borla, and a whole slew of other aftermarket manufacturers don't use the inserts, and Pypes claim they all make them for the 2.25&#34; size. Again, why didn't Pypes just do that instead of focusing primarily on 05-06 Mustangs?<br /><br />Why did I give it only 3 stars? Well, 2 of the oxygen sensors are placed too far away from the stock factory harness. The driver side rear O2 sensor is about 0.5&#34; too short, but after stretching some of the connections around, I was able to hook it up. The passenger side front O2 sensor is a solid 2&#34; too short. So I had to yank the factory connector off the bracket and connect it to the sensor, which meant the wire now touches the transmission bell housing. This is poor product design in my opinion.<br /><br />The X-pipe merge weld (where the 2 pipes meet) is immaculate. JBA's merge weld looked like a 5-year old went crazy with a TIG welder with sloppy overruns and leftover welding wire and NUMEROUS artifacts left over. Pype's merge weld is extremely neat and precise. From the inside, it is almost completely smooth!<br /><br />Pipe alignment was solid, and I didn't observe any interference with body panels/mounts while driving the car. The sound difference versus the stock catted H-Pipe is night and day. While the stock H-pipe had a decent rumble and with the right mufflers, even sounded like NASCAR. With this Pypes X-Pipe, it sounds like thunder during startup. It is raspy as heck but I love the sound especially since there is zero drone with straight-thru mufflers. During deceleration, the popping and snarling is magnified. During WOT acceleration, whatever existing sound you had is magnified by 2-3 times. If you want to make it sound stock, just shift up as soon as possible and stay off the throttle - it will sound barely louder than stock so you won't bother the neighbors.<br /><br />Overall: 3/5 stars, could use a slight engineering change for the O2 sensor placement and I wish the inserts weren't required but if you have a 07-10 4.6 3V, use the inserts or measure the OD of the pipe at the manifold connection.py overruns and leftover welding wire and NUMEROUS artifacts left over.

B00NIB9G58|5|Great lights, very bright and easy install
B00HZY6M8S|1|Stupid. Under the button. After the installation, how to use the buttons?
B0044XHW6O|2|plastic frame was scratched upon arrival. I did not know the quality would be this poor so I spent a little extra for a real steel plate frame. The clear cover is ok though.  but if inexpensive is what you want then it does the part.
B00JAXXDAM|5|Easy to fill, charges auickly
B000XECJES|5|Our two order. Great towels
B0102GRPYK|5|Product looks great.  Need these for my dark vehicles.  Edges are shewn with appropriate thread.
B000HBAZM0|4|Works great
B003C01FD6|5|good product
B003UXZ6RG|4|Good product
B010TR13RM|5|carburator was fine the end that goes to breather box was 2 1/2&#34; od. my old one was 2 1/4' od. i had to go to local parts store and get a piece of hose to make it work. left an email through amazon never did get a reply.
B00877SL2M|1|These burn out quickly, had to replace all of them in less than a month
B004J0VDDU|4|Does it fit a v8 z28 yr 94 ???
B007GREMW2|5|Perfect fir on my 11 Rd Glide Ultra. No extensions needed. Got me the couple inches I needed to kick back a little.
B00S75FMB2|3|I love it, other then i could not put it on the back of my truck because it coverd my license plate sticker that has to be shown per my states requirments.
B00DQU9Z3Y|4|Very sturdy cover; fits well. Excellent product value for the price.
B000XQ9MGE|3|not for 3.2 or bigger engine batteries
B00DHQLT2C|4|Love my reflector and the fit is perfect. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I haven't had it long enough to see how it will hold up.
B001B0VP3E|5|They look great on my 2015 Sunset Orange JKU.
B00JF5FAHO|5|Essential tool for VW owners..I'm BMW and AUDI...nice to have. Fits great...recommend for the dying few of us that love to work on mechanical art...
B005YT49V8|1|I had this item since July.  Used the winch 3 times and the motor stopped working.
B003UM7B98|4|Great jack lift height needs to be a little taller, say another 2 inches.
B00LBREK8O|5|Great item
B001C602FO|5|excellent  choice for replacement and lots cheaper that factory.
B0083CNFOU|5|Very good product, reasonably priced and rapid delivery
B00HTOB0NG|5|Worked as stated. I no longer have the &#34;bulb out&#34; message and my HIDs no longer flicker.
B007TYMQ3O|4|The Coolant Overflow Tank was a perfect fit for my 2006 BMW 750Li. Installation was relatively simple, it works like a charm and I have no leaks.  I used the cap from the old leaking Coolant Tank in my car because the new tank does not come with a cap.
B009PIKC4C|5|These floor liner fit perfect.  I have had a few different brands and my boots usually wear a hole through but these are not showing any signs of wear. They still look new and hold their shape very nicely.  Would recommend to anyone.
B004ZF4GKG|5|Very good quality, very bright. Best hids for the price
B00QWYO5A4|5|beautiful and fit perfect in my Jeep Comanche
B003L5HS74|5|It works great. I went with it trusting the reviews and paid a little more and glad I did.it only took 30 min to install. I have a 2006 f350 diesel.  Thanks for everyone who give their feed back.
B00K17A2E6|2|Okay
B00515NJTI|5|works very good for Mercedes M112 engine.
B000JZ33H8|5|Purchased for 2004 F150 XLT SCAB, fits and works as expected. The actual signal 'clicking' sound heard when your turn signal is on is actually more quiet then the factory unit it replaced. I noted my factory flasher had an extra blade on the relay that is not on the EP27, I don't know why but it makes no functional difference. All my signals (front L&amp;R, rear L&amp;R, mirror, and LED strip under tailgate) function properly, I have LED bulbs in all my factory sockets, replacement LED tail lights, and the LED 5 function strip plugged into the factory towing power point. Everything functions as factory, this should cover the 2004-08 F150's minus the Heritage edition. The relay is under the steering column, blue in my truck, attached with a push pin into the hole which can be pulled out or slid off the attaching point, however the replacement has no way to reattach, I used a zip tie around it and through the original hole. It takes a bit of contorting to get it out but no tools are required and the panels do not require removing if you can twist a bit.
B0025CXPYY|5|Does exactly as described, an indispensable tool for doing check springs.
B002T757R8|5|Like the look. Tricking out a '96 goldwing on a budget.  Good product.
B00K581VFK|4|Pretty decent for the price. I saved  a lot of money since I was going to get the OEM  ones
B00AYAICW4|5|I bought these for my 2007 Volkswagen GTI. They work great! I usually buy bosch brand, but decided to try something different. These don't leave streaks or wear out as fast as bosch. They also cost less!
B0002JN2EU|5|Who doesn't love sea foam. Probably the best overall additive out there. Use when driving a full tank of gas so you clean out the fuel system and it doesn't take all the gas tank sludge and put it through your fuel lines
B00GB9SNTE|2|Front lens came scratched up, doesn't effect the leds but looks bad, mounted on the front of my trx450
B00U5U9OWU|1|Not worth it
B00O7UG67A|5|Great product, so easy to apply!
B00RW7WNF4|5|I wasn't sure what these Aero wipers were going to be like.  I had never bought wipers from Amazon or online before, usually opting to go to a brick and mortar store and combing their books.  These snapped onto my Toyota Sienna without complaint and then kept our windshield crystal clear, even during torrential downpours that we experienced while on vacation at the tailend of nearly every day.  The biggest thing I noticed was how quiet they were.  No squeaks.  No streaks.
B004TG2IPQ|5|Good quality.
B00KHUB2CS|5|The knurling on the bars was a little closer together than the knurling on the sock Honda bars I was replacing, but still fit great. They gave the look of my 1981 CM400A a much needed update.
B001P1YTP0|1|It broke right away
B009ECK63G|5|Fit great on my 1981 Honda CM400A. Cables installed easy and move very nicely.
B0078ZM7EM|5|Well made switch and true led
B006EGAIII|4|It works pretty well, supported my vehicle, but it cracked a little bit on the bottom of it, but maybe it's my fault on this one
B00BBILRB6|5|great.
B000EA5WLS|3|Prevents spreading, but doesn't really hide the star crack/chip
B00FR2JF0W|5|Perfect for my dad, he's 77 and was never super electrically inclined. Any do it yourselfer will be happy with thisl. He even installed it himself. Worked great for his GPS on the Motorcycle.
B0076M8TVM|5|Awesome product, worked as intended
B0041DQYKC|5|This Plastikote is some great paint. The name does not lie, it forms a durable plastic like coating on what ever you  paint with it. With a little knowledge of how to spray paint, you will come out with some great looking painted items that will not need painting again for years to come. Since I was painting bare metal, I purchased a can of the gray primer, and one of the flat black top coat. Great stuff.
B00RSOLXFM|5|works great! the fumes from my car have disappeared. this product really works!
B003V5PRLI|5|These tools have been invaluable while working on my Jeep. Having the right angle sockets available is superior to using a universal joint due to the bind-ups, awkward angles, and general fails I am used to enduring. This is a product I was glad to have purchased, and will remain a staple in my tool box.
B003EP2ZAQ|5|These rear fenders look great! They are easy to install, come with installation instructions, and look great, much better than the stock plastic fenders. For the Price, they can't be beat. Smittybilt, you did a good job.
B000C7Z9MU|5|Great product
B00P2D3W00|5|A must upgrade for the heat generated halogen bulbs.  I'm glad to find there is a good replacement for all interior bulbs in my car because PHILIPS is just entering these universal LEDs market from 2013 according to its website?  My family used to forget to turn off the dome or map lights in the car that drained out the battery juice quite a bit.  I have to replace OEM car battery every 3-5 years with its 7 yrs warranty.  Really getting tired of draining the battery problem, so I'm thinking these LEDs upgrade could help to reduce using of much battery juice.  Not only battery draining issue, the heat from the OEM halogen bulbs seem to be shorten the life of one electronic module that costed me over $200 to replace a new one.  Well, I hope these LEDs will save me off a little bit of time and money.  I also prefer to use professional or known name product to keep me safe of electric failure and other expense when thing could go wrong.
B0010E00T6|5|Why pay a dealer $1000 dollars for a thin cheap filter when you can have a thick charcoal filter!
B000765DI6|1|I only received 4 out of 6 bolts and 1 (YES ONE) out of 6 Nuts. To top it off....after I go to the hardware store and spend 14 dollars in parts to complete installation. I come to find out it doesn't even fit my vehicle. (09' Xterra).....2 thumbs way down. I will say though. The quality of CURT as a product is SOLID. No questions there. Just the distributor that I'm complaining about.
B00BHGXPY4|5|Complete package.  Will fit inside that small opening.
B000E283QC|5|Perfect
B00BFDIUV2|5|good
B0002TDUW4|5|Apllied this bedliner a couple months ago, so far this stuff is awesome! The included scotch pad ment for scuffing the paint is no good, just takes a long time and leaves your arm tired. I purchased a sander and some fine grit sandpaper and had the bed primed and taped off in 30min!
B004ZF39T0|5|Awesome lights super bright nice case simple plug and play
B004SQ68U8|1|Nothing molded about it!  Piece of carpet with cut outs.
B000CB6FNS|5|Item was a perfect fit. I installed it on a 99 Cherokee which had the death wobble. It is such a noticeable difference. Well worth the money. Great item.
B000IYN6FO|5|Nice cold air now
B005NLQAHS|5|I have been using this item (purchased from Amazon) for about two years now on a 2003 Lincoln Town Car and a 2003 Ford Expedition. I have also used it on various rental cars. I have had no problems with it. I use an Android device. You can't simply plug this in and go. You have to install/purchase an app that will read and display the information. I use Torque Pro ($5 when I bought it, check for current price), and have no complaints. One of my favorite features is that you can show your instant fuel mileage, I also have it reading many other engine functions, including temp, rpm, fuel delivery rate, vacuum, and a few others. Torque Pro is totally customize-able. Suggestion: to run this app and monitor your vehicle, use an old android phone that you've taken out of service. That way, you can just leave it in the car and not worry about it. Hope this helps.
B001JT7D3I|1|Horrible. Log sheets hang out bottom of cover allowing them to get damaged. Just what the DOT officer wants to see. DO NOT BUY!
B00DUV0UU6|5|This is my first foray into canister-style filters, but quality, fitment, sizing appear identical to the OEM filter installed in the engine by the mfg (this was the vehicle's first oil change). I use a lot of Bosch products (plugs, filters, etc) and this purchase was of the same quality as all my prior purchases. Amazon got it here quickly and in good condition.
B00I4D6SJ2|1|Sadly I bought this item and had it installed at great expense by my electrician.  The item is a generic charger and not built specifically for the Tesla. You need an additional part from Tesla to make it work.  This company does not explain that fact.  Once I bought the part from Tesla,  the product did not work.<br />I have attempted to return it but the manufacturer has not co-operated with any return information or refund.  Amazon.com has also refused to help.<br />But I paid for this non-working, incorrectly advertised item with American Express.  American Express reversed the charges.  But, I lost the cost of the electrician ($1200.00).  Be smart: If you have a Tesla than Buy the charger from TESLA .... you may spend a little more .... but you can't beat the service and the Tesla Charger is designed fro your car and most importantly works. Finally, you cannot beat Tesla customer service.
B00ENTYLGI|1|They lasted three months and then began to flicker, now they look like an extremely dim flashlight. JDM Astar products are terrible. DONOT buy these

B0065X7RCK|5|Nice shirt fit great
B002HU5N4O|5|I love the product! It removes stains and streaks from plastic PVC vinyl. I used it on my boat- sprayed a little on the surface and wiped with a damp towel. Very easily all dirt came off; did the entire boat, looks like new! I never had a product work so well in a single application!
B000EQ8VM4|5|Worked as expected. Easy to install.
B00Y18GLSW|5|Fits right on good stuff arrived on time
B0085XH58O|4|Just what I wanted, thanks!
B00Y5H6SA0|3|This boot cover does NOT fit IS300s with R154s or any JZX100/JZX110 shifter linkage transmission.  I assume this is the same with modified supra shifter R154s due to the top neck of the shift boot is solid metal and has no play and can only go down so much on the taper.  Cannot speak for W55s.<br /><br />The OEM shift knob requires much more space underneath and you cannot screw it in.  Assume if you have an aftermarket knob this will be okay as long as there isnt a ton of extra distance beneath the knob required to reach the thread.<br /><br />Materials are good though, with happy with that at least.  Just go buy a non-OEM shift knob.
B000COVWWE|5|Perfect and cheap
B0038B4ANG|5|Superb.
B000EDOSNI|5|I have not installed this vent cover yet but it looks like it should work fine
B003FO2O1G|5|Great reception, simple install.
B00DSCZ0U2|5|Easy install took less than 5min. Fit exactly. Very satisfied.
B0021KII10|1|Not a great product. It lasted maybe 30min on my DA. The glue on the back does not last long. However it worked great while it lasted.
B004BHZR1A|4|This is heavy duty plastic and it is raised 1/8&#34; of inch or so. Note, you'll need a flat surface to apply this. Ships from China and takes a month or so. I think it was worth the wait now, but for one month I was regretting the purchase.
B004KNIEVU|5|package of 10 delivered as they said it would. was not described that the ring is secured by a 1/4&#34; bolt in through the housing. seems to work fine.
B008KCBTDM|1|They peal and lost color
B00R26RCVK|5|Clearly a very smart and well made product. Could tell just by taking it from the box it would serve my needs, well. Now installed, it stays put, is easy to clean and looks to possess a durability that will become essential based on my daily usage.
B007ZDZI66|4|Worked perfectly, the instructions were a little vague and had to go on YouTube to get a better idea on how to install it. Did not come with the knockout tool but template worked pretty good.
B00YED7J0I|1|The 3M tape strips are too thin to contact the door sill. The tape strips need to be much thicker. They fall off. Complete waste of money. If I could send these inferior products back, I would, but they came from China and the return freight would cost more than the product costs. Live and learn--Never Again!!!!!
B006MNLEWW|5|Just what I ordered for half helmet.
B0068FUSB2|3|It's ok but it does not work good. I got one about  6 months ago had put about 3000 miles on it ( my bike is still stock ) the bike has no to little Chang to it. I had removed it put the IRIDIUM SPARK PLUG. (CR9EIX) this is the colder plug and the bike runs very well WITH OUT THE GAS Mileage lost and also a lot cheaper upgrade
B00NTOJEGA|5|Worked as stated. Popped right in the factory locations, and used the factory plug. Very cool and different. 2013 Audi S5-cab.
B00Y1HSNLQ|5|Thank you so much came fast and easy to install ..5 star. Good job.
B009IHK8KI|1|Didn't fit returned today

B00IL80JGI|1|Installation was easy. Shipped with NO instructions. Once installed, the engine light came on it said &#34;reduced engine power&#34;. I called JET, the prompted me to unplug and unhook the battery for 10 minutes, hook everything back up and let it idle for a 20 minute period until the PCU &#34;learns&#34; the electronics. After hours of 4 attempts still no luck, called JET again and was prompted to get it reprogrammed with a TECH 2 GM scanner, that only a chevy dealership would have. Dropped it off at dealership, they tested the unit and failed to reprogram it because the throttle body was receiving ZERO voltage!<br />Codes P0120, P0220, and P1516 kept coming up. Throttle Plate Sensor Failure. The throttle plate would not move wit the new unit.<br />They had to reinstall my old unit which threw no codes whatsoever and worked fine afterwards.<br />Cost me over $125 for a failed reprogram and to reinstall the old one, hours of my time, and a day without my work truck all to find out that the unit I received was defective.<br /><br />So much for &#34;quick and easy installation.&#34; Very dissapointed
B00MHQALSG|2|Not bright. Can't even see it in daylight. Maybe half as bright as the regular bulb it replaced. I would have expected at least a comparable brightness.
B000BGM7QS|5|Worked great. I didn't realize that a flange came ewith the toilet though but will keep as a back-up. Hopefully won't need it though.
B003ZOH63W|4|Seems to work fine,but right after I installed it I sold the motor home.
B000EFMU4A|3|They are not particularly well made or very sturdy but I guess they will work for a couple years for me since I only put them on the winter tires.<br />They are cheap though, which is good.
B001O7ICPI|5|NGK its good stuff! Fits perfect and preforms better.
B00LAEO87Q|5|Great Product!

B000NZR8AW|5|My goodness. Delivery no problem. Everything went as planned. System sounds so good, I rarely play music. Sometimes just want to hear the rumble. Installation no problems. Takes about two hours. Got Corvette, get this system.
B007I6FS10|3|Too bulky, otherwise can work for your application.

B00753S8CC|5|Love it!
B00KBPQMN8|1|looks ok but took a month to receive item. Bought another product which I received in 4 days.
B002M9LBIC|4|An excellent wheel and tire cleaner, but don't fool yourself into thinking it will leave a shine on the wheel or tire afterwards.
B000FOIJXQ|5|look good only time will tell better than silicone already
B00F5VX3U8|5|Perfect during the winter no more scraping!!!
B00S0OGQT2|5|Very good
B00P2XLN24|5|Perfect
B007TY82L4|5|I took my time installing this part correctly but it worked like a charm. It seems like a quality product made of metal and was easier than I thought to install. I did the other side 2 years ago. I saved a lot of $$ as I understand that the dealerships are over charging for a replacement part made of breakable plastic. Very pleased with this product. Thank you.
B00157TGXY|5|Definitely helps reduce smell

B0024GQJ2G|5|I love it!
B00DM0URP8|5|I am so amazed of the handling of the car. I noticed a difference as soon as I put it in drive. I encourage every Lexus owner to own this kit. Especially the LS400 owners. It handles like a beast now!
B000F1906O|4|Arrived promptly, received what was ordered, fit vehicle as advertised.
B00L844JBI|5|Bolted right in!..Awsome lighting!..I am very pleased with my purchase.
B00NLV2D6E|1|4 days. That's all they lasted 4
B00D42AFS8|5|This thing is awesome. Originally bought it to power some led lights but it performs as stated. Such a little thing is capable of jump starting a car. Awesome.
B00JRE38EA|5|They were great 5 star no question
B002US3ZE8|5|Loved it!!
B00O83OAGU|5|Fit just as described.
B000COCAC0|2|Dont ever plan on taking them off. These no-drill flares will allow grit to get inbetween the seal and the paint and will rub right through your clear coat, through your paint, and down to bare metal. Then the metal will rust, and you know the rest. Dont get me wrong, they look great and function great on a truck but you wont be able to take them off without horrible looking rub lines on your paint, AKA flareburn.
B0040CRTK8|1|These do NOT fit the door panel of a 2005 Dodge Grand Caravan. They are too short. The Amazon &#34;this item fits your car&#34; statement was wrong.
B00B6FWHDG|5|Fits and looks great
B000K024VS|5|Just replaced at 70 K on my Frontier with the rear rotor.  The factory Unit still had life just the stopping distance was going up.
B00HWKL5GY|5|Just as advertised,  pretty sweet decal
B0069WNZ0A|4|Great deal.  So far so good!
B00278V2XM|5|Very bright and work great
B006RLAJCK|5|Product and delivery met expectations.
B0050H3AO6|1|I've used many stands and this one is sub par. The material and finish is nice but the design is very poor. The support arms are too long which creates the wrong angle to lift the bike and doesn't provide enough leverage. After backing bike onto a 2x4 and obtaining an assistant we were able to lift bike. The rear was suspended twice as high as the two other bikes on stands next to it. Just poorly designed.
B00EDSTV00|2|Several of the beads were broken off.  It just looks cheap.
B00I9SK8WK|5|100% of all people who have unprotected sex die.
B00XM1078O|3|Update from my original review.  The driver's side bulb failed after less than a year.  I started to get error codes about 3 months ago, but would then the code would clear.  Completely failed about 2 weeks ago.  Although these bulbs aren't expensive, they should last much longer than 1 year.   original review : Easy to install.  Look great
B0049L8X2I|2|Re used the originals because these are so thin.<br />120000 miles on the originals and no comparison to these cheap things.<br />For emergency use only I suppose
B009DJYXAW|5|Great item
B003VCDABU|5|These Qwik Valve oil drains are fantastic.<br /><br />I've been using them for over thirty years on six different Saabs [from an '80 Saab 99 to several mid 1990's 9000 turbos], a Chrysler minivan, an E46 2003 BMW 330, a 2001 Chev Suburban and an '07 Hyundai Sonata.<br /><br />Some of the valid complaints are for people who may not have realized the clearance of their particular drain pan. It seems that most newer cars have a plug which drains laterally, from a side or the rear edge of the oil pan. For most of these applications, there will be no problems at all with the installation or function. On the '03 BMW 330, [F-109S] the angled nature of the oil pan meant I needed to install a spacer segment [Quik Valve part number ADP-109] so the valve itself could be installed correctly.<br /><br />On the 2001 Suburban [with a 5.3 liter V8], the threads on the oil drain required adding an extra gasket so the Qwik Valve F-107N [[ASIN:B003VCD7UE Fumoto F-107N Engine Oil Drain Valve]] would be oriented with it's release tab away from the ground. [see pics for right and wrong orientations] The Quik Valve folks are aware of potential issues with low ground clearance, especially if you're off-roading or four wheeling, so they do sell a clip that provides an extra measure of 'lock' on the tab to keep it from pivoting open if you snag a branch, etc. The clip is part number LC-10, a small plastic locking clip which goes on top of the closed valve.<br /><br />Ok, in use, after it's installed: you will never want to ever go back to an ordinary 'wrench it off' oil drain plug again. You can get the engine up to operating temp [which allows a better, quicker, more thorough drain] without thinking of the hot oil splashing around your wrist, let alone juggling a very hot drain plug. You simply reach the small locking tab, pivot it up slightly, then rotate it toward the drain port [approx 90 degrees] and the oil will flow. On most applications, I use a short section of clear 3/8&#34; ID tubing to guide the oil into the catch pan. There's literally zero splashing, which also makes cleanup a breeze [no Speedy Dri! no sweeping! no cardboard!].<br /><br />For a few years, before the Fumoto company made a drain valve for the redesigned GM 5.3 liter V-8, I used a Fram version of the same idea: no tools required, it used a small recessed one way valve which was depressed by screwing on a special brass collar, attached to a short drain tube. It barely functioned, as the diameter of the drain hole was reduced so small [perhaps less than 1/8&#34;] the oil took forever to drain out, even when pretty hot. This is not a factor with the QuikValve fitting: when you rotate the tab, the brass and stainless steel sleeve pivots [looks like it's inside a nylon bushing] to open a good sized hole, approx 5/16&#34;.<br /><br />Makes oil changes easy, clean, and quick. You'll never want to go back. Buy one for each of your cars and you'll be set. [save the old drain plug only if you want to be cheap and re-install it when you sell the car OR to remind yourself of what a pain it used to be].ing to guide the oil into the catch pan.

B00IK3L6IO|5|Great product.
B001O074JU|5|Installation was shockingly easy..<br />Took care of chugging-surging at light load or cruising speed, thought it was a tranny problem.
B0013LF3ES|5|Bought another one since my buddy didn't have one & his tie downs came loose & damaged both our bikes...
B00V9HPH9C|5|Great product!
B00C7XX4AQ|3|This does not fit any 7th Gen maxima although amazon says it fit. It can work, but all the wholes don't line up. I was only able to get about 2 to 3 pins in and had to use zip ties.  It a slight bend in the middle, mostly from it being in a box rolled up. So i give it a 3 because you can make it work. So if your looking for an exact fit or replacement,  this is definitely not it.
B001PP4TY2|1|My speedometer is now messed up because of this damn tuner. I can't wait to return this and Get my money back to get a legit tune.

B0002MABGE|5|My golden retriever is too energetic in car that he can pull the barrier down. But if with smaller or quieter dogs, this is definitely a good choice to buy.
B0081STS56|1|Horrible, horrible, awful instructions! It take 3 times as long as it should to install. Most of that time is trying to understand the installation instructions!  Not a bad product. Instead of having it in 3 different languages, try 1, and make it understandable!
B0125ZXCCK|2|It was very easy to install, but the reception is terrible. I can hardly get any radio stations in my car now. I bought this as a replacement to my factory antenna that broke. I am very disappointed in the reception quality.

B008VQ23EQ|5|Works Great!
B00K5UIKFC|5|Finally got around to cutting and programming this key and it worked flawlessly. Do yourself a favor, don't buy an after market key for a Toyota vehicle, you'll regret it. Stick with OEM, they work. This key was bought for a Lexus ES330 after 4 previous after market keys were purchased. This one worked, the others did not.

B00GHTG41C|5|Overall I'd give this product a very good review. It looks great, was easy enough to install, and really does provide much-needed storage space on the Ruckus. Watch the video and refer to it often as you do your installation. It's helpful.<br />A couple of points however: the panels snap into the frame nicely and are (mostly) held in place with zip ties which are cleverly concealed so they don't show (ties are included), although as noted in an another review the space formed is not waterproof. Not a problem for me since I don't plan on doing a lot of wet weather riding anyway.<br />However I did not like the way the rear panel was secured. It just snaps in, no zip ties, with only a little fold-down tab on one inside lower corner to hold it in place. So I drilled four new holes in it and used extra zip ties to anchor it. Unlike the other ties used, these can be seen although since they match the frame color they're inconspicuous. This made the rear panel much sturdier and stronger feeling.<br />One more thing to be aware of: I installed mine right before I put on a new metal rear luggage rack I also ordered from Amazon. The two items, this storage kit and the rack, aren't designed with each other in mind; both attach to the rear seat bolts and the storage unit is in the way of the rack's support brackets. I had to trim the bottom corners of the rear panel of this kit with a hacksaw to make it all fit. Not a big deal, just something to be aware of.<br />Also- the underseat storage unit formed by this kit does not lock! In some pictures it might look like it does, but the lock you see in the manual's photos and the video is a little key-operated helmet hanger on the left side of the seat. You just lift the seat, which does not lock, to get into the compartment, so it's not a good place to leave anything you want to see again if have to leave your scooter unattended.<br />These are minor quibbles really, and should not discourage anyone from buying this kit and installing it him- or herself. As I said, storage on the Ruckus is badly needed. This kit provides it, looks neat and professional, and is sturdy enough once the rear panel is secured as I've described. I've given it my best recommendation here despite its minor flaws.
B000CO88C6|5|Great tool at a great price. Worked as advertised and I highly recommend.
B007V2BFQ8|5|Perfect fit for 2015 Lincoln MKX

B007XE8C74|4|Worked as advertised. Easy to use and read and cleared codes out I needed.
B012LG24T0|5|This Auto Backseat Organizer is great.  Its working perfectly behind my seat to store all the kiddo's small items in.  No more stuff laying everywhere.  They are happy to pick it up and put it in its place.  Also helps keeping the kids from putting their feet on the back of my seat now.  So thats a bonus and so far it wipes down easily with a baby wipe.  A must have for any car.  Store just about anything from kids stuff to backup tools.  I purchased this product at a reduced rate to review and love it.
B001GMX15C|4|Great product
B000C55WQ0|5|no problems yet
B000JU6BCW|5|This is a big hit in our house. Saves water but shower still feels full force. Great invention!
B000AOMQ80|5|I have some large areas to mow that are pretty much an acre of weeds that once was a dumping ground for the former owner and no matter how much I clean it up I still run over stuff on with my lawn tractor and tires go flat. I put tubes in the front but the rear tires are still tubeless so I purchased both the 10056 & 10008 to see if it would help. My neighbor has having a similar problem and swore by this stuff. All four tires now have now been Slimed and no flats in the past few months and I’m pretty sure I’m still running over stuff and this product is sealing it off as it occurs. My neighbor has also no had a flat. I did use a similar Slime product on a truck tire that was always losing air to the point it needed to be pumped up about every week and after filling it with Slime it never leaked again. This stuff has worked for me and it’s definitely a lot easier than trying to plug the tires (I have used the Slime plug kit on my truck tire and it has held up well) or pulling those front wheels off the tractor to patch a tube. I pumped some of this into my wheelbarrows and so far they’re retaining air much better than before I did so. For the price and ease of use this will always be my first choice. However, you do need to remove the valve stem before you put this stuff into the tire/tube.
B00NH76Y80|5|Easy to install, they look great!
B004XH69MY|4|These worked great for my application. I felt they could be a little more diesel but they get the job done right. I run these on my XS Power D3400 and they work flawlessly. Battle Tested, 4 Stars
B005H13SKQ|5|Installation was easy, plug and play. Several years later they are still working. Love them
B0007VNZN6|1|after I got in installed we noticed a bend that must have happened in mfg before paint, as there is no paint marks, just the bend
B0087NAZM0|5|Exactly as advertised!!
B003RWM1RI|5|Worked perfect.
B004KEOYRM|5|These look very nice
B007KPV9MG|4|Decent build quality, but a little pricey.
B00K5YCHHA|4|Very good product.  I'm pleased.
B001449ZBQ|1|switch was a piece of junk  markings for wires could not be read when the key was turned the mechanism felt like it was full of sand push to choke would not return to no choke position
B007WQQGYY|5|This tool simplifies this job better than any other.
B00DSGHOGQ|5|Great price for a fully synthetic motorcycle oil.  Most of the local autozone or Walmart have very limited selection if 20w-50 so it's rare to get a deal on them.  Convenient to have it delivered to your doorstep.
B00WJPG4JU|5|Perfect!
B003VASH2Y|5|Great
B00ZR7MKUO|5|Great and good packed for shipping.
B000IY5DWI|5|Worked very well
B002AKFA94|2|The unit comes with no assembly directions.  If the unit is touched, even gently, by the car, it falls over.  The base is not weighted.  To resolve this problem, I applied Velcro to the base and floor.  Over priced for poor quality.
B0002RNSJ6|4|Great product
B00BOVDCPE|5|Love it.
B00D42AFS8|1|This item is not able to jump start a car. I was in a bind and needed to use this, and it didn't work. Very disappointing especially after spending 100 dollar. Do not buy this if you want to jump start cars.
B00HYKB0D0|1|No color match
B001O0BJUK|5|Great deal.
B009DK8A64|5|good fit
B00FFAX2A0|5|this product meet all my expectations and more it was easy to install<br />I had my brother install it and he installed 2 in about an hour.
B002P8T22W|5|It was great.  A perfect fit.  Saved tons of money.
B00CC302PQ|5|I have had these installed on my car for over 6 months now and have had zero issues with this hid kit. This kit is awesomely bright and gives such a feeling of safety while I'm driving in the dark, because the lights illuminate the road at least twice as far as halogen bulbs.
B009XQ5VZQ|5|This is a fantastic product!  Love this! Fast shipment too.
B003DNL8ZC|5|Perfect fit on the Corvette
B009S2ZQNM|5|This was probably the best idea I had to buy these. I broke the handle on the driver side of my 93 F-150 twice before I decided to buy metal ones. My door opens so easily, I should've got these earlier. I used to have to yank on the handle hard in order to get my door to open not anymore. Extremely fast shipping. Clearly marked for which side of the truck they go on. Easy install just need a phillips head to remove the panel and a 8mm to install the handle.
B00P6OOAC4|5|Installed a week ago on my 1997 Toyota Camry 4 cylinder. Rides much higher and smoother. A pleasure to drive.<br />Fast shipping
B000N9PJ7W|5|Nice product, exactly as advertised.<br />Quick delivery too.
B007Y87SKG|5|they work
B00WTCL32Q|5|Awesome awesome awesome id buy 100 more if I had more tails that needed lights
B001C6L5UK|1|This does not fit an 04 Mitsubishi Lancer ES. It's a good 3 inches taller and doesn't fit into the door.
B0029TQDLA|5|The placard holders work great.  When I was using just the placard to hang on my rear view mirror it started to tare.  The plastic holder prevents this from happening.
B004J0TA3A|2|The original equipment radiator cap does not fit correctly on Prime Choice's radiator. I had to chew up the sides of the radiator cap opening just to get it on. It's even more difficult getting it off! Spend the money and buy something better.
B00108CKIG|5|Works well, easy enough to install. Denso makes a good product
B000C31J9G|4|Got the filter pretty fast and eaiser than going to town to try to find one.
B00NQQ21K2|5|The perfect fit for fenders.
B0007LVJ20|5|Exactly what I needed.  I did have another one, but I didn't keep it greased and oiled, the salt rusted it and in about 2 years it was done.  Just keep this lubricated where the shaft goes as well as where the key fits.
B00EUVYPV0|5|Perfect fit. Awesome price. Can't go wrong with this replacement.
B0002SQYV4|5|A clean classic ginish
B00BITIEOG|5|Definite life savor
B006AG7ZM4|5|As advertised!
B000COTOZ6|5|Came quickly and works great! I like to use the copper plugs in my MK4 Jetta GLI 1.8T. It's chipped and these are a range colder than stock plugs. Smoothed my idle and acceleration, very very pleased.
B00WRV2SLY|2|I bought this for my Honda Insight where Honda, in their infinite wisdom, saved few bucks omitting to install console/armrest. I was looking for quite a while to find something like this; I felt like a sucker just by thinking of original Honda console (actually by checking the price and what would that cost me).<br /><br />I ordered this expecting that the hub of this console has a tight fit in cup holder – not so.  I was on the verge of returning it for that reason and for overall cheap appearance and execution, different color tones of plastic parts. I am still in the process of figuring out how to install this console, give it stability and get the function of the armrest, which I really miss in my car. I am giving this item 2 stars for acceptable price and solution to a bizarre problem; it’s not going to add to car esthetics, though.
B00B45A1SQ|4|As expected, fast ship.
B0042HI6CQ|5|good price good part
B001FTLNMO|4|what i needed
B00Y1HSDGG|5|GREAT!!!!!!
B00SXBFYEK|5|Fits exact , took out the old and in with the new .  Plus it arrived two days early.
B009Y33MH2|5|Beautiful but ordered by mistake
B00LML7GJY|5|Charged my Moto-G very fast. The advertised 18 hour solar charge was pretty much spot on (sunny days here). This would be a great survivalist charger. I can't speak as to how superior this is to other solar panels because they're all kind of slow. The LED flashlight is a good plus (again, for emergency use). I experimented with this for a web cam, but it doesn't continually supply power, it has to have the phone (or other device) continually try to charge. This is not an external power source for devices.<br /><br />Works as advertised. Small footprint. I like!
B007DKQGQC|5|Good quality sticker. As expected.
B00NS6YYW8|5|A very good product.
B000E2B292|5|It lubes....
B003L643KS|5|Great product
B000VL9WTS|5|A life saver! Nothing like taking the top and Doors off the Jeep and enjoying the open air. This gives me the freedom to go anywhere and not worry about the possible rain storm. Great for a quick cover when shopping or Overnight when not at home.
B00SVE5ARU|5|Excellent buy. Installed and works perfect. The price was phenomenal, as Advance Auto wanted about $200. for the same thing. This is brand new. I'm a cheapskate, and this fit my mindset totally. I'd certainly buy from this seller again without hesitation.
B000C9MXXQ|5|Great OEM replacement shocks.<br />2005 Yukon Xl denali
B012IJWW1A|4|These c-streaks are badass taillights!! But the need more imporvements for the fitment
B001I7ENN4|5|Purchased for my 2012 Honda Accord. They fit like a glove and matched the interior perfectly. Very pleased.
B0002UHVX2|5|Delivered as advertised.. I would buy from them again. The product works great and easy to install...
B0052O8K7Y|2|The product is very nice but no instructions with it. I emailed the company asking for instructions and they said you don't know how to install it. Cause we don't have instructions. So I won't be buying from them anymore
B00BITKRXW|5|Exactly as original.  Went right into place.  Have had no problems with this.
B009AKCUCC|5|Perfect!
B00B9DZL9W|5|These are wonderful but my tap water is so dirty that they clog quickly and when they are clogged the water pressure is greatly diminished. They don't last long for me, but still worth it as it's not the fault of the product that our local tap water is disgusting. I like that I can tell when it's clogged and change to a new one rather than just continuing to use one that is past its usefulness. I like that my animals receive filtered water to drink now.<br /><br />Also - I'd definitely recommend using one of these when filling a pool to avoid metal and other stains that are a pain to remove. I had metal stains on my fiberglass and after removing them this has helped me avoid having them return.
B000GU24HG|4|I would give 5 stars but when it's very hot here which is a lot the material sticks to the paint on my bike, which messed up the paint job. Needs different inner liner.
B00WFS6BYY|1|Terrible low quality plastic! Didn't fit properly the the chrome sides kept falling off! Absolute rubbish! DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM!!!
B000C9PL8A|5|Arrived punctually, works well.
B0080E4MNE|5|Perfect fit on my 1997 BMW 318i (e36, M44 engine).
B001SIFGCK|5|As expected.
B005GL8X16|4|It fits perfect and I am very happy with my purchase.  I can always count on Amazon!
B000CO8ZQU|5|Worked Great! Not much else to say.
B00U6G6LY2|5|Cheap easy running boards.
B001UE4JOI|5|Still works great
B009XFDYNS|5|right part works fine THANKS
B00L89GVAA|5|Quick shipping, excellent quality
B0030YWM0Y|5|I mounted these on my CTX700. I used the existing horn circuitry to drive the relay included in this kit. The relay is connected via a fused line to the battery.<br /><br />These horns have authority, with volume, without sounding shrill. My stock horn reminded me of the cartoon character, Roadrunner. This horn is completely different. The dual-tones are low and strong. They remind me of a 7-series BMW, or perhaps a S-class Merc.<br /><br />I can feel them shaking the bike through my feet and hands - they are that strong.
B009DJU63U|3|This does not fit any 7th Gen maxima although amazon says it fit. It can work, but all the wholes don't line up. I was only able to get 2 pins in and hade to use zip ties. So i give it a 3 because you can make it work. So if your looking for an exact fit or replacement,  this is definitely not it.
B00B3UXHVA|5|Perfect color match. It took a case to paint the bumper and one flare for a Tacoma.
B00D1CQVIY|3|Holds up so far, blue screw on male plugs are very hard to get to thread on, make sure relay is water tight, minimal water got in it and made my light bar spaz out but once I cleaned the water out it is working good now.
B004MUI7OA|3|The pump arrived loose in it's shipping box but was intact in it's shelf package. The day I installed it was the same day it failed, within an hour afterwards. I've had new parts fail out of the box before, just not after working as they should for a brief period of time. Even though the price was hard to beat( $70vs$306), it wasn't enough for me to get another one before deciding to get rid of the car.
B0083SL82A|3|Obviously not the greatest quality but these also didn't fit my yamaha fz09. If they would have fit they would have been fine.
B0037UAP1E|5|Grabbed this on Amazon and it arrived well before expected date. Upon arrival it looked fine on my 2015 Rogue, but I noticed that the foam bumper looked a little curved, away from the car. I contacted Technaissance and asked if this could be repaired as I've seen it on other vehicles contoured to the bumper rather than away. Instead, on the same day I submitted my issue,  they contacted me and told me that they would send a replacement instead, free of charge. Two days later, I now have a new contoured bumper guard that looks like it wraps my bumper and it looks great!  Thanks Technaissance for the great product and even greater customer service!
B000IOKU12|5|Really helps shifting and braking. Looks fantastic.
B005JDXLRW|5|I got it for my daughter for her 61st birthday and she was thrilled.  She, (of course) has a Cruiser.  Thank you.
B00SZK1420|5|Awesome product very bright and they give my Silverado a tough look, I get a lot of looks and people ask me if they are hids. I have told friends about them and they have also bought them and love them, two thumbs up keep up the good work OPT7!!
B002UC4SWM|5|Item seems to work well. If it saves even one appliance or electronics item, I'll consider it money well spent.
B00LWTTIG0|3|It looks good but its not yellow its kinda green!
B004VDGJUM|5|I got tired of repainting the steel wheels every spring on the 2005 Rav 4  , For the price these are a great alternative. Made the car look like new, My Neighbor (a car guy ) Thought they were chrome wheels and had to walk right up to them to see they were just wheel skins. I just hope they last a couple years I will be very happy.
B0007IJR22|5|Got this at a great price compared to some other websites, particularly for the size.  Instructions say 3 caps per gallon!  I think that might be a bit strong as I was very bubbly!  Results for one vehicle (a 10-year old vehicle) was a nice wet-looking shine.  Very pleased!
B012X49ENY|5|This thing works like a charm. Between my lunch bag, my purse, and my notebook, I have a lot sliding around the car at times. This organizer has really come in handy on vacations with the kids. I always have a place for my purse. If you need some space in your car or you don't want your stuff sliding every which way, this little hand bag holder is awesome.
B004GCXG4A|5|Perfect fit as a replacement for oem parts.
B00514ANRA|4|Thin material but serves its purpose and I like the design. Happy with it!
B00SISDC5Q|5|I stuck it on there and had a little trouble getting the wires right. But I looked it up and now it works like a champ! I
B00H7LPKKU|5|Works great wish I had bought one sooner
B0002AJR8E|3|alright does the job
B00Y0AG0Y6|2|These ventshades didn’t meet my expectations. They don't fit quite well. All four interfere with the windows when they're raised up.
B000E0Z970|5|Securely placed inside the box. Looks very well made. I'll be taking it today to get installed along with a rebuilt compressor my mechanic located.
B0045LXI0Y|5|Perfect fit and they arrived very quickly. I had them on the trailer the day they arrived and were in the water later that day.
B000WEPI4M|2|Didn't fit my vehicle
B000GZAUQ8|5|Perfect OEM  parts. Does the good work to  improve gas mileage.
B007W57Z18|5|Perfect fit
B009T8M0ZW|5|The sunshield fit my 2010 Beetle convertible perfectly.  The picture shown in the listing is wrong, because the sunshield does not come with the mirror cutout as shown.  The cutout is not necessary for the convertible, cause the rearview mirror is mounted on the frame of the car, above the windshield. Great item!  :)
B005MZX9EC|5|Better than expected! Looks great on my car. Just the right size.<br />Great way to increase CHD awarenes!<br /><br />The only thing I wish is that it came in half red and half blue the CHD colors.
B000C809AQ|4|Fit 02 Grand prix w/3.1 put about 5,000 miles on, works fine.
B000IG20RW|5|All lucas products are are top quality. I recommend their entire line.
B000C2ZJNY|4|02 Grand prix w/3.1 put about 5,000 miles on, works fine.
B0002SR7TC|5|Makes changing my oil a breeze
B00IK69IRC|4|It works good.
B000E8X5AK|5|great item
B00B51XW26|5|Perfect fit and color match..
B0066QQVJG|5|great item
B00JB4T6L0|1|Sent me product that fits a BMW when they are meant for a Freelander 2
B007OXCIB0|5|Great product food adhesive property
B00796UQHA|3|If you like tiny things....THIS IS PERFECT! I thought it was going to be a bit bigger. (Insert &#34;That's what she said&#34; Joke here) For the size of my Nissan xterra....It just looks......dumb...which is a bummer because I don't even use the radio. So, it's virtually useless.
B000CRDMS8|5|Timing belts were as expected--fit perfectly and installed easily. Very pleased and satisfied with purchase and with seller.
B008PRHXY6|1|I'm keeping it, but does not fit 5 door accent at all. It's for pre-2012 3-door.I'll cut up and make use of it somehow.
B00DHQVVS4|5|Perfect match
B009PTTQSE|5|This part saves u $400.00
B0053YFDNM|5|works great
B0009TUDZ4|4|It was just the filter I needed - Thk You
B00EEEB77I|5|Gets my dog dry fast.
B003VVSFL6|3|Case was attractive and appeared well made, but was too bulky and too big for our use, so we returned it, and are just using clips at the moment. I had ordered it before we picked up our new car so hadn't realized.
B00DUFC9QU|1|Don't  fit my car
B00B5ZY07I|5|Worked just like they should.
B002UQRXNY|5|Good
B000E2CVI8|5|Love K&N.<br />Great company great product. I used this filter for my 2004 Honda Aero 750cc
B00VFF0PDG|5|Exactly what I wanted, easy to apply.  If you want this for your car it works great.  Holding up so far to lots of rain and humidity.
B00L1RUUZQ|5|A good set for a good price!
B000CC0HZ4|4|Worked very well keeping clothes unwrinkled and clothes did not obstruct the view when looking in the rear view mirror. The bar itself was a little bit obstructive, but not enough to deter from using it.
B00519VAAY|5|Excellent
B000H6O2XS|4|Worked good. Came off a little where I didn't clean it very well but just put on a couple more coats. This can was more than enough to do my steering wheel.
B005FI5J5I|3|It doesn't sparkle even outside like shown in the picture.  I love bling and this did not do it for me.
B00BYGM6I8|5|Was looking for comfort on long 600+ per day miles. On the CTX1300 and using the 8808 splined adapters, these were the answer.<br />They aren't so big like the HD or Wings, but still let you rest your foot comfortably. Adjustable forward or backward with 3 different holes to mount and then you can rotate them to fit your posture/style. Still strong enough to hold 200+ lbs when standing on them. Look good and don't look like after market once installed. Comes with bolts needed to mount to the splined adapters. Can use them as passenger boards also. If using them on the CTX1300 for pillion, you need the 8807 adapters.
B00NJV7FJ6|4|This worked perfectly with my daughter's water bottle. In general, however, I am going to stop buying water bottles with soft nozzles.  My kids just can't resist biting on them.
B00OQRM2ZE|4|It's a sticker, it should be a magnet that can stay on glass, but ok...
B007MVI5QQ|3|Seems OK but smaller than the original.  I'm sure it will work just fine.  It fits the F1482 Pump perfectly.  Just have to push the strainer on all the way to make sure it seats well.
B0093U3TFG|5|Great price way cheaper than the CDI version.
B000EDOTCS|5|Handy little device.  Got a new camper that needed a dispenser over the sink.  With this one, it can live over the sink but can still travel outside under the awning when eating out.  Very easy to install.  Couldn't ask for more.
B00RA0DIUC|5|Worked perfectly. Huge savings!
B00F8LEB9W|5|Work perfectly...
B00C1OKKW6|5|The Darth Vader part of this steering wheel cover is actually quite subtle. You hardly even notice it which is fine by me. I didn’t necessarily want a Star Wars cover but this one fit my needs and hey I’m a fan so why not. I wanted a cover that slips on, wasn’t too expensive, and was available via Amazon Prime and this one was it. It slips on fairly easily but you will have to use some hand strength. It’s nice and tight and a perfect fit on my Chevy Avalanche steering wheel. The texture feels good. It doesn’t get hot or sticky and it’s being used in one of the hottest places in the country (Fort Myers, Florida) however it does add a lot of thickness. Overall, this cover checks all the boxes and I’m very happy with my choice.
B0050EFHWW|4|It seems to function correctly, but the seat is smaller than I expected.  The seat does not fit a 225 pound man's rear and other parts of his body that needs to go inside the bowl.  When I received it, and opened it.  As I was reading the instructions, I discovered the floor mounting brackets were missing.  That got me a little POed.  I expected better service from such an expensive pottie.  I will suck it up and find or make something that will work as mounting brackets.  Overall I would recommend it to others, after letting them know my issues with it.
B00E1SO5KS|5|Great brakes no brake dust.
B000BGM89Y|5|Works perfect, love the rubber tires
B00ETBBKC8|1|I loved the look when I pulled them out, but as I went to put them on I realized they did not have holes in seat cover for head rest. I ordered the ones with separate head rest for this purpose and no holes. Bad design, they suck. I was and am disappointed.
B004JO7J1Q|5|Very nice & easy to clean
B004GDTGTS|1|This product does not fit a 1981 Chevy K-10 like it says the holes don't match up to the outer finders.
B00RM327NG|5|Amazing tracking system
B004GCO2SE|1|This product does not fit a 1981 Chevy K-10 like it says the holes don't match up to the outer finders.
B001LHVOVK|5|Great item at a great price.  Works like it says it is supposed to.
B009WEUZ3C|1|Wrong item received
B005ZY6REO|5|I got an 09 Yamaha R6S... Easy to install & perfect...
B00UCIXGK6|5|Awesome
B00E5P180M|1|Terrible oil smell. Cost me a trip to shop thinking my car was leaking oil.
B00GBVHPNW|5|Be sure to check the size.  They shipped me large gloves, which were the correct size for me, but you might need another size.<br />Much better then the Home Depot gloves I was going to get as the air can flow right through the gloves.
B0007ZAJ4A|1|Started falling off after a week. did not hold up with the heat in florida. spent two hours adding a need liner fabric and now have to redo it all over again. This time with a better product.
B002PQQF7Y|2|Cheaply made. You can see the dried glue around the edges. Fits okay but not tight.
B005TCG7EC|5|It is a really nice product
B00D2I0IAE|5|This does exactly what I wanted.<br />It a few minutes it found 2 problems not reported by the Toyota dealer for my 2014 Fortuner 4WD<br />Download the PC software & you have a complete service report for each car you test.<br />The first fault found was an ABS error & the second an air intake valve stuck, both fixed with a reset after checking.
B008C10DQU|5|arrived on time, new condition as described, working well
B0078U91NM|2|Product does not come with the required straps.  This should be mentioned.  I frequently order this product from other vendors and the straps needed to fasten the universal joint to the yoke are always in the box!
B00IUWLZMW|1|Used it for about an hour then it short circuited and died. The voltmeter reads 0 volts, and it will not accept a charge.
B002PQW6NG|5|Beyond expectation!! Great product.
B00BFE4XHQ|5|Fit perfect and very easy to install-  just snaps right in.
B00WPW6BAE|5|Really good wifi OBD2 device . it works better  than any other one i have tried in the market  . Dont forget to get the best out of this device , you should pay for the app if you have Iphone or Ipad . its range between 4.99 and 50$ and any of them will do the job . Highly recommended if you would like to save some money and not get ripped of by mechanics .
B000UVUAFO|4|Had to go over spots 5-6 times but it did conceal the scratches.  Was surprised it worked as well as it did.
B002IV3GT6|5|Exactly as described.
B00L4OE3O0|5|In honor of my beloved Son the seat covers are beautiful
B0053O9EUA|2|took it out
B00KTHWDHM|5|Great quality compared to other key blanks I've gotten. Fast shipping!!
B0024E6V30|5|Small bottle but keeps odors away well
B002XM5G70|5|mounted pump on a mobile spray unit and it performs the job perfectly
B004C6TYGO|5|Easy as Pie. Like all the others stated 20 minutes install.
B007XCN0XW|3|Did not fit my car. 2014 vw sports wagon. Front too small rear too big. My bad for ordering them. Quality was nice though. If they had fit I'd have given 5 stars.
B00FPVZVVW|4|Nice addition to my f6b.  Sleek and sporty which does no take away from the bike design. Gives the passenger lower back support as well as a sense of security.
B000CPI5ZK|5|just whar i needed
B00413MWQC|5|It fits well, though it does not cover the whole truck floor area (which I was aware of from a previous review).
B00943S48E|4|These are well made, but I couldn't figure out how to attach them.
B0007TQWKQ|5|Very very easy to use with great results
B000P50FSM|5|Great item and seller was very accommodating. I had to stop the order the first time because I realized I would be out of town when it arrived. Cover is easier to manage than I thought. And, yes, bummer you have to take off antenna each time, but c'est le vie.
B00UIU3FZ4|1|Terrible, really terrible. Installed after watching bunch of videos from youtube and instruction manual and got passenger side working without any problem, but driver side f****ed up the next night so that it didn't fully work for even 1 hour. As my buddy ordered exactly same one but is out of town now, I got to install his ballast on mine to replace the driver side. As I already tested driver side bulb connected to passenger side and working, it is definitely ballast problem. Started working so left the engine on for 10 minutes and the next morning, I came to work and when I parked my car in basement, it started flickering like crazy so turned off the automated lighting system and manually turned on the lighting system only to find out the driver side f ed up again. Just to mention, I got the 2012 chevy cruze checked in auto shop every electrical system/power train after the first ballast was messed up. When I had to use halogen bulb cuz i had to come home after the first ballast was messed up, it stayed on for 2 hours without any problem.<br />Well, i don't know what model your car is, but it might not be the best choice. Honestly, at least to my case, it's definitely not the best choice. Also, email reply from OPT 7 was that automated lighting system/remote key turning on the headlight doesn't go well with headlight. If you are definitely willing to give up the automatic lighting system which you probably also paid when buying the car, go ahead.
B006TMKXUU|4|The replacement lens works ok....just wish the clips were more sturdy as this is the third lens I have had to replace because of the flimsssy nature of the lens.
B00REE0LHC|5|Pretty nice material and shine.
B00P9OF04I|5|Truly an awesome product for the money. Sanded/cleaned and clear coat 4 times. Turned amazing.
B004LQAO9Q|5|Everything ok. I would buy again, very responsible
B00GG9FB8U|5|I was kinda sceptical about this type of product. I'm not anymore. It's easy to use and leaves a nice wax coat that shines well.

B00FQSS0HQ|3|The part worked as it should, although I had to drill the sway bar hole slightly bigger to allow it to fit.
B004XATHVQ|5|It makes me smile every time I step on the gas! Looks great & sounds awesome. Fairly easy to install also.
B003XGYDE2|1|Loud, under powered and gets very hot. We switched back to the battery operated pump for air mattresses. This one just does not have the airflow.
B002X6VXL4|5|work great at Sturgis rally helped  Several Bikers with dead Batteries.
B003K5S4NW|1|Pad doesn't absorb the glass cleaner at all and should be a few inches bigger.  I end up wrapping a towel around it.  Waste of money

B00GSAUHB8|1|I didn't like it. It's hard to put it away and stay in the windshield.. I can't return it because there's a hole in it that I can't figure where it came from
B00BK7LYSY|5|GM does not recommend anything but this for the transfer case.

B008FRFC8U|4|I'm very happy with the lights they work and look great .A good addition to my roadside service business I'm starting.I bought 2 of them
B005PX1WRW|4|Picture does not match the the actual covers.  You get a seat cover, headrest cover, and armrest cover for each of the front bucket seats.  I was a bit concerned at first, but purchased it anyway because the Amazon listing had the exact Coverking part number that I wanted.  It took less than 5 minutes to remove the seat from my '01 Sequoia, and installing the cover took another 10 minutes each.<br /><br />I was very happy with the overall fit and how good it looks.  The gray color did not match the original leather seats, but it was close enough.  I deducted one star because the opening for the seat controls did not align perfectly.
B00FB3GDXE|5|Perfect, no complaints about the sticker. Now if only people would just read it...
B000JNTEJG|5|Arrived as expected and very easy to install.
B000IY3KA0|5|Perfect fit for 2005 E320 CDI. Great stopping ability and low dust output. Will buy again.
B00EC2CG9U|5|Love these things! They come in very handy for all sorts of varied jobs in our motorhome. From securing drawers while driving to keeping hoses and cables organized, they are fantastic!
B000CPA5X0|1|First header cracked
B006MNX9AW|5|Fits great! I love this jacket
B0001EVUEK|2|Did not fit on my Honda Odyssey. Had to cut both ends off in order for it to fit.
B00EK59BZG|5|FAST SERVICE and a GREAT PRODUCT
B002OP423K|5|Great brake line! I have replaced the stock line on my Sportster and my Honda CM400 with Magnum Shielding lines. Just beware, this listing is for the line only and DOES NOT COME WITH FITTNGS.
B00KJ8JMH0|4|The ballast's are slow to warm up but the light output is good. I used these on a retrofit BiXenon projection headlight kit. Used a relay to work the shutter and keep the ballast on when I switch to high beam.
B00230N5CA|5|I received this product and was amazed with the quality. Warn makes a product that will last a lifetime. If you want a product that will hold up for the long hall this is it.
B00BDEP5ZM|5|works!
B00LKXJ3DQ|5|Great tool. I usted it on my Mazda 3 to diagnose a check engine light. I used it with the OBD fusion app for iOS. Total cost for teh whole process was the cost of this tool plus the app ($12). Turns out the last person that put gas on the car left the cap slightly off. Just h ad to re-tighten the cap and clear the error code. Had I brought this to a mechanic they probably would have charged $100's just to clear the code and come up with who know what issues. Highly recommend it for anyone with cars that are outside of warranty. Eve if it tuns out you cannot fix the issue yourself, you can go to the mechanic and tell them exactly what the issue is, so less likely they will overcharge you. Highly recommend it. Also, installation was a breeze. Connected it to my car's OBD port, and the app recognized it right away (engine must be on).
B001JKXJF8|5|Fits perfect in my Ram 1500
B001BB4LBG|5|fit perfect , very happy with it.
B000AA4RWM|5|I bought these for my pop up and they work great, I just stuck them on with the adhesive tape that is supplied and then i put a bead of clear silicone around the whole thing and the screw holes as well.
B003UVCY00|2|Had it for 2 months and it stopped charging, it was actually a good flashlight till it stopped working.
B000NPUJQC|4|need more connectors ...
B00DNX92TQ|5|Works awesome, i cut the straps off clings well to my vulcan 900. I use the see through cell phone window for my garage clicker. To give you an idea of the volume it just fits a 1 lb bag of egg noodles in the main pouch, strange measurement i know but its spot on. Overall very satisfied for $20.
B005G8DAT4|4|good quality stickers
B000C5427K|4|Fits my 2002 F150 5.4 perfectly. It took 2 minutes to replace the old one with 150,000+ miles on it.<br />The old one still rattled and many say that means it is still good, but I have been using a lot of oil (over 1qt/1000 miles), but I am not sure where from (does not appear to burn oil, no oil leaks etc).<br />This PCV is an inexpensive part to replace when troubleshooting disappearing oil. I have no idea if this has fixed the oil useage problem or not, it has only been 50-60 miles since I changed it.<br /><br />update: it has been about 1000 miles since replacement and oil usage has dropped. Only about 1/2 qt used in past 1000 miles, so while not totally stopped, it has decreased. I will continue to monitor.<br /><br />2nd update: well, 1 year later and oil consumption is ~1 qt every 1500 miles, so the PCV valve was not really an issue, but for the price it is a great preventative maintenance item.
B000C5I2YO|5|Fit in an 1998 ford f150
B000IZ7WS0|5|bought these for my 85 corvette after checking the size,.  a super great buy on a box of 10 considering what the OE part cost.  the application data says &#34;does not fit&#34;, but that's WRONG - it was a perfect, form, fit, and function replacement.  two thumbs up and five stars.
B001FC74P6|5|Ordered as a replacement for a jack on my 2013 Surveyor by Forest River.  Arrived in two days.  The jack is heavier than the original, came with the shaft greased and works great.  The top plate of my original jack had been welded as well as bolted to the frame.  Since I couldn't get the plate off of the camper, I removed the top plate of the new jack and bolted the new jack up to the plate from the old jack.<br />Very pleased with this product as it is better than the original.
B002DU3S9A|5|I have two of these to keep two UB12500 gel batteries charged.  The first one has lasted many years so I expect this one will too.
B000C55L2A|5|My truck feels much better on the road now. Let's see how long they will last.
B007SPRQS4|3|it took me a while to figure out that i couldn't put the second metal hose coz there was not enough space for it to install under the hood, other than that it is okay
B000W7RITM|3|These were not the correct ones for a 2015 Toyota Tundra SR5 4.6L V8 Truck Crew Max
B003EP52DS|4|Take our time don't get in a hurry and it will look good.....I suggest a heat gun...and cut straight edges ..do not fold
B00075XCEO|5|Simple n easy install
B00496RDVA|5|Fit my Ford F-150 pickup truck just fine.  Didn't want to pay $90 for a part that shouldn't cost that much. The kit comes with a lot of parts, gaskets and mounts obviously for many different vehicle applications.  Also includes a new gas line and two hose clamps.  Instructions are minimal but if you can't figure this simple replacement out, maybe you shouldn't be doing this yourself. I removed the bed of my truck (2001 short-bed) with 2 friend to help me lift it off.  That seemed much easier than dropping the fuel tank procedure.  I found a good video on YouTube to review the procedure. The connector adapter supplied plugged directly into my existing plug so I did not have to splice and/or solder the wires.  I used the existing fuel hose to connect the pump because it seemed to be in good condition and just used one hose clamp to secure it. The fuel strainer they sell to match is smaller than the original but seems OK otherwise.
B00LO0M918|3|Work well, just to white of light for me.  Need a warmer color of light.
B0044ZJUGM|4|I am satisfied with it ,still trying it on my different cars
B000UUKMLC|5|I've been in the RV business for 30 years and Tekonsha has always made a quality product. And this brake control is a little work horse for the money. Great brake controller I recommend it to anyone.
B002INQ46Q|5|A good lube
B004RNR9BY|5|Nice hose and it has worked fine for filling my water barrels. It maintains its rounded shape well, so it is fairly easy to bundle it up for storage when I am done using it.
B005UQQARG|5|Good price for a good product.  Nicely made.
B000B8JUNY|5|Perfect fit for my 2003 Honda Accord. Cleared the CEL codes and problem solved!
B00M92T7GU|3|First pump sent out leaked every where,  got replacement and seems to be doing fine
B004HYPOI8|1|Shipped fine, looked really good.  However, was at least 1/2&#34; too narrow for my 2002 Dodge Ram 1500 tailgate.  Returned with no issues.
B00T94V1QK|5|They look great they smell funky like a adhesive smell but it goes away after a couple days ships from China
B00DUXYTF6|5|This thing has had some bad reviews, well. It looks cheap but it works perfect, it was easy to install and looks awesome! Went perfect with my aftermarket steering wheel. I put it on a 1995 Toyota Celica. So it's versitle!
B00BD52R02|5|Fit my ford focus great! Love everything about the whole set!!
B007Q4LAPM|5|worked great
B00DHQ6A08|5|This an excellent windshield visor. I use it ALL of the time. It folds up easily and does its job of keeping the steering wheelcomgortable to the touch.
B00AMMC5AY|4|The quality is great and is very comfy to grasp. The only reason one star off is because of the rubber smell even after washing and air drying it out in the sun. It doesn't smell too bad after washing but still leaves the smell on my hands.
B00EA0ZB7I|5|They are bright and both work
B004JBWYLE|5|Fast shipping, works great, and cheaper than dealership.
B001OCXBGI|2|Was what I expected, but came dented in several places
B0087FK24Y|5|Installed easy and a good fit, very nice for the price.
B00VS4M5NW|5|Perfect fit,easy to take on and off
B006TOIO6I|5|Perfect
B002KOAFEA|4|Works well on CTX 700
B00363M0TC|5|Works good no longer have problems with my Printer.
B000EQ767A|5|Good belt
B00C0CKGI2|5|Perfectly fit and color for my acura mdx 2010
B008BKVDLG|5|I purchased the smoke grey a few months ago and loved them. They fit perfectly over my prescription glasses and allow me to wear a half helmet without the expense of purchasing prescription motorcycle glasses. Purchasing the clear allows me to ride at night. Both pairs are durable and comfortable. I would recommend them to everyone. I forgot to mention that they stay in place even when experiencing buffeting.
B00KGIEER6|5|Works good
B00XRTM8FQ|1|Does not fit ALL Harleys, Will not fit my 2015 Forty Eight. Does not sit flush because the vent tube inside the tank hits the underside of the cap before it becomes flush. Even if i chopped it and bore out the cap a little I think the the twist mechanism would still hit the pipe inside the tank.
B00W67G2LG|5|Excellent!!!! NO problems perfect fit.
B004GDQA3I|5|This front bumper outer bracket worked very good. Good quality and bolted right up.
B00D4522AY|5|worked
B00S8KQCYW|1|came apart when my husband tried to put them on and they were a gift. very annoyed.
B000OCKHV6|5|Quality product, works great
B000KYWT96|5|Perfect!!!!!!!
B009RC2HVC|4|latch fits and functions perfectly.  the plastic piece fits ok, I chose to trim the excess flashing from the edges before installing....no big deal
B0049VVH1W|5|love these... they are a nice compliment, frame-wise, to my other yellow-tinted glasses... these are great for wearing anywhere dark sunglasses might seem inappropriate like the mall or the covered patio of a bar... they lend themselves that way if you want to be unique with your faswhion statements.
B00K53BM0E|4|Seems to have plenty of charge. Real test will to see how it is in a year or two. Good value and quick shipping
B00ROS4PB6|5|Worked great looks good
B000XH82O6|1|Did not come with the adapters to make it fit various types of car (even though rainex does make them), totally didn't fit my vehicle. sitting on a shelf waste of money.
B001MP12KE|5|works fine and I replaced it myself and saved over $300 due to my mechanic wanting $400
B008YFSBKE|5|Install was easy and works great!!!
B006RUH9I8|5|Worked great
B001Q22CJ8|3|Light output for DOT compliant bulbs is Great!  Not a bad product at all.<br />Streetglow definitely stands behind their products for the Warranty period (had two pairs fail in less than a year), and pretty hassle-free support (just keep your receipt).  Unfortunately, products don't last much longer than a year, if that.  Prices have come down from when I originally started using them so much better value.  Got tired of changing them yearly so went back to standard long life headlight bulbs and change every two years+ now.<br /><br />Side Note:  Don't recommend the non-DOT (they are really bright, but they burned up the stock wiring harness and bulb holder - $300).
B003SZWJTY|4|Was expecting it to have the bulbs and pigtail,it does not,quality and delv were all good
B00FS3C8AO|3|Top brackets were bent, Turning posts were welded at two different angles which made it hard to turn, although they do work satisfactorily.
B008RPH8GO|5|OEM pack, perfect fit, great value.  got both sides and easily installed them.
B002OUVL6G|5|Works perfectly.  Shipping was very efficient!
B00K170Z8Y|1|Poor quality
B009S9RR1Y|5|love it
B000BZ5108|5|Great bearing at good price.
B000XG8Q0W|4|I love the idea of these organizers.  However, they were bent at a weird angle that made them stick out awkwardly from the car seat.  This was an easy enough fix.  I bent them to a better angle.  The angle of the actual hook is good, but not made for a wide strap purse.  You will easily warp/bend a wide purse strap unless you widen the angle of the hook.
B003V5Q2D0|1|It makes a VERY LOUD NOISE!!
B00HU6IE32|1|skimp on this and you will be finding your self buying over 1,000 dollar injector replacement. Injectors will wash out much faster with larger micron particles that are able to make it past the fuel filter.
B002AKIAVE|3|As others have stated this tool doesn't work out of the package on a Mazda 3 2.3 as it doesn't reach into the pulley (tool not tall enough).  I tried using it without the dowel pin but it just kept slipping off the pulley.  Got creative and made an extension so the pin would reach the correct hole on the crank pulley.  Just attached a 1 inch piece of flat plate to the tool using a .5&#34; long bolt that matched up with tools threaded hole.  Then found a much longer bolt that will act as the dowel (appx 2.5&#34; and thin enough to fit inside the crank pulley hole).  Secured to the other end of the plate with a nut.  Worked on first try.
B001Y8NEX2|5|Good stuff
B004X973EA|2|don't buy
B00C7Z0BZ0|5|This cover fits just right. I own a 2015 Street Glide.
B00I795MFE|3|No idea if I even got an actual factory Subaru fuel filter. The one I received came in a Subaru box but looks nothing like the one pictured other than the shape. The box didn't even have a part number so it could be a knockoff box too. It's working but whether or not it works as well as a Subaru filter or how long it will last is a mystery. If it fails I'll revise my review. Just be forewarned that mine was raw metal,not painted black like every other factory Subaru fuel filter I've seen nor the one pictured. If I could go back I'd buy from somewhere else and spend a few more dollars.<br /><br />Also I should mention that Purolator actually makes the fuel filters for Subaru but they're version sold under their name might not be as good. This is even stamped as being made by Purolator. I would not recommend this seller to anyone. I'm giving it 3 stars because it fits and my car runs and drives
B00K2EVJ9U|1|It doesn't work.
B00RSOLXFM|5|Better than I thought! At this point, I only use in my BMW. I have not try using this product with the outlet yet. I love it so far. I might buy this again for my friend who help me fix my PC problem *see my other review for Avast&#34;
B00VYNF8S6|5|Perfect fit for 2006 Jeep Liberty. Took about 2 mins to replace both.
B00QMWQJRS|4|For the price very nice! Great fit and color matches!
B005NLQAHS|5|Excellent equipment. Works perfect 2010 cts.  Torque app pro in droid store works perfect with this device.  Free version is good to.
B001GJ7HCI|5|Does a decent job without damage car clear coat.
B002NUABUO|5|Used this on the undercarriage of my 2001 Dodge 2500 4x4.  I wire brushed the axles and underside first and followed the directions.  Worked great.  Followed up with Krylon black the next day.
B003KFR1HM|4|product looks good. Did not installed it yet. will post later
B00SSKUHAC|5|Great
B00E5OUOCQ|4|Love it. Sunshade arrived so quickly. I had measured the window and decided that the next size up was too large and this one would fit. It does fit but I wish it were just a few inches larger all around. Used it today and I'm sure it will be fine. We've had others and prefer this type of one piece that folds nicely to store in the door.
B0055DV8D0|2|These are fairly low quality bungee cords. I use them for securing my bike panniers. They haven't seen much abuse but they've already stretched the point of almost snapping.
B00W7YJMUG|5|​►Support the Troops: If you can't stand behind them,... -feel free to stand in front of them :-P
B00SOKSL0O|1|Nice looking  no directions ??
B004GC7A24|5|Works and fits like factory handle. Quick easy swap.
B009RHMZCI|3|Worked well, lasted only 6 months
B005T3ZI6E|1|Didn't work take just keep going and going
B007GRSNUE|4|My husband really likes these! I got them for him for Father's day. They run a tad bit big but he put some insoles in them at they fit fine. They kept his feet dry as he was riding during a downpour.
B0002KO4KA|5|Great!
B00TQ0S7QE|4|This adapter works well to mount the license on the front of my 2011 BMW 535i M-Sport sedan.  The alternative to using the tow hole with this adapter is to mount the plate to the front bumper by drilling holes in the bumper... NOT on my BMW!  The tow hole bolt is sturdy, but the single screw to secure the adapter plate is the one flaw in the design; the plate can be rotated if bumped.  I successfully tightened the screw using an impact driver; it helps to tighten the screw without damaging the screw head or threads.  The slots allow the adapter to be mounted parallel to the surface of the bumper.  Unfortunately, the front radar &#34;sees&#34; the plate in this location, but that isn't a problem to me.  Overall, a very good solution to the problem of mounting a front license plate in a state that requires it.
B00XMBEVN6|4|good product.Worked well but bolt included for wiring plug connection low tensile  strength.Use oem bolt
B000C54086|5|EXCELLENT product to tighten up steering linkage on my 1971 Dodge B300 (1 Ton) Van.  However, grease fitting provided with this drag link was a pain to install, in-part because No female threads had been cut for grease fitting.  A 9/32&#34; socket was finally found that fit the grease fitting provided, but the installation of grease fitting woulda been much quicker if the hole for it had been treaded, and a fitting that could be tightened with a 1/4&#34; or 5/16&#34; box end, or socket wrench.    Not very many home mechanics have a 9/32&#34; socket.  However, Vice Grips could also be used to install grease fitting.
B0091OE6K6|5|Hey, this little thing is pretty cool! I've constantly struggled with the shoulder strap riding up to my throat all the time, always pulling it down, the whole time I drive. This plastic clip has one part that snaps down on the lap belt part and stay there all the time. Then I loop the shoulder strap through the hook part whoever I put on the belt, slide the lap belt clip so that the shoulder part is positioned comfortably. And no more fiddling with the belts for the whole ride. Easy to install, easy to adjust with each trip. I can't believe I never knew about these things before!
B005KOZ25Y|3|a good working product for the price.
B0125HFPWS|1|Description of item is vague and misleading.<br />The item is not a decal in the sense of all others  I have ever ordered.<br />There is no background to the decal- which I thought would be white with the character drawn in black outline as it appears in the comic stripe. And as it shown in the image of the decal.<br />The decal consists only of the cutout  lines of the image (white) - thin lines that would likely not wear well on any surface or be easy to apply.<br />I plan to return it.
B00KALE064|4|It ok if it was black
B00IWO4K8O|1|They didn't snap into the buckle of the car that I was told they would fit in so no I didn't like them and I had to send them back and was charged shipping on each item which cost me more than what I had payed for them in the first place. So I'm not happy with the hole experience.
B001QGFW3M|5|did the job just fine. easy enough to install in just a few minutes.
B008CLLZVM|4|Great product would have given five stars but did not say it needs a bar across the front for installation which is not included.
B004ZF46R4|3|No hi-beam 02 ram 2500
B001GS0DJ8|5|Awesome Deal, great material and made in Germany,.
B000VKK0M2|1|Wrong thread pitch!!!  This pitch 14mm x 2.0 fine thread is for 2002 and earlier, 2003 and up is 14mm x 1.5 coarse thread, why would they say it fits my 2003?  Well it's already installed on my truck!! Good one Amazon!
B00I5GTNTA|3|not the exact same black color as normal rocker switches
B000BRJTZE|5|Great item
B003FWV5TA|5|Great quality, string is a bit tight but they keep the grip smooth & tight!
B008CS5OOO|5|Very light duty but seems to be working ok
B00H9S71LW|5|Works great
B000JSXZSW|4|Looks and fit great on my 02' SS
B001FHSA40|5|I installed this starter in my 2001 Corolla when its original starter failed (click, click). Helpful hint: Go to youtube to learn how to replace this! It's a lot easier to do once someone else has figured out the best way. Also, do an oil change while you put this in- you have to take out the filter anyway, why put an old filter back in? You may want to order one at the same time. It gets 5 stars because it does what it's advertised to do: start the car.
B00PXC5PNC|1|Rusting bolts ... fits very loosely
B00IS94KME|5|Fit perfectly.
B0058EHH18|1|The quality is very cheap.. Amazon stated they would fit my Mercedes.. The tool they used to see if these mats will fit are inaccurate. The seller will not charge u for shipping, however if u received them and they are not what u wanted, you will have to pay return shipping cost.. It cost me 14.00 to return. These mats are not the color u see .. Do NOT PURCHASE. Unless it does not matter. I only gave it a one star because u have to choose an option. My rating would be a -0.
B000P6USVA|5|Works great
B000CSPD7K|5|Works great
B00AWPHDJ4|3|Bag is great just did not come with the strap.
B000CGZ200|2|I bought these for my 2003 Ford Excursion 4x4 and they are not the easiest to put on.  The bolt that attaches them to the leaf is not part of the bump stop and therefore you have to get an allen wrench in to hold it in place.  I used a socket style and it protruded just a bit out of the top of the bump stop and I held it in place with vice grips.  I also had to build a stretcher to extend the leaf out to get it in in the first place. I also felt they were a little tall to begin with.  A better model would be the 9.9136R 2&#34; square universal bump stops.  I bought a set of those to use on my front suspension and they worked excellent there and would be perfect for use as the axle bump stop in the rear.
B00TS9ZYWI|4|Vehicle used in: 2000 Dodge Caravan 3.0 Litre<br /><br />This oil did seem to work like it says on the label while I was using it, I saw the oil stick high up on the dipstick much more than the Mobil-1 (Full Synthetic) I previously used and far more than the Pennzoil (Conventional) High Mileage with Lucas Oil Stabilizer. It didn't stop the aged engine cold start grinding noise in this application, though. It was my only time using Magnatec at the time, I drained Mobil-1 out.
B00UGDAVKU|5|It's good as advertised! I hope this will prolong my battery's life!
B009DK4RM0|5|I ordered the wrong item
B00188V1OW|5|I bought this for my 2014 ninja 300 and it fits perfect! Made of great material as well. Super durable!!

B00B2FM8D4|1|Extremely small!
B00I97MA3G|5|I have been using the regular SQUASH fragrance several times for over a year now, and also the SAZAN SQUASH once. This is the first time I tried the DRY SQUASH fragrance of EIKOSHA. Just like the others that I've tried, it also smells good!  The fragrance is very much alike the regular Squash but with a hint of GINGER.  This is a great alternative to cut the boredom of using the usual SQUASH fragrance for a long time.
B00CBZCW0I|5|Item as advertised
B002P8EMK4|5|very fine
B004AHGEJU|5|Great product and fast delivery
B00IJ4T7DK|5|Very adjustable! Works just like you'd expect.
B006XWNTSY|4|Kinda small, but stuck well. Have to be pretty close to read it. I like it. Shipped in three days.
B000778PDK|1|Very poor weak setup disappointed, wasted my Money on this set up, very upset
B00L521CM2|5|Perfect fit and they arrived very quickly. I had them on the trailer the day they arrived and were in the water later that day.
B0091B56TO|5|I have been using these filters for about 3 years. I have a 2011 Dodge Caravan with the first year they came with the Pentastar engine. I tried the Fram a couple of times. I think the Wix are better quality. I have 110,000 mile on the van now and it still doesn't use enough oild between changes to add any.
B00LEBLI82|5|A MUST HAVE for any camper trailer lighting,,,,,Ordered 10 and will be ordering 20 more to finish the job...These lights are whiter and brighter than the ones I had been using....The whole family agrees..  Just FYI i received the lights 1 day sooner than was promised....GREAT JOB !!!!
B005CDYKWO|2|Bigger than what you think but still cool
B00B3BKM1M|5|This is a eye rolling convo starter. and I'll tell you what it's lasted a whole winter on the rear window of my explorer and has even faded. I love it.
B00M0CBV9U|5|We used our roofbag for a 7 hour drive and it worked perfectly.  It took me two tries to figure out how to load it properly- that is, lower in the front, higher in the rear, in an aerodynamic  &#34;wedge&#34;. Now I know.  The zippers were a little stubborn at first to close, the trick is not to open them as far as they go, just stop about 3&#34; short of completely open. I really like how I could just pack it away when finished , unlike the people I see driving around with the permanent hard varieties. Great investment.
B005JU5UX8|5|So far so good, no problems
B00EQ0LGE4|4|So far it has worked great, lights up the night, great for night fishing and off roading, recommend sealing up the sense with silicone because of all the water issues that can happen from a leak, and it is also incredibly annoying when the water is behind the lens.
B003VCD7UE|5|These Qwik Valve oil drains are fantastic.<br /><br />I've been using them for over thirty years on six different Saabs [from an '80 Saab 99 to several mid 1990's 9000 turbos], a Chrysler minivan, an E46 2003 BMW 330, a 2001 Chev Suburban and an '07 Hyundai Sonata.<br /><br />Some of the valid complaints are for people who may not have realized the clearance of their particular drain pan. It seems that most newer cars have a plug which drains laterally, from a side or the rear edge of the oil pan. For most of these applications, there will be no problems at all with the installation or function. On the '03 BMW 330, [F-109S [[ASIN:B003VCDABU Fumoto F-109N Engine Oil Drain Valve]]] the angled nature of the oil pan meant I needed to install a spacer segment [Quik Valve part number ADP-109 [[ASIN:B0043QWWRG Fumoto Valve Adapter ADP-109 (12mm-1.5)]] ] so the valve itself could be installed correctly.<br /><br />On the 2001 Suburban [with a 5.3 liter V8], the threads on the oil drain required adding an extra gasket so the Qwik Valve F-107N would be oriented with it's release tab away from the ground. [see pics for right and wrong orientations] The Quik Valve folks are aware of potential issues with low ground clearance, especially if you're off-roading or four wheeling, so they do sell a clip that provides an extra measure of 'lock' on the tab to keep it from pivoting open if you snag a branch, etc. The clip is part number LC-10, a small plastic locking clip which goes on top of the closed valve.<br /><br />Ok, in use, after it's installed: you will never want to ever go back to an ordinary 'wrench it off' oil drain plug again. You can get the engine up to operating temp [which allows a better, quicker, more thorough drain] without thinking of the hot oil splashing around your wrist, let alone juggling a very hot drain plug. You simply reach the small locking tab, pivot it up slightly, then rotate it toward the drain port [approx 90 degrees] and the oil will flow. On most applications, I use a short section of clear 3/8&#34; ID tubing to guide the oil into the catch pan. There's literally zero splashing, which also makes cleanup a breeze [no Speedy Dri! no sweeping! no cardboard!].<br /><br />For a few years, before the Fumoto company made a drain valve for the redesigned GM 5.3 liter V-8, I used a Fram version of the same idea: no tools required, it used a small recessed one way valve which was depressed by screwing on a special brass collar, attached to a short drain tube. It barely functioned, as the diameter of the drain hole was reduced so small [perhaps less than 1/8&#34;] the oil took forever to drain out, even when pretty hot. This is not a factor with the QuikValve fitting: when you rotate the tab, the brass and stainless steel sleeve pivots [looks like it's inside a nylon bushing] to open a good sized hole, approx 5/16&#34;.<br /><br />Makes oil changes easy, clean, and quick. You'll never want to go back. Buy one for each of your cars and you'll be set. [save the old drain plug only if you want to be cheap and re-install it when you sell the car OR to remind yourself of what a pain it used to be].clear 3/8&#34; ID tubing to guide the oil into the catch pan.

B0040CTUAA|2|Nothing more to say then the pins being 2 narrow for my 2011 Maxima. But yet Amazon says it fits.
B0044GO0RA|5|Excellent.
B00XJU6LM4|5|Stick nicely on my car door...
B000FCEOSC|5|Perfect fit! I love this sunshade. I would buy this again.
B00OBA5FYQ|5|used it on my boat easy install very water proof .Can now keep cell,ship shore radio and weather and AM,FM radio fully charge in boat
B0030CNG5Q|4|mechanic installed it and so far no issues.
B006H81ZOY|5|I was happy with the purchase!!! the delivery was on time!!!
B00BVB49XG|1|They sell bad stuff  i bought a switch for my h3 and had problems from the time it was installed  the auto shop had a had time to figure the problem out,thought it had a bad wire somewhere in the door , after a 3 hour bill it was thenew switch i was sold  the took it apart in front of me watching and found that someone had this switch apart before and soldered it in several places but got it crossed on the board with the door lock and driver window switch and was causing a short in the switch,  bad business, selling repaired stuff
B003CGDPVK|2|I bought this because I like the look, but after having it on for a couple weeks it ended up sagging quite a bit and the fittings come out of the channel anytime I go on the highway. I've tried tightening the straps and making sure it is centered. I think it was just a product that wasn't made with quality in mind. I use it to keep my dog from jumping out but I don't feel safe if I keeps falling out of the channels.
B002Z3113K|5|Jacking up a range rover used to be scary. Not anymore. These things are phenomenal. High quality. Easy to use. Super sturdy.
B00NILZEBI|1|I bought this after measuring my spare and it's not only a sloppy fit it's cheap material .  I called the point of contact the day I received it four days ago and still haven't heard back.<br />guess I got a raw deal
B00X7HS5LY|5|I just received this product today and it couldn't have been better timing. It's 110 degrees here in Southern California and just as I was about to take my kids out, this arrived at my doorstep. It was really easy for my to put them on the windows of my Nissan Pathfinder, and they fit perfectly! I put them up once we parked and it helped to keep the car cool while we shopped. It was really nice to come back to a car that wasn't an oven and it helped keep my kids comfortable until I was able to turn on the air conditioning. Great!
B00RSOX5BC|5|Love it!
B00CLDXGNC|4|I'm happy with this product. It's a great value for the price and I have had no issues with build quality. I would recommend taking a close look at the picture to make sure the shape of this item is really what you are looking for. The narrow part is quite long and the wider part is only about half it's total length. This is neither good or bad but I could see how some people may not be expecting that.
B00N42T340|5|Worked great!
B010EOBXWA|4|👍
B001CHA3C0|4|It works.<br />I don't have a thermometer connected to my cooling system to tell any difference.
B000VSY4HG|5|Nice set, great value and product.
B00BV4D97K|2|As much as I wanted this product to be amazing, It really didnt meet my expectations. I didnt expect a miracle worker or anything, but I had hoped for a noticeable difference, which I didnt get.  I used a borescope to view into the engine for a before and after comparison and when it comes to carbon build up on top of the pistons and on the walls, there was little to no noticeable change.<br /><br />I followed the directions exactly and let it sit for about 30-40 minutes instead of just the recommended 5 or 10 minutes, but again, really didnt get much in term of results.
B00TMHZINQ|5|I am absolutely in love with my seat covers they are gorgeous I would recommend them to anyone they fit perfectly for my hyundai Accent. Shipping took no time and I was very happy to see that the the seat covers came with separate head rest covers to avoid tearing.From my personal experience I have tried to purchase car seat covers from other places and they were more money and less effective for my car so I would absolutely recommend buying this product. Overall this is worth your money.
B00GBBDTXM|5|Love it. I added it to my 2012 Toyota Tacoma.
B00IAIPAHM|5|Really enjoy the Mossy Oak brand graphics. I do duracoat and cerakote as a hobby for a couple of years now. I'v used the vinyl wrap a few times. I've had great results with the Mossy Oak and Real Tree brands. I spend twice as much on &#34;Gun Skins&#34; brand and it was crap!!!!! This is an easy way to make your old scatter gun look cool. Youtube and exacto knifes are a must........
B002G29LLE|5|Great applicator.
B007WQQNQA|5|A must have for equipment/automotive mechanics.  You can almost leave the homemade jumper wires rolled up in the tool box with a powerprobe,  as you can instantly supply whatever your testing with voltage or a ground. I say almost just because you just never know what else you might need to troubleshoot. The case is really nice to. Its been riding around in a rough riding service truck for months now and still looks new. Wish i would have bought one sooner.
B0023VGDMI|5|Looks just like new.
B007CZPLHS|5|The head lamps look great. I didn't receive the starter though. They came to my house 2 days earlier than projected. That was amazing!
B00P80GEES|5|Very competitively priced air filter. It is flimsier than your average filter you get at autozone, but the material seems tough enough to hold up for what it's intended to do. Would definitely buy again.
B002MEJDKK|5|Great!
B004SSAF82|5|the best for protect my Subaru Forester 2014
B005N53C9I|5|These were my roommates and she absolutely loves them they are very easy to install and durable we both love them.
B00BUS3AKS|5|This is an awesome purchase. If your Forester didn't come with it already, I highly suggest you buy one !!
B007M0UBLE|5|Great quality for any dame fan!
B004JV6OMO|5|Works exactly as they are supposed to.
B002X1JWTY|4|good experience
B0068OCPKA|5|Giving it 5 stars because I immediately saw a difference in 1st and 2nd gears which was awesome. Took me 2 hours to install but I didn't have a rear tire stand. I recommend so far.
