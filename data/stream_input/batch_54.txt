0385484518|4|I am a senior in high school, and chose to read this book as part of a class assignment. However, it was more like a last minute time choice, since I got it without knowing what it was about or what to expect from it. I believe this book really gives you knowledge in the subject everyone loves to ignore, which is death. Not everyone enjoys or is comfortable talking about it, but there is no way out of it. Because everyone one day will have to go through that experience. Sometimes I think of what would it be like when I am dead or when I am dying; and I hate just the thinking about it. That is why I truly respect Morrie the way he took upon living his last days with so little strength. That is why if life were closing the door one me, I would not just look back and smile. Only a true man or women would do such a thing. Therefore, I did enjoy the book for the most part. However, I must admit there were times when it was difficult to keep on reading it since it did not capture the focus that wants to keep reading. The reason why sometimes it did not do this was because it only really talked about one main point in both these men's lives. And to be truthful at some points that could be kind of boring. Nevertheless, I would recommend it to anyone who really has doubts or questions about death, or at times, like myself, are scared of the fact that they must go through it at some point in there short lives. However, I believe that for many you will have the joy of being introduced to one of the most well respected man in this world; as a teacher, a husband, father, and friend.
B00UENHBAU|5|GENIUS!!!!!! But forgot something...
B000002N1E|5|love this cd prince doee ir again with the gold experience 5 starz plus
B0091REZMW|5|great game to play with your kids. The game is a great way for you and your kids to spend time together. so again great game
B00005JKZ3|1|The only thing good about this film were the special effects. Everything else was downright awful. It was boring, the acting was bad, the jokes were weak, and the action was uninspiring.<br />I physically hurt just thinking about this film. Please don't waste your time.
1451675046|3|I've read about one-half of this book.  It is written for a lay audience, but at a level that seems more juvenile, e.g. directed toward adolescents.  Or toward someone who has no background whatsoever in the sciences?  Not sure if I would recommend it.
B005G4TJI4|2|They need to get a new director and new script writer.. They just keep getting worse and worse.. Get rid of the Witwicky's.. It was funny the 1st time,now everything is just drawn out.. I never saw it in the theater and just bought it on blu ray.. I'm regretting it.. I don't understand why they don't use the original voice for Megatron.. I won't watch another one.. They should add the Dinobots,and make Devastater like in the cartoons,5 robots merged into a giant one,not a cross between a cement mixer and garbage compactor.. Cmon,what a shame.. It could be so great if someone actually cared about it.
B00AREIAI8|5|I love this game so much! It is so fun and I love taking care of a virtual horse, since taking care for a real one is so expensive. You should definitely get this game. I love it and I think you will too. I also am glad I made a review even tho I did this for free gems
B00H7KJRVY|2|I was really looking forward to seeing this movie but it turned out being a big disappointment.<br /><br />Ben Stiller is one funny and talented guy in other movies I've seen that he's acted in, but in this movie, not good. He didn't seem to be &#34;in character&#34; and definitely not the kind of film where you forgot you were watching a movie and got totally drawn into the the story. His acting seemed contrived and not in keeping with the kind of character that Walter Mitty is, for the most part.<br /><br />I'm giving 2 instead of 1 star, for the gorgeous scenery shown in Greenland and some other shots. Other than that, this one is a snoozer.
B005D9MUWY|5|This is one of the best keywords I have had for Android. Works great with the Note 3 screen size.
B009738XXM|4|I'm not an expert on music, but I really like Jepsen's music and the consistent sound of her music. She included some other famous musicians like Justin Bieber and Adam Young (Owl City) and regardless of what you think of them as people, they added a nice touch to her music.
B0010SKUYM|5|I loved this book.  Rothfuss' first novel is a fantastic introduction to a highly anticipated fantasy series. I can't wait to start the next volume.  And I will: RIGHT NOW!
B001NLKWLW|5|Hard to say what caught my interest, but i loved the story. I lived the book, in Australia as well as in England.
B00IRMQADY|5|I recommend this to anyone!  I enjoyed the perspective of a &#34;free&#34; man being forced into slavery.  You'll appreciate the juxtaposition of the beautiful bucolic south with the treatment of the slaves.  The beautiful scenery made it all the more heart-wrenching.
B001ANSS5K|5|Loved the story of a lonely girl looking for her Paper Town. Brings light into the struggle of teenage years.
B009HUB40Y|2|Needs to be more challengaing and fun with more bonus rounds to earn the special items different levels need different colors or something.....!  Why is it called Booty Quest?
B00407PNY2|4|Steve McQueen does it the best, excellent movie.  While dated, a total classic.  Hollywood's tough guys hopefully, all take notes from the master.
B007SYWFRM|5|I was looking at the app store when I came across this game! I am having so much fun with it. I am sick and it has kept me entertained! Great game.  &lt;(^_^)&gt;
B004LROUNG|3|Another great law drama from Grisham. Good for a relaxing escape from day to day life if you are a Grishsm fan, you will enjoy this
B000R9J3X4|5|If you are new to this exceptional band, this is not a bad place to start.  Shirley Manson's vocals are outstanding!  This is well worth the 5 star rating I am giving it.  Get yourself some garbage... you will not be disappointed.
B00KY7PEAA|5|This game is really entertaining for a teenager. I love this game a lot. It's full of strategic sequences. Get this game, you won't regret it!
1594746788|5|Beautiful photos. Finding the dog is a fun challenge with my 3 1/2 year old grand-daughter. She is really good at finding Momo
B006MW3UZW|5|We love this show.  The acting is wonderful and the storylines are great.  We enjoy this time in history and seeing how it affected the wealthy and their lifestyles.  Although the story is fictional, I am guessing the wartime storyline has some factual basis.  Also, I imagine the Earls and other such royal titles lived in the grand style that is depicted in Downton Abbey.  My husband and I love antiques and this show is a treasure chest of antiques during a great period in history.
B00005JNA2|5|Maybe I sound biased because Richard Linklater's 1995 film Before Sunrise is one of my ten or so all time favorite films, but this improved (and I thought that would be impossible!) sequel to an infinitely great film is truly the best film (so far) of 2004. The screenplay, co-written by director Richard Linklater and stars Julie Delpy & Ethan Hawke, is probably one of the most refreshing of this decade. It succeeds on so many levels because of the development of this relationship and the fact that Delpy and Hawke have such a three dimensional knowledge of these complex characters-no, human beings. Fictional of course, but they are still the most humanistic screen \\"couple\\" I've ever seen. <br /> <br />          Jesse (Hawke) and Celine (Delpy), separated for nine years, are undeniably the soul mates often described in their conversations, the ones that dig deeper than small talk. On a book tour in Paris, where Celine now lives, Jesse finds her watching him through a window as he absentmindedly describes the book he has written, which concerns two fictional lovers who meet and spend a night together-quite obviously autobiographical, when the question is implied by an interviewer. From there on, the two reunite and spend a brief but unforgettable afternoon in Paris, wandering the streets. <br /> <br />          The screenplay and direction are flawless. The dialogue and its delivery is so natural, so uncontrived I was convinced even more that these were real people that I knew. After all, I've waited nine years too (okay, not really, I only saw Sunrise a year ago). Linklater just observes all that is going on without overly glamorizing it. Delpy and Hawke take this dialogue and make it into their own-they are those Celine and Jesse as far as I'm concerned. Some of the best acting this year can be found in Sunset. <br /> <br />          The city of Paris serves as a fluid and dreamlike backdrop to the graceful and powerful, bittersweet and engrossing talk. Sunset is well filmed, and embraces just enough of Paris, which in fact would be more noticeable upon the inevitable second viewing. This city has never looked better on the screen! <br /> <br />          I liked the fact that both Jesse and Celine expressed their true feelings through an art form, he with a book, and she with a song. This clearly conveys the message that there still exists romanticism in each of them despite each characters' biting cynicism. Although they never once said a word along the lines of \\"I love you,\\" you know throughout the entire film that they are still in love with each other. Maybe I am reading too deeply into this film, but I strongly believe that the first place that the two go, the caf, is almost like a complete reenactment of the train sequence in certain ways-it is the beginning of their journey and each place is mutual ground where Jesse and Celine are not under pressure, but they can just talk without interruptions or worries about the past. <br /> <br />          By the time the ending came around, I held back tears in my eyes-out of happiness for these characters. If a film can do that, it's a winner in my mind. Those last words of the film leave you wanting more, but they are also brilliant and have stuck out in my mind amidst the philosophy and deep discussions. I won't ruin it, but the ending is just so amazing because you know that something good is going to happen. <br /> <br />          Do yourself a favor and see Before Sunset before it's too late, and then buy yourself the soundtrack as a memory of this beautiful film so that it is not forgotten until the DVD release.  <br /> <br />THE VERDICT: **** (A)
B0083ZRAJS|5|I loved that the character, Dorothy is so positive. The lion was a bit goofy, and I love goofy. I mainly loved the characters.
0446677450|4|I do not know how to realise the recommendations given in the book. Anyhow I enjoyed a lot while reading. Thank you.
B000002BQK|5|In 1997, Mariah Carey had just gotten out of a bitter divorce and was now expected to achieve the success she had once had with her ex-husband, by herself. Did she succeed?<br />Well, this is where this album, Butterfly, comes in. And the answer is a stunning yes. This album truly shines in every form and fashion, and why? Because the true emotion put into every single song makes the album worth listening to from beginning to end.<br />She truly put her heart and soul into this project. When people thought she'd crack from the end of her marriage, she did the opposite and bounced back with what? Herself.<br />Songs like \\"Butterfly\\", \\"Breakdown\\", \\"Close My Eyes\\", and \\"Outside\\" seem to put to rest any negativities Mariah faced in her past, and make these songs great to listen to and try to tackle your own problems with. The cover of Prince's \\"The Beautiful Ones\\" with Sisqo is beautifully done. You can tell this song is tackling with her divorce. <br />Lead track, \\"Honey\\" is a great song that hit #1 and stayed there for 3 weeks, with Puff Daddy (now P. Diddy) taking the track and making it what it is, it's truly a great collaboration and makes you hope they can get together again. <br />You can see there are some good uptempo songs here, like \\"Honey\\" and \\"Babydoll\\", but this album is loaded with the ballads, and those are truly special on this album. \\"My All\\" is a brilliant new direction for Mariah with a Spanish Guitar and sexy vocals, no wonder it hit #1 as well. <br />\\"Butterfly\\" is a grand piece of excellence on Mariah's level, which shines with personal emotions, great vocals, and the best lyrics she's ever penned. Yes, she did take a chance by diving deeply into Urban music, but she had to do it, because she's always had that soul inside her, but never had the chance to express it. Hopefully, she will continue to put herself into her music, and not become the not-so-real \\"popsters\\" that female artists such as Britney Spears have become to be. <br />So, if you'reasking if this album is worth your money, the answer is a definite YES.
B00FUZQYBO|5|If you're looking for a book that will instruct you step by step on how to be creative, this is not the book for you.<br />This book is not a formulaic instruction on how to be creative, but rather speaks strongly to the environments and structures that help creativity flourish.<br /><br />This is a great book for managers, lovers of Pixar & Disney, and anyone interested in an organizational approach to invention and creativity.
B00BLCHZC2|5|Excellent plot and action.  The violence is realistic but not gratuitous or unnecessarily graphic and entirely necessary to the subject..  It's not a Hollywood interpretation.
B003WUYRGI|5|I love the dictionary so much it is very important to me it is greatly appreciated to me it is very good thanks
B00005JO9J|5|DVD in an amazing condition, fast deliver and good price.  Very happy with my choice. Hope have another opportunities.  Just wish the other seasons were cheap as this one,
B004FRX0MY|1|It sucks!!!
B008IJTFYW|5|really great for sleep. If youre like me and can only sleep with sound. so its really good and relaxing.
B00H3GZMIE|5|Great voice and talent.
B0090KZDSK|1|I have never not completed a series once I've started it but I will not purchase any further books in the Crossfire series on principle! Entwined with You was a huge disappointment and reeks of money grabbing laziness on behalf of Ms Day and her publishers. The ending was a crime against writing and is almost grounds for complaining to a consumer rights commission. It came out of nowhere and left me feeling like the author just got bored with the book and randomly decided to stop. The book prior to this is made up of Gideon and Eva saying I love you for approximately 70 percent of the pages. There is very little in the way of plot, instead we are inundated with repetitive sex scenes and pointless dialogue. The fact that there are a further 2 books planned astounds me and points further to where Sylvia Day's priorities lie. I'm sorry to say artistic integrity was sacrificed for the chance to squeeze more money out of loyal fans. I'm saddened as I truly believed this series on the basis of the first 2 books, deserved a good conclusion. I've read most of what Sylvia Day has written (usually in one sitting, such has been the quality of her work) but I feel she has truly let herself down with this one and lost a loyal fan
B004GYNPL2|5|I have been using mSecure for a while now, it works great. Because of so many password combinations I entered them into mSecure and stored it on my Kindle Fire HD. I figure with the Kindle being Password protected and then needing a password for mSecure, I should be covered. Better instructions would be helpful, it took me awhile to figure  it out plus I got help to learn how to save the entries.
B00FJ7YDV6|4|it could be better because it says free but to get the full version you have to buy it.also it's not really a challenging game.I'd say good for ages 4-7. :)
B005ZOBNOI|4|An easy, incredibly enjoying, and captivating read.
B005D9MUWY|5|This app saves me a kazillion keystrokes.
B000HAB4KS|4|I like the movie due to the special effects and the story behind the Matrix.  I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes action/drama.
B007SYWFRM|4|very addictive and fun.
B007J4T2G8|3|I have to give this book 3 stars because it's a page turner. I didn't think it was written well. You can definitely tell it's a middle aged women writing out her fantasies. I didn't find the 'juicy' portions of the book to be all that 'juicy' or salacious. Though there's a cliffhanger, I refuse to buy the next book.
B0020M99LC|1|I like the bond episodes but this is not there best work.  I would save my money and rent something else.
B0015DROBO|4|If it were not for the slow start, I would have given it a 5 star rating.  I choose this book because of the movie advertising trailers.  I like mysteries with complicated plots and &#34;The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo&#34; is one of those stories.  The book actually has several plots and none were apparent until the end.
B003O86FMW|5|interesting! Especially since I saw the movie first. It was fun to find the differences! I definitely recommend it to fantasy, dystopian, and action lovers.
B002ZG9846|5|Ah, [[ASIN:B002ZG9846 Kick-Ass (Three-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo + Digital Copy)]].<br /><br />The young cast, led by Aaron Johnson, really shines. Characters are about as well developed as a vehicle like this will permit. Nicolas Cage is fine in his supporting role - he contributes just the right amount of father-figure.<br /><br />Hyper-violent in a cartoon-ish way (but I've never seen a movie I consider too violent - it always freaks moms out when I say that).<br /><br />Ya gotta get past the shock of the language from 11-year-old Chloe Moretz (\\"Hit Girl\\"). It's very very funny, but I wouldn't have let my daughter say them things.<br /><br />Not for kids, not a cinematic triumph, but it gets my highest recommendation. Kick-Ass is probably one of those movies you'll hate yourself for enjoying.
B00DHKKN6Q|4|I haven't played it enough , but when I have , it's a very fun game. I'll see how I feel as it gets harder on each level...Haha.It's worth downloading the free app and trying it for yourself.
B00571F26Y|5|Very well-researched and excellent information. After having my twins, I found that the ONLY healthy (& effective) way to lose the pregnancy weight was by ditching the grains.<br /><br />Didn't know all of the issues with wheat specifically, but so glad that I do now. As soon as I finished this book, my twin toddlers and I became wheat-free . . . and to tell you the truth, it really hasn't been difficult. Since we eat primarily whole foods anyway and are very careful w/ our diets, the only issues we have are when we go to a family member's house.<br /><br />It's been a couple of weeks and I've lost the extra 5 lbs I put on during the holidays--and my head feels clearer. Not sure if the twins have experienced any positive effects yet (they are 2 years old), but it makes me feel good to know that by ditching the whole wheat in their diets, I'm no longer feeding them such inflammatory foods . . . foods that can potentially lead to dozens of chronic health issues.
B00I5EONHY|5|Adorable children's movie.
B00F87ZUYG|5|I was really over the &#34;Z&#34; word since 2010 but I got sick one weekend and started binge watching Walking Dead and was hooked! So much leads up to Season 4 that I don't want to spoil anything with details.  Let's just say this is a story about people surviving in extreme situations and it elicits a lot of emotion from the viewers.
B00FW5PI0U|5|I was hesitant to buy this album until I sampled one of the tracks. I'm sad now that I waited until Christmas Eve to buy it, although I'd be fine listening to these songs any time of year! Their versions are fresh and full of energy, and so much fun to rock out and sing along to. Great band, great cover songs, well worth the purchase.
B00IRISI42|5|I could not turn the pages fast enough!!  It will be hard to wait for the next John Puller book!
B00GH4RKYM|3|Liked the original better, the affects  where good but the first one was truer to the storylines<br />I would recommend this to those who did not see the first one.
B00AHSIQWE|3|I know everyone loves this film, but we found it very difficult to follow.  Reviewing the previous films might help. Also, the music track overwhelmed the voices which was very annoying and contributed to the confusion.  WHY do film makers run the music so loud???
B0089LOG02|5|Shows a part of our history I was not aware existed. Very informative!
0525478817|5|If you're a John Green fan, I have one thing to say: This novel invoked more emotion than Looking For Alaska.<br /><br />If you're inexperienced with John Green, I'd like to reiterate that this novel with make you laugh and cry and probably very upset. It follows Hazel Grace - a teenager with cancer - on a journey that begins when she meets the fantastically crafted character of Augustus Waters - another teenager with cancer.
B00003000M|5|I'm not a die hard Marley fan, but I've been listening to one of his most popular albums for several years. Hearing the songs on this album seemed a little weird the first time around but soon I became used to the remixes  and ad-ins. After I heard it a few times it turned into my favorite album.  I buy a lot of CD's. This is my favorite in a long while. I also recommend  the Jimi Hendrix Blues Album. My favorite song on the Marley album is the  one with Lauryn Hill. Also, I like the one with Busta.
B001B3MCQK|5|Very relevant and timeless lyrics.  poetry. beautiful. Has already made it to my favorites of all time list.. Have been telling everyone I know about it so they can hear for themselves.
0896760839|5|Janet Arnold's books have been well used by me over the years.  I have made several costumes from each of her books and thrilled with each result.  The documentation and drawings are excellent.  However, these books are not for beginners.  All of the drawings are shown reduced on grid that will have to be re-sized for each wearer which can be very time consuming depending on the complexity of the design.  The patterns are historically accurate and portray how the costumes were cut out and constructed in their day.  <br />I wish I could find undergarment patterns this detailed.
B00BWBHIUG|5|I'm a 20 year old who has been through some stressful times this year and the soft music of the game  is literally my greatest relaxation time!!! In love

B00AEFY3DQ|5|Perfect fan movie. If you are a Trekkie you should see this.
B00008OLIC|4|After going on cruse control for most of the decade, Motley Crue pulled it together for what many would consider to be their masterpiece \\"Dr. Feelgood\\" (1989).<br /><br />Newly clean and focused, for their fifth album, the band tapped Bob Rock (Metallica) to produce their new CD.<br /><br />To many, \\"Dr. Feelgood\\" is regarded as the bands finest hour--their crown jewel. And While `Dr. Feelgood\\" certainly has many strengths; it suffers a few drawbacks as well.<br /><br />Musically, \\"Dr. Feelgood\\" is probably the band's best work since \\"Shout at the Devil.\\" The band--Vince Neil (vocals), Tommy Lee (drums), Nikki Sixx (Bass) and Mick Mars (Guitar), gave a one hundred percent effort. Unlike the past few records, the band didn't just coast. Their performance and Nikki Sixx's songwriting was top notch.<br /><br />Nikki Sixx penned a great collection of songs, so when the CD is good, it's very good. There is far less filler on \\"Dr. Feelgood,\\" then their had been on the Crue's last two albums, \\"Theatre of Pain\\" (1985) and \\"Girls, Girls, Girls\\" (1987).<br /><br />Some of the band's best work is on \\"Dr. Feelgood,\\" like the arena-rock anthems \\"Dr. Feelgood,\\" \\"Kickstart My Heart,\\" \\"Same ol' Situation,\\" and \\"Don't Go Away Mad (Just Go Away).\\"  The album's power ballads \\"Without You\\" and \\"Time for Change\\" are far more effective and memorable than many of the ballads from the Crue's peers during that era. Even the \\"filler\\" songs, (\\"Slice of Your Pie,\\" \\"Rattlesnake Shake, \\"Sticky Sweet,\\" \\"She Goes Down\\") between the big singles are effective and keep up the album's momentum. All in all, it's a thoroughly rocking and memorable album.<br /><br />The album does leave a little to be desired. Even if it is Motley Crue, some of the lyrics, especially \\"She Goes Down\\" are pretty dated and cheesy.  And although \\"Dr. Feelgood\\" contains the band's catchiest collection of songs, the album isn't nearly as edgy or dangerous as the classics \\"Too Fast For Love\\" (1981) and \\"Shout at the Devil\\" (1983). Be that as it may, \\"Dr. Feelgood\\" is still one of the best albums from the late `80s pop-metal genre and is sure to please most fans.<br /><br />The bonus material is cool to hear, as it shows the songs in progress. The unreleased track, the mid-tempo \\"Get it for Free\\" sounds like it would have been well suited for the \\"Girls, Girls, Girls\\" album. It's quite cool and should be of interest to most fans.till one of the best albums from the late `80s pop-metal genre and is sure to please most fans.

B008IJT0CE|5|Excellent to listen to at work.
B001H4NXCK|5|This movie is based on the concept of the TV series Maverick from the late 1950s and early 1960s.  It is what I call a playfull western. Instead of being realistic, the film(and the TV series) entertains by showing a charming hero who is the winner in all situations in the show.  Mel Gibson does a fine job of playing the son of the first Maverick, James Garner, who costars in this film. Jodie Foster plays Maverick's love interest- also playing a woman with the same personality as Gibson.  The point of this film is strictly to entertain- and this film does a very good job of this.

B00005JKZV|3|Look, the movie's great, but remember what happened last<BR>year with LotR: FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING!  There was one<BR>release in the summer, with some extras, and a Christmas<BR>release of a deluxe edition with audio commentaries and<BR>other desirable features.<br />Order if you must, but be prepared for a much more<BR>feature-packed DVD to appear in a few months.<BR>If I need to see THE TWO TOWERS before then,<BR>I'll rent.

B00ESB6GBY|3|Its worth watching but I guess it gets all serious in season 9 and not as funny as the other 8 seasons...
B00006JJ1O|5|Ok, at first I had no idea about the kind of music that this group do... but I found curious the name of the band, so I search &amp; listened some songs on the net and that was it... i was totally surprised 'bout the sound that the band has, and of course, the voices of Lena and Julia. The album it's a mix of pop, rock and electronica and the songs are great well produced and well translated as well... and, plus, all the songs talk about young lesbian love between this 2 girls... &quot;Not Gonna Get Us&quot; sounds like a Matrix song, very upbeat and catchy... the highlights are &quot; Show Me Love&quot;, &quot;Clowns&quot;, &quot;30 Minutes&quot;, &quot;All The Things She Said&quot;, and... well, all the tracks in the disc... this CD will introduce you to a whole new dimension in the sound of the russian music... t.A.T.u. is here 2 stay.
B00632HWOG|3|Have a hard time getting on sometimes.  At times, it takes 3 or 4 tries to get on.<br />Some times it is very slow to respond to changing areas.
B002HNA95E|5|This is a fantastic CD collection. Even though I already own all of these songs on other albums, I needed to get this CD for three reasons.<br /><br />1. It's Madonna! And I buy all of her CDs no matter what! She is a GODDESS!<br /><br />2. Who cares if I already own 34 of these songs already? Now I have all of Madonna's Top 10 hits in one place. The track sequence is perfect and the sound quality is phenomenal.<br /><br />3. There are two awesome new songs on here, \\"Celebration\\" and \\"Revolver.\\" Love them, love them, LOVE THEM!<br /><br />One criticism...what happened to \\"4 Minutes\\"?! The editing team butchered that track for some reason. Major bummer! However, I forgive them, because Madonna is Queen. Enough said!
B00149C8BK|5|This is the first and only MJ I have ever purchased.  Trying to compile music from many decades for my wedding reception.  Having graduated from high school in 1983, and finally marrying the boy that stole my heart that same year, our wedding would not be complete without the songs that were the soundtrack to our young lives--but enough of that mushy crap-on to the review.  The sound is amazing, I can't believe what a crisp clean download and a Bose car stereo can do to songs I thought I knew like the back of my hand.  They sound so fantastic, and much more complex than I was ever able to hear in the days when they were new.  Yes, Michael was a total nutjob who ended up looking like the skeleton of a 12 year old girl towards the end, but no one can dispute his musical genius, talent, and timelessness.  I highly recommend this for anyone's collection.  If you are my age (46) or anywhere in that neighborhood, it will bring a flood of memories with each listen.<br />  For an affordable MJ compilation, this is pretty comprehensive at half the price of \\"History\\" -albeit half the songs- and since you wouldn't be buying it if you didn't already like the songs, really the review must be for the overall sound quality, which is excellent.
6300246787|4|For Streisand fans, this is probably her best comedy and singing work next to What's Up Doc w/Ryan O'neil. She plays Dolly Levi a bit &quot;Mae Westish&quot;, but it works beautifully with the rest of the marvelous  supporting cast.  The wide-screen version &lt;if you can find it on TV&gt;  is a bit more enjoyable as the musical numbers tend to fill the screen and  are virtually lost in pan-and-scan. Also, to correct the reviewer who wrote  that Tommy Tune worked for Horace Vandergeller&quot; (Matthau).  He did  NOT. Tune (Ambrose Kemper)played the love interest of Vandergeller's neice,  Ermengarde. The taller of Vandergeller's assistants (Cornelius Hackl) was  played by Michael Crawford, who later became the famous &quot;Phantom of  the Opera&quot; on Broadway.  It's facinating to see how much his voice  improved since 1969.  The CD has been digitally re-mastered and is a joy to  listen to now.  Most consider it the last big-budget musical from  Hollywood... it shows, too!
B003XF1XOQ|4|A powerful ending to a great trilogy. Hard to put down once you pick it up. Would like to thank the author for a wonderful story.

B00I2WNYJW|5|This is the most important book I have ever read. People will be reading this book 100 years from now. If it is still possible for a book to change the world, this is the book that will do it. For years, I have wondered why things are the way they are. Why were my parents able to go to college for almost free, buy property for almost nothing, make do on minimum wage, and get cheap health care, even without insurance, and live on one income  at one job with great benefits, whereas now, even with two incomes and insurance, housing, education and healthcare are so unattainably expensive?  And why is the government broke when I pay so much in taxes? This book goes a long way toward answering these questions by showing how fundamental, structural shifts in population and economic growth, the relationship to earned income versus wealth from capital, taxation, and and the concentration of capital have changed over time, without our even realizing it. The vast structural differences between the 1960s and today happened imperceptibly, but were incredibly important. Piketty makes a persuasive case to take action to make the world a decent place for our children.
B000005IU1|5|Let's not beat around the bush here - this is one great album. It's influence is endless and it still sounds as fresh today as I'm sure it would have over thirty years ago. Songs like \\"1969\\" (later covered by The Damned) and \\"No Fun\\" (later covered by the Sex Pistols) are boundless in their youthful energy and exuberance, while \\"I Wanna be your Dog\\" has a guitar riff that still reverberates in a way that few from this period do. It also has the hallmarks of a classic Velvet Underground rocker (this album being produced by John Cale). The insistent piano chord throughout \\"I Wanna be your Dog\\" is a particular VU trademark. For me, though, the only low point is the slow drag of \\"We Will Fall\\", which seems distinctly out of place amongst the other predominantly three-chord classics. Having said this, you may need a little respite from the constant punishment to your ears of all these pounding power-chords. And its influence? Does anyone remember Punk...? A true undergound classic

B00003RQNJ|5|A story of two Western bankrobbers with contemporary humor and music that gives the story a youthful appeal. How can you not love it? Robert Redford and Paul Newman bring a charm to the film that few of today's actors can muster, and Katharine Ross is both beautiful and likable as the woman who will follow the oulaws anywhere they ask her to go. The film's wry humor, however, is what really has maintained it as a true classic. How could anyone not be charmed by Paul Newman's bicycle stunts?  The sets and costumes are perfectly suited for the era and beautifully recreated.Also, the ending of this film is very well done, the final frame a simple still shot of the two men the audience doesn't want to watch die. This film is a classic that generations will continue to enjoy for many years to come.

6301886143|5|Third time proves lucky in this go-round, which manages to pack in an excellent story similar to Raiders of the Lost Ark, the fun humor of Temple of Doom, and manages to top both in excitement and thrills, as well as being the first Indy film to deliver genuine characterizations.  <br />There are a lot of great setpieces in this installment, making it hard to pick out which is best.  Personally, my favorite is the ten-minute tank chase, which packs in so many dilemmas, it's exhilarating how Steven Spielberg tightly directs this sequence without a hitch.
B00B5186OK|5|What can be said?  In my opinion this album gives us Paavo Berglund's best interpretations of these works.  I ten to judge all others by Berglund anyway so I might be a little partial.  Recommended.
B00GQ7PILC|1|This was absolutely terrible, even the first episode left a bad taste in my mouth. The last episode just left me pissed, I feel the writers intentionally did all that to confuse viewers, I'd hope they'd be smart enough to know what the viewers wanted.....<br /><br />SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS<br />I'm disappointed, this whole season focused on people who inevitably died, Zack and Evelyn. Deb's death was so fast and unexpected, and I felt the whole season Dexter might as well be smoking crack in the bathroom between scenes because his logic and reasoning made NO SENSE at all. For one, why would he think it's a good idea to go to Argentina with Hannah? I thought the Dexter I knew had more sense. And why wouldn't he leave Deb's body to be buried by her friends so they have closure instead of putting her in the ocean with all of those criminals he's killed. And then he rides off into a storm, how dramatic and stupid; as if abandoning his son with a serial killer woman is the best option.

0780021150|5|M both made and broke Lorre's career. It made him into an international success and sent him soaring into the limelight. But it immediately type casted him; leading him into mostly villianous roles. The movie is the first film that shows police procedure. It is also the first to tackle the subject of serial killers. Lorre plays a dejected child killer who just can't \\"help himself\\".  There's a terrific scene of Lorre staring at a young girl through a store window and obviously becoming sexually charged.<br />The idea of the criminals persuing Lorre and holding a kangaroo court is a wee bit silly, but the silliness is made up for the fact that the ending monologue is terrific. Lorre's frustration, self-loathing and desperation is what stands out in the movie. All the other actors don't hold a candle.<br />This is Lang's first venture into sound and of course he does a terrific job of directing; he never shows the murders, but simply implies it. And the part of the cops walking through the streets in complete silence is damn eerie and memorable.<br />My only problem is I wish the DVD had more extras. More about Lorre, more about Lang and more film facts.<br />M should be in every movie lover's collection.<br />*another top notch Lorre film to check out is the hard to find DER VERLORENE, Lorre's first and last directing stint. Very ahead of it's time!

B000FQJAIW|4|Only reason I bought this was for the Original Theatrical Version and I'm content with them. The blurriness during wide shots (particularly in the desert) and grain count of the film don't detract enough to make me like it any less. The sound could be touched up, but hey this is what we got and I'm content until some improved original theatrical version is released.

Initially I was staying away from the movie because I never liked the other boring Sherlock Holmes movies and series. But I finally watched this and i loved it. It was witty and fun all while having great action involved. I'd recommend this to any movie fan who likes action with a little bit of comedy.

0143121421|5|The Spy Who Came In From the Cold was John le Carre's third published novel and the one that thrust him into the literary limelight.  It's told in the third person and features a protagonist named Alec Leamas.  Leamas is a veteran officer in British Intelligence whose recent sojourn as a spy network coordinator has proven to be less than successful.  He agrees to accept one last assignment, a difficult and dangerous one.  If things go according to plan his efforts will result in bringing down East Germany's feared and ruthless spymaster, the loathesome Comrade Mundt.<br /><br />This is a suspenseful, page turner of a book which shows the ambiguous world of espionage in an extremely ugly light.  The actions of the good guys are often as immoral as those of the bad.  A must read for all afficionados of spy novels.  Dark, exciting, exquisitely plotted, groundbreaking.  Very highly recommended.

B00EP22QKG|4|Although I'm still waiting for another &#34;Bad Reputation&#34; album (yes, I know it's time to move forward), we all grow and evolve, and Joan is possibly doing that with this album...while still remaining true to her form delivering rock and roll. This is a decent record  from one the hardest working, best rockers out there.witha few standout tracks  No glossy auto-tuning or over-polishing here (sort of like her &#34;Pure and Simple&#34; album), so it won't knock through all the disposable crap currently on the charts today.  This is probably not the album that will convert non Joan Jett fans into one, and it will probably not win over young ears that don't know Joan.  But if you're a Joan Jett fan, or a fan of her type of music, you will like hearign something new from Joan , but it will not knock you off your seats. Nearly every song hits elements of her prior albums, but this is always a great thing.  Like my title said, this album is not one of my personal favorites and some of the songs (both in regards to the sing-songy tunes or the simple awh-shucks lyrics) seem, well, a bit forced. Again, I'm not knocking the artist....Joan will always be number one in my book and I've enjoyed nearly everything she's put out from her early Runaway days until now (and she friggin' ROCKS in live performances).<br /><br /> &#34;Any Weather&#34; is the clear most commercial-like single.... a fun, pop-py, rock song that has your head bobbing. I didn't love it the first time I heard it (like I did with &#34;I Hate Myself for Loving You&#34;), but it's grown on me. I really enjoy the Blackhearts version (on the Deluxe album) even more than the 606 version. TMI (which has the same sort of rhythm and sound as &#34;Treadin' Water&#34; from &#34;Notorious&#34;), &#34;Bad As We Can Be&#34;, &#34;Reality Mentality&#34; and &#34;Make it Back&#34; are fun, bouncy, rock out tracks as well.<br /><br />&#34;Different&#34; is a rock-anthem to all those out there who want to do their own thing but are constantly being told &#34;they're different&#34; .....another great with a chant shout-response refrain going on inside the tune (&#34;Live you life outside the box, focus on the things you're not&#34;....). This is one of my favorite tunes with her typical life-affirming message!!!!  ;-)  I also love the cowbell-heartbeat thump throughout the song and closing it out. She also includes a shortened stripped down version of this song on the deluxe album, which I really like as much as the studio version....I wish she did the stripped down version as full length instead of cutting it off at a minute and a half....it's a shame...she sounds great on that track.<br /><br />&#34;I Know What I Know&#34; is a fun tune which has a great message about being confident with yourself, with some kick-ass guitar work throughout, and it's made even better by the clever repeating/blending/overlapping of &#34;I Know&#34; at the end.......very reminiscent of the way &#34;Eye to Eye&#34; ends on her album &#34;Pure and Simple&#34;.  &#34;Fragile&#34; is my second favorite cut with with a haunting tune throughout the repetitive &#34;...love/life/hearts is/are so fragile&#34;, and I absolutely love the way she holds and sings &#34;fragile&#34; at a rising pitch at the end.  &#34;Seriously&#34; is a mostly shouted punk &#34;song&#34;(it should have been more singing).......sort of reminds me of her better cover of the Sex Pistols &#34;EMI&#34; (which she renamed MCA), or Blondie's &#34;Rip Her to Shreds&#34;.  Although some people seem to be on the fence with the ballad &#34;Everybody Needs a Hero&#34;, I sorta like it....her voice is sort of pitchy here, but it adds a interesting haunting sound to it.....it reminds me of a better version of her &#34;I Got No Answers&#34; ballad from the album &#34;Glorious Results&#34;.<br /><br />I would have liked to have seen a few more &#34;tighter&#34; songs (both lyrically and musically) like Spinster, Eye To Eye, Hate Myself For Loving You, Little Liar, Activity Girl, Bad Time, Five, Cherry Bomb, Get off the Cross, You Don't Know What You Got etc., but all in all, I'm enjoying this album and I'll be listening to it for months to come. And each time I listen to it, I do get a bit more into it.<br /><br />Nothing really bad here from Joan, but my two personal least favorite cuts: the sort of sing-songy  &#34;Hard to Grow Up&#34; (which sort of reminds me of &#34;Frustrated&#34; and &#34;Hold Me&#34; from &#34;Glorious Results&#34;) and the somewhat forced &#34;Soulmates to Strangers&#34; (which isn't bad.....I'm just not a huge fan relative to the other tracks, though most others seem to really like this track a lot). And I do find myself humming it once in awhile, so there you go.me, Five, Cherry Bomb, Get off the Cross, You Don't Know What You Got etc., but all in all, I'm enjoying this album and I'll be listening to it for months to come.

B00W3V83QW|5|A great game
B00164DWEA|5|*WARNING: SPOILERS BELOW IN RECAP*    RECAP:  The best of the Marvel movies this summer was released yesterday. I do not read superhero comic books, but I do see almost every superhero movie. This film is at the top of my list. The beginning opens up with action right away. After Ang Lee's 2003 release, Hulk (which I personally loved), Ed Norton didn't waste anytime with an origin story. The opening credits, lasting about 1 1/2 minutes to 2 minutes, recap Bruce Banner's experiment with gamma radiation, which turns him into the Hulk. The next thing we see is Bruce 5 months later hiding out in Brazil from Gen. Ross, since he is now a fugitive. He is learning Portuguese, working in a bottle factory, and trying to control his breathing to stop what is referred as the incident. Gen. Ross finds him eventually, the cause including a cameo from Stan Lee (possibly his best). Now Bruce is on his way home in order to find Mr. Blue (Dr. Samuel Sterns played by Tim Blake Nelson) in order to find a cure. He first runs into Betty Ross (Liv Tyler), his love, and she helps him hide from her father, Gen. Ross. Gen. Ross has a Russian soldier on his team, Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth) who witnesses Banner's transformation and is more than glad to go through a similar exposure of gamma radiation to achieve that strength and power. This leads to the villain Abomination. Finally, at the end Bruce must turn and fight Abomination in order to save New York City in a nicely done concluding battle.    OPINION:  As I stated above, this is my favorite Marvel film of the summer, considering there are only two out. I personally hated Iron Man. I will get that out of the way first. I thought the beginning was excellent and should have continued on that way. But once the film goes back 36 hours to recap Tony Stark's history and how he got in that particular situation of being held captive, the momentum is totally thrown out of balance. I do not like it when films spoon feed you either, I wanted a film that slowly and progressively told you the history of Tony Stark. Dr. Yinsen should have slowly and gradually learned about Tony Stark through stories from Tony and how he got there, instead of in a boring and linear fashion. I think Jon Favreau made the terrorists out to look very stupid, which they aren't. First, Tony Stark is not building their missile and they know that, but they let him continue building his soon to be iron man suit (the first product). The acting was ok, with funny one liners thrown at you from all directions, but it was very simplistic and there was nothing to the story. Tony Stark spends so much time testing out his new and final iron man suit, more time than him actually fighting in it. Also, the very end when Obadiah jumps into his version of iron man, he knows how to fly it and work it and everything, whereas Tony Stark had to spend forever testing his suit out. I also didn't like how the villain was basically iron man himself, just an older version. Overall I thought the movie was too boring, too simplistic, with too many one liners and not enough depth.    The Incredible Hulk on the other hand begins with a bang. I think Ed Norton was the perfect choice to play Bruce Banner and kudos to him for making the film work with his modified version of the screenplay (unfortunately he does not get any credit for it). This is my favorite superhero movie of the year and my second overall movie of the year behind Speed Racer and Wall-e is a follow-up to this film.  As I mentioned up top, I do love Ang Lee's version, Hulk, because of the phsycological look on Bruce Banner and his past and the trauma he went through as a child. For me this film continues right where Ang Lee's left off. At the end of Hulk Bruce Banner is in the Brazilian forest, where Ed Norton's Banner is seen at the start of this film. In Hulk Banner brings up, at one point, to his father (Nick Nolte) that he will find a cure and get rid of this thing inside of him. Before he can do that he must go through the phsycological stuff first. Once the film ends he has been through it and now must deal with finding a cure. That is where The Incredible Hulk begins. I didn't mind the CGI in Ang Lee's version, but after seeing this years, it is quite obvious that this CGI is much better. So Ed Norton did a great job playing Bruce, better than Eric Bana. Liv Tyler was really good as Betty Ross (although I love Jennifer Connely), William Hurt did a wonderful job as Gen. Ross, and Tim Roth was great as the crazy (although not nearly as crazy as Nick Nolte) Emil Blonsky. The fighting sequences were very fun and well done, Norton and Tyler had great chemistry, Tim Blake Nelson was great, Roth was very convincing, and overall I loved this film and see it as a great SEQUEL to the original Hulk movie, even though Norton refers to it as a reboot (and a lot do, since that is what it truly is) and there are a few things that may not necessarily fall in line with the original story line. The film has great cameos.
7119005901|5|I ordered this set, and unlike a previous reader, it was not bilingual, but all in English.  <br />One great thing about this set is the notes in the back of the book.  It explains mysterious quotes, historical figures, and also symbolistic characters that contribute to the development of the Three Kingdoms.<br />One question, for you all:  In the notes section, it usually comments on &quot;TS.&quot;  For example, &quot;In TS (pg 71), Zhao ZiLong said, ....&quot;  What does the TS stand for? I understand it is a book that they are reffering to, but what is the official title and who wrote it?

B001ED7C58|5|I love this soundtrack!! Especially the song Eyes On Fire by Blue Foundation. I think that song could not of been more perfect for this Movie. I listen to this CD everyday. Robert Pattinson's song is also great!!! I think they did a wonderful job in making this Soundtrack!!!
B00688628M|5|Band of Brothers helps us to understand some of the horror of war and the reason for very real, close, brother relationship developed by very different  men who have gone thru terrible fights and the very real shacow of death togerher.  Only they can understand each others experiences but a little light on this helps us not say the wrong thing sometimes by realizing the day after day barrage of trauma these men have endured. It also makes us realize that without each other they would probably not have made it.
B00B0X4PIO|3|As always, very well written. The poetic touch is present throughout and Mr. Hosseini sure knows how to weave a whole host of interesting stories together. Though in this case there were too many shorter stories running throughout, which caused a bit of distraction in the main storyline.<br /><br />The two main characters of the story tend to get sidelined for a major portion of the book, and while the other intertwined stories are fairly emotional in their own right, some of them end up remaining disjointed even till the very end - something which was not the case in The Kite Runner and A Thousand Splendid Suns...
1250038820|5|Love the book!! Very well done.  Great pics and stories.  I will forward it to my children, when I'm done with it.

B000001OAA|5|I still haven't heard their second cd, but judging by this masterpiece, it should be fantastic. Most mainstream alternative bands have a male lead singer (except Hole, of course) and judging by the examples, rock would be  much more interesting if that was not so. Being a feminist, I like how  Manson's voice is angry, and powerful, not to mention wonderful sounding,  something you don't hear alot of in music today. Each and every song is  great! Personally, my favorite lyric is &quot;You thought I was a little  girl/you thought I was a little mouse/ You thought you'd take me by  suprise/ Now I'm here burning down your house&quot; Actually from one of my  favorite songs, &quot;Not My Idea&quot;

B0034EEE2E|3|I wanted to like this but literally every track has the same musical treatment.  Even some of the melodies are bit too similar to each other.  The tracks could use another layer of really anything (guitar or violin perhaps?) to make these tracks work better.  The vocals have an echo component to them, which is fine, but it is used on every track. There are subtle components to the tracks, especially with the vocals and electronic drums but it isnt enough to sustain _all_ of these tracks.  Sorry but I just couldnt get my head around how similar all of the tracks are to each other.

B00C8S9VKM|5|Bill Bryson doesn't disappoint. This is a most interesting and comprehensive history of a pivotal summer in US history. I especially enjoy the books that Bryson reads and find myself dipping into them at odd moments for the pure joy of his humor.
B007J4T2G8|5|i absolutley LOVED this book. it was my first exotic novel and the author had me the whole way. happy, excited, sad, aroused.
B00J5A1MEY|3|This movie is a fine bit of fluff to scratch your Hunger Games/Harry Potter itch.  The acting is so-so, but the production values are pretty good and it's not a bad way to spend an evening in.  I don't have kids, but I would put the age-appropriateness around 12.  There is some violence, but nothing super gory.
B002WIDRM6|5|Excellent delivery and the music is great. I sure like the ability to sownload my purchases in MP3 format so I can play on a flashdrive in my car.
1592537251|5|I had no idea that such an organization for artists existed.  Really good, creative work from all over the world.
B00009TB5G|5|I was just commenting on an earlier comment made about information within the DVD.  I was reading reviews (not like i really needed to because i know it's going to be great) but someone made mention of C.S. Lewis' aethism and how this person knew that to be false.<br />  For correction, C.S. Lewis was an aethist.  I have done some research on Lewis, and if this person would have read something by Lewis or done even a little research, he would have realized that Lewis was an aethist during his lifetime.  However, the person isn't totally wrong about Lewis's aethism.  C.S. did convert to Christiainity.  I just thought I would provide this information, and J.R.R. Tolkien and Lewis did a lot of Christian Fiction together,<br />  Enjoy the DVD!!!!!

B000002UAX|5|Of all the years that may have been the turning point of the 1960s, 1968 was one of the most pivotal years in terms of politics, culture, and most of all music.  Out of this year came one of the most eclectic albums to be released, The Beatles' White Album.  This record defines what direction rock and roll was heading, and who better to lead the transition from AM pop to FM album oriented rock than the band who changed the face of rock and roll just four years earlier in 1964?<br /><br />After a short respite with Magical Mystery Tour and Yellow Submarine, the band regrouped to follow-up their monumental Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Heart's Club Band album with The Beatles. The sound is distinguishable on the White Album, and clearly shows each member of the band as individuals.  The ironic thing about the record is how it is fragmented as opposed to the strong cohesion that existed on Pepper.  However, the record stands out in terms of the maturation of the songwriting and musicianship.  This is exemplified with George Harrison's exceptional \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps \\" and a Moody Blues sounding \\"Long, Long, Long\\"  (the piano chords sound like \\"Go Now\\").  Nonetheless, George shines on this record as well as Ringo with \\"Don't Pass Me By\\" and \\"Goodnight.\\"  Indeed, the songwriting team of Lennon and McCartney has ventured on their own, but seeds of \\"solo career\\" sprout from the songs that each present.<br /><br />The songs that John and Paul present on the White Album bear reflections of their time with the Maharishi as well as their somewhat creative competitiveness. The White Album is the most profound and raunchiest work they have ever done.  The highlights of the album range from the pumping bass line in \\"Everybody's Got Something To Hide Except For Me and My Monkey,\\" The Who-influenced \\"Helter Skelter,\\" the storytelling \\"Rocky Raccoon\\" and \\"The Continuous Story of Bungalow Bill,\\" the blues-driven \\"Yer Blues\\" (Cream or Led Zeppelin-like rock) and \\"Why Don't We Do It In The Road\\" to the sentimental \\"I Will\\" and \\"Julia.\\"  However, John tops the record with the haunting, apocalyptic, experimental, and sublime \\"Revolution 9\\" (as a 12 year old, hearing this particular track with the headphones on and listening to the opening repetition of \\"number nine, number nine\\" and the dissonant tones from a piano playing in the background gave chills and a nightmarish feel down my spine).<br /><br />Overall, this is the Beatles.  The White Album has just about everything on it for any rock and roll listener.  This is the record where many bands after the Beatles have taken a guitar chord or melody and made it their own to give it that Beatles sound.  You have not heard the sound and feel of the late sixties until you've heard this album.It In The Road\\" to the sentimental \\"I Will\\" and \\"Julia.\\"  However, John tops the record with the haunting, apocalyptic, experimental, and sublime \\"Revolution 9\\" (as a 12 year old, hearing this particular track with the headphones on and listening to the opening repetition of \\"number nine, number nine\\" and the dissonant tones from a piano playing in the background gave chills and a nightmarish feel down my spine).  <br /> <br />Overall, this is the Beatles.

B00DJFIMW6|5|this is the best game by far. I love the minions and the sound effects make me laugh. great job on this one. I have it on my kindle fire.
B0091W6QZG|5|Really great movie
B001ECQ6PG|4|Nice little portable so far.  I have had issues with slightly warped records rubbing on the support pads unevenly as the record turns, and this results in slight pitch and speed issues.  But this is a portable and not really meant for serious use, so I can't complain too much.    The thing is pretty light weight, and worked out of the box.  Definitely happy with it so far.
B000053VAZ|5|This is one of my favorite moview for the human interest, the delicate handling of a difficult reality for many people...the humor and the performances. I have used the poker game scene to inspire \\"yardsale poker\\" were we all bet with used possessions and it was a BLAST. I never won or bet a cousin....yet. :)
B0095MVOMC|5|its a fun and relaxen game..it does kinda fire u up when u cant find last number. its cheap enough
B00B9B4IYI|3|I love the Bluetooth functionality that this adds to my Yamaha AVR, but this receiver seems to be a little buggy.  I've found that after making an initial connection with my phone, it will work fine, but if I turn off Bluetooth on my phone and try to reconnect later, I can't--I've been having to disconnect the receiver from it's power supply before I can connect my phone to it again.  I will likely be returning this item and purchasing a replacement--there appears to be better options at a cheaper price as well.
B000ELJBAK|5|I rediscovered this CD.  I had the original vinyl album when it came out in 1978.  I wasn't impressed with it then.  I then happened to catch one of the tracks on Pandora and picked up this remastered edition.  Wow - I was blown away.  So much there that I never heard before.  I can't recommend this cd highly enough.  Pick this one up.  You. Will. Not. Be. Disappointed.
B000002H72|5|the pixies are my all time favorite band, and out of their albums, this is the greatest.  if you have never heard them before, start here.  you won't regret it.  although my fave song isn't on here (isla de encanta), debaser, broken face, and, of course, gigantic are all songs worthy of listening to repeatedly.  so, check out the pixies.  they rock.

6305342776|4|In the 70s, Disney made wonderfully adult movies such as this and &quot;The Watcher in the Woods&quot;, with violence, suspense, and many other things not suitable for young children.  Then, suddenly, they  stopped, instead cranking out the same animated musical with different  titles.  Let's hope they go back to making movies like this.  I mean, what  other Disney movie features people BURNING IN HELL?!  Now, THAT's not your  usual Disney!
B007SYWFRM|5|this game is so fun it will keep you busy for hours and hours to come. It is convienient because you don't need wi fi and is my favorite game
B00DA6YEKS|5|I absolutely love how unique this story is from other science fiction books. He developed an amazing world unlike anything else I've ever seen. I've always loved Brandon Sanderson's array of characters in his novels and this one does not disappoint!

B00992CF6W|5|I love Minecraft so much! Fours hours of Minecraft feels like thirty minutes! I am really not that into building stuff in real life, but I like creative mode. I like survival too when I am in a daring mood. #LOL The only problem I have with this game is that there are so many glitches on multiplayer. I play with my sisters probably more than I play by myself. They might as well call it glitchcraft. That is the only problem though and it isn't that bad. Once you get used to it, you will be a true minecrafter! I recommend this game to anyone who is very busy and on their free time, they just want to sit down and relax! ;)
B00CL68QVQ|5|This is definitely a must see.  I have watched it many times. the cast is so amazing.
B00AREIAI8|4|This is a good app for my tablet. It bogged down my phone though. Overall, very enjoyable. The graphics are very good, and it serves as a nice diversion.
B002QE3CTY|5|This book grabbed you from the beginning and never let go until the last page.  Worth reading. Similar to the Hunger Games
B000SEKNUK|5|Thanks for this book ! It really changes my life. Indeed, when I want to find something as a new door to open my mind and to resolve my difficulties in balancing between social life and professional career, The Art of Possibility is shining that door. I used to read a lot of how-to books, but, in fact it is hard to follow and some of them just taught me how to do, not changed my mind and my way of thinking. Through wonderful short stories from authors, I experience great steps in my thinking about this world. Knowing and learning how to do something are easy, but feeling, trusting and acknowledging to follow something are really arduous. This book transforms me in the second way.
0316666343|3|I really enjoyed reading this but had a hard time toward the end.  I am usually a reader of suspense/mystery novels.  I enjoyed the way it was written and the creativity of the story. <br />Worth reading!
0099664313|5|Diana Gabaldon is in top form. Her books grab your heart and imagination from the start and never lets go. There is so much packed into the stories that you keep reading to find out what happens next. Then when you make it to the end you can start over and learn some great historic tidbits.

B000BJ7BCK|4|A Dizzy movie I liked that sort of combines the high school cliques<br />type movie with comic book superheros.<br />We have an aging Superman type married to a Wonderwoman type and they have a kid who hasn't yet found his way.<br />The older social diva finds a way into the kid's life edging out his real friends?<br />If anyone tells you that your friends aren't your friends anymore,<br />watch out!
B005O7PXNS|5|Well written, acted, cast, and a joy to watch.  One of the best seasons to date...the finale is one of the best hours of television you will see anymore.
B003VANOFY|1|I purchase this headset a few months ago and after two months of use, I noticed a crack in the plastic area where there are screws at, which eventually broke into pieces.  Logitech did give me a replacement and after another two months of use, the exact same problem on the other side.  It seems the plastic they used was cheap Chinese plastic that is not durable at all.  The sound quality is great and the voice boom mic works great as well.  If only it was durable and made to last.  I can't understand why the reviewers gave it good reviews, apparently they didn't use it long enough...
B00003CX8Y|3|I was happy to receive this.  BUT it was open and definitely was a copy....I will keep it, however, I do not support piracy.<br />The movie is such a great one- a real classic.

B0099Y2MYK|5|WHAT MORE CAN ONE ADD TO ALL THE DESERVING ACCOLADES HEAPED UPON DOWNTON ABBEY. IT IS INTELLIGENT AND ENTERTAINING. EACH ACTOR SEEMS PERFECTLY SUITED FOR THEIR RESPECTIVE ROLES. MAGGIE SMITH IS SUCH FUN TO WATCH. STORY-LINES AND PLOTS ARE FIRST RATE.<br /><br />BECAUSE I BOUGHT MY 1,2,3 SERIES FROM AMAZON.CO.UK, I HAVE THE SEASON FINALE PURCHASED AS A SEPARATE DVD. (THEY ARE GIVING THE FINALE FREE AS A PART OF SERIES 3 HERE IN NORTH AMERICA.) ALONG WITH U.K. SERIES 3, THEY SENT FOR FREE, THE DOWNTON ABBEY 2013 DAILY DIARY WITH EACH PAGE CONTAINING A LARGE GLOSSY PHOTO OF THE VARIOUS CHARACTERS AND/OR SCENES FROM THE SERIES. I DON'T KNOW IF THEY ARE GIVING THE DIARY FREE HERE IN N.A.<br /><br />I HAVE VIEWED EACH SERIES 4-5 TIMES AS I AM SURE MANY PEOPLE HAVE ALSO. THIS PRODUCTION IS SO RICH WITH INFORMATION ABOUT THE TIMES, CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT, CLOTHING, DECOR & FURNISHINGS, AS WELL AS THE MIND SETS OF THE DAY, ETC. DOWNTON WILL GO DOWN IN HISTORY AS ONE OF THE TOP TELEVISION SHOWS EVER.<br /><br />I BOUGHT THE WONDERFUL KEEPSAKE BOOK, \\"DOWNTON ABBEY CHRONICLES\\". WRITTEN BY JESSICA FELLOWES, AND THE PAPERBACK \\"Lady Almina and the Real Downton Abbey: The Lost Legacy of Highclere Castle [Paperback]\\" BOTH ARE AVAILABLE HERE ON AMAZON.COM. LADY ALMINA'S STORY ITSELF IS UNUSUAL AND VERY INTERESTING.<br /><br />SERIES 3 ENDS WITH SUCH A CLIFF HANGER THAT LEFT ME STUNNED. WE CAN'T WAIT UNTIL SERIES 4. AND THAT'S THE IDEA EH?

B000060P79|4|These guys, along with bands like new found glory, and the starting line and good charlotte are getting blasted for being too pop and not enough punk.  liking music is all about just giving it a chance and people who diss these guys simply aren't giving them a chance.  My advice is; open your mind and quit living in the past, ditch your NOFX and Sex Pistols albums and grab this one.
B00GSQJJ34|4|It's a pretty fun minecraft inspired racing game. Personally I'm not a fan of in app purchases especially for a game that isn't free. My son likes it, but I wish we could build a track.
B008966SLM|5|I absolutely love this cd. The songs are what I call &#34;feel good music&#34;.  I just feel good when I listen to them. Robert Cray and the band have out done themselves for sure on this one.

B007Y2W44W|5|After a 10 year layoff from buying new Nile material (I own the 3 98-02 releases) I decided to give Nile another try.  While I like Nile, I didn't like them enough to keep buying every new album they released.  So, after a 10 year gap I can hear some big improvements from Nile on At The Gate of Sethu.  The new vocalist is the best the band has had and actually sings the words it sounds like instead of the groan/growl/grrrr of early releases.  The song structure seems similar to all Nile releases a mix of slow and fast death metal with some really nice lead guitar work and drumming.  I really like the cleaner more modern production, the instruments come through with more power even if Nile loses some of there former muddy/heavy sound.  Maybe some of the old Nile fans won't be a huge fan of the new work, but maybe it will gain them some new fans turned away by that old style.
B00M4ADWQ8|5|Jolie killed it. She brought Maleficent to life. Hard core fairy-tale princess devotees might have difficulty with it but I loved how this story was rendered. Loved it. Loved the special effects, the characters, the casting, the story line and its flow. I'm only sorry I don't hear more about it and was disappointed that the special features segment of the DVD was so anemic. I wanted to know more about the production and Jolie's artistry. I would not recommend it for younger ones in fact I would venture to say that we older folks brought up on the original Disney version could potentially enjoy this production with a special appreciation.  It is too intense for younger audiences, however, kudos to Jolie for her delivery (she brought it) and an impressive production. Oh yes Amazon was terrific about getting it to me as well.
0316069485|4|I always look forward to spending tine with Harry Bosch.  I also enjoy Mickey Haller.  Somehow when put together when they have to share center stage it is not as satisfying.  The story has some very clever techniques.  I particularly enjoyed the two voices alternating and at times I had to think about who was talking.  Also the trial strategy portion was excellent.  The problem was that the book basically lacked suspense.  I had written previously that a second rate Connelly beats most other best efforts but we can still hope for a first rate effort.
B00PYXHY20|3|I like Steve Earl but have other CD's of his that I like better.
B00CO4GO7I|5|American Sniper was one of the best books I have ever read.  Chris Kyle was truly an  American Hero.
B00FY3O0X6|5|I reviewed this album many, many years ago considering that it was a favorite at the time, and still is as of this writing. I wanted to return here and review the expanded deluxe edition of my favorite U2 album &#34;Unforgettable Fire&#34;. Originally released in late 1984, it marked a profound change in style from the austerity of &#34;War&#34; towards a mix of atmospheric ethereal sounds, thanks in part to the collaboration with Daniel Lanois and Brian Eno, both of whom have produced marvelous works of art, both solo and with others.<br /><br /> This particular edition that I'm reviewing not only remasters the original release but also included 16 extra tracks, some of them live recordings from the tour that promoted this album, and also a huge stash of B-sides and slightly altered versions of the original songs that made it on the regular album. Even better is the inclusion of B-Sides that didn't even make it on the much beloved &#34;Best of/B-Sides 1980-1998&#34; collection and some of the songs that actually were on that collection, appear on here, in slightly altered versions, some of which I'd say are actually the 'true' versions.<br /><br /> The original album is in remastered form. For those familiar with the original album, there’s little need to explain much other than to say that it is a marvelous blend of rock, atmospheric etherealism, and beautiful songwriting and an atmospheric sound that in my opinion, nobody else, not even U2 themselves ever came close to recapturing again, until Lanterna’s “Desert Ocean” album 22 years later but that’s for a whole separate review. My favorite tracks are the four-track bundle starting the title track with its serious atmosphere of beautiful keyboard arrangements, excellent drumbeats, and overall dark but blissful atmosphere. Following that is the eerily beautiful track “Promenade” with Bono’s vocals amidst a very subdued background melody. Following that is the haunting instrumental “4th of July” with a haunting sound that conjures the feel of watching the fireworks from a very great distance away. And who can forget the ever-enduring classic “Bad” with its marvelous songwriting, craftsmanship, and atmospheric texture.<br /><br /> It is however the second disc containing B-Sides, rarities, and remixes that highlight this review. Most of these songs are a mix of experimental noodlings, and tracks that would definitely sound out of place on the regular album but nevertheless have their own merit in the B-Side world.<br /><br /> Starting at track one, is a live performance of the opening track &#34;A Sort of Homecoming&#34;. A real treat is the a live version of their famous classic &#34;Bad&#34; which is one of my favorite songs on the parent album. If you loved the studio album version, this live performance does the album version proud and has a unique of it's own. The live version's climax gives way to a winding down phase and gradually fades down and comes to a beautiful conclusion. The next track &#34;Love Comes Tumbling&#34; is a B-Side that appeared on the &#34;Best of 1980-1998/B-sides&#34; compilation albeit in slightly edited form. The song has a very unusual sound with an obtuse sound that feels more like something from Roxy Music's &#34;Avalon&#34; or a mid to late 1980s Bryan Ferry recording. Especially with the drum loop. The guitar textures are very unusual and have the feel of a mix of spirits, and even angels actually performing with the band. Even Bono's vocals have the feel of echoing from a great distance. It feels very different from other songs that U2 did during this period and it is one of my favorite U2 B-sides from this era. The song was actually done in a few different versions. The version on here is almost identical to the one found on the &#34;Best of&#34; compilation but has a longer instrumental intro before the vocals start. The next song “Three Sunrises” is a very strange bird of a track in the sense of beginning withan ambient intro but then when the full song goes into full gear, it suddenly shifts in actual tuning and almost adopts a whole different pitch altogether. This kind of playing with musical tunings is very, very rare in pop music and those with perfect pitch or have a strong recognition of musical notes will notice this really odd trick. Overall, the song is a really great song. Even better is before ending, it changes back to the ‘normal’ tuning in the closing seconds almost like going through dimensions before emerging back into ‘this one’. This version is the same as found on the “Best of 1980-1990” collection. &#34;Yoshida Blossom&#34; is a B-Side that didn't appear on the compilation but finally makes its presence. Probably among the closest to feeling like the &#34;War&#34; era, this song begins with a discordant guitar intro and blends into a heavy keyboard intro before becoming a fast-paced instrumental, very much a cross between the feel and mood of &#34;New Year's Day&#34; with the rhythm patterns of &#34;Wire&#34; and utilizing the best of both songs. The shrieking guitar effects in many respects replace lyrics and conjure up the pain and terror that befell many survivors of the atomic bombings in Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945. I can easily imagine the agonized faces when listening to the guitar effects. Mentioning that, an extended version of “Wire” follows “Yoshida” with a very different intro and different rhythm patterns before shifting instantly into the version heard on the parent album. The vocals feel much more echoing. Next up is an extended version of “Pride” Who can forget Bono singing about the scars of Memphis 1968 on that great classic? Because it was what put the parent album on the map, it is noteworthy because appears on here in an extended form with an extra vocal passage with Bono's famous &#34;In The Name of Love!&#34; lyric sung in extended form starting at 3:02 and in a much greater intensity. Overall, with this extra power, this already great song is made into an even better enduring classic. The next track is a reworking of the opening track &#34;A Sort of Homecoming&#34; with a very different reworking including a mix of acoustic passages in place of the original rock guitar sounds that dominate the original song. Even the pitch tuning sounds different giving this version a feel that is very different from the original yet maintaining the spirit at the same time. For some odd reason, the song &#34;11 O'clock Tick Tock&#34; finds its way here in extended form. Originally recorded and released before even their debut album &#34;Boy&#34;, it has an unusual blend of wintery atmospherics and late 1970s/early 1980s New Wave. For those who have been critical of the band or record labels' decision not to include this on the 'Best of' collection, you’re requests have now been answered. This song for many seemed to drift in the netherworld of 'bootlegs' or 'EPs' and there are two other versions out there but at least one of them is now available on the deluxe edition of &#34;Unforgettable Fire&#34;. A second version of “Wire” called the ‘Celtic Dub’ mix makes its appearance. Despite the title, I don’t hear anything ‘celtic’ in this version but the textures feel slightly altered from the original parent album version. A great song in slightly different form nonetheless. My favorite track on here is the atmospheric instrumental &#34;Bass Trap&#34;. If there was ever a song that I felt captured a bit of heaven, this might be it for me. The song is a very quiet, moody instrumental with the guitars played with a heavy ethereal backdrop comprised of atmospheric keyboard arrangements and bluesy sounds. I often picture a mix of office buildings amidst a mostly cloudy evening sky during the spring, summer, and autumn and the mix of urban street lights and office window lights providing contrast with the blue evening skies. It is mostly repetitive with some slight variations but it is meant to be like a heavenly journey through the modern world. This version on here is much longer than the version found on the “Best of/B-Sides” with some added passages. I overall find this version on here to feel more ‘complete’. The haunting instrumental &#34;4th of July&#34; makes it's second appearance in a slightly longer form. It feels very much like the parent album version but with some tweaked sounds. Finally there is &#34;Sixty Seconds in Kingdom Come&#34; which is a great closer to this set of B-Sides. It has a very strong bass guitar as a backdrop and it provides the song a lot of punch as it develops some background vocals and U2's early 80s trademark guitar sound in the background. I get the impression that if the song &#34;Bad&#34; was recorded at the same time as the songs from the &#34;War&#34; era, it would've sounded a lot like this.<br /><br /> As a long-time fan of U2 over many years, I've come to appreciate all of their albums starting with &#34;Boy&#34; and even all the way up through their &#34;Songs of Innocence&#34; and enjoy all of them to varying degrees. Yes, the following two albums &#34;Joshua Tree&#34; and &#34;Achtung Baby&#34; are far more famous, deservedly so, and sold countless millions, but to me, “The Unforgettable Fire” remains among my favorites, if not my actual favorite U2 record in their entire career. Having said that, it is a real delight that this marvelous album not only saw much-needed remastering but also a second CD with a huge treasure chest of B-Sides and some different versions of the original tracks, especially since some of these lost treasures were never available anywhere except maybe on rare bootlegs or long out-of-print vinyl released. Now they are given a new lease on life on the deluxe 2-CD version of this magnificent album. If there are yet more songs that still didn’t make it on here, I’m not aware of them but even so, this deluxe edition of “Unforgettable Fire” is one of the best ways to re-release an album in remastered form: The original version in remastered form, and a second disc of B-sides, and remixes of the original songs.<br /><br /> Unless you are a casual fan of U2’s music, if you just buy the one-CD version remastered, you are likely to miss out on a huge treasure chest of hidden gems. Highly recommended.this extra power, this already great song is made into an even better enduring classic. The next track is a reworking of the opening track &#34;A Sort of Homecoming&#34; with a very different reworking including a mix of acoustic passages in place of the original rock guitar sounds that dominate the original song.

Finally there is &#34;Sixty Seconds in Kingdom Come&#34; which is a great closer to this set of B-Sides. It has a very strong bass guitar as a backdrop and it provides the song a lot of punch as it develops some background vocals and U2's early 80s trademark guitar sound in the background. I get the impression that if the song &#34;Bad&#34; was recorded at the same time as the songs from the &#34;War&#34; era, it would've sounded a lot like this.<br /><br /> As a long-time fan of U2 over many years, I've come to appreciate all of their albums starting with &#34;Boy&#34; and even all the way up through their &#34;Songs of Innocence&#34; and enjoy all of them to varying degrees. Yes, the following two albums &#34;Joshua Tree&#34; and &#34;Achtung Baby&#34; are far more famous, deservedly so, and sold countless millions, but to me, “The Unforgettable Fire” remains among my favorites, if not my actual favorite U2 record in their entire career. Having said that, it is a real delight that this marvelous album not only saw much-needed remastering but also a second CD with a huge treasure chest of B-Sides and some different versions of the original tracks, especially since some of these lost treasures were never available anywhere except maybe on rare bootlegs or long out-of-print vinyl released. Now they are given a new lease on life on the deluxe 2-CD version of this magnificent album. If there are yet more songs that still didn’t make it on here, I’m not aware of them but even so, this deluxe edition of “Unforgettable Fire” isone of the best ways to re-release an album in remastered form: The original version in remastered form, and a second disc of B-sides, and remixes of the original songs.<br /><br /> Unless you are a casual fan of U2’s music, if you just buy the one-CD version remastered, you are likely to miss out on a huge treasure chest of hidden gems. Highly recommended.
B0061PEAUY|5|As usual, Kathy Reichs keeps you guessing.  She holds your attention, and this was a fast read - hard to put down.  I highly recommend this to her readers.
B000001EQT|5|My friend Marc and I used to take trips to the old coastal bunkers all around the San Francisco Bay Area to map them out.  The first thing we would do when hopping into the car was stick The Slider in the 8 track.  Now admittedly, the lyrics were nonsensical and silly, but the sound was so catchy, that in no time we'd be singing along with them.  The sound was just so unique and riveting, that we'd listen over and over.  Point is, this album will give bring back memories if you grew up in that era, and will give you an idea of what it was really like growing up in the 70's.
B00EOARZ4G|3|This book is long on story short on action and interesting dialogue. It seemed like I was reading just another Tom Clancy story about the Cold War.
B00S8HXDKQ|4|Cute little Free App Of the Day on Amazon, puzzle like, and got more challenging as the levels went on.  Easy to catch onto.  Just plug the balls into the turning/spinning circle without hitting another attached ball.<br /><br />Highly addictive, and it gets harder QUICK.  At least it didn't have any annoying adware or anything attached too it.  Nice .99 cent game.<br /><br />Like anything else, once you get frustrated, you leave it, but always come back to it.<br /><br />4 star for me
B00F2362IE|5|My 4 and 6 year olds both love playing this game!
B00BAXFJ5M|5|I thoroughly enjoyed this novel from beginning to end. The plot was creative and made this read hard to put down. I am looking forward to Baldacci's next one.
B00I3ULVLQ|5|I received the case quickly and was happy with the way it fit.  It's not as bulky as other covers but still provides protection.
B00JOT3HQ2|5|This game is amazing.When I heard about I thought it would be terrible.but it was good.when I played it.
B000002TQV|5|I think it says this will be review #422, but I have to add my praise to this mountain of love.   <br /> <br />People always write about this album as the turning point where you can see that Radiohead is about to get good, as though their catalog really starts with OK Computer.  To me, this is the best album Radiohead has put out.   <br />  <br />Kid A/HTTT Radiohead is great, but I think there are millions of us silent, hidden, Radiohead fans who would prefer a great rock song like \\"High and Dry\\" to a brilliant electronica experiment with a cat meowing intermitently.  <br /> <br />I know that they returned to some guitars in their last album, and I'm not knocking the newer stuff, but really, this album-to me and the average smart music listener-is the top of Radiohead's great heap.
B00FGWTOBI|5|Love it! I bought it for a birthday present. The girl loved it. She makes me play it every day. I like the songs too. I already know a few of them by heart! LOL
0199267170|5|Very good paper quality, it's very thin, but hard to damage : ) The font is pretty small, but good enough for 'healthy eyes'. The only thing, indeed, is the weight... No chance that one could take this to class or something, but it's good to have one at home, instead of 20-30 books. Also, good for students, if there is a need to compare some questionable online versions of the plays to see if there are mistakes - that's what I did in our Shakespeare course...PDF in class, book at home..
B00BNUBK46|4|I like it very well thanks to Amazon!😍
B00687Q0VC|5|Very well done, made the times come to life
B009VSW15Y|2|Takes a pretty good picture but hard to use on anything but yourself. Skype is very useful when you like to see the person you are talking to and if they can access Skype.
B008M0GO0U|2|The Croc's are very tight not a full 11 size,<br />I am very dis-satisfied .<br />I need to use very thin socks, still they are to snug.<br />I would need an 11-1/2 size possibly, but none were shown in the initial offering.<br /><br />I would like to retunn the Croc's for a refund if there is nota 11-1/2 size.<br /><br />Tom Quinty
B00BSBR9N6|5|The character development is realistic and believable, even though the circumstances are unusual. Each turn of events is plausible, allowing the author to surprise you, time and again. How we read people and interpret their actions is tricky for all of us, not just those who may be wired a bit differently- so you can relate to this  book through all of the characters. A book worth reading. Enjoy.
B005S9EJ14|5|This is a little gem of a film.  Great cast/good story lines/somewhat novel setting.  The realism and humanity of the story and characters shine through.
B005K0HDGE|5|Another great book by Stephen King. An interesting story line taken from real life events. Hard to put down which is my kind of book.
B00QW8TYWO|5|This game is possibly the greatest game ever!
B000FCKIFU|5|This story could happen to the USA.  What suspense!  I am now a fan of David Baldacci.  Cannot wait to read the next \\"Camel Club\\" novel.
0743518144|4|It is amazing. I wanted to let others know where to find the access code in the audio book version (CD). I spent a lot of time looking... It's printed on the plastic under CD #1.
0393338827|5|Great look into what happened in the financial crisis. Well written, easy to read. Not jargon filled, and what there is is well explained.
B000H4QD1O|5|If your looking for, science fiction that wasn't so hokey that you cringed when watching, this is one of the good ones. I enjoyed the characters and the story line. I'm not going to give it all away but just saying it is a great series. I wish someone would pick it back up and do some more with it.
B00CF34B2I|5|This game is awesome! I don't have to be playing with other people plus it helps me to understand the game more!
B003G4W49C|5|I've yet to find a Sci-Fi book that can touch this book.<br /><br />Read this 3 times over the last 18 years, and every-time I'm extremely happy I read it again.  Also I have read most of the other books after Enders Game.  Especially Enders Shadow, which was as good or better than Enders game.  Call me crazy, but I like Bean better as a character than Ender.<br /><br />Why not have a long summary as to why its 5 stars?  A few thousand have already given an excellent review, and I can't explain better than them.
0345803485|1|I recently picked up this book at the airport, I thought I'd give it a chance considering the hype. Well, this just goes to show that most people don't know a damn thing! Why this type of literature is praised and so many other brilliant and worthy works go unnoticed I'll never understand.<br /><br />First off, the author seems to have limited sexual experience herself. If you're going to write erotica, please know what you're talking about. The writing was definitely in the style of Twilight. I did not know this book was Twilight fan fiction, knowing that fact beforehand would have kept me from reading this garbage.<br /><br />I honestly think the reason this book is popular is because of its decent cover art, and I did appreciate the musical references. But in a nutshell buy this trilogy if your a lonely housewife, even then I'd recommend just staring at the pool boy with a cocktail than reading this poo...this 50 Shades of Poo!
B004J4WLB4|5|I absolutely recommend this magical novel. It provides a unique escape into the heartbreaking world of a foster system womans life &#34;on the outside&#34; & her struggle to communicate with others.
B006VFLIYK|4|I read the hit first and thought what great book,doesn't get much better. Than I read The Innocent and was blown away.
B000NVIXFK|4|a memo to rushfan who wants another 2112 or moving pictures release------it ain't gonna happen, shouldn't ever happen, and thank allah it didn't happen with this release. topical, inspired, and sonically impressive, s & a delivers on a superior level. peart is obviously influenced by his demons lyrically but although dark it is very mature. hilites are workin them angels, good news first and the instrumentals. will be curious to see what songs will be played live outside far cry and monkey bidness and how they will handle the acoustic arrangement (if at all). embrace this work coming out in a sea of commercial crap being forced down our throats---booya.
B00N6PD3GE|4|If history books in school were written like this, I would have paid a lot more attention.  Very well researched and well written.
B00U7VDC7A|5|It's  a really cool game I love the mystery of it....There no other game like it 😁
031606792X|1|I got this book as part of the box set, but I am reviewing this book alone because it's the only one I have a strong opinion about.  To start, I am in my 30's -- I picked up the set because a number of my grown-up friends had become \\"Twilighters\\" and I had to find out what was consuming them.  I went in expecting to be entertained, if not challenged, and hopefully to find a series as engrossing as the Harry Potter books.  The first book did draw me in, but while I plowed through all four books in a weekend, I almost didn't bother to finish the fourth.    Why?  It was a mess!  Throughout the book, I kept wondering, surely, it'll get better...and it never did.  Honestly, my first thought after putting the book down was, \\"did anyone edit this?\\"    {spoilers to follow}    From the beginning, I kept waiting for a dramatic plot twist to bring some tension to the impending nuptials between Bella and Edward -- after the tortuous angst and bizarre love triangle from books 2 & 3, it was a tremendous letdown that the wedding was given such short shrift.  Where was the delicious build-up?  And where Twilight made me remember the butterflies of all those Firsts (the first touch, the first kiss, the first I Love You), I was shocked that the biggest First was over in scarcely a page.  OK, I get that this is a book aimed at young adults, but as the previous books showed, there is a lot of sensuality in words and kissing, and the author just sped past that as well.  By contrast, the gruesome birth scene was described in cringe-inducing detail -- which just exposes the inconsistencies in how our society deals with sex vs. gore.  But I digress.    Not to belabor the point that others have already raised, the desciptions of Bella's newborn life just made me groan.  Perfect mother, perfect child, perfect looks, perfect husband, perfect little cottage, perfect impulse control, perfect super powers...she even ended up with a perfect (albeit icky) resolution of the Jacob love triangle.  Igot so bored with reading about her effortless transition to her vampire life, I literally put the book down and resolved not to read any more.  Not because I wasn't rooting for Bella and Edward -- I definitely was -- but if that's all there is, why do I need to read about it for 300 more pages?  And what was the point of the previous books and the foundation that they laid about the inevitable loss of one's soul, humanity, and community when a person becomes a vampire?  I wanted to see some internal conflict, some growth, some tension, some sacrifice, and didn't get it in Breaking Dawn.  I can't even get into how inconsistently the characters had to act in order for the book to achieve this ridiculous level of \\"happily ever after.\\"    In the end, I picked it up again so I could just say I'd finished the book, but was even more disappointed with the conclusion.  I had to slog through the tedious introductions of a couple dozen new vampires, only to later discover they were all completely superfluous because of Bella's Incredible Love Shield and the convenient discovery of Nahuel, the mysterious vampire half-breed that Alice found just in the nick of time.  With that, the nasty Volturi just walks away.  So much for the vast number of witnesses brought in from around the world and the werewolf alliance that was cultivated over two books.  Was there ever a bigger literary build up for less payoff?     This book was an opportunity wasted.  I didn't love Eclipse, but at least it set up some very interesting questions for the last book:  would they actually marry?  Could Bella go through with the transformation, or would she realize the price was too high?  If she did, what would she have to give up?  Could they really live happily ever after?  The book could have dealt with just those questions, and it would have been perfect.  This series, after all, became a sensation for the love story at the heart of it all.  Instead, we get a book that puts the epic love story between Bella and Edward in the background, and throws in a ridiculous birth story, brings back Jacob from what should have been a permanent self-imposed exile, and ends with a standoff with the Volturi and a cast of dozens of vampire extras that just fizzles away.  The book takes on way too much pointless crap and the story that anyone really cared about got lost.  I can't remember ever being so disappointed at the end of a book.
B008IBPMZG|5|Excellent
B00HXYKYIE|5|Excellent character development, very suspenseful, interesting twist and very informative of elephant behavior. Another wonderful novel by one of my favorite authors. The novella was great too!
B00I29VGMC|5|Oh Archer! This was an amazing read. Very beautifully written. Great story line and characters that you fall in love with from the beginning. I'm looking forward to reading more from Mia.
B00FX8EY60|5|I Just LOVE her music. She always has new , motivational, inspirational, emotional tunes. Nit just the songs we hear in the top 40. The entire album is awesome.
B00J1IQUYM|3|I really thought I would like this book more. The premise sounds great--a troupe of actors and musicians bringing art to the survivors of a devastating flu virus. I pictured all the adventures they might have, all the trials they'd have to face, all the potential exciting parts...<br /><br />...and I got a book about an actor who died before the flu really got going, and a mysterious comic book.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong: the author's prose style is wonderful, and the book is full of compelling images. There's plenty of symbolism and so forth if you like that sort of thing (I do). I'm not a logic nitpicker, so I didn't care that it had only been 20 years and that numerous people who survived had connections with the actor, etcetera. I had no problem with the style; I wasn't expecting it to be a thrilling zombie saga or anything. It isn't a bad book.<br /><br />I just felt like the premise--what a great premise!--was wasted. We heard so little about the troupe itself, and almost nothing about the performances. Most of the troupers didn't have names--instead they were their instruments, like the tuba or the viola. The airport was as good as anything William Gibson ever came up with. But the story has so little conflict. I'm used to critical reading, and I kept looking for some kind of conflict, some kind of danger or deep emotional involvement, and there was just nothing, not even in the symbolism.<br /><br />If this was speculative fiction, I can't imagine what it was speculating about. I suppose I'm just not the target audience for this work. I wouldn't recommend it for people who want a thrilling post-apocalyptic story, or for people who want something deeper, either. Maybe for those who like extremely visual writing? I'll be interested to see the author's subsequent works.
B00B7Y0206|4|Before I got vtube, I didn't really realize how... bad the quality of the videos are on the Silk Browser. But on vtube it's perfect! So HD and smooth! Love viewing! I have a problem though. I think it's my Kindle if someone could help. I put videos into the download folder and it downloaded the first 2 videos fast! But... it stopped. Now there are just the weird loading circles on the rest of them and it won't start giving me the percent of how much has been downloaded. It doesn't look downloaded at all and I want to hopefully use this app during my off period at school since all my devices can only connect to internet via Wi-Fi and YouTube is blocked. Why won't they load? Are they considered downloaded?
0345535529|5|I got into the Game of Thrones book from my roommate in college as well as the show on HBO. Now granted these books are sometimes slower paced in some chapters and some chapters don't  have anything really happen but that's how most books are. If you watched the show and are now reading the books, some things will be ruined for you but the events are in much greater detail and other things happen that didn't happen on the show as well. I would definitely recommend this to any of my friends who love good writing as well as fantasy type books
B003M2DWE4|5|My nephew was so excited to receive this!
B004HO6I4M|5|Folks of ALL ages will enjoy this one. All about the Carnival experience in Rio de Janerio from a birds point of view that has been kidnapped. A Great Cartoon movie for kids. I recommend this one to all age groups. A lot of fun.
B005TQACLC|5|If you love Britney as much as I do, get this bluray!!! you won't regret it. she's back better than ever!! it's worth every pennie I spent! fast shipping and great packaging.

B003B02O14|4|This book was interesting and kept me reading! I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading suspenseful books
B00000IQC8|5|\\"Clerks\\" is a movie written and directed by Kevin Smith. I have almost seen all of Smiths works. He has made six movies in total. The ones I have seen are \\"Clerks,\\" \\"Mallrats,\\" \\"Chasing Amy,\\" \\"Dogma,\\" and \\"Jersey Girl.\\" The one I didn't see was \\"Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back\\" but I plan on seeing that. I have already rewarded \\"Dogma\\" with five stars, and this is probably the second best movie that he has made. The difference is that this movie is probably more realistic. The entire movie is just conversations between these characters except for one scene one the roof with a hockey match. The entire film is shot in black and white and the movie works better with the black and white. The color could describe the lives of the characters. There lives aren't so great to have everything in color, and the black and white shows how everything is the same. Every day for these characters is the same. \\"Clerks\\" is hilarious, fun, and provides some very insightful dialouge. Interesting dialouge is things about \\"Star Wars\\", the customers, and just everyday things. It is very interesting to hear what these people have to say. They are saying things that me and you would say.<br />The movie is a day in the life of two grocery store clerks. Dante and Randall. Dante has to get up every mourning, clean the grafitti off the side of the store, and have to deal with various customers. Some make him angry, and some of the them aren't a problem at all. Randall is the wise cracking and insightful guy who works right next door at the video store. The only thing is, he works in the video store, but he is always hanging out with Dante at the grocery store with the name Quick Stop. Throughout the movie, we get a look at the character's personal lives. Dante is dating Veronica Loughran, but he really wants to go out with Caitlin Bree, who he has liked since high school. As the day goes on, Dante and Randall have encounters with a hocket game that Dante has to go play, a funeral, and Jay and Silent Bob, who are two drug addicts. Jay, who is always talking and using profanity in his dialouge, while Silent Bob never talks. Every now and then he'll say one word or so, but mostly he just stands there and smokes with Jay. Dante knows that the day will end soon, but it's getting there that'll be hard.<br />\\"Clerks\\" was a great movie. It was one of the most entertaining movies that I have ever seen, and at a 90 minute running time, it felt that it was very fast. Some of the conversations were very interesting, my favorite being the one about Star Wars, and which movie is better. \\"The Empire Strikes Back,\\" or \\"Return of the Jedi.\\" It is very interesting to hear what Dante and Randall have to say about each movie. \\"Clerks\\" has been around for about ten years now, and a Ten Year Anniversary DVD is coming this year. Be sure to check it out once it comes out. The movie was originally going to be NC-17 only because of the dialouge, but an appeal brought it down to an R. I didn't think that the dialouge was that bad or explicit, but in 1994 it was a different time, and this movie is very different from others.<br />ENJOY!<br />Rated R on appeal for extensive use of extremely explicit sex-related dialogue.
B0091REZMW|3|I would give this app a higher rating on android, google play has the updates available, the game itself with no software issues has had me hooked for months now. I got all my friends into it and we post more on each other's game walls than we do on Facebook. But ever since my boyfriend &quot;upgraded&quot; me from android to the kindle fire, the game is constantly freezing up or not loading at all to begin with.  This is my favorite game to play, but it looks like I just won't be able to play on my new tab.  Anyone else running this on a kindle?
B002JVWR54|5|Although it would have been enjoyable to see where he took the show in a season 3, Joss Whedon managed to wrap this show up in a good fashion once he got the cancellation news.
B00632HWOG|4|Nice program to access emails. Almost better then going to the yahoo website. I would like a &#34;Check email now &#34; button though.
B00B8PRDHE|5|Ringo is a Winner, and his All Starr Band are Winners also. What can be said for a man that helped change the world we live in, the clothes we where, music, and has been the giver of peace and love for all these years. You'll wish you had purched this DVD if you have not yet. Ringo is the greatest in this world, the next world, or any world you can find. Great music, graet video.<br /><br />Buy it.
B007V65R54|5|Wonderful!
B000I3UMKM|5|Excellent classic movie. Great story, great roles, really an enjoyable way to spend an evening. Love Audrey Hepburn in this.
B0000584V3|5|This was the first Opeth album I bought and when I began listening to it my jaw just dropped in sheer amazement of the grandiose music that was pouring from my headphones into my ears.<BR>The structure of heavy-soft-heavy seems to be perfected in this album. Especially in the track The Funeral Portrait is this shown the most. My personal favorite tracks are The Drapery Falls, Funeral Portrait, and Bleak. All of the songs are incredible but those are the ones that I can listen to over and over and never get bored of them. There's eight songs and the cd runs for a little bit more than an hour so you have to find some spare time to listen to the whole thing without stopping. If your just getting into Opeth this is a great album to start at.
B00288KNLS|5|If you are wondering if this is a good movie. Yes. The plot? Realistically speaking, it's a semi-childrens' movie. It may be too creepy for kids but it is derived from a kids book ( Neil G.) thus it is meant for younger audiences. Don't expect a brilliant plot like Godfather part 1 or Titanic, it's not meant to be a plot masterpiece. Just an entertaining film for everyone. Sit back and enjoy it. It's amazingly fun to watch and the music is great!
B007SUW24W|4|I bought this after X and I like X better, but this one is still very very good. It took me a while to warm up to some of the songs but now I'm hooked.
B003Q6D2BE|5|Love the movie. The value of pre ordering it online was definitely worth it. Way cheaper than picking up from a local movie retailer.
B0032Y8XH8|4|I bought this album, and Babel simultaneously to get up to speed with this band, and find out why Ray Davies, Eric Clapton, Bob Dylan, Elton John, and T Bone Burnett have all wanted to perform with them both onstage and in the studio.<br /><br />My curiosity is satisfied, and I'm glad they're causing such a nice ripple in such a fickle industry. I intend to perform some of this material in the near future.
B00KNWYDU8|5|It has entertainment. You can make new dragon. You can meet new friend and battle with them. I think it's fun!!
1250027624|5|This is a very informative and beautiful book. I love seeing and reading about 'behind-the-scenes' activities. It's a book to read over and over, and view the photos from time to time.
B007IXWKUK|5|I love these books. I blush and giggle like a little girl every time I read them. Wow wow wow
B00D7Z4GQY|5|Wonderful storyline, I love this book so much! Highly recommended!
B006VFLIYK|2|Writing is not good, story kind of interesting but pretty much guessed the whole thing. Was bored but had to simian what I started.
B00G2GMRCU|5|This is my first David Baldacci book.  This was an intriguing fast paced story.  I was looking for a short story to read and after checking the reviews purchased this one.  Great choice!  Being the first book I've read with these characters, I was unfamiliar with some background however it did not take away from the story for me.  Recommend to anyone wanting a quick read mystery/thriller - not sure how to categorize it, but you have got to read it.  I must now continue on in the Will Robie and/or Camel Club books.
B00957T6X6|5|Excellent series.
B00003XB8K|2|Enigma have done some great stuff but there's not much greatness to be had on this CD. It is all pretty much self-indulgent and repetitive. Some tracks hint at some cool melodic ideas but they are never developed or taken advantage of. The only true stand-out track on this CD is Modern Crusaders, which just happens to be BRILLIANT and is worth buying the CD alone. It's a shame, and unusual, that nothing else on this CD is recommendable. Enigma can usually be relied upon to come up with unique atmospheres and moods, but not this time.
0688101364|5|This is the only Christmas cookie book you need.  This book is always pulled out at the start of the holiday season.  Not only do the georgeous pictures put you in the holiday spirit but it also reminds me of the delicious memories of the wonderful cookies I have made from this book.  I know that the binding may crack(7 years and still whole) but wouldn't you rather have a well-loved book that you use or a perfect binding of a book that never gets a second glance.  Sequel Please.

B00EW9GQR6|5|There aren't enough words to explain how amazing this album is. All of the songs are so amazing. Her lyrics are better than any other artist's out there. This album is sooooooo good!!
B0050PYNP8|5|A fun movie.  It's fun to see Simon Pegg and Nick Frost in different roles than their previous work.  The supporting actors are all great too.  Good plot, with well thought out dialogue.
B006OOHYIC|5|Good!!!
B005IQZB14|4|I saw the movie and then read the book. The book was inspirational. It made me want to go out and make a brave trip on my own. Even if it is to a hotel a couple hours away. Haha!
B005LAIGOQ|1|worst movie seen in a very long while Daniel made me waste money.  don't be fooled.  total exploitation of his potterness.
B003F44QRQ|5|Outstanding classic
B00005ATQF|5|When Saving Private Ryan came out, it inspired a craze for war movies in a many people.  War was hip again.  Of course, Enemy of the Gates came out: a horrible piece of dirt.  So, that's the reason I saw Full Metal Jacket, which in many respects, is just as good as Saving Private Ryan (SPR from now on).  I found myself comparing every war movie to SPR, as if I had exprienced war myself.  But Full Metal Jacket is very different.  Besides from being a different war and different generations, the characters in Full Metal Jacket seemed more effective.  In SPR, the characters were stereotypical, merely representations, I think.  You could compare the character Upham from SPR to Gomer Pyle (beautifully played by the underrated Vincent D'Onofrio).  Gomer Pyle's character is much more dark and disturbing and doesn't find courage in the end.  He shows the horrors soldiers suffer without even going over seas.  The Drill Sergeant at Paris Island is one of the best characters in cinema history next to Wolverine, Greg Focker, anyone in Goodfellas and Tyler Durden.  He is not a D.I. who softens up at the end and really cares for his special, unique soldiers.  He is in their face, intense, fast-talking and even violent in order to make them into killing machines.  Some say that the first half of the movie in the boot camp is the best part; I say they are either lying or fairy tale characters.  The second half that actually takes place in the Vietnam War is wonderful.  The movie follows Matthew Modine's character Joker through out Boot Camp and in Vietnam.  Matthew Modine does a great job as the witty character who is easy to relate with but doesn't have flashbacks of his best friend back home every five minutes.  The movie does a great way of showing his alteration without painting it on a billboard.  My favorite part of the movie is that they all have cool nicknames.  This movie makes the proccess of giving nicknames look really easy.  Speaking of nicknames, the dialogue in thismovie rocks- meaning really good.  It's funny, effective, displays emotions and above all, is realistic.  Especially the D.I.'s scenes.  When you watch other movies D.I.'s, they seem so fake and a guy who calls men 'ladies'.  But the best scene in the movie (in my opinion of course- Amazon), is the last scene which involves an enemy sniper.  It's so neat.  The character Animal Mother's performance here is superb.  Although it's a movie, it still seems heroic.  The music that starts up when they look for the sniper is genious.  It's so eerie and truly shows who Stanley Kubrick was (because we've all met him).  And the very last scene (a big group of soldiers walking in the night singing the theme to the Mickey Mouse Club Show) is awe-inspiring.  You see these nem say and do awful things, but they can still sing corny songs in tune.   To sum it all up, this is one the greatest movies ever made.  You know it's great when so many lines are brutally copied from it without proper recongnition.  Some could say it is better then SPR, but I say it depends what mood you are in.  If you want realistic war with classical moods, go for SPR, but if you want expressionistic depictions with cool nicknames, get a FULL tank of gas, put the pedal the METAL, if it's cold wear a JACKET, and rent that one movie.
B00CTEP7O4|5|I love this show! Character development is great, dialogue is full of witty banter. Currently on Season 2 and am still enjoying!
B007HACDLK|4|Good book, but a little slow.  Liked the early books when I would read through the night to find out the ending.
B00E5Q1LTY|5|Totally AWESOME MOVIE!!  Loved IT!!
B00DZ83IPS|3|Good. Not great.
B008Y768XO|4|It's not my favorite kind of movie, but it was good. Well-acted and interesting enough. I watched it with my 7 year old daughter, and we cried together. I like that the story was based on truth.
0385333846|3|Perhaps I missed the boat, but \\"Slaughterhouse-Five\\" just doesn't come across as hilarious and eye-opening as many see it in my opinion.  Sure, there's no denying Vonnegut's satirical viewpoint, but the story is just too disjointed and jumbled to really enjoy it.  Vonnegut uses Billy Pilgrim to get his point across that war isn't worth it.  In a perfect world, we wouldn't need war.  However, there comes a point when shaking hands and talking over tea just doesn't work anymore.  It's obvious that Vonnegut disagreed with the actions taken at Dresden (He was there), but he fails to mention the reasoning behind the attack on that particular place.  Also, he gives us a brief glimpse at conditions in the German concentration camps but fails to fully paint the picture of just how cruel these places were.  In short, what you have here is one man's viewpoint of warfare.  If you agree with him, you'll probably think his sarcastic remarks are hilarious.  However, if, like me, you see war as an unwanted but sometimes necessary evil, you may tire of Vonnegut's lingo rather quickly.<br /><br />In closing I must say that this book just wasn't for me.  When I was in college I happened to see the film that's based on this book and I actually enjoyed it.  Perhaps age and real world experience have rubbed the sand out of my eyes and I now see this book for what it really is?  I'm not saying that this book is bad, but I won't recommend everybody go out and read it either.
0385344430|3|It really is an OK book.  Honestly, for the 5 year wait, I was hoping for more excitement, especially considering the cliff hanger of the last book.  I am a bit of an artist myself, so I understand you can't force the muse.  But I just felt like there are parts that could have been explored more, and others less, to really round it out.  I felt similarly to the end of Wheel of Time.  I just don't feel like I want to re-read this one, as I did with other of the Outlander books.  Of course I'll read the next one, and anxiously await it.
B00HGJ18C2|5|I love playing the solitaire all the time.
B000000OPZ|5|This album was among &quot;the best of the best&quot; of all the great hard rock albums that came out in 1987.  The combination of classic and melodic hard rock make this an all time mainstream rock masterpiece.<br />&quot;Still Of The Night&quot; is, beyond a doubt, one of the best hard rocking tracks of all time.  Clocking in at just over 6:30, this song just doesn't let up!  Begins and ends heavy with a slight slowdown in the middle for dramatic effect.  Obviously the two huge radio hits &quot;Here I Go Again&quot; and &quot;Is This Love&quot; are fantastic--the epitome of a time when pop radio was listenable.  &quot;Give Me All Your Love&quot; is an underrated track--I particularly love the exploding drums at the end of the track.  &quot;Cryin' In The Rain&quot; and &quot;Children Of The Night&quot; both are great heavy rockers, and &quot;Don't Turn Away&quot; is an excellent anthem to end the album.<br />Quite simply, there is not a bad track here.  Nearly 15 years after its release, this album is just as rocking and enjoyable to me today as it was when it came out.  Absolutely an essential purchase for fans of '80s melodic hard rock.

B00K2CHWOI|4|I seem to prefer Tom Cruise in Sci Fi movies, especially Minotity Report & Oblivion. However, EmilyBlunt made the movie. Wolfman & Looper would have not been the same without her! I wish she would play MORE FEMALE &#34;HERO&#34; AND ACTION LEADS. I liked Tom in this movie, but without Emily Blunt, it would no thave been so much fun and interesting!!
0062190377|5|Very good book. Interesting concept. Expect to see a film version in the near future.
0007447868|5|There are two main complaints about this book:<br /><br />1)  Not enough happens in it.<br />2) WHERE ARE MY FAVORITE CHARACTERS?!?!!?!<br /><br />The funny thing is that the last chapter addresses the audience directly and answers these questions.  The book was too long to publish by itself so rather than split it down the middle GRRM decided to break it up by characters.<br /><br />Personally I think this is a brilliant decision.  The first two books are pretty consistent in terms of action, but 'Clash of Kings' is so crammed with surprises that it dramatically changes the landscape of the series.  Continuing that level of action unabated would get boring after a while (to say nothing of the fact that there wouldn't be any characters left to write about).  'A Feast for Crows' helps to give context and meaning to the previous books by focusing on what the characters have lost, how it's changed them, and the unintended consequences of their actions.<br /><br />It also lets us catch our breaths after book three, and leaves us wanting more for book five.

B0001WTUH6|5|Selene is a vampire Death Dealer, one who lives to hunt and kill Lycans. She seeks revenge on all Lycans because she is told by Viktor, her dark father, that Lycans killed her family. She enjoys her job until she meets Michael, a human recently turned into a Lycan. Selene is torn between her coven and her feelings for Michael.<br /><br />Michael is a human hunted by the Lycans for his unique DNA. When he is bitten by a Lycan, he is pulled into the middle of a centuries old war of Vampires against Lycans.<br /><br />The war between the Vampires and the Lycans has raged for centuries, but the Vampires think that most of the Lycans are dead after their leader, Lucian, is killed. Selene uncovers a possible betrayal of the coven when she discovers that Lucian is very much alive. This sets off a series of events leading to the revelation that the war was not started the way Selene was told it was started. Lies, betrayal and forbidden love all come to an explosive finale.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this movie because I thought the story was good, creating an intriguing myth for the relationship between Vampires and Lycans. Underworld moved along at a fast pace, keeping the viewer interested. At first, the good guys and the bad guys seem clear until the end when the truth is revealed. The look and feel of the movie was dark and gloomy, which fit perfectly with the story. Well-developed characters dominate the screen, breathing life into ancient mythic creatures. I especially liked Selene with her dour attitude and how she stood up to the controlling Kraven. You go girl! What I also liked about her character is that her hair was messed from the rain and all the fighting she was doing, which is realistic. She still looked hot. I hate when female warriors have hair that does not move or get messed up after fighting. I would have loved to see more romance develop between Selene and Michael. Hopefully this will happen in the sequel. I highly recommend this movie to fans of dark fantasy and vampire and werewolf lore.s of dark fantasy and vampire and werewolf lore.

B001I45UFC|5|What a great story should be. My 8 year old son can't wait to read the next book. Neither can I.
B005HJU7HA|4|I reread the Complete Sherlock Holmes at least once every couple of years.  This is a solid collection in a good format.  Excited to have it on my Kindle.  There are some issues with font size and spacing, as well as some missing images, but overall I can't complain too much.
B008NCSZQ8|5|With the caveat that this is a movie about comic book characters and not a great work of art, this is a totally fun movie. Action with humor, and some really fun characters.
0441172717|5|What can you say about Dune? Simply put, I loved this book. The political commentary was on point and reminiscent of colonization: it demonstrated the open exploitation of a people (Fremen) by outside market interests (House Harkonnen, the Emperor, the Guild) and the subsequent rebellion that led to revolutionary decolonization. The book also made a foray into religion, a sort of savage religion, in the tales of Muad'Dib and the prophetic Kwisatz Haderach, and environmentalism popped up with the vision of Liet-Kynes to turn an entire desert community into a lush garden planet.<br /><br />Frank Herbert does an incredible job and is an outstanding story teller who can blend different plot elements and themes under the embrace of science fiction. That is precisely why whenever science fiction is brought up, Dune is always the first book mentioned. It really is an outstanding story.<br /><br />Take it from me, someone who does not generally enjoy science fiction, Dune is just a great book, period. Disregarding all genres and labels, Dune is a solid work of fiction, entirely worth the read.

B0064W67IM|5|Amazing - as always! The very talented Niel Gaiman. :) I noticed that Neil thinks the story is a bit problematic in this one, but I didn't notice that all, I thought it was beautiful and Sandman haunts my dreams now. :)
B007Y6OZE0|5|Great album,but you don't expect a Smash...have a listen a few times.<br />Listening for a while now,and I muss admit is better than RAFRAG and I would say in somehow,quite similar to Americana.<br />It has few songs that will make you jump like long long time ago,but if you are negative,some songs will make you hate them a bit more (we should know that Offspring is like this,making the difference!) but give a try...4-5 songs are the best in them last 14 years!very good album.
B0094M4N9E|1|bad
0780622642|1|How can you tell that this movie is really, really lame? <br /> <br />Simple.  It takes good actors like Gary Oldman and Mimi Rogers, and makes them seem as inept as that heroically bad actor, William Hurt. <br /> <br />The real problem is the writing. <br /> <br />The dialogue is painfully bad.  At one point Mimi Rogers says, \\"I don't like the sound of that sound.\\"  And that's the way the whole thing is written: clumsily, clankingly, ridden with cliches, melodrama, and ineptness. <br /> <br />Also (bad writing again) the characters are dizzyingly inconsistent.  For no discernible reason, they flicker between being smart and dumb (Judy), dumb and dumber (West), cowardly and schizoid (Smith), nerdy and compassionate (Will).   <br /> <br />And then there's the plot.  Or, I should say, plots.  There are at least 3, maybe 10.  All of them tired-but-untrue, none of them very much connected with each other. <br /> <br />Even the vaunted special effects are silly. <br /> <br />I'm sure a lot of money was spent on this.  Please be wiser, and don't spend any of yours.
B0031YJFCQ|4|Very, very good book.  However, I wish I would have read the first two before I read this one.  The background knowledge would have been helpful.  I still found the story/plot compelling and had a hard time putting the book down.
0767802519|2|Given the almost universal high ratings for this movie, I must be missing something. The movie had potential, it *could* have been something, but it kept dragging itself down with dumb. Jean Reno stars as a professional hit man who 'adopts' a 12-year old played by Natalie Portman. The girl was recently orphaned when a crazed DEA agent played by Gary Oldman guns down her family in the apartment down the hall from Reno's.<br /><br />The movie should have been played straight and serious or absurd and comic or schmaltzy and cute, but it wandered between the three. It included ridiculous details that stopped me from taking it seriously (e.g., the DEA knows a 12-year old girl is missing from the apartment, one of them saw a young girl enter Reno's apartment right after the shootings, but they don't bother to search it). Once Reno lets the girl stay with him, he immediately agrees to train her as a hit man. A 12-year old. She manages a long-range hit with her first shot.<br /><br />Portman toys with her blossoming sexuality, but it isn't pushed even to the point of making the viewer seriously uncomfortable. Better to have left that bit out or played it out.<br /><br />An opportunity is missed when hints are dropped that Reno's boss, who supposedly holds all his money for him, is ripping him off. But that goes nowhere.<br /><br />The movie is well-acted and they do blow up a lot of stuff, but it was a missed opportunity and generally waste of time.
B0000047D5|5|That's about the only way I can describe my new found love for this master of jazz piano playing.  Anyone who knows almost nothing about jazz knows names like Charlie Parker, Dexter Gordon, Paul Gonsalves, Erroll Garner, etc., but can rarely ever identify their work in a &quot;crowd&quot;.  I was the same way about Oscar Peterson and his magnificent trio.  Being a saxophone fan, I have more than enough Stan Getz and Johnny Hodges and Dexter Gordon in my collection (if there can be &quot;enough&quot; of that wonderful music!) and decided to try something else for my ever growing collection of 900+ cds.  Thankfully, the titles on this particular disc drew me in.  Oscar and his trio were very tight knit and very much in synch with each other, and the results are more than evident here.  Treatments of &quot;People&quot;, &quot;Quiet Nights&quot; and &quot;Days Of Wine &amp; Roses&quot; are nothing short of magnificent.  I particularly enjoyed the swagger and swing of &quot;Days Of Wine &amp; Roses&quot;.  One of the longer gems on this set is &quot;My One And Only Love&quot;, a done-to death standard that has withstood the test of time.  (Lynne Arriale's another fine pianist who covered this one in the early 90's with similarly beautiful results)  Oscar segues from time to time to other well-known tunes during this piece and evokes smiles while placing a gentle tag of his own on this evergreen.  Perhaps my most favorite piece on this disc comes in the little known &quot;You Look Good To Me&quot;, with its touching intro (and close) and the utter jam session in between while never straying from what I believe the composers meant by the title.  An excellent starting point to your soon to be large Oscar Peterson collection!
031606792X|3|I am in love with the Twilight series.  I have read all of the books atleast 4 times with the exception of this one.  It is not a bad book.  The story is still very interesting.  I just feel like it could have been more; could have been better in some ways but this doesnt make it a bad book.    I have no problem with the story line itself.  I just wish that parts of the book could have given us more.  For example - the wedding went by so quickly.  Stephanie is usually so detailed about everything and every conversation but it was lacking here.  We did not see just how happy Bella was to be getting married and how she felt about becoming a part of the family now that her wedding day was actually here.  In the other books Bella was so against marriage.  Stephanie showed in detail her dislike for the institution.  But on the actual day we dont get the other side.  Should we assume that she is ok with it now or just ready to get busy with Edward.    Speaking about getting busy, no discription at all; not even a kiss.  What happened.  I dont care for detailed sex scenes, but she really gave us nothing on this one.  I also thought that while on the honey moon maybe Edward and Bella could have a conversation about how far they have come or about him changing her and what that would mean to him for her to want to be with him forever.  But they really had no conversations.  Just a lot of Edward distracting her so that she would not want to have sex.    I thought Jacobs part of the story was funny and very well written.  I think it kind of carried the story.  Bella as  a mom is fine, Bella as a vampire is fine too but still, where are Edwards thoughts now that she is actually a vampire.  She completely gave up her life for him and they dont even have a conversation about it.    The voltouri portion was fine.  I am glad that no one got killed but it would have been nice for Bella to get to fight since she wanted to opportunity to fight with Edward like Alice and Jasper.    So,the book is worth reading.  I am sad to see the series end.  This is their story it was a great love story I just wish there had been more.
B002UXRGM0|1|If you live in the United States, DO NOT BUY this!!  It will not play on US DVD players.  This is a British series, recorded in 50hz.  US players are not equipped to read them.<br /><br />I downloaded the series onto my television.  The show is PHENOMENAL.<br /><br />Purchasing this Blu-Ray, however, should simply be out of the question.

B008Y7B3NY|1|The fact that he ignored own wife, to the point of driving her away, was devastating.  Though the rest of the storyline was beautiful, this one thing honestly ruined the movie for me altogether. Wish he would've stayed true to her- esp being a children's movie.
B005H1SDQU|4|It's been awhile since I've visited a Steve Hackett album and I stumbled across this one the other day and enjoy it very much. Compared to much of the dreck out there these days this is tasty, mature, varied music for those of us who are past head banging, power chords and shock lyrics but aren't ready for the Norah Jones crowd yet either. Do yourself a favor and pick it up and listen to it on a good sound system. It will take you back to the days 30-40 years ago when music was THIS good. You will not be sorry.

B00129H7VS|5|I wanted to join the military because of a veteran I knew who got a purple heart and was left looking like Harvey in batman. So veterans have and will always have a very special place in my heart for what they did. Those that had the heart of a volunteer and those that are patriots for life. But my dreams of joining are shattered by a drunk driver and lying insurance agents. My state farm insurance agent screwed me over and told me that I had the highest coverage for everything but my underinsurance actually wasn't. But I want everyone to know so more people will know how corrupt insurance companies are in California. (not the same in the 49 other states, your underinsurance can't be below your liability unless you purposely wanted to opt out knowingly.)
B00GYQYL7W|2|Boring. I couldn't get into this, even fast forwarded through parts.
B0036S4B6M|3|I'm only 1/3 through the book but it is disappointing.  No character development at all.  If you are enjoying the netfilx series, you will be disappointed with the book.  Perhaps there will be some redeeming quality later on, but for now, it doesn't measure up to the tv version.<br /><br />Could be better if you read the book before you saw the show?

B00E6Z0THE|3|The only thing that got to me was all the back-and-forthing.  BUT--The map system is terrific, showing in very good detail 'where' you're looking for--there are so many places to explore I would have been lost without it, literally.<br />A hint system on-board, although a few of them are in French, and a pick-axe is called a 'peak'.  Almost another mini-puzzle, trying to translate.  I had to use an on-line walkthrough, too (nice to not be stuck forever--the next move wasn't always logical to me).<br />I enjoyed the tons of mini-games even though my finger is exhausted from all the running around.<br />Played perfectly on Kindle Fire 2nd gen.<br /><br />UPDATE: 2-27-14--I was asked where I found the walkthrough-- appunwrapper.com --has the one I think I used.  At least it's an actual walkthrough--not just a help forum. It can be hard to find walkthroughs for some game brands.  Not being able to finish a game makes me crazy!

B00QN25MMK|4|Great job with official debut.  I've been following joey since 1999 mixtape and summer knights. Good flow, good beats throughout.  Best thing about the album is that it doesn't play down to some of the current trends, but it also doesn't sound so underground that it gets boring. I just hope that he gets the attention he deserves.  This is a really strong debut album.
B001BHFYNY|3|I have mixed feelings about this album. It holds a special place because it is his final studio album with some live tracks. Side 1 (I know many will only listen to the CD) for me isn't his best. I not a big fan of 'Unchained Melody' although it is the best song on that side. 'Little Darlin' is just terrible... Elvis isn't bad but the song is bad. I know he's just having a bit of fun with the song but... I would say it's his worst song. However, side 2 makes up for the first side. Starts off well with 'Way Down' then builds up to the superb 'It's Easy for You.' This song sends a chill up my spine every time I listen to it and the line &#34;call me in a year or two&#34; makes me sad... which doesn't sound good but allows you reflect on the man and not just the image.<br />I know many people who don't mind Elvis, or are casual fans, like the songs on Moody Blue album as opposed to his other 70s music. I disagree, but... there you go.
630463949X|5|This is a really great DVD for both the Fleetwood Mac fan as well as audiophiles wishing to pick up a really nice Demo disc.  I won't say that all the tracks are fantastic.  The songs you know, are all above average when compared to the recorded classics.  Over half of those are great.  And at least two or three of them are exceptional.  My favorite on this disc is Silver Stream.   I have no idea why it wasn't put on the album years ago when it was recorded(the rumour album if I recall correctly).  Plus, there are a couple songs sung by Lyndsey Buckingham that should surprise the casual fan.  Overall, I really enjoyed it and look forward to purchasing another of their dvds.

B00DJFIMW6|5|I just love how they have costumes and attitudes. it is really just amazing how a person could come up with this stuff.
B00004XQ83|5|This CD is amazing to me. Everyone seems to love it, regardless of what music you typically lisen to. It is great to see different generations, classes, races, - whatever - relate to the same body of music.<br />The reason why, I think, is that the music on this album has a certain purity about it. Stright forward and honest, yet spiritual and deeply moving. It is impossible to listen to this album without a warm comfort wrapping itself around you.
B00KA7JIII|5|The most unique game I have ever played and by far the most thought provoking, ALOT of work went into the mechanics and physics of this gem. I just can't put it down. 😀
B00003CXCQ|5|One of my personal favorites and my first purchase so I was skeptical and a little unsure of what to expect. But all put to rest once I was enjoying it and I did enjoy and still do. Awesome!
B00003CXA6|4|You have got to understand. I love this movie. Being a reenactor myself, i take great pride in watching the movie not only for historical purposes, but to also see some of my friends in it as well. BUT WHY one disc?? Why do I have to turn over the disc to watch the second half of the movie. Its a shame. Movie like this coming out on dvd. Its what dvds are specially known for, their compression to have more room on a disc. Why not just have the movie itself on one disc and the extras on another. I would well pay the extra money for it. For that I give this dvd 4 stars. Maybe in the future they will reconsider their fault and make it 2 discs.
B000M341QE|3|Will somebody please tell me what all the fuss is about?<br /><br />Yes, Marty was due for a ton of things he should have won for in the past. Yes, DiCaprio gives a damn fine performance here. But BEST picture?<br /><br />Surely not.<br /><br />This is a film that is nicely done. It is well made. Outside of Marky-Mark, who is way over the top in his role, there's not really a weak link in the cast (though Nicholsen once again pretty much plays himself). I just don't see what sets this one apart.<br /><br />I'm kind of glad I don't have a vote for best picture. This year was thin on good movies, much less great ones. The Departed is a B, maybe a B+ movie at best. Great?<br /><br />Nope.<br /><br />Which brings me to what is probably my biggest critique of the film: you better have a Hamlet on your hands if your gonna be littering the stage with bodies at the end. There is no prince of Denmark here--just a bunch of blood and bagpipes.
B00DM12RBY|5|Well developed love story. Dealt with several complex issues. I was surprised and pleased with the ending.
B00QW8TYWO|5|So I just got the app but it is now my favorite app I ever downloaded it is fun and addicting I really recommend this awesome app.
B0091LS07E|5|What happened to me with Alicia Keys is similar to what happened with Taylor Swift.  I only heard one song and I loved it and then I ran and bought the CD in Amazon.  Both are great, Taylor's songs (written by her) are out of this world, and Alicia Keys rendition of &#34;Girl on Fire&#34; gave me goosebumps.  So much talent. Thank God is channeled in a positive way.
6304925131|3|I heard the audio tape, before I bought the video. I think that the book is better than the film, although the film is fine. If I should say something that I do not like about this film, it must be that the women come out so weak. The only one that tries to work out something on her own, is the sick boy's mother. She has been fighting for her son's life. Sadly, this is a battle she loses.
B0067R0APK|4|Good
1614270198|5|I'm taking my time studying this information in book. I would also like to get is tape soon. Everything in it makes a lot of sense.
B00007GZR5|5|Very sad yet beautiful movie.  One of the few serious works of Robin Williams and shows a whole different side of him.
B003XMUFGQ|5|What's to write, his music his vocals are perfect. He is still the heart and soul of real rock music. If you are a Clapton Fan then this is a Must Have. I have mine, do you?
B00F4PM6WG|5|So cute and simple. My toddler loves it. He is currently obsessed with trains.
B000XUBFE2|5|It seems inadequate to write a review of such an incredible book. I can only say this book is necessary, and unforgettable.
B005OZE9SA|2|Hardware just OK. Ableton software stinks. Had to pay for sound forge to get my recording job done.
B00BD99JMW|3|Requires you suspend disbelief and shift scenes a bit too often to flow smoothly. I had hoped for a more satisfying end.
B005IQZB14|5|I've been on many sections of the PCT and now I want more, what an inspirational story, the movie is Great but the book is Outstanding!
B004J4WLB4|5|The language of flowers was a very sweet well written novel that captured the unjust, unkind, beautiful, thoughtful, and loving qualities of the world and human nature. I was drawn in by the characters immediately. The author took a wonderful idea, the meaning of flowers, and educated the reader on a lost art of communication. I really liked how the main character struggled with her own vulnerabilities and kept working at life until she could find meaning and peace. I have recommended this book to many others,
0783230079|3|I thought this movie was fair!! It was not as good to me as it sounded! You may like it!
B001KVZ6HK|5|First the obvious!!This is probably one of the best super heroes movies ever!!!That no one can argue about it.<br />The delivery perfect!So kuddos to Amazon.<br />The dvd case is just lame!!That is my opinion, I recently purchased the same combo (Blu-ray 3d/blu-ray/dvd/digital copy) for Transformers III, What a big difference!!<br />The Avengers case feel cheap comparing to the Transformers case, mostly because in The Avengers you place you discs one in top of other!!!!Awful!!Quite obviously is cause they gonna dime us for the \\"Ultimate\\" or what ever is call version to be release soon.
B003ZJJHWK|4|I was introduced to Antony through a British television show called Later With Jools, a fantastic venue where bands perform live.    At first I didn't know what to make of Antony's voice.  It's so...different, yet...familiar.  I took the bait and bought The Crying Light and it took a bit of time before the album hit me on the head.  I admit it took me a while but I realized I was listening to someone pretty special, uniquely special and ultimately greatly special.      It's awfully hard to offer a critique of Antony's latest album (or really, any of his albums).  I've yet to read a real and examined critique of Swanlights (and nor should my little critique be considered fully examined).  You really do have to live with an Antony album for A WHILE before putting pen to paper but of course the media is not going to wait.    I am surprised at how much is apparently immediate to me in this album.  There is something accessible to me about Antony's latest efforts.  And believe me, it's not like I understand what Antony's is doing or where Antony's going with Swanlights but it seems much more effortless and accessible to me.    Antony is truly musically earnest and it works rather well.  What can I say at this point?  This is another great effort by Antony.
B005ZMTXMY|5|Tremendously enjoyable movie my toddler loves!
B00AZL3PBK|4|I like it but I don't care for how you every time you fall you die how about change it a shamrock
B00190KZUU|4|This is just a very heart warming story full of love and imagination. The relation between man and life is seen through the eyes of creativity.... life will be what you want it to be. Loved it!!!!
B00AOB5I1Q|5|What a timeless fun movie that inspires the young imagination!
1611762863|5|Wonderful. Listened to it on Audible. Love the reader's Australian accent -- perfect for the setting. Everyone I know whose read it loves it.
B005MMJ84K|5|This had a crazy ending and kept me interested the entire book. I can't wait to read the next one.
B00I8Q77Y0|5|Thugs game is awesome! If you like flappy bird then your going to like this! Great for challenging your friends and raging!
B007N85POS|5|I love this game
B000002VCU|5|This album is the pinnacle of musical achievement. It is the ruler against which all rock music should be judged. I bought this CD in 1994, during a bad relationship. Now I had heard &quot;Games People Play&quot; on the  radio for years, but I never paid much attention to it. When I played the  CD, it got to my soul! &quot;Games People Play&quot;, especially the lines  &quot;Where do we go from here, now that all of the children have grown  up?...&quot; and &quot;Ain't gonna spend the rest of my life quietly fading  away&quot;, spoke to me. How many people have had these feelings!<br />This  album helped turn my life around. In 1996, I married a terrific woman, and  this album is also her favorite!<br />You must get this CD. Buy it, play  it--over and over. This is one of the greatest albums of all time.
B004SJ3BCI|5|I love this game! It was my first game on my kindle fire. I like to collect the plushies. BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B006XIR9KM|5|It is a match game that takes it to a new level of difficulty by moving tiles in you while you are playing
B002MQYOFW|5|Very fast shipping and product  as described.  Will shop with them again in the future.<br />Thank you very much.<br />:)
B0033AGPFS|5|This LP is from the Jimi Hendrix collection. New in package, fast shipping, and very great sound quailty. The price is unmatched and you get it NEW, unlike the old copies on e-bay.
B007JRU2UK|5|I was pleasantly surprised at how good the movie was.  It's very unique.  The story line is very deep and hits on a lot of emotion about death and love.
B002OFWG7O|5|Best band since the Beatles and Zeppelin
B00GBCMW9S|1|When I request a digital download... I expect to be able to use it without loading your crappy software! There is no need to load your cloud player when I ALREADY HAVE A PLAYER!!!!
B0054JZC6E|5|I love every single game in there!!!  Best game ever!!!<br /><br />My older sister loves it to. ( she is beautiful. A lot of boys stare at her.)
B001CT877Q|5|Blu-Ray In Excellent Shape.  Very Fast Delivery. Awesome Seller.  Will Buy From Again.
B001U7NW0C|4|Will, Grace, Karen & Jack, throw in some great guest stars and you've got a fun &#34;best of&#34; in two discs.
B007IXWKUK|1|These stories are horribly written, lack any true feelings, and are a waste of time. He is a selfish man, NOT a dom at all. He gives NO aftercare. He is supposed to be the one in control of her pleasure, but he is too self-centered. She is a childish flake and doesn't even try to understand the process of the lifestyle. But of course with him teaching her she'll never learn.   *SPOILER* :  By the end of the third book, they are not together anymore, and it's a waste of time. :( There is so much wonderful erotic BDSM writing out there, it's a shame this gets the attention. Read Cherise Sinclair, Eden Bradley, or Kennedy Layne for well written, safe, sane and consensual sex scenes.
B00EMJBVAI|5|Great movie
B008XG1X18|5|I freaking love this app. I don't have a creative bone in my body, so Pinterest is where I come to get all of my ideas. I've gotten great ideas for my classroom, recipes, and even nail designs!!!
0857522329|5|Excellent
B00DR0PDNE|3|Easy to install. Works well if your devices are the latest. For me, I have a lot of recent devices but this really only works with my Samsung galaxy 4. My Samsung tablet that is no more than a year old won't work. Had to uninstall app.<br /><br />Don't think this is fully baked yet.
0671042858|2|I haven't read a lot of Stephen King's books, but from the few I have read, I can honestly say he's capable of better than this.<br />(I believe even Mr King admitted as much.)<br />There is very little character development, which gives one little reason to care if Trisha escapes the woods, in fact you pretty much know she will.
B00005JKZ3|5|mib 2 is just as sweet as the first one. this movie rocks. i recomend this movie for everyone
B00E3BK0QQ|3|I think the developers have been getting a little too greedy. Yes,  this is a good point-and-click adventure game that does not have those annoying,  unconnected HOGs. However,  the free part we were given was not that much (we didn't need that &quot;riding in the snow&quot; scene.) Then,  we are expected to pay $4.99 - in my state,  now,  $5.34 since Amazon tacked on tax,  to play the rest. We don't even know how much more of the game there is. It's a shame that those of us who have been filling the pockets of the &quot;famous brand&quot; game companies since Kindle started, are now treated this way. Going to play my old games - the ones that were reasonably priced,  and were good.
B002SR2PKG|5|Hi love this book. King at his best!
B00CB4ET0K|5|I enjoy playing this game so much, I frequently blow off my workouts so I can fire up my Kindle and blow away some Nazis.  The story really does a good job of making you feel like you're part of the D Day invasion.  I'd like to see some more blood and guts like Saving Private Ryan, but then it is free.
B00BD99JMW|1|**SPOILER**  Bought the Kindle Edition to finish out the trilogy, and wish I hadn't. Although I am NOT a YA, I enjoy a good story, no matter whom it's aimed at. I felt really excited to find out how the story turned out, but I was entertained more by Penny's review than I was by reading this book. I too, felt the plot was pegged together without any thought to the reader who invested so much in the first two books, and the reason for everyone being in the City was just unbelievable. I knew before reading the book that a main character was killed off, but like most reviewers, agree that it was NOT necessary for the plot, especially since Tris had discovered she really WANTED TO LIVE and there were so many alternatives for the plot to go in another direction. It made absolutely no sense for her to be a martyr the way it played out. Extremely disappointed Ms. Roth sold out the story just to complete the book contract.
B0091REZMW|4|fun game to play hard to get what you need. but fun trying. like that freinds can get involved. wish you could get diamonds easier.
B00005JKCH|4|Its great because it's the first one with Tobey Maguire, but with the new Spider-Man movie out I can see this becoming a relic in our home.
6305627401|5|I am a huge South Park fan and I thought that the movie was incredible! I laughed and laughed. The plot was exquisite and the language was the best part. I am a minor and I still saw the movie. I wouldn't recommend this  movie to anyone who gets offended easily. The best part is where Cartman  has the v-chip installed in him. I have also seen the vhs version and I  prefer the dvd version. The soundtrack is just as good. There is only one  flaw in the entire movie: it's just no long enough. Still, it definitely  deserves five stars!
0684833395|1|In my words Catch-22 is overrated.  This book could have been summed up in one chapter, and in all its wordiness the only point is that war is extremely boring.  Although each chapter had something exciting, Joseph Heller droned on relentlessly about a single character.  The climax of the book is when Yossarian is up in the bomber on a mission to Bologna and the gunners guts fall out, because a piece of flak went into his stomach.  The whole time the gunner is crying out \\"I'm cold, I'm cold!\\"  One side of the book that I liked was how Joseph Heller made each chapter about one person, which makes it slightly better, because the cast is always growing.  Each character is unique, and I value that, but his subject matter poor.  All in all I had to force myself to read this book.
6300214435|5|I'm a little surprised by some of the bashing this movie receives.  Yes, it does have a weaker story than either Raiders or The Last Crusade, but it does have the most action in the series, particularly the thrill-packed finale, one of the best extended action sequences ever put on film.  The action scenes here are a bit more polished than in Raiders of the Lost Ark and there's more humor, and even a kid sidekick, which might annoy some.  Overall, probably the least of the series, but even at that, it's still the third best pure action film of the 80's (behind you know what two other films).
B0086700CM|4|good game could be improved hence 4 stars tho otherwise a gr8 game. got nothing. more to add to this
B00000JNNY|5|I can't stop listening to this cd. I love the style and Etta's voice is incredible. My favorite songs are the first 3 and the last 3. She has spunk and she adds a lot to the music. She's talented. Buy this cd. This is real music. It's fun and very danceable!
B00003CXDD|5|favorite movie
B0031RAOVY|5|I have watched this twice! what a great story and a very heartwarming movie.I loved this movie for the fact that it was based on a TRUE story and my love for animals.Richard Gere was Fantastic in this movie and the role he played was very inspiring. All I can say is get the movie and watch it! it is great a movie you will want to watch again and again..don't forget the tissues though!!
B00IRISI42|5|No dead spots in the entire book.
B001GA1RFA|3|I think I am too old for his books.  My granddaughter love them.
B00MV9CHBS|5|I love this new book from Brandon, he really knows how to bring stories to life.
B00K25GL7Y|5|This game, though expensive to upgrade, contains stunning graphics, a large assortment of new M15 cards, and great story, so far. Though I have not yet bought the expansion, I believe that I will very soon.
160774273X|5|Brilliant, absolutely outstanding. If you are looking for a simple bread recipe for your bread maker, forget it. If you want to take the time to learn how to make world class bread, this is your book. Nancy Silverton's original La Brea book used to be my bible, but this book takes it a step further. Again, this is not a book for lazy people who don't want to take the time to learn a real craft. If you want a good laugh, read the one-star reviews. OMG.
B00E7T8QHY|1|I purchased this game and the complete package for pure chess. The additional chess pieces wouldn't download. I contacted amazon for help and they could not. They wanted me to contact the developer of the game. The prices indicated they would download but the did not.
B007KZY1YY|5|The best read ever ever<br /><br />I have learnt about relationships<br />I have leant about how to pease your husband<br />I have learnt how to please oneself
B00ABGEFWC|5|This game is really fun I love the adorable pets  like always there's a catch almost all the pets cost gems do u really think I'll spend money buying gems they ended to fix that problem so watch your wallet .
B009EBLCK8|5|Amazing BBC programming. I wish our American television was as great as the British taxpayer's. The performances are particularly unique.
B007ZGBZHE|3|The ending was too strange.  I didn't know it had ended.  It dragged a little.  Was a little hard to follow.
B0058VW36U|4|Definitely worth the wait for this app to launch, not necessarily worth the wait for it to load though... ridiculously slow on Samsung Vibrant.
B000777J2S|3|I deeply wanted to love this album. <br /> <br />I think that Antony is one of those rare performers for whom the act of creating music is an almost spiritual experience. That is, it is an act without ego, without any kind of pretense - it is an act purely in the service of something outside of, and greater than oneself: the music. You also get this sense in the performances of Jeff Buckley and Leonard Cohen, and the better performances of Nick Cave and Tom Waits. <br /> <br />And the performances on this album are superb. They maximally express the content of each and every song. <br /> <br />The problem is, the songs just aren't that great. <br /> <br />With Buckley, Cohen, Waits and Cave, the singer is conduit to some of the greatest popular music ever written. Antony and Johnsons' songs aren't bad, but they don't have the emotional or psychological heft of the aforementioned. <br /> <br />Compare, then, Antony's performance on the Leonard Cohen tribute of 'If it be your will'. Despite the somewhat overblown instrumental arrangements, this is a transforming experience, and everything I know that this band is capable of.
B00JVZ0DQG|5|This game is so much fun!
B001GZ6QEC|4|I viewed this movie just once, on DVD format.  My next venture into the re-invented Batman genre by Christopher Nolan would be on blu-ray, and it was just spectacular.  The detailed clarity of this film is what the blu-ray format was intended to display, at its visual apex.  The soundtrack is equally engaging, and is appropriately married to the picture quality.      A great bonus is how the movie shifts from Widescreen to Imax imaging, depending on the scene, shadowing the exact theatrical experience when you plop down your hard earned $$ for a movie show at actual theaters.  Bravo to the powers to be at Warner Bros. for duplicating this feature on blu-ray for the home theater audience.    It is very obvious that Heath Ledger stole the show on this particular movie, nothing taken away from Christian Bale's performance.  Ledger's performance as the Joker, escalates Batman's nemesis to a level never explored, short of the masterful display done by Jack Nicholson in Tim Burton's rendition of the series.  Ledger's portrayal exudes an evil that is not only physical, but psychologically tormenting, frightful & unpredictable.  As an audience, you realize that the Batman is in for the fight of his illustrious career against the likes of THIS Joker.    Ever since Christopher Nolan & Christian Bale were hired to continue the franchise, their work as director and principal actor has reinvigorated the series with a realism and grittiness that truly defines the Black Knight.  After Michael Keaton's two performances as the winged avenger, the series just morphed into sheer silliness and drowned in its own bloated pulp comic representation.    The Dark Knight is definitely one of the best, if not the best, in featuring the Batman film series.
B00DAXXO98|5|Riveting.  Great character development, great story lines that leave us hanging.  Can't wait for the next chapter.  Perfect for binge watching in the winter.
B000EMGAOY|3|I have been a big rhcp fan for years now, everyone seems to have different favorite stages of the band. The way I approached this album was starting at Blood Sugar, Californication, and By the Way. In relation to those, this album is probably the worst. Thats not to say it doesnt have some decent songs, but the overprocessed mixing and trite funk licks barely posess the same raw energy the band once had. Albeit, there are 28 tracks and I'm sure everyone is bound to find a handful of favorites. I would recommend it to any fan, but it is defenitely no masterpiece
B001LF2WCC|5|I thought this was a great movie.  When the price dropped on this Blu-Ray edition to under $15.00 I bought it.
0893860220|5|The beauty of this book in particular is it's length and rare psychological insights that come out..The question and answer format employed by many eastern writers not only gives a sense of community of spirit/leading often to man made idol worship ready made for seekers who for whatever reasons are not comfortable with their born traditions, but also hones in on the value of developing a close relationship with your inner somewhat neglected torn turbulent self.<br /><br />The Godly spirit within and without is often stressed and I often read in these pages on the person's need for realization that they are eternal which certainly helps heals one's rift and conflict in the abyss between heart (inner world with it's womblike tendencies) and the mind (outerworld,image creation, desire).<br /><br />Unlike the born free \\"loner\\" Krishnamurti, whose themes of mystical silence between thought and object in order to hear the revealation of G-D leaves one in a state of inactivity and truly alone(as he was), and indeed while it is a truth that healing society requires the urgency for self change and the awareness of the recognition of one's unique conditioning, STILL in my opinion Krishnamurti's remains somewhat utopian in a highly populated cosmopolitan western competitive black and white world dominated by time and acquisition.<br /><br />Maharaj on the other hand goes a step further and stresses the personal quest for deliverance as a happy fatalism to G-D and/or the inner(out is in,in is out)Self.<br /><br />Self acceptance,stress elimination are indeed worthy goals to be actualized.This book offers reassurance without needing to drive you away from society,leave your wife and kids,drop acid, or move to India, nor to abandon your born religion.<br /><br />Life becomes one loving meditation if one works at it and does not allow himself to bleed slowly away. Eliminating suffering and repairing the world's distractions are still worthy pursuits not to be abandoned because all is eternal beyond words.rds. <br />
B009UX2YAC|5|i love love love love love love love love love this game! it is amazing and better than temple run and it is also amazing. did i mention that it is amazing yet?
B00005BKZJ|5|It's my favourite film, so I know what I was buying when I ordered it. It's about Love, welfare, sharing, desert, wonderful images, space, loneliness, problem of imigration, problems between men and women, passion, Art.<br /><br />All is Art in this film, every image could be a painting. The lights and colors are amazing.<br /><br />If you like the desert and if you love USA as I do, this film is a \\"must\\" for you.<br /><br />Yael
B00847TKSE|1|The year was 1988, there were three whales and one died, yes a russian icebreaker did save the whales.<br />However the rest of the film was so annoying and just plain bad that I could not finish watching it.<br /><br />There are 10 minute youtube videos that are better than this piece of garbage.<br /><br />I would not recommend this to anyone that I consider a friend.
B005ZOBNOI|5|LOVED this book!  A beautifully written story!
B00910Y1OQ|4|love these kinds of games. you should try it! you'll definitely like it!  it's relaxing on the mind after working all day.
B001ANSS5K|5|I loved the characters! How diverse each person was from another, and I loved how Margo was so daring! Ahhhh
B005URRCUY|1|This is not rock, it is pretty much the Backstreet Boys with their instruments. This is pop music not rock and by next year they will not even be known. By the way they name the album El Camino and but a mini van on the cover; are they just too stupid to know the difference.
B00006GA4C|5|Great second album. Not quite as good as &quot;on Time&quot;, but very heavy. I highly recommend it.
0061537969|4|Good read!
B000068FXX|5|Another cracker from the briliantly unique Supertramp.  Their work never seems to date and this album is right up there with Breakfast in America.  Timeless stuff.
B0001ARCFA|5|These headphones give and excellent sound, I use them for mixing and they are money well spent, would definitely recommend to anyone looking for nice quality studio headphones
B00AREIAI8|4|nice game. I love horses anyways, so this game is fun to take care of a horse for myself virtually.
B000009HPP|5|Grace is probably my favorite single album.  I bought sketches not really knowing what to expect, and got more than I hoped.  The first CD is all professionally done studio tracks that Jeff recorded with his band in between Grace and his death.  This disc is incredible.  If he had released that alone as his second album it would have easily met the expectations set among his fans by Grace.  'The Sky is a Landfill', 'New Year's Prayer', and 'Morning Theft' are three incredible songs  that come on tracks 1, 7 and 8, and hold this incredible CD together.  The only tracks I'm not as fond of are 9 and 10, but still this is an incredible CD.<br />The second CD is not as impressive at first listen.  It is more tragic.  The different mixes of 'Nightmare by the Sea' and especially of 'New Year's Prayer' that start this off are actually better than the mixes on the first CD.  Then come 7 tracks that Jeff made at home preparing for the studio sessions that were to lead the 'My Sweetheart the Drunk'.  As his mother explains in the liner notes, these are just Jeff at home with his four track.  The sound quality isn't as good, but you can still feel the artistry coming through.  The last track rivals 'Hallelujah' as the best cover ever.  'Satisfied Mind' is a particularly appropriate song to finish off this CD.  Overall, the second disk is not as fun to have in the CD player all the time, but if you listen to both CD's, you can just hear what would have been' Jeff's final version of the album coming together, and it would have been awesome.  Put together some of the best of the first CD with full versions of the stuff on the second, and you would have gotten a CD maybe even more masterful than 'Grace'.  If you like Jeff Buckley, you need this CD before anything else of his but 'Grace'.
B0050DIWFC|4|A book that stirs emotion and makes you reflect on nature or nurture. Just how much do we know about our families?
B002ZG994U|5|I occasionally watched the old series, but wasn't really what you'd call a fan.  But I absolutely LOVED this movie!!!!!  So did my 23-year-old daughter.  I don't care WHAT the critics thought, it was a fun, action-filled, laugh-filled movie.  I do hope that they are planning a sequel.  Treat yourself; buy/rent and watch this.
B00006879E|5|Already being a fan of bands like Dave Matthews Band, Train and REM, I took these guys to heart instantly. It was like looking in a mirror. They dress like me, are energetic like me, but are far more talented than myself. :)<br />Definately a must-have album of the late 03, early 04 season.
0399226907|5|We bought the hardback with the paper cover but quickly found little fingers should have the board book. We used the larger hardback for his first birthday as a guest signature book to leave a little note for Alex. He loves the board book and it is better because the holes are easier to feel and poke little fingers through. And mommy doesn't have to worry about pages or the cover getting torn! :)
B0084AVKZW|4|I always wanted to read Alice in Wonderland and I was not disappointed.  I really enjoyed the magic journey and all the characters who were part of the adventure.  I would certainly recommend it to my daughter and my nieces.
B0086700CM|5|This game is awsome i love it. And i play it every day thanks 4 making this game. bye bye
B008YKGQR4|4|This version of the Facebook app is so much better than the other one I was using.  More features and more user friendly
B00GEEB730|4|very enjoyable
B00PV7HTPQ|1|It would be nice if the Amazon app told me my phone was not compatible before I bought it. Why would they let you buy the app from your phone if it doesn't work on it. Not even a warning or anything.
B0000DIXLM|5|given as gift. they loved it !
B000QRIGLC|5|Excellent book. Hard to put down. Even though I knew the outcome before I started reading it the writers were still able to make me hold out hope that somehow this time would have a better outcome.
B0063GORYU|4|Great app. Pretty basic - Saw other comments about changing suits. Haven't tried that yet. Ads are present but not in ur face the whole time.
B008Y2FRFO|1|found this to be another boring game. glad it was free.<br />deleted it from my kindle in a big hurry.
0525951652|1|I love Ken Follett's books.  I will put my name on the waiting list for this one at the library.  I will only buy ebooks which are reasonably priced.  Maybe the publishers will get the message and not continue in ratcheting up the price of a no overhead product.
B002MQYOFW|5|It was very entertaining, an easy read. It was not what I expected.  Can't wait to read the next book.
B000056VIY|4|I enjoyed this album..It was a bit different than n the 6, but I felt Jennifer was trying to sound a little too much like Destiny's Child on a few tracks. I could tell the big Puff Daddy influence, but it works. Loved the salsa beat..
B00A6PD9I4|2|Weak tea. Don't bother. The storyline is insipid and uninspired and entirely predictable. The characters are pretty standard cliches with little (if any) development during the course of the movie. The music is cloying and generic Lilith Fair derivatives. And it really has very little to do with bravery. The art direction and animation is decent but not really anything that we haven't already seen.
B000HKW7E0|5|A true Chevy Chase classic !
B00U7VDC7A|4|Just started but so far so good.
B00V4JJFN4|4|Probably the best of the three Hobbit movies.  Middle Earth is, once again, a very violent place.  For the number of things killed they shouldn't be able to have another war for 30 or 40 years (dwarfs, people, ogres, and the pointy eared archers, to name a few). Worth seeing for sure.
1938895274|5|Really well written book which gives you the lay of the land. This is a must buy book for everyone being stuck doing the same in the gym for a while and not seeing any noticeable gains
B00486070K|5|Working with the Macbook Air is great, but it can be limiting - there are times when it's just easiest to plug into your network and transfer files. This allows you to connect your USB port into your ethernet network.
B00FAX6XQC|5|I think it is the best  game I have ever downloaded to my kindle. I also think it is the best hunting game for.the kindle fire by far. I would give it a five star review because it is an awesome home.
B001XVCX96|4|Good
B0064MPXFA|5|Great show!
B001ANSSDC|5|Good fast paced read.It kept me interested the entire book. The book is different from the movie so be ready for the changes.

B008PE9GSA|4|excellent
0671449028|5|Cute funny book with all the animals exercising, brushing teeth and getting ready for bed together is quite fun! I really love the pictures!  I have read this book several times to my 3-month old nephew and he is not too interested yet, but I know he will like it when he is older!
B00B0LPYXG|5|Very Good Story line about life, itself in making decision about the truth ...enjoyed the film a lot I would recommend it
B006RZZJ8A|5|If you like sci/fi, this is a good example. Rather than outer space, they explore inner space. The visual effects are really well done especially for when the movie was made. An enjoyable watch.
B004K31GN8|4|im in the usa and found a site wher i could watch all of season 3 in advance its great im going to be getting this for myself when season 3 is released to dvd in the us
B008Y79HE6|1|If it had actually been meant as a parody, I'd have rated it higher, but I don't think they intended that.  It just turned out that way.
B00110K62U|5|As a huge fan of Les Miserables since 1988, I was delighted to be able to inspire my wife to enjoy it as well. She enjoyed this dvd so much, she had to share it with her family. Some of the most talented performers of the musical are included in the concert including Colm Wilkinson who I had the privilege of seeing perfom in L.A. My wife really enjoyed seeing the segment that featured the actors who played Jean Valjean from around the world performing in a montage of a song. We both were thrilled to watch Lea Salonga, a personal favorite of both of ours, perform the role of Eponine. I would highly recommend the dvd to any fans of Les Miserables or any fans of Broadway shows.
B00DR0PDNE|5|I really love this thing!  Totally awesome and I use it regularly.  I do hope the plugin keeps updating on a regular basis.  Basically its a wireless HDMI connection.  Share the screen, watch youtube, movies, all sorts of stuff.
1469984202|5|I've been an avid reader my whole life.  Amazon and Kindle have taken me to the next level.  Searching Amazon for inexpensive fodder for my reading habit, I stumbled across Wool.  Hugh Howey?  Never heard of him.  The title caught my interest, the reviews convinced me to read it and I cannot express how much pleasure I derived from the rarest form of reading - a book you can't put down.  Unfortunately, now I've got a Hugh Howey habit along with my other obsessions.
B008MEM24S|2|Kind of mad I was under the impression that I purchased the FULL game. I then realized that I only had access to level 1
111846446X|4|Good basic book for the RaspBerry Pi.  give lots of details for the Pi and a good book to start.
1878424114|4|A great little book that deserves to belong in everyone's library.  I owned it many years ago and have bought several copies over the years as gifts for friends, but hadn't read it lately until now.  I had forgotten what a treasure it is.  Found a little of it difficult to absorb at first, but after reading it a few times (it's easy to pick up and read a chapter at random), I felt excited about the possible changes I could make in my life.  It's a book that one can refer to again and again.
B001DU8T6S|4|This is quite a good album, debut or not. The songs are diverse and the music is crisp and well-written. My favories are \\"We Believe,\\" \\"Through The Night,\\" \\"Some Things That Glitter,\\" \\"Small\\" and \\"Say It's Not True.\\" Not necessarily in that order. If you liked Queen, you will defintely like this album. If you like Paul Rodgers, you will definitely love this album. But it's got a new sound to it. You can feel and hear the influences from the artists' former collaborations; but you also get this fresh approach to the music that is quite enjoyable. No way are they attempting to copy Freddie here. This is a brand new band that still sings their old songs; but the new songs here are just plain good music that doesn't cheat by relying on the past. I think Freddie would be proud !
B00HDMMISA|4|Typical Moriarty book
B003F9G8B8|4|I had to watch this for my MBA leadership course so I was not expecting something that good but overall it was a decent movie.  A touch long but the content and story were good.  The story is uplifting without being too sugary.  It appears to be a fairly accurate rendering of the events and the acting was well done.  I would recommend as a rental movie as it is not that bad.
B00MNYTWMI|4|Just started, but seems like a lot of fun. TWT
B003P9VZ0W|5|Beautiful addition to our 2 year olds princess room!
B001AKTZO6|5|If you do not know who CCR is then you must be from another planet! I was torn between saving money by buying their entire works collection box set or getting the CD's separately. I decided the Album art work was as important to me as was the music it's self. I was not disappointed and am very happy I went with the individual CD's.
B00BJ9VBLI|2|The game is challenging, I did enjoy.<br />What I think is crazy is you charge $1.99 to move on to another level.<br />In my opinion, all games that charge to continue to play is a rip-off!!
B000002BQK|5|This is Mariah Carey's best album in my opinion. It is her most personal and well rounded album. Who could resist the first single and opening track, &quot;Honey&quot;? It has an infectuous groove and great vocals from Mariah, another #1 hit for her. This album came on the heels of her divorce from Tommy Mottola, so it's very personal and goes deep into matters of the heart. &quot;My All&quot; was another #1, a great emotional ballad. My favorite is the title track, I don't think she's ever written a song more beautiful than this one, and shows an impressive vocal as she transcends over each note, from high to low, almost effortlessly. &quot;The Roof&quot; is a great ballad, with a unique feel to it. &quot;Fourth of July&quot; is a really nice love song, so is &quot;Whenever You Call&quot;. I actually prefer this version over the duet version with Brian McKnight, it's another beautiful song with a great vocal. &quot;Outside&quot; and &quot;Close My Eyes&quot; are very personal, and very relatable. &quot;Breakdown&quot; and &quot;Babydoll&quot; are nice R&amp;B numbers, and she does a nice cover of Prince's &quot;The Beautiful Ones&quot;. Overall this is her best album in my opinion, I don't think she'll ever top it.
1595828753|3|I like the idea that the comic book series is focusing on all the characters not only one. For example in this one, it focuses more on Toph and Sokka.
B005GG0MIS|5|No matter what side of the political aisle your are on you will enjoy this book. To hear how former presidents still stayed in the game was fascinating. How they interacted with each other was enlightening. I never realized how much Richard Nixon stayed informed with what was going on in the world and sharing his thoughts with those who followed after him.
B00D41AJ7G|5|My middle-schooler and high-schooler and I all really like this game!  Trying to figure out how to make the ball look like the sample really can make you use your brain!  Fun!
B004MC8CA2|5|love all the versions of Bibles especially the audio ones! I've recommended this app to many friends and family! A must to have if you enjoy Bible reading!
B00IFMHZ58|5|If you watched the show you will love the movie. They brought back the characters that made the show and makes you want more with the way they ended it.
0345529057|4|I haven't started reading them yet, but the boxed set is great.  I maybe should have rated it higher and would have if I had read it.
B000002H33|5|The heaviest album of all time! Damage Inc sets the bar along side of Master of Puppets. This cd never gets old.
B00009RAJI|5|This is an excellent sounding CD. The remastering is superb. Fleetwood Mac (no doubt the best line up in their long history) at the top of their game. Great song writing, fine playing, and excellent vocals. The Deluxe Edition is just that. DELUXE. Get this, you can't go wrong.
B0054JZC6E|4|I like this app. the only problem is that u have to spend time and unlock each event. but overall it is an okay
B0001IMC8Y|1|dont buy this dvd doesnt seem to play
B00DPM7TIG|5|I enjoyed reading this book over the Christmas holiday.  Loved the flow of words and storyline.  This was not sweet, easy material to read, but thought-provoking.
B002MQYOFW|4|I enjoyed reading the book and want to read the rest of the trilogy but I was disappointed with the ending.
B000UZNRS2|4|Good Baldacci reading as usual.
B009NH6AOQ|5|we are such fans of this series. I am so glad we were able to get this season! it is a must watch!!
B0030MX99O|5|I saw this film in the theater when it came out and then later at home. It's been quite some time since I viewed it, so I rented it from Amazon Prime on impulse. It's still an excellent war film and does a good job of conveying the essentials of the book and the actual operation. Of course, the Germans are portrayed as relatively &#34;good&#34; enemies and the truth was somewhat different and, given the time period in which this was made, a lot of things (shooting prisoners, etc.) were whitewashed. However, the use of actual combat vehicles and aircraft (especially the C-47's) from the period give it a verisimilitude that could probably not be done today, given that most of the ones that are still left are museum pieces that would never be loaned out for a film. I highly recommend it.
B002SJKWZ4|2|problem is not fit for the cable cox commuication and television chanels wand won't work I still dont understand how to use be I trying one order other because wand won't be easer off inside progam I can't explain how to said it
0345803493|5|Loved this book!
B008Y79HE6|4|Movie looks great and sounds great on the devices I watched it on. I'd give the movie itself three stars (it's just okay to me, but that was only when I turned my brain off and just watched the thing), but it gets four stars here for how it played. And again, it looks and sounds good, save a few scenes here and there that look off (but that's the film itself and not the devices).<br /><br />If you're just looking for a movie to kill the time and can overlook the problems with the script, it's a 'fun' action movie with some decent special effects and a good soundtrack.
B008YRVW0I|5|Well worth the price of the game!  Our grandson, age 2, loves filling the tanks, and his grandfather, age 71, loves racking up the money!  It keeps them both busy!  (Lucky me!!!)
B001KVZ6HK|5|I HAVE TO SEE THE HULK IN 3 D I KNOW IT WILL BE GREAT. NOW SOME POPCORN AND THE HULK 3 D. THANK YOU
B00AREIAI8|5|Pretty cool game.. got it for my niece and she loves it.. plays with it all day.. don't get to play or read any books while she comes and visits cause all she wants to do is play with her pretend horsey..
B000000OQF|5|15 years after its debut, this album still ROCKS hard!!  How many other CDs (especially from the 80s) can you say that about.  This album is and always will be a classic!!!<br />Would give it 6 stars if I could.
B000H5V8DG|5|I just finished the entire series a few weeks ago and i gotta say its one of the best shows! It's quite expensive to buy but worth every penny in my opinion! Jennifer Garner is a great actress and really makes this series worthwhile! The series has a great plot that stays with it from the first episode until the last one! Never will this show fail to surprise or excite you to go and watch the next episode! I hope you choose to buy this intriguing and action-packed series. Enjoy it!
0395389496|5|Great book!
B009U9S6FI|5|Totally transformed my life forever.<br /><br />I re-read this book yearly, just to remind myself of my true meaning in life.
B00CEZJT2E|5|I researched a portable power backup device quite a bit and the Anker name definitely received the most praise.  The product is slim and is about the size of a small smartphone.  The included, built-in mini-USB cable is convenient and the additional cable and iPhone plug is great.  Great small device to take while traveling internationally where power is difficult to come by or for those times when you're on the road with battery draining signals.
B005R32L66|5|Awesome sound love them! Would by more if I gave as gift.
B00E9ZATJO|5|Perfect. No problems at all. My boys love it!
B00CUWWLWG|4|It's a great way to pass the time. Great managing game. I love the extra little missions and games you can play.
B00632HWOG|2|It frequently hangs when trying to change folders.  I often have to refresh the screen after moving something from one folder to another, or after forwarding a message.  It sometimes changes the display options I've selected--i.e. I set it up the way I want it, I save the options, I exit Yahoo Mail, the next time I log in, it's changed the display layout to a different format.<br /><br />It used to be rock-solid for me prior to all the changes they made the past several months.  Really gone down-hill since then.
B0090SI56Y|1|It was a bad take on fast and furious Tokyo Drift. Horrendous... I hated every min of it. hated it
B001RTP3Z0|5|i had never heard Leonard Cohen until I caught his Live in London concert on Public Broadcast TV.  I was so intrigued by his sound that I bought the Live in London CD.  Two CD's and 26 beautifully done songs.  Great back up musicians and Leonard's unique vocal makes for great listening.  They are in my car CD changer now and I listen to them over and over.
B001KVZ6HK|5|Its an amazing combo! the packagge its 3D! i played like a child with it before opening the actual box xD<br />The set is nice, the movie looks great! the extras are a few, ill rather more, but enough for many.<br /><br />You recieve a bluray 3d, a bluray, a dvd and a Digital copy. and some surprises inside :D!
B000WZAE1I|5|I saw this movie on TV and fell in love with it.  It has romance, sword fights, good vs evil, not to mention a light comic air with the ghost.  I highly recommend it.  Plus I love the actors.  They do a great job!
0345803485|1|I know this isn't fair, but hubby brought home the trilogy of Fifty Shades the other day which I'd only heard about. I flipped open the first book and tried to read..skipped a few pages more and finally put it back on the shelf. I guess I'll be donating it or maybe selling on Amazon. Is is just me that finds this silly? I guess I should have explored more..I never did find the juicy sex parts that some folks are raving about.
B003IZW4LW|1|I really have enjoyed the whole Stargate franchise, until now. Universe is simply too painful to watch. I do record it and download it from Video on Demand, but I just don't feel the urge to watch it. Perhaps I will someday. But to have the stargate open up into the Battlestar Galactica-ish brand of storytelling says that either the producers no longer have faith in their own abilities or that viewers are too dumb to see the production similarities. Please halt production of this show. I can really use the space on my TiVo for something more entertaining.
B000092ZYX|3|When I bought \\"Hail To The Thief\\",  I expected the songs from the group to be like its hit song 'There, There': light, mellow, but enthralling.  After listening to the whole album, I realized that the emphasis of this album is on light and mellow, and I also realized that I've fallen asleep halfway through the album.<br />I wouldn't say this is a bad thing, it's good to hear an album that doesn't deal with any head-banging moments that I've grew to love in music.  However, the album is very heavy on its light-hearted content.  Never have I heard an album as mellow as this, and it becomes a tiresome experience;  I actually believe I found the perfect cure for insomnia.<br />From the songs I didn't sleep through, I find them to be very good.  '2+2=5', while an incomprehensible song title, starts off slow, but it becomes pulsating and catchy later on.  'When I End and You Begin' is eerie, but it moves me by its atmospheric-related music background.  'Go To Sleep'...strange, all the other songs put me to sleep except this one, which is good, because I find it to be more energetic and upbringing; the same goes for 'A Punchup in a Wedding'.  Finally, 'A Wolf at the Door'.  It's always good to end a album with a bang, and that's what this song has done.  My least favorite song in this album has got to be 'Sit Down. Stand Up'.  Not only is it boring to listen to, but also just as silly.  After hearing \\"The Raindrops\\" from the song constantly for over a minute, it eventually becomes farfetched and laughable.  I can understand there has to be something subliminal about it, but come on!<br />Some people recall to the idea that the vocalist was a whiner, but to be honest, I don't see that in his character. He is a talented, thoughtful vocalist and so were the band.  I understood that they put a lot of effort into making this contemporary industrial album, but effort is not going to be enough if they want to be at the top of the league.<br />Radiohead's \\"Hail To The Thief\\" is a endearing, creative, but not an amazing album.  Radiohead fans are gonna get this, and it's good for them to have this, but for everyone else:  buy this album with caution...and plenty of caffeine.a endearing, creative, but not an amazing album.

B001KDQ4KQ|5|Jodi Picoult is once again able to captivate readers in a way that has them burning through each and every page as if they are being pulled magnetically. Absolutely an amazing novel.
B002VPE1WK|5|Worked perfect!!!!
B0078YWDHO|1|This movie was very terrible.  We turned it off after about 5 min.  We were so disapointed with Johnny Depp.  Please don't spend your money on renting this movvie.
B001UV4XI8|3|The digital copy on this set has expired.  However, at the price it was at as of this writing, its still a better deal than buying the DVD and blu-ray separately, if you want to own both.  This set is the same price right now as the blu-ray alone, so its nice to have the extra dvd to be able to play in my car where we don't have blu-ray.
B00IK7NDIG|5|Cool novella. I'll never look at a turtle in the same way again!
B0086700CM|5|it is super fun! it is easy to play yet challenging enough to be fun :3 and its very very addicting &gt;&hellip;&lt;
B00KX44P22|5|Bought this for a gift.
B00000IPAX|5|This is Blink's best cd yet. I don't think there's one bad song on this whole cd. If u buy it u will NOT be disappointed. Its all 'bout bein a teenager and just partying and having a good time. Every1 should have this  cd cuz its the best cd ever.  I'd like 2 say hi to my buds, especially  Will, Kyle, Scott, Matt, Joey, Joe, Ryan, John Murph., Crandon, Tim, and  every1 I didn't mention, well sorry.  But please buy this cd if u don't  already have it
B0095J0AL6|5|My daughter was very happy to get her ONE DIRECTION album and this was one of the few places with a copy in stock.
B0000VAFO0|1|My sister rented this a few weeks ago telling me I would really like it, (she had seen it before.) She was definatly wrong. When everyone is not killing each other there is a plot that makes hardly any sense. My dad, who usually likes movies like this wasn't able to sit through it.  For the most part it's just a lot of violence with no meaning. I'd never watch it again, and I definatly suggest not to buy it because there are so many other, better, movies out there. Anything is better then this. I really like Kate Beckansile, but I don't know why she would waste her acting abilities in this movie.
B00AALHW6Y|5|Darius at his best
B004J4WKUQ|5|Best book I have read in a long time. So many cool references but not just nostalgic trip; a great story and vision of near future.
B00CH87HF4|5|Fun and easy to start playing. But continues to challenge you through out the game with stronger demons and quests.
B002KECK1G|1|I was very disappointed.  To begin with this DVD stuck 4 times and I had only gone into it 15 mins.  This version is so old fashioned and boring and it looked like something someone made on a budget in an empty warehouse.  It was VERY cheaply made.  They only had about 15 people (if that) acting in the whole movie but I have to admit we didn't watch it after the first 15 minutes.  We were so disappointed.  I made a big mistake buying this copy.   I know what the story is about cause I saw this movie years ago that's why I told my husband it was a MUST SEE for everyone but I must have seen a remade American version cause, even though it was still black and white, it actually had a lot of actors in it making up the group of people they had to live and work with as if an army of brainwashed people.    If you ever want to see 1984 don't buy this version.
B00JVZ0DQG|2|I started out really liking this game...but then came the events...with limited time frames.... I really worked hard to get the German Shepard Dog....but time ran out on me....when I was so close...I am so unhappy with not given the chance to finish and get the Dog...:(<br />Bonnie
B001GQ2TGA|5|This is an awesome CD!  Got one of these for me and gave another as a Christmas gift!
B005OCFGTO|5|I've seen all the movies and wanted to own the set for myself to watch over and over!  The only thing that would have made the set better would be if the movies were individually boxed instead of 8 cds in one box.
B000Y9Q59W|5|Wall Street is a great film about a stockbroker working in New York. Michael Douglas (Gordon Gekko) plays a corporate raider looking to take advantage of the young pro. We get over 2.5 hours of bonus material and a director's commentary here. All of it is quite good but there is no new content. Fox ported over supplements from two previous DVD editions of Wall Street.<br /><br />Video Resolution/Codec: 1080p/AVC MPEG-4   Aspect Ratio: 1.85:1<br />Audio Formats: English DTS-HD MA 5.1, English Dolby Digital 4.0, Spanish Mono, French Mono<br />Subtitles/Captions: English SDH, Spanish<br />Special Features: Audio Commentary (2000), 2 Documentaries (2000; 2007), Deleted Scenes (2007)<br /><br />Buy this film. I rate the film and this product 5 stars. My only complaint is that the video and audio are good but not great. Since Wall Street is a drama it isn't a huge deal. Wall Street has an impressive amount of bonus material for a single disc Blu-Ray (Blade Runner, Pulp Fiction and Apollo 13 also come fully loaded).
0307887448|5|A creative and captivating read for any Gamer or 80s Buff. By far one my favorite books in it's genre!
B007JM4CWY|5|This is a fun game that helps keep your mind active. I like playing this game in my  spare time
B00000DOZB|5|This is a great CD (album). Was not disappointed, as this is perhaps one of their best CDs as far as the upswing/tempo side of \\"Yes\\" goes. Any lover of \\"Yes\\" is likely familiar with this item, although newcomers or late-bloomers to the \\"Yes\\" genre may not be aware of this CD due to low publicization/circulation. I'd say a must buy for your collection.
B00004RE7C|5|The movie is entertaining and enjoyable to watch. I have watched it a few times now and will watch it from time to time again. But then again I grew up watching star trek and I am trek fan.
0060922583|5|I at first was very dubious about reading this book. I study neuroscience, and to think of the brain as a hologram seemed at first insulting to me. But after getting into it, I became more and more fascinated by this idea of a holographic model. Talbot starts off with explaining what a hologram is and how this model can be applied to the brain and the universe. After this, he describes story, after story, after story of amazing supernatural, paranormal happenings all over the world. It seriously blew my mind and actually started me questioning science as we know it. I at first completely refused to accept that any scientific notion was real, according to the findings in this book, but came to realize it's only a lack of scientific development to accept these kinds of experiences that occur. At some point, science is going to go through a serious paradigm shift if it's to incorporate these ideas of how the world really works.     One of the most important messages to take away from this book, is the idea of the implicate and explicate order. The explicate order is what we see in reality, our bodies, the earth, a table, a flower. The implicate order, on the other hand, is the deeper reality, the real source of reality, out of which the explicate arises. This might be a hard concept to grasp at first, but Talbot does a great job in not only explaining this concept but providing a myriad of examples. One thing you should definitely check out after reading this book is the so-called Two Slit Experiment. Go youtube it, it's a 5 minute animation with Dr. Quantum and beautifully depicts one of the concepts Talbot tries to explain in the book.     I won't go into further detail about the book, but one last thing that really left me puzzled was the idea of: We literally create our own reality. And I don't mean figuratively, no, literally. The very existence of a conscious being creates it's own reality. The conscious mind changes the vibrations of reality, is constantly manipulating them. Definitely a book worth reading if you have even the slightest interest in what reality is, what consciousness is, what science is unable to explain and what our minds are truly capable of.
B000I5SY9Q|5|If you have a DVD collection, make sure this film is among them. Truly an epiphany of screenwriting delivered onto the screen by incredibly great actors performing at a level of excellence and even beyond that. Academy Award Winner in 1976 for many reasons. Intelligent and very entertaining back then and even now in 2015.
0783228317|5|I've seen this movie while being bored, touring paris, France. Frankly, I did not want to go to this movie I wanted to go play in an arcade but since Johnny Depp was playing in it ,I had let my friend talk me into seeing the  movie. This movie is probably the most enjoying movie I've seen in ages.  Since then, I saw this movie another eleven times and each time I find new  details I've missed before. You do not have to master the dark world of  narcotics in order to be amused by this film, although I think it might  help (the script mentions stuff I've never heard of in my narcotics class  at med school). Both acteurs captured the essence of being junkies, you'd  laugh just seeing them move. This film does not recomend using drugs, it  just shows the othentic and hilarious life of a junkie. May I add that the  french did not seem to understand the humor, but my friend and I ripped our  bellies laughing for them. In short, this is a warm hearted recomendation.
B005DOKM9M|5|Thanks for this. Worked fine. Fast shipping. Cant go wrong. Thanks again Amazon. Nice and soft for my Kindle. Stylish also. lol
B00I6IKSZ0|5|This best game you can get. So awesome ! I suggest you get asap. Lol.<br /><br />So why u still reading get this awesome GAME . NOW! ; )
B00J2VSS0C|4|it's a bit slow on the Galaxy s4
0740748475|5|Think about it for a moment with me.  I already own every Calvin and Hobbes book that has been published, so I own every one of the strips, some of them in multiples.  So why would I, and many others, slap down nearly $100 for something we already own? Granted, given the weight of this collection, it's still cheaper, per pound then pretty much anything you'll find in the grocery store.<br />Is it perhaps that we felt gypped out of truck loads of Calvin and Hobbes merchendise?  Maybe if Bill Waterson had caved in on his \\"No Merch\\" policy we wouldn't feel the need to buy this.  A couple of coffee mugs and a t-shirt and we would have stayed happy with our paperback copies.<br />Well no that's not it.  The fact is this hefty collection just seems the perfect way to preserve the Calvin and Hobbes legecy.  For most of us who followed the strip through it's decade long run, it took on a deeply cherished place in our lives usually reserved for more formal forms of literature.  This is because Waterson didn't just master the art form, he transcended it.  With the simple tale of a boy and his tiger, he dug deeply into childhood, adulthood, and life in all it's forms, both pleasant and not so much.  He hit all the notes. He didn't just make us laugh; he made us cry, think, and warmed our hearts with something as simple as a watercolor of Calvin and Hobbes walking in the snow.<br />And so yes, I spent my hundred dollars to re-buy a bunch of comic strips that I already own.  And I, like most of the fans out there, was very pleased to do so.
B00ESCJG1U|5|greatly exceeded my expectations. the hdr blend mode creates amazing images from my small 5 mp camera. I've had many compliments on photos I've taken with this software. it really is limitless when it comes to options/tweaks.
B001XVD21Y|4|Nicholson made this movie. Very few actors these days know how to act and Nicholson is one. Hope these new generation actors learned something. Considering this movie was made in 2006, I don't think they learned much
B00475AYJQ|5|really looking forward to Book 3. Just like watching a movie...
0061950726|5|a great novel

B003ODIZL6|2|I think this book was amusing but it is a dictionary so who cares<br />I think if you like to look up words this is the best book for you
B0095ZQ36G|4|The act this book describes is a somewhat minor event in World War II.  But story of the personalities and the insights into the German Air Force in WWII and are what makes this book a great read.
B009UX2YAC|4|I love the game it's a lot like temple run but it should have levels and you need alot of things to get other people
B006X5L6VS|5|Splendid!
B000XUBFE2|5|This was one of the best and most unusual written stories I've come across. With the release of the film, I became intrigued with the book and decided to read it. Having death as the narrator is one of the more clever writing tools I've encountered. The characters will be ones I'll remember for a long time. Will I see the film? I very much doubt it, at least not right away. I want to bask in the beauty of the words that so elegantly cover the pages of this book. Also, since it is supposed to be for young adults, I think it was an interesting plot to educate them about the Holocaust. Excellent book.
B008KOTNVA|5|Definitely the highest quality driver kit I've encountered within a reasonable price range. Bits are high quality, they don't strip if used correctly.<br /><br />The bits are mostly for hand use, if you are going to use these with a power tool anyway, just be careful, and go slow/don't rush it. It might strip the screw otherwise. I've done it, and I'm not complaining since it was my fault.<br /><br />Also be sure to select the correct bit for the job since there are so many variants on the kit. Especially for those phillips type screws and variants, test one size bigger/one size smaller by hand, if you feel it's a better fit then go ahead and use that bit.
0393061310|5|This Pulitzer Prize work is must reading for anyone with any degree of intellectual curiosity.  The author's detailed description of crop evolution tends to be didactic and often borders on being pedantic.  Those whose faith might preclude the reading of such a work could even use it to make a case for intelligent design.
B004YRBULS|5|Great classic
0062127241|5|I just finished this delightfully insightful, humorous memoir: terribly tragic at times, filled with revealing, shocking, heartwarming and comical anecdotes about my rock-'n'-roll heroes and periods of my youth--straight up to today; a story which evidently took a great deal of soul-searching by the author to present his tale in a forthright, honest manner that makes me feel like I have personally known Pete Townshend from day one. Kudos to a master musician and fine artist, a musical Renaissance man, and a great inspiration to our generations past and present for a fantastic, fascinating book, highly recommended in my most humble opinion.
B0054JZC6E|5|I love this game!!! But I HATE 'Hyperspace'... as well as 'Aquarium '. Other than that, I love this game!
B006S08RLU|5|This was such a great movie. I found myself quickly drawn into it from the start.  It was recommended by a friend and now I recommend that others watch it as well
0440241413|2|Although the book has some amusing parts, the biggest part of it is Rebecca \\"Becky\\" Bloomwood shopping and getting into tremendous debt.  She works for a magazine writing on finance but spends more of her time (and thoughts) on shopping or where people got their things.    The story is not particularly \\"romantic\\" or even that funny.  If you know a lot about haute couture name brands (British in this book, American in the sequel), you can follow her thoughts and shopping fairly well but quickly tire of her excuses and ignoring of her debt (to the point of making up a stalker to avoid her bank manager).    But of course, being chick lit, it all works out in the end and she's off for another adventure (pretty much more of the same) in Shopaholic Takes Manhattan.    Get it if you really need something to read but if you want good chick lit, check out the Plum series for American or Bridget Jones's Diary for British.
0525951113|5|Great book, couldn't put it down. Going to go get the second one that was released recently.
B000FC1K66|5|It was a very surprising book to read.  The ending almost made me cry.
0307460444|4|I think it's a good book for decorating ideas. Good for inspiration.  Cupcake recipients liked the ladybug and golf cupcakes so far.<br /><br />With all the different opinions about the recipes, I'm not sure I'll try the recipes or not.  I saw a similar recipe to one in the book on her website, and the website one looked better.<br /><br />I'm guessing she didn't test the recipes, but just lent her name to the book.  I bought a used copy, probably wouldn't have paid full price for a new one.
B00A9ET4MC|5|One of my favorite books. A well written, thoughtful read showing a different perspective of American culture.
B00IMZ2PNK|5|Enjoyed this movie. Great thriller. Leaves you on the edge. Would watch this again in the future,  hopefully on demand.
B0044KU7EQ|5|Wow!! Much more than we expected when ordering. Bought 2 sets, one for ourselves and one for x-mas gift for our grandson--think he is going to love it!!
B00DR0PDNE|5|We ordered this hooked it up with no problem we sync our tablets and it works fine we have to play with it to see what we really have
B00CWY76CC|4|fun game just the perfect amount of challange. i just wish there were more levels. I can not  wait for the update.
0439023521|3|I am still digesting it. The opening pages were so familiar that I couldn't get over the feeling I've read them before. Which was bizarre since I'm positive I haven't. Anyway, as I moved along I got caught up in the story. I did enjoy it very much until right at the end. After the games I felt it became very rushed as if it was a sudden need to get to the next book. Maybe it was intentional to show the head spinning drop back into the real world for the main characters. It did leave me feeling a little dissatisfied and I'm glad I have the next book here to move on to straight away. I think if I had to wait for the next installment I wouldn't have kept reading.
B000003TA4|3|Yes, I said it, I hate Nirvana.  However, Smells Like Teen Spirit is among my favorite songs of all time, as my redemption comment lol.  Before the fire and lava start pouring out of your ears, let me explain why I dislike them.  First I'm going to start off by fueling the fire and saying I think Kurt Cobain is among the worst songwriters in history because most, if not all, the songs were written while he was on drugs or drunk.  That to me does not make you a good writer.  It just means you can produce crappy noise for people who have no idea what music is.  He was a decent guitar player but even still sucked at it.  The SOLE reason for three stars was for the influence this CD had on pop-culture.  I would never ever own this, I'd get the few songs I like and call it good.  Nirvana was unquestionably one of the most influential bands in rock history according to our society, but to me that doesn't say much.  Black Sabbath, Cannibal Corpse, Johnny Cash, Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, Aerosmith, Slayer, and maybe Metallica were REAL rock and metal icons.  Nirvana brought grunge and alternative rock to the forefront but didn't really influence metal or heavy rock much.  They were just the Black Sabbath of the alternative scene, not rock in general.  I know everyone wants to stab my eyes repeatedly with a dull rusty butter knife right now, but hey, it's just how I feel.  Would I recommend this album?  Only to a collector, but not to rock or metal fans.
B004RFYEEC|5|Being a fan for more than 20 years, I remember hearing the bootleg smille sessions and tracks.  They were incomplete, but the best of what was available at that time.  Now, when Wilson in 2004 released his and his band's interpretation of SMILE, though I knew it was re-recorded, it still gave me the first defined compilation we all had been waiting for.  This new box set, is not meant to be that - I appreciate it's raw tracks and quality.  I will enjoy the tracks and see what thhe foundation of SMILE was intended to be.  However, if one wants to hear a finished product - you gotta Brian's solo release of SMILE.
B00DL48BM6|5|Was shipped fast and worked wonderfully
B007J4T2G8|5|Maybe I'm too liberal but there wasn't much that shocked me when it came to the &#34;adult&#34; parts. A great book with some catch lines that are for sure to stick around. It's a great book to read and escape the world for a while.
B005K0HDGE|5|There is one sign that tells me just how good a book is: can I, and will I, sit and read a book until I finish, get bored, or pass out from exhaustion. As of about a month ago, the  best book I have read, by those standards, is The Hunger Games. I read all three novels in one sitting. However, this book has made the list. I started reading at about 8:00, and passed out around 3:00, 750 or so pages in. While some of his books are pretty bad, books like these are what makes me agree  with many of his fans that he is the geatest novelist of all time. This book, like many of his others, take an overly cliched idea an turns it into something amazing. What I love about him most is that he takes all the nitty gritty details tht you love to hate and makes them almost fun. The cameos from past( and most likely future) novels were fun, and the story a great one. My only complaint: the aftermeth of the shooting sucked. I mean,I just read 1100 freaking pages of the past, I kind of wast to read the thing tht actually made me want to read this book: the aftermth. I'm just saying, at least 100-150 pages on life withot the asassination. other than that, it was amazetastic.
B00104W8T6|5|This is a fantastic compiliation for a fantastic movie! The songs are quirky but they're enjoyable! You seriously have no idea what you're missing out on if you don't buy this!!!
B00GQ051NY|3|I don't want to spoil it for fans that are really into the show like I was so I won't say too much. I think most of the people that watch the show like Dexter's character. I think the person that wrote the end of the show had ill feeling towards Dexter.
B00KY7PEAA|5|Nice game<br /> Great stuff 5/5
B008Z9YLV2|4|When I took my girlfriend to see this movie, she left saying it was &#34;a massive game of hide and seek, only with everyone dying, so more like seek and destroy.&#34; I laughed, and moved on. Fast forward to the dvd release, and I decided to give the movie another chance. Having read the books by now, I watched again, and decided they actually did a great job making this book into a movie.
B00I6IKSZ0|5|Awesome game but a few things you should put.number1. a couple free guns .and unlimited ammo friend code so it can be easy to find friends .one last thing daily reward likes 80 coins a day .please update it like this pleasure thank you
B00026WU3M|5|If I had to come up with a list of my top 5 favorite Bob Dylan albums &#34;Oh Mercy&#34; would be on it. This album represents some of the very best work Dylan has done in his long career. Released in 1989 there are many who claim this album was a come back after the albums that Dylan would release during the '80s. Many of Dylan's fans didn't care too much for the music he was putting out during that decade. That to me doesn't make sense. Yes maybe it wasn't the best period of work for him. One of my least favorite albums from that decade would be &#34;Knocked Out Loaded&#34; yet that record did produce &#34;Brownsville Girl&#34; one of his best songs. Another album, &#34;Down In The Groove&#34; is looked down by many fans although while not one of his best I still think was a very good recording. But really that decade also saw Dylan make records like &#34;Infidels&#34; and &#34;Empire Burlesque&#34; which are outstanding in their own right. To me &#34;Oh Mercy&#34; is certainly the best album from that time but not a come back album.<br /><br />The major reason why &#34;Oh Mercy&#34; is so good is because of its producer Daniel Lanois. 8 years later Lanoius and Dylan would team up once again and make the Grammy award winning &#34;Time Out Of Mind&#34; album. A great effort on their part to be sure but I always thought &#34;Oh Mercy&#34; was the better of these two albums. The production of this record is great. The sound and feel to &#34;Oh Mercy&#34; seems natural. Dylan is in fine voice that really shines in some of the slower songs like &#34;Where Teardrops Fall&#34;, &#34;Shooting Star&#34; and &#34;Ring Them Bells&#34;. In a way as well this album reminds me back to Dylan's earlier career when his songs had a more political mood with songs like &#34;Political World&#34;, &#34;Everything is Broken&#34; and &#34;Disease of Conceit&#34;. In every case however the production and engineering of these songs is outstanding.<br /><br />For the serious Dylan fan this is a must to include in your music collection. The same would be true for the more casual fan. I would suggest to those not familiar with Dylan this can make a good introduction to his music but don't just limit yourself to just this one album. There were many excellent albums made by Bob during the '60s, '70s and yes even the '80s as well as into the 21st century I think you will like. I certainly recommend &#34;Oh Mercy&#34; to get however!de in your music collection. The same would be true for the more casual fan. I would suggest to those not familiar with Dylan this can make a good introduction to his music but don't just limit yourself to just this one album. There were many excellent albums made by Bob during the '60s, '70s and yes even the '80s as well as into the 21st century I think you will like. I certainly recommend &#34;Oh Mercy&#34; to get however!
B008XG1X18|5|Pinterest is my go to for new ideas.
B006GWO5NE|4|It was sufficiently packaged and arrived on time.  I love that it is an original cable.  It appears to work just fine
B00BF11STU|4|A little slow at times but overall entertaining. Very intriguing to see all that went on leading up to the final event.
B005LAIIKI|4|this was a good movie i did like it. the western music added in made me think of the old westerns so that was nice but the rap music for me takes one star off. so 4 it is this year i have watched over 100 movies and this is in the top 15 movies for this year.
B005ZOBNOI|5|It's a tear jerker. Anyone who has been sick can relate. Makes you think twice about petty complaints in life.
B00003CXRP|4|It was a good movie, but there are tiny flaws that can be overlooked by Tom Hanks performance.  I do agree with the Oscar for Best Actor Going to Russell Crowe, but that doesn't take away from the brilliant performance of Tom Hanks.
B005HEVIJQ|5|The episodes this season have mostly been pretty interesting and engaging.  Definitely good for the series to end on a higher note.
B003ZMF26W|4|This mouse is so smooth and responsive but you have to know how to write scripts.The CM Storm Inferno has quickly adjustable DPI buttons. On the technical side it still is the best mouse I owned. I just use it regular mouse except for changing DPI and I will get the rapid fire mapped. It exceeds all my functions. CM Storm have quite a extensive line of mice and products.
B001UV4XHY|5|Somehow I missed this chapter of the Harry Potter series while I was abroad.  I tried to buy it at many local venues with no success.  Then I remembered Amazon and purchased it there.  The quality of the DVD was excellent.  You can always be certain that you're getting the very best with Amazon.
B0010SKTRA|4|This book has a very entertaining and detailed explanation of evolution as a reference guide for anyone in a biology course or just interested in evolution.
1401308201|1|The delivery took over two weeks and when it did arrive the entire binding was torn. I ordered the book as \\"new\\" so there was no reason for it to be in such terrible shape. Very disappointing since I wanted to give the book as a gift. Would never order anything from here again.
B00ISJT5IS|5|Awesome, Inspiring, the scenery is magical, and Ben Stiller is a completely different character than he usually plays. This has become one of my favorite movies.
B00000IBRX|5|This Emotional, Breathtaking drama has got to be the biggest tear jerker(in a happy way) out there.  You thought you cried hard on &quot;Titanic?&quot;, &quot;Armageddon?&quot;, or &quot;Ol' Yeller?&quot;   This one will definiteley send you reaching for your Kleenex!  The way they  set the story line up was great.  To sum it up without giving away the  movie, It's about a guy who's married and has 2 children that die in an  auto accident.  A few years later, he himself (Robin Williams) dies.  He  tries to find his children in heaven and later gets word that his wife  commits suicide because of all the stress.  For that, she does not go to  heaven and Robbin Williams goes to hell to find his wife.       Good sound  quality, good picture, 2 thumbs up!  one of Robbin Williams' best  performances.
B005IQZB14|2|I'm only writing this review to WARN YOU that you may want to skip the bloody shooting of a beloved horse that goes from bad to worse; you will know it when you get to these pages so you will have time to skip it if desired.  I was upset when I read this portion of the story & could only hope there was a good reason for it to be included but... I did not get any meaning out of that section or actually any part of the story which surprised me given the great reviews & I usually love reading about peoples' experiences.<br /><br />I gave the book 2 stars for the mildly entertaining stories about the people she met along the trail, because it was an easy read, & because it sounded fairly honest.  I found the story emotionally unsatisfying.  I didn't care for the author & was unmoved by her words.  She seemed as open & honest as possible looking back into her youth.  The experience she described sounded fairly typical for a person in their twenties who was self-absorbed with little depth especially in the last half of the book.<br /><br />The author may have been transformed but it was not clear as to how - it probably would not have mattered much ultimately to understand this if there was something compelling somewhere else in the story.  Remember that this book is truly an unsentimental memoir that has little to do with hiking the PCT.  If that sounds good to you, go for it.  If you are finding you are not enjoying it, it does not get better in my opinion.  My friend read this & liked it, so it is truly personal preference.
B00AGH6FD8|5|Great sequel! Not as good as the first but fun none the less.
B0001I562I|5|We got this for our daughter as she loved this growing up and wanted to rent it, but could not find it
B0011E9LBI|4|I thought it was a funny, exciting movie.  Quite a bit of memorable lines.  The reason I gave it only 4 stars is I thought that there was a lot of unnecessary swearing.
B000GOU4M4|5|Best Christmas movie there is!!
B000UX6THK|5|It's great to see that both seasons and the pilot are finally in one package. \\"Twin Peaks\\" was a fantastic show that was quite experimental for its time (1990-1991) that at it's worst was better than most everything else on TV. I wish the show could have survived longer, but with an awful second season time slot - Saturday at 10pm - it had no chance. The revelation of Laura Palmer's killer took the wind out of the sails somewhat just nine shows into the second season, but the true theme of Twin Peaks was about the evil in the woods that took the form of the killer and the seamy underbelly of what appeared to be everyday small-town life. The murder of Laura Palmer was just the surface of that. Three somewhat pointless episodes followed the one that revealed Laura's killer, but then the show bounced back with the Windham Earle storyline. Unfortunately many viewers had stopped watching the show by then. Perhaps the lasting legacy of \\"Twin Peaks\\" is that it made series with weird subplots, long story arcs, and oddball characters more acceptable to the networks. For example, I don't think that \\"The X-Files\\" could have made it to the air in 1993 had it not been for \\"Twin Peaks\\" preceding it and succeeding. After all, after a show where there is a dwarf that materializes on a bed, dances, and talks backwards, an alternate reality where clones are created and sent out to the world, and creamed corn as a symbol of suffering, the adventures of Scully and Mulder look as thematically tame as Dragnet.<br /><br />As for the extra features of each disc, that will probably eventually appear in the product description.

0991379659|4|These books were great. I really liked the stories. I hope there more to come. I will buy them too. I love these kinds of books. I paid more money not like 99¢ but the money doesn't brother me.
B0008KLVG4|5|I would like echo all the complaints that people have stated about this edition of the DVD. If you already have a previous edition of it, then you are fine with the one that you have. But if you do not have \\"Jaws\\" already on DVD, then you are in for a real treat.  This edition features some excellent bonus features, including a two hour long documentary on the making of the movie, as well as a nicely put together scrapbook of pictures and quotes from the cast and crew. But, let's be honest, you could put out \\"Jaws\\" as a bare bones DVD and it would still be mandatory.  And that's because after thirty plus years the film still manages to have the same visceral reaction as it did upon it's release. It's still a scary, taut, perfectly pieced together thriller. And on this DVD it looks as sharp and crisp as it ever has, and the soundtrack is well mixed and put together.  So, if for some reason, you do not own \\"Jaws\\", this is a must purchase for you, because films rarely get better than this.
B0000AK7AB|5|My granddaughter loves to watch Babel before she goes to bed. It's soothing yo hear the calm voices of the characters.

B00DJWV11I|5|Drew and Kate what can I say about them, they make a great team. Drew is her mentor. Drew and Kate have to team up a presentation for a big client. They spend weeks together bringing both their ideas together. During one frustrating night at the office all Drew's pent up angst for Kate changes the way they feel about each other. Drew has admitted to Kate on several occasions that he is attracted to her, but he tries to always keep it professional with her. However, he is weak when it comes to Kate and he can no longer control himself when around her.<br /><br />The story is funny and told from Drew's perspective. I love how he talks about himself in the third person. The writing style is amazing. I have been wanting to read this story for awhile and was super stoked when the price dropped down to $2.99. I could not resist.  I knew it was going to be a great story because I read a sample of it and was hooked. It is funny, witty, clever, and very entertaining. I love how Emma talks about guys and warns women about guys. I love when a player falls in love and has to work hard to prove he is worthy. What woman would not swoon over a man going crazing with want for a woman he can't have, it's poetic and sweet revenge for all the times they use woman to relieve that pent up physical energy. Karma is a bitch and some women are blessed with the power to bring players to their knees.<br />I love the way Drew talks to the reader like I'm standing next to him watching. I've never read a story like this where I literally feel apart of the story.<br />The analogies Emma uses are freaking hilarious and so true.<br />Reading about the the different ways Drew can prove his love for Kate was priceless. Literally, Drew spent a fortune proving his love to Kate. Really all he needed was a sweet niece to knock her socks off. You rock Emma. That was the most entertaining player romance I have ever read. Your name is going to be one I blurt out to others when recommending funny romance stories.ories.
B00BSBR9N6|5|SPOILER ALERT!!! There are no words to adequately describe this phenomenal book. I am an avid book reader with a special love of romance novels! This is by far the best written, most thoroughly researched romance novel that I have ever read. The character of Don is very endearing with his social idiosyncrasies. The true genius of the book is how the author gets inside of Don's head so that any reader can understand how someone with Asperger's syndrome can find love and thrive. This is an absolute must read!
0393312836|5|This is a book I had to buy 3 times before my mom stopped throwing it away, and she threw away the DVD I bought of it too. It's trash, she said. I thought it was a good commentary on what's wrong and what's right with the world. I read the book in school, because I _wanted_ my teachers to see I was reading it, because I wanted to wear my mind on my sleeve to some extent, by showing them a book that meant something to me.<br />Much to my surprise and chagrin, they did not respond as my mother did. In fact, they would ask me why I found it engaging (and believe me, I did), and they would talk to me about the characters and the story. It was a book that made me re-evaluate a lot of things in my world, and to a large degree, it helped me (indirectly) gain some valuable insight into myself and the people around me.<br />To say this book didn't change my life would be a lie. In fact, I'm sure this book changed in one way or another the life of everyone who's read it. Lately, in America especially, people will hide behind the veil of decency and what's right and good to repress and take away freedom. ACWO indeed gives a deep insight into this sort of action, and the deadly and terrible consequences it may have.<br />It dares to ask the question of if good is good because of intentions or because of instinct. In a more direct way of saying it, it says &quot;does society act civil because it wants to or because it is somehow forced to by an influence other than its own&quot;.<br />Like &quot;Mother Night&quot; by Vonnegut, this book points out that the individual, no matter how much you might not like them, or how much you might not believe who they really are, is defined by their actions and their words, and that the world around them forces who they appear to be onto them, or forces its views of who they are onto them.
0780626494|5|Great family flick I've bought twice since its release. A one of a kind I'm glad to have again today.
B006GLLXXK|4|Its different with a little bit redneck and craziness fun to watch. I gave it four stars because its different
B00VF3YXUY|5|Some of James' most heartfelt music to date. Saw him in concert in Fenway and enjoyed these new songs nearly as much as our life long favorites.
B008MEM24S|5|where's my perry is just like where's my water but better. where's my perry is better because I get to play as perry who os my third favorite Phineas and Ferb character. I think you will find this addictive and fun.
0670024783|3|This is a history of slavery and feminism during the Abolition period.  It was interesting to me as a history book.  Not so much as a novel.  I think it was too long and wordy for my taste and some of the issues in Sarah's life could have been told in a shorter manner. When I noticed that it was one of Oprah's picks, I should have known.  Anything Oprah likes, I usually don't.  Love Oprah but not her taste in reading.
B00080ZG10|5|I at least hope not.  All of the reviews are very good on here, but I have to be honest, this is one of my top 10 favorite movies of all-time.  I have never been a leonardo fan, until now.  I will be reviewing the 2-disc edition here.<br /><br />The movie itself is wonderful in showing us a GOOD version of the howard hughes story.  the commentary does a lot of explaining hwo you can't tell a 100% true life story of a this guy, so they took facts and built on that to make this movie.  They go over many historical events and seem to hit many of the good ones.  But leonardo's portrayal is magnificent.  Not only is he perfect for the young free spending howard, but also for the older role.  There is a wonderful part in the movie that is showing you just how crazy this guy is.  He sees a dirty janitor cleaning, howard asks somebody if that guy works for him, he tells the guy to fire him.  I thought it was a great part, but the commentary gives you great insight of how he was supposed to be seeing himself years from now all dirty and stuff.  It doesn't make the movie any better, but it is always good to have an understanding.  So it would take to long to go over this long ass movie, but it is awesome and I have to say that the court scene is definitely one of my favorite scenes in cinema history.<br /><br />The commentary is pretty good, btu not enough talking, not coherent enough, and A LOT of repeated stuff from the interviews.<br /><br />And all of the interviews and documentaries are well worth watching.  There is also a lot of stuff on the miniatures and how they got the action scenes to screen.  Also costume and music featurettes.  Overall the extras get a 4/5, it's just I can't rate the extras anywhere near the actual movie, it is truly inspiring.
B003F3NDP8|5|This season was really good, especially at the start! The seasons starts with answers and the frist episode ends on a dark note! Drea de Matteo was fantastic in this season as a housewife from New York with her own secret! The season finale was pretty good and ended on a good note for some and left you waiting for next season!
B00CH26TL8|4|I've played this game on my PC so I got it for my Kindle Fire.  It works well, but I only gave it 4 stars as I don't care how you have to direct the bubble marble where you want to shoot it.  It's very touchy and too slippery on the kindle fire.  But overall, it's a fun game.
B00006SFBD|5|Well folks, its Opeth, isn't it?  So of course it is the absolute best death metal money can buy.  This is definitely Opeth's heaviest work, with a bigger influence placed on heavy roaring electric guitar chords.  As such, this cd is best if thrown into your cd changer with Damnation. These songs all exhibit the usual Opeth brilliance.  Incredibly heavy but very melodic at the same time, Opeth should be required listening for all of humanity.  While this cd isn't quite as good as Blackwater Park or Still Life (what could be?) if your a fan of Opeth you will still love every minute of this disc.  Get it, you won't be disappointed.  Another interesting thing I've noticed about heavy Opeth cd's like this is that they turn rap fans into little puddles of human effluence, which means it does double-duty for humanity...
B00003CXCS|5|This is JUST the type of musical the entire family can enjoy. I was really really little when I first saw it, and I have loved it ever since. It has everything a movie/musical needs : an exciting plot, romance, suspense,  danger, humour, sad moments, happy moments, not to mention a splendid  Rodgers and Hammersteins score. It is probably the most memorable musical  ever. Julie Andrews was born to play Maria, and Christopher Plummer did a  superb job portraying the self-righteous Captain Von Trapp, so  good-looking,  so manly. My favourite character is the proud, heartless,  jealous baroness who was portrayed so 'exquisitely' by Eleanor Parker. And  last but by no means the least, the children who were splendid, not to  mention Liesel's lover : Rolfe. My fav. songs are MARIA, SIXTEEN GOING ON  SEVENTEEN &amp; CLIMB EV'RY MOUNTAIN. However, I like MY FAIR LADY &amp;  THE KING AND I more than this, yet I still feel that this was Rodgers and  Hammertsein's greatest triumph. The songs are much nicer in THE KING AND I,  and I prefer Marni Nixon's singing voice to Julie Andrews' for teh simple  reason that it's more 'sweet' and 'smoothe'. I think Marni Nixon plays the  role of Sister Sophia, which reminds me, the Nuns were my other set of fav.  characters, as they are 'typical' nuns. As THE KING AND I and THE SOUND OF  MUSIC are Rodgers and Hammerstein's greatest hits, there's a Julie Andrews  vs Deborah Kerr, Christopher Plummer vs Yul Brynner saga. In any case, THE  KING AND I is more touching than THE SOUND OF MUSIC, and I liked the subtle  Anna/The King romance better than the the Maria/Captain Von Trapp romance.  However, THE SOUND OF MUSIC is rather simmilar to THE KING AND I in many  ways. For instance, THE KING AND I itself is based on a British Governess  who travels to Siam in order to tutor the King of Siam's children, the same  way Maria leaves the Abbes in order to be governess to Captain Von Trapp's  children. Then the conversation between Maria/The House-keeper is rather  like the conversation between Anna/Lady Thiang. The secret love affair of  Liesel/Rolfe is simmilar to Tuptim and Lun Tha's love affair, and Captain  Von Trapp himself is much rather like the self-righetous, arrogant King of  Siam. In addition, the Lonely Goatherd is much rather like the famous  'Small House of Uncle Thomas - Ballet' from THE KING AND I. Plus, Mother  Abbess's advising song CLIMB EV'RY MOUNTAIN resembles Lady Thiang's  SOMETHING WONDERFUL in which she counsels Anna on the King. However, as  much as I like THE KING AND I more than THE SOUND OF MUSIC, it is better  developed than KING AND I, and it will always remain everybody's favourite  family musical, and I'd much rather see THIS than TITANIC any day. The most  important message you can learn from this is that God's Will always leads  one to joy, content and happiness, no matter how difficult and impossible  it may seem as first. The other reviewers are right. On a scale from one to  ten, this musical deserves ELEVEN stars...
B00BHHIWQO|3|With only 60 seconds to play each game, the time passes quickly.  The ticking clock is a little annoying and it would be better if there were some other options on playing the game.
B0058VW36U|3|I bought the app for the kids.  I do not use it but they seemed to like it.  I think they may have stopped using it.
B006MW3UZW|5|Downton Abbey is an excellent series, a night-time melodrama for those who take delight in historical glimpses into changes in 20th Century English society.  It focuses not only on the aristocratic family who owns the Downton Abbey residence, and who perceive their personal fortunes changing because of the aristocratic traditions in the transference of property through the male line.  Thus, in a family of only girls, the family's future is secured through appropriate marriage of the eldest daughter to a cousin.  But the drama also includes the changes and intrigues of the loyal serving class, which is punctuated, by the &#34;revolutionary changes&#34; brought about by war and the transformation of society through industrialization and new money.  It is a well-acted, well-constructed, well-produced series which continues to appeal to broad audiences.
B000000WI4|3|Not my favorite &#34;HOOK&#34; but good enough---but the jacket cover is worth whatever price is being charged to a collector like me
B008Y78GYI|4|This is one of my favorite movies and I enjoyed watching it again.  In my memory it was a five star movie--Great  music, great Barbara Streisand, great cast, and visually striking.  I still love it, but not as much.  Barbara Streisand is still perfect; the music, wonderful; the cast, for the most part familiar but not household names, almost perfect.  I forgot how jarring and wrong Omar Sharif was for Nicky Arnstein.  While beautiful to look at and very classy, he's not an Arnstein in any sense and, worse, can't sing.  I also have to admit that theater has changed in the last half century and what was fresh in the 70s can at times seem overdone.    With all of that, still one of the best and worth watching.
030746363X|4|Fairly decent read
B003K16PFU|5|Excellent first person insight into the Spanish Civil war.
B0050DIWFC|4|I thought it was slow moving at times but the ending made up for that! I didn't expect it!
B0023P7ZF8|4|....two 180-gram vinyl discs, a nice fold-out poster of the band and a cool laser etching of the H & H logo with additional design on side 4 of the LPset (the music takes up only three sides).  I found the sound quality to be better than the CD.
B005I3PAUO|4|Well written in an extremely terse, staccato style. Lots of twists and turns. Only a formulaic ending keeps me from awarding five stars.
B00DR0PDNE|5|What a small unassuming device with big rewards. Worked so well with Netflix! I am not a tech wizzard so this was so easy to figure out-it was a pleasure.
B00N1HONIO|5|Definitely worth it creepy and scary headphones full blast!!!
B00D6BQPMM|2|was tempted to buy it, thought renting would be better, turns out its not like other zombie movies. rent first
B0013TXA5Y|4|I really enjoyed this book. I read it awhile ago and going to start up on the 2nd in this series. I have really enjoyed a lot of YA reads lately and this series I know will join in with my other favorites. There's action, twists, confusion. Some reviews I read didn't enjoy this read. I disagree! I am in my late 30's and loved it. Remember it's a YA read. Enjoy.
B000KX0IOA|5|Kudos to film makers who go to great lengths to cast an actor who more than just resembles the person being depicted. With Ben Kinglsey playing the role, they couldn't have done a better job: he IS Gandhi!
B008J34466|5|I love Pink. As an artist. a songwriter, as a woman who tells it as it is. This album is funny, witty, sharp and Pink to the core.
B000XUBFE2|5|This book, narrated by Death, follows a young girl during WWII -- from tragic loss to happiness to tragic loss, the girl learns the power of words. As a book lover myself, I really enjoyed the concept/plot. Character development is excellent throughout. I had a little bit of trouble at first figuring out who our narrator was, but think that perspective only made the book better.
B0054JZC6E|5|this game is great!!! can never stop playing it. I love all the games. id regamend people ah love different gamesvto download it!
B00DS5YUV4|5|Excellent app to automate almost everything on your phone.
B004GJDQT8|5|I love Amazon I can usually find everything I need right here.
B0097HSS4M|1|You can't even apply text correctly, nor does it allow you to use different fonts. Don't waste your money!
B0094BB4TW|1|Since the newest update I can't watch videos and it keeps crashing. I want to go back to the version before this update.
B00BVYNSLC|5|This show is totally amazing!!
B004EPZ0AC|5|it was awesome
B00A83075M|5|Wreck-It Ralph is great for those who are nostalgic and have played the classic video games like Q-Bert and Pac-Man!  Also, the plot includes being left out and trying to gain the admiration of your peers in a very concrete way, by winning a medal in a game.  It entertained my middle school boy multiple times.
B0054R6BFM|5|I think this book should be required reading for Middle School and High School students. It may make these young people think twice about how they treat others.  It was very well written.
0143037757|5|I'm only adding a review to give the book 5 stars. The books is excellent and worthy of most people's attention. Other reviews explain why much better than I could.
1935597760|5|If you're Irish and love it's culture and history, good and bad, this book is for you. If you love a well written book that is also a great read this is for you. The Misremembered Man is a book to remember and pass along to friends and family!!!
6304366078|5|If you are looking for the greatest of plots, this is not the movie for you.  However, if you are looking for the best racing footage ever shot, then this movie will definitely let you know what it feels like to be a  Formula 1 driver.  <br />The cinematography is fantastic and the locales in  Europe are beautiful.  The opening scene in Monaco alone would be worth the  cost of the movie.<br />If only Days of Thunder could have been half as good  as Grand Prix!
B00BAXFJ5M|3|I should preface that I read The Hit before this book, and it was so much better.  King and Maxwell was a bit of a struggle to get through.  I've never left a book unfinished, but I was tempted to quit on this book numerous times.  I wish I had borrowed this from the library instead of purchasing it.  I have enjoyed other books by this author, but King and Maxwell fell flat.  Maybe, he has stretched these characters out too much.  Are they a couple?  I don't even care anymore.  I think this is the third novel that I have read with these main characters.  The storyline and resolution could have been much better.  I will be a little leery of Baldacci after this one.
B0094BB4TW|5|It allows me to stay in touch with my friends and family. having it on my Kindle Fire tablet is wonderful. I would recommend it to a friend.
B000002GQE|4|Perhaps the symphonic numbers are too long at the beginning, and maybe thelunch break song really S-U-C-K-S and maybe the evening songs aren't so memorable, &quot;Tuesday Afternoon&quot; and &quot;NIWS&quot; make it all  worthwhile.
B000QCQ8Y4|4|Another great Reacher book
B00F2362IE|2|It's okay.
B005GFPZYK|5|Great insight into our soldiers' trials, tribulations and successes.  People like Chris are what makes America great.
B003LZ5B7S|5|This TV show, is simply... amazing! Its funny! Its cool... its interesting... Now, I am going to stop blabbering,<br /><br />Quality:<br />The acting, though slightly unnatural at times, is actually suprisingly good for a TV show. Also, TV shows usually are low budget and seem to be poor on the effects, and costumes, and such, but this show hasn't really dissapointed me. Anohter note, I just started to watch the show, and I got so addicted, I watched the full season in three days!<br />For me, the worst thing was the change of actors... or was it? I was soooooooooo dissappointed when I found out that there would be different actors, but let me tell you... I just watched the first episode of the second season, and let me tell you, it's GREAT! It has a slightly different feel, but I think that they improved on it...<br /><br />Humor:<br />Just a quick note, if you are still doubting whether or not to buy the epsiodes... (GET PRIME, AND WATCH THEM ALL FOR FREE) but still, this is a must see.<br /><br />Plot:<br />Sometimes, the plot is a little simplistic, but there are other times were the plot gets nice and twisty... Its not really a thought provoking plot, but its very interesting<br /><br />Last notes:<br />AS I said, it is a must-see. A friend recommended it to me, and I hate him because I am officially addicted to the show. Also, I really wish I could vote a half star, because the first season should be 4 and a half, but only four stars doesn't do it justice... Anyway, I hope this helps, and... it truly is FANTASTIC!!!!
B00LXLM05I|5|Don't play each level over and over again to start. It makes later levels impossible.
B009ZQ8FQG|5|I wasn't sure I was going to like this. But I love a good british period drama - so I gave this a whirl. Well obviously I'm on season three and it was great. Just watch one episode - you'll be hooked!
B00D7Z4GQY|5|I thoroughly enjoyed the book. I have already recommended it to all my friends. I will read more of this author in the future.
B001TH7GT6|4|Hey, whatz not to like w these monster a'zon cables.  I split them, seperated them and they peel like twizzlers, nice.  I like they're sturdy and hope they stand up over time.  Like'm i do, tho not made in this country
B009NH6JRE|5|Delivers every time! Be prepared for late nights. I just couldn't stop watching. I can't wait for the next season.
B003Y5H5BA|4|Funnier than I expected. You could easily tell how the plot was going to play out but a very funny and entertaining movie nonetheless! Can't wait for the sequel!
B006LSZECO|5|Full of twists and turns that keeps you reading.
0553801473|5|All sci-fi and fantasy fans will want to read this.  It's a monumental work that's keep you glued to the book until it's done.
B00HYTLY64|5|This is such a good movie that I would watch it again
B00006JKOM|5|Absolutely superb. If you don't have any Jethro Tull, this is a good start to get you going. Will wet your appetite for more.
B00HBQWGXK|2|Slow moving and boring. The worst Jack Reacher novel that I have read. Lee Child was not at his best. As a fan I am disappointed.
B00E8KLWB4|5|The game keeps expanding with new challenges, tasks and goals.  You can go it alone or get a friend's help.  It is also exciting to receive objects that help you meet goals.
B000003TAB|5|So, you're a big fan of Nirvana? You've got Nevermind, In Utero, and managed to track down Bleach, but you still feel like something's missing. Of course there is. You'll need this odds-and-sods disc. Originally slapped together by DGC for the Christmas 1992 market, this is particularly useful for a Nirvana fan, because it contains the two B-sides to \\"Blew,\\" both sides of the \\"Sliver\\"/\\"Dive\\" single, BBC sessions, and experimental metal tunes from the \\"Bleach\\" era. All in all, you should buy this disc, even if a couple of the songs are not quite up to Cobain's usually high standards. Jump in, realizing this is a B-sides disc, and you won't be disappointed.
068815333X|5|This series gets better with every book.  I was unable to put this book away until I weaved through all the plot twists which were spiced with wonderful dialogue.  Do yourself a favor and grab this one up quickly.  I  can't wait until his next book.
B008JGSM6G|4|Keeps everyone occupied for quite some time
B00E8KLWB4|4|Fun &amp; challenging
B00K2CHVSK|5|I love this movie!
B0036BK6MW|5|This movie still gets me every time. Great movie and true story
B00C8S9W0G|5|Excellent addition to the outlander series! Diana did not disappoint.
B00NLKA0D8|3|I thought it would be handy for ensuring security when using online banking while I am on the road.  However, it seems that my bank won't recognize the device.  Yubico needs to provide better advance information, more instructions and less hype.
B004TTZHBK|1|This application would freeze on a regular basis. I find that just googling receipes is much easier then using a phone application
B00O0OR65E|4|Addictive.
B00000G3I2|5|In updating my movie collection from tapes to DVD's, I bought \\"The Big Chill\\" and loved watching the film all over again, this time with sharper, clearer pictures.  I also enjoyed the extra features with the remarks from the actors about making the film.  What a picnic it must have been!  An amazing bunch of talent!  And great music too!
B00AGH7K7I|5|If you like great slapstick....this movie is for you. Wiley Coyote has nothing on this movie's anti-heroes. So hilarious it's sick.
B000SEGUDE|2|Mitchell tried too hard to be complicated and confusing, maybe to be considered \\"very brainy\\".  This read was not enjoyable and I actually finished it just to see what it was all about.  The centuries were never labeled which made it more confusing. The \\"southern dialect\\"<br />took too much time to figure out.  Give me Dickens!!!  I'm turned off to this guy's work unless he can make something I don't get a headache reading!
0374533571|4|Book considerably different from book but our book members all enjoyed the book and movie for different reasons.  All in all we all gave a two thumbs up.
630218021X|5|As a broke college student, I fondly remember my piano teacher giving me $2 to go see a movie she said, \\"You MUST see it!  And tonight is the last night it's showing!\\" <br />So I did go.   <br />Thirty-five years later, this movie still haunts my memory. <br />I love PIT's music and the movie helped me understand how his music could be filled with such power and passion. <br />Please, oh please, get this movie in WS DVD!!!!
B00IG2DOKM|5|This is by far the best game I've found on here! I love that it doesn't require you to invite friends just to advance and that you can earn the dollars on there easily without having to purchase! There's so many aspects of it and it goes into so much detail! Even my 3 year old loves to play it with me!
B00BSBR9N6|5|Loved it!  As another reviewer pointed out, I agree; if you love the Sheldon Cooper character in TV's &#34;The Big Bang Theory,&#34; you'll love this book!  It was hard not to think of Sheldon while reading.
B00NGYBMOK|2|I get lost with it or without it... ,  but it isn't any good unless you have wifi,  you can figure it out ahead of time and write it down, but you can't close it and reopen it to where you were without internet.
B00L9B7IKE|4|I thought it started out a little slow, maybe tedious and repetitive, but after the first half, it got more interesting and I ended up thinking it was a pretty good book!
B004W1GCNC|5|This season of Upstairs/Downstairs takes you by a rather pleasant surprise. The plot thickens as the brink of war approaches and things are shaken not stirred at 165 Eaton Place. I recommend this series to anyone who enjoys classic tales of love, war, and the classes.
B00LU0P9L4|4|Just started the game. Good graphics, sound and color like the other G5 games.
1476738025|5|I was okay with book, but as I read more of Ove's life, he became endearing.  He reminds me of my mother..  A delightful story.
B0050ACXBE|5|Excellent Product and Service
B0000399WC|5|I saw the movie for the first time when I was about 12 yrs old and loved it! Now at 34 yrs old I 've probably seen this movie now about 40 times and each time is as good as the first!<BR>Since then about 2 years ago I was finally able to get a copy of the book \\"Papillon\\" by Henri Charriere (Papillon) in English and found this book to be also one of the best books I've ever read! Yes the movie has it's differences and to be exactly like the book it would of been another hour longer(which I would of had no problem with). If you like movies about history, people overcoming great odds,human bonding and even adventure this movie has it all.<BR>  This movie is not only a MUST see it is a MUST own!!!
B002VPE1WK|5|Great and lightweight.
B00HZ3C4N6|5|Really enjoyed this movie!
B005C8ENI0|5|Enjoyed the movie immensely.  Also read the book.  Hopefully there will be more movies for these books and the Harry Bosch book series by the same author.
B00Y6QF0PE|4|She doesn't write Pulitzer's, but it was a quick read and it was what I expected it to be.  Especially being told from a man's pov
B00L9B7IKE|5|A thought-provoking suspense in a similar writing style to Gone Girl. Loved it!
141690977X|5|I love this book. It's funny and straightforward,  and most of all empowering. The topics covered are nothing new to us women,  but it's retold in such a way that you really HEAR it. I think all single women looking for that ideal relationship should read this.
B00004YKSD|4|Well...let me start out by saying I love this movie!...However...after reading Ray Manzerek's book...I must admit...I was a little upset...cause I realized the movie was nothing but a complete fabrication...I understand why Ray manzerek hates this movie so much...it only portrays the negative aspects of such a dear friend...According to Ray and many other people...Jim was charming and funny...a great guy to be around...Val Kilmer's portrayal gives no indication of this...he never shouted \\"higher!\\" into the ed sullivan show cameras...he merely sang the lyrics...the doors were never even at andy warhol's apartment...only jim was there...but I'm getting off pace...I thought val kilmer was amazing...I think the movie is great...I own the dvd...and it is a great dvd...if you want a great movie about a band in the sixties...buy this dvd...if you want to know anything about jim morrison or the doors...buy Light My Fire by Ray Manzerek...or do what I did...and get em both!!
B002BSHXJA|5|Totally rad box set, the best of the Beatles you're ever going to find!! Highly recommended! Also, great price & fast shipping! If you're even mildly into roots/pop music, you have to have this set------------------------
B00006BSC8|5|Jean-Claude Lauzon was, no doubt, a troubled genius.  I have seen Leolo many times and also the documentary about its director titled Lauzon Lauzon.<br />Leolo is a work of art.  Lauzon attacked this project like a composer attacks a symphony.  Its said that he played tapes of the musical scores for the producer, while standing over his shoulder and demanding that he read the script immediately.<br />Lauzon used music like a knife to make his points in some scenes.  We hear the sacred tones of classical hymn while we see the gritty sometimes profane reality that Leolo lives in.  There is Catholic symbolism and guilt oozing out of this film.  The voice who speaks to us off an on throughout the film is excellent; through the voice of the archivist, of Leolos<BR>papers and deepest thoughts, we are allowed access to his psyche.  The voice is also in English on the DVD.  <br />Maxime Collin is an incredible young actor.  He plays Leo who refuses to be a french Canadian boy from the poorest part of Montreal and instead he is Leolos a white shirted Italian boy who lives for romance and beauty (oh yes and the Italian Countryside is beautiful).  Our main charter repeats over and over, I think therefore I am not.  There is a lot here that Leolo would not want to be.  Crazy for starters as his family home is a bit of an asylum.   <br />If youre squeamish, steer away, there are gritty scenes here.  Yes a cat gets defiled (among other things), but for the prudish reviewer who claimed he smashed his tape at this point, I really doubt that the cat was hurt.  Kinda of like the horses didnt really die in Brave Heart, my friend!  Look beyond the cat to the social statement that is being made about the boy who is involved. Remember his mother worries that he is smoking, but has no idea what she ought to be worrying<BR>about. I wont say anymore, spoilers annoy me almost as much as Philistines who watch art film and then get all self-righteous about the gritty bits. (Hint, rent Disney instead, my friend)<br />This is an art film there is no other way to describe it. It is a comedy but its a dark art comedy so dont buy it for a laugh out loud evening, there are some really heavy and troubling elements here that will leave you thinking afterwards.  <br />The movie is beautifully filmed and well worth purchasing.  I note that the DVD is only available through Amazon.ca, at the US site they are only selling the VHS.  Buy the DVD, invite over a good friend, open some wine and enjoy the film and the long conversation that will follow it.

B009CPJHY4|5|loved it
B0087GJ8KM|5|Mr Pink has done it again!  His work makes the not so obvious, clear and simple.  I recommend this book to all.
B000R7HY0K|3|Quentin Taratinos Death Proof was a different kind of horror film.  It reminded me of Pulp Fiction with Psycho elements addes.  Kurt Russell is fantastic as he usually is.  He plays a demented psychotic who enjoys killing people with his cars.  What is interesting is that we also see that he is a coward, which adds a more interesting side to his brutal character.  There is also the element of his being someone who wants to be a killer, rather than someone who IS a killer by nature.  I took off a star because this goes on a bit too long during wordy dialog scenes.  I am not terribly into most car chases in films but this has a spectacular one at the end.  It is not a must see movie, but it was mostly entertaining, with some unique parts.
B0086700CM|5|I had been checking almost EVERY day for this game to be available for kindle fire!! (I had an ipod before). the game is so addicting!!! I cannot get enough!!
B005CRQ2XA|5|I liked this book because it a diary of a wimpy kid book by Jeff Kinney and well I just like diary of a wimpy kid books
B005ZOBNOI|5|My wife read this book and she gives it 5 stars....
B0000AQS6R|5|Very very funny!  Love it!
B000286S8S|5|Best of Both World is a must buy for any Van Halen Fan. Just the volume of music alone should give your cd changer a rest. The new tunes ROCK. With &quot;up for breakfest&quot; as the best of the new ones. Buy and enjoy and ROCK.
B00AFCEIB0|4|I like the search board and may come to love it but I'm still learning to navigate it right now.
030758836X|1|So disappointed after all the great reviews. This book was just boring. It could have been summed up in four chapters. The ending was just awful!
B005H9B2CE|4|*Thor* is a fine entry in the superhero genre. It isn't revolutionary in any way, but the story is well told and well acted.<br /><br />I remember watching the cartoon version of *Thor* back in the 70s, and that was pretty awful. Since that has been my only real exposure to the character and stories, I haven't been eager to see the movie. Then I saw *The Avengers* and decided maybe I needed to watch it after all. Glad I did.<br /><br />Chris Hemsworth brings a good bit of range to the character, which I wasn't expecting. Natalie Portman gives life and some breadth to the standard mortal girlfriend role. Sir Anthony Hopkins' Odin shows us power, wisdom, and vulnerability.<br /><br />I was surprised in reflecting on the film how extensively Thor serves as a Christ-figure metaphor. Won't line it out here, but it's pretty strong for a Norse god. This doesn't really affect my appreciation of the movie that much, but maybe the extra half-star I would give it if I could.
B000QCS8TW|5|Although AGoT is not THE best book in the ASoIaF, it is superb on an epic scale. The descriptive way GRRM paints the backdrop and characters literally transports you to Westeros. I initially digitally borrowed AGoT from library, but after reading it and subsequent books, I had to own it!  I am now rereading the whole series with a different perspective. GRRM alludes to so much, in dreams, flashbacks, and prophecies its easy to miss a huge amount given the size of the series and depth and relationships of constantly changing characters. I am seeing a lot more the 2nd time around.
B000FVE3BG|5|I love it, its a little bit big, but it works well and looks good.
B0079J28NC|5|I've seen this movie so many times, it's nuts. I love the extras that came with it as well. I plan to frame the reproduction cells eventually.
B00D6BU8GG|2|Storyline was creative in concept, but no one seemed to care about making this a good movie.<br /><br />Good: Bruce Willis is himself, although he kind of phones in the role; Lots of cars crushed by larger cars; Cool guns and helicopters; Moderately interesting plot twist.<br /><br />Bad: John McClane's son, one of the heroes, is horribly unlikable, coming off as a whiny ingrate; None of the characters is ever really developed in any way, so you won't care what happens to them; Willis' character sets off to Russia to save his son from the Russian authorities, but spends the whole movie quipping \\"I was supposed to be on vacation.\\"  No you weren't!  You were at best supposed to be there plotting strategy with lawyers and sitting through trial proceedings.  At worst you were going to watch him go to prison.  There was no expectation of vacation.  It's a stupid line!  Dialogue is canned and boring; one-liners could have been pulled from other movies, or maybe made up by the crew's kids.<br /><br />Skip this movie and re-watch Die Hard I or II instead.
B00AYB0TOW|3|While I enjoyed Karl Urban's performance as Dredd, I found the storyline to be very underwhelming.  I think this would have been a better movie if the action had taken place around the huge megacity, rather than confining it to one building.  It felt more like a sci-fi spaceship movie than one taking place on earth. I've just seen this script played out too many times.
B00H71PBQ8|5|intelligent writing
B00CA6WLAE|5|the last part made me cry my eyes out the only thing that was weird was the ghost but when I figured it out its ok. SPOILER ALERT!!!!
B00AUN2HO4|4|Delightful!  The characters couldn't have been better chosen  &  the settings were breathtaking.<br />The reason it's such a great movie is because the BOOK is so fantastic -- AND the reader's imagination*<br />I gave it only 4 stars because it COULD have been more consistent with the book.<br />If I'd been a younger version of myself, I would have been SO distracted by the inconsistencies (movie vs book) that I'd have been too outraged to enjoy the movie!
B001IZZEEI|5|The Sex and the City: The Movie The Wedding Collection Ultimate Collector's Edition is awesome! One thing that it does not say in the description is that it also includes digital copy. I would recommend this for anyone who loves Sex and the City. It is also a must have for any one who loves having a complete collection!
B009IRVSVQ|5|Excellent music!<br />I buy all my music from Amazon and am never disappointed!!<br />Comes quick, perfect, packaged and high quality!!<br />Buy all your music at Amazon.<br />Great deals!<br />Great buys!<br />Liz
B001FB0WBK|5|I rated this 5 star only because there weren't more.  Absolutely dynamite.  How can one player get so much music from an acoustic guitar?  Unquestionably the best dvd I have in a considerable collection.  MUST HAVE THIS ONE.
B005LAIIKI|5|Long movie but very moving with music and strong performances by Fox,Waltz and Dicaprio.The way Fox dispatches his enemies in such coolness is just my type of movie.One of my favorite scenes is the trek they make to the song I got a name.Loved it!!
B00S2SYTR2|1|This movie was vulgar, crude and foolish.  It was about as funny as a medevac I pulled on 18 August 1976 out of Camp Greaves just South of Panmunjon, but not as bloody. In other words, not funny by any stretch of the imagination.  I would not recommend this trash to anyone.  I just threw it away.  It is much less than one star.  It is close to 1 X 10 to the negative 32d. star.
B00M25EALG|5|We ended up seeing Lucy because my husband gently persuaded me to see it (this was one of the summer movies that caught his attention). Lucy centers around the plot of a woman named Lucy  (Scarlett Johansson) who ends up simultaneously making the best of her remaining life and doing some amazing feats after unexpectedly being given a substance that allows her to use more of her brainpower/potential. She ends up contacting a noted academic (Morgan Freeman) who she knows can help her make sense of what has happened to her. Lucy is also literally on the run for her life because the man and his entourage who spearheaded the distribution of this drug are extremely dangerous and violent people. This is a good movie to watch for those who like films that play with the concept of human potential and the probability of improving on brainpower.
B0054LJGWS|5|The Perfect Summer Read<br /><br />Are you looking for a fun, quirky book to read? Good Omens: The Nice and Accurate Prophecies of Agnes Nutter, Witchby Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman is an oldie but goody.<br /><br />If it’s an oldie, why write a review?<br /><br />Because I keep running into people who haven’t read this gem, and most of all, because I love this book. The satire is at once silly and hysterical with some honest-to-goodness wit thrown into the mix. It’s a zany romp that only the young at heart should take. There’s enough British wit and humor to satisfy anyone who likes that sort of thing, and it’s genuinely crazy enough to amuse most people. If you’re a Douglas Adams fan, well, then you’ve probably read Good Omens.<br /><br />Warning: if you have no sense of humor or if you hate silly, stop reading this review.<br /><br />Brief Summary:<br /><br />Satan and God have a huge problem: the Antichrist has gone missing, and they need him for the apocalypse. It turns out that when the lad was born, some evil nuns gave him to the wrong couple, and he grew up in a sleepy English suburb. Expect for his untapped “evil” power, he’s an ordinary kid rather like Kevin McCallister, the kid in Home Alone .<br /><br />Because they happen to like earth and don’t want it destroyed, Aziraphale (an angel) and Crowley (a demon) team up to stop the apocalypse; they are much like a British version of the Odd Couple who are trying to save the world from inevitable doom—Crowley, of course, lives life wildly and fully, while Aziraphale is quiet and refined. While everyone (God, Satan, angels, demons, and humans) searches for the Antichrist, the Four “Bikers” of the Apocalypse gather. And, yes, the Prophecies of Agnes Nutter, Witch are important.<br /><br />Pratchett and Gaiman have created a diverse and eccentric cast of characters. The impending doom is told through multiple points of view as everyone races to save or destroy the world. As any reader would expect, they all come crashing together at the end of the book.<br /><br />Why do I like it?<br /><br />This may be one of the funniest books I’ve read. First, Pratchett and Gaiman turn the story of the apocalypse inside-out, then, they turn it sideways, and finally, they manage to make the end of the world riotous and entertaining. Along the way, they poke and prod at the ordinary, the crass, and the sacred.<br /><br />I’ll admit there is a great deal of silliness about the book, and some of the motifs have been used before, but Gaiman and Pratchett take those motifs and spin them with enduring flare. After all, the book was published in 1990 and is still going strong.<br /><br />I’m always excited when someone I know reads Good Omens for the first time.<br /><br />So my friend, take a break from the real world, put aside all serious thoughts, get comfortable, and read this delicious book.der would expect, they all come crashing together at the end of the book.<br /><br />Why do I like it?<br /><br />This may be one of the funniest books I’ve read.

B004VMUS9G|5|I find this Alarm Clock Xtreme<br /> app very good and I would recomend it to anyone who needs an alarm clock
B00A4TKDKY|5|You will want it. No matter how many other versions of the songs you have.  I leave the \\"Technical\\" Mixing quality comments to others who feel they must contribute their opinion, and just review it from the perspective of a hardcore blues and Buddy Guy Lover.  If you have never been to a Blues Club for live music, be warned.  You may hear swearing, innuendo, and general ribaldry.  If that shocks you, try a different genre or desensitize.  The first seven songs, leave you longing for visuals as well as the audio, especially if you have seen him live.  The clearly noted \\"BONUS Studio Recordings\\" are welcome filler.  Bottom line - is it worth the value?  Yes.  Maybe even a hell yes. Buddy, no matter what age, is a blues ambassador, highly skilled musician, and solid entertainer.  Within that context, I can't imagine any solid blues fan or critic finding fault with what this CD really is.
B007PT3QOQ|1|this game is epic but there is a glitch that would make all of your working building have infinite time .
B007ZXK08C|3|Very fluffy in the beginning, then quite disturbing, I found the ending unsatisfactory. An reasonable holiday read.
B00U6AX3QM|4|grudging acceptance emerging, sort of.
B000M5AJQI|5|ok
B009YN2M7S|5|Great book. Great storyline .  Not exactly like the movie must the storyline just drags you in and holds you!
B000001FS3|5|This, this is the album that made everyone shut up and listen to themeselves.  In an incresingly material, ammoral age, apathetic age, The Joshua Tree is what made everyone stop dead in their tracks and contemplate where they have been and where they are now.  This was the backlash album, the album where the greed-is-good decade was brough to an abrupt climax, and caused people to atleast try to become moral again. This album is meant for those sick of the amorality of our world, for those weary souls yearning for comfirmation that there is something better.   This album is just what the world needed in 1987, but in our incresingly commercial world, we still need albums such as the Joshua Tree more than ever.  Named after the legendary knotted tree that would bring direction through the prophet Joshua, this album promises to keep things in perspective, provide a much needed relief from an increasingly bloated world, let us know that there is something better, provide a beacon of inspiration and hope in an increasingly dismal world, and drive us to keep searching for what we are looking for, whatever that may be.<br />And the Joshua Tree keeps all of these promises to the very end.
B00H83EUQW|5|This is a must have Syfi.  The acting was excellent!  Well done!  The entire movie seemed so believable and realistic.  I highly recommend the purchase of this movie.  It had us on the edge of our seats.  Sandra was way too kool!
B008X8P8A8|1|I have enough space on my kindle ankle it won't download
B00005B36H|4|Ok, i am too old for this kind of music - BUT - i love the song \\"Schism\\" i bought the CD just for that one song. Play it LOUD, and just dig it.  the rest of the album... too heavy metal for an old gal like me. my teen age son turned me on to Tool. my dear hubby, Norman, laughs when i stop everything and get jiggy with that song! but, hey, if you love it - you know what i mean! just have to rock out. not for sleepyheads or whimps.
B006FE17Q6|4|This episode was so great only because its the last one we get till Fed 12th 2012! Hurry up & wait...I hope the next half isn't as slow as this season has been so far! I say bring back the idea guy from the first season (who was fired) and get this show back on track!
B003EYVXYG|1|Romero started the zombie genre that many of us know and love but his last two films have not been deserving of his name and have tarnished his zombie legacy like ali did his boxing legacy. I thought diary was pretty bad and a bad attempt at some blair witch/paranormal activity angle but it was almost watchable however I came very close to not even making it through survival of the dead. I could not have been more disappointed after getting excited upon seeing the words \\"dead\\" and \\"romero\\" on a dvd which conjured up memories of night/dawn/day of the dead and all the great nightmares that I had as a child and still have to this day (often after playing hours of a zombie video game). The only nightmare I got out of this one was the trauma of a child who didn't get their red rider bb gun for christmas, too bad romero didn't hide the real present from mom because I wanted to shoot my eye out.     The special effects were too far over the top and stupid that they detracted from an already bad movie. The story sucked. The directing needed some direction. The acting was an obomination. And there were just so many scenes that left me wondering \\"why this is in the movie\\". For instance, there is a scene where the token military lesbian is masterbating out in the open on a jeep and in front of one of her cohorts. I'm all for throwing in some totally unneccesary nudity, hot naked zombies are a1 in my book, but despite this girl being very attractive this scene wasn't even the least bit titillating. One can justify a scantily clad zombie who just happens to have her clothes torn in all the right places or even a sex scene where two people find a moment to forget about the pending doom around them but this scene just smelled of dirty old man. It was beyond stupid and perverted. Which epitomizes this movie, stupid and a perversion of the romero zombie movie. Why george, why?
B0015DROBO|5|This book balanced multiple plots and some really unique characters to create a satisfying read.  As the first in the series, Larsson introduces us to Mikael Blomkvist, an investigative reporter recently convicted of slander, and Lisbeth Salander, a social misfit with a talent for computer hacking.  Through a series of incidents, they end up working together to solve the mystery of a teenager who has been missing for thirty years.<br /><br />My favorite part of this book was the character of Lisbeth.  I can honestly say, Lisbeth is the most unique heroine I’ve ever encountered.  Coming from someone who reads as much as I do, that is saying a lot.  In the tradition of Holden Caulfield, she is a true anti-hero.  It’s not just that she dresses in Goth clothes or has tattoos & piercings that makes her different.  Lisbeth has severe emotional and social problems, to the point that social services thinks she is mentally unstable and unable to care for herself.<br /><br />At twenty-four years old and still a ward of the state, Lisbeth is assigned an abusive guardian who has complete control over her life.  When her guardian goes too far, he finds out too late that he underestimated her capacity for revenge.  For Lisbeth, he is just another example of men who hate women.<br /><br />The character of Mikael Blomkvist is a nice balance to Lisbeth.  He is calm and rational.  He doesn’t over-react to Lisbeth’s apparent rudeness or lack of respect for his privacy.  Over time, he becomes the one person she can actually trust.<br /><br />While it took me a few chapters to get sucked in, this is a fast-paced thriller and easy to lose yourself in on a lazy weekend afternoon.<br /><br />Overall, I give The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo…<br /><br />Plot – 4 ½ bookmarks<br />Character Development – 5 bookmarks<br />Action – 3 bookmarks<br /><br />Dream Cast ( otherwise known as who I pictured while reading) – Ellen Page (Lisbeth), Liam Neeson  (Mikael), Vera Farmiga (Erika), Ian McKellen (Vanger), Helen Miren (Cecilia)ika), Ian McKellen (Vanger), Helen Miren (Cecilia)
B00BD99JMW|1|I have never felt the need to write a review for a book I just bought, but this needed to be a short and sweet warning to loyal readers out there. This was not like the first two at all. In fact, the whole book itself was a disappointment... Right down to the very end. Now that I think about it, I really should have finished this book within 7 days of buying it so I could have returned it for a refund. But no... The story was just too boring, predictable, and monotone for such a strict timeframe, it barely kept my attention at all. Mostly, that ending was ballsy, to say the least it was incredibly brave for her [Roth] and I cannot wait to see how she reacts to the fanbase and their high expectations.
B003ODIZL6|1|can't look up a single word.  It is all wrong for the kindle...  Impossible to access just, for instance  &#34;Def&#34;  Pretty useless....
B00002599I|4|i remember back in 1990 waiting for the release of this album with great anticipation.sabbath's previous two releases headless cross and eternal  idol were excellent cd's and very underrated,even classics at least in my opinion.but tyr just don't stand up to these two albums.tony martin's vocals are'nt as strong as with headless cross and eternal idol.the great tony iommi also doe'nt sound as strong as he usually does.there's really not any very bad tracks on this album but there's only a few great ones on it either.the truly standout tracks on this album for me were anno mundi,jerusalem,sabbath stones and heaven in black.the rest i would consider average.this is still a very good album just nothing great.
B00IIUATDM|2|Sleazy!
B006UG90RM|5|Great music all the way through. Someone said the chourus on songs As Is and Honeybabysweetiedoll were \\"all over the place\\" , I love those off the wall choruses.Dave's great at squeezing cool melodies over Eddie's crazy rhythms.Love the heavy darker music on this record (the \\"happy\\" stuff's great, too!). Anyway, everyone's playing great and Dave sounds good, too. Only complaint about the mix is I think Eddie's mixed too low.
B00BB8RKH6|4|I waited impatiently for this movie to become available to watch on Amazon, and I have to say it was somewhat of a let down. I was expecting, you know like a Jet Airliner becomes disabled somehow, and the pilot saves the day, this is what I expected to see through at least most of the movie, you know like the movie \\"Unstoppable\\" similar but with a Jet. I'm not going to elaborate very much here or I would ruin the movie for viewers, it's a darn good movie..don't get me wrong, but this movie has a lot of angles, and not just about a Passenger Jet crashing.........<br />If you're looking for a \\"thriller\\", ummmm I don't think so, but if you like nudity, sexual activity, drugs, and alcohol, maybe.
B00KQFXODY|2|Not a good remake and rather forgettable.
B00BAXFACO|3|I was a little disappointed in this book.  I have read several of the Mickey Haller books and have enjoyed them.  For some reason, this did not hold my interest and was expecting more.  To me, it just did not have the reading appeal/interest his other books have held for me.
B008D28HYS|5|I PLAY THIS GAME FOR HOURS EVERY DAY!!  It is addicting. I hope they update it soon and give more puzzles to work as I will be finished with those I have soon.
B00QW8TYWO|5|Love it! Soooo fun!
B00L9B7IKE|5|I will recommend this
B0064MPXFA|5|How could I have missed this for six years? Well-written and well-cast. Terrific for bingeing but you can walk away from it too which is a big advantage if you have to get up the next day for work. What could be better?
B0052UYJDC|1|The ideas in this book are almost as practical as a flat tire.
B00QTCOJPU|5|Wish it was longer
0399156577|4|I bought the audible version since it was on sale. I liked reading about the dog training and the rescues. She must have done a lot of research about dogs. I was surprised it took place on the West Coast since the author is from the East Coast. I liked the book but it has violence in it like the J.D. Robb books. Her earlier books had a lot less violence and I liked them better.
B005CRQ4GU|5|The book was excellent,and it talked about teenage love and a very,very,very weird life of a teenager. What I am trying to say is that it was funny and exciting.
B00785P2QC|5|I &lt;3 this game it is really fun and easy todo and I play it every but I think that the land should free that would make it better
B004W2UBYW|5|Must read for any entrepreneur or anyone interested in Jobs.
B00I2TV3NO|5|So good!
B000003S5H|5|I cannot stop listening to this! The first song is definitely my favorite! Anybody should get this. The music moves your body so much. I got into this after reading Spin's Top 20 Albums of the Year and this is much better that  Lauryn Hill (#1)! Listen to song one - <br />IT  RULES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00F2LKJ4Y|5|Amazing Disney adventure! One of Sidney's best.
B000VBJEEG|5|Seller was great - product came quickly and was in perfect condition, as described.  Excellent rating!
B00N35P5MW|4|Fun and challenging
0316067938|5|It's a perfect ending of Bella and Edward's love story. I enjoyed the book and cannot wait to see it on the big screen.
B003YFIUW8|5|The mother is a character like none other.  Jack inspires.  Carl Sandberg would say, &#34;he is God's way of saying the world should go on a little longer&#34;.
0679428887|4|I found Harris' novel to be exciting and thought provoking.  I enjoyed the images of modern-day Russia interwoven with those of the Soviet Union in the 1950s.  The ending may be considered far-fetched, but not beyond the  realm of possibility.  Especially when one considers the last Japanese  soldier of World War II who surrendered 25 years after the fact.  I enjoyed  the book and would recommend it highly.
B005ZOBNOI|5|I thought I was really meaningful I really love it. I was well written and is down to the heart
B006LSZECO|4|Keeps your interest.  Very good book.  Surprise ending.  Recommend this book.  What more can I say?  I'd read another from this author.
B005LAJ17M|5|Purchased Homeland First Season for one of my sons as a present for later. He loves the series and I will be purchasing other seasons as they become available.

B000002H97|5|When people think of this album, even though the amount of main albums that Metallica made was nine, an odd number, this album always comes up in the middle. This is the album when people started thinking Metallica got  trendy, mainstream, ya know sold out. Ha Ha, metallica selling out?  Wouldent believe it becuase it never happened. The black album is a classic  that will never be forgotten, trust me, never...

B002VPE1WK|2|This bag came in a package deal with my camera. I would have rather had a discount. It fits the camera and a few accessories, but way too much room is taken up with overly padded dividers. It is not easy to get into--in that, if I'm using a backpack camera case, I expect to be on-the-go, and would prefer to easily access the camera for use. If you are using the dividers, this bag needs to be laid flat and unzipped to retrieve anything, or risk everything falling out.
B0017SWPXY|5|I laughed, I cried, I noticed a marked similarity in the usage of  the concept of reincarnation in \\"A Dog's Purpose\\" and \\"The Art of Racing in the Rain\\".
B006LSZECO|4|Good book and good movie.
B005USZYDU|5|John Grisham has created a new character in Theodore Boone that should appeal to the younger generation.  His stories are intriguing and capture the imagination from the first pages.  This is a good read for young people as well as fans of his adult literature.
B000QCS8TW|5|This book is highly recommended.  I am a young reader of 13 years and I could still respected  this book as if someone with much wisdom. Definitely worth the time.
B005CGI4EG|5|ordered this series on 9/17 got it on 9/19 and I live on an island! I am just about to watch the magic, do yourself a favor and order this series now.
B00B8M4IMK|5|Anker sent me this one in place of a non-working model with 1 USB port and so far it works great.  Anker customer service was great in sending me a replacement without requiring me to ship the original charger back.  I have some other Anker products and so far am happy with them.
0743486285|5|I loved this book! Gives you an unconventional look into the whole 'rockstar' lifestyle. If you've lived a sheltered life you may find parts shocking. If this ain't your first rodeo, you may learn from a few of his mistakes.
B00ATDOVNK|5|This is a fun game and i like the helpguide for when I got stuck. The graphics are very good also.
B003M70O5O|5|Great show.
B003YNFYCO|5|I was a little young when the Beatles were together so I don't know much about the group, but I have always liked their music, and that goes for this album, 26 songs that I enjoy listening to and the sound quality, to me, is so much better than a record.
B001OGWY1W|1|Wasnt able to watch the movie. It kept freezing. And eventually it just said something like \\"unable to watch at this time\\"
0671027387|1|If you like an unbelievable, contrived plot, card board characters, and lackluster prose, this book is for you.  It took me four months to plod through this nonsense - and its only because I kept hoping the hype about this author would finally be realized - that and being anal about finishing books I start, no matter how drool and boring they become.  What does the nonsense involve? A plot by NASA to save itself by planting a fake meteorite under the Artic ice cap...to help save the presidency....YAWN!  Stink, stank, stunk!  At least it will save me from reading any more nonsense from this no talent (albeit rich) author.  Shows you that the Peter Principle is alive and well in best-seller dumb!
B009PK9SB8|3|The screen is added it last only about 20 minutes so it kills your battery for battery it already is horrible.
B00012QM86|5|This is truly one of the most powerful films of all time. ONe cannot help but be impacted by the raw reality that Spielberg reveals. Liam Neeson is the character whom Spielberg wants us all to be identified with. Neeson's character, underneath all the the seemingly inpenetrable disguise which he puts on, has a soft heart. This is especially seen in the scene whcih he drops to his knees and weeps knowing that he should have done more to save lives. Spielberg intertwines authentic Holocaust footage with personal character studies. THis is truly one of the few films that will not only stay with you many days after it is seen, but prompt you to do a little heart searching of your own. ONe cannot be unaffected by the showing of this absolute disregard for humanity and the atrocities which was committed by the Nazis. Spielbergs central character, Schindler, is one whom he and we all can identify with. Throughout the film, we can feel and understand every action and emotion which he goes through. The final scene in whcih some valuable stats are provided will absolutely shock you.
0385504209|3|This book was interesting to read.  Many of his facts or suggestions were intriguing.<br /><br /> As a christian, I had some mixed feelings about some of the alleged \\"conspiracy theory\\" of this atheist writer.<br />In fact, I did not like the way this writer tries to sell his \\"natural\\" beliefs through his characters in this fiction.<br /><br />In the end, this book is a cheap thrill.  It mocks the fundamental principles of Christianity.
B005ZOBNOI|5|5 stars isn't even ENOUGH stars. This book was amazing,  I loved it. I cried, smiled, laughed, I felt a connection with the characters you could say because of the writers way of worlds. You'll love it so read it.
B0077EBWVI|2|Sometimes remakes make sense and are fun to watch and occasionally even surpass the original movie - not this time. This movie felt like it was just going through the motions and wasn't fun to watch.
B00CNQ7HAU|2|Too many characters...finally made some sense 80% of the way through the book. Took me 8 months to read...his books usually take 3 days.

B00OV4AOG6|1|First off I got this app on an amazon promotion for free. Very disappointed. With other 'lite' versions of apps you get a trimmed down version of the 'full' app for free. This app charges for a limited use. Thats just trickry and bad business.  I have used the app several times with spotty results, mostly poor translations.  Dev, time to go back to the drawing board, create an app that works like you say it does, and charge what you want because we will pay if you put out a decent app and not scam us!
B006YM9JSW|5|Right now (April, 2012), this is probably the best choice when building a high-performing-but-not-overly-expensive computer.<br />It's priced close to the previous incumbent, the 2600k, and mobo prices are converging as well.<br />It really destroys everything you can imagine, and keeping asking for more.<br />The one thing I would say is that Intel's X79 - your only choice if your going with Intel processors today - is not, by a wide margin, as good a chipset is i7 3xxx are as processors. I mean, support to USB 3 and Sata III is dismal, to say the least.<br />But that is another story...
B007M45PMU|4|The Lumineers are really a great new sound, fresh and upbeat. The whole album is wonderful, really worth a listen.
B000FA6720|5|I've seen the movie a vouple of times & decided to read the book. I decided to ignore some of the criticsm of the authors writing style.  Its something when a book can stir such profound emotions in a reader. This book will go down as one of my all time favorites.  This is a book I will read again .
1455523003|5|I was shocked when I read this book.  I expected to find that Mother Teresa was a misunderstood saint but the evidence is quite to the contrary.  Not to be missed.
B00004BZ16|4|I have two theories on this, the group's fourth album. The first is that the success of London Calling went to their heads, and so they decided to do something artistic. But I think the more likely theory is that after London Calling, the band finally accepted the fact that punk was dying off (a fact they'd been trying to come to grips with on their third album), and decided that they'd better find another sound that they liked. Rather than explore different genres over a series of albums, like most other groups would, the Clash, being the Clash, went ahead and did it all on three records, then packaged the entire thing as one sprawling mess of an album. It's almost appropriate that Joe Strummer is wearing an army helmet on the cover. If one puts either disc into their discman and then presses PLAY, they will hear that the band does indeed try to take everything on. They don't care if they're any good at that particular genre, they will play it with all the inimitable cynicism that makes them one of the best bands of the last 30 years.    That being said, since the Clash try to tackle everything all at once, not every song on this album works. But what does work works extremely well. For example, the band doesn't just write a disco song. They'll explore it from just about every conceivable angle, but not all at once. They'll try it one way, then try something else for a few songs, then come back to disco (but this time they might try combining it with something else just to see how it sounds). They do this with every genre they delve into. Ultimately, it's up to the listener to decide what's hot, and what's not.     Of the two discs, I would have to say Disc One is the most solid. I didn't like \\"The Magnificent Seven\\" the first time I heard it, but the second time, when I listened to the lyrics, I realized the Clash was maintaining their cynical sense of humor, spinning the working-man's tale over a garish, yet addictive disco-funk beat (\\"What do we have for entertainment? Cops kicking gypsies on the pavement.\\"). So in the end, \\"The Magnificent Seven\\" deserves to be called an essential Clash song. Sadly, I can't really say the same for \\"Hitsville UK,\\" which many other fans of the group consider to be a classic song. Maybe it's the fact that Mick Jones's girlfriend is singing backing vocals. I always felt that Jones never needed help singing, unless it came from Joe Strummer (the contrasts in their voices make for some amazing harmony). But anyway, I always skip this song. A few other songs of note on the first disc are:    -\\"Ivan Meets GI Joe.\\" I don't know why I like this song. I shouldn't like it as much as I do, but for some reason, it's one of my favorite songs on the album. I would say that again, the lyrics win me over. It's as if the band somehow takes the razzle-dazzle of a Roller Rink or Discotheque, and applies it to the threat of nuclear war between the superpowers of the time (\\"He tried his tricks, that Ruskie bear. United Nations said it's all fair\\").    -\\"Something About England.\\" I especially like the role-playing between Joe Strummer and Mick Jones on this one. I think the band, like a few other English musicians, saw the socio-economic troubles their country was entering at the start of the 1980s. Of course, what makes this song great is that Strummer's \\"old man\\" character is suggesting that such things are timeless.    -\\"Look Here.\\" This one is just catchy. It's like 1940s swing jazz with the unique spin of the Clash. For some reason, I keep thinking it could be a London Calling outtake.      -\\"Lightning Strikes (Not Once But Twice).\\" One of the many hybrid songs on the album. Paul Simonon's bass sounds distinctly funk, Topper Headon's drums sound distinctly hard rock, while Strummer growls with all the ferocity one might find in an early Clash song. This is perhaps one of the finest offerings on the album. Why it didn't make it onto The Essential Clash, I have no idea.     -\\"The Sound of Sinners.\\" The fact that the Clash are tackling gospel automatically makes this song ironic. And the icing on the cake is how blatant the lyrics are in their preaching of Old Testament wrath (\\"As the floods of God wash away Sin City, they say it was written in the page of the Lord. But I was looking for that great jazz note that destroyed the walls of Jericho\\"). Now imagine the preceding line being sung with Strummer's signature lispy growl.    Digressing for a moment, one of the most prolific sounds on here is reggae, which is experimented with in many forms. We have the wonderfully disjointed psychedelic bluegrass/reggae amalgam of \\"Junco Partner,\\" the hip-hop reggae of \\"One More Time\\" (which, coupled with the following track, \\"One More Dub,\\" just might be an early ancestor of modern hip-hop), and the blatant carnivale calypso of \\"Let's Go Crazy.\\" One gets a sense that even as far back as 1980, Joe Strummer discovered a sound that he seemed to enjoy, and would serve as a main influence when he started writing music again in 1999. Anyway, moving along to Disc Two:    This one starts out nice. The first five tracks are outstanding. We have the retro punk-rocker \\"Police On My Back,\\" followed by the soft, yet sharp country-rock of \\"Midnight Log.\\" Then things get a bit more experimental with \\"The Equaliser.\\" This was another song I didn't like when I first heard it, but by the third time, I realized that the group was blending a reggae bass-line with what ultimately sounds like disco played at a lower RPM. This only serves as a prelude to some of the more bizarre experimentation on the second half of the disc. \\"The Call Up\\" is a great R and B number with snatches of punk influence, but the real standout track of the second disc is \\"Washington Bullets.\\" The politics contained in the lyrics are a bit dated by the standards of today, but the simplicity of Strummer's rhyming, combined with the xylophone track being laid down by Headon, give the song the feel of a children's nursery rhyme (\\"Andin the Bay of Pigs in 1961, Havana fought a playboy in the Cuban sun. For Castro is a color is redder-than-red. Those Washington Bullets want Castro dead. Castro is a color that will earn you a spray of lead.\\") But once again, this just adds to the song's irony. Sadly, after track five, the second disc begins to fall apart. A few more highlights are \\"Charlie Don't Surf\\" (with its low-key Middle-Eastern influences), \\"Kingston Advice,\\" and \\"Version City.\\" But most of the rest of the disc consists of sampling earlier songs on the album, while adding layers of weird effects that ultimately don't serve any unique purpose. Or the band just does things that seem cheap and garish (such as having a child sing a cover of \\"Career Opportunities\\"). But as I said earlier, on an album of this scale, one can't expect everything to work.     So, in the end, and as the song says, \\"What have we got?\\" Well, according to a website I visited, the Clash were a band whose primary interest was sharing ideas with people. This album definitely contains an overwhelming amount of ideas, both lyrically and musically. I have yet to meet someone who likes every track, since there are thirty-six. But ultimately, if you find what works for you, then Sandinista! is a great album. It may not seem like it the first time you listen, but by the third time, hopefully you will realize that the Clash knew what they were doing, and after all is said and done, we are left with a work that might not be as legendary as London Calling, but still has a significant place in the Clash's catalog.
B000NVIXFK|4|wow!!! i just read alot of the reviews for s&a and it appears the boys have struck a up a bit of controversy with some of us here.well here is my 2 cents on this cd.i am a 26 year long hardcore rush fan.snakes and arrows is hands down their best work in at least 14 years.the production alone is probably their best ever (vapor trails was a sonic disaster!!!!)i cant stop listening to this cd.i find it to be an emotionally moving listen. yes it does have a somewhat negative theme that questions faith, and paints a bleak outlook on the world in ways that are not found on earlier rush albums BUT!!!! does anyone really expect Neil to be the same ever again after the horror he went through 10 years ago??? i don't, and thats o.k with me.i am a christian and songs like \\"faithless\\" and \\"the way the wind blows\\" don't offend me at all. Neil is just pouring his heart out about some things on his mind.musically this cd shines.Alex does really creative, powerful playing here. Geddy's playing is real smooth and melodic,and Neil does some of his best work too.this is the first time in many years that i've gotten this excited over a rush album (the last time was \\"HOLD YOUR FIRE\\").my only points of criticism are that the meter of the lyrics are kind of awkward in spots (Geddy must have had a hard time writing melody to some of these songs)and the overuse of harmonies on the vocals. i would have liked to hear just one voice on some tracks...like the old days.this is a great new cd from one of the best bands in rock history. if you dont have this cd yet, get it... ....NOW!....WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?? .....GET OFF THE COMPUTER AND GET THIS CD ALREADY!!!!!!

B000003TAB|4|I recently just started listening to Nirvana about a few days ago, ever since karaoke night this past weekend. A guy was doing the song &#34;Smells Like Teen Spirit,&#34; which he did an amazing job imitating the singer. I really enjoyed the song and I even liked the lyrics, when I got home I wanted to listen to the original artist. I fell in love with that song. Now, I don't own any Nirvana cd's yet. Yeah, yeah I know what u guys are going to say...I SUCK!! Right? But, u have to understand I just started listening to them not too long ago. I've been listening to their songs on YouTube, and I must say I really am digging Nirvana.<br />I really don't like Cobain's voice too much, I mean I love his guitar playing, but I don't understand what he's saying on a lot of these tracks. I've been looking up their lyrics becuz I can't understand what Kurt is saying. Their drummer KICKS ASS, especially on Aero Zeppelin...that is the coolest song on the cd! I played it about 20 times already! Lol! If I had to grade this cd, I'll give it a...B+! ;)<br />Oh, and by the way I'm a huge rock and roll fan!!!!:) MUAHHHHHHHHHHHHHH to all my rock and rollers!!!!

B006P4FBUE|1|It was a great app to begin with! Then.... after a little bit of playing some songs that I know, the sound would not work!!! I checked my volume and it was working perfectly!!!

B0001MDP3G|5|First of all, Nicole Kidman puts forth a brilliant performance in this movie. From a spoiled young girl of wealth to one who quickly has nothing and has to learn some very tough lessons about survival, she comes through with flying colors.    I could feel her pain and the pain of her love who so desperately tries to return to her. Not uncommon, for the bond of true love is strong. Gripping scenes throughout kept my interest. Excellent example of friendship from those whom we least expect it. Renee Zellweger is a favorite and was a delight to watch her in this extraordinary role.    But the end was not what I expected. Definately worth seeing.     Gail Gupton, Author: The 31-Day Diet of Spiritual Enlightenment and Seekers of Truth.

0345803485|1|I can't wrap my mind around the phenomenon that is Fifty Shades of Grey. I got a third of the way through the first book and felt like my brain was dribbling out my ear--every sentence is poorly written and unbelievable. The characters are obnoxious and one-dimensional. My only conclusion is that it must have been written by and for a sexually inexperienced and socially awkward thirteen year old girl. Don't waste your time or money. Fifty Shades of Grey is an embarrassment and nothing remotely interesting, provoking or erotic.

1623420148|2|It wasn't the laugh out loud book that I was expecting.  The reviews made it seem like this was a funny and romantic book that would grab me and make me want to read it again and again.  It wasn't.  I didn't laugh or  even smile once while reading this book.  It wasn't awful, but it wasn't anything special either.  I don't feel the urge to tell my friends and family members to read it.  I don't want to relive moments from the book or reread my favorite scenes (I don't have any).  I don't see myself reading it a second time.  It wasn't a torturous read, but it was nothing to get excited over.  I guess I am still trying to figure out what all the fuss is about.  I guess it was good if you want to get a glimpse into a man's mind, but seeing as the book was written by a woman, take everything with a grain of salt.
B009EHDU7U|5|A rollicking adventure that surprises and delights at every turn. I was reminded of the film Forrest Gump in this tales marrying of historical moments spun deliciously with fiction. Though this take is wittier and a little darker in its comedy. Highly recommend!!
B005H0IW6W|3|a little bit disappointed. I wasn't expecting Harry Connick, Jr style in a Buble CD.  Buble voice in my mind is young, hip and passionate, but in this CD is coarse, lay back. I can tell he might be trying to be that way, but it is not a very successful experiment. If I want to listen to Harry Connick, Jr, I would buy his CD (by the way, I love Harry C. Jr).   I was hoping to save this Christmas CD for many years to come since Boble is my favorit Jazz singer. But now I guess this version is going to Goodwill after the Christmas. Looking forward to a next year re-issue.

B005LAIHE0|2|I guess it is too late for that. All I have to say is that this was almost physically painful to watch.
B00957T6X6|5|If you have watched the HBO series this is a must read, even if you haven't watched it yet, after reading it you will want to watch all three seasons back to back.
B00AMBLXP8|3|It is funny, but not for younger children or mixed age groups.  It is kind of silly but cute, again I would wait till it was shown for free.
0141439610|5|All of Collin's books are great fun, well written page turners, but I think this is my favorite. The characters, the spooky story the whole package!!  Collins is greatly under-rated, read The Woman in White and you'll know why.

1439138311|4|Colm Toibin writes about people who are displaced, whether from their inner lives, society or by physical distance. In Brooklyn, he captures what must have been the experience for literally millions of Irish-Americans, when he tells the story of Eilis Lacey, a young Irish girl whose family sends her to America because they believe she will have a better life. I read the book in one day, and found it to be achingly poignant. Anyone who is Irish will recognize the stories in this book; anyone whose grandparents or ancestors were immigrants will finally understand exactly what they went through.    I have a couple of criticisms of the book. Any male author who writes about a woman cannot truly capture her innermost thoughts, nor could a female author really know what men believe. In this sense, Brooklyn suffered from a sense of dispassion. Things are happening to Eilis that would be earth shattering for many women, especially after WWII, when it was still very unusual for women to travel so far alone. Likewise, the growth that Eilis experiences after she arrives in America would prompt a woman to react more emotionally than Eilis does in these pages. She struck me as slightly more analytical and unfeeling than woman in her situation might be.    Also, I would have loved the book to have been longer. There's so much to know about Ireland at the time, Brooklyn at the time, America at the time. Toibin puts a lot into the book and leaves it to the reader to do their own exploration. But these shortcomings do not detract from beautiful writing, a lovely story and a character that I could see and touch in my mind's eye. Another well-done book by an author who easily rivals Ian McEwan.
B0014EU5XI|4|I enjoyed a lot of the music on this CD, but a few were remakes and they didn't do it for me. A little over half were what I liked. Overall a good buy!

0307352145|5|Susan Cain seems to have a deep understanding of what makes us introverts tick and how society could benefit from allowing them to shine in their own way rather than trying to fix them (me, us) I display a copy of her book prominantly on my bookcase with pride knowing I helped to support someone who gives a voice to the quiet giants. I hope the world takes notice and we learn to take full advantage of the talents and skills introverts have to offer.
0452270073|3|Pat Barker's novel \\"Regeneration\\" is an interesting account of the shell-shocked soldiers and poets of WWI. Her use of real people for the characters of the novel (Siegfried Sassoon, Robert Graves, Wilfred Owen, and others) adds versimilitude. She delves deeply into the meaning of the bizarre dreams and fantasies of the soldiers in a mental hospital and their reactions to their experiences in the war. The beginning of the book is strong and well written, but as it progress she tends more toward the bizarre and symbolic; particulary with Burns' condition.     This book focuses on the anti-war position of Sassoon, but I feel that \\"All Quiet on the Western Front\\" is a more successful anti-war story. This novel reeks of fiction despite the fact that she bases it on historical personages, and to some extent the horrors of the war seem manufactured, whereas in \\"All Quiet on the Western Front\\" the author experienced the war first hand and therefore his story is a much deeper account of such a fraught time in history.    I read \\"Regeneration\\" in an afternoon, and found it enjoyable, though the author's tendency towards the overly metaphorical was irritating. The best part of the book was the focus on WWI poetry and insights into the poetry through the characters in the novel.       - A.B.
0399165274|3|From 1971's &#34;The Day of the Jackal&#34; to his 2010 offering &#34;The Cobra&#34;, Mr Forsyth has spun intricate tales that kept the reader on the edge of their seat.  From character development, to great plot twists, to the fine details of the locations, you got completely immersed in the story line.  His new book &#34;The Kill List&#34; is devoid of these characteristics.  The plot is fine however, character development is non-existent (to the point where you really didn't care about the characters), there are no plot twists, and the storyline could have occurred anywhere.<br /><br />Here are my thought after reading the Kill List: I'll assume that Mr Forsyth had a book  deadline coming due and he spent a whole weekend on his typewriter.  All I can say is: Fred - if it's about the money, then call James, and he'll teach you how to churn out 20 books in a weekend.
B00F35B8F8|5|I'm a fan of the franchise. Always have been and, this movie is filled with everything a sci-fi film needs and...you get to meet Kahn.
0345803485|5|As soon as I heard that the movie was going to be coming out I had to read the book first. It seemed like everyone else had so I guess I need to see what the hype was about and I loved it. I am now halfway through the second book and looking forward to the 3rd. This book was in great shape and was delivered quickly.
B00B4804KS|5|Everyone knows it's a great movie..... best in the series so my review is on the 3D.  Not the best blu-ray quality as far as picture goes. Some scenes weren't very sharp. Blacks were more grey BUT...... the 3D blew me away. This is better than most current 3D movies in theaters now. I bought the Predator 3D movie using the same technology and was impressed but this is better.
B006JD48NM|5|Amazing movie.  Yes it's a documentary but it's so well done and so emotional.  If you didn't know Senna, you will after watching this movie.  Too bad we don't have him around anymore.  What a great racing movie.
B0054JZC6E|3|not terrible. good way to pass time. controls aren't great and the ads are frustrating, but what do you expect from a free app?
B009CVRQLY|5|Another great project from Celine! She continues to push her own boundaries to keep her music fresh and new. She is an incredible artist.
1476746583|2|This book received lots of praise, yet I found it very disjointed and non engaging. The reader only has a slight attachment to a couple of the characters and much of the story is an implausible ho hum. With so many great books written about WWII and everything related to it, I can't understand how this book has garnered such good review. It may be just me, but I really couldn't recommend this book to anyone.
B00EGJE4G2|5|I have never spent time reading about our environment, evolution, etc. I found this book to be fascinating. Even though it is not my study field and many terms were new to me, it was so enlightening to me as a resident of this planet. Clearly, we have not been good stewards of the earth. This has made me think seriously of what I need to do to help our planet if it isn't already too late. I read Bill Nye's book previous to this one. I suggest reading them together. I loved them both.
B004Q7CIFI|5|Loved this mind bending escape into the world only Stephen King could create. \\"The past is obdurate\\". George Amberson, aka  Jake Epping, found out first hand the effects of attempting change it on his excursions in and out of the past. The price paid was a pound of flesh and sometimes much more including a love he discovered in Sadie, cloaked in secrets, losing the \\" pound cake \\" they shared and wonderful innocence (portrayed eloquently) at a small town, Texas high school.  All of these bittersweet pieces of life were the essence of the story.The Kennedy assassination was almost irritating information, at times too detailed, yet necessary as a vehicle to move the reader through this period . A few of the characters in the \\" land ago \\" saw George/Jake as a ghost; these were those soon to depart who had suffered and glimpsed already to the other side; half ghosts themselves. He discovered that he belonged to the past and preferred it, yet was pulled away, painfully and unwillingly. The (gatekeeper) yellow card man was dripping in symbolism in large form and smaller bits were scattered within the book; these head scratchers I thoroughly enjoyed.    I was surprised at the delicate nostalgia King, the prince of horror, unfolded,in well scrubbed and well researched detail. I could hear the big band sounds and relax in the simple world with delicious smells of homemade meals and less complicated times. While the mission was to stop Oswald, the journey back to another time was the mesmerizing thing. The obdurate past (Don't forget that word! Stephen did you think we would forget...when is the test?) is there to remind us that the sweet simplicity of times before, call to us. In this book it was through the rabbit hole, an unexpected avenue in the pantry of an old fashioned burger joint.  Thanks for the memories on another great ride.
B00881VLCE|5|I've always loved jigsaw puzzles, but never knew what to do with them when I was done. Tried a few different apps before. This by far has the most realistic quality and amazing gallery! If you love puzzles, this is the app for you.
B009ZZDNT6|5|Honestly, despite ads and such, it works great. Besides, the ads aren't going to be bugging you when you sleep, so no issues whatsoever. It did notify me to rate it and I'm pretty sure it would've kept notifying me until I did. Overall, easy alarm app. Blah blah blah blah, I'm wasting your time now. Aoml yyyyyyyyya,
B003405MF6|5|Awesome CD!!! Music like this only comes from a master!!
B006O6F932|1|I have purchased my fair share of Mattel products (Barbie;s, Barbie cars, horses, cars, campers) this is by far the WORST Mattel purchase.<br />Sorry Mattel lovers. Flimsy plastic, too many stickers with no direction as to where they go, everything falls over and out of place. My daughter was so excited and as we set it up, I saw her excited turn to frustration as everything broke or fell off.<br />Are you kidding me that I paid $75 for this thing? It's not worth $30...sorry
B0013D6LEM|5|I bought this song because it is beautiful. I have liked this song for months. This is one of Michael Jackson's best songs.

B00BAXFECK|5|Marveling over the incredible story of The Goldfinch early on, I thought the novel would be plot-driven, which might have been enough.  But author Donna Tartt goes so much further.  A story about a traumatic event and its aftermath becomes a lyrical tale about love and beauty and survival in the catastrophic cesspool (the author's words) that is life.  Accompanying such pessimism, though, are glimmers of hope.  I read the last few pages three or four times because I was so impressed -- and moved -- by what Tartt accomplished.<br /><br />A scene early on in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, as the main character's mother explains that transcendent works of art usually offer a glimpse of suffering and death, Tartt expertly lays out the themes of The Goldfinch.  But nothing prepares the reader for what comes next and next and next.  Great art, like life, can be a burden.
B00785P2QC|3|This game is a really good time waster, for procrastinators like me. It does take a while to get investment points without going bankrupt.
B00BD99JMW|5|You must finish what you started! Finishing this series is a must. Divergent through Allegiant! Then it all makes sense. And I am content.
6304698623|1|Don't waste your money on this mess.  Perhaps someday someone will make a version of 'A Little Princess' that's worthy of the name, but this isn't it.  The only resemblance between this production and Frances Hodgson Burnett's 'A Little Princess', aside from the title, is the fact that it has characters named Sara, Ram Das, and Miss Minchin, and the only reason this gets any star at all is because Amazon will not let me give it no stars.  All the artful camera work in the world cannot make this dreck into proper telling of 'A Little Princess'.  It hasn't the magic.<br /><br />What was Cuar&oacute;n thinking?  Did he even read the book?  If so, he didn't understand it.  No dead father?  No London setting?  No Cockney Beckey?  No money-grubbing, toading from Miss Minchin?  No fabulous clothes and furs at the front of the line?  No suffering prisoners in the Bastille and no fortuitous finding of the four-pence?  Wrong, wrong, wrong!<br /><br />Instead of mysterious diamond mines we are given crackers!  Seriously.  Crackers!  Instead Mr. Carrisford's dramatic recovery and Ram Das confessing how he created 'magic', we're given a tawdry police pursuit in the rain and a soap-opera amnesia plot point.  Instead of kind, wise, insightful, introspective and thoughtful Princess Sara, we have foisted on us a prank playing, spiteful retorting, 'curse' slinging pretender to the throne who would never care enough for the general populace to make arrangements to give bread (or even crackers) to the poor.<br /><br />And we have thrust down our throats repeatedly the mantra that, \\"every girl is a princess\\", apparently no matter how spiteful, unkind, or common her behavior.  Sarah's princess-like nature was supposed to be what set her apart from the common girls, no matter her material circumstances.  Talk about missing the point.
B001UC09ZS|3|Interesting.
B00IIOFVYA|5|I liked this game I could not stop playing it I hope they come out with a sequel I like those kind of games
B00ECU2SGS|4|Good movie, excellent acting. Story line was easy to follow plus the plot had sufficient mystery to keep me interested
B009Z59ZNE|5|Richardson crossed the Atlantic ocean to entertain America with his wickedness, wit, and dry humor to bring alive the House of Cards to such a high level of entertainment you could be thinking you are watching a late night news program on your television unfold into a sensational mystery containing all the ingredients of scandal, sex and political manipulation.
B009KS4XRO|4|Loads of fun very frustrating I wish it didn't take sooo long to finish rooms but I'm greatful you can trade just becareful of the scammers
0143144006|5|I heard Jill Bolte Taylor interviewed on NPR and knew I had to get this book for my mother. Mom has had severe verbal aphasia for 5 years, which means she can understand you and she knows what she wants to say, but cannot verbalize well. However, her abilities have improved a lot in just the past 90 days. She finds this book inspiring because the author completely recovered from her stroke in about 8 years.     I ran through a few of the revelations from the author with Mom. For example, she said that her stroke made her feel more connected with other people, as if we were all liquids instead of separate solids. \\"Yes!\\" Mom agreed heartily.       She also said that as the stroke occurred, aspects of it were actually enjoyable--e.g., losing the verbal imperative, thinking visually, etc. Another \\"yes\\" from Mom.      Highly recommended.     P.S. Mom's abilities have continued to improve. Last week she told my Dad, \\"You need to call [our daughter] and remind her about her 9:00 appointment in the morning!\\" She and Dad then laughed and laughed with joy. He called me and said, \\"Your mother has just uttered her most complex sentence in 5 years!\\"
1475143389|1|There are a lot of comments in this book that have no reference or studies footnoted. Such as &#34;&#34;most soybean supplements use genetically modified soybeans (a dangerous trend encroaching further and further into the world of agriculture)&#34;. Really? Says who? Also: &#34;the ever-declining quality of American soil&#34;, again- where is your research to back this comment up? . I think there is some good stuff in here, but the author should refrain from soapboxing about comments he has no knowledge about. I'm only a few chapters in but this is already aggravating.
B008MG1E4A|4|Well described account of the mission. The author gives the reader a real sense of<br />being in the middle of the action. Thank God for Navy Seals.
B003YL4LYI|5|This is one of the better books of the series.  I feel like we moved ahead in the story, finally.  But I so want a resolution!<br />I'm always surprised at who has been killed off in Martin's books.  This time, we don't know who is still around to play in the next round of the Game!
B00HV2KPNW|5|My 2 Girls really enjoyed this movie.  It wasn't bad for the adults either.  Great movie night pick for the family.
B009JZWO3I|5|Great series and now all caught up for the current season. The acting and story lines were great. The guest stars were an added bonus.
B000I2J6K0|5|This was the perfect workout I was looking for! I shopped around and when I saw the reviews on this DVD I knew its what I wanted. I was looking for something that would give me a good workout, to replace the running I used to do. It was a good, safe workout, that pushed me, I am now sore because of how good it worked me. I liked how it was in a home setting, not a cheezy 80's arobic room, so I didn't feel silly doing the workout. She's a good coach, fun to work out to. Totally recomend this DVD

1611762855|4|felt like a bit of a let-down from the earlier segments. Perhaps the recent history is more difficult to play around with....
B00GH4RKYM|1|the movie is good, but the sound quality totally SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! wHEN PEOPLE TALK, HAVE TO BLAST THE VOLUME TO HEAR WHAT THERE SAYING, THEN HAVE TO TURN IT DOWN AS SOON AS THE SPECIAL EFFECTS KICK IN...............NOT THE FIRST TIME WITH AMAZON INSTANT VIDEO.....
B00992CF6W|2|I liked the game at first but then I made a world that was really glitchy and so...I tried to delete it but it would not let me.
B007FH9GA6|3|The writing of the mystery portion was excellent.  The movie as a whole had the feeling of the Tom Hanks movie &#34;Road to Perdition&#34;.  Dark, dark, dark...nothing redeeming about the characters...constant disappointment with people...I guess Lisbeths ability to fight her way through what a Godless world has thrown at her, gives me a feeling of respect for her that she has survived the evil things that came her way....but to what end?  I wanted to give it 2 stars but the mystery of Harriet's &#34;murder&#34; was well done in my opinion....don't think I will watch the other two flicks and will probably delete this one....
B00IAGUSCG|5|This is relatively simple as far as RG's go, looking quite similar to the HG exia. The obvious advantages over the RG exia have to be the chrome plated weapons and the blue ribbons. They're nice extra details which add a little flair to this exia.<br /><br />However, what it lacks in complications it makes up for in simplicity. Unlike most RGs this thing is pretty solid. The only issue is, like usual with Exia models, the weak connection between the GN blades and the hips. It's &#34;okay&#34; but it doesn't stay on too well. The shield doesn't stay on very well either, but it's quite nimble and easy to get on compared to some of the other RG models.<br /><br />Also, if you're worried about the chrome parts looking ugly, take a deep breath. One of the nubs is hidden completely, and the other is on the edge of the blade. If you're very careful, it only leaves a small line of dull gray, about a millimeter long, on each of the chrome parts. It's not noticeable at all unless you know exactly where it is and are within arms reach to it. This advice applies to all 3 of the blades.
B00E9A656K|4|New cars and challenges. Great graphics and motion that put you up close to the action. All that and the price is right.
B000YXMMAE|5|Great guitar, lyrics, harmony, all the talents of the entire band showcased in this one CD. If you can define Radiohead, you're missing the point of their work. If you GET the point of their work, you can't define them. And you can't keep your head away too long, can you? Huh, am I right? Just try this CD. I dare you.
B00005JPKE|5|Well done movie by Clint Eastwood.  Shows all sides on one of the most horrific battles in the Pacific Theater.  A must see.
140006922X|5|Well researched.  Written very readable, not dense or boring.  And the times and main character are fascinating to know about.
B007PVHMCG|5|GOOD
B0000AQS0F|5|We so enjoyed this immensely.  The series sets up the entire baseline for the movie \\"Serenity\\", and includes the original cast.  The futuristic sci-fi series has well-developed characters, and has a witty humor that is very entertaining.  Although I had a slight problem with the wild west \\"cowboy\\" accent, (there is an attempt to explain this) I feel it would have faired well enough without it.  I think that had FOX not aired the series out of sequence, and allowed a fan base to be established, this series would have been very successful.  There still is a following for Firefly including a line of merchandise.  I think I join those who hope that it will resurface and let the story continue.
032147404X|5|This book is a very good compilation of practical photography tips especially for a novice like me. It is very easy to read, understand and apply in real life. In no time I am starting to shoot good photos and post-process them. It is not filled with photography jargons that would intimidate a beginner; rather it will make the novice (and seasoned alike) become inspired and excited with digital photography. I speak from experience.

0783223676|5|\\"Is it Awake?\\" the husband played by Bruce Willis whipsers tentatively ...... the 'help' cautiously affirms .... THAT's only the beginning. \\"It\\" is played by the brilliant Meryl Streep - [makes Norma Desmond look like Maria Von Trapp] A cautionary caustic tale of \\"Hollywood has-almost-famous Beings\\" seen through the eyes of director Robert Zemeckis. Wonderful one-liners along the lines of \\"She'd go to the Opening of an Envelope!\\" [the fabulous Goldie Hawn re. Ms. Streep's vixenish star], and the gut-rumbling \\"NOW A Warning??\\" Streep to Isabella Rossellini as the vampish immortal - after consuming the all-life-giving potion.<br />It's a TREMENDOUS onyx comedy about Tinsel Town and its dark little secrets - JUST a PITY that the current DVD version is so bland - NOT in wide screen and no extras worth mentioning - especially the spectacular special effects, make-up etc. etc. etc.<br />Very underrated - highly recommended and due for a rebirth as a SUPERBIT special edition!!
B00338QENI|5|Astonishing.

B00FHEP9XM|5|Works perfectly. Far superior than the Samsung keyboard on the s5. Detects words accurately. Texting frustration completely gone now.
B00000F214|5|It seems that the Blu edition has zero special features but the Special Edition has quite a few. Otherwise a great movie.
B0013FSL0C|5|Buy it; watch it and you will see why this will go from strength to strength. The acting is spot on as are the characters themselves. The psychotherapy its self is not perfect (neither is Yalom) and that is what makes this series so good .I can not wait for the next collection to come out.

B007RQ6WCA|1|I cannot get it to work!!!
B003UBTX7C|5|Love all books of Oliver Stone series. This one might be the best.
B004GJDQT8|5|I love this app. For the most part it works with little glitches here and there. It remembers everything in my cart, without saving or exiting it any correct way. I can cancel asap if I accidentally chose the wrong shipping method, and then re-order and it's all a quick and simple process as long as you do it once you'd realized the mistake. I don't like that it automatically seems to sign me up for the more expensive shipping, so now every time I order I have to go back and change it. But overall a great app. I haven't had any issues with fraud, I've had some issues with not getting a product from overseas but they try to refund, they only refund the product not the shipping, and sometimes only one product not all of them. But they were cheap enough for me to not care much. Again overall great app.
B0074VTHKM|5|This book is a page-turner that really keeps you guessing.<br />I am recommending that you read this book for action, suspense, and mystery.
0307387178|5|What drives a young man to abandon his former life completely? In April of 1992, a young man named Christopher J. McCandless donated his entire savings to charity, burned most of his possessions, packed up his yellow Datsun to reinvent a whole new identity for himself.  In the book \\"Into the Wild,\\" the author, Jon Krakauer, helps the reader understand the mind of Christopher McCandless.  Through-out the book the author touches on his own life experiences.<br /> The reasons are unbeknownst to his parents Walt and Billie and a sister Carine with whom he was extremely close.  He was a man of intelligence and fierce ideals.  It seemed Chris McCandless was driven at a young age.  He seemed to be especially hard on himself and set the bar high.  He, unlike most was willing to live out his dreams and ideals no matter what the cost.<br /> Into the Wild begins with Alex, the moniker he invented to disappear if you will stumbling upon Jim Gallien hitching in Fairbanks, Alaska.  This would be Alex's final and ultimate adventure.  Gallien picked him up and agreed to drive him to Denali National Park en route to the Stampede Trail.  He thought Alex was \\"another delusional visitor to the Alaska frontier.\\"  But like most people who met him at first Alex seemed to win them over as thoughtful and intelligent.  He was not some wild flake trying to get lost in the wilderness to escape societies pliers.<br /> One of the things main things that affected me when reading this book is the impact Chris McCandless had on the people he came across in his two plus years tramping.  It's awe-inspiring to witness anyone living out their dreams in our society that go against the norm especially against one's parents.  It was apparent to anyone who had gotten close to Alex that he was struggling hard with his parents materialistic ways.  He was especially offended when they offered to buy him a new car for his college graduation demanding that his used Datsun was more than sufficient; that he worked hard to buy that car he had since high school, the car that brought him to Miami then across the country without a single problem.<br /> Overall, I felt the book was an easy read.  The story of this man's life is compelling and intriguing to readers of all age groups.
B00005NP04|5|The best of Martina!
B00JBGWP3Y|5|Ordered this on Friday, got it on Tuesday.  What can I say but I'm pleased and impressed!!! Will do business again and again with Amazon!!!

B0063GORYU|5|I'M ADDICTED
0767817478|1|First, this is not a Godzilla film. I don't state that because I'm some sort of traditional Toho Godzilla zealot, I say it because this film really has nothing in it that connects it in any way to the Godzilla franchise. The creature in this film is a slender, fleet-footed lizard that doesn't have atomic breath, doesn't fight a monster adversary, and doesn't try to cause destruction. It's just a dinosaur-creature. I think that these facts explain why a lot of traditional Godzilla fans were, to put it mildly, very disappointed. This film is not at all geared toward Godzilla fans, which raises the question of why it uses the name \\"Godzilla\\" at all. I mean, if the film doesn't appeal to them, and if the name is going to turn away people who don't like the traditional Godzilla movies, then what's the purpose of calling it Godzilla instead of establishing a new franchise? Well, I don't know the answer to that question, but I can suggest the following: Had the film been a success, it could have spawned a Hollywood Godzilla franchise separate from the Toho one. Traditional Godzilla fans may be glad that didn't happen, but they must recognize that Toho did it. I mean, some people love the original Godzilla but despise the goofy series of movies in the late 1960s that included, e.g., \\"Godzilla vs. Megalon\\". And with regard to adhering to Godzilla traditions, remember how Godzilla was able to fly using his atomic breath as propulsion in his battle with Hedorah the smog monster? The bottom line is that there is a Toho Godzilla film for every type of traditional Godzilla fan to hate. With that said, I think the producers of this film may be guilty of arrogance and condescension in rejecting every feature of the Toho Godzilla films, but that doesn't mean that the end product can't be a great addition to the Godzilla legacy. <br />Okay, so I said in my above title that I wanted to get a couple of things straight. The first was that this film isn't in any way related to traditional Godzilla films, but that doesn't necessarily mean that it's terrible. The critical second thing to get straight is that this movie does happen to be very bad. I can only believe that the positive reviews listed with this review must have been written by people connected to the producers because I have yet to meet anyone who strongly liked it. Most, like me, think it's a maudlin story about unappealing characters with occasional special effects exercises involving a big lizard. In fact, many people found it insultingly patronizing: The exploitation of the Godzilla name, the pandering (and awkward) inclusion of the Jean Reno character once it was decided that it would debut at Cannes, the rip-off of Jurassic Park at the end, the sickly and manipulative relationships between Broderick and just about every other character (including the lizard), and most of all the deviation between the heavily promoted nature of the film and the actual film itself. It really is a very bad movie.
B000EULJLU|5|Although many people went into details how great this album was and how great it was not. The 4 long years waiting were more than worth it. I would give 10,000 dollars for this album. By far the best tool album and by far the best album made in the last 15 years. I dont understand how people say Tool has lost its flavour? wings part 2, well lets start with that.........the end of that song is a virtuoso masterpiece for danney...im a drummer and thats well, the drumming is some of the best ive heard. My second favorite song is rosetta stoned. moody, yet delacate, yet strong, and well, Jambi! powerful!!!! everything about this album is perfect. although u do have to be in the right mood to truly understand this album and you have to truly understand alot about music to fully apprieciate this album. I RECCOMEND THIS TO EVERYONE ON THE PLANET AND THIS ALBUM WILL GO DOWN  IN HISTORY AS ONE OF THE GREATEST ALBUMS EVER MADE, ATLEAST IN MY HEART IT WILL!!!!!!!
B00JZK0QNM|3|This is a very fun and addictive game, however I give it three stars because of a bug I've encountered during the purchase of the in game crystals. After a couple of tries and wasted money the crystals I bought where never added to my account. And the several times I sent a report to the support they have yet to respond. So if I where you I would not bother trying to buy in game crystals until they fix this.

B009FB3XTA|5|They went out with a bang with their music selection this time. Great for background and easy listening. Like always, the best song choice for the movie.
B0014JKJHK|5|anyone that works standing on their feet all day will love thse crocks. They also do not slip or slide on snow , ice, or wet floors!!
B000W8HC8I|5|You need to read this before you see the movie. It paints a totally different picture than the movie. You will walk away with a better understanding without all the glamorized perks.
B000FBGBPC|5|if you liked thier first cd buy this one. if you dont have their first one buy them both, they are good from beginning to end
B00JCW0BCY|5|By focusing on how doctors treat the dying, the author re-thinks the goals of medicine from the ground up, and gives readers a chance to consider for themselves the goals and autonomy he discusses. The book is  well-written, a pleasure to read for such a difficult topic.
B001AQO3QA|5|The packaging is amazing and the Blu-ray quality is to die for.  It's a wonderful addition the Alien collector's collection!
B00NUB4EVC|5|A great read indeed. Very helpful in getting a hang of modern physics. Read it and watch the movie  again
0060989157|5|This is worth the cover price just for Nikki Sixx's story alone, at least up until the band's decline in the early 90's.  I was in 4th grade when Theater of Pain came out and that and Shout at the Devil were my soundtracks of life.    Even if you don't respect their music (which bothers me because Mick's riffs and Nikki's writing -though yea, misogynst and shallow sometimes, and \\"hooky\\", were good, solid, punk/bluesy anthem rock and roll) this book is a full-on page turner.  My little brother is not a Crue fan and he finished it in 2 days.  Basically the Crue came at exactly the worst time for self annihilation, after bands like Led Zeppelin stopped just short of satanic and disease spraying debauchery (the shark thing notwithstanding) and right before Nirvana made all this [...] seem silly (although I GUARANTEE you that even Rage Against the Machine participated in their share of groupie fondling).    And Guns and Roses only really degenerated for a short period of time before trying to grow up.  So basically, the Crue lived and breathed the worst of sex, drugs, rock n roll that any band possibly could in America.  Plus their home base was Hollywood!  What the [...]!  It is absolutely amazing that they are all still alive.    P.S. Everyone in that band owes Mick Mars a serious apology for [...] with him so much - and they're the ones that admitted being such [...].  Without Mick this band would not have been more popular than Keel or maybe Dokken.   But this is one hell of a good read.
B0099Y2YL6|5|Again superbly done and I wish, only, we didn't have to wait so long for the next season.  two words
0316017930|5|Great read for everyone, gives you a background to a lot of the prime examples of &#34;success&#34; that stand out in our daily lives.
B009T9P7OC|5|its good fo my galaxy note2.<br />i used it trial version and now i get plus version<br />ha ha ah
B002QS1O36|5|Wow what a movie it was amazing!!! This movie literally broke my heart I couldn't sleep for like a week until I looked up an alternative ending on youtube where Christine and the Phantom stay together! Hahaha. I watch it when I feel like having a good cry 8.. (
B00A6PD8RQ|5|This was a great movie to watch.  Loved the graphics and the story!  Did not think I would like a &#34;cartoon&#34; movie, but this was good.
B0019IB0II|5|This book is truly fascinating! I think everyone should understand what goes on with the brain when a person has a stroke.<br />We have a lot of misconceptions about what the victims of strokes experience. Dr. Roth does an incredible job of explaining how the different regions of the brain work and how they become affected. I would definitely recommended this book to anyone that has a loved one that's struggling with the devastating aftermath of a stroke.
B00005JKJA|5|I could watch this DVD 199 times (in a row!) and still not have the puzzle figured out.  Is the whole thing a dream?  All but a few minutes?  Only the first two-thirds?  None?  And what's up with the senior couple?  Or the cowboy?  And whatever it is that lives behind the diner?  And Lee Grant's Louise Bonner:  she's the only character that really knows what's going on, right?<br /><br />I would've flashed up \\"spoiler alert\\" -- but this movie is unspoilable.  This is David Lynch's masterpiece.  I liked \\"Blue Velvet.\\"  I liked the first season of \\"Twin Peaks,\\" but kinda lost interest when it focused too much on the Log Lady in Season Two.  But I lost interest in Lynch after the terrible \\"Wild At Heart.\\"  Nothing David Lynch has done before can prepare you for this.  This is the cinematic equivalent of Bob Beamon's 29ft 2.5in high jump in 1968:  nothing David Lynch has ever done will prepare you for something this extraordinary.<br /><br />What is it about?  L.A.  A city of juxtapositions.  The glitzy and the tawdry.  Success and failure.  Reality and delusion.  The blonde and the brunette.  Innocence and hot girl-on-girl action.  Betty Elms and Diana Selwyn.  What's it really about?  Who knows!  I don't think even David Lynch really knows.  This is an incredible work of art (not all movies are \\"art\\") that will leave you wondering about what you just saw for weeks, months, years, after the fact.
B00I4R5326|5|Had not seen this in awhile.  Always a pleasure to watch.  Has action, romance, a little sci fi, comedy.  Love this movie.
0767817486|5|Some might think that this 1978 film is out of date.  In fact,<BR>not only is it a riveting film, but it is very current. On page A21 of the February 25, 2004 Washington Post in a story entitled &quot;Turkey's Human Rights Record Is Taken to Task,&quot; reporter Nora Boustany writes of hearings on Capitol Hill before the US Congressional Human Rights Caucus that while Turkey now has laws forbidding torture, these laws are not enforced; torture continues in Turkey.  Hence, everyone who cares about human rights should buy this film.
B006LSZECO|4|Fun with lots of twists...right to the very end.
B00IFMHZ58|3|I had never watched the TV show before so I was going in with a clean slate. I can honestly say parts were ok and parts were not so hot. I never felt the logical in solving the mystery. It felt too easy and sort of came out of nowhere. If you were a fan of the TV show, it might be more enjoyable, but for a non-viewer, it was just ok.
0446585025|5|this book is absouluttely histarical i lauphed my ass off and i loved the back of the book and the inside flap thing i am glad i bought it
B0054JZC6E|3|I really like the games they're fun and different they are cool and interesting. but when I cant complete them it gets on my nerves. I hope to get better at it and get more experienced with it.
B001XVCYH2|5|The matrix revolutions is the super-awesome finale to the super-awesome Matrix trilogy. Worth watching over and over and over again.
B005GFPZYK|5|I couldn't put this book down. It was very well written. It makes me appreciate the men and woman fighting for our country so much more. It really is a must read. I didn't realize the extent of the war. It's a great inside look on what's going on over there. This was a very touching story and I will always remember it. I can't wait to see the movie! I can't believe after all he went through he ends up dying from the hands of one of his own. It's really sad.<br />I don't ever write reviews but this book has changed that. Everyone should try to at least look into Chris Kyle he truly is a hero. He put his life on the line to save other's. I can't say enough.
B001M4YZ90|1|i AGREE WITH THE GUY WHO FELL ASLEEP...I KEPT NODDING OFF...I JUST COULDN'T GET INTO IT...NO DISCERNIBLE COHERENT PLOT THAT DRAWS YOU IN...JUST A BUNCH A BITCHES TRYING TO PULL OFF A GANGSTER NOIR  BRITISH ACTION WANNA BE...warped nut-hook, paunchy full-gorged death-token, puking flap-mouthed canker-blossom, rank milk-livered pumpion, , frothy bat-fouling malt-worm, lumpish rump-fed puttock....guts-gripping toilet hugger....etc., etc., etc.  yeah dat's what I'm talkin' bout...
B00QLVY7J2|4|This game is truly addicted
B008OIQYTG|5|Lee gives us great tracks and just enough vocals to balance.
B00005JL7Q|5|First, I adore Hugh Grant.  As soon as i saw the preview I wanted to view this film.  It was simply wonderful.  It's a charming tale of Will, a rich, unemployed singleton who lives off royalties from a song his father wrote.  It takes a young boy to teach him to face the realties of life and that gaining complications helps us grow and expand as individuals. Since viewing the film I read 2 of Nick Hornby's novels, including this one, they are great as well.  The novel matched the film almost to a tee, which made for great reading...I laughed out loud many times!! You will enjoy his candor and yet humourous childishness at the same time.  I am definitely now a fan.
1101946342|5|What can I say.  I loved the fifty trilogy.....and, if you loved Fifty there is no reason for you not to love Grey.  Love Christians POV, and yes it's the same story as book 1 so it's going to cover the same things.  If you didn't like Fifty, chances are you won't like Grey.  It is what it is.  I'm looking forward to the next 2 books.
B00I2TV3NO|4|good movie
006621131X|3|For those readers who are not artists, the memoir Just Kids by Patti Smith is like entering into an alien world. Smith writes with precision and clarity about her life in the 1960s and 1970s when she and Robert Mapplethorpe were friends and lovers and their art was not noticed. The starving artists scenario could have turned out quite differently, and is from the distance of their successes that we can appreciate the uncertainty of their lives when they were young. Smith's voice in this memoir gently brings readers into her relationship with Robert and the people, places and milestones of their lives. It's easy to understand why this book has been praised and has received major awards.<br /><br />Rating: Three-star (Recommended)
B009UX2YAC|3|The game is ok I think it should start out a bit faster. Also, the controls, once you swipe, it takes half a second to recognize the move which makes gameplay very frustrating, but otherwise an awesome game worth playing get it now!
B00AFROVQC|5|\\"A Quest of Heroes\\" follows a young man, Thorgrin, on his dream to become part of the Legion, a specially trained battalion that is under the King's command. Thorgrin finds out that he is different from other people by having a power inside of him; however, he does not know the limits of this new found power of where it even comes from. This is a book of fantasy, heart break, and adventure. While it may not be very long, it is an excellent story that will make you want more!
B003XF1XOQ|5|Great conclusion to the trilogy.  Shows the darker side of the human psyche.
B002E01LL6|5|awesome ty i loved the fast shipping and great price
B0071MV540|2|If you're expecting a slapstick romp with a cast like Eddie Murphy, Ben Stiller and Matt Broderick, this is not it. Yes there are some funny moments and one liners but the overall tone is that of people losing their jobs because someone above them made mistakes. It comes across as too real and a bit sad.
B00AESN8XY|5|Money well spent, fun and edge of your seat excitement!!<br />The necroa virus and neurax worm make the game more of a challenge I CANNOT WAIT FOR THE NEXT TWO MUTATIONS!!
