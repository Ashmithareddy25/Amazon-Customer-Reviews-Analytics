B0017SWPXY|4.0|I am serious people.<br /><br />Enjoyable book, quick read, a little precious and predictable but with a satisfying ending. You don't need to know anyfhing about racing but it would help if you did for some of the descriptions of racing. Employs a beautifully moving central metaphor.
B0093QDGEO|5.0|I loved this movie and haven't met one person that hasn't liked it. It kept me laughing the whole time.
B00A6SZS2Q|5.0|Every decade of rock has its monumental concept epics...the 60's had Sgt. Pepper from the Beatles,the 70's Alice Cooper's Welcome to my Nightmare,the 80's were laced with classics from Iron Maiden like \\"Seventh Son\\",tales from King Diamond,\\"Operation Mindcrime\\" from Queensryche,the 90's had the trilogy of Mr Marilyn Manson's ode to the devious and early 2000's had \\"the Black Parade\\" from My Chemical Romance....and now people u may enter \\"Wretched and Devine\\".  Everything u love about this charismatic quintet with its melodies and anthemic rebellious ways are here and so much more. A battle for self worth and pride flows from each track bleeding angelic beauty with sinister flare...all the while taking us on a spiritual journey of self awareness and personal uprising. Jake Pitts and Jinnx use their duel guitar playing like swords in duel of strength and percission while Ashley Purdy and Christian Coma nail down the bass n rhythm section like a solid tank moving over all in its path..and Andy's lyrics and vocals hit you straight in the pit of ur soul and mesh with your heart and mind evoking emotions u may not have known u had. The guys blend their background vocals and makes that bvb sound u know and love come out in each and every track...In 3 dayz I see this band live and can only imagine if their albums move me what will I experience live...buy this album people. The wild ones have risen for sure and are waiting to have their voices heard.

B005LAII80|4.0|As a life long Sylvester Stallone fan, I'll always enjoy the 90's version. That beind said, \\"Judge Dredd\\" is also very typical from a Stallone action flick of the 80's-90's: from the highly entertaining \\"Cobra\\" and \\"Demolition Man\\" to the god-awful \\"Over the Top,\\" the bulk of Stallone's movies from the 80's-90's are relatively predictable, campy and by the numbers. That's the charm of a Stallone vehicle. I assumed the remake would also be predictable, campy and by the numbers, minus the likeable superstar. Thus, I really had no desire to see it in the theater.  After renting it on Amazon Instant Video, however,  I can safely say I was wrong. \\"Dredd\\" is one of the best action movies I've seen in a long time.<br /><br />I have a hard time calling \\"Dredd\\" a \\"remake,\\" as the storylines are completely different from one another. While it is certainly leaner, meaner, grittier and nastier than the Stallone version, you could easily watch them back to back as two separate adventures of Judge Dredd. The Stallone version, with a bigger budget and larger scale, is much lighter and cheesier; this version is much darker and more serious. In fact, this version can be nightmare inducing and off-putting to softer stomachs with its hardcore violence.<br /><br />Plot in a nutshell: Judge Dredd takes a rookie Judge out into the field for an overall assessment. The two answer a call to investigate a triple homicide in the Peach Tree district (a rough area populated with gangs and killers). The two judges cross paths with a self made drug lord, the ruthless \\"Ma-Ma\\" (wonderfully played by Lena Headley, who is one nasty, scary bitch of a villian), who has the entire complex shut down. Trapped inside with no way of escape, the two Judges must fight for their lives as \\"Ma-Ma\\" orders their immediate demise. If you are familiar with the movie \\"Raid: The Redemption\\" you will notice both storylines are very similar. \\"The Raid\\" is another fantasticly hard core action flick that was released in 2012, where cops are trapped in a building full of killers and crazies attempting to fulfill the bloody demands of a drug kingpin. However, \\"The Raid\\" is much more of a martial arts extravaganza where Dredd concentrates more on violent gun play and amazing visuals that are truly stunning to watch.<br /><br />Speaking of amazing visuals: The visual style of \\"Dredd\\" is wonderful- especially the use of slow motion throughout the film. In fact, the use of slow motion is probably the best I've seen in ANY movie, surpassing even the Matrix or any other film that has taken slow motion to new heights. \\"Slo-Mo\\" also happens to be the name of the drug that Ma-Ma pushes, and the scenes where people are high on \\"Slo-Mo\\" are among the most amazing in the film. From an early scene where Ma-Ma is high while taking a bath to a gun fight between Dredd and a roomful of junkies who are smoking \\"Slo-Mo\\" -- the use of slow motion is absolutely breathtaking to behold.<br /><br />Add an intense industrial / electronic soundtrack, plenty of gore, terrific pace and solid acting from all the major players, \\"Dredd\\" is easily the most overlooked, under-rated action movie of 2012. While the movie flopped at the box office, most critics loved it (currently 77% on Rottentomatoes), as did general audiences (see IMDB.com and all the 4 & 5 star reviews from Amazon).<br /><br />Yes, the plot is simple and the characters aren't deeply developed- This isn't that kind of movie. In fact, the movie is all the better for it. I've never read the comics, so I have no idea how mysterious or developed the character of Dredd is. But for the film's sake, I think the less that is known about him the better. Urban's performance is well done- his Dredd is simultaneously righteous and sociopathic. He constantly seeths with an inner hatred, but at what is never explained: is it the constant ugliness of street violence he's surrounded by? Did something horrible happen in his past? Is he simply a sociopath himself, a killer with a questionable conscience? All of the above? Again, I liked that his character is open to interpretation (if you're nerdy enough like I am to search for deeper meaning in a high energy action film like this- I personally think there's a lot of depth to this movie, which is one reason why it is a critically acclaimed film).<br /><br />If you are looking for highly entertaining hardcore adult action that moves quickly, pulls no punches and takes no prisoners, \\"Dredd\\" delivers in spades.  Hopefully this movie finds new life on video that it did not at the box office, thus warranting future installments in the \\"Dredd\\" franchise (so long as the same makers are involved).

1402756399|5.0|I read this when i was in my 20's but it was the original version. I always loved the book. so interesting. when I saw this version I just had to have it. not disappointed.
B0094OLFUW|4.0|The three best words I can use to describe this album. Each song is unique enough to stand on its own, yet complement each other nicely. The lyrics may bring you down a bit, but I'd be lying if I said this type of music has any other purpose.<br /><br />It feels very raw, poetic, and real which is rare in these over-produced album days we find ourselves in.<br /><br />I wouldn't say it's a perfect album, as after a few listens the repetition got to be a bit much (I think their first album stood up slightly better to repetition), but still a very high quality album.<br /><br />I would recommend this album to anyone who loved their first album, as it is exactly the same style, and will be telling all my friends and family to check it out (which is rare for me to do).
0062231375|4.0|I think with Anthony Bourdain coming soon to network TV and CNN, now is a good time to read this book, if you haven't already.<br /><br />It's 25 years old. At the time of writing he was a lot younger and had a lot less to lose. It's very raw, honest, and funny and some of what he writes might shock you. There is a passage that suggest vegetarians are basically effeminate homosexuals and we should be afraid of getting AIDS from them.<br /><br />It was a different time, and this is clearly a different Anthony. Now he's on TV all the time, and these rough edges have been smoothed out. He has a wife and family and lives on the Upper East Side, he's not a punk writing a first book anymore.<br /><br />But this book is the best thing he's done, and in many ways he's been working his way away from it for 25 years. It reminds us of a time when chefs were not on TV all the time, smiling and chatting pleasantly, muttering catchphrases, and that right now there are chefs serving garbage in expensive restaurants and hate themselves and their customers and still have a lot of punk rock left in them.<br /><br />This review is for the \\"Insider's Edition\\" - the penciled in notes add an extra dimension to the book, without being overbearing.

0525952926|4.0|Now that I was well into the saga, the second book of the trilogy was much easier to get through...and more personal for me as I lived through most of those times. I read this one in hard cover and found the volume quite heavy...propped it up during reading. However, that should not deter anyone from reading it as it is a finger turner. Looking forward to the finale.

It was a good read and by the end, I was anxious to get to the second book in the trilogy.

B003FCMAS0|4.0|We had rented Dr Parnassus for a family movie night, and were blown away by the vibrancy, the color, and the imagination captured in each frame. It truly was an invigorating experience, and had my entire family quiet, openmouthed, and staring at the screen (which trust me, is a feat in and of itself, usually family movie nights are a cacophony of side conversations, laughter, dogs barking, and the movie buzzing in the background). When I saw this &#34;behind the scenes&#34; Prime, I thought it would be a perfect way to wind myself down after a long day at work - I figured I would put it on in the background and clean the house, but ended up sitting down and actually watching it.<br /><br />It's a beautiful behind the scenes look, and I would recommend it to anyone who is a fan of the movie.

1400067820|5.0|Nassim Taleb's \\"Antifragile\\" is one of the most engaging books I've read in years. You should almost certainly make time for it. But if you can't, here is a top-of-mind recap (summarizations asterisked, with further impressions to follow).<br /><br />*Like the porcelain teacup, that which is fragile is harmed by volatility. That which is robust holds up and is thus 'volatility neutral'. That which is 'antifragile' actually benefits from volatility's presence.<br /><br />*The antifragility property only exists up to a point (e.g. modest physical stressors can be good for one's health via triggering the healing and building response - immodest physical stressors, not so much).<br /><br />*Time is the ultimate tester (and breaker) of all things - as such, time equates to volatility. Mother Nature is the master of incremental advancement (biological and societal evolution) through multi-dimensional long run trial and error (serendipitous random tinkering). Fragility in the parts often commutes to heightened antifragility for the system as a whole (e.g. individual humans are fragile, but the gene pool is not; individual restaurants are fragile, but the restaurant business is not).<br /><br />*True sophistication is shunning attempts to predict or \\"know\\" in favor of respect for the limits of knowledge, coupled with wariness of hidden risks and a habit of enlightened tinkering.<br /><br />*Academia deliberately misinterprets the evidence: Wealth and prosperity beget institutions of higher learning, not the other way round. Countries get rich and then build universities - universities do not help countries get rich. Real world practitioners have embedded knowledge that theorizers wrongly take post-hoc credit for (the \\"lecturing birds how to fly\\" effect).<br /><br />*Many \\"Soviet-Harvard\\" type errors come via disregard of time gaps - the delayed distribution  of hidden costs and consequences (mistaking absence of evidence for evidence of absence). Those who suffer from neomania - love of the new - arrogantly assume we can improve on designs we don't truly understand, even when nature has taken centuries, or even millennia, to perfect what clearly works.<br /><br />*The barbell strategy, in which a small percentage of assets are concentrated in high risk, high reward investments, with a majority of assets in ultra-conservative safe harbor cash equivalents, is vastly superior to the higher-than-acceptable risk, lower-than-acceptable reward proposition of the muddled middle. (If you load up on a \\"respectable\\" multi-billion market cap blue chip stock, you might get badly harmed by an asbestos lawsuit or market crash, but your odds of substantial upside are zero).<br /><br />*Because existence is such a non-linear phenomenon - e.g. our hunter gatherer ancestors did not get an \\"average\\" or \\"balanced\\" nutritional intake each day, but rather feasted on some occasions and fasted on others - it bears out that Mother Nature (and thus our ancient biological systems) have intrinsically adapted to this nonlinearity, and even found ways to benefit from it (moderate level stressors strengthen the bones and muscles, random fluctuations in air pressure intake can benefit the lungs etc.).<br /><br />*Key directives: 1) Don't be a sucker; 2) Don't be a turkey.<br /><br />*Iatrogenics, literally interpreted \\"from a physician,\\" refers to the unintended harm (bad side effects) resulting from ill-conceived attempts to heal, e.g. recommending marginal back surgery with greater likely downside than upside. Due to the presence of iatrogenics, low level treatments should generally be avoided (too much risk of downside relative to a small problem), while greater intervention risks should be taken in the event of serious illness (via higher likelihood benefits will outweigh costs).<br /><br />*The principle of \\"via negativa\\" suggests that, in terms of taking action, subtraction often trumps addition because it is so hard to improve on nature's time-tested original(without dilutive side effects). Infant mortality and life-saving surgery aside, the simple exhortation to stop smoking (give up cigarettes) has had more positive health impact than virtually all \\"modern medicine\\" advances of the 20th century.<br /><br />*Optionality is the property of asymmetric upside (preferably unlimited) with correspondingly limited downside (preferably tiny). Optionality can be found everywhere if you know how to look. That which benefits from randomness (increased potential for upside in the presence of fluctuations) is convex. That which is harmed by randomness, concave. Convexity propositions should be embraced - concave ones, avoided like the plague.<br /><br />*The transfer of fragility from one group to another, e.g. banks capturing the upside of speculative activity, then handing taxpayers the bill via bailouts, is morally reprehensible and should be stamped out. The agency problem can be solved by forcing risk takers to have skin in the game. Entrepreneurs, who take serious risks with their own capital, are the true heroes of modern society.<br /><br />*It is not necessarily better to be wealthy than poor. Beyond a certain point, the property of being wealthy (owning \\"stuff\\") morphs from antifragile to fragile (via increased anxiety, expectations / obligations, banal social commitments etc).<br /><br />*Reconsider eating apples and oranges, let alone drinking their concentrated juice, as the sweetness of such is man made - the high sugar content of modern fruit is the result of intensive breeding, with no thought as to what natural (much lower) sugar content ratios our ancient biological systems are adapted to.<br /><br />There is more, but that's the stuff that stuck with me...<br /><br />Re, gestalt impressions of the book, I will risk offending Taleb (not a hard thing to do) by drawing parallels to two other books much enjoyed: \\"How to Get Rich\\" by Felix Dennis and \\"Montaigne: A Life\\" by Sarah Bakewell.<br /><br />\\"How to Get Rich\\" - an excellent read with an awful title - is a funny, biting, brutally honest account of how one real world Brit made his pile. Felix Dennis is a self made entrepreneur (net worth upwards of half a billion) who built his publishing empire with guts and street smarts (rather than the more prosaic higher education, technical genius, pedigree connections etc).<br /><br />Antifragile reminded me of HTGR in that Taleb's book is a sort of field guide for approaching the entrepreneurial world, with the noble goal of getting one's share of \\"f- you money\\" to be set for life and thus free. Roughly speaking, the entrepreneur should behave as follows: Be humble, tenacious, and doggedly experimental; don't trust in experts or academic theory; don't think you know more than you do; and aggressively seek asymmetric payoffs with unlimited potential upside.<br /><br />Antifragile further reminded me of \\"Montaigne: A Life\\" - another wonderful, wonderful book - in that Taleb, like Montaigne centuries before him, articulates an attractively wide-ranging philosophy encompassing \\"how to live\\" almost in total. This is a notable accomplishment.<br /><br />Taleb's message resonates deeply with yours truly for three reasons: First, I was already well exposed to, and predisposed to, the benefits of optionality and asymmetric payoffs; second, I have access to older role models and relatives who have well exploited these (more than one to the tune of $100MM+); and third, because my own business and entrepreneurial life is built around optionality to an extreme degree. (As traders and poker players, we constantly seek out asymmetric upside with defined and limited downside; to give an example, Taleb's discussion of concavity, the undesirable inverse of convexity, is the rough poker equivalent of negative implied odds.)<br /><br />One can clearly see, however, why there would be a large contingent of \\"sour grapes\\" individuals who would take Antifragile as a bitter pill, given the preponderance offragile career paths where upside is capped and volatility only introduces downside (standard journalism one of these?). When one has traded in one's freedom, and possibly one's moral and intellectual integrity, for life in a cage with a trap door, it can be maddening to read about the unfortunate realities of such!<br /><br />I do not mean to sound like a Taleb fanboy, though it feels contrarian to praise him at this point - given how popular it is for the snarky literary mainstream to dogpile on NNT's quirks and \\"cut down the tall poppy\\" as the Aussies say.<br /><br />Unjustified spray hose arrogance - the type that assumes \\"I have X credential or pedigree, so I know everything\\" - is one thing, and certainly deserves light ridicule. Expert-level confidence with defined limits, expressed in a particular domain and earned through excellence, is another. This helps explain why, though I generally detest pomposity, Taleb's prickliness and high-mindedness do not grate. Unlike charlatans and snobbish academics, he is arrogant for acceptable reasons (within a clearly defined domain), with an admirable willingness to make enemies.<br /><br />In conclusion, just as the runaway success of \\"Black Swan\\" was something of a black swan, \\"Antifragile\\" is, all in all, an antifragile tour de force.- an excellent read with an awful title - is a funny, biting, brutally honest account of how one real world Brit made his pile.

0765325950|5.0|From Brandon Sanderson:<br /><br />Question: Why a delayed ebook release for A Memory of Light?<br /><br />Answer: This is not my decision or Tor's decision, but Harriet's. She is uncomfortable with ebooks. Specifically, she worries about ebooks cutting into the hardcover sales. It isn't about money for her, as the monetary difference between the two is negligible here. It is about a worry that her husband's legacy will be undermined if sales are split between ebooks and hardcovers, preventing the last book of the Wheel of Time from hitting number one on either list. (Many of the bestseller lists are still handling ebooks in somewhat awkward ways.)<br /><br />As the last books have all hit number one, she doesn't want to risk one of these not hitting number one, and therefore ending the series on a down note. (Even though each Wheel of Time book has sold more than its predecessor, including the ones I have worked on.) I personally feel her worries are unfounded, and have explained that to her, but it is not my choice and I respect her reasoning for the decision. She is just trying to safeguard Robert Jordan's legacy, and feels this is a very important way she needs to do so. After talking about the issue, we were able to move the ebook up from the originally planned one-year delay to instead come out this spring.

B007HACDLK|5.0|Once again, Mitch Rapp and company take care of business.  The real world scenarios make these books more real than most of us will ever really know.  Keep it it Vince!
B00A9X9ORI|5.0|First off, I'm a HUGE Joe Levitt fan so I automatically love all his work but I was a little skeptical about this one.  I was pleasantly surprised, thank goodness.  Yes, this is technically a Sci-Fi action movie but it's definitely one that is great for date nights.  My husband was a little confused but that's kind of what I liked about it.  You really had to pay attention to the details.  And, of course, JGL did great!
B0055SWM08|5.0|This game is so much fun to play it is difficult at times in yet easy at times it is a great puzzle game if you love puzzles like I do. The music they have the background is very Peaceful and pleasant again this game is worth it if you pay or get it for free.
B001OL4TR4|5.0|I love this movie because of Michelle Pfieffer and Rutgur Haur first of all. They work very welll together and make this movie realistic. Also, I love movies set in this time period where magic abounds. This is one of the most tragically romantic movies I have ever seen.There is also humor that blends well with the more serious aspects. In these type of movies I love that &#34;love&#34; wins over the &#34;evil sorsorer and the lovers have been avenged. I don't normally believe in revenge, per se, but in a movie such as this it is expected. It is heartwarming that the lovers are reunited in the end, I have watched this movie a million times on television when it is available and I am as enthralled each time as if it were the first time viewing,. It,s great I have it now to watch anytime I want! Thank-you,<br />Cherie (Cheryl)
B006OOHYIC|5.0|I have both quell and quell reflect both awesome puzzle games I got 1 for free and then paid for the other 1 it is very much worth it I love it you will too if you like puzzles. Lotsa levels and very worth it I think.
B00A9X9TIW|2.0|The idea and the concept are thought provoking, but the movie itself was yawnsville.<br /><br />Dont waste your time for basic entertainment or because you are a Bruce Willis fan, instead see it because you should make up your own mind. Some have found this movie to be great Sci Fi, but each of us geeks has our own flavor, unfortunately, this one did not match my tastes.
B002BY77CW|4.0|this book is a quick fun read.  The characters are easy to imagine and it is a good book for young adults.
B001ACY8D2|5.0|Always liked the cover of the album.<br /><br />Sounds like a great foreign set of singers. Foreign language doesn't stop the great music from coming through.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|my grandaughter loves purple so this was a great addition to her Kindle Fire HD that she received for Christmas
B001CDD84Y|5.0|Love the way Prime Amazon made this a gift item cheaply.<br /><br />Great fun for people who like the Star Wars Actors.<br /><br />Internet shopping for vacation destinations should be as fun as the main character could open a \\"bank account\\".
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Unfortunately, I didn't know about this series when it started.  My parents started watching it and were hooked so I decided I must check it out.  I have almost completely caught up on the first 2 seasons in a matter of a a couple of days.  I am that hooked.  I am afraid once I do get caught up I will have a hard time waiting for the weekly installation of the show.  I've gotten used to watching one after the other.  I love the characters, the costumes, the scenery, everything is fabulous and now I want to visit the house someday!
B00ATPVA78|4.0|This is a great game for the kindle fire. A great story line line and the graphics are great. Love the puzzles and would highly recommend this game.
B004SBS8LA|2.0|Where's the recent update? Google play has the most recent update, and you have no update for paid version.  Get it together amazon
B000W7JWUA|5.0|My daughter requested this game for Christmas. I had never heard of it, but it is evidently the &#34;fad&#34; game among her friends at college. She is very pleased!
B000AP04NI|5.0|On the VUDU site you can see it in HDX 1080p!!! Looks Great!!! I hope this is seen by people who got the DVD and were disapponted by it.
B001D0DQUC|3.0|As Neil Diamond said, &#34;I've never been a man who likes to swear.&#34; Profanity is part of going to the movies, but I'd forgot how much 80s movies swear non-stop. I watched Ferris with my 16 year old daughter and enjoyed it very much. She it was on of those movies she wanted to see because there are so many references to it. Other than the profanity, which was mild, yet constant, it was a fun story.
B009POCG0Y|1.0|You know, I love good movies!  This movie however, is not one of them.  It is both non-sensical and a poor vehicle for Matthew's career.  To me, it doesn't quite rise to 'B' quality.  Another reviewer suggested a 'cult' following.  Don't get me wrong, I like some edge in my movies...edge is good, very good.  But, it has to be realistic edge.  The only reason anyone is purchasing this movie is because of the cast.  Remove Matthew and the film would generate less interest than a sequel to 'Zombie Strippers'.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|This book was the basis for the movie, Lincoln.  I've only read part of it so far, but it's excellent.  Easier to read than most history books...more like a novel.  And it's fascinating to learn about the interplay among Lincoln and his cabinet members.
071815892X|5.0|It is fun and easy to understand...Has a lot of different delicious recipes...You should try it, believe me...you won't regret it...
B0050PYNO4|4.0|not terribly cerebral, but it tickled my funnybone...silly humor, impossible & implausible situations...but pretty funny just the same...also has a pair of up-and-coming british actors
0765325950|5.0|I ordered this book months ago from Amazon. It has not shipped yet so how are all these people reviewing it? Amazon indicates I should get it within days. I think Sanderson has done a good job so far finishing the series and sure, we all felt such loss when Jordan died (selfishly I just thought about the lack of story end).<br /><br />As to all the people giving bad ratings just for the e-book reasons, let me say I have a Kindle and while I enjoy the convenience when reading \\"small\\" works that don't superbly pull me in to the story...a story like WOT demands the feel of REAL writing! The feel, smell, and ownership satisfaction of a BOOK! I have all these books in hardcover for my library and will treasure sure classics and hand down to future generations to appreciate such story-telling.<br /><br />An e-version of the WOT seems so ghetto to me! It is comparable to the boxed version of wine...volume but no class. Feel it, taste it, see it, meld all the senses to to not only enjoyment but also an appreciation for the art. As it was intended.
B005SFS4ZU|5.0|this has got to be the closest to seeing the play onstage...the movie is very elaborate and the acting good, but this stage version really brings home the stage...and i've seen it onstage in several different places no less than 6 times, so i can really appreciate all the actors...and i LOVED every minute of this production!  i would highly recommend this to anyone wanting the theater experience
B00APUYN0I|5.0|We watched this movie two time, it was that good! If you have not seen this, please watch it. At first I didn't really want to even rent it, but I have it a go. I am very glad I did so.
B002VPE1AW|5.0|Got this for my father and we watched it twice, the visuals are stunning and the sound through the surround sound was outstanding, the movie showed great!!!! loved it!!!!!
B0087ZG7FC|5.0|I haven't looked at or purchased a blue ray in a long time and was really surprised at how affordable it was. It was a gift for my husband and he loved it!
B005G4TJUC|5.0|I bought this also for my dad and the quality is superb, the movie showed flawless and he has watched it at the very least 15 times
B00A1U2SVS|3.0|It is a historic event that these icons reunited however, the music on this cd has a complete different deliverance when accompanied by the video. I saw the video first and then bought the cd. It was kind of sterile. Fantastic, non the less.
0765325950|5.0|The Eye of the World came out in 1990. I was a teenager, and I remember reading \\"This could be going somewhere\\", but I never imagined what I had in store for me.<br /><br />The word \\"Epic\\" is overused, as Thom rightly pointed out. So I'll take his term for it all...<br /><br />Majestic.<br /><br />This was a majestic end to the most intriguing fantasy series ever written.<br /><br />As I read the last page, I said \\"Not what I expected. But that works.\\" to myself. It was a worthy way of wrapping up the series, and my hat is off to Mr. Sanderson, for finishing what Mr. Jordan has started.<br /><br />Ignore the people who complain about the length of the series. Ignore the people who complain about the lack of immediate digital version. If you're a true fan, this book is most likely already in your hands, and you know exactly what I mean regarding the above.<br /><br />And if you're not a fan yet, I envy you, because you have quite a remarkable journey ahead of you. Get a copy of the first book. It will lead you to the second, and the third, and so on, and so forth, until you've read this one as well. And then you, too, will agree with me.<br /><br />Majestic. There's simply no other spoiler-free way to describe this book.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Loved the book. Exciting, a love story, and a dramatic ending! It has lots of action. I liked that about it.
B003EI2EH2|5.0|Not only do the ideas in this book work (at least the ones I've tried), even if you do nothing but read and never try a damned thing, you will be thoroughly entertained.  It's just fun to read about all the different experiments Ferriss has done to himself, along with whatever others have tried.<br />But if you dedicate yourself to the diet, and really it doesn't take much dedication (in fact it's incredibly easy), you will be rewarded.  Not only with a slimmer figure, but in my case (and my girlfriend's), a new found perspective on my relationship with food.<br />I went from being hungry most of the time (cereal for breakfast, hungry two hours later; snack, hungry one-two hours later; etc.), to just feeling good all the time.  I'm no longer hungry between meals and no longer crave the things I'm not having (because I get whatever I want on cheat day).  I have plenty of energy, never get headaches, and eat to fuel my body; not to gorge on some sugar/carb/crap foodstuff.<br />Not only this, but shopping is super fast (literally I'm in the store no longer than 15 minutes), relatively cheap for even organic ingredients (especially if you don't drink wine... oops that's not me), and cooking is extremely easy and quick.<br /><br />Even if you don't do anything else in the book, it's worth for the simple version of the diet alone.  And it's a great read to boot!
0765325950|5.0|Drop the bad reviews, they are not reviewing the book they are lamenting the delayed ebook release.  Every single 1 star review is only because there is not a digital copy yet.  Want to give negative feedback on it then send the publishers an e-mail or letter.  Save the whining and negative feedback for after you read the book (if there is any).  If you were truly fans of the series then you wouldn't bring the ratings of this book down in such a manner.  I am giving it 5 stars to help offset the inconsistent rating.
B000002MY3|5.0|gooos item a great cd with lost of good song to listten to will shop again in your store thanks
B002RI97O8|5.0|This is where reading started for me, the book that first awakened me to the amazing potential of books. So when I read it to my 5 year old recently, I was delighted that the same magic happened for him. Dahl is the master of macabre and suspense, and this is nowhere better displayed than in Mr Fox.<br /><br />The story is quite short, at about 100 pages, so suitable for bedtime reading over a few nights. The only caution is that it does mention dying and killing and is not ideal for a very young audience as it is a little too scary.
B000002MUN|4.0|Great item
B008D19WBQ|5.0|I got this from someplace else, and I have to say, picture quality is just stunning compared to what we got in the DVDs. Also the box that it comes in is very nice. The box comes with a big book for storing all the discs included, and also comes with a booklet that serves as an episode guide and has some very neat pics of random stuff (for example, Ross's proposal ring for Rachel on season 9).<br /><br />If you are a show fan from back when the show was airing, you'll love this set. It includes all the original NBC aired episodes.
B009NQKPUW|5.0|This movie was fun to watch. there was a lot of suspense in the movie and a few plot twists. i recommend watching it
B003Y059EK|5.0|Loved enjoying this movie with my daughter - such great memories from childhood ! I always was facinated by the lunch pail tree ! = )
B00ARAO720|4.0|Great movie for bicycle enthusiasts. Don't try this at home, you can get hurt. Like Gone in 60 seconds for bicycles.
B001CTDH4Y|5.0|If you like the buddies movies and Beethoven, you will like the Chihuahua movies. This is the beginning of the whole trilogy and as a parent you must buy all three. These movies are actually offer enough comic relief for adults to tolerate and enjoy with their children.
B004LWZWGA|5.0|This was a fantastic sequel to the Dark Knight. They really did a great job preserving the mood of the last movie but coming with a new conflict.<br /><br />Bane is one of my favorite movie characters of all time. Very eerie but totally awesome.<br /><br />I also got a great price on the DVD/Ultraviolet pretty soon after the movie was released in theaters.<br /><br />Extremely satisfied.
B000B8QF00|5.0|This is by far the best album by Alanis Morissette, hand down...or is it hands clean : ) This album offers several of her well known hits as well as offers up some new titles that present her life's journey; as everyone knows she writes about her life though her music.
B0066WJLU6|2.0|This is one I've dumped already.  Tried it and found that it was not what I thought it would be.  Lights too small of an area for my purposes.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Even better than the First Season. Plotlines seem more tied together and the performances are better!!! If you liked the first season definitely get this one.
1439152802|2.0|First read Kate Morton's \\"Distant Hours\\" and a cantputitdown read. Naturally I wanted to read something else and become equally involved but this \\"The Secret Keeper\\" was hugely disappointing. I struggled with the beginning expecting things to pick up and wondering when. Then I found it was becoming simply too labor intensive ~ and despite reviews here that claim the book picks up at the end ~ I wasn't prepared to give it more of my time. I'll try some of Kate's other works ~ hopefully I'll enjoy those as much as I did the first one. My recommendation is to avoid this book if it is your first introduction to her writing.
B005Q1W0ZQ|3.0|After watching we found we were missing the final episode.  That is like not getting the last chapter of the book!
B009CG29RK|5.0|This movies is beyond cute and a real feel good movie!  Downloaded to my Kindle Fire HD and the picture is amazing!
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|Cool<br />That funny hilarious book.<br />Read this book you will laugh a good laugh about it.<br />Book review by Adam
B005WYFLNU|5.0|My 4 year old daughter and I really enjoy this product, and its a great price.  Easy to reposition, I did help her take them off the sheet to start with...bright colors, love that it is reusable and easily manipulated for her. Totally recommend. A great thing to share with your child. They may need a bit of help, but that's half the fun, right? Having mommy play with you? ;)
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|First app I downloaded on my kindle fire and I must say it's great !!!!! Would recommend to any other kindle fire owners!!!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Coin drop !!! LOVE it, this and the Claw are the best games ever! I play all the time. Great for just a \\"let me brain purge\\" time!
B00AKL1XPU|1.0|The game was really fun in the beginning but then it decided not to open when I go back In it keeps force closing. Not recommended for the kindle fire
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|I didn't expect the ending to go like that.....but I enjoyed the movie. Bruce Wills did a good job playing a different role
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|I have read all of their books up to this and it is so refreshing that they can surprise me like they have with this story. Great book!
B000002AGN|5.0|The year 1959 and this is one of two albums that transformed Jazz. It's well worth the money invested to hear it if you've never done that just to understand the diversity of Jazz that was happening in the late 50's.
0670026182|5.0|It's just a nice book and has a lot of things that are doable.  It's one of my favorite books.
B000002ADT|5.0|One of two classic Jazz albums recorded in 1959 that transformed Jazz. It's well worth hearing if you've never heard it before.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Way to hard to put down. I have been playing for a few days now and I still can't stop.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|The best season ever of the best show ever.<br />What can I say, Sam & Dean rock !<br />I'd like to see more of the Vampires though Their unique design chills my soul...lol.
B007MJSYF0|3.0|Don't get me wrong I found this interesting enough to sit through all of this subtitled movie, but it was after all a great deal like hunger games with a Japanese twist.  In the near future the Japanese are fed up with revolting students and create a law to deal with them.  Of course in this case most of the students are innocent but that doesn't seem to matter.  They choose a class of about 70 students and send them off to kill each other on a remote island.  Each gets a pack with food and a weapon.  Some of those weapons are a pair of binoculars and another a pot lid.  However some get numbchucks, knifes, and even pistols and machine guns.  Now if you like either Japanese movies or other cultural movies, you will probably enjoy this movie.  The movie is pretty decent most of the time, but like most movies of this type they get cheesy, hammy, and generally full of themselves preaching mistakes of society, how students and teachers are treated, and kids just don't appreciate what they have from time to time.  It is worth a rental in my opinion. If you enjoy it and haven't seen [[ASIN:B008602KQI The Hunger Games]] or the  classic [[ASIN:B004D2E598 Lord of the Flies]] be sure to see them.<br /><br />CA Luster
0765325950|1.0|Wow, the long awaited final copy!  Unfortunately for Brandon Sanderson, a really great author, either Tor or Harriet McDougal, have screwed him out of royalties.  Does Tor/McDougal really think that the NYT best seller's list for this book, which it will likely achieve ebook or no, is worth the revenue that will be lost??  Does anyone besides them really believe that there won't be an electronic copy of this available within two weeks, months ahead of the for-purchase release?<br /><br />If I could buy this as an ebook today, I would.  Since I can't, I will likely never pay for it.  Sorry Brandon.  Get a new publisher or never let an estate dictate release terms.  You, unfortunately, are the one who will suffer most.
B00A9X9ORI|3.0|Well even from the ads you know there is a paradox.  Do you kill your future self or not?  The movie centers around a mostly wealthy or content society with an element of mafia style enforcement to prevent future people coming back and changing things.  The assassins that deal with them know when and where they will appear and when they arrive they are tied and head bagged to prevent identity before execution.  The flaw in the system is sometimes an assassin lets their future self go.  The precedent for that happening is to make the future self wish they were dead as fingers, and other things start to disappear on them.  Certainly worth a rental if you like SciFi or Action movies.  If you enjoyed it see [[ASIN:B00177Y9ZC Jumper]] and [[ASIN:B004BEMC6G Salt]].<br /><br />CA Luster
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book was very funny and edition of adventurer<br />Hayden is a boss<br /><br />ELite<br />GOML<br /><br />Ps in a boss lab.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|I am ADD.  So if it grabs my attention and holds it, that's quite the accomplishment.  HA!  I love the whole idea of hearing the rest of the story and bringing the characters to modern time.  Brilliant!  The acting is superb.  The show would be sorely lacking without the sets, costuming and makeup which give it life.  I am impressed with this work of art.  Thank you so much for all of your hard work.  I so enjoy every episode.
B001GMH8TM|5.0|Sometimes one wishes to get away to a world that is innocent and sweet.  This movie let's you experience what that may be like and offers some twists along the way... great if you enjoy suspending your beliefs and getting lost in &#34;what if&#34; questions.
B009RI4FRU|4.0|Really enjoyed the movie.  Fun story and good acting.  Quite a few major actors in downplayed roles. Would recommend viewing.
0765325950|5.0|This was a fantastic and exciting read.  Sanderson did a masterful job in concluding this epic series without losing the feel of Robert Jordan.  The Book is long but entirely action packed...no words are wasted describing clothes or room furniture in this one folks.<br /><br />My favorite part was when the Dark One was finally revealed to be an angry,  bitter ebook user who had been incesantly whinning away for thousands of years about his favorite book not being available right away as an ebook when it was published right before the Breaking.
B00APUYWYA|3.0|no, really too many DULL spots, had some funny moments, but too few and far between, almost took it out
B004EPYZUI|3.0|Not as good as I remember it when I first saw it lol. Kind of drags after that amazing first fight scene.

B001KVZ6G6|5.0|Have you heard the joke &#34;Pixar made a more powerfully emotional movie in the first 10 minutes of UP than the entire Twilight saga put together&#34;? SO true! Not only is this an adorable movie about unlikely friends taking a harrowing journey in a fantastic environment, it's a journey of the imagination all lifestyles and ages enjoy. Truly! Goth metal heads enjoy the humor, my grandparents find the elderly curmudgeon charming and I love all the bright colors and direction.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|This game is fast and very hard to beat even on the easy setting a lot can be learned play!!!
B007P7UF0G|1.0|I am sure it is something to do with my DVR as I tried it on another HD DVR and I could hear the words that are sung and spoken. However, I have not been able to do so on mine. I have never had this problem with a DVD before. Sorry for the negative review.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|A Must read for all.  This will open up your mind and bring you closer to some one you trust.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|keeps you wanting to keep playing<br />definitely something that will pass the time<br /> while waiting at appointments for the doctor
B00A757EFW|1.0|Never got this!!!  Still waiting, would like to have.<br />This looks like a fun game I would like to have it
B00AS1Q8FW|1.0|Yet another movie that Tom Cruise has been allowed to slaughter. What was the director thinking? This really would have been a good movie. However, I just cannot get over his acting.<br /><br />0 Stars. Not worth your money or your time.
0064430227|5.0|This is one of my daughter's favorite books. I think it's clever because it's a little boy that creates his own world using just a crayon and his imagination. A must for any library!
B003F46RVO|1.0|I went into this movie expecting a decent 80's Horror, Vampire, what have you.<br />The reason I gave this only 1 star is to balance it from all the other reviews from people who haven't seen 80's teen horror movies.  If you're looking for a good Vampire movie from the 80's check out Fright Night (it was good enough that they tried a remake...which doesn't do the original justice).<br /><br />Watching this movie with a friend, we saw all the 80's cliches but so much was missing that other 80's movies had.  This movie felt like it was at a Pumpkinhead sort of level (hopefully I didn't offend any Pumpkinhead fans).<br /><br />In short, this was a Coreys movie that somehow got some kind of following of people who don't know good movies.<br />You've even got Kiefer in this movie playing the same character he plays in every other movie, the ass hole.<br /><br />If you want to see a better movie with Kiefer playing the ass hole and only one Corey, watch Stand By Me.<br />and check out Fright Night (even the remake was better than this).
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Love this book! Took me back twenty years to that age when your finding out who you are. Must read!!
B0053O89KG|5.0|This is a great drama to get addictive to. It keeps you on the edge of your seat guessing throughout each episode.If you love drama and comedy, this is the show to watch.
B0055S348W|5.0|First, I can't believe this is even possible now. I got this app and was skeptical. But once I connected it to my wireless printer(which was very easy), it absolutely works as advertised. Nobody could believe I was printing anything I wanted from my phone. It comes in especially handy on a professional level as well. Great work!
0316223239|5.0|To be immersed for a few days in the head of a precocious and inquisitive 5 year old who questions the meaning of words and the world around him is the invaluable gift given by Emma Donaghue in her book, Room.  I will miss being with Jack and his Ma.  They taught me to think about how we box ourselves into our lives in so many ways.  Thank you, Emma Donoghue for opening the door to a higher level of living wherever you are.  A book for people of all ages.
B0036TGT3E|5.0|This movie was a long time coming for me on Blu-Ray. I couldn't have wanted more. Disney has done an exceptional job in every aspect of bringing my favorite animated film to HD. Giving the film the respect it deserves. All the colors and detail pop and with the sound as quite something to behold. From the rumbles of the stampede to the crispness of every lyric and beat of each song. Once again, well done Disney! Just waiting for Aladdin this spring! (What are YOU talking about? hehe)
0765325950|5.0|The book is awesome. Exactly what I was wanting in it and I'm only 150 pages through. I wish I re-read a few of the other ones but it is great and I have loved reading it so far. I have a kindle but a book like this shouldn't be read on a kindle, along with all the other books from this series. It's just too good.
B0099G6Q5E|4.0|They only problem I have with this Soundtrack is the songs were re recorded in studio and not the exact songs from the movie.  Wish I could get the movie versions of some of the songs.
B009VA1FN6|4.0|Same structure as other Kate Morton books however this means you are hooked from the very beginning and her knack for sharing only a little bit of detail at a time keeps you flying through the novel.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|This was an enjoyable book. A good read. It kept my attention from start to finish, however there were a number plot elements that just were not plausible and thus detracted from the experience
B0091REZMW|3.0|Not bad at all, can become very addictive. Requires too much jewels cor regular play though.<br />The energy needed to investigate each room is way too much.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Interesting read! Kept me interested and wasn't just wild action but a theory that kept my interest.  Be sure to add this to your must read list.
B0092MKFIY|5.0|You can put this album on and listen to it all the way through. All of the songs are great, you will not be buying it only for the hits you hear on the radio.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|This book was quite interesting especially for someone planning on joining the military. It gives some very personal insight on how the military can effect your family life.
B001GZ6QBU|5.0|great movie action and adventure i loved this movie lots of nice nice nice action u will love this movie
B008KE3960|3.0|Okay, my kids love this. They thought it was the best thing ever. I, however, hate it! Both of my sons have parental locks to prevent purchases without a pin, as well as my amazon account having it, but guess what?! This game has a glitch where they can just keep buying and buying and buying in app purchases at 19.99 a piece.  It almost seems like an intentional glitch! Luckily, the issue is so well known that amazon credited me back everything that slipped through the parental controls and I put a video up on youtube showing how it passes through parental controls, showing how that they are active and this still allows it, I figured it was worth a little bit to show people I was not tech retarded and that it was a legitimate glitch. Then I promptly deleted it. I tested the other games for purchases and the code came up 2 times, one tablet based and one amazon, requiring parental pin so it is just this game! shady.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|this was a gift for my daughter and she was so happy when she opened her present on christmas day and all of us watched the movies good movies.
B000P0J09W|5.0|FAMILY FUN MOVIE!!  WE ALL ENJOYED IT VERY MUCH.  I WATCHED WITH MY CHILDREN AND NOW WATCHING WITH MY GRANCHILDERN.
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|People keep knocking Russel Crowe's performance, but I don't think it was bad. His voice has more of a rockin sounds, but it was still good. Hugh Jackman and Ann Hathaway are AMAZING!!!
B009GIPDQS|2.0|Disappointing read with the author trying far too hard to be cute. The initial idea was fine but the execution left much to be desired. I expect better from Mr Grisham and wonder if he might now have written enough.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Good story.  The book does drag on some in the beginning.  It does finish better then it starts.<br />Nice finish to the series
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|This true story is why you never give up on someone who has taken a wrong turn in life.  We can be so much bigger than our mistakes.  Adam Brown proves himself to be a real man, husband, father, and patriot in this gripping story of redemption.  Inspirational!
B001U9BRNE|5.0|One of the best musicians in the world. And producer.<br />Price was very good.<br />I received it in perfect conditions.
B007HGPBRC|5.0|An excellent book about a subject that most of us do not wish to acknowledge.  He is so logical it is quite uplifting to hear his words of hope and fear especially in a time when we don't seem to have time to talk about important things.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Absolutely couldn't put it down! Grab some Kleenex! There's never a dull moment and full of surprises! Just love it!
0316010669|5.0|Changed the way I view the word! Malcolm Gladwell is a great author and this is exactly the quality I expected from him.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Very good didn't want to put it down. One of Stevens better books. Pick this one up for a good read
B0091REZMW|4.0|This is a fun game. just a little bit repetitive!  I don't like that you have to buy more diamonds (currency) when you mysteriously run out,  so that you can keep playing. I played then ran out,  I thought that it was something that I had done,  so I uninstalled then reinstalled but ran out again! so I think I am done because I am not going to spend cash!!!
B00A17AD36|5.0|I am so happy that I bought this! Words cannot explain how addicted I am to this music! The Weeknd is officially one of my favorites :)
B003FSTN7A|5.0|I loved the natural element to the Medium. Allison Dubois is a working mother with all the stresses and problems<br />that naturally come with juggling a household and a career. Plus, she has the extra element of a special psychic ability to<br />contend with, that at times wreak havoc in her life.She continually battles with the nature of her &#34;gift&#34; and how to help others but<br />yet keeping it manageable ,so she and her family can live a normal life.<br />These episodes were especially interesting because she also battles physical illness and surgery.There is a moment that she fears she has lost her gift and the question becomes is that such a bad thing???? Whether you are an avid medium watcher or a new comer this season will not disappoint!
B003YL4LYI|4.0|The books are good, except for certain characters dying once you really get into them. I'm half expecting at the end of this for the others to win; I would not put it pass the writer to do that. If he is trying to show how real life his books are by knocking off main characters all the time well then I just want to say that I read fiction books because I want to take a break from real life for a moment.
B004V2S4SS|5.0|This series last installment was a welcome surprise. Sometimes shows get too exaggerated or over done at the end. In this genre, especially ,it usually is more likely to try and pull out all the stops. The series kept the integrity of the shows premise until the very end. Of course, the premise is one of the paranormal, so you are a bit beyond the boundaries already.<br />However, the attempt to leave the show with the same intrigue, family bonding in even tough times, splashed with a bit of an emotional roller coaster of events leaves the avid medium watcher asking why did the series ever have to end?
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|Never have I seen a movie this original. Sure there are some problems, but they are so small that it's easy to let go.
B0049JPU8A|5.0|Even though this isn't their latest album out, it has some great songs and well worth buying the entire CD.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Super fun games of solitaire. Love playing on my Kindle. I would recommend to anyone who likes games that challenge them.
B002SEW5WW|5.0|Even though this isn't their latest release, it has a lot of great songs and is well worth buying the CD!
B005CW4U2K|1.0|Be warned, I did not read carefully the downgrades rates related with this faulty DVD, it just stoped after 15 minutes or so and went back to main menu, it looped permanently....my only high point would be that it is now out of stock...so hopefully no more people would be stuck with this expensive frisbee... :(
B0014D6PCO|5.0|First time seeing it. Saw The Dark Knight Rises and wanted to see how it all began and loved it.
1608871517|5.0|I got my signed copy indirectly from the author. I have a strong interest in Michael Jackson fastions and his style. You not going to find anything remotely this indepth and well written, so well pictured then this book Mr. Bush did. Jackson was a master of many things and his original creation he wanted was detail very good in the book. Dennis Thompkins and Michaal Bush created the iconic work of wearable fashion fine art ever done. It without question these works should be framed and placed next to the masters of comtemporary art. The cost and pain detail and all hand made everyone. He was MJ close friend and Costume Director on many tours and was the one who was choose to dress him when he died for the wake. It blows you mind. For your information the designers sold their Michael Jackson collection at Julian's Action house on 12/2/12 and many of the items in the book show up in the sale. If you wonder what was paid for them go to the auction house site and look up he sale. The cover of the catolog is the same and also worth a pick up. This book it a very nice homage to Michael. We all know his music, but his legency Mr Bush help to create.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|We can't wait for the next season.  So hooked on this show.  Can't imagine the characters being any better than the way they have this thing cast.  My heart actually races when I watch some of these episodes.  Yes, it's that good.
B00ARAO720|2.0|When your husband walks out, you know there is a problem. The bike stunts can not save a really lame movie.
B008QE9VJI|5.0|Loved the movie and received just in time for xmas.  It was a great gift to add to a Depp collection.
B00AEFVRB2|4.0|Matthew really can act!  Movie where everyone is screwed up.  crazy story, that we found well acted, and entertaining. This was more my speed then magic mike.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I LOVED THIS BOOK and can't wait to read the next one in the Hunger Games series. It really was a great read!
B0067TQQI8|5.0|This is a great little product.  Charging the battery itself seemed to be a bit slow (but it came 3/4 full anyway so was useful out of the box).  Is smaller than any portable hard drive & has all the adapters you might need (except lightning) so you don't even have to have your cords with you.  Comes in a great little mesh carrying case with a draw string fastener.
B0092MKTL2|5.0|I was felt some trepidation about buying a whole CD/Album because I liked snippets of 2 songs, but I used my gift card and made the leap and I'm so glad I did! This is so great - it reminds me a little bit of Owl City meets Muse meets One Republic...just pure spiff-tacular-ness! I was drawn in by &#34;It's Time&#34; & &#34;Radioactive&#34;, of course, but I love literally every song, so this was definitely worth the money!
B00AE2I4WK|5.0|The dancing in this movie was awesome, and I love love LOVE that they incorporated the LXD and previous Step-Up dancers. Acting was okay-ish, but that's not why I watched the movie. All of the step up movies go crazy with the dance, which is the point, and it's fantastic.<br /><br />The quality of the streaming was kinda crappy. Especially at the end where it was pixelated.
B004RC8NXI|4.0|Got this for my daughter she said it was good,  I didn't watch it so have no idea how good it really is
B007DIQAXI|5.0|Purchased for my daughter for Christmas.  She loves this band and is looking for other similar albums.  The record was in excellent condition and was shipped quickly.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a great game for increasing your strategy level and making you use your brain. My husband enjoys it very much also
B007885IJU|5.0|Purchased for my daughter for Christmas.  She loves this band and is looking for other similar albums.  The record was in excellent condition and was shipped quickly.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Ran out of books to read in sci fi and this was 99 cents, and easily one of the best books I've read this year
B004UBB3KQ|5.0|Purchased for my daughter for Christmas.  She loves this band and is looking for other similar albums.  The record was in excellent condition and was shipped quickly.
0765325950|3.0|I know everyone is complaining that TOR should have released an e-book the same time as the paper and audio version, I am disappointed as well.  We all have been waiting for the January release of the final book only to find out our preferred format is not included, I personally choose an e-reader because my vision no longer allows me to read small print, and my Kindle allows me to adjust my text size so that I can still enjoy one of my favorite pastimes.  So, since I can't do anything about it, and I have waited this long, I guess another 4 months really doesn't matter.
B001NLL93W|5.0|I couldn't put any of the books in this series down. I was very impressed with the writing and with the fresh new idea. Excellent.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I read the Hunger Games trilogy and recommend it for adults as well as teens.  I was reluctant to read the books as the premise of children being pitted against one another to the death for the enjoyment of a dysfunctional society was not appealing to me.  BUT read I did and from the very first book felt there was a strong underlying message about buildinmg character, integrity and determining what is right and what is wrong.  By the end of the third book  the author conveys a strong anti-war message reinforcing war is inhumane and never the way to settle differences.
0307346617|5.0|book was better than the copy I bought in store! Clean smell and tight bind. I would make future orders.
B004QL7K70|4.0|Asked for this movie for Christmas and so I said sure! And it arrived way before Christmas and was wrapped under the tree! Great service!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This story was completely different than what I thought it would be. I loved the story between Peers and Kitness, how he truly loves her and she thought he knew it was for show. Now I can watch the movie and hopefully it's just as good. Then, on to book 2.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|Buying a Taylor Swift album goes against every fiber of my living being......But I bought it for a Christmas for my Niece. She was very happy, so therefore so am I.
B009J2VR3Y|3.0|CD case was cracked upon arrival and it was a x-mas gift so there was no time for a return.
B000Z27HLS|5.0|I love Jane Austen and just added this to my DVD collection. It is a fun take on the story.
1416914285|5.0|This book was great I loved the story and can't wait to read the next one they can only get better with time...
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I have a kindle fire and it works great so far.  It is exactly what it says it is and I would defiantly recommend it to anyone with a kindle fire or any thing else.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I like the app. Easy to play, easy to understand and easy to follow. I like that there are many different layouts, unlike other Mahjong games. Also it never crashes!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I thought  that Mockingjay was an amazing book... except for the ending, I thought it was little too  sad to have prim die, Gale not comeback, and have Katniss's mother work in another district. But overall it was Anamazingbook
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|great game. great graphics. entertaining storyline. wish there were more like this. I would recommend the full version to anyone.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|Amazing. As usual. I couldn't put it down. I can't wait to read the other books! Definitely worth every penny!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|My review may be a little partial, because I love Downton Abbey!  I love the characters and like that the plot moves on a larger timeline than many shows.  The cinematography is wonderful.  Everything about it is a delight to watch.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I really enjoyed reading it (again) it is very deep and has a lot of messages, with out being to cheesy. It is one of the few books that I have read (along with \\"Paper Towns\\" by John Green) that I think inspires those who read it to go out, write a novel and really do something amazing with your life.
B002R0F3Q2|5.0|thank god for her parents. this is one of the greatest artists of my time, and i'm pushing 70. hope to be around for some more good music.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Best game ever because it is the classical minecraft we all know and love just three things it needs : armor ,potions,and the actual nether
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I love the graphics and feel if the game.  I would have fin with 5 stars if it didn't get you hooked fir free than make you pay to continue.  I like trial games but I like knowing it's a trial ahead if time.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Breaking in convention with the typical pulp SF tales of his day, Card crafted a fascinating piece of speculative fiction that is both thoughtful and quite entertaining. While this novel does not focus on the cultural or social aspects of the alien invaders, the trade-off for meaningful, well-written human characters is refreshing. If action is not your forte when reading a SF novel, than Ender can be a drag at times, but the detailed glimpses into Andrew's mind will easily satisfy the reader searching for a more introspective SF novel.
B001LF347E|4.0|Bought this for a family member and she just loves this series.  she has already requested the rest as future gifts
B003O86FMW|5.0|It's an awesome book. everybody should read it. I couldn't take my eyes off the book. I definitely recommend it for other people t to read.
B001AQR39O|5.0|I enjoyed this series.  It is worth the money.  If you are looking for a good series to get into, this won't disappoint you!
B006LSZECO|3.0|This book was well written and gave a twisted yet eerie, pretty dam close to real relationships point of view in an entertaining and grab your interest story.
0765325950|4.0|My favorite part: bringing back Hinderstap.  Completely unexpected.  That was the hardest I ever laughed from a book.<br /><br />I loved how the last Battle brought all the characters together.  Truly, humanity uniting to fight against the Shadow.  However, Rand's battle with the Dark One and the end of a certain other villain almost at the very end was not satisfying.
0061124958|5.0|I bought this for my youngest granddaughter.  I have read this to my two daughters and my two older grandddaughters.  It's a family tradition.  A beautiful story.
B008KWHM6U|3.0|That's not to say it is not a decent CD. It's just not a 5 star like their last album.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I read a short review of this book in the Sunday NYTimes Book Section -<br />and something struck me.  Don't think I had high expectations; but I'd recently read \\"A Second Wind\\" - the story which inspired the movie, The Intouchables. - also about a quadriplegic  . .so I tried a sample on my Kindle.<br /><br />You know how some books just hook you right in from the first page?  While with others - often well-reviewed - you just struggle and struggle, hoping to get to the point of \\"not-putdownable\\".  This book had me from the very beginning. . .not so much the plot but something very come-hither about the writing.  Moyes' writing is accessible; she writes well - uses a good combination (for me) of dialog and description.  The first person voice works well for her main character, Lou, a 26-yr old Englishwoman.  I read the book for two days - finishing late last night.  It was just a FINE FINE story.  Is this a \\"romantic\\" novel?  I don't know - I don't usually read romance novels - but this definitely has an unusual romance. . .which comes thru so clearly w/ Moyes' writing.  Just go get this book and read it!!<br /><br />There are a few chapters in the voices of other characters - but they work and don't disrupt the flow of the book.  The relationship between Lou and her \\"charge\\" - the quadriplegic - is so darn compelling and Lou's emotions seem real and very close to the surface.<br /><br />So for me - this is one of those writers whom I now add to my \\"short list\\" of - waiting for their next book.
B008GX2YQQ|5.0|As with much of their music (for myself) I had to listen to this CD once or twice in it's entirety to really enjoy it. Initially when I listened to it, I felt that unlike most of their other CD's, each song sounded more or less the same. But after really getting to know the CD, I enjoy each song as much as the last. 5/5
B003TSEEDY|4.0|It was written in a style I would not attribute to typical \\"trying to be normal\\" teenaged boys. But the actions and emotions are believable. I work with kids this age. The issues presented are fairly typical. Sad to say I have spoken to many kids who have survived far worse abuse.
B00006BTCA|4.0|I will admit the first time I listened to it, I thought each song kind of sounded the same. However after listening to it once or twice I have more appreciation for each individual song. Worth a listen. 4/5
B00A0SKFLG|3.0|I saw the original again not too long ago and noted how dated it seemed. Still it was a great movie. This one didn't need to be made as it didn't improve the idea, which either way isn't true to the PKD short story in any event. The Mars angle of the first was much more compelling than a wasteland Earth that has only two inhabited areas, Britain and Australia aka The Colony.<br /><br />For some reason the chem warfare that devastated the rest of the planet spared those two locations (?), which can now only be reached via a through-the-center-of-the-earth hole (\\"keep digging Johnny, you'll hit China\\"). Flight is apparently RIGHT OUT for some unexplained reason. Also mystifying is the fact that a still chem-devastated area is only a short subway ride from unaffected downtown Britain, meaning weather has also been forestalled along with flight. But beyond those problems the worst part of the film is when the seventy-five year old leader of the Britain side kicks the crap out of our hero, twice. To keep the plot moving you see.<br /><br />Still it was nice to see Kate as a villian. Collin played befuddled throughout.<br /><br />Worth seeing for the $1.20 redbox price.
B000B8QEYC|5.0|Enya has a way of transcending you and taking you to a peaceful, soothing place. Her voice is pure magic and it touches your very soul. I would recommend this album to everyone searching for that something special.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I loved this book!! I couldn't put it down! I love that it's on the dogs point of view and the story was fantastic! Makes me look at my pup a little differently! :)
B005ZUR724|5.0|i like playing this game it reminds me of wow .. a a a a a a ababababa a a
0765325950|5.0|(I will try to avoid spoilers)<br /><br />While the final book might not be what everyone wanted/expected, I think it did a very nice job of tying up the various plots that have been going on throughout the series.  Particularly given the immense amount of details going into an epic series and only having the notes / impressions of what Mr. Jordan himself would have wanted.  Some parts were stretched a bit thinner than I would have liked - I suspect, out of necessity, or else we'd be looking at another book - but I was satisfied with the various endings.  Being a huge Sanderson fan, it was hard for me not to see the parallels between A Memory of Light and [[ASIN:0575089946 Hero of Ages]], but I think that was to be expected.  Overall, I don't think readers will be disappointed.  RIP Mr. Jordan, thank you for the epic journey.<br /><br />P.S. Shame on you folks dropping 1*'s for not getting an ebook version right away.  Giving a bad rating to a book *you haven't even read* just because you can't read it *right now* is stupid.  Real fans will buy the book regardless.  If you really want it right away, try patronizing your local library or just buy it.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Excellent product and price! It arrived fast with prime shipping. Would definitely order more products like this. My kids love these types of movies. Keep em coming!
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Awesome game for the price!! Even though exterminating humanity is kind of creepy (it's a game people!) it is fun, especially for the price!!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Very addicting! One of the best shows I have seen in a long time. Can't wait to watch the third season.
B0097PW7H8|4.0|I was skeptical at first, but this app works extremely well! Showed me which apps were draining my battery, and which ones I should kill. Highly recommend it!
B000VDDDVO|5.0|There are certain movies that need to be owned, this is one of them! Gave it to my hubby for Christmas. I like this set because it has the original black & white and also the colorized version which is not as garish as some of the early colorized movies. We watched it Christmas night in color.  Personally I prefer the original black & white so it's nice to have both options available for those who aren't into black & white.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I do not feel like I'm reading The Hunger Games or, for that matter, a book by Collins. This book read like Collins had to make it movie worthy. Almost as if nothing came in a circle, questions left unanswered.
B002APU580|5.0|I keep renting it as I just have to see it every few months.  I love this era and the scenery is especially compelling.  Every actor is an excellent performer and I love happy endings!!
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book. It is so heartwarming<br />And touches your heart and soul with every page read<br />About the great March family. WOULD RECOMMEND!
B009X01ELC|2.0|I received it and it fits the kindle goo. It works pretty well. After a few minutes using it I got dizzy and found out that it was from the odor it has. I left it open in the garage to see if the odor goes away. It's been 3 days and still smells very strong like petroleum.
0515142247|1.0|I read Book 1 and really enjoyed the unique writing style.  The use of first person, in the mind of Reacher, was engaging and kept the pace going.  Unfortunately, this book follows a more mainstream style and the dialog is exceeding rough, right? Every character ends all of their sentences with right, right?  It's not like it's a verbal flaw of just one character, right?  Because that would make sense, right?  It's all of them, right?  Plus, they talk in clipped phrases that no one would ever use, right?  Hell is he talking about, right? It's so distracting that you can't get past it, right?  Kind of annoying even to read this review, right?  Try a whole book of it, right?<br /><br />This is brutal.  I finish just about every book I start, no matter how bad, but this one is proving to be a serious challenge.  I'm about 3/4 of the way through it and just can't find the energy to want to pick it up.  My wife read the entire Reacher series and said I should keep going because they're good but I'm struggling.  I'm hopeful that his writing style matures as the series goes on.  I'm a bit skeptical, though, because Book 1 was written so much better than Book 2.  I can't speak to the plot because I can't get past how remedial it is.  My 13 year old daughter has a better grasp of literature, right?
0307592731|5.0|Strayed takes the most trite of story lines - the journey as a process of self-discovery - and turns it into something entirely new. The journey itself - wrought with danger, hardship, and uncertainty - is suspenseful, but the real joy is the subtlety and understanding with which Strayed describes each of her characters (Emilio Estevez's wonderful movie \\"The Way\\" has some similarities here). Juxtaposed with the journey itself are the little messes that Strayed has made in her life: her divorce (for which she takes complete responsibility), the early death of her mother, which left her bereft and wandering, her heroin addiction, and her inability to focus. It is the lack of self-pity, and her never blaming anyone other than herself, that pulls her through. Life is ever changing - the most brutal lesson was the way her stepfather, the real father in her life, moved on after her mother died, and essentially left her an orphan. The heart-breaking scene with the horse represented the culmination of that betrayal. These are the messes that people leave for others to clean up when responsibility is shirked.<br /><br />The tale is told a decade or so later - from a point of greater wisdom. But the wisdom Strayed gives to us is the time-honored secret (to paraphrase Churchill): Never, never, never, never give up.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I enjoy this game because it is quick and easy.  The sound does't match the visuals very often, but that isn't' real important to me.
B003O86FMW|5.0|All the events happening are just as surprising as the next. Hard to put the book down. It keeps you wanting to read more.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Outstanding series. It gives perspective on the way of live in earlier times with people that had considerable wealth and holdings.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I love this game!  If you have 10 minutes to spare...this is a fun, quick game!<br />  Never had a bug or experienced any other problems.
B009S6ZKSO|5.0|U can always count on a Kelly Clarkson cd to be great and as usual every song on this cd is up to expectations!
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|This is one of my favorite kids movies of all time. A must see, must own type of movie :)
B004RFYEEC|5.0|My 17-year-old son is a guitar-playing rocker and Beach Boys lover.  The Smile Box Set was the hit of his Christmas.
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|It's okay for a game for kids that likes  doing the same thing over and over.  Might be a little to childish for some adults.
B0041KKYGU|3.0|it's ok- the preview we saw before hand made it look funnier than what the show actually was.<br />thanks steve
141659521X|5.0|My son in law requested this as a gift.  He has read every Vince Flynn book and eagerly awaits the next.  He was delighted.
B000HIVIOW|5.0|The music is so beautiful and I love the &#34;no dialogue&#34;' It is just a joy for kids and adults of all ages!
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I love John Grisham and I liked the book but was a little disappointed in the ending.  Will always read John Grisham novels.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|Not as shocking as I had imagined it to be. I liked Christian, Anna got on my nerves but all in all an interesting read.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|I haven't read a Grisham book in ages due to predictable story lines so didn't have high hopes, but was pleasantly surprised by the book.  Kept looking forward to when I could pick it up again. Wasn't disappointed by purchase.
0765325950|5.0|I am going to immediately cop to not having received my 30-pound hardcover edition of A Memory of Light just yet. I pre-ordered it nineteen years ago from Amazon before the company even existed and if I have to wait another 24 rainy hours before the book itself arrives, so be it. I know, I know. I could run to a Barnes & Noble and just read the book in their awesomely stylized cafes. Or, alternately, given the two and a half decade publishing history of The Wheel of Time, I could just wait another few months for a more convenient and cheaper e-book to come out. But hell, I just want to be the only person who--even as an avid e-book reader--is happy to have ordered the regular old physical copy and I'm content to wait another day or two for it to come.<br /><br />To all of you shills and fools who are complaining about Tor's greed or the publishing policy that leads to delayed e-book releases, just can it. The sci-fi/fantasy publishing industry is not some vast, multi-billion dollar conglomerate and most authors earn a few thousand dollars for a book that took them months, if not years, to put together. Often enough, publishers are happy to have just broken even on a publication. So if one book can make the company a profit, then sweet Jesus, don't begrudge them. I myself am looking forward to the day when the next huge Sci-Fi/Fantasy bestseller comes along: his or her work will have been supported from the money made from books like Jordan's.<br /><br />The few parts of the book I've read--the prologue, Chapters 1 and 2, parts of Chapters 3 and 11--seem fun and awesome. I can't wait to fill in the gaps and get to the end.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Book two of the Hunger Games leaves the reader wanting more. There's plenty of action and suspense to keep you intrigued. ENJOY!
B0051UP5NQ|4.0|Decent app.  A lot better than polaris (the built in app that comes with most android systems.)  Definitely has more functionality.
B005BZQVJ8|1.0|I enjoy comedy. This movie had lots of funny bits in it and the crass humor that i expected for this genre of movie and all was well until the introduction of a \\"Christian\\" female character in the movie. The movie suddenly became less about a foul mouthed alien and more about God bashing and pushing an atheist agenda. It also portrayed Christians as imbecilic and fools. As a Christian I love to laugh and i really enjoy comedies. This movie had some of my favorite characters in it but i simply couldn't get past all the bashing of the belief in God. 95% of Americans believe that there is some form of God, and i believe that this movie could have been plenty funny without flagrantly calling us all fools. It was very offensive to me and i simply stopped watching.
B00846WWVM|4.0|Its very cute and makes my son think about how to accomplish each level.<br /><br />Not violent and requires thinking. Easy to use.
B0076DELIG|3.0|His scenes with women make me squirm with awkwardness. I read this as soon as I bought it and immediately forgot what it was about.
0670827592|5.0|I have loved this story since junior high and I wanted to share it with my students at school.  They loved the story too.
B002RB7VMA|5.0|The first time I heard Michael Buble I knew this was a voice that could tease me, caress me, challenge me, and entertain me. While this does not have any of his live tracks, the songs are solid, strong, somewhat reminiscent of the 60s, and altogether pleasant. Put it on, pour a good dry martini, and listen to &#34;I Just Haven't Met You Yet.&#34;
B005K0HDGE|4.0|I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because a few places dragged, but not that many.  If you have a Stephen King addiction, make sure you read it.
B009CPEOC4|3.0|It was an ok movie a little typical and boring in some areas, but my niece seemed to like it enough to ask me to order it for her. I don't recommend this movie to any of my friends but I would if you like Katy and her music.
B0050SYS5A|1.0|Either I am placing the zoom on incorrectly ( I tried 10 times) or something is just not right.<br /><br />NOT WORKING as advertised
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is so much fun to play. I love to jump over objects and slide under objects. I'm so glad I didn't pass up this game.
B005VTGB0S|5.0|This is great for a simple cover.it doesn't turn off iPad automatically but that's ok also I just leave the top strap loose to control volume
B0050R0XPA|5.0|Our family decided to take all of our Legos and make a Christmas village out of them, to display around the tree.  We purchased this product to help round out our Christmas village look.  It did not disappoint.  It really ended up making our village look legit!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|This book left me wanting more, and wanting Christian Grey! He really evolves by the end of this book making you need to get the second book asap! I recommended this book to all my girlfriends and they read it just as fast as I did and ran out to get the second book. Luckily with my kindle, I didn't have to wait more than a minute to start book 2!
B008MEM24S|2.0|Game itself is fun but when you go to buy the doofensmirtz levels it errors. It tries to load Amazon marketplace but then says error and reloads.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I loved the first book, but this one really digs more into Christian and his love for Ana, plus there was more adventure in this book for the couple instead of just sex, which added a great element to the book.
B006TTC5JK|5.0|What a film, Stewart, on time comedy lines, it is great. Another Xmas present will bring lots of joy here.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Left me wanting a 4th book...the 2nd book is my favorite though, but I would read all 3 all over again!
B001JIFYSA|5.0|The movie reminds us that love is indeed all around us<br />when you find it in yourself first. It's timeless.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Just like the first in the series, I could not put this book down!! What great writing....can't wait to start book 3.
B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|Wonderful book that really sparks the imagination.  I love reading Jack London books and was happy to download it to my kindle.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|While the reader's empathy for the innocent but convicted narrator of The Racketeer will never waver, the plot twists and questionable character motives of the supporting cast of characters will keep the pages turning.  Those who appreciate the nuts and bolts of a good scam will enjoy finding out about RICO laws and how to use loopholes to advantage.  Although the author concedes to doing little research in the end notes, the intricacy of the plot, and the hallmark &#34;I didn't see it coming&#34; Grisham effect are alive and well in this novel.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I like the game for a free app it keeps me entertained. The advertising is not to bothersome either. It works great on kindle fire.
0399247459|5.0|This was one of my favorites as a child. It's a classic for good reason so I am sharing it with my children. It's a simple but neat story and provides opportunities for learning a variety of things such as days of the week and the caterpillar's transformation to a butterfly. I've been reading this to my son since he was 1 year old and even at that age he enjoyed flipping through the pages and peeping through the little holes while looking at all the colorful pictures as I read it to him.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Who thought so many events could pull together in interesting twists and still keep their audience interested and eager to find out what happens next without coming off as a soap?!
0765325950|5.0|Have not had a chance to read the book yet, I hope it will be a fitting conclusion to a truly epic series. I understand the frustration of those who want an ebook; but a review of the product is the wrong place to express that displeasure. Send an e-mail to Tor or Amazon. (If you thought protesting here would effect sales, I would still disagree, but I would see the point...but rating this book down will have zero impact on sales, and will in fact bury any legitimate criticism of the book)
B009IF8CH6|5.0|There are few shows that are funny and smart, this is one of them. I would recommend this show to anyone.
B005LAII1C|5.0|I predict this will become a classic. I missed a bunch of one-liners because I was laughing too loud from the one before!
B009FZHYKU|3.0|I like this show, but there is a gaping hole in the representation of human behavior.  I'm writing this review specifically to soapbox about it because I think it's important.<br /><br />One kind of character that is missing is the smart, strong, or lucky guy or group who has a bit of economic intelligence.  That kind of character is a blessing to find because they're capable of more than what they need to do to survive, and this &#34;extra&#34; provides them with something they can trade.  In such dire circumstances, nearly everyone who survives would be like that.  Walking Dead unfortunately overlooks this and therefore sells short the nature of human intelligence and our fantastic and versatile abilities to cooperate.<br /><br />So watch it with this in mind and you will see how dreary and miserable life would be if we, as individuals, don't exploit our abilities and circumstances to create this &#34;extra&#34; that makes us valuable to one another.
B00516G5W0|5.0|Great Figure don't think twice and buy it today! It goes well with the other Straw Hat Pirates as well.
B00AKL1XPU|1.0|I usually like Gameloft games. This one was dull though.  Deleted after 10 minutes. There are much better empire building games out there. I particularly don't like it when Gameloft makes it MANDATORY that you use the special currency (in this case peanuts) during the tutorial. There is no way to earn peanuts without real money...at least I didn't find a way plus it's that way in Oregon Trails.  That game is actually good if you don't mind the bugs and the loud bleeping noise it gives off since the game remains open on your kindle fire at all times even when using another app. Why am I even recommending that game?  Oh yeah, cause at least its more fun.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Flow Free started out slow - nothing to it but gradually grew more challenging and now I'm finding it hard to put it down.
0425263916|5.0|I am a Fifty Shades of Grey fan and I read all three books. I was looking for a comparable series of books and I came across the Crossfire Novels by Sylvia Day. I really feel like the Crossfire Novels are the perfect books for someone who is looking for something similar to the Fifty Shades trilogy. I almost think I like this series better, if thats even possible. Anyone looking for a follow up for Fifty Shades should read the Crossfire Novels. You will not be dissapointed!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Didn't hear about this &#34;Trilogy&#34; unitl watching a talk show, then I began looking for the books and couldn't find them anywhere, so I purchased a Kindle and when purchasing the book, discovered it was a Trilogy - really?  When I first began book 1 I wasn't that crazy about it but as I read more, I couldn't put it down - boy was I glad I was reading this on my Kindle Fire - yeah!!<br /><br />Into book 3 found out others in the office were reading - you'll find that out also.<br /><br />Loved the &#34;Trilogy&#34;  Because I have it on my Kindle, don't have to worry about my girlfriend loosing my copy - will re-read this Summer.<br /><br />Laters.....<br /><br />You'll learn and love the phrase soon enough.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|My Fiance and I had never heard of this movie but we figured we would give it a shot. We ended up loving this movie. We laughed the whole time we watched it! I have never been a fan of action movies but this one was the exception. I could watch this again and not get tired of it.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|At this point, you can't, won't stop reading.  So don't, you won't be disappointed.  There will be no other trilogy like this again.
B005LAII12|5.0|We love this movie! It is very funny and when my boyfriend and I saw it in the theater we never stopped laughing. When we left the Theater our faces actually hurt from laughing so much. I was skeptical about seeing this movie because I have never really been a fan of movie's with animation, but this was exceptionally good. It is definitely not a movie for kids. It also has some content which could be offensive to some groups of people, but it is put together in a mostly tactful way.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|This was a great book, ending was, well a little to, you know for those that have finished, for those that haven't I won't ruin it for you - no matter what, if you come - no pun intended, this far, you are probably putting out your virtural cigarette.
B000KFB4PK|4.0|I bought the LEGO Kids' Make-N-Create Watch for my 9 year old son for Christmas and he wears it every day. He likes putting things together and this watch allowed him to do just that. He has other watches that have normal wrist bands and are digital but he doesn't leave home without this watch.
B0085P2Z6E|4.0|Great search game. Easy to use and ok graphic. The only bad part is night mode and every time u move the screen it thinks made a guess
B007SGM084|3.0|I received the Kindle Fire HD for Christmas. I'd heard so much about the Fifty Shades book and decided to purchase all three to test the capabilities of my new kindle. Because of my hectic schedule it has taken me all of two weeks to complete all three books. I found them to be an interesting read. I must say I was a bit surprised at first with regards to the subject matter if BDS&M being incorporated into the story line. The author has certainly helped to increase my literary vocabulary. There were a few times when the story seemed to get a little monotonous. However for the most part this trilogy was a welcome distraction in my daily routine. I would recommend it to a friend.
B002VWNID6|1.0|Okay first lets start with the deceiving title.  You do a search on Amazon for Robin Hood and come up with this picture of the movie saying released February 2010.  WRONG.  When you click on it, you get redirected to the 1997 DVD release version.  Now I am a fan of the movie so this not a review of the movie rather the overall product.  Nowhere does it say that this movie is a split DVD ie during the movie you will play it on one side for half of the movie and then you need to flip it over to get the rest of the movie.  So overall DO NOT BUY THIS DVD.  Buy the special 2 disc Edition or if you want to get blu ray do that.  However, my personal opinion about blu-ray movies that were not originally shot in blu-ray quality cameras will never match the quality of blu-ray material.  Save your money and stay cheap on older movies with standard dvds.  So hopefully you read this and save yourself the frustration of finding out that this particular DVD is not what you will want in your collection.  Took me a while to figure out I had to flip the dvd over as there is nothing in the product that tells you to do so nor does it tell you in the product description.  Buyer beware. [[ASIN:B002VWNID6 Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves]]
0525423656|5.0|The second book of Match, Crossed is a lot more better then the first one. Ally's writing continues to amaze me. I have never read something that had such amazing writing. Crossed does not disappoint and this book it told from both Cassia's and Ky's point of view and Ally managed to make both point of views very good especially Ky's, and we learn a lot more about him. Crossed made me like Ky a lot more.<br /><br />Plot<br /><br />Ky was taken to the Outer Provinces, were Anomalies and Aberration are sent as village decoys were they are sure to be killed by the Enemy. Cassia goes to the Outer Province to reunite with Ky only to find out that he had escaped to the Carvings along with to other people, Vick and Eli. (Vick was a guy Ky grow close to and Eli, who reminded Ky of Bram) Cassia goes on her journey along with Indie, someone who Cassia has allied with.
B005LHOKFS|5.0|Have used this app for years. I have found the information to be very helpful. I have traveled across the country and used the reviews for lodging and attractions. The reviews for lodging have been right on. I have found them accurate and through. I have also found some excellent B&Bs based upon reviewers. It is also a great place to post your own reviews to share.
B004XZR63M|5.0|This book have changed my view on the world. So simple yet it requires to have an open mind to understand it. This has been my first out of many books to come to learn about being financially literate.<br />Thank you<br />Aleksey Markelov
B000Q99EAC|5.0|This was very entertaining movie about a Rocky come back after retirement. Although it is a fight movie, it has a great story line.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book was great! It was hard to put down because it was so suspenseful. I really enjoyed reading this and it is probably one of my favorites by Nicolas Sparks. It wasn't a typical Nicolas Sparks book because he had more of an edge to it, but the edge made it amazing.
B003Q6BQPS|5.0|Bought as a Christmas gift. Again, this set did not disappoint. The detailing is great, easy to build, the highlight was definitely the light brick. Lots of neat extras to add to their Lego collection, pieces that they didn't have before.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I liked this story. It had good character development and a compelling plot. I recommend this book to someone looking for new science-fiction
B007L96SI6|5.0|Awesome CD. If you liked her on American Idol I definitely suggest you buy this CD. Shipment was very quick.
B00A80SHFM|2.0|As a huge fan of the stage musical \\"Les Miserables,\\" I was so looking forward to the film version. But I also had fears. Hollywood has a checkered past when it comes to turning Broadway plays and musicals into films. Two of my all time favorite Broadway musicals - \\"A Chorus Line\\" and \\"Rent\\" - were not adapted well at all and I'm afraid these film versions have sullied their reputations as great shows. I add the film of \\"Les Miserables\\" to that list for one really big reason: they cast actors who are poor singers in a movie that is entirely sung! It was painful to listen to in the movie theater and painful to hear the samples here. I know Russell Crowe is getting the brunt of the criticism, but he isn't alone. Hugh Jackman may have acted the role of Jean Valjean well, but his singing was awful. A highpoint of the stage show is \\"Bring Him Home,\\" which every time I saw the show (4), brought down the house. Jackman's version was just merely fair and not memorable at all. ANY OTHER version of this song is preferable to this one. (Check out Alfie Boe, for example.) Helena Bonham Carter (who I usually love) and Sasha Baron Cohen were also poor performers. Not sure how I feel about Amanda Seyfried. Technically, she sounded fine - on key. But she has an odd, trilling voice and I kept wondering that with all the wonderful, beautiful soprano voices out there, how did she get the role? On the good side, Anne Hathaway, Elizabeth Barks and Eddie Redmayne were fine. They were the highlights. But overall, the poor singing really did an injustice to this beautiful song score. So, take my advice, if you are interested in this music, get ANY OTHER recording but, please, not this one. Two stars because the source material is so great, but it's a total fail on execution.
B009VB97EY|5.0|Saw this is the theatre in Tampa withy girlfriends! Great movie - had to have a copy!<br />Funny movie, the guys were all great!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I enjoy this more than I thought I ever would.  The easy games are not challenging but it gets better.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Exactly what I needed. Great read. No problems at all w/ this product! Highly recommend to others!<br /><br />Also ordered them in paperback!
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|Maybe I'm just geeky, but love the whole idea of using your own characters in a&nbsp;game. Just started playing and already has me guessing!
0345529057|2.0|If I wrote this review after just reading the first book of this series I would have given it five stars because you just can't wait to see your favorite characters shine after such setbacks.  Well, after three books, no one shines.  It just goes on and on while the characters you liked in book one either die or become less and less interesting.  There are no climaxes to reward the reader so the fascination one may have developed in this first book \\"A Game Of Thrones\\" turnes to chargrin when it's realized the author is trying to sell more books by extending a tedious story.  Way too much time and detail is spent on insignificant events.  You will love this first book, but you will be skimming pages by book two and skimming chapters by book three.  I don't know how this story that started out so promising is going to ever end, but it has become so tedious, and so many of the characters have let me down, I don't really care.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I have been looking for a book that I actually want to keep reading because I need to finish it. This is the first book in awhile that made me patiently wait for my daughter to wake up in the middle of the night so I had an excuse to read more of the novel. Great read!
B000YHG72E|5.0|This is such a great and wonderful heartwarming movie! The more I watch it the more I love it. Cheers!
B003PIUC02|3.0|This is a great show, that I had already watched and purchased to have it at home and watch with my wife. Unfortunately, the first CD episode 2 was damaged and we could not play the first half of episode 2
B0084B5TK8|5.0|My first download for my kindle. No problems. One of my favorite books. I look forward to reading his other works.
B004HW7JMY|5.0|This is a great TV show, full of conspiracy, sex, violence. Very well written and full of great actors & actresses. Make sure to get the kids & weak somachs out the room
B000076CY6|5.0|This was a christmas gift for my son.  He absolutely loves it and is looking forward to collecting the entire series.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This is a fun and challenging game.  I enjoy it!<br />I am a very visual and color loving person so this game is attractive to me.
B006OB3K56|5.0|that's all that needs to be said. you don't watch it you experience it. all the actors give amazing performances. a great film.
B009VB7P6G|5.0|This movie is hilarious. I mean we are tinkerbell fans in general but the consensus at our house is its the best one yet!
B00APUYWYA|5.0|My husband got way more laughs than I did; it was nice to see him laughing so hard. This movie is a lot of fun to watch, I watched it two days in a row, which I have never done. But it puts you in a good mood, a playful mood after watching it. I highly recommend watching this movie. However, I must admit, the last vomit seen was a bit extreme, other than that... I loved it.
B00785P2QC|4.0|I love it. if you like being in charge I think u will like this game. Happy New Year! !
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book is really good. The ending is amazing. Starts out slow, but almost all good books start out slow.
B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|With so many reviews there is not much I can add except that I should have read Jack London's classic story years ago. I hate the hardships and cruelty suffered by the dogs. I found those parts difficult to read, but Buck was stronger than the hardships. No wonder people name their dogs after him; what a legend. And no wonder boys want to be like John Thornton and Buck.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Very interesting. I can't wait to see what's in store in the next book. It was very full of suspense.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This story was an inspiration. If only more kindness existed in this world for those who don't exactly fit the definition of \\"normal\\".
B00746O3X8|5.0|More substantial than anticipated. Very flexible and well-conceived design. I have used it several times and it performs exactly as anticipated. Highly recommended.
B009OYTAL8|5.0|If you like super hero movies you will like this show. It is fast paced, has some good drama as well and has really good action sequences
B00735HGQ6|5.0|This is such a wonderful book, I want to hug Harold, not that he'd let me....<br />I thought I knew where it was going and how it would end but I was entirely wrong and I loved that about this book.  It caught me off guard.  Please Read and share it with everyone you know.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Awesome series!!!  I watched the whole season in two days: and can't wait to watch season 3 unfold!  Totally enjoyed it!
B0085KGHI6|5.0|great show. this is live blues at its best. if you love the blues,you have to see this. classic show!!!!
B003VDY7XE|4.0|I have enjoyed watching season 1 of Haven.  It reminds me of the X-Files series by Chris Carter. So, if you liked the X-Files,<br />you will probably like Haven.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|Came quickly, no problems. I have seen later seasons of this series, which I love, looking forward to seeing how it started.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love this app!! Fast and has everything I am looking for. There are so many great ideas!!! Plus the app works great
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|we have a similar game at the desktop,  and we really enjoyed it.  It was great to get it ft or my tablet.  I will recommend it.
B000HIVIOW|5.0|This is a great movie for all little ones. the music and pictures are soothing and as the child grows they understand more of the story.  I buy it for all new parents !
B009MCRHH6|5.0|I had paid for this game on the Google Play store probably a year before it was available as the free app of the day (the only reason I grabbed it again was because I couldn't believe that it was available for free).  At any rate, the game was well worth paying for and I would do it again.
B0063IH60K|3.0|Way too many ads between games.  VERY  ANNOYING.<br />GAME IS OK BUT TOO MANY ADS.. PLEASE FIND A WAY TO CHANGE THIs.<br /><br />VJRAPO@YAHOO
B002VRZEYM|4.0|A great look into the corruption of the food industry. I wish it was more in depth, but a good documentary none the less.
B007EECSFA|5.0|I have read all of Kate Morton's books and they are fantastic. This book definitely keeps you hooked and I personally wanted to keep reading to find out the 'secret.' The ending shocked me! but overall, very, very awesome book.
B00846REIS|5.0|I can almost say I enjoyed this book more than fifty shades of grey! Extremely intense, enjoyable, and emotional all in one!
B007XNAQL0|5.0|This concert of Peter Gabriel is AMAZING all, I love it 100% him and the musicians are excellent and this concert is # Nº 1 CONCERT

B007NQVRNS|5.0|I love this movie, when I sow it for th first time a play it again and again and now that I have it in blu ray I enjoy It 100% more
1423151054|3.0|The flip book idea is great.  And,  to be fair,  the art selected for the Kimball book hasn't been previously published --- unfortunately the same can't be said for the drawings used in the rest of the books.  Why is it that Pierre Lambert and Christian Renaut find ways of filling their books with absolutely breathtaking,  never before seen Disney art while homegrown authors keep using the same old drawings over and over again?  If we want Thomas' scene we can go to any of four other previously published animation books.  Same goes for Kahl,  Lounsbery, Davis,  Reitherman or<br />Clark (anybody seen the catalog for the Chiba exhibit? Or Canemaker's Nine Old Men?).  How hard would it be to locate something new and fresh?<br />And,  by the way,  the reproduction quality of the Johnston drawings is inexcusable.  Doesn't anyone at D23 care?
B007I1TFK0|5.0|I love Madonna acting lake Evita, and Antonio Banderas also is a great actor. This musical is great all and I enjoy it alway when a see it and more know that it is in blu ray
B007SGM084|5.0|These books were definitely entertaining. I enjoyed how Christian was able to grow up throughout the books. Ana was seriously an amazing character....sounds like a woman in total love and awe of her man. Enjoyed all 3 books!
B006WXHJVC|5.0|They say that the first movie is the best when they do more movies about the same, but this not happens with this movies the first, the second, the third and the fourth are in this case VERY BUT VERY FUNNY all of them. the kids are great actor and they are also very funny.
B007G92QGO|5.0|Mr Landy for what it is worth you have a new fan.  Thank you for keeping me up the first night I started reading this book, and then saying goodbye to my husband when he went off to work the next morning and locking the front door, taking the phone off the hook and reading right until the end and being thoroughly shocked by the ending!!  Marvelous book - thank you.

B000FCKGPC|4.0|This series, while very entertaining is really a never ending story, in other words it's really a soap opera.  There doesn't seem to be any conclusion to any of the events that are unfolding.  The cast of characters are so large that it takes the equivalent of an entire chapter in the book just to tell who they are. The whole series of novels, to this point, are stories of betrayal, suspicion, fornication, jealousy, greed, pride and all the seven deadly sins. Every time a hero starts to emerge, the author finds ways to kill them off.  We are left with a dead vengeful woman who hanged her most loyal follower, a young queen locked up in a prison with guards that know she is innocent of the crimes she is charged with by the greedy and power hungry queen regent, the queen regent imprisoned with some uncertain future, along with a crippled boy who is persusing a dream in the north that is not what he wanted. This is not to mention the bastard son of Ed Stark who is now Lord Commander of the Night Watch, with few men in black to carry out the tasks that seem to be looming ahead. Perhaps Lord Snow will end up being our hero. Who knows? The story is so interwoven with plots and subplots with so many characters, that the fifth novel has no way to bring a conclusion to the story. Look forward to a six and seventh novel in this series.  This epic is approaching the \\"Wheel of Time\\" series by Robert Jordan for length. And you know what happened to him.

0765325950|5.0|Like all of you, I've eagerly awaited this book.  I plan to savor each word as I would a good wine or dark chocolate candy.<br />The book jacket is beautiful.  I received my book from Amazon in the mail yesterday and took it with me to a doctor appointment.  The other waiting patients, the front office staff, the PA and my doctor all mentioned what a beautiful book and asked about it.  I was pleased to introduce the \\"Wheel of Time\\" with 12 new people yesterday.<br />I don't want to know how it ends, and I won't share it when I know.  Each of us should have the pleasure and privilege to journey with Rand at our own pace and in our own way, just like climbing a new route on rock.  If you're a climber then you'll understand this:  \\"No Beta Please.\\"
B009O2XY12|2.0|Loved the game fun & addicting BUT I uninstalled it because after so many shoots they charge you for more balls!!! It said FREE game! What the heck. Very dissapointed.
B00782O7NE|5.0|Yes the film is ni 4:3 aspect ratio, black and white, and contains no spoken dialogue. But there is planty of music (including a nod to Vertigo) and so much charm. It seems strange that some viewers are not able to appreciate this unconventionally presented but quite comprehensible story of devotion, loyalty, and perserverance. The perfprmances are all excellent and the black and the cinematography outstanding. There is genuine joy in this film, especially with the two leading characters. The dog and the excellent character actors also add a moral dimension that is not too serious but enlarges the emotions. Highly recommended.

B004LWZWGK|5.0|The Dark Knight Rises marks the conclusion to Christopher Nolan's ambitious and compelling Dark Knight Trilogy and it delivers the goods as a complex and troubling examinaton of conflicted heroes, corrupt legal and political systems and societal breakdown.  That it is able to accomplish this in the guise of an entertaining summer action flick is all the more remarkable.  Some have felt let down by this final installment and comparisons to its predecessor have been inevitable, but Rises is its own film.  It is as different from The Dark Knight as Knight was from Batman Begins.  Yet it ultimately ties in beautifully to the overall themes of the trilogy as a whole and is as much a part of the other films as it is a separate and uinque entity.<br /><br />Eight years after the events of The Dark Knight, Gotham is enjoying an unprecedented era of low crime rates and prosperity.  The death of Harvey Dent galvanized politicians, lawmakers and citizens and paved the way for passage of The Dent Act which gave lawmakers added heft in the war on crime.  Yet Gotham's new found security is based on a lie that has nearly consumed the souls of the men who carry it.  Commissioner Gordon struggles with whether or not to finally reveal the truth to the people about who Dent really was.  Meanwhile, Bruce Wayne has secluded himself in Wayne Manor to nurse his physical and psychological wounds.<br /><br />Wayne is drawn out of the shadows after an encounter with Selena Kyle, a jewel thief who is trying to swipe a pearl necklace from his safe.  Selena draws Wayne out into the open again and ultimately into the clutches of Bane, a beefy brawler who is building an army below the city streets.  Bane is determined to bring Gotham to its collective knees and Wayne is an integral part of his end game.  Bane has been compared to Heath Ledger's Joker from The Dark Knight, but that's a bit unfair.  Bane is no Joker, to be certain, but he's not supposed to be.  The Joker was an unhinged mad man who wanted to wreak as much havoc as possible while Bane has a more focused plan and is a bigger picture type of villian.<br /><br />I won't go into too much detail about the events that unfold as Bane works to destroy Batman and his beloved city since that information is so vital to the overall viewing experience.  Just know that TDKR is full of breathtaking action, amazing set pieces, social and political commentary and most importantly, hope.  The hope that heores can come from anywhere and be anyone and the hope that no civilization is beyond saving, and no individual is beyond redemption.  And of course the hope that big budget Hollywood blockbusters can be more than just noisy distractions from our daily lives.wanted to wreak as much havoc as possible while Bane has a more focused plan and is a bigger picture type of villian.<br /><br />I won't go into too much detail about the events that unfold as Bane works to destroy Batman and his beloved city since that information is so vital to the overall viewing experience.

B00APUYWYA|4.0|Fun, snappy, and full of college shenanigans, this is an entertaining, enjoyable movie. Even though I'm many decades removed from this era, I found it got me humming right along with the excellent a capella singing I always enjoy. Performances by the main actors were on the mark. For a light-hearted, full-of-laughs glimpse into competition for love and the perfect performance, watch Perfect Pitch!

B006T3RM08|1.0|This thing is not worth the money... why you ask? well i could tell you a million things wrong with it. Starting with how its too tight of a fit that it constantly shuts off my trackpad. It also holds the Trackpad so tight that you cant click it not even touch select because its stuck holding it so tightly. the keyboard side is great though!

Also you can find lots of good craft ideas and spend a whole evening just browsing.  One thing I was very upset about was that by wondering around and poking here and there, I  came upon porn and that I did not like at all.  My 17 yr old granddaughter had asked if that was a sight that was safe for her to wonder around nd I said yes, but had to tell her that I found the porn.  Id there a way that the porn can be kept out?

So my brother ended up with two.  Amazon - Need to work on removing items from wish lists when they are added to someone's cart!
B00AEFVRB2|3.0|good movie overall, but a little weird at times.  Noirish and violent definitely, but well-acted.  Biggest criticism was that it resembled a play too much at times.  Guess that was inevitable as it was based on a play.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|Casino Royale is the Twenty-first James Bond film since Eon released Dr. No all the way back in 1962. In over forty years, the character has been played by just over five actors, including Sean Connery, George Lazenby, Roger Moore, Timothy Dalton, and most recently Pierce Brosnan. Each actor brought their abilities into the role and embodied Bond in a different fashion (for better or worse), but for Casino Royale, Brosnan has been replaced instead by Daniel Craig, who has appeared in action films such as Tomb Raider and dramas such as Road to Peredition. He is a younger Bond with a fiercer look, but a more vulnerable interior... and thankfully, that is precisely what is needed for the film.<br /><br />Rather than continuing on from previous films in the franchise, Casino Royale opts to reboot the series and bring Bond back to the beginning of his career... to the very moment he becomes Agent 007. With two assassinations in quick succession, Bond comes charging into the world, exercising his newfound license to kill with a raw, murderous candor... but hidden beneath the apathy is a small trace of humanity that has yet to die out. By the end of the film, that will change--he will be changed--and whatever remnants of his soul are left will perish.<br /><br />But before James Bond can truly become 007, he must first travel to Montenegro, Italy to take part in a high-stakes poker game hosted by the criminal financier Le Chiffre. His mission? To ensure Le Chiffre loses his money--to make him so desperate that he will sell out his clients to MI6 and shed light on a clandestine organization that poses a significant threat to Queen and empire.<br /><br />It is a dangerous game, since Le Chiffre is fully aware of who Bond is and why he is there (making Bond's usual stupidity of revealing his name to villains part of the plot), and the man tolerates him out of desperate straits and impending need to accept MI6's protection. The cards are dealt, the players stare each other down, and the game begins--but Bond soon realizes that Le Chiffre knows too much of his plays... someone is feeding him information, but the traitor lies just out of reach....<br /><br />M is once more played by Judi Dench (who took the role in Goldeneye), but new characters also appear, most notably Eva Green as Vesper Lynd and Giancarlo Giannini as Rene Mathis. Mathis is French Secret Service, but Vesper is merely a desk agent representing Her Majesty's Treasury... and despite her snark and spunk, is wholly unfamiliar with the brand of deadly field wet-work that Bond represents. In spite of the armor that he has built over himself, Bond is intrigued by her... he begins to lose himself in her (take the entendre as you will). This is the first time we have seen a woman in his life that means more to him than a fling or a cover. Bond is maturing--the advent of actual substance into \\"Bond Girls\\" has been long in the coming.<br /><br />Also matured is the plot in general--for the first time, characters and motivations actually make sense... you may have to dig for the connections, and some plot holes still linger, but at least these discrepancies are not as ostentatious as previous films. In recent years, the Jason Bourne movies have created different expectations in the spy genre--the romantic fallacy of the spy has worn away, and the relevancy of James Bond along with it. Thankfully, Casino Royale has learned from this development rather than simply ignore the shift in audience expectations.<br /><br />Bond is still a womanizer, but this time it is less a character flaw that impedes his mission, and more of a sharpened skill that he uses to get what he needs--Bond's sex appeal has been weaponized. Why torture and interrogate a man for information when you can seduce his wife and get the same info over pleasure?<br /><br />James Bond is no longer a hero--he never was, but this is the first time that the series has openly acknowledged and addressed what he really is: theQueen's hired gun. He is an assassin--a bully of Western imperialism sent out to police the world... and those he cannot coerce, he merely kills. There is no romance in that... and so, Casino Royale becomes self-aware, telling the story of a man losing his soul to a career that is (dare we say) almost inherently evil. Just because 007 has a license from the crown to kill people and get away with it doesn't erase its damning effects on his own humanity.<br /><br />Casino Royale breaks Bond down and reveals him--it doesn't celebrate in stylized murder and bloodshed like the comically superficial films of yore. Casino Royale isn't dumb, and it doesn't insult your intelligence by glorifying a film about a career-killer. For good or bad, the overplayed antics of Roger Moore are long over--this isn't a brainless action film anymore. The 21st Bond movie injects thematic depth into a formula series that has suffered too long under shallow pageantry.<br /><br />In short, Casino Royale is more than just a Bond film--it is a genuinely good movie. Pop culture has found substance without losing any of its \\"pop\\". Rather than James Bond portrayed as a distant, alienating figure--almost Homeric in his senseless elevation--Casino Royale brings him up close under the microscope and reveals who he really is. It is a character study with bouts of action and explosions lining the periphery. This is still a genre film, and it will never really be a piece of \\"high art\\" (no one wants that anyway)... but this film does give James Bond the depth and roundness that he has always deserved.Queen's hired gun.

B002BI6SMI|3.0|Somewhat predictable daughter kidnapped and ex-cia dad tracks her down and kicks alot of butt on the way to saving her.  Neeson's chase ends up climbing higher and higher up the important and high-profile person list of douches until he finds his daughter.<br />Very entertaining even in its unbelievableness.

B009HEJXFS|3.0|A movie for MIB fans, it tries to answer some questions about MIB history, a pretty good movie, good family movie with a pretty good story.
B008I3QZKU|4.0|I have to admit, the Killers for me were always an acquired taste. With one exception - I loved Day and Age from day one (which is not what majority of people would say) and I still cannot make myself to like Sawdust. So my very first reaction after listening Battle Born was \\"hate it!\\". It is quite different from Sam's Town and Day and Age. However after listening it for, like, 100 times, I am leaning toward liking it than hating it. Somehow it is good for listening while driving; that's probably why there is a car on album's cover (I haven't tried listening it while riding a horse though, so no opinion on that matter).
B009KHDT0C|4.0|An entertaining movie with an interesting take on the original Dark Shadows.  Fun and light hearted at times, it is a little funny, philisophical, horror, all rolled into one.

1409118290|5.0|I just finished reading \\"The Reversal\\" by Michael Connelly.  This is the third book in the best-selling \\"Lincoln Lawyer\\" series.  This is the second Connelly book I have read; the first being \\"The Brass Verdict\\" which featured the first introduction between Mickey Haller and Harry Bosch.  The Brass Verdict gripped me and held me in the entire lengthy of my reading.  From start to finish, I found myself becoming invested in Haller, Bosch, Haller's ex-wife Maggie \\"McFierce\\" McPherson.  When I finished it, I genuinely felt a sense of loss from having been so gripped by this novel.  When I bought \\"The Reversal\\" I had high hopes it would do the same, as it was the next installment in the Lincoln Lawyer series.<br /><br />The Reversal not only gripped me and drew me in like it's predecessor \\"The Brass Verdict\\" but also it kept me on the edge of my seat.  I loved the futher development in the character Michael Haller.  I also loved seeing new layers into the relationship between Haller and his aforementioned ex-wife, Maggie McPherson.  It was also really great to see the continuation of a possibly blooming familial relationship between Haller and longtime Connelly character Harry Bosch.<br /><br />Plenty of other reviewers are giving summations of the plot of this novel, so I will forego that.  However, this book is once again proof the fact that Michael Connelly is a master craftsmen in the art of weaving a dynamic, thrilling, and powerful story.  Whereas, I haven't read any of the Bosch novels (I'm starting two of them tomorrow), I have been thorougly blown away by both of the Lincoln Lawyer novels that I have read thus far.  Connelly's writing is pure genuis.  I may not be versed in actual legal procedure, courtroom protocol, investigative processes, etc., as I am merely a fascinated civilian.  However, The Reversal is a novel that make it difficult for you to put it down.  I will say that I do agree with some of the other reviewers remarks about the ending.  Some people would say the mark of a great author is one who leaves his/her readers wanting more.  The Reversal definitely left me wanting more.  I'm going to be purchasing the next installment in the Lincoln Lawyer series called \\"The Fifth Witness\\".<br /><br />To wrap this up, if you love an exciting legal thriller, then you will LOVE \\"The Reversal\\" by Michael Connelly.  It is definitely true that Michael Connelly is one of the GREATEST authors working in the United States.  The Lincoln Lawyer novels could go up against anything by that guy who wrote those couple of legal thrillers that were turned into movies (only one of which was any good.) and come out on top.  I think Michael Connelly will go down as one of the greatest American writers in history, in my humble opinion of course.

0345803493|2.0|I started reading the 50 Shades of Grey trilogy after I heard so many people talking about it. Whenever I hear a book getting so much attention, I have to read it to see what all the hype is about.<br /><br />Here's the bottom line: This book is bad. Annoyingly badly written, REPETITIVE, the characters are unlikable, and you will feel dumber after reading it. There is also something addicting about it.<br /><br />The heroine in this book, Anastasia Steele, is awful. I spend most of the book wanting to punch this fictional character. She's whiny, clumsy, stupid, always going back on her word, and ungrateful. But you can tell E.L. James tried to make her into this strong female character. At the end of the first book, Anastasia leaves Christian because he takes her into his \\"Red Room of Pain\\", and spanks her, because SHE ASKS HIM TO. She leaves him, because she just can't take that kind of abuse! In the second book, while biting that lip of hers, she again asks him to do this, and loves it! She's just such a bad girl! The ONLY strong thing she does is leave Christian in the first book, and then she takes him back 5 days later, which leaves the reader angry that they were put through the \\"break up\\" for no reason. And it was barely a break up, she went 5 days without him, and didn't eat or sleep. Thank goodness Christian came along to force feed her! Sigh.<br /><br />Then you have Christian, who is 50 shades of crazy, but he's hot, rich, protective, and romantic. WAY out of Anastasia's league. He does some absolutely crazy things that would make most of us run for the hills, and Anastasia gets mad for a good 30 seconds, but then can't get enough of his gray eyes, the way his pants hang off his hips \\"in that way\\", and they have sex, and everything is marshmallows and rainbows again. Christian is a bazillionaire at 27 (really?), and wants to spend all this money on Anastasia, but she just can't allow it, and will get angry with him when he does things like replace her crappy car, buy her an expensive computer, clothes, etc, etc. There is no female in the world who is going to be courted by a rich guy like this who isn't going to breathe at least a LITTLE sigh of relief over never having to worry about money again.<br /><br />You'll hear a lot of descriptions about how good looking they both are. Actually, you will hear a lot of the same things over and over. Anastasia bites her lip every other page, and Christian always wants to bend her over his knee. Every time she looks at him, she thinks \\"Oh my\\", and they both gasp. A LOT of gasping and smirking happens. Anastasia supposedly studied literature in college, but she always wants him to touch her \\"down there\\" and at the apex of her thighs, but can't come up with a better word for that spot. Then, every once in a while, a big word is thrown in where you know E.L. James had to get out her thesaurus, because she's trying to paint a picture of two fairly intelligent people, but not doing a good job. I had to look up what avuncular was, I admit it.<br /><br />The bottom line: If you are curious, you should read it. You will feel less intelligent afterward, but if you are looking for a mindless fast read, you have found it. Just don't expect any literary genius in these pages. It's also strangely addicting, but I have no idea why.
B000002GXJ|5.0|Great (record company pushed) album that was put together from LIVE shows while the band was on break trying to get THE LONG RUN in the can (only took about 3 years). All the songs are top notch performances that were chosen but big mistake not including Already Gone! How can anyone omit that one? But the quality of what is here is well worth overlooking the skipped Already Gone song.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book is probably the most complicated book I have ever read(besides my history book). I couldn't put it down for a second. I kept going back a couple pages and reading everything that happened over again just to understand what in the world happened. When Gale told Katniss that there wasn't a District 12 anymore I had tears running down my face.... And no I am not afraid to admit that I cried over a book!!

B002BVYBC4|5.0|I love these movies and when this came up as a Black Friday week deal I had to pick it up.  While not one of favorites of the series the blu ray is solid audio and video wise.  If you're a fan...you're probably going to wind up getting it, so just do it :)
B0053O89RY|4.0|Have purchased the 1st and 2nd season on DVD.  I like to watch one episode at a time, instead of simply hitting &#34;play all&#34;  The menu for the episodes is different and not to my liking.  That is my only complaint about the DVD itself, not about the show at all.

But, I like what I like and there are a few songs that didn't do much for me.  Some times albums have a few things I consider &#34;filler&#34; rather than quality music.  But, that is my opinion.<br />Foxy Lady
B0011E9LBI|5.0|I think this movie rocks because of will smiths character & his ability too create his own personality & how he brings out the whole movie with Tommy Lee Jones as his sidekick.
B009KKLQKO|5.0|This is a great show. While like others it would have been nice<br />if they added some of the smile songs,and songs from the 1990's.<br />It's still good to see the surviving members performing again. Also to<br />see DAVID MARKS ,finally getting the credit he deserves. He did do the<br />first five early beach boys albums after AL , left for dental school..<br />Great show.
1932100660|4.0|I'm only giving this 4 stars because I don't want to mislead anyone into thinking that this is &#34;statistics for dummies&#34;. It hasn't been dumbed down any further than absolutely necessary to make it accessible to those with at least a decent high school education.<br /><br />On the other hand, each conclusion presented is supported and anomalies acknowledged. I find this refreshing because it seems like most publicly available scientific writing cherry-picks data to support a given conclusion and then shuffles the 'head scratcher' stuff into oblivion ... never to see the light of day.<br /><br />No guesswork here ... the less meat you eat, the better off you will be over the long haul.
B007XIC1GI|5.0|I first read this book about 9 years ago. I loved reading it again, just as good as I remembered it. It keeps you interested the whole time. I highly recommend.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I recently discovered this series and can't get enough.  I love it and hav trouble waiting for the next episode!
B008TMA1LY|5.0|This is a great game because it is easy for kids and fun. You should definitely try it. Not a ton of annoying ads either. :-)
B0043RSJ8G|5.0|I Absolutely love Jodi Picoult's book!  This one, although very controversial, is also very entertaining as well. The attorney Angela Moretti had me laughing so hard! This book is a must read!
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Great book. Too many things happening and very quickly. Got confusing but in a good way. Finished in less than 5 days
B006MW3V6U|5.0|The writing, acting and cinematography are so fabulous! Can't wait for the next episode!<br />It is rare to find such quality television and makes me really excited to go back to England!
B008602KQI|5.0|I have read all three books of this series.  I was anxious to see the movie and see how closely they followed the book.  Pretty good I think.  I'm anxious for the next 2 movies now.
1451648537|5.0|Great Book and Great Gift. I personally did not read it, but my neice loved it. She's 21-years-old and actually put this on her Christmas list.
B0042C1BP0|5.0|I am a big James Bond fan.  This was Daniel Craig's first roll as 007 and I have to admit I was a little unsure.  But he did a great job and I loved both the movies that followed this one too.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|Case was very stiff, you could not use any of the buttons on my iPhone 4 and the case did not fit the phone properly. I returned it.
B00280LYIC|5.0|I liked this book because it was the best possible book ever!It was very funny and cool. I liked this book because it was very good.
B009FZHYKU|3.0|This show is just starting to get boring. Its too bad as I really liked it at first. Oh well.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|The book had a pretty unique ending that I liked. I thinking everyone would enjoy the end. I did feel that in the last book the story was rushed and went through a lot of the the story that mattered too quickly. The first part in 13 could have been a bit shorter, and the plot between snow, coin, and<br />Katniss could have been played out more; at least between Katniss andcoin before the end.
B0085P2Z6E|5.0|My granddaughter played this from beginning to end without losing interest and moved onto number 2. She had fun searcing for the items.
B005CRQ4GU|2.0|I thought it was good because it held suspense and it has cool pictures and its short and easy to read
B009DCOU9S|5.0|My granddaughter could hardly put it down. The graphics and interior decorations are intriguing and the clues are well hidden.
B00785P2QC|3.0|To be a really good app it has to have certain requirements to me so that is why this game is only a three star game to me.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Not amazing. It's a sample of  a larger game that could be cool. More challenges would be nice. Puzzles, brain teasers etc.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It was a good book I really really liked it I know I will read the whole series now get this now.NOW!!!
B009HQ9UHC|2.0|I brought this game for my grandson. He likes to build things I throught he might enjoy it. I tried playing it, but I do not care that much for it.
0060755598|3.0|You have come a long way from selling encyclopedias.  Whom would have thought you would have  converted those great selling skills and turn them into what you have.  Good work!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Great sequel to Book 1.  Again, the author's writing style is smooth and consistent.  The characters remain true to form and every page is filled with action.  Could not wait to finish to start reading Book 3.
B0090EHVMC|5.0|Rented it first and it was not returned right away , My one granddaughter watches it everyday and laughs and laughs all the time. So I bought it for her and they sent the rental back. Very worth the money!!!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Ms. James does not disappoint in Book 3.  I hated that the story ended, as the author once again, kept the reader engaged from beginning to end.  I look forward to reading other works by this author.
B000FA5SMK|5.0|I love this author and his Characters. This was a really good plot. I would recommend Him to everyone. Thank You John Corey for so many great hours!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I thought that this was a very well written novel.  The characters were extremely likable and the story flowed well.  It was definitely a page turner that sent me straight on to the next book in the trilogy.
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|I now have all the Trek Movies. I will now move on to the series . Can watch them over and over again and love them every time.
B0064T6LV8|1.0|I have this on my iPhone and it is awesome. Horrible on my Kindle Fire HD!! Flippers don't respond properly!!<br />Hopefully they will do an update and fix this.
B009TZ7WDK|5.0|Very nice that included in this album were the Semi-final song and &#34;My Prayer&#34; which they performed in the audition and the finals.  Both songs are performed with much better balance and assuredly in the fashion that they preferred when given the opportunity.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Intriguing book.  Never know what to expect.  Leaves the reader with lots to think about.  Very well written  Get it
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Grisham is always a good story teller.  His books are a fast read and always entertaining.  A very good book!
B007PFD90G|1.0|This book was simply a product for the author to brag about  himself.  Seeing Mr Rushdie on TV prooting the book spurredme to buy it. What a mistake!
B000KKPN5C|5.0|I am extremely satisfied with this flash. I got the flash delivered today & after taking about 10 snaps I can see the world of difference a flash makes to photographs. Works well with D7000. I ordered from B&H since Amazon did not have in their stock & Market place sellers had set prices way higher (approx 30%) than Nikon recommended price. I think Amazon should regulate prices set by market place sellers.<br /><br />As of today this flash will be available on Amazon from 16th Jan 2013.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This is a very comforting book for anyone who has lost someeone dear, whether one is a believer or not<br /><br />Very touching!
B009JBZH54|5.0|The product arrived in a relatively timely fashion, everything was packaged neatly and without defects. the quality of the product speaks for itself. If you're a fan of christopher nolan, batman or a newcomer this trilogy will blow you away. The special features are extensive (for the most part) but my real interest are the movies themselves and viewing them in the highest quality possible is rewarding enough for me. 5 out of 5 stars.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I enjoyed the book, but wasn't as obsessed with it as most of my friends. Pretty good book though, and auto delivered perfectly.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Great game to have when you want a distraction but don't want to spend a long time learning the rules. Fun and just enough of a challenge to keep you coming back for more.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|I really think that d ok me of the other ones were better and I think that he is running out of ideas
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|My niece loves this movie. She actually had me to sit down with her and watch this movie.  I must say that even for an adult, the movie is really cute.
0070511136|5.0|This books helps you understand the process of selling to corporate customers or in general big purchases based on the value they provide to the customer. As disclaimed, this is not the book if you want to understand small item sales. For what it is good however, it really digs deep and puts forward very compelling case studies, and more importantly, gives you a framework to understand what you sell, and who you are selling to. I'm very happy with my acquisition.
B009329Y30|5.0|For those who love romance movies, this is a great movie!! I loved it from beginning to end!! I've never seen either of the actors, but the acting was the best I've seen in years.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|I enjoyed Sharp Objects as much as Gone Girl.  Interesting characters and good plot with a twist.  I highly recommend.
B009HEJXFS|4.0|I must say I was a little disappointed with the movie at first. However, with that being said, I loved the ending of the movie.
0439813786|4.0|Bought this for our daughter. She says it's good read but you really have to pay close attention to the pictures.
B002BWCJOA|5.0|I ordered this movie because my niece wanted to watch it.  She is 4 years old and absolutely loved this movie!!
B007TR1R22|1.0|This flick got some good reviews and I kept thinking, why?  Oh, God, why?  The screenplay didn't work for me.  The sets seem like a backlot.  The acting was superficial.  I didn't believe for one minute that these characters were from the post war period.  Right now they are shouting at each other in a museum - not one other person is there, no one shushes, nothing simmers, they just start shouting like a episode of slutty bitches.  The cinematography is just plain bad on my television.<br /><br />After an hour, I couldn't give a damn about any of them.  It had an interesting violin concerto and I thought, gee, go listen to that.<br /><br />Ahhh, beware the opinions of A.O. Scott.  Who is now on my, What Were You Thinking! list.
B0099G88BE|5.0|.... but I was sufficiently impressed with the mp3 previews on Amazon that I HAD to buy this one.  Absolutely no regrets. This is a very fitting tribute that totally rocks.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Pure Awesome.  Was never a fan of Mac, but with the iPhone and the iPad being two of the most amazing devices I have ever used I wanted to see what this Steve Jobs guy was about.  Genius.
B000I62JBE|4.0|Perhaps it should be The Heist. It's a score, yes, but only for the men involved. It's a big one too, worth 30 million dollars. All lead thief Nick Wells has to do is make it to the basement of the Montr&eacute;al Customs House, break into the safe and get away with a valuable French scepter while partner and House janitor Jack Teller manipulates surveillance cameras from the inside.<br /><br />Of course, it's not quite as easy as it seems. It never really is. That's where layers of criminal-siding tension begin to build. Some of the characterization is overplayed; a computer hacker named Steven is particularly silly; and the romantic side story is unnecessary. But the plot, which mostly consists of compelling planning until the final third, provides a nice pay-off at the end.<br /><br />marcellee.com
B008HK3RVY|4.0|Product came quickly and was accurately listed.  My boys received Fires for Christmas and the cases work really well for them.  I feel they are padded enough for the wear and tear of 6 and 8 year old boys.  They fit snuggly inside and the velcro closure is strong.
B0091REZMW|4.0|this game is so much fun.....but once you are out of diamonds you are screwed. like most games. but I like how there is always something to do.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The best series I've ever read. I completed it all in a few days. Excellently written, it completely engulfs you in the games.  It was a true pleasure.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|In a day when people have &#34;mob mentality&#34; about crime and wanting to quickly blame someone for a crime, Defending Jacob is quite a &#34;can't put it down&#34; book. It depicts the dynamics of families who are effected by accusations in so many ways. I recommend it to anyone interested or effected by juvenile crime.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|well right after it was done downloading it asked me if I wanted to rate it for 250;000 points so I am. I have no idea yet tho cuz I haven't even opened the app yet.<br />however its looking hopeful.
0547564651|1.0|As a parent and a licensed foster parent, I have read lots of parenting books, foster parent books and adoption books.  This book was horrible - lots of clinical studies and stories about disadvantaged students, but no practical advice for parents at all.  Everything I learned from this book was on the cover - grit and character help kids succeed.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Loved this trilogy!Really easy read.Finished them all in four days.I would recommend this book series to anyone that likes adventure.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This is a page turner from the very beginning!  Very good mix of nostalgia and current day culture.  Descriptive and intriguing.  Don't let the number of pages deter you from reading this book.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Fascinating - beautifully written - creates images in ones mind and stimulates thought - I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants their views of faith challanged.
B004A7QOUE|3.0|This is a good prenatal workout, but not the easiest to follow when doing it for the first time.  I've been working out about 4-5 a week from Day 1 of pregnancy and worked out pretty hard before I got pregnant.  Overall it was just an okay workout.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Best series I have ever read. I will be lost now ,in my pursuit ,to find a comparable book. Wish me luck.
1469000431|1.0|Goes on and on about problems, no solutions.  Nothing I had'nt heard before.  It was a total waste of money.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Of all Nicholas Sparks books, this is my favorite. It honestly took my breath away multiple times, made me cry, and made me angry, but I loved every second of it!
B009VLX8FS|5.0|This album did exactly what it was intended to do. Great album from a great, young singer.  She needs to go easy on her private life.
B004JN1CW4|5.0|This book series has put me on an emotional rollercoaster I started this series just before Christmas break ended. Now less than a week later I can state I've finished the trilogy. This book in my opinion is almost better than the hunger if it isn't. I can't wait for the movie but if they screw it up they will never be forgiven. If you have even the slightest interest in action/adventure/mysteries then this book is definitely for you but be prepared for some sleepless nights and a lot of time spent thinking
B005H0IW6W|5.0|I was surprised by how many songs are on the album and the variety of<br />the music. It will be among my favorites of the season.
B002RI9ZPY|3.0|I will presume that the reader of this review knows the first two books in the series and wants to know if the ending holds up well. That seriously depends on expectations. If you, like me, believe that Larsson opened up the curtains too far wide at the second chapter in the trilogy, perhaps it will come as no surprise that his third and final foray in long-form fiction blasts further away from Lisbeth Salander and into political drama seeped in Swedish Cold-War history. She is more of a robotic centerpiece for other characters' worries than the striding antihero we've come to appreciate, spending most of her time as a hospital denizen with all the action happening around her, in orbits placing FAR too many Swedish law enforcement  officers and street names to even matter. Her back story and family relations are clearly brought to light and there's closure; on the other hand, the book puts so many parallel lines running along that you can't help but feel it could lose some of its 600 pages and gain focus. In the end, you feel more relieved that the whole monster is over than actually satisfied with the balance of themes finally developed to completion -- most of them, anyway.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|just like the big arcade game-drop your coins and it scoots them over the edge for extra coins and prizes. something to relax and have a little fun with when not doing much or before bedtime.
B001DJ7PR8|5.0|The movie was in perfectly new condition. It even had the plastic wrapping still on the case. It's a beautiful yet hilarious film.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|these birds are someting else and a lot of fun shooting thru the air hitting things. the premier of the birds. have fun.
B009TZ7WDK|4.0|Great songs. Very nice music. They are both very talented with great voices at such a young age. The quality of mp3 recording is not impressive though.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|a very good reader for books, pdf and doc files i have found as well. simple and easy to use. one of the best i have found so far.  if you read and do any sort of documents and files, i would highly suggest you consider this if using a kindle fire or an android tablet.
B003MC5N28|4.0|This was my second time reading the book. I am 21 now and read it originally when I was 12. The story is an interesting concept and take on the value of freedom. The material caters to an older audience but the writing style is better suited for teens.
B00362DRN6|5.0|I just received this 2 disc deluxe set as a gift.  I'd read the complaints about glitches and the mastering, but I honestly don't hear any glitch nor find the mix to be problematic.  I love the bonuses on disc 2!  Those demos and BBC session tracks are well worth it for a hardcore fan!<br /><br />The mix itself doesn't stand out as being any better or worse than my 2003 edition of the album.  One thing to note, my 2003 single disc sleeve contains lyrics, this sleeve does not, but does feature cool photos of the band.
0765325950|4.0|It's like David Eddings took the helm of a Tad Williams series.  Sanderson has even tweeted that as a teenager Eddings was one of his favorite authors (as was Jordan).<br /><br />This isn't necessarily a bad thing, as many reviewers of Sanderson's WOT books point out.  I share Sanderson's love of Eddings; he had an efficient writing style that moved the plot along, and Sanderson is also gifted in this regard.  Sanderson is also far better at injecting humor into the narrative than Jordan, for whom humor always seemed awkward and forced.<br /><br />So \\"A Memory of Light\\" is a good read, and I was entertained, even gripped at times, but I still found myself missing Robert Jordan with every page.  He rarely explained in detail why characters did anything, preferring the reader to interpret from a character's (often conflicting) actions.  Jordan used POV to enhance the fog of war, not to burn it off.  The end result was a community of readers that spent decades unraveling mysteries about who did what and why.<br /><br />Sanderson, meanwhile, uses \\"observer\\" characters in every scene (often the POV character) to clarify exactly what was happening, and even go one step further by voicing explicit credit to any character doing something awesome.<br /><br />This constant affirmation is in direct contrast to Jordan's philosophy, where the hero is not only unsung but (mostly) wishes to remain so.  Jordan, a former soldier with many more years of wisdom than Sanderson, hewed closer to the idea that rewards for courage were usually given posthumously.  Momentous and daring achievements in the WOT were met with skepticism, scorn, jealousy, or at best a pat on the head.  Sanderson (or maybe Harriet?) seems to have been frustrated about this for a while, as Brandon feels the need to compliment and credit characters for their achievements on nearly every page.  There's even a scene where Mat and Rand banter about their resumes in a friendly game of oneupmanship.<br /><br />The endresult is a feel-good book that brings the series to a satisfying conclusion, but is completely devoid of the \\"real world\\" gravitas that made reading the Wheel of Time such a life changing experience for millions.
B005C4ERHQ|5.0|You need to read it if you work in an office and would like to know what your strengths are as a team player..
B00AA7O22U|1.0|Not at all good .It was really a horrible, horrible horrible horrid disappointing waste of the families time to watch . No age or gender liked it.
B008Y1YK9Y|5.0|Again, another great movie in the tradition of Men in Black.  If you liked the first two you will also like this latest adventure of the series.
B005K17RU0|4.0|I love having wind, precip, temp, etc all on one page and I also love the temp in the top bar of the phone.  I gave it a 4 since I find accuweather not as accurate as some of the others.
B005LAIIPS|5.0|Bourne Legacy is an excellent movie.  This movie continues in the path of the original Bourne movies.  It has a lot of action and suspense.
B0091REZMW|5.0|fun game..I have had it for awhile and just started playing it and haven't been putting my kindle down much. worth the download.
B0063GORYU|4.0|This game is fun and challenging!  Would recommend to people of all ages. All of its hints and deals keep you engaged; always ready for a good time. This is a great free app!
B007HACDLK|5.0|Another great Mitch Rapp novel which re-introduces a character from previous books.  The character re-introduced here is one that I hoped to hear more about.If you have read the previous novels, you should have an idea about who it is. Flynn also provides insight into a more &#34;human&#34; Mitch. The action is fast paced, full of intrigue & treachery.  This is Vince Flynn at his best.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|This is much more than a board game. It's a people game. Sure, it's a game of economics and chance, but that's not what makes it great. What makes it great are the allies and enemies you make over the course of a game or many games (if you're like me and play this a lot). It's interesting to see if people are trustworthy, liars, aggressive, passive, gregarious, unilateral, etc.; it's just fun to see people get worked up over a board game. The rules are relatively easy to learn and strategies are somewhat easy to pick up on. Then it's a game of chance and how well you can work with and against people. Games take about an hour. Very fun. Highly addictive!
B004K4IZ3G|5.0|This movie is as visually stunning as the first movie was back in 1982 when it came out. The first tron movie was at least 20 years ahead of its time and this sequel is just the same in its timeliness. The story and plot are excellent and keeps you hanging on the edge of your seat. I loved the disc-fight scenes and the character development because there were several new characters introduced to the story line as it continued from the first movie. Jeff Bridges is always first-rate in his acting and he gets into character extremely well. He and the other actors were very convincing and the plot development along with how it related to the different characters was captivating from beginning to end. The visuals in this movie are so stunning that it makes you want to watch it again and again just to see that particular aspect of the movie. So in that respect it is just how the first Tron movie was. They really outdid themselves with this one. The price of this two-disc set is excellent. I would recommend this movie and disc-set to anyone.
B001F0WXY0|5.0|I first read the chronicles of dune 12 years ago, to be ready fr sci-fi's release if their miniseries. The book remains a standard for the scifi genre
B009OYSFDM|5.0|I think they did a decent job with this show. The Green Arrow was not always the top pick for DC Comics fans, so I was pleasantly surprised to see the show based around this character. Hope this does well and hope to see more like this in the future. Very entertaining.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Works very well on my Kindle Fire. Love a free game that is problem free! Lots of options for card backs and types of games.
B009HV2JT8|4.0|If you are a fan of vampire movies.You will enjoy this movie.If you are not sure about the abraham lincoln thing.You will get past it.He is a hero to the american people in the first place.He is not just fighting vampires.He is protecting america.It is a very good looking movie.With the locations of the south.The shots of D C,and the white house.Abe was know for his speeches.This movie is very good in the action department and his speeches don't get in the way.The scenes with the horses and the train are something to see.Don't forget tim burton had his hand in this movie.Abe is great with the ax.

B00A3VLJCE|2.0|I wouldn't buy it.  I couldn't upload my Photoshop Express picture to it.  That's ridiculous!!  So far, I wasn't successful with any real edit.
030758836X|3.0|*** Spoilers ***<br /><br />I rarely write reviews on books, but this one sort of made me want to for several reasons. I'm in the group of people who liked about three fourths of this book and then thought it went horribly wrong. I say this not because I had to have a \\"happy\\" ending or because I needed Amy to be punished and Nick to be vendicated. People get away with things, that's for sure. Sometimes all the characters are crazy people. Good doesn't always win out and I can accept that.<br /><br />Here is what I can't accept. Amy is so brilliant that she has planned all of this out in such a meticulous manner that she has everyone fooled (except of course Nick, Go and Nick's lawyer). She spent a year getting ready. She has every detail down to a science, fakes names on Credit Cards, elaborately buys and stores TV's, golf clubs, all sorts of stuff without ever once being noticed. Yet, barely a week or two into hiding, two rubes steal all her money. Well, we can always say, \\"Amy never knew how to deal with money! She never hung out with riff-raff!\\" Yeah, she never hung out with detectives either, but she knows everything about them. She goes into some sketchy, run-down hovel and is so shocked that two down-and-out rednecks would betray her and steal from her! She kept her money in a bag around her chest? Are you kidding me? She pulled said bag out while paying for hot dogs and got spotted? Geeze Amy, you sure got slack and careless awfully quick. You, the person who took the time to put your husband's fingerprints on stolen goods got ripped off because you can't find a good place to hide ten thousand dollars! Uh, how about the trunk of your car? At least hide the majority somewhere you only go in the dead of night when you know you aren't being followed.<br /><br />Okay, I can get past that too, I guess. But just barely.<br /><br />Amy is crazy, that is for sure. But, she is also supposed to be so intelligent that she is almost robotic. Nick makes a couple of confessions, gives her that look and touches the cleft in his chin and wham! She has to go back! Eh, I guess we could forgive her for being \\"in love\\" with this guy (but, was she ever?). Now that he's said he's sorry, it's time for a new plan! Hmmm, problem is, she only has a day or two to figure it out. Because living in Desi's lake house was not part of the original, elaborate plan. Blaming everyhing on Desi was ALSO not part of the original plan. But hey, let's see how it works out!<br /><br />And so it goes. Amy figures out real quick how to fake rape, make it look like she's been tied up for weeks, etc. etc. etc. Gosh, I hope Amy got her fingerprints off all the places she left them in the lake house she was tied up in! Maybe we can forget about that too, although it's getting pretty ugly. And full of holes.<br /><br />Still, there is another thing that sticks bad with me. I mean really, really bad. For one thing, it never really says where the lake house is located. Or maybe I missed it? Yes, it is in Missouri somewhere, near enough for Desi to drive to. But, who says it is in the same jurisdiction this other crime took place in? Where is that connection? Everyone keeps expecting Boney to do something and charge Amy. Is this lake house supposed to be in the same area where Nick and Amy live? The same cops who investigated Amy's disappearance would be the ones called out to investigate Desi's murder/death? But again, here is the clincher. Nick was told by the detectives unequivocably, with no doubt - Desi was not a suspect in Amy's disappearnce! He is not a suspect, Nick. Nick, he is not a suspect. That means he had a rock solid alibi. They went and questioned him and said, \\"Oh, thank you for your time sir, and by the way, where were you that morning? Playing tennis with your Mom at the club? Thank you.\\" Amy killed a guy not knowing whether he could even be implicated in her abduction? Little Ms. Planner of the Century? I'm supposed to believe that? I suppose she justasked him what he was doing the day of her disappearance and he said, \\"Oh, I was driving around your neighborhood. Where else would I be?\\" Nobody checked that out? How convenient! And that just doesn't work. That's why the ending blows.<br /><br />Great writing. Very cool idea. Blew the ending.

B0031Y4ALC|5.0|I have loved this one since it's original release. With the newest remaster and vinyl release, it is like i'm listening with new ears. This release was meant to be heard on vinyl. If you've only ever heard the .mp3 version of this album, you are missing out. It has a fold out with each record stored in a nice cardboard color sleeve. Each sleeve contains lyrics to the songs on that record.<br /><br />I don't have any complaints for this one. If you like this album definitely go buy it. If you don't like this album, you likely haven't heard the vinyl version.
B009186E3O|5.0|It was the perfect gift thanks.It Came just in time for christmas time.i would gladly purchase again with no hesitation
B005MVIF7M|5.0|I bought this because I&#34;m a fan of Wilco and it was $5. Amazon will make you work to actually download these songs. I would think, just clicking buy, would start my download and allow me to put my album on iTunes or my various music devices. This is not how it went.<br /><br />I don't remember every specific step, but roughly, I of course clicked the 1-click purchase button. then I went to my &#34;cloud&#34; and searched through to find the album i just purchased. I checked the entire album to download. apparently I then had to download Amazon's download/player combo dealy, then it started downloading the album. so, now i start the amazon app and finally the music is there. I think the player put it in itunes as well or i moved it via my folders.<br /><br />the entire process is confusing and i gotta say, if i'm not saving money by buying music on amazon, i'm not buying music on amazon. it's just too easy on iTunes. what is the real benefit of buying music if the process is so confusing and exaggerated?
093183841X|5.0|This classic camera price guide is very informative. I am already looking forward to the next edition to be released soon.
B000003R7G|4.0|I love this album. I won't try to convince you to love it. If you also love it, buy the vinyl version. I paid $7.98 and it's 2 LP version, so i was very surprised at the great quality. the only things i would note, and you know one of these if you ever heard this album, some songs have vinyl &#34;crackle/pop&#34; purposely put on the original recording. I only note this, because obviously you wouldn't want this one a new vinyl record. It's not on all the songs.<br /><br />if I had any complaints, it's that the two records are jammed into one slot, in paper sleeves. this might be why it's so cheap. as opposed to a gatefold with color sleeves from other 2 LP releases. It's not a huge deal and doesn't effect play or sound that I've noticed.
B006MW3V6U|1.0|I find it horrible that Amazon charges for an hour of Downton Abbey that I can get free on PBS.org.<br />I had previously watched this episode and mistakingly thought it was the last one for the season offered by Amazon and paid for it.<br />Each time I have a problem with Amazon, I get closer to never using them again but<br />I am just a small grain of rice in your huge following.<br />I do not like it is so difficult to communicate with your customer service.<br /><br />I now need to know how you are connected with TiVo as I just purchased one and they seem to push a lot of Amazon<br />purchases.<br />Thanks for your time.<br />C.

B007W8S2MG|5.0|I never thought I'd be playing the same(with some slight changes and new additions) 90+ hour game again, but this one has pulled me back in almost as if I was playing it for the first time.<br /><br />Story/characters: One of the strong points (of many) of this game is its awesome and unique murder mystery story and equally unique characters. First of all this is one of those rare instances where the dubbing is actually respectable, which is a slight consolation considering that there is no Japanese language option. With the collective voice talent behind this game the performances for the characters are well done just as they were in the ps2 version. The first 3 hours or so are dedicated to setting up the story, which may seem like a long while, but considering how long this game is, it will be like a drop in the bucket. From here the story moves along with hardly any drag throughout the game.<br /><br />Which leads into the in between activities that fill the time in between story sections. This game takes place over the course of a school year and man is there a lot to do to pass that time. The game revolves around social links that you establish with many of Inaba's(the game's setting)interesting characters. Being that you're a high school student, you'll connect with many characters through activities such as playing sports, working at a youth club (yes, you can even take on part time jobs), joining the music team, etc. Spending time with characters tied to each of those activities increases that respective social link level which will impact combat (more on that to come). This doesn't seem like the chore that it sounds like as again the voice talent comes through so that you care about your interactions and dealings with each character that you come across throughout this amazing journey. Throughout this part you'll learn about people's lives in a way that will most likely cause you to care about what happens to them.<br /><br />Combat: This is another area where the game really shines. In combat your character will make use of summoned monsters called Personas. In combat you will be joined by 2 other companions who have personas of their own with more characters and Personas becoming available as you progress in the story (you as the main character can summon multiple Personas, while the supporting cast only has one each). Combat flows nicely which is turn based, but with some interesting mechanics thrown into the mix. Usually in the course of a battle you will try to find the enemy's weakness so that you can exploit it. By doing this you can knock a bad guy down(they can do the same if they figure out your weakness too), knock them all down and you set your team up for an all out attack which is really cool to watch as you see your characters pummel the bad guys in a cloud of dust :). At the end of combat you will sometimes get the chance to pick cards that will give you bonuses ranging from extra money and experience,new personas, to actually leveling up your currently selected persona on the spot. This is a welcome change from the ps2 version that only allowed you to pick one card at the end of a match. Interestingly enough, if you manage to select all the cards (you get a limited number of selections unless you pick a card that grants you extra selections) this will carry over to the next battle granting you a guaranteed card selection after the next battle (another change from the PS2 version).<br /><br />Lastly come the persona fusions that you make to create stronger and more versatile personas to add to your collection for battles. This is where those social links mentioned above to which personas are tied to categorically come in handy as the more that you level up social links, the more substantial the reward (greater amount of xp that is immediately given to the persona upon its creation which is important for them learning new skills) becomes as you fuse new personas together. A nice change from the PS2 version is that you are now able to select which skills you can pass on to the new persona that you are making which alleviates the chore of changing your persona fusion combinations until you get the persona that you want. Needless to say, this along with many of the other aspects of the game are absolutely robust which is how this game lasts for as long as it does.<br /><br />Summary: This is an amazing game if you're willing to put in the time and it has definitely become one of my favorite games of all time. If you're looking for a game that will give you a lot of bang for your buck, look no further. With its engrossing characters, story, deep and robust combat and persona creation system, this is truly one of the best JRPGs (and game in general) ever imo and was pretty much the reason I bought the PS Vita even though I had already completed it on PS2. And lastly,you are able to select the difficulty to make the game as hard or as easy as you want. Cheers, and enjoy what is soon to be if not already a classic.

0062060554|4.0|This book intriged me from the moment I saw it's cover.  The more I read it, the more I needed to get through it.  I love happy<br />endings so I was glad it had a good ending even though it was left to your imagination which way her life would go.  I could not<br />put it down after I got so far into it.  I love the fact that it kept you guessing what was really happening to her.  Excellent writing.
B005LAII3U|1.0|My last review was about amazons delivery problems. Apparently amazon doeant appreciate their customers opinions and concerns. My last comment was totally appropriate. I guess amazon doesnt need other.customers to know the problems amazon has with on time delivery. But amazon refused to post my comment.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Another wonderful book from Sparks. Its a page turned, filled with mystery, love, and strategy. You won't want to put it down.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Finding the series through Amazon was easier than other video Wifi sources.  The first episode was free and then had to buy the series to see the next.  Good system to be able to determine if you want to invest.
B0094U0RJQ|1.0|This album stinks. I don't know what to say for ten more words. It sounds awful, the mixing is bad, you can't understand anything, there's maybe one listenable song.
B009G7ZYPY|4.0|I loved the preview of this online but the actual version was slightly disappointing in comparison. This is because the voice is beautiful and technically good but the emotions a little bland. Elaine Paige is so much better obviously as she had a lot of experience onstage. However I enjoyed this album a lot especially with the duets with Donny their voices  are well matched and he puts so much emotion in .
B004XDYJRU|5.0|On some holiday deal. It works well, stable. I haven't found a radio station yet that isn't carried on this app.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I liked the whole book from beginning to end. I would recommend it and would re-read. You wont be sorry.
B005LAII80|5.0|First off let me just start by saying that i had no previous experience with the Judge Dredd series or Comic books. I went to the midnight premiere expecting this movie to be a horrible remake of the previous one with Stallone. By the end of the movie however i can say with absolute confidence that i had become a fan of the Judge Dredd series.<br />From the beginning to the very end this movie left me with anticipation for what would happen next and when it was over I was simply upset that there wasn't more to see. Defiantly a must see!, I promise you that you wont regret it!.<br />Karl Urban is an amazing Dredd and i look forward to seeing him in a possible sequel.
B000JQU1VS|4.0|Read every short story and was surprised at the ending. Well written. Good Characterization. Imaginative. I would recommend this book and might re-read.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|I would definitely recommend this set of movies - great value :) Read the books, watch the movies, you will love them.
1452111014|4.0|According to the movie opening times seem to buy a good one.<br />Good material to practice a variety of character, I think.
034580404X|4.0|Okay, anyone who tells you this is great literature is lying to you.  It is poorly written and hardly worth the paper it is printed on.  IF you want smut and something to read to spice up your sexual life this could help.<br />I would read it again.
B001AMNL2Q|5.0|Great! Intense,. Not for kids. Wonderful piece of film making. I am trying to fill up 15 words-- don't have em.

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|No wonder this series is so popular. Everything invites us to imagine we are part of the story, living in the time and place of it all.
B001TH8UUA|5.0|I've been using one of these cables for my PS3 for over a year now, and everything is still working well. I think that's all you can ask for out of a cable, and there's really no need to pay anything more than this.
B00A9X9ORI|2.0|The idea was interesting, but it was overly graphic.  Sad how movies are all about fitting in the gore and sex, but focus so little on quality now.

1401323952|5.0|This is an excellent book and one that i am happy to have in my collection. i will look for more by Nigella
0399157565|1.0|I used to love Patricia Cornwell and Kay Scarpetta was one of my favorite continuing characters.  I looked forward to this book, because initial reviews indicated that it went back to basics, reconstructed the old Kay and her forensice insights and skills.  Nothing could be farther from the truth.  The dialogue was so repetitive that I found myself skipping paragraphs, something I never do, out of sheer boredom.  There was nothing early on to engage my interest, no significant plot twists until the end and a contrived ending that just came out of the blue.  None of the forensics was helpful in identifying the perpetrator, the person was not even a part of 95% of the book, and even the climax lacked any tension or concern.  If you like dialogue you will love this book - it is interminable, repetitive and inane.  If you like a good read with plot development, suspense and interesting characters, you are in the wrong venue.  Sorry Ms. Cornwell, you are capable of much better than this.
B009HEJXFS|5.0|Normally I watch sequels with trepidation, expecting to be disappointed. Not so with this series! This third installment of the MIB movies is very entertaining and even enlightening! Josh Brolin is brilliant as a young K and the special creature effects are amazing. If you haven't seen it yet, don't wait any longer, you'll LOVE it.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|Fantastic Show, Looking forward to the continued episodes. Others are much better suited to write reviews, but I'm an all around comedy, drama, Sci-Fi admirer and OUaT is a wonderful series! Love the service amazon provides so I could catch up on all the un-viewed episodes!
B0053KWDES|4.0|I love my Sennheiser 555 headphones, but low output amps don't. All the bass goes away when I listen to my iPhone, iPod, or laptop. The mids and highs are still amazing but there's little low end.<br />Along comes the FiiO E11 amp. Reading the specs it sounds perfect. (I should note here that the specs are a little misleading. There is no low / high - as in low frequency / high frequency - which is what I assumed. It is instead low gain / high gain -- low for low ohm buds and headphones, high gain for buds and headphones over 100 ohms. This is an important selling feature and I'm surprised they are not clear on it AND there are three bass boost settings, none/some/more - couldn't find the exact db ratings). Back to the specs -- 10-100000hz? Are you kidding me? I expected the sound to be crystal clear just as if I were plugged directly into the source.<br />Unfortunately, that is not the case. I couldn't figure out why until I realized that the amp uses the headphone output of the device for its input. Naturally there's a lot of loss. Consequently the sound is not as good as I expected. Its not that its bad, the low end is definitely improved (NOT earth-shaking, bone crushing bass, but a nice mellow boost) but the mids and highs  definitely suffer. Now, I admit this may be more noticeable because of the Sennheiser's sensitivity to mids and highs, I don't know.<br />So these are my two suggestions to FiiO -- you've got a great idea and its almost there.<br />1 - the input should be combo headphone/ IR just as iPods, iPhones and laptops are. That should eliminate the noise and loss and resolve the review digs others have left about the connecting cable.<br />2- We REALLY need to be able to use the amp WHILE ITS CHARGING. Four hours to charge? Are you kidding? How can anyone go without their music for FOUR HOURS!  Just sayin'<br />Overall, I like it better than the alternative (doing without).
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Through a series of letters written to someone we only know as \\"Dear Friend\\", we live with Charlie as he experiences life as a High School freshman...and all that it entails.<br />The reference to \\"wallflower\\" is based on the fact that Charlie is usually the \\"observer\\" of life around him. He struggles to \\"participate\\" in life. And life is a struggle as he becomes exposed to its darker side (abortion, rape, suicide, molestation, alcohol, drugs, unplanned pregnancies, domestic violence, homosexuality, peer pressure, etc.)<br />These elements are not maudlin or extemperaneous, they are an important part of Charlie's maturity.<br />We also get glimpses of Charlie's past psychiatric experiences and we worry along with him as to whether \\"it is all going to start again\\"<br />The author has created a wonderful cast of characters who are well developed and seem genuine. I enjoyed watching these relationships as Charlie matures.<br />In one point in the story, after watching an art file with Mary Elizabeth, Charlie say \\"the movie itself was very interesting, but I didn't think it was very good because I didn't feel different when it was over\\". I felt different after reading this book - and that is good.<br />Kudos to Mr. Chbosky for a wonderful first novel.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|I have also had a similar experience.that totally changed my life and beliefs but we arrived at different beliefs. My experience led me to believe that we become like a drop of water dropped into a pail of water therefore becoming a part of the whole.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|As an adult I wondered if I would enjoy a \\"teen\\" book.  I'm now hooked.  The premise is good and the murder is tastefully written.  I am going to be reading the next two in the series.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is so addicting I love playing it its awesome seeing how high of a score you can get
B00005LK94|5.0|This is a wonderful film. Every family should watch it if they have a chance. Jeff Daniels and (a very young) Anna Paquin are remarkable.
B00005U122|5.0|This DVD is unreal......Saw this at my brother in laws house, he ordered it for us...can't tell you how many times we watched it...over and over.  I purchased this one for my daughter and son in law, bought another a few months ago, for my brother who was visiting and he loved it...It is amazing....Remembering pink floyd, and now hearing through Roger Waters, it is by far the best DVD and I live in Oregon, and would have given anything to have been at this concert in Portland, Or.....<br /><br />I encourage anyone from he 60's, buy this DVD, if you saw it you would......its priceless and timeless.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|What a beautiful story! I will admit it was a little slow building up the suspense but wow was it worth it!! The ending was simply perfect and I feel moved just from reading it. Definitely a Nicholas sparks fan.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|Coelho' s story of a young boy's search is filled with simple,  wise messages about courage, faith, and fear.  It's about living with the Heart as guide.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I thought it was a awesome book and I would recommend it to kids 12 and up I thought that the best part of the book was when they were on the train going back to district 12.
B001OQCV2O|2.0|This movie was cool... before it was 2013. Now it's just another movie about a disaster that was supposed to happen but didn't so we can look forward to a remake the next time we think the world is going to end. The 2 stars are for Woody being in the movie.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|with 3 different ways to play you can find a chalenge in each.  the more you play the more you want to beat your previous score.
B009B8YZKS|4.0|This movie is NOT about what happens leading up to HALO 4 aside from a 5 min intro and a 3 min outro. It is about the future commander of the UNSC Infinity, Commander Laskey. It take place around the same time period as Reach when the UNSC was still training soldiers to fight the Human Rebellion. They did not know the covenant even existed during the first half of this movie as well as in the start of Halo:Reach. So when the covenant shows up the cadets don't even know what they are. Anyway... the movie has all the covenant races in it for at least a little while and they all look awesome (Even the HUNTERS!)<br />Master Chief is in the end for a while also... They did a great job of bringing Halo to life.
B009O2XY12|5.0|very challenging and the more you play the more you wat to play.  I find it hard to put it doewn

0385344333|5.0|Lee Child is one of the best writers in modern literature; I have read just about everything and will stand behind this statement.  This seller delivered my book in pristine condition in a timely fashion and I would do business with this seller again in the beat of a heart.  I am intensely grateful for the excellence of my brain and imagination because Hollyweird has sought to bastardize and immolate the great works of Child.  I hope the royalty checks were worth it.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I read all 3books and it was a great read! I appreciated the the language that the author used, the old English gave the book a great romantic feel! Can't wait until the next book by E L James<br />Ebony.lottjohnson
037582913X|5.0|My 3 year old boy loves this book. One of his favorites! A classic story that should be in every child's library.

B009LXEBD4|5.0|Very happy with this purchase.  This is the first purchase of Kelly's music but I hear her all the time on the radio.  First CD played in our new truck and I don't get tired of it.
B008BD9SI8|5.0|Another great book from Joe Abercrombie.  Even more reflective on the pointlessness and circularity of war and violence than preceding novels.  And, of course, engaging story and characters you are interested in.
B0012TWRAO|5.0|This is a very neat mount. The kit comes with 2 u-brackets to fit smaller and fatter bars which is nice.

0446693804|4.0|I find that whenever I read a book by Nicholas Sparks, I always find myself crying.. I don't even bother to watch the movies after The Notebook came out.<br />The book is great at best and in certain parts is pretty boring.. In my opinion, it takes a while in certain chapters for the author to get to the point.
B00APUQT7I|5.0|I loved all of the ice age movies, very good family entertainment  can be.All the characters are so funny and the storyline teaches children how important family
B0036EH3UC|4.0|I was reluctant to purchase this considering I knew this show had become highly sexually suggestive in comparison to the original Battlestar Galactica from the 80's.  However, my 8 year old loved the original from the 80's and I succumbed to his pressure for me to obtain the rewrite.  I was correct in this series not being suitable for young kids thus I do not permit him to watch it alone; I sit through every episode with him with my finger on the remote ready to forward through inappropriate scenes.  The good news is we both like the show a lot & it is very entertaining.  It is a shame they made the show sexually suggestive because it could have appealed to young & older viewers both (in my opinion) without it.  I do recommend purchasing the Blu-Ray instead of this (if you can) because I do see quite a few imperfections in the quality of the picture compared to what I am used to.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Keeps me in suspense all the time. I feel like I am addicted to it. It is so hard to wait to see the next episode.!

B006MMVV7Q|5.0|I remember the smurfs from my youth...:::sigh:::...I don't have any kids in the house so watching this was purely a nostalgic event. The characters were all done very well! And you really can't go wrong with N.P.H!!!
0316228532|4.0|I really loved this story of life in a grubby little town. The only weakness was that no character was positive enough for the reader to root for. This is a true Naturalistic novel where no one wins and everyone loses.

B009E3EY38|5.0|They haven't lost anything. They are still the incredible live band they were back in the 60's and 70's. Just phenomenal all the way around. Jimmy is still himself, Plant sounded a bit weak during &#34;Good Times Bad Times&#34;, but then once he warmed up he sounded amazing. John Bonham did his father justice and JPJ was what he always is.

1582701709|2.0|This book has been out for many years, so people surely have heard all the pros and cons.<br />I'll cut to the quick of it.<br />The Law of Attraction has been around for a long while. Rhonda Byrne got rich by making up a phoney baloney story that entertained and informed millions and I am happy she did! I'd like to have her booksales! We're all adults here, pretty much and should be over the nonsense by now!<br />She introduced people to a subject done much better by others. and copies are pretty darn cheap by this time.<br />For better reading try the books by the Hicks. especially Ask and It Is Given.
0765325950|5.0|I read A Memory of Light yesterday in pretty much one-sitting. It was quite the experience...and it was quite a fitting ending for an already remarkable series. The action does not really stop throughout the entire book and sometimes it feels a little like a roller-coaster ride, but it was good. It was fun.<br /><br />Part of me is sad that it is all finally over. And it really is the end...there will be no more Wheel of Time books coming out...and the storyline has been wrapped up. However, I feel extremely satisfied with the ending. It was wrapped up beautifully and with style. Yes, there are some questions left unanswered at the end...but then, when aren't there? Some questions are not meant to be answered. Mostly, however, my questions were answered as fully as I wanted them to be.<br /><br />Sanderson took the reigns with the Gathering Storm and is laying them down again after finishing A Memory of Light. He did a marvelous job and I applaud him for his excellent work. This is a series that I cherish and I hope you all get a chance to read the ending. It is worth the journey.
B009G78EE2|5.0|This album is fantastic. The horns, rhythms, rhymes, all of it. I love when I find an album that I can listen all the way through with out wanting to skip a song.
B002NANLCE|3.0|The writing was good, a bit labored.  The premise of the book though similar was markedly different than the show.  The show flashed forward about six months at a time, the book about 30 years.  Even so, very good concept.  The whole second flash forward seemed a bit of a let down with no real need for it.  Wow, we evolve into star light and the universe, what a completely overused concept.
B004V6MWFU|2.0|My review will echo a lot of the other 1 and 2-star reviews.  I love Eddie, don't care for this album much.  I don't mind the ukulele, but I don't care for the key that Eddie sings most of the songs in, nor do I care for the tempo he sings them in as well. He seems to have a very limited range of what he can play on the uke, because every song pretty much sounds the same (or similar, at least).<br /><br />To those of you who were able to find good in this album, with the 5-star reviews, kudos to you.  I'm glad you were able to enjoy it, because I just couldn't get into it. I gave it a valiant effort, but ultimately, had to surrender to the fact that I just didn't like it.  \\"Into the Wild\\", I loved.  \\"Ukulele Songs\\", not for me.
B004UO0SAO|5.0|We needed a general all purpose calculator for our Kindle/Android devices.  It would have been nice if it had a simple skin as well, I miss the equal sign, but other than that great product.  It is the second scientific calculator app we have downloaded.  This is far superior.

B005LAII80|5.0|I rented this the other night and then put in an order for it. I had seen the Stallone version and was very hesitant to see the new movie in the theater. Dredd seems to be a more realistic look at what the future could be and less comic bookish than the Stallone one. The acting is good and the plot doesn't lose itself (unlike Prometheus). There isn't a lot of character development, but the movie has a lot of atmosphere. As far as recent action movies, I hated GI Joe, Transformers, and the Titan movies, but liked Total Recall and John Carter.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|I am very pleased with the Kindle Fire cable, which the Amazon/Kindle service representative recommended.  My Kindle--even though it is not a Kindle Fire--charges perfectly now.  I would highly recommend this product.

B00913DPW2|3.0|This was beautifully designed and the graphics are amazing for a free app. We had a hard time getting into the house, but I'm sure it's because we lacked motivation to figure it out. Great game.
B00005AR3G|5.0|This is my 5 year old's favorite movie.  This story is hilarious and the voices of David Spade and Co. are perfect for the characters.  It's also visually beautiful.

B004V01VUS|5.0|Stardust is a short (literally) but endearing story about a young man's search for love. Tristram Thorne is a seemingly ordinary boy who is madly in love with Victoria Forrester, the town's egotistical beauty. She dares Tristram to bring her back a fallen star, which sets him on a quest away from his comfortable home and out into the wider world of Faerie, which lies just beyond the town boundaries. Soon, the boy encounters others who are as interested in the fallen star as he - a witch queen hoping to restore her youthfulness; and a trio of royal brothers seeking to determine which shall rule--but more ruthless about getting their hands on the prize.<br /><br />Nail Gaiman reads the audio book and provides a fascinating interview about writing the book. Gaiman has a professional's reading voice and is enchanting as he spins his own story. \\"Stardust,\\" he tells us, was written as a fairy tale for grown-ups. And it certainly is dark - more sexy and violent than a kid's story by far. There is death, betrayal, slavery and murder galore. But also longing, naïvet&eacute; and sweet, sweet love.<br /><br />\\"Stardust\\" is superbly crafted, tying up loose ends you were not even aware were dangling. A brilliant example of the storyteller's art, with a bevy of lovable and fearsome characters that will charm your heart away.

0547569653|5.0|Really enjoyed this book not just from a runner or foodie stand point, although loved it for those reasons too, but from a human perspective.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I have been an emotional wreck reading this book for the past two days! Colleen Hoover has a great way of creating characters that make you care about them. My heart broke for them while at the same time I was rejoicing for the love they found. As the pieces of the story fell into place, they were often not what I expected.<br /><br />There is a lot to love about this book. It's a compelling, emotional story of survival, loss, love & most importantly hope.

B009NQKPUW|3.0|If this is considered an Alien movie, it might be worse than previous cellar dweller Resurrection (not including AVP and AVP2, those are completely out of my ranking).<br /><br />If this is not considered an Alien move, its a pretty decent flick!
B00A757EFW|3.0|It is more for kids than adults. I got bored pretty quick. If my grandkids were here I would think t hey would love it.
0316017930|2.0|The book should be prefaced with \\"Malcolm Gladwell is not a scientist and has no scientific training.\\"  He has an interesting theory, but supports it with weak anecdotal evidence and incorrect generalizations while completely ignoring the many shortcomings and counter evidence.  An interesting read, but don't take what he says too seriously.

It was worth it.  Anyone with children that haven't seen it should look into it, great story and very funny with Robin Williams as the Genie.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Great read, very interesting, she does a great job of presenting the story of what happened.  New insite for me.
1451638450|5.0|In this book, Ivan Vorpatril finally emerges from the comic shadows of the Vorkosigan saga and joins the pantheon of great heroes, as all of Bujold's protagonists do,  in his own sane and harassed way.  If you think about Ivan-you-idiot's role in previous Vorkosigan sagas, he has earned his place in the sun, literally in this book, and he performs deeds in aid of his Emperor just as useful to Gregor as the more flamboyant  Miles, or his towering father Aral, or his amazing mother Cordelia.  I will admit one of these deeds was accidental, the result of a fine engineering joke, of which Bujold is fond.  But some of Miles's finest hours stemmed from his worst screw-ups, so Ivan is in good company.<br /><br />Ivan has been a bit of a sleeper as a character in the series, a foil for Miles's quick strategic brain and his compulsive forward momentum. Ivan has been the loyal retainer, a man whose life has been shaped by his mother's superior energy, taste, intelligence, and desire for a grandchild as well as the absence of a father suited to Ivan's needs.  Aral understood Miles's compulsions, because he had passed them directly to him. But Ivan's father is a heroic ghost. Nevertheless,  Ivan loves his mother, and avoids her assiduously in favor of making life as manageable as possible.  He has no taste for heroics, having been burned, or soaked, by his cousin's heroics too often.<br /><br />But love finally forces Ivan from hiding when he meets a woman with  family problems of the same magnitude as his, and who admires him for himself.  In uneasy alliance with By Vorruyter and Simon Illyan, Ivan delicately balances loyalty, diplomacy, deep misgivings, and desire for his new almost-wife, Tej.  And he emerges from his ordeal with the girl, a treasure for Barrayar, and  the solution to a diplomatic problem, all without any help from Miles.<br /><br /> This novel demonstrates, like A Civil Campaign, that if we are sometimes our own worst enemies,  that doesn't mean victory is impossible, just that it will be the sweeter when we finally win.mpossible, just that it will be the sweeter when we finally win.

B0017SWPXY|5.0|I don't own a dog. I am a total cat person. I like reading, but have never really gotten into a dog book or any sort of anything like it. I stumbled upon this book via GoodReads which had offered it for $1.99. It had such good reviews I decided to buy it and give it a shot, not really expecting much.<br /><br />It was such a good book! It's the story of Enzo, an old dog and his owner, Denny. Denny is a race car driver and Enzo is a dog that knows more about the subject than most humans. In between there is a story of love, struggle and I guess, the philosophy of a dogs life. I really enjoyed how the book was written from the eyes of Enzo. It was done well and the book was a complete joy to read. Even when I would turn to it without much enthusiasm, I would end up getting dragged into reading for longer than I had anticipated.<br /><br />I can't tell you how badly I needed this book. I was at a loss after reading The Book Thief and this completely quenched my need for another good book.

As much as I waited for this cookbook, I returned it. I just didn't feel the value was there. For me, if someone has a food blog, I am most likely not going to buy the cookbook.

B005S9ELY4|4.0|Gangster Squad is Zombieland director Ruben Fleischer's first full drama film and only his third feature, but it's his best yet and ends up being one of the best gangster movies since L.A. Confidential, it's thematic cousin. The film will go down with a lingering footnote in relation to the theater shooting in Aurora, CO last July. A crucial scene involving gangsters shooting a theater audience was removed and the context was rewritten and reshot out of respect to the horrific real life events. The film was also delayed from its original September release to this Friday. Despite the unexpected changes, the film works wonderfully.<br /><br />The film, based on true events, begins in 1948 Los Angeles as gangster Mickey Cohen (Sean Penn) is establishing his foothold on the city and ultimately the West Coast. In the opening scene it's quite clear that Cohen will hold nothing back and that he's as ruthless as he is evil. In the next scene, we're introduced to the heroic Sgt. John O'Mara (Josh Brolin) as he single-handedly beats the hell out of some of Cohen's lower level crooks. In an expertly-written (screenplay by Will Beall) introduction, we meet Sgt. Jerry Wooters (scene-stealing Ryan Gosling). Gosling absolutely steals the show in his portrayal of Wooters, which will come as no surprise to his fans of his recent roles (Drive). After struggles to stop Cohen, L.A.P.D. Chief Parker (Nick Nolte) instructs O'Mara to form a small squad to break Cohen's operation apart.<br /><br />The squad is a delight to watch in action, including the minor stumbles along the way. Fleischer has a keen eye for dramatic action and even manages to bring humorous, lighthearted moments from Beall's script to life. The gangster squad is given plenty of time to develop the camaraderie and it's clear they function at their best as a crew. Grace Faraday (Emma Stone) is a fresh take on the femme fatale and Stone is great in the role. It's truly an ensemble film and the cast all deliver fantastic performances.<br /><br />It's a shorter film for its type (just shy of two hours), but it has a balanced flow. Fleischer inserts his Zombieland-esque slow-motion moments, but they're used less for cool sequences and more to reinforce the view from the characters involved who are firing their guns rapid-fire, with time moving in apparent slow motion. It's also a visually beautiful film and feels entirely authentic in its time period. It's absolutely the late 40′s and the time period of L.A. matches up perfectly with other dramas of the same time. Overall, it's a fun and exciting ride that really shines from the wonderful cast performances and turned out as a pleasant surprise.<br /><br />Verdict: Absolutely see in theaterserformances.<br /><br />It's a shorter film for its type (just shy of two hours), but it has a balanced flow.

B005LAII80|5.0|This film really was a surprise. Extremely entertaining and action packed. Highly recommended for anyone looking for a fun watch. Two thumbs up!
0765325950|5.0|Updated Review: No spoilers.  This was a fantastic end to the series.  Not perfect, as I felt the battle scenes were drawn out too much, and the last fifty pages should have been longer.  However, Sanderson delivered just about the best book he could considering the restraints placed upon him by Jordan's notes and ending with Jordan's epilogue.  Overall, this was a fast and furious book, with little room to breathe.  Usually this would be a criticism, but considering that this is the last book of a fourteen book series, do we really need further subtlety and character development at this point?  The sole exception to this is Androl, a character of Sanderson's creation (meant to represent the many things that Jordan needed someone unnamed to accomplish), who I thought Sanderson did a great job of bringing to life.<br /><br />I still need more time to digest the book, as it will take me some time to finally realize that the series I have lived with for twenty years is finished.  This will leave a strange void in my mind.<br /><br />Original Review/Ranting: Now, about the eBook.  I am also an eBook reader for 2-3 years now, and I absolutely HATED having to pick up a physical copy.  But I personally would not give a 1 star review to something just to prove a point.<br /><br />However, I fully understand the complaints about not having it in eBook.  Here are some things for people complaining about the \\"whiners\\" to think about:<br /><br />- Most of us truly prefer the eBooks for various reasons - physical books are a horrible waste of paper, they are heavy, they take up room, they do not have their own light source, etc.  For me, I have three young children, and it is so much easier to help them go to sleep at night when using a self-lighted product that I can hold and turn \\"pages\\" with one hand.<br />- Many (maybe the majority) of eBook \\"whiners\\" were planning to buy both a hardcover and an eBook.  The hardcover would have completed the collection on the shelf that we started many years ago, and the eBook for actually reading.  While I now think books are a waste of space and resources, I (and many others) would have made an exception for this beloved series.  So, for me, I just bought the hardcover and am forced to read that, and now Tor gets one purchase from me instead of two.<br />- Many say that we could just wait for the eBook.  Really?  Just think about it.  How would you feel if the eBook was just released and you had to wait months for the physical copy?  I think we all know the honest answer to that.<br />- eBooks now outsell physical books, at least on Amazon.  So acting like we are a niche group is flat out ignorant.<br /><br />I think that is enough ranting, but I think non-eBook owners need to think about why so many eBook owners are upset.  Maybe we are not just a bunch of selfish ingrates, and actually have a reason for being upset.<br /><br />One last thing - while I do not agree with posting the 1 star reviews, as I use Amazon reviews as a barometer for customer sentiment for products, if it makes any kind of point that this will not be tolerated, then so be it.
B0001I561E|5.0|Great Christmas surprise!  The only gift my niece wanted for Christmas.  Her and her sisters had to watch it immediately.
B001E45XT4|4.0|This was my first gaming headset. It lasted for 2 years before the audio connection when bad, I blame my Asus Transformer table for that. The Female audio jack SUCK on the table.<br />Anyway the product is well build except the audio connection and mic connection. You will have to be careful when handling it. The sound is VERY loud. Sometime I use it as an external speaker because the output was much loader than my phone. I got alot of attention when i wore thses. I plan to replace the audio with a better one. Hopefully that works out.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Sound<br />Build quality<br />The fact that the mic can hide<br />Comfortable<br />Card lenght<br />It will cover your ear if you have a big head like mine. :)<br /><br />Cons:<br />audio connection and mic connection they are fragile!!!!<br />The cups are a lint magnet. Will require cleaning about once a month.<br /><br />To me it would have been cool if the red parts glowed or light up.<br />BTW I paid $30 for this at Brandmartusa in the Sawgrass Mall. I wouldn't pay $80 for this old product, sorry!! Its an investment well spent though.<br />I gave it 4 Stars because of the audio connection and mic connection and it dont glove :P.

B0072OFM28|5.0|With the passing of Andy Whitfield (Excellent as Spartacus 1st season - Blood and Sand), I thought I would be disappointed with his replacement, Liam McIntyre.  He certainly had a challenge before him.  However, with each episode of Vengence he has demonstrated his acting skills and is so believable in the role.  Great Story, Superb Acting, an Epic Adventure.  Very Adult Orientated!

1455527475|3.0|A great insight into the world of investment banking. Greg goes out to explain how he went from an intern to a management director in 12 years, what his compensation was and how it all happened. Definately worthwhile for those interested in a career in Finance.

B003D87PPY|5.0|After reading the extensive excerpt offered in 'Look Inside' I decided it was a book I've been longing for. Not disappointed so far, though there are many pages ahead.
B000HWZ5X8|5.0|Manic Nirvana is Bob's best album to date, in my opinion. One can't go wrong with the hard rocking that this album brings. What's even better is the fact that this album has variety and diversity across the musical spectrum. This album has hard rock, 50s nostalgia, synth-driven songs with mean guitar solos, and acoustic sounds. What you get is an album for many moods, and the usual gritty vocals by the most recognized voice in the business. This album isn't perfect (as it contains a few bland songs) but has songs such as TIE DYE ON THE HIGHWAY, HURTING KIND, ANNIVERSARY, and LIAR'S DANCE (a 90s version of BLACK MOUNTAIN SIDE) that are stellar and really carry this album. I prefer this album over the previous album, Now and Zen; that album was good, but too many keyboards and softness to it made it reflective and indicative of its time. Plant really packs a punch in this one; don't miss out on this great energetic recording.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|its a great tool and my daughter loves it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Highly recommend this for kids of all ages and adults as well.....
B00899F0G8|5.0|It has the action and suspense I love! Keeps me on the edge of my seat wondering what is going to happen next!!
B009X01D9U|4.0|This came just before my new kindle fire HD and it has been a great case. I love the idea of the revolving style to change from landscape to portrait when needed. It works great and I have had no problems...love the orange color as well.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|is a good game! :D fun to play. I play it everytime I'm on my kindle. teaches a good lesson
B000002KAT|5.0|I bought Astral Weeks over 20 years ago because I dug the Waterboys' version of \\"Sweet Thing\\" so very much. Of course, I had assumed it was their song, as I wasn't really familiar with Morrison (beyond \\"Brown Eyed Girl\\"), but when I saw in the liner notes who had penned the song, I went out and got the album.<br /><br />And immediately thought wth??<br /><br />I was accustomed to slick, clean rock, like the Waterboys. This just seemed like a garbled, warbled mess. I didn't know what to make of it. But I hate wasting money on an album, so I gave it another listen. Then another. And, well, let me give it one more try.<br /><br />48,198 listens later...<br /><br />IMO, this is the most amazing album ever made by anyone. There is an emotional depth, and intensity, that I've just not heard anywhere else. The lyrics are powerful and moving. Morrison's delivery leaves me thunderstruck. His humming. His yearning. His strumming. This album comes from a very deep place that exists in us all, but that few have the courage or ability to tap.<br /><br />My word for this album? Gratitude. I am immensely grateful to Van Morrison for having made this album. It is a work you have to meet. You have to open yourself up and meet Van Morrison where he is. If you do this, your life will be immeasurably enriched.
B001CEE1YE|5.0|cant go wrong here no complaints from me the item worked as described and arrived on time and when they said it would. .
B000FBFN1U|5.0|The best book of the series yet. I couldn't put this book down. GRRM is totally unpredictable, you don't know from one minute to the next what is going to happen. I can't wait to start the next book.
B003ZK58WM|5.0|Kept me reading... great book would recommend to anyone. Cannot wait for next book. Will keep my eyes open for other books like it
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|I like the way this dictionary is set up.  Not only, do they give you several definitions, but the pronunciation is written and has voice pronunciation.  What a great addition!  It is very handy to use it online rather than carry a big dictionary around wherever I go.  I can just look at my phone, iPad, or computer.  I even have it on my Kindle Fire.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|Love this game on my laptop or computer. Not so much on my Kindle. Not as easy to navigate between playing gifting and collecting. If you play you know what I mean. This app needs a upgrade but, still will use it.

B0094BB4TW|4.0|Sometimes this app takes me back to things I have looked up in the past... and haven't looked at in days. I am not sure why it picks that point to go back to... Also, this app freezes sometimes and will not load pictures.
B00AQ3K8IU|2.0|This book is painful to read. Although Hoover has interesting ideas, she fails to translate them into anything readable. Instead, she writes a mawkish and predictable story about teen love and angst. Sky, Holder, Breckin, and Six are as annoying and unlikable as their names. As many other reviewers have suggested, this book needs a warning about the sensitive material it contains. Regardless, I believe that Hoover doesn't have the skill to write about such a topic without offending her audience.<br /><br />I am confused as to why this book has such a high rating. I can not see anybody over the age of 12 enjoying this book, so do yourself a favor and save your money.
B001ANSS5K|5.0|it's great To know that My future Expeditions to these said paper Towns are obtainable. They will all be in the Name of adventurous Margo roth spiegelman.<br /><br />Also in the Name of roadtrips.

B001B3MCQK|5.0|Heard about this guy on 60 Minutes. If you like Bob Dylan, you'll love Rodriquez. And, since he spent most of his life in obscurity, it's great to support him so he's comfortable and able to practice his craft later in life.

B00AKEMHCA|5.0|This game is a lot of fun and is very addicting. I originally played it on PC and find' t l it cause it seemed like a lamer version of BTD4, but that changed over time. It' s even better on here than PC. GET IT!!!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Great book.......I hate when an author leaves me hanging this much. It could have ended a little better. I guess this has to be done so the reader can buy the next book for sure !
B0036UMM84|5.0|I purchased this movie before Christmas, received it promptly and watched it with my daughter the following week. She loved it and had remembered it from her childhood so I gave it to her and ordered myself a new one...I love ordering through Amazon.com.  I take advantage of &#34;free shipping&#34; whenever I can and love the convenience of ordering online.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|Although this was not the kind of book I normally read,  I found it kept my interest.  I would not let my  under age children read this.
0374533571|1.0|I'm about 3/4 of the way through this book and it's taking everything I have to finish it.  It reads like Pat (the main character) is a 5 year old which leaves me completely disconnected with him.  There is no storyline and it drags on and on.  I skipped paragraphs and paragraphs about Eagles play action that I thought was beyond boring.  Every night I begin to read I think, tonight I will read something that will make this book worth it and then I'm disappointed again.  After hearing the great reviews about the movie I thought I would read the book first to hold true to the \\"book is always better\\" and I wish I would have just skipped the book all together.  The only reason I will even finish this book is to find out what \\"apart time\\" really means.  I mean really, a 34 year old man calls a separation from his wife \\"apart time\\" and the institution he was in \\"the bad place\\".  UGH!!!
B000056NX5|1.0|I was so disappointed. I bought this not realizing it was not the early version, even putting on for guests at Easter time only to turn it off in a few minutes! the music may have been there but the setting and characters was just wrong. I put one star only because there was no option for NO STARS>
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Awesome, I loved it. The movie did not do justice to this book. I would recommend this to any friend
B002VHI8FE|5.0|Amazing read that kept me entertained every page! Each chapter brings new adventure and trepidation while progressing further along in the plot.
B008ALA6DW|5.0|Just plug it in and it works, no configuration, no updates, no tech support. It just works! Would purchase from this vendor again.

B00APUYWYA|5.0|It was very funny and intertaining. Kept me interested through out the movie. Love the accessability and the security to view a movie on Prime.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I use it instead of my phone, the large numbers and speedy reaction time is much better.  I use it for school work and budgeting. I find it very handy.
B000FBFN1U|4.0|I love this entire series. For the most part, the story is paced quite well, and Martin paints a beautiful picture of the world in which the conflict takes place. My only complaint is that he sometimes uses too much detail. Frankly, I don't need two [long] paragraphs about what foods were prepared for the wedding feast, or a detailed history of each family called to war by the bannermen. I wish he'd let the story flow without getting bogged down by descriptions that are best left to set designers. That said, DO NOT PASS UP THE 'GOT' SERIES!!
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I expected this book to be great science fiction and it certainly was. What I did not expect was the humor! The author created a resourceful yet sarcastically witty main character that stole my heart. I look forward to many more books by this author.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|I am a huge fan of Sister Act, and this felt like the modern day version - minus the nuns!
0525478817|5.0|This was one of the best novels I have ever read. It makes you laugh, cry, and ponder about the things being said in the book. John Green really makes you think about your own life, and how you perceive it. The book itself is just an amazing read. No boring parts, and exciting all the way through. Don't turn it down because it's about cancer, trust me you won't regret it. The book leaves you feeling satisfied, and not sad at all. Definitely recommend this book to everyone!!!
0316017930|4.0|The theory of the book lines up well with what I see happening in multiple organizations.  Want to learn more.
B007QUUJMG|4.0|This book was had compelling language that made you want to flip through the book and start all over again
0765325950|5.0|Isn't a review, more like a counter to all the people bringing this books rating down because of the lack of ebook. Big freaking deal! You're not helping yourself, you are only hurting Brandon and Team Jordan by bringing this books rating down. Shame on you, you lazy fools. Go buy the book or wait it out. 1 starring this book does nothing for you.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I read this book in 8 days! This book kept me wanting more! Can't wait to read the next one!!!!
B00008J2PG|5.0|This movie was a hit in the past and is still a hit today.  Gregory Peck is superb in his performance in this movie.  It is intense at times and yet has some parts that will make you laugh out right.  A must see at any time.
B000C13Y2S|3.0|4 stars b/c 3x batteries of a hard to find type LR41 (atleast 3 starters included/installed, they do have a good life in LEDs too)<br /><br />3 stars b/c product NOT AS PICTURED, legs on arrived product were cheap plastic (thin) lever stands, not metal cylinder stands with ends as shown by vendor(s) and body/yellow lines not present, even tho 95-113 on package label<br /><br />+1/2 star for light being quite bright!  It's not labelled, but possibly 30 to 60 lumens for a little guy

B004GUSG4M|4.0|This book had me from the first page.  Very interesting story.  Couldn't put it down in the end.  So glad I read it.
B0085TKAW6|4.0|Very good novel based on historical events showing the evil side of events that occurred in Europe during the second world war.

B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I play this game not only on here but on my IPhone too. I love it and when I'm out and about it gives me something to do to pass the time away.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Loved it, on to the next one. Not sure what  going to do after though, should I watch the movie?
096798467X|5.0|I bought the first edition several years ago when I started baking bread. It took a few years to finally decide that while my kitchen oven was fine for bread (with dutch ovens/cloches), it just doesn't work for great pizza or BBQ (no smoke). So I bought the third edition and started work. The new edition has new information that makes it well worth buying (even if you have a previous edition). Denzer is an excellent writer. I think he brings out the scientist and artist among his readers: his book is not so much a recipe for building an oven as a discussion of the experiments you can do to understand clay, fire, and bread. The first layer of my oven is drying now and I'm planning my insulation and plaster layers. The process is lots of fun and Denzer encourages his readers to try out their own ideas and play around.

B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I thought it was a great book although, Greg should have been more successful in the end. All in all, it was a great book.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Really enjoyed the whole series, author kept me interested until the very end...i was just sad to reach the end of the series!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book had me hooked from the start until the end. I appreciate everything a little more in my life after finishing this book. It opened my eyes to how fortunate I truly am for my average life because this book shows you exactly how some people have it a lot worse than you do. Highly recommended!
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Started using this game right out of the box and it worked great. Some of the characters on the tiles were really too small to read, but it didn't hinder the play.

B00001U0E1|5.0|There is so much to say about this lovely movie.  The beauty and truth with which the colors of old England were used, the cleverness of the Swans on the stage curtains with which to depict Gwinneth Paltrow's long neck, etc down to the very last detail.  From the beginning scene to the last, if you are a fan of anything Shakespeare, you will not be disappointed and, you will be a lifetime fan of this absolutely lovely, funny, and romantic movie.  Joseph Fiennes was a wonderful Shakespeare and the passion between he and Ms Paltrow are more than believable.  The chemistry was wonderful onscreen and only added to the light-hearted and thrilling and refreshing re-enactment of &#34;Romeo and Juliet&#34; - all Romantics must own this classic old English and wonderful video for all time.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|First: I mean NO judgement of Dr. Alexander's NDE, in fact, I accept it! My reaction is to the literary style of the book. Having looked in the \\"face\\" [used metaphorically, given Dr. Alexander's description] of the almighty - I would have expected an account with much more awe and much less attention to the earthly medical detail and interpersonal and occasionally logistical minutia. But such, I suppose, is the style of the medical doctor - scientist who experienced it and author who must anticipate its skeptical reception without \\"detail\\".<br /><br />The back-and-forth chapters between the beyond and the here-and-now became tedious and seemed needless especially in terms of the details of the bedside coma watch, obviously collected after his recovery. Still, the literary objective of the events interleaving is apparent, if strained: to connect the living and the afterlife and to reinforce the fact of death [no matter how that now confusing term is defined].<br /><br />I enjoyed the book, am left marveling at the experience described, and wholly recommend this book to others. Nonetheless, this wasn't the account one would expect of an experience of this magnitude and awe. My three-stars (and maybe it should have been four) are for the perceived quality of the read, not skepticism of the event.
B00005JMFQ|5.0|Love, Actually is a once in a great while movie that comes along and totally steals your heart.  Since viewing this movie in 2004, I immediately bought it and put it to the top of my Christmas movie stack.  Every Christmas since '04 this is played on DVD.  The English have a way with comedy and satire that cannot be surpassed and this movie will not disappoint you in any way.  The cleverness in which the  individual stories are tied together in the end was just a thrill to watch.  Each actor and story was just, in a nutshell, Well Done All.  Yes to this and 5 stars for certain.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|It's a real feel-good movie! It's a fresh look at a college movie. Great date night rental. You'll be singing & dancing along soon enough.
B000Q6GUT8|5.0|I have followed Mark Whalberg's career since his appearance in &#34;The Perfect Storm&#34; and, in my opinion, he stole that movie 100%.  As the &#34;Shooter&#34; Mark doesn't disappoint.  This movie is a non-stop thrill ride from beginning to end.  As a rule, I steer clear of violent movies, however this is one of those movies that comes along from time to time such as &#34;The Shawshank Redemption&#34; and you can't turn your head from the screen.  Aside from Mr Whalberg's obvious sexual charisma on screen, his acting is remarkable and, if you didn't know otherwise, would think that this was his chosen profession.  Everyone else did a great job of acting also, particularly the young lady who played his love interest.  For certain this is a &#34;thumbs totally UP&#34; movie and a must see for all who enjoy an adventure ride from start to finish.
B0074VTHKM|5.0|This is a great read  for teens looking for mystery and suspense!  I highly recommend this book!<br />It's truly  great read!

B006M9NJFG|5.0|The Gerber Bear Grylls canteen with cooking cup combo is a solid product that is more durable and can hold more liquid than its military counterpart.  The canteens construction is very solid and tough i dropped it by accident from a two story window on to concrete side walk and it survived with barely a scratch. The sturdy carrying pouch that dries quickly when wet is a welcome addition to this set. The large cooking cup serves well as both a drinking cup and cooking food container that can feed even the hungriest of appetites. All in all a good product that i plan to get a second or even third of in the future. Thanks for reading.

B0033H7VI6|5.0|The Schrade SCHF9 Extreme Survival Knife is an incredible knife at an incredible price. Most knives I've brought online fall into the category of dainty and fragile look at them wrong and the blade falls off the handle. But the SCHF9 extreme survival knife is the exception and what an exception to the rule. First off the blade is full tang carbon steel 1/4&#34; thick 12&#34; long serious composite contoured handles with a getter done no excuses attitude to match. Cut wood please, chop veggies more please, wheres the beef running and hiding if it knows whats good for it. Comes with an great carrying case that any out doors-men could turn into an emergency survival kit. As far as I'm concerned this knife beats many higher priced competitors on the market on durability and versatility alone. Sure other knives may be better suited for some tasks than this one but you would be hard pressed to find more versatility and durability in other knives that come standard with this badass.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Saw it in the Theater and decided to buy the best package I could when this came out.<br /><br />Needless to say, I bought this so I can have the extra goodies - while being able to play strictly on my computers DVD player or even Blu-Ray player as I wish between the two without having to buy the movie twice.<br /><br />I got this DVD set on sale, then got it a little cheaper than that - still cheaper than buying two!<br /><br />This movie sticks to all that you know and love about The Avengers, and the characters from each movie that you've gotten to know personality wise.<br /><br />This will be my shorter review and there's not much to say without spoiling anything!

B003TSEEDY|5.0|The Perks of Being A Wallflower<br />By Stephen Chbosky<br />Charlie is 15 and beginning his life in high school, so he decides to write an anonymous friend letters instead of keeping a diary because someone could always find a diary. Charlie is shy and keeps to himself but it doesn't take long for him to find his own group of friends. They are typical teenagers going to school, football games, and parties. They find their way to all sorts of alcohol and trendy drugs.<br /><br />Charlie, Sam and Patrick are best friends and Charlie finds himself just a little bit in love with Sam, even if she told him that he was too young for her. He doesn't care he can't just help to love her. Charlie likes high school ok but the thing he likes the most is his English teacher, who said they were friends and Charlie could call him Bill. Every week Bill gives him a new book to read and write a report for that book. The books are as interesting as everything and Charlie learns so much from his books.<br /><br />The year passes quickly and all the trials of being a teenager weigh Charlie down, his older friends are getting ready to leave and Charlie just isn't sure he can face each day without them. His whole world starts to fall apart and Charlie has to go away to pick up the pieces.<br /><br />Review:<br /><br />This is one of the best books I have ever read. The whole book takes place in 1991 and 1992 which I love because I was 14 in 1991, and Charlie and his friends could have been anyone that I knew. I think as adults we forget that as teenager we are living with all sorts of adult problems just try to cope and go day by day. I really love how the author caught the real essence of that in the creation of all the characters. I would quickly put this on a list of book that everybody should read by the time they are in their 20's.<br /><br />I really got myself wrapped in the characters and really related with Charlie's grasp of not knowing what was happening to him when his mentalillness took over. It is so frightening for a young adult to have such deep rooted problems and have no idea where it comes from, what it is and how to stop it. To say I love this book is putting it lightly, I hope anybody who gets the chance to read this will read and come away with the same uplifting experience as I did.
B009DH37CY|5.0|I have read about this being the final concert to feature Freddie Mercury before his passing. It has been great hearing him singing those songs we all know very well and even seeing it. I totally recommend this to all.
B005LAII12|4.0|Great movie, glad I bought it. Also, a really good price.  While definitely not for everyone, it is hilarious and has a good story as a foundation.
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|Good game overall. Just hard to find neighbors who also play it through the Kindle Fire and Facebook. I like it.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I love the Downton Abbey series and would recommend this to anyone who would like to have the series to watch over and over.
B001RPD06I|5.0|When I got my new Galaxy s3 a couple of weeks ago, i just transfered my old SD card from my inspire to the Galaxy. But a couple of days into it I started realizing i am needing more space to store photos, etc. This is a great SDHC card for the money. I haven't had a problem with it and it came on time.
B003Y5H5AQ|3.0|I didn't know that this could not be played on a DVD player. There was no information about that part at all. People need to know these things before purchasing.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Fast paced journey that delves into Agent Pedergasts past and future. A seemingly unrelated side plot leaves open questions for the next novel.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Beautiful Disaster is one of the most addicting books I've read recently. I spent 8 hours and more 4 hours today to finish this book, I just could not put it down.<br />I love romances and I can't stop reading until I know what's next and when it is done, I always feel like I want some more. I totally am reading Walkind Disaster and seriously, I am glad it is not out it otherwise I would just spend one more night awake.
1419705849|2.0|After reading the first six books my seven year old son and I were excited for this one. What a disappointment. We hardly laughed like we did with the others. Seemed like the author was just trying to fulfill his contract not entertain readers.
B007W8S2MG|5.0|I've never played Persona before. I heard about it. I'm a fan of japanese rpgs like Final fantasy. I wanted a AAA game for my vita. A game that is long, fun and able to delvier shot burst of great gaming while on the go. Even though the story is long, it is well done. It draws you in. The characters  are full of...erm... character. makes it fell like if you are playing an anime. which you are. The music is OMG-level. I think its one of the best soundtracks i've listened to in a long time. I just love this game so much and i finally feel satisfied with the purchase of my vita.
B000WS4P1K|5.0|Every song on this CD I feel is the best of what he has done to this day. Great buy!
B009HEJXFS|5.0|very funny. Filled with witty sarcasms. Interactions between characters was great. The way the future was tied to the past was interesting and revealing to character development. Very enjoyable.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Very well written and a must read, especially for those who have lost a loved one.  I have always believed in the after life and became obsessed in researching this topic after loosing the love of my life to cancer in 2008.  It is comforting to know that there is such a beautiful place that we go to after our time here on this dimension.
B00006ADFL|5.0|This is a superb film based on the weird story, from 1960's New Zealand, of the obsessional love affair between two teenage schoolgirls, which led to their conspiracy in the murder of the mother of the mother of one of them, and the aftermath of that.
B005IQZB14|5.0|Strayed takes us Along on a hike to find not only the answers to her soul searching but an adventure of a lifetime. Excellent!
B00A9X9TIW|3.0|In this day and age of CGI effects to the maximum, I thought.  Joe G Levit just didn't cut it as a younger Bruce. The plot was unique, but the characters lacked depth. Also, when did killing children ever be acceptable, whatever the reason?
B0041KKYBA|5.0|product received as was ofered. no problems with it and satisfaded with the order. also came on time as expected.
B000VDDDVO|5.0|I have always loved this Christmas movie and watch it every year. I bought it for my own Christmas Movie collection.
B00129H7VS|5.0|I guess its that my Dad was severely wounded in the Battle of Budge that has made me so interested in this series. I have watched it about 20 times so far, both the regular and blu-ray version. The main reason I bought the blu-ray is because it offers interactive comments by the surviving soldiers. I have spent the last 6 months reading all of the books by all of the Easy Company soldiers that had books. After reading so many.....I am still looking for more and have found a few besides the best sellers, you start to develop a real connection with the characters. I am reading the book by David Webster who was the feature of the story about the river raid to capture a German. I would recommend if you really are into this and WWII history, you will love this mini series and love the Blu-ray version. Well worth the money!
B0042U94UQ|5.0|Bought as a gift. We watched it at Christmas. It is an excellent movie, for children and adults! Evil  villain turns into a nice guy.
B000FA5SMK|5.0|Well written, funny murder mystery. Demille is a great story teller. I can't wait to read another of his novels.
145210655X|5.0|So much fun to read.  It made me laugh out loud to see the DV so mundane and parental.  Now I can truly relate....
B00006LWSF|4.0|A well rounded cd with em killin em wit lose ya self! that joint & fiddys wanksta is enough to get it! I got a good deal ,so im pretty much sarisfied!
0345477618|5.0|Love this book.  Very good content and focuses well on the topic at hand.  Would be nice in hardcover as the book is very heavy! Which makes it a better coffee table book than a bathroom book.
B0096CDG0O|5.0|I love yahtzee, and this is it! I also LOVE that fact that you can play others live. If you like yahtzee, you will love this!
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Just lovely; I think there is only 1 song I'm not crazy about.  I would have to say it is the perfect mood music!
B0091REZMW|4.0|its fine n idk wat else to say sooo byeee!!!!! uggggg it wont let me go cos of da stupid 20 minimum word rule
B0001O3YD0|5.0|Pitch Black is one interesting movie from beginning to end! The scarey darkness couldn't be scarier and the twist and turns holds you in wonder!
B002N5N5R0|5.0|Given as a gift to a die hard fan of the series...it was played almost immediately and has been watched endlessly. Also purchased additional seasons, with the same result. YAY!
B000J10EQU|5.0|Superman returns is a wonderful movie with heart moving scenes and a great cast of actors! It's a shame they didn't follow up with more movies with this super cast!
B007HACDLK|5.0|Vince Flynn has done it again with his exciting character, Mitch Rapp.  Well Done!  Great read kept me on the edge of my seat.
0778328821|5.0|Another winner from Debbie Macomber.  Especially like the story of the shop and it's contents.  Will continue reading her books and enjoying her characters.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|This story reminds me a lot about a relationship that I have had in the past. It is fun to think about how one would really act if this was actually proposed. Very nice to be in a fantasy world for awhile.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|Enjoyed every minute of listening to this book. Wonderful and tragic story. I am amazed that I lived in these time and had no idea of what was happening in the south.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|This is a fun way to play Mahjong, but you can never really loose or win the game because of the reset button................you always win.
B0086700CM|4.0|I was super excited when this app came out cause I had been waiting for it but its laggy sometimes and it agrivates me cause I waited so long for it lol
B006LSZECO|1.0|Sure, this book started out as an amazimg read but the endimg was the worst I've ever read! i can't believe an author would even think that ending was even vaugly satisfactory, much less that a publisher thought this waste of resources was justifiable! DO NOT buy this book! Absolute worst book I've ever bought!
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|Midnight in Paris  - I really love this movie. It makes me wish that I had lived in Paris in the 20's.
B004QK5N5W|5.0|I have one of these at each HDTV so that I don't have to hunt for one when I need it.
B0071MQ37E|5.0|It was amazing, well worth the buy. Definatly a watch if you've never seen it, I urge anyone and everyone to watch it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I was hesitant to read this series... but now I am hooked!  This story is told in a vibrant manner. I myself am picturing the many landscapes and characters in this story in a very \\"real\\" manner! Can't wait to start book 2!
B00AMBLXP8|2.0|Jokes were lazy and same old Seth Macfarland comedy.  I like Seth Macfarland's stuff, but this movie was just comprised of jokes that could've been on one of the animation shows.  Movie .concept was good but plot wasn't.  In all, not to much to speak of.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The season has started off with a bang! I love Shirley McClain as Cora's mom! Wonderful start to the show after having to wait forever for the premier!
B005V2EVBQ|4.0|My Kindle Fire is now protected in such a lightweight case, before buying this product i was not sure how it would be fitting but as soon as I put the Kindle in it i fell in love with it...Thanks Marware you guys rock!!!
B005DOL0R0|5.0|I am very happy with my purchase of the Kindle sleeve. I can just toss my Kindle in my purse and not worry about it getting scratched.
B00003CXCD|5.0|I choose this rating of five stars because i absolutely love this classical film, the first thing when i open the package i watch it right away. I love it
B007SO31BQ|4.0|This was given for a gift, the receiver is a fan of Senna he enjoyed this video and is a historical record for him.
B000MX7V5M|5.0|another great classic film to watch, i enjoy it very dearly. and such a great price. i'll advise everyone to watch it
B005LAIGZU|5.0|This movie was amazing, moving, and just overall a great war movie. If you like war, action so on this is the movie for you.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I'm really glad I didn't pay for this book and borrowed it from a friend. I read the mostly bad reviews and thought, well it can be that bad right?? Oh, it is. This is coming from someone who actually enjoyed reading the Twilight series. Like other reviews mention, the writing is horrible. It's the same thing on every page. Christian is so hot, we get it!! I read half and can't get myself to finish the rest and I've never not finished a book. Seriously, this book is trash and I can't figure out how it's a best seller.
B002WY65W4|5.0|It's a hilarious movie. I've seen it many times. Somewhat ironic about the fact there will never be another Twinkie made, and the world isn't even full of zombies yet. If you like comedies and zombies, this is a perfect match. Plus the cameos and twists are just icing on an already sweet sweet cake.
B00A0SKFLG|3.0|I have not read the book, but am told that this version is closer to the book that the Schwarzenegger version, which I loved.  This had great potential, with the excellent effects and technology, but somehow it fell short.  I think it was because its elements were either not as good as the original or not developed enough to engage the viewer.  It was almost as if parts of the story were skimmed over, cut or condensed.  It was good enough for a rental, but I'm glad I didn't buy it.
B00APUQPX6|4.0|This movie is great fun for every age group, I enjoyed the story line as did everyone watching it spoke to all of us and made for an outstanding family night at the movies. I cannot wait to see what they do next
B000002H6C|5.0|i lost this cd a few years back and had to get it again. love it. this is my favorite record by metallica.
B00A50PDDY|5.0|Though slightly redundant concerning their earlier works, this album makes use of some of the group's more popular songs, as well as six new releases. As far as I am concerned, Twenty-One Pilots has all of the variety required in a band of their size, with copious amounts left over. With subtle melodies in songs such as \\"House of Gold,\\" and more in-your-face radio pop, like their hit single \\"Migraine,\\" the band is a definite pleasure to listen to. Having followed their works since the release of their second album, \\"Regional at Best,\\" I can say that this album is promising with new blends of guitar and their classic rap and melodic piano. Five stars all the way.
B00190OHD6|5.0|This is one of those movies where you think it's your standard chick flick but within the first 20 minutes it becomes an intense swept film.<br /><br />The acting is great, Lisa Kudrow plays her usual character, but this is one of her better times soon so.<br /><br />Hilary Swank was convincing and Butler was perfection.<br /><br />Not just a chick flick good for all.
B003JSSPSY|5.0|While the series could have went on longer if they had the ratings or whatever they had to shut the series down for. The end of the season was amazing and well wrapped up. I couldn't believe my eyes at the wonderful ending. The reviews I seen had me worried that the ending would leave me hanging, but this didn't at all. If they had continued with the series it could have though.
B00A7CI82I|5.0|good movie, hope another one comes out with both stars matt and jeremy renner. would make a great addition to the sreies
B004H1V5RU|5.0|This thing will drive you nuts, I bought 8 of them for Christmas gifts for my friends and they love it/hate me lol.
0765325950|5.0|I log on to amazon to see how much it's gonna be for the last WOT book ever and what do I see? A ton of idiot crybaby whiners that are complaining about an e-book version not being available. SO WHAT I remember when it used to be a year between hardback and paperback versions of a book. I originally started reading this series in paperback but threw those away and went and got the whole series in hardback after the paperbacks fell apart from being read so much. So go and get a life quit whining and either get the hardback or wait till the format you want comes out. I'm sure this will be a great book and I'll be getting it soon but prolly not reading it for at least a month since I plan on starting over from book 1 since it's been so long since I read it last and it's such a detailed series that every time you read it you notice something new!
B0086700CM|4.0|This game is fun if not challenging. It makes me laugh because I'm often falling off the path. It is very interesting also!
B0055IU4GM|4.0|If you like the blues John Hiatt style, you will like this. Really liked Til I Get My Lovin Back and Detroit Made
B00A6N8F4Y|5.0|This movie was really good and worth watching. It was not a waste of time, I recommend it and I can even see it again. I Loved it!
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I love courtroom mysteries, and this is the best one I've read in quite a while. The fifth star is missing for me due to a too &#34;twisty&#34; end. But still, a good read.
B009HEJXFS|4.0|An adequate sequel. Brolin is an inspired choice to play the younger Agent K. Nice little twist is waiting for anyone who hasn't seen this one.
B00A9X9ORI|4.0|Definitely worth watching which is more than I can say about most movies lately. All the primary actors do a great job.
B004DM0UII|5.0|This is my favorite Internet radio app that I have on my kindle! Very easy to navigate, equalizer feature works great, and they have a huge selection of world wide stations! I have had none of the previous issues stated in the other reviews. I would HIGHLY recommend this app for people who are seriously tired of the songza or Pandora loop.
B005LAII80|4.0|There are to many spots in this movie were Karl Urban (Judge Dredd)looks and acts like Sylvester Stallone.<br />He has the same stubble and frown on his face.<br /><br />I have not see or read the comics (graphic novels) so this is going to be a comparison between the movies.<br /><br />Stallones was almost comic like.<br />Urbans was more realistic what the comic books probably were like.<br /><br />Stallones tried to wow us with the future of its movie flying cars.<br />Urbans was futuristic but not in a stupid way.<br /><br />Stallones spent more on showing us how great the future will be.<br />Urbans was more of a dark future but everything was more realistic.<br /><br />I would rate Stallones Judge Dredd a 1 1/2 star.<br />Urbans lost a star because the first time you see Dredd you would think you were watching Stallone.<br /><br />I edited this review because it was pointed out I was combining two movies that Stallone did.<br />Guess that's what happens when you watch to many movies and Stallone does to many of the same movies.
B0058YPL66|5.0|This is our Sunday night girl time at our house. It is nice to be able to watch a show that my 10 year old and teens can agree on.
B0050KTR36|5.0|My anatomy students found this game very helpful for review.  Sometimes where your finger touches is very picky and other times not, but still fun.
B000XUBFE2|3.0|in a book forum, it was a good read, but choppy in places. I'm not sure I'll read another book by this author.
B00AMBK0X4|5.0|I have this movie 5 stars be because I honestly laughed beginning to end. Is a different kind of comedy movie then most out right now. Definitely NOT for children.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I am Hooked! This is a great series! I just happened to stumble upon this when everywhere I looked people were talking about it. I needed to know for myself what this Downton Abbey things was. I was greatly surprised that this show was exactly the type I love.<br />Each episode makes me want more!
B003G94BZC|4.0|I loved the first 4 seasons of Doctor Who but was a bit disappointed with the first half of season 5. Even though I found the first half of the season disappointing I was happy I finished it, and it was pretty enjoyable overall.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|It was the<br /> best book I have ever read in my entire life. IT REALLY HIT THE TOP TEN.  : )
B009JBZH54|5.0|The Dark Knight is the main reason for the rating, Not a fan of Bane in Rises. But DK is such a good movie, one of my favorites.
B0000C9ZBW|5.0|My husband loves these watches.  Just be careful he has already cracked the crystal on a previous watch due to that they are so light weight on your wrist.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|Hence behaves haven't executable scrapbook scrapbook diffusion debugging accounting assign awful guts chunk hd an w effect dessert school school
B004J4WKTW|4.0|Atmosphere, mystery, penetrating writing, a clever premise.  The structure mirrors the layout of the circus itself, intriquing chapters set up like cirucs tents in time with all sorts of curious attractions available within.  But, as with all magic, things may not be as they seem.
B005IQZB14|5.0|Wild was so amazing.  I couldn't put it down!  I could hardly believe someone was so unprepared and so courageous and so lucky at times but the whole story was mesmerizing.
B00770KR7W|5.0|I'm not keen on toys that involve an assault riffle but my grandson wanted it so much that I got it. He's happy but understands my hatred for guns.
B0002E5O9G|5.0|The vocalists are fantastic. Although this is a live performance and the crowd cheers a bit, the interruptions are brief and not very noticable. As an avid fan of Les Miserables, I recomend this highly.
B004LWZW9C|2.0|Upon seeing the cast list for this movie, I was interested to see it. It has a cast of top-notch actors, many famous and well-known... such as; Robert De Niro, Michelle Pfiefer, Halle Berry, John Lithgow, Cary Elwes, Ashton Kutcher, etc.  And, the premise seems a good one - the intertwined stories of various couples and individuals at the culmination of year's end.  The acting is very good.  The cinematography, direction, and editing are all good too.  But, he story itself; the script, the dialog, the evolution of the story... this is where the movie fails.  With a wonderful cast and likeable direction, you would expect it to be at least a moderately good movie. But, the core of the movie - the story (script and dialog) - is weak and lifeless. Aside from an enigmatic performance by De Niro as a dying man who wants to see the Times Square ball drop on new year's eve, the story and dialog is completely lifeless and uninteresting. I really wanted to like this movie, because it had the potential to be a quality comedy-drama... but it fails to satisfy because of bad script writing.
B008K9SG9K|2.0|I like their songs I have heard on the radio, and bought this CD based on that.  While I like the music, the CD is so base overdriven and distorted on some songs I had to check to see if my subwoofers and woofers had gotten somehow blown.  Interestingly, some of the songs are so compressed, that they sound very thin and flat.  Very, very strange.  I gave the CD 2 stars because of the music, but 0 stars for the engineering and production.
1577314808|5.0|I didn't read it for any other reason but sheer logical explanations it has. It is something with pondering over.
1607066017|5.0|As a big fan of Brian K. Vaughn I had to get this. It lived up to my high expectations and the art is amazing.
B005IQ39AY|5.0|I love this game! play it every day! It's my favorite way to relax. I even play it more than i do bejeweled and that was my game!
B008476HBM|5.0|I love Jane Austen's books and Pride and Prejudice was the firts one I read and I fell in love with it. So I wanted to have this one on my Kindle. I've bought my Kindle recently so i wanted to know how it will work. For me, everything is alright and Pride and Prejudice is a classic. I also own this book in hard cover. Plus, it's for free.
B004QITJC2|3.0|The Word of God says all those who follow the beast [satan] will be cast into the lake of fire soon and that the `god of this world' has blinded the minds of those who don't want to believe in a Holy and Just God. Now would you rather spend eternity burning in hell or spend eternity in the glory of Jesus? The choice is yours!\\" He that sows to the flesh will reap destruction\\"!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I'll start off by saying this book was nothing I expected. I usually feel let down by disappointing, cheesy endings, to the series I've read. This book being one of few exceptions.<br /><br />The story seemed to drag a bit longer in the beginning than the other books, but the latter parts definitely make up for that. I did find bits of the story to be very unnecessary, however. I was not as glued to this book as the others. Yet I am very satisfied, overall, on how the author concluded the series. Some parts were extremely emotional, tearjerkers so to say.<br /><br />I am sure this series shall remain among my favorites for a long time.
B000F8O35U|5.0|Got this for my wife and she opened it and watched it same day. This was her favorite movie growing up, so she had some sentimental value to it.
B007704HO6|5.0|I purchased this book because I saw an excert of it on utube and found the short version very interesting.<br />I'm a cat lover myself and have so far read 4 chapters of the book and find it very good - it'd light reading<br />and you can relate to the author so easily as this is his autobiography.<br />Would recommend this book to people of all ages - its sad in some parts and very funny in others.
0670026603|3.0|I made a terrible mistake and bought this book for my kindle.  I always read reviews and try to weed out the oh-so-average and the Twilight type books, but this one got by me.  I went back and looked, and sure enough, I overlooked a clue.  Book Description \\"readers over 18\\".  It should have been typed as a Young Adult book.  So sweet, so cliche, so clean that even the paralyzed fellow never has a BM.  The story has been told, and much better, many times before.  Did the author watch the old movie \\"Dying Young\\" and think, \\"I'll make the rich sick dude crippled and British, and make the Julia Roberts' character a short, large breasted, vintage-dressing good hearted loser and no one will recognize them.\\"  Give me a break.  I am sure many young adults will enjoy this book, and good for them.  I know I would have probably loved it at 17.  I am just disappointed at spending money for such a lightweight story.  I think that Amazon would really benefit it's readers if they had their reviewers reveal their ages.  I am too old and too grumpy to spend my money on a book that insults my intelligence.  Come on!!  The protaganist supposedly gets gang raped in castle maze as a young woman (Really!) and this makes her more modest in her dress, a stay at home type of gal with a steady boyfriend.  Oh, and by the way, the rape is just inferred.  This is only one glaring example of a writer who is writing down to people.  I guess if you like Nicholas Sparks this is one for you.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Awesome book would recommend for older readers teen and older. Makes you wonder if this could happen in our world the way things are going these days.
B009JBZH54|5.0|The set has plenty of special features.  My husband and I are big Batman fans....my husband is Batman...shhhh!  I got it as a Christmas gift.  He was very happy.  As happy as any 5 year old boy in a 40 year old man's body could be.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Convergence of cold case murder, riots in LA, overseas duty of CA national guard, international journalist, excellent detective work, commitment to human beings, bureaucratic politics, and bilingual necessity create an intriguing and informative plot. Very believable. Very sad commentary on evils of society. Very positive commentary on those who seek justice.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|I bought the first 2 seasons bc we kept seeing the 3rd advertised but didn't want to watch it and be lost. We watched both seasons in 2 days at hours at a time! It's so on the edge of your seat and very satisfied with our purchase and good price as well. Love it!
B008XX6J4C|5.0|My son started following the Piano Guys on the internet, and we've enjoyed their videos for months.  The interpretations are creative and beautiful to hear.
B007KOYEOC|3.0|I read this because I read the first two books in the series. As far as concluding the story in a satisfactory way, I think it is fair to say that &#34;Freed&#34; achieves this, although somewhat unremarkably and very predictably. I found myself skipping over the so-called juicier bits as their frequency became tedious and repetitive. It ties up all the loose ends but it didn't leave me feeling glad that I had read these books. Very light-weight fare if you are looking for any intellectual stimulation- but let's face it I don't think the mind is the region that is meant to be excited by these stories!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I am still adapting to Kindle for Android and Windows 8 and am no expert, but certainly like what I have seen so far.
B005CRQ3RK|4.0|THIS BOOK IS NICE AND FUNNY!!!!  JEFF KINNEY OUTDID<br />HIMSELF. IT IS A GREAT KIDS BOOK. IF YOU LIKE THIS , READ THE OTHER BOOKS.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|This is one of those books that will make you late because it is hard to put it down. It grabs you from the beginning with plot twists and plenty of action.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|It's awesome I have finally read.the series it's.the. best book I've ever read. I will definitely read it again!!!!! Posted by the hunger games fan
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Fun for kids and adults.  Good time passer when there's nothing else to do with the Kindle.  Free download it,
0316066524|2.0|If I hadn't been reading this a couple of pages at a time while on the toilet I would have considered it an almost complete waste of time. Aside from a smattering of brilliant passages addressing various addictions and compulsions I found the book shapeless and essentially without vision. I keep hearing about Wallace's \\"genius\\" but mostly what I picked up on was an almost ridiculous obsession with minutia and absurdly arcane detail. I probably should have started with his essays. As it is, this book pretty much put me off. I'll go back to reading Pynchon whose fluid and ambidextrous prose makes reading Wallace like plowing through the unrelenting monochromatic drone of a term paper written while under the influence of methamphetamine.
B005I6EVUG|2.0|Not the same as shown or described.  It also was received too late, days after site showed it had been received.
B002UM5BXW|4.0|I picked up this book hoping it would be a no holds barred, straightforward, foul mouthed written version of the TV Anthony Bourdain. It didn't disappoint. The book was hilarious, but thought provoking at times, too. Sadly, it did make me kind of embarrassed at my 'chef' skills. He did give several suggestions and pointers to even the most aspiring home chefs that seemed very sensible and doable. Anyway, it was a good read, but a little all over the place. He seemed to jump from topic to topic erratically. Perhaps this was to relay the hectic nature of his business. Or of his early days. Overall I would definitely recommend to fans of cooking and his shows.
B006LSZECO|1.0|I kept reading this book only hoping it was going to get better, only it never did. The story dragged on and on only to come to a rushed ending. I wish I could get a refund on the time I spent reading this crap.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app is helpful in letting me know how much battery life I have left, if its charging right and with 3 young kids constantly wanting to play they now know the limitations to some of these battery draining apps.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this is the most fun game i have evered played in my life i like creaative mode more than anything !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B000FBFN1U|5.0|This  is just as spell-binding as the previous two books. Can't decide which character I hate or love most! Martin is a master writer.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|met my expectations. The extras on the dvd makes for enjoyable review and review. Glad I purchased it as a gift for my husband.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|Couldn't pit this down. Read it on my Kindle and I had to carry it everywhere so if I had  a &#34;down&#34; minute I could keep reading!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I could not stop reading, Colleen Hoover has u hooked from the very first page to the very last, this book is sad and inspiring, Sky is an amazing girl who despite everything can still love and live, and Holder is amazing they were destined to be together and fate intervened on more than one occasion, a must read no doubt....
B000QCS8TW|5.0|My daughter tried for months to get me interested in this series...I kept dawdling. Finally, bought this ro read on my Kindle and stormed through it in days. Have also read books two and three. Love the action, the characters and the intrigue!
B000024O2D|5.0|I love the CD and Phil Collins music.<br /><br />I received the cd with other merchandise and during shipping the cd case got cracked.  The cd wasn't damaged but was a little disappointed that the case was expecially since it was a gift.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|What a great series.Gift for my me. I loved it.Why are so many words that are required? This is adding more words. Who does help?
B0013D8LCW|5.0|This is a great gay romance movie.  You never know when love will turn up and the path it takes you on.  It shows that there is more to gay men than sex.  Buy this for your collection because you will want to see it more than once.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Gift for my me. I loved it.Why are so many words that are required? This is adding more words. Who does help?
B005LAII80|5.0|This movie is a true reflection of the comic, and the storyline is solid. Very violent and some gore, but I was impressed with the movie overall. Karl Urban is true to the character.
B00AMSLRAC|4.0|This game is great, it has all the things my soon to be 3 yr. son loves best, dirt and water. It makes you think and use problem solving while planting all all the fruit and veggies. It was fun for him to plant the trees and mow the lawn also. Fun game !
B009KHBDUU|4.0|This movie was good, just not what I was expecting. I rented it because my kids wanted to watch it but regrettably, I had to kick my kids out of the room!!! If thats what you were thinking to do, think again, and as funny as it was at times, the movie was kinda dark too.
B001HN69AY|3.0|The movie was interesting, but it is not as good as the previews!!  I was a little disappointed when I viewed it
B009GIPDQS|5.0|Was awesome. Typical John Grisham didn't imagine the end of the story  was going to end that way. Loved the book
B0054JZC6E|4.0|very fun games. keeps me entertained for quite a while. addictive. a bit challenging once you keep playing for more levels.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|The app does what it says it does.  Battery life in a ton of ways. Custom colors, multiple formats, sleek functions.  I would recommend.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The best book I've ever read! Nothing beats The Hunger Games! :) I can't believe how great this book is!
0385536828|4.0|SWEET TOOTH, Ian McEwan's twelfth novel, is an intelligent, intricately detailed story of Serena Frome, a beautiful Cambridge graduate in 1972 England. Frome becomes a low-level worker at MI-5 after an older lover recommends her for the assignment. Anything else would be a spoiler, so not going to go into the plot as much as the atmosphere. McEwan, whose novels ATONEMENT, AMSTERDAM and ON CHESIL BEACH speak of class differences in historical England, has crafted a novel about the spy game that features no violence, but what amounts to a war of Cold War words. Frome tells the reader in the opening paragraph that she fails in her mission, so we read the 300 pages wondering just how she comes up short. McEwan, as usual, is a master of the detail, capturing the early 1970s in England, with the IRA bombings, three-day work weeks and the final fizzle of the counterculture with a historian's clarity. Even at his most entertaining McEwan is not easy to read, but astute fans have stayed with him through his career, myself included, and are constantly rewarded by complex characters and clever dialogue. While, in my opinion, this book doesn't match the titles listed above, it is a worthwhile outing for fans of literature and British fiction.
B00005JPCF|5.0|Well..... My 6 year old penguin-loving daughter wants to tap dance now and repeats every line from the movie. What more can I say.....
B008XG1X18|5.0|I chose 5 stars because I love pinterest! It's one of my most favorite apps! I like looking at it on my kindle more than on my iPhone since the screen is bigger. I dislike that it crashes some times when I am trying to look at something. I would recommend it to anyone whom has a kindle!
B00AEFVRB2|1.0|Could not believe that Matthew McConaughey would take a role in this type of movie.  He should be embarrassed and apologize to his fans.
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|My son loves playing this game. I would have liked it better without the ads but what can I say, it was free!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is so fun and addicting!! like that there is a good variety of games to play. definately a keeper.
B00A9X9ORI|1.0|This movie was AWFUL.  I just watched it because I like Bruce Willis but it was AWFUL.  He must have made this movie because no one else asked him for anything else.  Don't waste your time.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I was late to the party and missed this when it aired. I have been completely captivated by the series!
B00AC8ZJ6K|2.0|Not too bad but if you had not played the game, you'd be lost.  Looks like it's set for a follow up.
B003DBOS7Y|5.0|Resisted watching this for years, thought it would be sappy but really enjoyed the actors and the story very much. Watch it if you believe in love that lasts and prevails. AAAA+++++++++++++
B009HELT3C|4.0|This was a funny movie and I liked Josh Brolin as the younger version of Tommy Lee Jones.  At least you could watch it without fear of someone being chopped up etc.
B006LSZECO|5.0|i absolutely loved this book. very cleverly written.  the next day after i finished reading -it finally hit  me-- i am very impressed by the  the story and all the clues it gave
B0084IG8TM|1.0|Love the movie, but disc is crappy, can't watch certain parts of the movie, have tried everything! Not happy with company!
B002W5UVSM|3.0|his main character rambled on over and over. book could have been 1/3 less.  also<br />+knowing how he went on to live his life and end it ' i thought the book sounded like the life he was going to live--and that was so sad to me/
B0011TQLA2|5.0|I doubt I can significantly contribute to the critical reception of this album at this point in time, so I won't try. I'll just say that this is definitely one of my more favorite albums from this band (and in general), and is well worth a listen.
B003QSOE0U|4.0|Pearl Harbor gave me the feeling of being there when is happend and gave detailed relationships interwoven into the story. PEARL HARBOR
B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved the book! I thought it was great! I do not think I could choose my favorite between this and the first book but am definitely going to read the third book.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|These was a great novel, romance mixed with action. Kept the pace of the story steady. The ending creates wonder!
B005K17RU0|5.0|Good features; updates regularly automatically; Easy to switch between different locations; Reliable forecast hourly and for upto 3 days including precipitation
B002UM5BXW|5.0|Very well written, gritty, honest account. I laughed and sometimes got thoroughly lost in the story. Definitely worth the read!
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|I d loaded this game for my grand kid and she loves it and I like watching her play it<br />Ps<br />I must admit I like it as well don't tell nobody lol
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|I thought Christian Bale did a nice job dichotimizing the role between a recluse and the comeback crusader.  Anne Hathaway was a nice change of pace as Catwoman and did a great job with her role.  I have no idea who played the Bane character but I thought he was great.  All in all, a nice piece of entertainment.
B006BAEQB2|5.0|I always enjoy whatever Phillippa Gregory writes but this is really fantastic! THe research she does is phenomenal..makes me picture myself in the environment she is describing. I have not finished it yet, but I can hardly put it down. Her descriptions, her development of the characters and the intrigues in which she involves the reader make me not want the book to end. It is a delightful way to learn history. I will read whatever she writes!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I did enjoy reading this book, though in some ways it was very hard to read. To think of a young girl having to go through the things she experienced  is difficult. But at the same time it grabs your attention and her strength and unwillingness to give up are what shines through. I read it quickly and am on the third one already.
B000W93CHC|5.0|This book is just great, with an interesting plot and historical retrieving!<br />Lots of good information.<br />Reading becomes better if made after &#34;The Pillars ...&#34;.
B000X1Z0BU|5.0|After seeing the Broadway production of Once, I wanted to compare it to the movie.  Somehow, I was thinking it might not be as entertaining, but it exceeded my expectations, and it was a treat to see the original main characters, which was why I ordered it anyway.
B00493E1GI|4.0|I liked the film and it's a great way to Dolce Far Niente. The imagery is lovely in the film, the acting... well it's okay.
B002ZG99TK|4.0|It was a decent movie. Kind of predictable but was interesting. Never saw the movie before and it was fairly cheap during black Friday so I bought it. Would probably not watch it again but was good to see once.
034580404X|2.0|like i was reading twilight with sex .... terrible, third book is probably the best. but dont get your hopes up
B0060ZJ7BC|5.0|Very good movie! Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill do a really good job in this movie. Saw it in theaters and really liked it so I bought it. Definitely go see it if you have not yet.
B004K4IZ3G|5.0|Love this movie and was in good condition when I recieved the package wrapped nice. No wear and tear on DVD plays fine.
B005IZLPMY|5.0|This was an awesome movie! When I first saw the movie I knew that I wanted to buy it, it was that good! I bought it on black friday during the lightning movie deals so I got a good price. Definitely worth it.!
B008K6HN8I|5.0|This free app helped me find my camera on the Kindle Fire HD. Reccomend it very highly. A nice app.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I just finished and this is getting better with every turn of the page (so to speak), on to the next one.
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|Way to slow on take up. I would not recommend this to any one unless you like to spend lots of money.
B000SEGMAU|5.0|I would recommend this to anyone who has gone through a loss of a a friend or family member.  I gained so much from it after reading it.  My wife recently passed away.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I am surprised that I enjoyed this book as much as I did. Christian is a wonderful wreck of perfection.
B0081JPTCQ|1.0|Purchased this app a few months ago and find that I simply do not use it. Would probably be more likely to use if I had a smart phone and it was on there.,
B005EGXNLS|5.0|Bernard Cornwell has done it again. Uhtred's newest adventure in middle ages England is up to Cornwell's prior standards. Exciting!
B009SJ3LHI|4.0|Really neat enjoyable show. Great story line, even with a different a guy playing the Green Arrow from Smallville, but he's absolutely handsome.
B007TNS6JI|4.0|Like many of the games from Gameloft, in order to get the premium equipment, you will have to pay real coin and dollars to acquire the virtual coins and dollars.  I understand that that is part of the business,  I just don't always agree with it.  I do like that Gameloft still leaves avenues of play for those of us who don't like spending real money on virtual products but like to play the games.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This show is great, really draws you in, and the story line and special effects are amazing...really fascinating to watch!!!
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Each generation is better than the last!!! I hope the developers can continue as I do enjoy the  challenges and fun.
B0000DJZ8R|5.0|I bought this after watching the Ken Burns &#34;dust Bowl&#34; documentary. A real eye opener for just how bad the &#34;okies&#34; were treated by our own peope. It also proves the that the private sector is not willing or interested in the greater well-being of citizens.
B00A757EFW|5.0|For as many years as Pac-Man has been around, I have always been a fan and that will probably not change.
1449410243|5.0|Great book! Hilarious, it will keep you laughing for a long time. Great for gifts, and a great coffee table book.
B003XVYLDU|5.0|Good read, has a few weird ideas but overall very interesting and well structured. Nothing else to say but I needed to make this enough words.
B004SD5GZ4|4.0|It seems to work just fine. I have been able to open any pdf files needed using this app. No problems at all that I can see.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|I like to have weather info available as I travel, and being able to check the weather out from any Wi-Fi spot is quite handy, especially during the winter months when storms can pop up anytime and affect your driving and your route.  The app works quite well for that.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Bad ending in my opinion.  Interestingly written and kept my attention, but the ending left me feeling that I wish I hadn't spent the time reading it.  Won't recommend it to others.
B004SD5GZ4|4.0|Still getting used to it on my Kindle Fire HD, but so far I like it better than the included pdf reader.  May add thoughts later, as I use it more.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Exciting roller coaster of a journey!  Couldn't  wait to see what would happen next!  Flynn thought of every angle.  Frightening for anyone who crosses her...
B00A80SHFM|4.0|Granted that it's only highlight i still found the music breathtaking.  Samantha Barks as Eponine blows me away, her voice is so beautiful.  Hugh Jackman was a little horse at time but he had his moments. Russel Crowe surprised me, he is actually a pretty good singer. Amanda Seyfried is a little to high-pitched for me but she's still excellent. Ann Hathaway's performance was so powerful and emotional i almost teared up. So worth buying but i hope a complete version comes out so i can listen to all the songs.
B007BT0RKG|3.0|Good stuff..will come in handy..those times I am waiting in line or at work..tks for this great stuff. It is very useful.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Easy reading and kind of hard to follow as it jumps around... but due to the historical impact this &#34;event&#34; had on all of us... I had to buy the book and read it to see what it was all about it... and make up my own mind.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Kathleen Grissom did a wonderful job of bringing her characters alive.  I cheered for them, cried for them and celebrated their strong spirits with them.
B00AFWEPVI|4.0|Great product. Haven't had a lot of time to use it. Looking forward to using it when grandkids come up and ball games get started. maybe by then we will have gotten pretty good at using to.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|One of the best books I have read in awhile. I honestly did not put it down all day. Great read from the very first word til the very last!!!
B0001I562I|5.0|This is an old movie that has become a classic.  we saw it years ago and we bought it for our dvd library.
B0091LS07E|5.0|very nice CD and shipment is quickly. nothing need to say any more. the songs come from alicia keys are always perfect
B000JPRPAO|5.0|Sat this on Showtime the other weekend, I had heard of it before but I never saw.  I decided to check it out and it has just enough amount of action and never lost my interest
B008OTTRXU|5.0|Basically got the album for one song, but actually like the whole album.<br />Got it on time and like it
B003XVYLDU|3.0|The story was disjointed but I did agree with some of his philosophies - it was a reread for me.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|all I can say is love love love love love love and I would like more levels to play soon..
1574216988|3.0|This book is okay for the topic.  I was sucked in by the Zentangle fad and had to have it, but all the books on the topic are basically the same.
B0067R0APK|4.0|Great app, easy to read and configure. My only problem is when they say an advisory is in effect it doesn't say what exactly is going on.
B00APUQT7I|5.0|I have all of these movies, and this one is my favorite!<br /><br />&#34;When you drink water from your trunk, does it taste like boogers?&#34;...love it:)
B00APUYWYA|5.0|This was an excellent waste of time.<br />My dog didn't mind my loud laughter and I didn't have to leave the house to see a good movie.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Such a good book!<br />Can't put the second book down for the life of me! Written as i would write myself
B006LSZECO|5.0|Loved this book!  The plot seemed easy to figure out, but every time I thought I knew I'd figured it out, I was surprised.  Twist after twist, and I love that you got a perspective from two characters.  I wasn't thrilled with the ending, but I think it leads up to a part 2.  It was very interesting and always kept you on your toes and continuously thinking and trying to figure out what was next.
B004SOR4H6|4.0|I chose twitter because it is a great social net work for me it has great topics and there is lots of difference people on it twitter  such lawyers,Doctors , teachers , ect that  has a lots of subject matters , marriage, spiritual topic lots of subject you never be bored while on twitter, nice picture to cover.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I wanted to read the book before I watched the movie and was not disappointed!!<br />Ready for book two and more.....keep them coming Suzanne Collins.
B002L5KKK2|5.0|Strong story of a boy growing up and the choices he must make. It also shows the importance of those adults who are part of his life. The actors are well chosen. Musical score fits the time and movie.
B004LQI1PA|5.0|The sound and quality were great (I streamed this), and of course the performance of the Les Mis cast and crew is outstanding.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|This game starts with the classic match 3 concept and blends it with  hidden object round and an engaging storyline. The game is playable through several levels with only a modest increase in difficulty, resulting in engaging play without serious frustration too early.
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|The soundtrack is made up of the exact movie sound clips. If you enjoyed the movie, you will enjoy this soundtrack.
B004LWZW9M|4.0|service was fast and we enjoyed the movie alot.  great movie for NYE 2012 movie night.great cast and I love Bon Jovi
B005LAJ16I|1.0|After reading all the positive reviews, I expected that this would be a series worth watching. Unfortunately, it wasn't. I did not realize that such explicit sexual scenes would be on this and the language is shocking! I will not recommend this show to anyone. Nudity, explicit sex, and filthy language.Very Disappointed!!!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love using Pinterest. You always find something you love and want to try; recipes, crafts, diy's, fashion, etc... I always look forward to my time on Pinterest.
B0015AARJI|3.0|I ordered and paid for this product which was promised to be delivered well before Christmas. It may have been shipped on time but Fedex dropped the ball. Apparently it was in a local wear house for around a week. These two items were an important part of my sons' gifts. Showed up several days after Christmas. As far as the game, I don't have time to play games.
1594135851|5.0|This book was &#34;used&#34; but you would never know it.  I didn't realize I purchased the large print!! It is making it's way around my department and no one has to wear their contact to read it!
B000JO9JHW|5.0|Dexter has it all! it is awesome! it is a great series and we hope it lasts a long time, to come!
B000QCS8TW|4.0|Not a bad read at all. Go stories throughout and some suspense as well. Characters seem real. Not sure if there will be more fantasy in the coming books or not but so far there isn't too much.
B000002J6H|5.0|When replacing my LP's at first I  could not find this or forgot to look for it, but it helps to have this in any collection if you care for CS&N, Springfield or other Stills endeavers.  Stills at his best.
1616960922|5.0|Sanderson does it again. A standalone novella working along similar but different magic mixed with science and history lines.  It was a nice change to have a read in one sitting book as while I love Sanderson's books I also need sleep!<br /><br />Great read
0321701763|4.0|I purchased this book for a Photoshop class. I found it easy overall easy to follow.  What I would recommend is to practice selection tools before doing the exercises.  The book tells you what to do, but sometimes there are mini-steps that would be easier to learn from video than from a textbook.
B000S6UZME|5.0|I liked this movie as a kid and seeing it on blue ray is the cream of the crop. The price and speed of the shipping was great.
B00005R5G9|5.0|I grew up watching this film, my favorite quote from it is from Hollywood. &#34;My momma put the coins on my eyes and I still don't believe it!&#34; Meshach Taylor is AWESOME!
0765325950|5.0|I think the title says it all.  It was a fantastic ending to what is one of the greatest fantasy saga's ever written.<br /><br />It it is shame to see all these 1 star reviews that have nothing to do with the book itself, but instead are railing against the kindle release.<br /><br />Don't let them deter you.  it was great.
B00AMBLDEE|4.0|This movie is pretty good.  I really like the continuity between the other Borne movies.  I just wish the ending had more fighting.
B001LRJH0K|3.0|This flick is a little different. I would give it a full 5 Stars for Costuming, and Another 5 for the use of the scenery. A very &#34;Beautiful&#34; movie, unfortunately the interaction between the characters is a little oddly played. And I forgot what it was about while zoning out on the overdrawn scenery shots.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|So glad I finally read this. It was better than expected. You start to feel as though you really know the characters
B000VIK8D0|5.0|We love this flick!! Mr. Costner is BADASS as usual, and Dennis Quaid pulls off Doc holiday better than Val Kilmer. If you liked Tombstone.... You really need to see this one.
B00A31UXLW|3.0|This latest Connelly book failed to grab me. I Found it  totally predictable and lacking in originality. Not the dynamic Bosch we're used to.
B007N8RULO|4.0|I do like this app, however, it's not as easy to follow as the version on Windows 7.  Maybe it's the design on the cards and the placement of the deck of cards.
0765325950|1.0|I have no issue dropping 20 - 40 bucks for this book, even if all they sold at launch was a combo of the ebook and the hardcover for 40 bucks I would have paid it, read my ebook and put the hardcover on my shelf as a reminder of the series that got me started in fantasy novels.<br /><br />The way it is now, I will need find some other way to get the ebook prior to the April launch which may lead to me not contributing any $$ to the last book in this series. very sad :(
B004I744AS|5.0|This dictionary is very good.  This dictionary offers a comprehensive explanation for every definition.  Recommend this app to everybody who likes to have a good dictionary at their fingertips.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Downton Abbey pulled one out of the fire by allowing the wedding of Matthew and Mary to go on..I feared that as in classic, predictable plot lines, the writers would throw their relationship to the wolves...an easy write. But they didn't. They surprised us! Just another reason why I LOVE Downton Abbey! (And Julian Fellowes..who, by the way, I thought should have won the heart of fair maiden, Molly on Monarch of the Glen!)
0393307050|4.0|Love this book. Gets overly detailed with antique sailing lingo which may bore some readers, but if you can deal with that then great characters and adventures.
B00A757EFW|5.0|I love it.  It presents a challenge and I don't want to put it down.  It's like the Pac-Man game I had years ago.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|just a great book, the mind of steven king is something else, his time travel senerio is great, he is and always been well before his time
B0063IH60K|3.0|It's just okay.  I usually play the random, it's quick and easy and a good way to take a short break from work.
B00A7CF1QY|4.0|I have read the whole series of books and loved them, the movies are just as good, keep you on the edge of your seat
B0015DYIH2|3.0|Well first of this book was good. But didn't have the action I was anticipating. I didn't like the description of what Jacob saw cause I was eating. But all together this book was good. I enjoyed it.
B00A23MYCC|5.0|great movie great story line and great end to movie, it was put together well, and very entertaining worth owning
0761171703|5.0|this book is a great, it's joyous and incredible. The photos almost jump off the page at you.  Some of them look impossible and that much more incredible.  I had to flip through each one franticly  before going back and reading though slowly and checking each picture again.  Overall a fabulous purchase, it's a coffee table book for me as it intrigues just about everyone.
B002XXLKHY|4.0|It is an amusing family movie which was enjoyed thoroughly by my children (8 and 5)  While Will Ferrell can be a bit annoying in his comic excess, my children laughed out loud over his antics during several parts of the movie.
1416955070|1.0|I only wish I'd have read dreamsend's review of this book before reading it.  Coupled with what dreamsend said (and I highly recommend you read that review), here are my additional comments: I was disgusted by the blatant theft of all things HP. It was despicable. Also? I was given this book on the suggestion of a friend. Her 10-year old had read it and loved it. I was reading it with my 10-year old. Until I had to edit it, because the discussion of orgies, MILF's, teen drinking (and not really in a frowned-upon way), teen sex, teen drug use and incest were prevailing themes. I am not a prude. We have read the Twilight Saga together, all of Harry Potter, the Hunger Games, and she's a huge LotR fan. But these? These were really books for much older YA's. Normally she reads, then I read, then she reads...you get the picture. I couldn't let her even see the words on the page, because I had no idea where it was going to go. But really, if the story had been worth it, or original in ANY WAY, I would not have minded the edits. It was a waste of time, and I will not be wasting money on the movie.
0765325950|1.0|If you want to make me buy the hardcover, why can't you at least also include the digital copy? It does not cost them anything extra and is no different then me scanning my book from the digital rights perspective. The fact that these publishers can't see the simple ways to make me HAPPY to give them extra money for a book is astonishing. I'll just wait for the paperback or for my library to get a copy. Ridiculous.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love this app!<br />I love playing this.  Its great to pass time and I like how the cards move. I have been addicted the last few days.

What I mean is that the women's movement brought discrimination of women into the spotlight, the civil rights movement raised our awareness of what's it like to be other than white.  Our gay/lesbian/bisexual/transgender population has also struggled against discrimination for many year years, and it is only now, in limited states, that same sex couples are able to legally marry.  Awareness, understanding, acceptance and support is everything!<br /><br />As an introvert, I've felt some level of discrimination most of my life.  School, work, family events, etc.  It's exhausting to try to be something you're not.  I have felt very alone.  I know that there has been MUCH work done on this subject and I probably have every book there is about it.  I believe our time has finally come though.  Enough layers of the onion of discrimination have been peeled back so that our voices, through Susan's very eloquent voice, are now able to be heard.  I just hope that enough extroverts stop talking long enough to truly hear us, acknowledge us and value us just as we are.

B008K5T5AI|4.0|Ian M. Banks invented The Culture, and it's one of science fiction's more impressive creations.<br /><br />This novel fills in some more detail about the way The Culture works, and that alone makes it well worth reading. The plot is more of Ian M. Banks being rude about the military and the singular unpleasantness of war, much in the tradition of &#34;Consider Phelbas&#34;, and I'd have been happier with a slightly less space-operatic narrative, but novelists have got to find some kind of narrative skeleton onto which to hang their creations and we've got to be happy when they find something that works for them.<br /><br />Bill Sloman, Sydney

B009VB998I|4.0|My family began watching these movies several years ago for my daughter. We, as parents, prefer the strong-mindedness and individuality of Tink over the assortment of princess movies Disney churns out. The first installment, the origin of Tinker Bell, was well done, and we especially loved the depth to which the creators have fleshed out her world. The second and third installments were also fun: full of adventure, humor, and lessons for the younger audience. In this latest addition, the characterization of Tinker Bell branches out even further by given her a sibling and introducing us to another facet of Pixie Hollow: the winter woods.<br /><br />I can't stress this enough: as the dad of a daughter, I love Tink's inventiveness and creativity. She doesn't give up, she's helpful, and she's courageous. That's a &#34;role model&#34; that girls growing up on Disney have lacked for generations.<br /><br />PS. I gave it a 4 because it's a cartoon movie for kids. 5's are for The Shawshank Redemption, Pulp Fiction, and any movie with a superhero in it.
