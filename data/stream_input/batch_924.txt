B002BSHWUU|5.0|I ordered my box set on Sept. 9th and received it in the mail today, October 9 - John's birthday. Thanks, John! :-)  Having been somewhat suspicious about everything I'd read being hype, I can now honestly say that this was worth both the price and the wait.  The sound quality is greatly improved and it's so much fun to listen with headphones on, picking up little things that weren't very audible before.  Plus the packaging is fantastic.  Each cd comes with a booklet, and I love it that they used lesser-seen photographs of the band.  It's like being back in in childhood when I would lay on my bed and pour over the photos, lyrics, and liner notes of an album.  Can't wait to get the mono set, too!
0307588335|5.0|The book provides a \\"slow motion\\" snap shots of what lead up to the demise of the Lehman Brothers(LB) from an insider's closeup. The inner working of the company was intricate and fascinating,with best of the best professionals playing the high stake wagers day-in and day-out,yet collectively LB was in a total denial as it engulfed and overcame by its own greed/hubris!The total lack of common sense leading to the downfall of this institution was unbelievable and shameful! I feel this is a must read for any stock investor and it has definitely help me understand the \\"Wall Street psychic!\\"
0385341008|4.0|What a pleasure of a book to read.  Particularly, if you enjoy reading books in the format of a series of letters and communications, you will find this as pleasing as Helene Hanff's 84 Charing Cross Road.  I hope that, like Charing Cross Rd., this will become a movie, too.<br /><br />This is a quick read,sadly.  I was left wanting more, and wondering how the characters lives progressed.<br /><br />The authors evoked fond memories of wonderful, childhood holidays in Guernsey, and they also protrayed its German occupation, well.<br /><br />This is a bittersweet and gentle book, plan on adding it to your \\"must read\\" list.
0385737947|4.0|Think \\"Lord of the Flies\\" meets \\"the Matrix\\"... this is the story of Thomas, who wakes up in an elevator lift with no memory of who he is or how he got there. He is deposited into a glade that is surrounded on all sides by huge stone walls. He meets the other boys who live in the Glade and quickly learns that each boy has a job to do and all jobs center around the group's survival. Outside the stone walls lies an ever changing maze, and the only way to escape is to solve the puzzle.     While science fiction is not my typical genre of choice, I really really enjoyed reading this book.  It hooked me right from the start and was a great page turner.  Absolutely recommend, and can't wait for the sequel
B002EWD0I6|5.0|I have been waiting for this series to be released here in the United States, and watched it within two days. I have to admit that I have yet to read the book (of the same name) by Flora Thompson that this series is based on (I plan to do so soon). The book is said to be semi-autobiographical but I can't really comment on how faithful the series is to the book since I've yet to read it. My review as such will be confined to the BBC drama.<br /><br />The story follows the lives of the inhabitants of the poor, sleepy hamlet of Lark Rise and the more affluent and snooty inhabitants of Candleford during the last decades of the 19th century (sometime in the 1880s I believe). The central character Laura Timmins (Olivia Hallinan) is a young girl from Lark Rise who is sent by her parents to work as an assistant to the postmistress, the capable and sensible Dorcas Lane (a brilliant Julia Sawalha). Initially Laura balks at the more restrained and formal way of life in Candleford, and is humiliated by the way some of the town's more snobbish inhabitants (such as the Pratt sisters, Pearl and Ruby, credibly portrayed by Matilda Ziegler and Victoria Hamilton) look down upon her, but she gradually finds satisfaction and a measure of happiness in her job and new surroundings, and comes to develop a true understanding of the inhabitants of both Lark Rise and Candleford, in all their complexities. Julia Sawalha is amazing in her role as the kind postmistress who acts as a sort of mentor to young Laura, and whose own life seems deceptively straightforward, despite some undercurrents, brought on by her close friendship with town squire, Sir Timothy Midwinter (Ben Miles) who is married to a city girl,the cool and composed Lady Adelaide (Olivia Grant).<br /><br />To delve too much into the plot would detract from the viewer's pleasure, and so all I will say is that this excellent series has everything to recommend it - a wonderful score, beautiful cinematography of the lush English countryside, and plenty of human drama, dealing with social issues, marital strife, forbidden desires, love across the different social classes,friendship, and lots of good old-fashioned humor.The ensemble cast is excellent and a delight to watch, engaging viewer's interest from the first episode till the last of the season, and I was sorry to see it come to an end. Luckily for fans, there is [[ASIN:B002VWOMZ4 Lark Rise to Candleford: The Complete Season Two]], and [[ASIN:B003TY2STA Lark Rise to Candleford: Season Three]].ty of human drama, dealing with social issues, marital strife, forbidden desires, love across the different social classes,friendship, and lots of good old-fashioned humor.The ensemble cast is excellent and a delight to watch, engaging viewer's interest from the first episode till the last of the season, and I was sorry to see it come to an end.

0385504225|3.0|My father, grandfather, uncles and brothers were/are Masons.  My Dad was a 33rd degree Mason, so the possibility that there is evil intent in Freemasonry is such a foreign concept to me. When the reason for the CIA's involvement becomes clear, all I could think was, \\"How ridiculous.\\"      That said, \\"The Lost Symbol\\" was typical Dan Brown.  The plot moves at a furious pace, there is little character development, and Langdon gets the bad guy.  I enjoyed all of his books because they teach as well as entertain.      In my mind, Brown will have a difficult time writing a novel better than \\"The DaVinci\\" code.
0441013597|5.0|Well I really liked the novel. I was transformed into a fan after watching the movie. However the novel is far more complex and satisfying. The interplay of religion and politics was very clearly and cleverly dealt with. Paul's inner turmoil of starting something so big that he would not be able to control it himself mirrors our present day societies. I really want to talk more but it would be giving out too much. Read it and have a blast...

B000UNYJXQ|5.0|\\"Sicko\\" should be required viewing for all Americans. Finally the truth about corporations and pharmaceuticals controlling the health care industry and those in Congress. I laughed, I cried, I became even more angry than I already am that this country refuses to give us socialized medicine. The lies that have been told about other countries' socialized medicine plans are astounding (and something I already knew about, having lived in other countries as I was growing up). That we are the only western industrialized nation without socialized medicine and who think nothing of people losing their houses and going bankrupt over medical issues makes me so ashamed of this country and the passive voters who do not make their representatives accountable to the whole country. Health care is not an issue of GOP vs. Democrats, it is a HUMAN issue.  Ask yourself why we don't take better care of each other than that.  Why is an inhaler in Cuba 5 cents when it costs $150 in America?
B00007AJGH|3.0|Movie is great my son loved it but there is 10 minutes or so where the image is very bad.
1439102813|5.0|It broke my heart to see even a fictional character with early onset Alzheimer's disease suffer as Alice did. It was to be expected since the degenerative course of this disease is inevitable, despite the medical trials and treatments that Alice and her science savvy family thoroughly researched and pursued. But I find even more disheartening the callousness of the medical profession and no mention of occupational therapy which can alleviate some of the stress and improve quality of life for the patient and family.<br /><br />By callousness, I mean a doctor giving a devastating diagnosis without the presence of a supportive family member. Thoughts of suicide are a likely response that any doctor must consider. Then there was the social worker who couldn't think even slightly outside the box enough to create a new support group for dementia victims- when Alice so cogently explained the need.<br /><br />So what could an occupational therapist have done for Alice? To begin with- find out what Alice and her family needed in terms of information and support and help her find it. Next adapt her home- label the doors, drawers, refrigerator and anything else that would help her identify where she was and what she needed. Remove clutter and objects such as that darned black rug that created visual delusions.  Provide a large white board for simple information such as \\"John is taking me to a restaurant at 7:00\\" that Alice could independently look at. Her family could have then pointed to the board each time Alice asked what time they were leaving.<br /><br />Alice's family did some nice brainstorming- substituting movies for the books she could no longer read, discovering that plays were easier to read than novels. But an occupational therapist is trained to adapt activities according to the Alzheimer's patient's ever changing cognitive, perceptual and motor status. As the patient moves into the later stages of the disease and responds mostly with the senses rather than coherent thoughts- a therapists looks at ways to stimulate-using music, touch and other sensory modalities in  ways unfamiliar to the average caregiver.<br /><br /> I loved this story, Lisa Genova's slowly unfolding drama and insight into the interior worlds of Alice as well as her family's devastation and copying mechanisms. Reading Still Alice was a pleasure, although haunting and sad. I can't wait to read her next novel. But at the same time- I wish I could have been Alice's occupational therapist. It would have been a different type of story.<br /><br />Barbara Smith, M.S., author of \\"Still Giving Kisses: A Guide to Helping and Enjoying the Alzheimer's Victim You Loveent thoughts- a therapists looks at ways to stimulate-using music, touch and other sensory modalities in  ways unfamiliar to the average caregiver.<br /><br /> I loved this story, Lisa Genova's slowly unfolding drama and insight into the interior worlds of Alice as well as her family's devastation and copying mechanisms.

0452289963|5.0|A New Earth is profound in its simplicity. It is an easily digestible guide on how to improve your life and well-being through detaching yourself from your ego, which is the root of all toxic energy and negative thinking. The book patiently guides you through understanding what the ego really consists of, as well as the pain-body, and how you can avoid feeding into it over and in time, and from there \\"create space\\" through which you could lead a present and awakened life. You also learn about the benefit of stillness itself. What spoke to me most was what Tolle writes about energy, about how we and every object on Earth are filled with it, and how a greater realization of it helps you become more connected with the great pattern and purpose of the universe. This is not cheap pop-psychobabble, but a deeply earnest and intelligent way of thinking that is direct, makes sense, and is of great benefit to anyone ready and willing to listen. Unassuming in power, it is a necessary book that everyone should connect with.

0385504225|5.0|I am such a fan of DaVinci Code and Angels and Demons. I did not think The Lost Symbol would be able to live up to the thrill of its predecessors.  I was wrong.  The Lost Symbol has become my new favorite and I am ready to book a flight to D.C.!!  A great read - Dan Brown's writing is truly sublime!!
0061767581|2.0|I wanted to read this book because I was curious to see how good or bad it really was. I used to watch Laguna Beach and the first couple seasons of The Hills so I wasn't expecting much. While it wasn't the worst thing I've read I'm glad I borrowed it from the library and didn't spend my hard earned money on it.        As said by previous reviewers, there is next to no character development and the story is jumpy as well as fairly predictable. My biggest complaint is that there is no real ending, it just cuts off. I actually wondered if the book was defective and the last couple chapters had been left out. After reading some of the reviews I now understand it's meant to be a cliffhanger to set it up for the next book. Most books in a series can also stand alone but this one ends like it was just not finished. Sadly, I will probably read the other books in this series because I can never seem to learn my lesson but I will most definitely borrow from the library.       Other than that if you're looking for something fluffy to read just to occupy your time this would be it. Consider it \\"mind candy\\" :)
B002MTTZ5I|5.0|This band gets it.  And if you don't, you never will.  This is nothing short of a masterpiece and should be mandatory listening for any headbanger.  It's a graduate course in 80s metal.  Forget Anvil, this is the metal comeback of the year.
0385504225|4.0|I can't believe the one star reviews, but I understand that it may not be 5 stars. Is Dan Brown a formulaic writer? Yes, without a doubt. Is the formula good? I think so. You don't sell that many books if they are no good. The bottom line for me is that is may not be a classic with staying power and I am not inclined to read it again, but while I was reading it I didn't want to put it down. It is a thriller novel, and for what it is I think it is great.
B00243FQFA|5.0|Great and even better than season 4 . A must for fans of the series
1932100660|1.0|Now I have no problem with a blatant promotion of veganism, but I take issue with trying to hide behind the China Study. This book is not the China Study. Campbell spends a large portion of the book stating his formal credentials trying desperately to get you to believe anything he says based on his credentials. \\"Trust me I'm the expert. Don't think for yourself. Don't read the actual studies on your own. I will interpret for you what to think about the studies.\\" That is the impression I get from this book. Campbell would have you believe that an essential nutrient such as protein is a poison, especially complete animal proteins. He states that wealthy people who adapted western lifestyles in third world countries began to eat more animal protein and their health declined. He doesn't mention they also ate processed, refined sugars too. If you read Weston Price's amazing work you would quickly understand that it is the processed, refined carbohydrates and foods that really create the problems. There really has never been a vegan culture ever in the history of humanity. There was a group in India that was vegetarian and they were the least healthy of any of the primitive cultures. They incorporated insects and milk to help get vital nutrients such as B12 and quality protein. Campbell says wheat and soy are among the safest proteins. Really?! Nearly everyone has at least some form of sub-clinical gluten sensitivities according to many experts, and the damning research on soy is abundant. Campbell insists that the diet that has NEVER existed in all of humanities history and is missing essential nutrients is the optimal diet for mankind. This is absurd, and no serioius scientist could possibly concur with his thesis.
B002KQ6BT6|1.0|There must be a book in between The DaVinci Code and The Lost Symbol that features Robert Langdon being a casualty of some catastrophic event that makes him suddenly stupid. You're world renowned specialist in symbology and the like and it's hard for you to believe some not that far fetched Mason ideas (in the context of symbology) that are not really all that unbelievable AND you can barely figure out each puzzle that is presented to you?    How convenient of Dan Brown to not only write commercial breaks into the book, but to also put recaps every few pages of what happened the page before... just in case you didn't read it the first time...even though it was like a page and a half ago.    Dan Brown might as well have just gone ahead and called Bellamy Morgan Freedman.      Dan, you know that crazy mysterious obelisk... the one that you make seem so mystical to have here in the US when the origins are Egyptian... you DO know there's an ACTUAL Egyptian obelisk in Central Park right?     How many times does it take for the answer to be \\"right in front of you\\" before you figure out that it might be a good idea to look right in front of you?    And finally, the plot... thin and weak.  The whole \\"Lost Word\\" concept... WEAK!  Even if it was an actual word with actual mystical powers...
0894803123|4.0|The ice cream recipes are very good, especially the strawberry ice cream recipe.  As for the baking section, I've tried the chocolate chip cookies which were very good!  But, I also tried the brownie layer ice cream cake which came out terribly wrong.  As someone said earlier, the proportions were all wrong, majorly.  We had to end up eating the brownie cake layers by themselves which were very thick and rich.  It didn't end up working out as an ice cream cake at all.  I was very disappointed!  Especially since it was supposed to be a birthday cake.
B0000DJE9R|5.0|Even in the 80's, when his rise to stardom was on it's way, I loved watching him dance. And now after all these years, the songs still make ya want to stand up and dance. Enjoy this video very much, and so does my grand kids.
B002JM1VJG|4.0|I have been waitng years & years for this to finally come out. I couldn't be more happy with the quality, the packaging of the collection, everything.

B002KDUDG6|1.0|Let me preface this by saying that I own every album that Michael Buble has put out (even them old ones), and while he undoubtedly peaked with his self titled album, every album since has had less and less to offer. Much like the way  movie sequels try to top their predecessors, these albums seem to want to be bigger and better, but just seem to fall short each time. \\"It's Time,\\" while undoubtedly a great great album that solidified his stardom, seemed to lack that same charm as the previous one. \\"Call me Irresponsible\\" suffered even more from this. Poor song choices abound. Enter \\"Crazy Love,\\" a catastrophe of an album. I've listened to the album a few times now, to be as fair as possible in this review. But it's so hard to ignore the flaws in it, and I love me some Buble.     You can tell something is horribly wrong with the first song, \\"Cry Me a River.\\"  Unless Michael was asked by the James Bond movie franchise to write a song for them, this song is just a horrible miscalculation in terms of arrangement. Imagine Darth Vader is walking down a long hallway, sinister and evil as always, and then BAM....Michael pops out of nowhere with this song. It sounds crazy, I know. What follows isn't much better. Instead of making the songs truly his own, it seems he's content with just punching a word here or there differently than the original singer. I don't want to go so far as to say, \\"butcher,\\" but I'm not far from it.     While this album still has some charm and is worth listening to, I cannot ignore the fact that it is subpar. Watch out with this one.
B002KDUDG6|4.0|Buble has done it again with a album that has great production and will be a consistent performer.  But remember, Buble is first an entertainer and second a singer.  You must see him live to fully appreciate his talent.  While this album does not hit every song out of the park, it is very good and has creative arrangements that may be a little unique, but keeps him squarely in his sweet spot!  He's a crooner and he does his job well on this album.      Here is a run down on the each song:  1 - Cry Me a River:  Has a grand, bold start and is done very well.  But if you do not like this arrangement, do not stop--it is not the theme of the album. (#4 is!)    2 - All of Me:  This is a classic!  \\"Why not take All of Me!\\"  Great brass blasts!    3 - Georgia On My Mind:  not always been a favorite, he does it well.  It will be fun to hear in concert in ATLANTA!!!    4 - Crazy Love:  Right from \\"She's Having a Baby!\\"  (Penned by Van Morrison but made popular by the movie)  This is a timeless ballad.  Of course, I Love It!  More importantly, he continues to remake modern music and not just for the Cole Porter era.    5 - Haven't Met You Yet:  A Buble original.  It is good, but I know it will grow on me and become a favorite.  Nice lyrics and the brass section does it nice with a trumpet call out.    6 - All I Do Is Dream of You:  From Singing in the Rain...very cute song.  The kids are going to like that one.  This is the song that they sang at the after glow party where Debbie Reynolds comes out of the cake.  Bravo!  Great song selection!    7 - Hold On: Sounds like an original ballad.  Sort of sleepy.  I will skip this song in the future.    8 - Heartache Tonight:  The old Eagles tune.  It is OK but if this song was representative of the whole album, I would never buy it.    9 - You're Nobody Till Somebody Loves You:  they front loaded this album.  This one will have to grow on me but it is better than 7 & 8.    10 - Baby, You've Got What it Takes:  this songs takes on a Motown feel and he has a woman named Sharon Jones sing with him.  There is an orchestra in the back ground.  Think Buble sings with Amy Winehouse.  This song works very well.    11 - At This Moment:  Made famous by MJ Fox on Family Ties.  He does it great justice.  I like it.     12 - Stardust:  This version sounds like The Mills Brothers are performing as back up for this Nat King Cole remake!  So, I love it!  I think it is a very organic song that flows so naturally.      13 - Whatever It Takes:  never heard this before.  It is very nice.  With a soaring orchestra, cool electric guitar solo and Buble singing his best, this song continues to grow on you as it plays.  Some other dude (Ron Sexsmith) sings that sounds similar to Buble and is a nice complement.    Yes, I will definitly add this one to my Buble collection.
0810993139|3.0|This book is not supposed to be literature and it isn't supposed to be thought provoking.  It is supposed to be funny.  I found this book to be quite humorous and was often reminded of something from my school days.  If this gets kids reading, I am all for it.  It is no worse than reading the Twilight series.  I am looking forward to reading the next installment and hope I laugh just as much if not more.
1439138311|2.0|I don't know what kept me reading this tedious book. I guess to see if something would ever happen. Not much did, until page 178, and even then it didn't help. I wonder why a man chose to write this woman's story. Perhaps it's semi-biographical, of someone in his family, his mother maybe.     There was too much narration, too much telling instead of showing. Instead of telling us that a character said such and such, the author should let the person speak the words. Dialogue is more interesting than the author telling us what someone said.
B000TRXN6W|2.0|When I first got this, I had also gotten several other albums and didn't really pay much attention to it. I loved Norah's first two releases, but \\"Not Too Late\\" didn't grab me right away (the politicized stuff was noteworthy only in that it was blatant and had been talked about in reviews), so I kind of forgot about it for a while. When I recently loaded it back up on my MP3 player for a listen with fresh ears several months later, I was actually disappointed. I don't know if it's the new songwriting, or if it's the baggage of \\"political writing\\" that weighs down what used to be very evocative work, or if it's just Norah fatigue, but I just didn't get into it. There are a couple of good tracks that I'd rather append to 'Come Away With Me' as my personal version of bonus tracks, but overall, I don't care for this work.
0385504225|2.0|I have been an avid fan of Dan Brown's novels, but can not give a good recommendation to this one. While it starts out as another page-turner following his now well-established formula, it loses steam about thre quarters of the way into the book. At this point, the climax of the story is reached (not a very exciting one) and the rest of the plot seems to exist just to explain the many loose-ends that were developed earlier, but not fully integrated into the story-line. It feels as if the author suddenly rushed to meet a deadline before he was truly finished thinking the plot through.    To be fair, I immensely enjoyed most of this book and got a kick out of staying up late to finish it. It has all of the excitement and cliff-hanging qualities of his previous novels. It just peters out in the end.
0312370849|3.0|First, I, like I imagine most readers, had never heard of the Vel' d'Hiv', in which some 4,000 Jews were rounded up in 1942 by the French police and shipped off to the gas chambers.  So, if for no other reason than it highlighted a horrible event, I think the book certainly serves a purpose. The book involves two stories intertwined, one about Sarah a young Jewish girl who was caught up in the Vel' d'Hiv and a contemporaty Julia who is trying to figure out all that happenned. The connection between the two is an apartment in Paris that harbors a terrible secret. I found the story told in Sarah's voice much more compelling and interesting than the one told in Julia's. Julia's story was sort of like The Guiding Light. One of the blurbs on the jacket said that the reader would not forget the story.  I agree. It is a very moving story. However, I was disappointed in the ending after such powerful writing in the body of the book about both Sarah and Julia. Now I'll go read the other reviews to see what other readers thought.

0307269981|5.0|I found this second book, even better than the first which says a lot as I described the first book as spellbinding. The Girl who Played with Fire held my interest from start to finish as it was such a powerful and engrossing story. I find these books very hard to review so bear with me as I don't want to give away the storyline or any spoilers. To me, this is the kind of series that you need to dive into and not know what comes ahead.<br /><br />My favorite storyline and character from The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo was Lisbeth a twenty-something pierced and tattooed young woman with a horrible past full of secrets. She is intriguing and mysterious and her mind works at a genius level including her computer hacking abilities. In this book, Lisbeth is the focus and the heart of the story as you finally learn much more about her childhood, her family and what her life was like growing up. Her story is haunting and it's amazing that one can survive through such trauma in one lifetime. Mikael a political and financial journalist who runs and co-owns a magazine called Millenium is now tracking a story that exposes the sex trade industry in Sweden. He discovers ties to members of Swedish society, business and even government. When he is closer to exposing this, murder and mystery ensue. Lisbeth is linked to the murders and Mikael is the only one who believes in her innocence. Lisbeth is drawn into this through her own curiosity and hacking skills once again and she is finally forced to confront details from her past.<br /><br />There are definitely disturbing parts to this book as in The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo that are graphic and violent in nature so be forewarned if this is something that bothers you. The storyline was so amazing and intelligent that these dark aspects didn't destroy my opinion of the book. As in the first book, there was a lot of violence towards women and it seems excessive. The author tends to focus on human interest stories in which women are dealt with in underhanded and evil ways. I believe that his intent was to bring attention to this issue of the sex trade/trafficking issue as it is a global one.<br /><br />The Girl who Kicked the Hornet's Nest is the third and final book in the Millenium trilogy. It is to be released in paperback in the U.S. at the end of October but it is unclear as to its availability.

I believe that his intent was to bring attention to this issue of the sex trade/trafficking issue as it is a global one.       The Girl who Kicked the Hornet's Nest is the third and final book in the Millenium trilogy. It is to be released in paperback in the U.S. at the end of October but it is unclear as to its availability. I am very anxious to read this final book in the trilogy even though I hate to see it end.
0439023491|5.0|BUY THIS BOOK (Don't wait in line at the library) because it will sneak up and grab you. It started a little slowly, but before I knew it, I was fully engaged in the story, reading as fast as I could, but not wanting to miss anything.  Ended up staying up half the night and finished it in one sitting.  Now I'll be on pins and needles waiting for the third one.
0545123267|3.0|To sum it up, this book should have been called \\"Twilight: Team Jacob Version.\\" Why? Well, while I understand that the author wrote her first draft of \\"Shiver\\" before \\"Twilight\\" came out, still, the similarities are striking. A boring girl whose only personality traits are obsessing about her supernatural boyfriend, doing homework and cooking dinner for her parents - check; an emo supernatural boyfriend whose life revolves around his human flame, who plays an instrument and writes songs for his girl - check; a boy and a girl sleeping in the same bed night after night and no matter how much this girl asks for \\"it,\\" the hero says \\"no,\\" because it's not \\"right\\" - check; parents, who are oblivious to the fact the their daughter practically has a live-in boyfriend - check. I can go on, but I am sure you get the picture.<br /><br />Why 3 stars and not less then? Well, the writing is not bad. It is a little \\"purplish,\\" but at least we are spared numerous \\"chagrins\\" and endless \\"Edward is a beautiful god-like creature\\" rants. I have to note here however, that although the writing and author's vocabulary are much better than Stephenie Meyer's, this book lacks that signature Twilight addictive quality (I can't believe I just wrote this because I am not even a Twilight fan!), the middle of the book is especially slow moving. The werewolf mythology, although very little explored, is based on a moderately novel idea of the transformation caused by the change in temperature. And finally, the main scorer is that Stiefvater manages to create in her book an atmosphere of coldness. You literally feel cold reading this book all the time. I have to give her some credit for this, I am sure it takes some skill.<br /><br />Overall, it is an OK romance paranormal story (emphasis on the \\"romance\\"). I expect if you love \\"Twilight,\\" you'll like this book too. I personally didn't care for it much. There are 2 more books in this series, but I doubt I'll be reading them.
B001QWBM62|5.0|Summary:  5 out of 5    This type of product tends to be bought by professional sound recordists, which I am not. Therefore I thought it might be of some interest for someone to read a point of view of an amateur's.    Evaluation    The H4n is a uniquely brilliant design, which manages to deliver sophistication and versatility whilst being easy to use, plus quality and portability that is exceptional. The sound quality of the on board mics is nothing short of brilliant and the fact that you can augment them with studio quality XLR or 1/4\\" connected mics which might need 48V phantom power, without the need for additional mixers, makes this a product of choice for the mobile user.  The large and clear screen and good button layout means it is easy to use in dim environments.  With full 24 bit recording and great mics, it is a delight in sound quality. I applaud Zoom for providing a great Auto Level  Record mode, which means that for non-critical situations, I can just hit Record and go, while at the same time this instrument can be used in demanding situations that require manual settings.    The ability of 4 track recording is brilliant. With 2x external mics plus the 2x on-board ones you can make a professional recording with little effort. The STAMINA mode almost double battery life to 11 hrs of recording (only in WAV format), which is great for field use.     I recommend the H4n coupled with a 16GB, or at minimum an 8GB SDHC memory card and some Eneloope rechargeable batteries. I also recommend getting the wired remote, for serious users.    My background    I am an IT professional and recently I had to record the audio of a conference so that I could put MP3 audio on the organisation's web site. For this I used a Behringer mixer I bought off eBay, a wireless mic we borrowed from church, a high quality but inexpensive condenser mic with XLR connection and a Vosonic portable HD media player to record the audio. It worked perfectly but was a bit cumbersome to carryall the bits.    After the conference, I visited my 84yr old uncle who has a Steinway piano worth over $100k and is an exceptional pianist and I offered to record him playing. This was such a success that we started looking at an integrated and simple to use device for him, so that he can record and then listen to, his piano playing, and one that can capture the tone of his piano. This started my investigation into portable digital recorders.    After about 8 hr's of research on the web I decided on a Zoom H2 as a cost effective product and bought one locally. It is a fine tool, but is a bit fiddly to use and has a very small screen which for the elderly, is a hindrance, and the audio is good but not stellar. Further research and listening to other people's recordings on the web had made me think that the H4n would be a better choice. I exchanged the H2 at the shop and bought two H4n's (one for myself and one for my uncle).    The H4n delivers on every front. Quality, build, ease of use and versatility. I am delighted and can recommend it without reservations.
B001MW0J2O|3.0|first things last: i took a chance on this album.  i'm usually more into guitar driven rock,  like old Cheap Trick and Aerosmith.  but i read some startling reviews of this record, with  comparisons to Pet Sounds and wilco - so i figured i'd give it a shot.  while there are some  good tunes (\\"Also Frightened\\" and \\"Bluish\\" stand out), this is not a five-star brilliant record.  a little too self congratulatory for me.  sorry...
0385504225|3.0|I had great expectations for this book but was sadly left pretty disappointed.  I'm a big fan of Angels & Demons and liked The Da Vinci Code but The Lost Symbol just left me wishing Dan Brown had retired Langdon's character before.<br /><br />The book started off a little slow for my liking. I didn't really get into it til around Chapter 30.<br /><br />My major issue with the book is it felt like it was going to go on forever.  The only real shocking part (which i use loosely) came around Chapter 120, yet the book continues for another 13 chapters.  Come on, end it already.<br /><br />I think if this had been the first of the Robert Langdon books I would have been ok with it but it just really didn't have the same page turning thrill Brown's previous works have.
B0010VD7EO|4.0|you wouldn't think MGMT would be my kinda thing: i'm more into guitar driven rock like  old Cheap Trick and Aerosmith.  but Oracular Spectacular is just too damn catchy to deny.  \\"Time to Pretend\\" is one of the best songs of the decade: complete with a \\"Baba O'Reilly\\"  beat, and \\"Pieces of What\\" sounds like Johnny Thunders.  how cool is that?
B002KDUDG6|3.0|I know it may be harsh to give Michael Buble an average rating because he is an incredible artist with a classic voice, but I was kind of disappointed in this cd.  I was looking forward to getting it, and I listened to every song immediately.  I have to say they all sounded the same to me.  For some fans this may be fine to not change up anything in his game-but I'm sorry-I need more.  He needs some updating.
B0025KVLTC|5.0|If born after 1975, it is hard to understand the importance of  the Beatles; unless you know a lot about music. Rock is so Beatles-derivative, even in the most obscure ways, if you were not there, the Beatles sound like everyone else. Actually, everyone else takes sound from the Beatles. It is just that as more time passes, fewer realize it.<br /><br />Does your song go beyond I IV V? Listen to Paul's \\"For No One.\\" Do you like creepy little giggles or stuido diolouge to segue tracks. Listen to the 1-2-3-4-1-2 before \\"Taxman.\\" Have a sitar: that is \\"Love To You.\\" And if I have to explain the impact of \\"Tommorrow Never Knows,\\" I am spoonfeeding Revolver Gerber Bananas.<br /><br />To REALLY get it, you have to go to pre-Beatles rock: dance music or crooning. Here were these four young guys-kids, really--sitting in the studio, saying \\"What if we try an oboe?  Why not do that? What happens if we run the tape backwords, what would that sound like? That alright, Mr Martan?  Sure! We can do that.\\"<br /><br />Paul takes his finger and slides from fret to fret instead of picking his finger up, and turn around, the electric bass is a new instrument.<br />The four \\"kids\\" had no musical training but had a much more powerful weapon: curiosity. No cats were killed, but just LISTEN to what did happen. Is something otherworldly going on? If I thought that way, I'd swear to it.<br /><br />The Beatles may not have realized, but they tied the rope that now links rock to the rest of music. They may have just been \\"just\\" tosing ideas, but they took rock and changed it from a blues or easy listening idiom to the most comprehensive music ever. They brought music to rock, and made rock, music.<br /><br />The next time someone second gueeses, says the Gods are overrated, play them some  Frankie Avolon, play some Jerry Lee Lewis.<br /><br />Then revolve THIS.

B0025KVLUQ|5.0|The Beatles may have had many good reasons to break up, but it sure was not the music.<br /><br />Abbey Road shows they were still growing by leaps and bounds. \\"Come Together\\" has John's best lyrics, Paul's best bass playing, and Ringo's best drumming. \\"Something\\" is probably the best love song in rock. \\"I Want You\\" shows the Beatles could have won toe to toe with Yes, King Crimson, or any of the new, progressive bands of 1969. Side two shows the band's ability to make sweeping music out of the most straightforward of songs, and even diddy's like \\"Maxwell's Silver Hammer\\" have playing that no band could top.<br /><br />Recording technology and production values were improving in 1969. Paul's bass on \\"Come Together\\" invented the sliding smoothness 1970s sessionmen like Tony Levin used as rock became more professional. The band's musicianship grew more by the month than most grew in five years.<br /><br />Had there been a Beatles 1971 and beyond, there would have been no limits.<br /><br />Oh, I forgot, yesterday. Happy birthday, John.
B002KLAL4W|4.0|There have been several things bouncing around in my head as I listened to every Pearl Jam album chronologically leading up to \\"Backspacer\\". The first thing I felt was that Pearl Jam is like Led Zeppelin, they both don't make bad albums as a whole. There can be average songs on every album, but each album holds its own extremely well over time. The next thing is song craft. Pearl Jam have a knack for making good music, period. They are one of only a few bands that are not precious, pretentious or pretty. They've managed to march on for almost twenty years now with a minimum of drama and histrionics. They are a solid rock band, an American rock band.<br /><br />\\"Backspacer\\" finds them continuing on from the re-birth of 2006's \\"Pearl Jam\\". More rock and roll, more hooks, more introspective lyrics. The hooks are particularly strong here, making this dangerously close to a 'pop rock' album that fans might feel a little disgruntled about. The band rocks hard with the first two tracks \\"Gonna See My Friend\\" and \\"Got Some\\", followed up with the first single \\"The Fixer\\", which is well done. Things get a little bland with \\"Johnny Guitar\\", but that is more than made up for with the excellent acoustic ballad \\"Just Breathe\\" which should be their next single. \\"Amongst The Waves\\" is standard Pearl Jam fare.<br /><br />\\"Unthought Known\\" is good, as is the punked out \\"Supersonic\\". \\"Speed Of Sound\\" and \\"Force Of Nature\\" are a little stale, and \\"The End\\" finishes the album decently. Four stars.<br /><br />Here's how \\"Backspacer\\" compares to the rest of the Pearl Jam catalog:<br /><br />1991 Ten: Four Stars<br />1993 Vs.: Four Stars<br />1994 Vitalogy: Four Stars<br />1996 No Code: Four Stars<br />1998 Yield: Three and a Half Stars<br />2000 Binaural: Four Stars<br />2002 Riot Act: Three and a Half Stars<br />2006 Pearl Jam: Four Stars<br />2009 Backspacer: Four Stars

B002PEP4U0|5.0|The remarkable story of a remarkable boy, William Kamkwamba, who with his family, lived in abject poverty and miraculously survived a famine in landlocked and neglected Malawi, Africa.     The story of how this brilliant and majestic, self-taught 14-year-old boy harnessed the wind is, of course. inspiring. Still, the most moving part of the book to me was the story of the famine that the people of Malawi suffered through a devastating famine, how that famine came upon them and engulfed them, and how their government denied that a famine even existed.     Read this incredible story and it will stay with you and impact how you look at life, people and yourself for a very long time.
B002NXSRVG|1.0|\\"Weaponize the warheads.\\"  That's all you need to know about this film.  At least three separate characters say this at least three separate times throughout the movie.  \\"Weaponize the warheads.\\"  And how do they accomplish this?  By sticking them under a particle accelerator that happens to be owned by a billionaire French baron.  I'm no nuclear physicist, nor am I an arms and ballistics expert but \\"warheads,\\" by their very nature of being warheads, are, at all times, \\"weaponized.\\" Otherwise, they are \\"paperweights.\\"  Even Michael Bay wouldn't be so ridiculous as to put in a scene where someone is particle-accelerating a paperweight to advance their twisted desire for world-domination.<br /><br />I'm sure that if one were covered from head to toe in black leather, such a statement would have a more profound, unsettling effect on the intended audience.  Think about it - you're a billionaire in charge of an atom smasher.  You're kicking it in your lab, accelerating the hell out of everything you can get your hands on, all in the name of science, when a mob of leather-wearing miscreants bursts through your door.  They whip out an imposing-looking case, point a gun at your head, and tell you to \\"weaponize\\" the contents, which are clearly leftover props from the Nick Cage movie, \\"The Rock.\\" Are you going to give them a lengthy speech in an obnoxious accent about how warheads stuffed with nanomachines are just going to melt if you stick them in the microwave?  Or worse, point out just how redundant their command is?<br /><br />Think of it this way - it's like cracking three eggs, adding them to a heated skillet with cheese and sausage, letting them cook for ten minutes, sliding the finished concoction onto a plate, then handing it to someone and saying, \\"Breakfastize the omelette.\\"  Try it the next time you're at a diner - dress up like a comic-con attendee, order up some flapjacks and grits, and as soon as the waitress delivers it to your table, look her in the eye, and in your best Scottish accent, tell her to \\"Breakfastize\\" it.<br /><br />Then, for the next hour, attempt to make the ice in your water glass sink to the bottom and crush the table beneath.

B001GM28HO|3.0|Ha! Well, I admit that I ignored Lady GaGa until this month but figured I'd see what all the fuss was about and gave The Fame a thorough listen.<br /><br />To start, I'd like to say that she is actually a solid musical talent. She plays piano and writes her own music which for a Pop act is very rare.<br />I also watched a few of her performances and was impressed that she did not lip-sync even though it sacrificed her singing quality at times. But hey, doing acrobatic choreography and singing at the same time is not easy at all. It's actually very hard to do and I admire any artist who can manage that without panting and losing their breath entirely.<br /><br />The songs on this album are a mix of Hits and misses.<br />Pokerface and Paparazzi stand out as my favorites.  These two tracks have a good foundation of analog sounding Synthesizers and very well executed progressions and choruses.<br />However, there are some real stinkers on here. One of them in particular is 'Ech, Ech (Nothing Else I Can Say)'.  This track sucks and remind me too much of Menudo, The Jets or New Kids on the Block for me to stomach. Perhaps it's ironic. But still, being a listener of Classical Music I find that when irony sacrifices composition and expression it completely misses the point. Instead of phrasing an ironic structure or sound, producing an entire piece around an ironic concept diminishes the overall value of it.<br /><br />My hope for this artist is that she progresses and develops her music and lyrical writing more and that 'The Fame' is written based on a concept and not her soulful expression and ideas. Pop has a way of going stale and entrapping artists in a particular style or sound. A fate which Lady GaGa may be facing if she doesn't push herself beyond this sound. If she is intent on staying \\"FAMOUS\\" or whatever, she has two options, kick it up several notches or keep cranking out Discopop Dance Songs. I hope she chooses the first option and faces her career with guts instead of doing what her new Pop contemporaries have been doing for the past decade and selling the same product over and over with increased PR in order to keep market value up.<br /><br />Her style... Yes, there is allot of fuss about it, rightfully so! It's impressive and I am confident that if anything, her style will continue to change with each album she records.  David Bowie being one of her primary influences will likely ensure that.<br /><br />In summery, this album is a good first start and hopefully not the best she can do.<br /><br />My advice to Miss GaGa is stay away from drugs and keep your focus on your music and develop your skills as a Musician.<br />I'd hate to see you go down in a blaze of glitter and flash bulbs before you truly have the chance to change the landscape of Popular Music.emporaries have been doing for the past decade and selling the same product over and over with increased PR in order to keep market value up.

B000001GQQ|5.0|Martha Argerich once said in an interview that Prokofiev must have liked her; she described her uncommonly effortless way with his Third Concerto as though she never really had to practice much to learn it--it sort of came to her naturally.<br /><br />It is hardly surprising that Argerich's 1967 debut concerto recording featured the Prokofiev Third, coupled with what soon became another signature concerto of hers, the Ravel G Major. Since then, she has played these two concertos innumerable times around the world as well as recorded both of them twice. As a matter of fact, both of them were programmed for this year's Proms season, although only the Ravel materialised.<br /><br />Apparently, Argerich's approach to these works has essentially been consistent over the years. As for the Ravel, her second recorded version was caught by DG in 1987 ([[ASIN:B000001G9Q Ravel: Piano Concertos]]); in the summer of 2002, I had the consummate pleasure of hearing her live at the Proms, with the Gustav Mahler Jugendorchester under Abbado. It took until 1997 before her second recorded version of the Prokofiev was made by EMI ([[ASIN:B00000C2J8 Prokofiev: Piano Concertos Nos. 1 & 3 / Bartok: Piano Concerto No. 3]]); there are at least three versions available on YouTube--two with the RAI Orchestra (alas, not a great orchestra) under Eliahu Inbal (1998) and Tugan Sokhiev (2008), respectively, and one with the Toronto Symphony Orchestra under Andrew Davis from 2002 (an absolutely stunning performance, where the audience goes wild already after the first movement!).<br /><br />My accompanying review of the 1997 remake of the Prokofiev Third describes the 'Argerich' approach in detail, which largely fits the Ravel as well--an unmatched combination of impetus, brilliance and sense of discovery, where every twist and turn sounds as much a matter of course as invented on the spot, with pacing as impeccably swift as entirely unrushed, and where her ubiquitous fire and abandon seems a force of nature rather than the result of human deliberation.<br /><br />Argerich's studio 1975 Gaspard is overall impressive, especially in Scarbo. Her volatile dexterity can be taken for granted, although it is mostly kept in control here--as opposed to the totally feral 1978 live account from the Concertgebouw, where things do go overboard (most notably the climax of Ondine--[[ASIN:B000055WFF Martha Argerich: Live from the Concertgebouw 1978 & 1979 - Schumann, Ravel / Argerich]]). Nonetheless, neither of her accounts is quite able to match the refined, demonic thrills conjured up in Pogorelich's 1981 reference performance.<br /><br />DG's sound is decent for the time, if somewhat two-dimensional. Even though Argerich at least challenged herself in the 1997 Prokofiev remake, and Zimerman delivered the piano part of the Ravel with a higher degree of sophistication in 1994 DG reference sound ([[ASIN:B000009MF7 Ravel: The Piano Concertos; Valses nobles et sentimentales]]), I cannot see this disc being surpassed in the foreseeable future.<br /><br />TIMINGS: Prokofiev Third--8:58, 9:01, 9:00; Ravel G Major--8:08, 9:03, 3:52; Ravel Gaspard--6:19, 6:41, 9:20<br /><br />REFERENCES: Both Concertos--This One; Gaspard--Pogorelich ([[ASIN:B00006L76R Chopin: Piano Sonata No.2; Ravel: Gaspard De La Nuit; Prokoviev: Piano Sonata no. 6 [Germany]]])e result of human deliberation.

B000002IOJ|5.0|To me this is one of the most accessible, perhaps almost commercial thrash albums there is...in '89 perhaps it was, not sure but it was supposed to bring them into the group of Metallica/Megadeth/Anthrax league, and to me bands like Testament, Overkill, even Exodus deserved more respect but seemed to just fall short.    The overall feel of this album is very bright and straightforward for the most part, I love the bass sound of this CD...at high volume it can almost have a very live feel to it...very in your face, but at the same time the songs are interesting and catchy enough so as to hold your attention for song after song. Each song has it's own feel to so it's not just thrash after thrash song, it changes speeds and there are differnet tones thrown in, it's just a really interesting album to listen to for me anyway.     Favs include just about everything I love \\"Perilous Nation\\", \\"Envy Life\\", and of course the title track. \\"Sins Of Ommision\\" is probably the best of the bunch also. They do a ballad called \\"The Ballad\\" that is right up there with any Metallica ballad IMO also. Lot of great guitar work on here too of course which Testament is known for, a ballad, and some somewhat social and environmental issues that are kept on the light side, but represent the full force of this classic release.

B00275EHCI|3.0|Simply put, this film is a showcase for Bruce Willis in a completely unoriginal concept.  With parallels to more previous film and literature than worth mentioning...nevermind, here's a few: [[ASIN:B001I98XAQ Snow Crash]], [[ASIN:B0012GVKVY I, Robot]], [[ASIN:B000P0J0AQ The Matrix]], and an Arnold triple-dip in [[ASIN:B000056PMU The 6th Day]], [[ASIN:B00070FX5U Total Recall]], and, of course, [[ASIN:B000OPOAM0 The Terminator]].  Suffice to say, the concept of living through alternate means or gaining experiences without sacrifice or danger, having a secondary persona without repercussions, or the simple concept of robot sentience, has been explored ad nauseum.  Director Jonathan Mostow just adds to the nausea.<br /><br />A corporation named VSI has become nearly globally dominant by creating \\"Surrogates,\\" realistic robots through which people can plug into the life they desire, without any reservations or hesitations, from the comfort of their own home.  Designed by world-renowned scientist Dr. Lionel Carter (James Cromwell) - who has been removed from VSI's board of directors in recent years - the Surrogates ubiquitously carry out every day life via the thoughts of their virtually moribund humans.  When a new weapon is developed, one that can kill a dormant human via the connection to their Surrogate, FBI Agent Greer (Bruce Willis) and Agent Peters (Radha Mitchell) are on the case - via their Surrogates, of course.  After some investigation and futuristic police work reminiscent of [[ASIN:B000PC6XDQ Minority Report]], the clues not only lead to sinister links between the influential in the government, military, and politics, but also to the \\"Prophet\\" (Ving Rhames) led, ghetto-locked resistance movements throughout the country, those who view Surrogates as an abomination and affront to the beauty and reality of humankind.<br /><br />The lesson(s) of this movie could be taken in many ways.  Some will view this as a religious parable, where humans have encroached upon the boundaries of God's creation and must be purged of their wickedness.  Others may see it as a message of virtual prison, or even a subtle jab at slavery, where the controllers eventually lose dominance over others or their own reality, and eventually become the controlled.  Alternately, however, I view this as a cautionary humanistic tale, one that warns of an ever-increasing disconnect between people, where virtual reality supersedes life.  Human interactivity is at an all time low.  We don't know our neighbors; we order food via cell-phone; we prefer autopay options wherever available versus actually talking to someone.  Perhaps the relationship scarcity will lead towards this reality; after all, isn't every hot woman online actually a naked fat guy sitting in his basement, mouse in one hand, bag of Cheetos in another?of God's creation and must be purged of their wickedness.

Brown views the power of design \\"not as a link in a chain but as the hub of a wheel\\"...not as a stage in a process but as a center of gravity, as a gravitational/centrifugal force, with involvement at all levels and in all areas of operation. \\"Design is now too important to be left to designers.\\"<br /><br />Brown carefully organizes his material with two Parts. First, he introduces a set of principles for design thinking that be applied by almost anyone in any organization, whatever its size and nature may be. He involves his reader in a journey through the important stages of thinking. He provides a framework that he hopes will help the reader identify the principles and practices that make for great design thinking. He focuses on design thinking as applied to business and examines a number of the most innovative companies in the world, such as his own firm, IDEO, as well as Bank of America, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Google, Intel, Kaiser Permanente, Mattel, Mayo Clinic, Pixar, Procter & Gamble, and Shimano. Each of these companies has established a culture within which there is a constant generation of ideas. After rigorous evaluation according to criteria that are most appropriate for the given context, and frame-of-reference, the focus of most promising ideas shifts from problem to project. This requires articulation of a clear goal at the outset.  Design thinking \\"creates natural deadlines that impose discipline and [provide] an opportunity to review progress, make midcourse corrections, and redirect future activity. The clarity, direction, and limits of a well-defined project are vital to sustaining a high level of creative energy.\\"<br /><br />Where to begin a project? Brown recommends first formulating the brief that can allow for serendipity, unpredictability, and \\"the capricious whims of fate,\\" then assembling the project team, selecting those who have multidisciplinary capabilities, are not risk averse, are what Roger Martin characterizes as \\"integrative thinkers,\\" welcome collaboration, and thrive on challenges.  The importance of design thinking to this process cannot be exaggerated. It starts with divergence, expanding the range of options rather than limit them; it balances the perspectives of users and is what I could call \\"beneficiary-centric\\"; helps to accelerate time to first prototype (a subject to which Brown devotes a great deal of attention, notably on Pages 87-108); \\"shares the inspiration\\" within internal knowledge networks; accommodates the reality that there are no silver bullets for innovation, only \\"silver buckshot\\"; allocate resources to accommodate fast-paced, unruly, and disruptive innovation initiatives;  and enables creative innovators \\"to bridge the chasm between thinking and doing because they [are] passionately committed to the [common] goal of a better life and a better world around them.\\"<br /><br />Here in Dallas, we have a Farmer's Market near the downtown area at which several vendors offer slices of fresh fruit so that people can sample for taste. In that spirit, here are two brief excerpts from Brown's lively and eloquent narrative:<br /><br />On an approach to innovation that consists of a \\"judicious blend\\" of bottom-up experimentation and guidance from above: \\"The rules for this approach are as simple to state as they are challenging to apply:<br /><br />1. The best ideas emerge when the whole organizational ecosystem - not just its designers and engineers and certainly not just management has room to experiment.<br /><br />[Note: In 1924, William L. McKnight, then CEO of 3M observed, \\"If you put fences around people, you get sheep. Give people the room they need.\\" That is especially true of those who participate in brainstorming sessions. ]<br /><br />2.

0553573411|5.0|Vivid characters and great action.  Intriguing plot, with some fun twists.  But what sets this book above the crowd is, it has some things to say about duty, evil, and love.  How difficult it is to live up to everyone's expectations and also do what is right.  Great job Robin.
B00006I53S|1.0|Either it was damaged in shipping, or I got a defective lens.  For whatever reason, the picture quality on any photo taken on this lens (with every setting, stop, is on/off, tested) came out blurry, particularly on the left side.   Photos taken with my old stock 18-55 lens were dramatically clearer.  The zoom range was decent, but I'm disappointed.  Sending this lens back.  It didn't even come with a manual.  I was really looking forward to a lens upgrade.  ---  Update -  I reordered the same lens from the same folks and, surprise, this one came in a real Canon lens box with manual and everything.  Clearly the one I sent originally was not brand new.  Be advised, if you don't get a manual and a canon box, you're getting sent something that someone else returned.  That said, the new lens is beautiful.  The shots are crisp and even using it for a few pictures, it's pretty awesome and the best lens I have.    If I could, I'd change my rating from 1 star to 4.  For the hassle I went through returning the bad lens, I have to take away a star.

B002IUBFQI|4.0|This is fast becoming a classic to last the ages. Not only are the tracks great musically but the lyrics are so heartfelt and meaningful as well. The tracks flow along very nicely and there are no noticeable fillers or weak tracks here. The sound quality is very good and the bass is killer! However, this mini-lp replica sleeve (mlps) version is not the best one I've seen as it consists of very thin cardboared assembled poorly looking like it will come apart once the glue gets old.  There are 3 bonus tracks on this Japanese release though as \\"Ex-Factor (Remix)\\" is added to the other 2 extras: \\"Tell Him (Live)\\" and \\"Can't Take My Eyes Off Of You\\" the Frankie Valli cover.  Also included are two inner sleeve jackets and a 32-page booklet containing all the lyrics in both English and Japanese.  A very good hip-hop/r&b album which is destined to outlast the others over time and become a classic and like a true classic, I find myself enjoying this album more and more every time I listen to it.  It certainly grows on you as any classic album would.  Highly recommended although you may want to get the cheaper version which probably sounds just as good unless you really need the poorly designed mlps cardboard sleeve and the extra track which I kinda doubt that you do.

The astonishing \\"Exogenesis\\" tracks are worth the price of admission alone, as well as the driven \\"Unatural Selection.\\"  People who prefer the early harder-rocking tracks such as \\"Hysteria\\" might not like this slower-paced CD as much, but for fans who enjoy Matt Bellamy's vocals, complex compositions and extraterrestrial themes, this CD has it all.

I tell you now that it rocked harder than any other time I've heard it. It ripped, it slid, it sweetened, it thumped with such clarity, such a tone that you'd think I had my speakers replaced. It was Abbey Road all over again. I swear, go crank this on your best system and don't tell me Georgie Boy's guitar does not sparkle like never before on \\"Something\\". Tell me with a straight face that instrumental break between 'Pam' and 'Bathroom' does not put you into orbit.

0143039601|3.0|Some of the general points made below have been used in other reviews of books and materials by and about Jack Kerouac.    \\"As I have explained in another entry in this space in a DVD review of the film documentary \\"The Life And Times Of Allen Ginsberg\\", recently I have been in a \\"beat\\" generation literary frame of mind. I think it helps to set the mood for commenting on one of Jack Kerouac's major works, \\"The Dharma Bums\\", a novel that explores his and his `beat\\" companions fascination, at least part time fascination, with the Buddhist lifestyle and philosophy in his well known spontaneous writing method at a time when he was trying to keep body and soul together, that it all started last summer when I happened to be in Lowell, Massachusetts on some personal business. Although I have had more than a few old time connections with that now worn out mill town I had not been there for some time. While walking in the downtown area I found myself crossing a small park adjacent to the site of a well-known mill museum and restored textile factory space. Needless to say, at least for any reader with a sense of literary history, at that park I found some very interesting memorial stones inscribed with excerpts from a number of Kerouac's  better known works dedicated to Lowell's `bad boy', the \\"king of the 1950s beat writers\\".     And, just as naturally, when one thinks of Kerouac then, \\"On The Road\\", his classic modern physical and literary `search' for the meaning of America for his generation which came of age in post-World War II , readily comes to mind. No so well known, however, is the fact that that famous youthful novel was merely part of a much grander project, an essentially autobiographical exposition by Kerouac in many volumes starting from his birth in 1922, to chart and vividly describe his relationship to the events, great and small, of his times. Those volumes bear the general title \\"The Legend Of Duluoz\\".  That is why we today, in the year of the forty anniversary of Kerouac's death, are under the sign of his book of essays \\"The Dharma Bums\\".    In a sense, as Kerouac himself often admitted, his fascination with Buddhism was something of an extension of his Gallic-etched Catholicism. That makes sense in that both religious expressions are filled with ritual and intense mystery. Thus, when Jack went west in the mid1950s to San Francisco and hooked up with the likes of poet Gary Snyder who was already a serious student of that religion/philosophical outlook it was natural that the restless Kerouac and the others would be attracted to this form of life, although it probably was, in the end, far too rigorous for Kerouac with his many earthy appetites. Nevertheless, this book presents that lifestyle and the youthful search for fulfillment that this searching represented in a very positive light and proved to be helpful to him in getting through some rough patches. Allen Ginsberg, a very close Kerouac friend at the time, became, for a while, a devotee of more substance and notoriety. However, and here we get back to the political realities, when the deal went down that religious philosophy could not hold up against the harsh political choices of the late 1960s when things got very \\"hot\\" in America, and the world.
0385504225|5.0|Although I do agree with some of the negative comments about this book, but they are only of surface values.  Most don't realize the transformative message written in this piece of literature... that we are each a god or goddess only to be realized by ourselves... that all religions are fundamentally united by this message.  If more people in the world understand or BELIEVE in this idea, then this world we live in can truly become a better place.    My personal revelation is this: Eden is whereever we are, whereever people are connected to each other, have respect for each other, whereever we each truly understand ourselves, whereever people realize our relationship toward each other is what makes our world a paradise.
1594202249|2.0|I've read all of Pynchon's novels, his short stories, and his nonfiction.  This is his worst novel. Even Vineland was much more inventive and amusing.  The problem here is that there is little depth.  Who cares if Doc ever gets back with Shasta? The only tension is sexual in an empty sort of way.  Pynchon did a much better job with his depiction of genuine male longing in Mason & Dixon with Mason and Rebecca.  Additionally, the cardboard characters throughout Inherent Vice simply are not as amusing as those in his other novels.  In short, if you want his best, read V. or Mason & Dixon.  His wildest and most inventive: Gravity's Rainbow.  His tightest and most focused: Crying of Lot 49. Easy to read on the sentence level, but longest: Against the Day. Early work: Slow Learner. Trash: Inherent Vice.
B000ICLRHK|5.0|Blu-rays are about picture and sound quality.  A review of Blu-ray edition of an old 1994 movie should be addressing the issue of added entertainment value when upgrading to the Blu-ray edition, not the story itself, which we are all familiar with.<br /><br />A dvd of this movie cost a bomb back in the day.  It has been shown countless times on free to air TV.  I saw this movie in a theatre way back in 1994.  Nostalgia made me buy Blu-rays of this movie along with Blu-ray Black Hawk Down, both at the same price.  Naturally, I saw Black Hawk Down first, reserving Speed for later.<br /><br />I totally underestimated SPEED.  With the Blu-ray, (I hook up my TV to Bose 901 speakers) I was transported back to the cinema hall.  The sound from the Blu-ray was awesome.  Every explosion, collision, aeroplane, helicopter had a deep and tight bass sensurround sound.  The bass on my speakers were truly put to the test.  The deep rumblings of the bus and the sound of the crashing of the bus were true to life.  Sounds were moving to and fro Left and Right speakers positioning the bus, helicopters and gunshots correctly.  This made the Blu-ray worth every cent.  The dialogue was crisp.  I switched off the sub-titles and just enjoyed the whole Blu-ray performance, even though I had seen this movie on Full Screen TV free so many times before.  With Blu-ray, this appeared to be a different movie altogether.<br /><br />I cannot complain about the picture quality, although others might expect a better transfer.  I can see every wrinkle on Dennis Hopper's face and the individual hairs on every actor's head in close-ups.  For a 1994 movie, that is good enough for me.  Colour saturation was good.  The picture quality surpasses that of many Blu-rays which cost a lot more, and which are of more recent vintage.<br /><br />Probably one of the most well spent $12.99 (price at the time of this review).  The Blu-ray release surpasses expectations.  Black Hawk Down has a more sombre theme, but somehow, the gunfire and helicopter crashes sound muted compared to SPEED.  I expected better from Blu-ray Black Hawk Down and for value added by the Blu-ray edition.  Blu-ray Black Hawk Down was better than the dvd, but it did not have the massive improvement Blu-ray brought to SPEED.  The acoustics in SPEED sounded better than the recent Fast and Furious series of Blu-rays, to me anyway.<br /><br />I am not in the position to comment about technical specifications, but for a person who has been disappointed by a lot of Blu-ray upgrades, SPEED added so much more enjoyment for such a small investment.<br /><br />If Blu-rays reviews ignored the content and were rated according to \\"How much more did the Blu-ray edition add to your enjoyment of the movie compared to the dvd version\\", I would say SPEED BD would rank in the top few.  Gladiator Blu-ray, on the other hand, would rank in the bottom few (if you ignored the 5 star contents).<br /><br />And if you do not have a copy of SPEED, go straight for the affordable Blu-ray version of SPEED.  I experienced a ressurection of a movie I once wrote off as \\"old\\".  Excellent value for money.er crashes sound muted compared to SPEED.

1594488878|5.0|I remember plowing through Long Way Down in one evening while on a trip to San Diego.  I actually had the audio version on my iPod, which included a single male narrator doing all the voices, even the women, of a book written in the first person.  But that didn't stop me from loving that book and having a great memory of sitting out watching the ocean while listening to the incredible story with characters I truly missed when the book ended.<br /><br />It's been a few years since, and I never got around to reading Slam.  But I downloaded Juliet Naked on my Kindle for a quick trip to New York.  I can't say I finished it in one day, but pretty damn close.  It took a little longer for the characters to grab me.  In my laymen opinion, the fact that we move into the story so subtlety may be a sign of even better writing.  The story just unfolds at  nice pace.<br /><br />I think what amazes me most if how much Hornby makes me care about his characters, and this is very much the case n Juliet, Naked.  Even the annoying Duncan is exonerated with his \\"you asked us to listen\\" line, which is one my favorites.<br /><br />I am going to say that Long Way Down is still my favorite Hornby book, but Juliet, Naked is #2.  I'm anxious to download Slam and see what I missed there, and of course I look forward to Hornby's next masterpiece.

Like some of the other reviewers for this albums, I too can't stop listening to the album. It just gets better and better each time I listen to it. The real deal closer will be to see them perform live with the new singer. To tell you the truth, the two times I have seen them (original lineup) perform live ('92 Clash of the Titans Tour, and the Third Lollapolooza in '93) Layne had an \\"alright\\" performance but I am sure it was because of his drug addiction. R.I.P. Layne, you are missed dearly and I hope you approve of this new album  just as much as some of us are diggin' on it.
B002S0OBFK|4.0|Remember a few years ago when \\"The Blair Witch Project\\" overcame genre expectations and became a blockbuster cult hit? That film had several other films that were inspired by its \\"Mockumentary\\" style gimmick; \\"Cloverfield\\", \\"[REC]\\" and \\"Quarantine\\" to name a few. Well, writer/director Oren Peli's \\"PARANORMAL ACTIVITY\\" is another film that follows in the footsteps of those films. It premiered in the 2007 Screamfest Festival and at the Slamdance film festival in 2008. Truth be told, I am not a fan of the POV style cinematography but I do believe that anything done with the right execution, right premise and a film like this will work. The Spanish film \\"[REC]\\" had definitely pulled this off and I am happy to report that \\"Paranormal Activity\\" also succeeds in achieving tension, suspense and genuine creepiness.<br /><br />The film centers on a couple named Katie and Micah (Katie Featherston and Micah Sloat respectively) who lives in a large suburban house. The couple is experiencing several unexplained experiences that leads them to shooting themselves with a camera on a tripod while they sleep. Everyday they would review the footage on the camera until they both become convinced that there is something evil going on their home. Not a ghost, but something demonic that wants Katie...<br /><br />The best way to approach \\"Paranormal Activity\\" is with the viewers' expectations lowered. The film is a slow-burning experience since the film appears to be assembled footage collected from a DV camera. As such the film's quality is very low budget when we talk about cinematography but its low-budget quality doesn't exactly work against it since it adds to the film's amateurish atmosphere and style. In the beginning of the film, I almost felt like I was watching an episode of \\"A Haunting\\"; the film follows very familiar ground on documented haunting and possessions. This makes the film a little predictable but director Oren Peli manages to draw his audience into the experience. You see the couple whine, argue and become scared out of their wits as we witness their frightening experiences through the lens of a handheld camera. Blankets are moved, sleepwalking is witnessed through the lens of the handheld camera as the events slowly escalate and become worst. I was pleased to report that the POV style was executed fairly well, it was rough, edgy and never for one minute did it feel polished as a real movie would feel. If Oren Peli's intentions were to generate tension through the emulation of a `reality' then he does succeed in terms of cinematography and his ability to create subtle gaps in the screenplay. It does succeed in its art but it does have its weaknesses. (I will discuss this further)<br /><br />The film does follow the usual signs of haunting and/or leading to possession. \\"Infestation\\"- where an entity wanders around a familiar space while it gains strength. \\"Oppression\\"- when the haunted and their companions experience uneasiness by certain frightening incidents; until it leads to eventual `possession`. I am not making this up, (you may research it yourself) a demonic force gets its strength from fear and negative energy. If you look at the events in steps, they feed off one another. The screenplay does follow these established rules as we see Micah and Katie experience the signs one by one; they hear noise, loud banging, footsteps until the paranormal activities escalate to the events happening more often to the point of seeing shadowy figures and actual contact. Most of the actual haunting happen at 3 am (as a way to mock the hour of Christ's death) until it becomes worst and worst. It is quite an uneasy experience to see one dragged on the floor in a very inhuman fashion, the direction does bring the film into overdrive the longer it went on.<br /><br />The film follows the usual opposing beliefs mechanism in horror movies in its two protagonists. Katie is the one being haunted and the sympathetic one while Micah is the skeptical one. Katie just wants the unexplained phenomena to stop; she knows that she is the reason for the haunting and she is desperate to seek any help. Micah is the cocky boyfriend; with no spiritual beliefs and he insists that the situation is under his control. Horror movies are full of characters like Micah and Oren Peli accomplishes this with this annoying character. The two mess around with Quija boards, mediums, research and experts in demonology, attic exploration, while they search for a solution to this haunting. The film does give answers to the events experienced by Micah and Katie; I thought it was a decent exercise although the answers weren't necessarily new to me.<br /><br />Granted, that \\"Paranormal Activity\\" gets its strength as a sensory experience rather than a dramatic one. For a film like this to succeed, the movie has to appear rough and unpolished; to be accompanied with acting that is just so realistic that the audience can feel invested in the movie despite its low characterization. Well, in this the movie falters a bit; as the acting by Featherston and Sloat are a bit uneven. The amateurish acting somewhat damages any feelings of realism attained by the director. Their performances do appear a little too contrived, and it was so obvious that they were trying very hard to generate their sensations. Much of the film's burden falls on Featherston's performance; and while certain scenes were acceptable and good, some lacked the feeling of genuine emotions. Sloat was also very wooden in his portrayal as Katie's boyfriend, he becomes annoying. The entire cinematic experiences of \\"Paranormal Activity\\" hinges on spending time with the couple to get the viewer invested; their disappointing portrayal of realistic terror hampered the film a little.<br /><br />Thankfully, the bleak atmosphere of the film makes up for the weaknesses of its two leads. The barren, home-video look of the movie assists in encouraging the viewer to buy into the film's main premise.  I enjoyed the sleeping footages and the jolts, it did manage to make some strands of hair on the back of my neck to stand up; although it wasn't really non-stop scares. Of course, the film does get more intense as it went on but I have to say that film may have benefited if it was a tad shorter; this way the direction would made the film a lot tighter and taut.<br /><br />Paramount did market this movie extremely well; playing only at midnight in a limited number of theaters to get the hype going. However, for a film like this to really reach its viewer, the expectations has to be really low. Given with a very small budget of $ 11,000, the filmmakers managed to make use of its interesting premise. An unknown, unseen force after a woman in the safety of her own home promotes incredible helplessness; seen through the lens of a handheld camera, it successfully generates a psychological grip on its audience. The film does have some well-timed scares and scenes were shot in a very simplistic manner that made me very pleased. \\"Paranormal Activity\\" may have its share of flaws but it is a refreshing break from the rehearsed visual effects that has made Hollywood horror films ineffective; the film is a good \\"haunted house\\" full-length feature film.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!

For a film like this to succeed, the movie has to appear rough and unpolished; to be accompanied with acting that is just so realistic that the audience can feel invested in the movie despite its low characterization. Well, in this the movie falters a bit; as the acting by Featherston and Sloat are a bit uneven. The amateurish acting somewhat damages any feelings of realism attained by the director. Their performances do appear a little too contrived, and it was so obvious that they were trying very hard to generate their sensations. Much of the film's burden falls on Featherston's performance; and while certain scenes were acceptable and good, some lacked the feeling of genuine emotions. Sloat was also very wooden in his portrayal as Katie's boyfriend, he becomes annoying. The entire cinematic experiences of \\"Paranormal Activity\\" hinges on spending time with the couple to get the viewer invested; their disappointing portrayal of realistic terror hampered the film a little.     Thankfully, the bleak atmosphere of the film makes up for the weaknesses of its two leads. The barren, home-video look of the movie assists in encouraging the viewer to buy into the film's main premise.  I enjoyed the sleeping footages and the jolts, it did manage to make some strands of hair on the back of my neck to stand up; although it wasn't really non-stop scares. Of course, the film does get more intense as it went on but I have to say that film may have benefited if it was a tad shorter; this way the direction would made the film a lot tighter and taut.     Paramount did market this movie extremely well; playing only at midnight in a limited number of theaters to get the hype going. However, for a film like this to really reach its viewer, the expectations has to be really low. Given with a very small budget of $ 11,000, the filmmakers managed to make use of its interesting premise. An unknown, unseen force after a woman in the safety of her own home promotes incredible helplessness; seen through the lens of a handheld camera, it successfully generates a psychological grip on its audience. The film does have some well-timed scares and scenes were shot in a very simplistic manner that made me very pleased. \\"Paranormal Activity\\" may have its share of flaws but it is a refreshing break from the rehearsed visual effects that has made Hollywood horror films ineffective; the film is a good \\"haunted house\\" full-length feature film.     Highly Recommended! [4- Stars]
6305291446|4.0|Following the original \\"Halloween\\" from director John Carpenter in 1978, this franchise had for all intents and purposes succumbed to the very same pratfalls that have befallen virtually every other horror franchise in existence. What this means is that the series that birthed the very sub-genre it exists within had become nothing more than another lame slasher franchise cranking out useless sequel after sequel, paying little attention to the fact that the stories were fast becoming old and tired.    In 1995, after the sixth film in the series massively disappointed audiences, the future for the franchise no doubt lay in question. Not to mention, the impending twentieth anniversary of the original \\"Halloween\\" loomed on the horizon, and it was looking as if the date would be remembered with little to no fanfare. However, all of that changed in the summer of 1998, when original star Jamie Lee Curtis reprised her role of Laurie Strode for the seventh installment in the series, \\"Halloween H20: 20 Years Later\\".    \\"Halloween H20: 20 Years Later\\" is essentially summed up by the title. Basically, 20 years after the terrible events that victimized Laurie Strode, she continues to live in fear of the possibility that one day her killer brother may finally find her. Living under assumed names, Laurie and her 17-year-old son (Josh Hartnett) are doing their best to keep their dark family secret buried, while carrying on with some semblance of a normal life. However, some secrets are too powerful to be kept hidden forever, and Michael is determined to finish what he started all those years ago.    Over the course of the 17 year gap that separates \\"Halloween 2\\" and \\"Halloween H20\\" there was numerous other installments released as a part of the franchise. With the release of \\"H20\\" all of the sequels beyond the second movie have been omitted from the series' accepted continuity. For those who are curious, the reason is that movies 3 through 6 did not feature Jamie Lee Curtis or hercharacter Laurie Strode; instead, the focus shifted to Laurie's orphaned daughter (apparently Laurie died in a car wreck or something like that) who is now being hunted by her dear old Uncle Michael. Even though some plot threads from those previous films were somewhat promising; in the end, it was easier to disregard them for the story in \\"H20\\" rather than to rewrite some of the history. While all of this was not incredibly important, I did feel that some exposition was needed for those who may not be aware of why the plots from movies 3 through 6 are never even touched upon, and in fact, most are contradicted by events in \\"Halloween H20\\". Anyways, that's a basic rundown on the history of the \\"Halloween\\" franchise.    If you ever watched any of the previous sequels, then you undoubtedly noticed that the quality of writing took a serious nose-dive from where the series began (which in itself wasn't exactly brilliant from start to finish). Along with the massive slate cleaning that \\"H20\\" brought to the series, the writing for this sequel was much stronger than all of the previous installments thanks to screenwriters Robert Zappia (\\"Five Days to Midnight\\") and Matt Greenberg (\\"Reign of Fire\\"), along with some re-writes by Kevin Williamson (\\"Scream\\").    The overall plot for the film is relatively solid, albeit with a few head scratching moments as most horror movies tend to have, but more on that later. The story took a mature approach to the ramifications of that horrific Halloween night and how even after all this time Laurie still lives in fear of her brother's possible return. Even though at first glance the premise that Michael has supposedly been waiting all this time to come after his sister once again seems a bit far-fetched; the manner in which that plot point was handled was surprisingly effective. I also appreciated the attempt to bring a potential resolution to the conflict set up so long ago between Laurie and Michael. If for no other reason, that portionof the story alone is worth watching for longtime fans of the original who have always wanted to see brother and sister come face-to-face once more.    It has become quite clear that the success of horror hits such as \\"Scream\\" or \\"I Know What You Did Last Summer\\" made an impact on the characters' interactions in this film and almost any other horror films that have followed them. The banter, especially between the teenagers, is fast-paced and loaded with innuendo and pop culture references (as are most teenage conversations). I also noticed that when the adult characters were on the screen the slick, fairly well-written dialogue didn't just disappear or become stale, as is so often the case; instead, it matured (without being too heavy-handed) to tackle the bigger issues that the adult characters, most notably Laurie, were facing throughout the movie.    Now, as I alluded to a moment ago, there were some weak spots in the story though. The biggest weakness this film had was with some of the characters. It seems that ever since \\"Halloween\\" started this sub-genre of horror that every other film of this kind must feature the same basic cast of characters in some form or another. You've got the rebellious guy, the smart girl, and the horny guy and his female equal, and so on and so forth. While this cast is smaller than many other horror films, it still fills most of the roles with standard stock characters. The only difference here is that in the case of Josh Hartnett and Michelle Williams, they actually appeared to be trying to bring some depth and realism to their characters; thus, serving to elevate their status above all the others in the pantheon of unoriginal character archetypes in horror films. But beyond those two, the rest of the teenaged characters were typical carbon copies left over from previous horror movies.    Another couple of issues with this film revolved around the improbability of how Michael either knows to be in certain places to kill someone or somehow catches up to a person running, despite the fact that he's walking as slowly and methodically as possible. Those two faults are not exclusive to this series rather they are common issues in almost every single horror franchise in existence. It does not matter what horror franchise you look at, this is a problem area that is universal and has always irritated me. What I want to know is, \\"Why most directors choose to go along with this obvious absurdity?\\" And lastly, the pacing early on in the story was a little on the slow side. I enjoyed the opening moments of the film that served as a set-up for the remainder of the movie, but the 15 to 20 minutes that followed struggled to keep things going strong. Note to the writers of horror films, the key is to always keep the audience on edge, it worked for John Carpenter in 1978, and I'm willing to bet it still does even now.    As for the performances in this movie, let us begin by discussing the return of Jamie Lee Curtis to the role that made her into a household name. Jamie's performance as Laurie is much more mature and refined here than it was in the original film, and let's just forget about the colossal waste of time that summed up her appearance in the initial sequel. Jamie skillfully portrays the radical change in her character from a woman who continues to be victimized by her memories to a woman ready for a final showdown with her tormentor. From the quieter moments between mother and son, to her soul-bearing confession as to who she really is, to her inevitable moment of truth; Jamie Lee excels in every respect and the movie definitely benefits from her terrific return to the series.    In the supporting roles are mostly up-and-coming talents, although some of these talents are obviously stronger than others. Leading the way for the supporting cast members, as I noted earlier, are Josh Hartnett (\\"Pearl Harbor\\") and Michelle Williams (\\"Brokeback Mountain\\"). Both appeared to be committed to their roles,not willing to sit idly by and just speak the lines and hit their marks in as uninspired a fashion as possible; instead, they opted to let their characters emotions and motivations shine through naturally. Plus, their characters' onscreen chemistry seemed more genuine than most in horror franchises, resulting in their romantic relationship becoming more believable than one would expect.    Next, we have LL Cool J (TV's \\"NCIS: Los Angeles\\") as a mediocre security guard with lofty aspirations. LL has proven in several other projects since his role in this movie that he clearly has acting talent; however, in this role he is merely average. At times his portrayal seemed a little shaky as if he couldn't quite get a handle on the character; however, this problem could be more a fault of the script than the actor in the role. Still, despite a potentially weak character arc, LL should have been able to do more with the role; instead, he seemed to rest on his laurels causing his performance to suffer as a result.    Bringing up the rear in the performance category are Jodi Lyn O'Keefe (\\"The Crow: Salvation\\") and Adam Hann-Byrd (\\"Jumanji\\") in the heavily clichéd roles of the sex-crazed teenagers in the movie. Both roles are only included in the movie to fulfill some prerequisite that apparently stipulates that every horror film have at least one promiscuous couple within the cast. While almost every movie has one or two meaningless roles in their lineup, horror films always seem to make sure those roles are the most irritating to audiences; all the while, finding their way into more scenes than they deserve within the movie. I will admit that at least the writers seemed to attempt to flesh out Jodi and Adam's characters. Yet an over-reliance on sexual puns and unoriginality within the roles overshadowed all efforts to elevate the characters above being anything more than typical throwaway horny teenagers.    \\"Halloween H20: 20 Years Later\\" is the first sequel in the franchise to even come close to rivaling the original in any respect. While the film is stronger in some areas than the first \\"Halloween\\", it still never manages to recapture the atmosphere and style that was so integral to that one's success. Until someone can either channel John Carpenter's directing choices and abilities into another one of these installments or coax Carpenter into returning for another round, I doubt we'll ever see a movie in this franchise reach the level of the first one.    \\"Halloween H20: 20 Years Later\\" is rated R for violence, language, and sensuality.
B0001CNRS4|1.0|This movie is so bad, I don't even really want to write a review about it. Take every dancing movie cliche, music video technique, and Jessica Alba, roll it up into a sickingly sweet 90 minute story and you get Honey which, despite its name, really stinks.  Unless you are a big Jessica Alba fan, like Coyote Ugly, this movie is just way to lame once you get past the hot young female lead trying to make her way in life.  I will repeat this over and over, little kids 99% of the time just ruin a movie.  This holds true, with a annoying little kid that is suppose provide the cuteness, but I would prefer to see dribbled like a basketball and shot out of the movie.  About the only kid I've seen in a movie that didn't annoy me was the little girl in Aliens.  People need to stop putting little kids in movies!  They are not cute!  They are annoying!

B0007MWZEK|1.0|This is a simple machine and a great product, but it's destroyed by using cheap batteries that have poor performance. I loved the ease of it and that it did so well, but the batteries gave out after less than 3 months. After reading others' reviews, I realize it's a common problem. It's too bad. I would spend a bit more to have decent batteries in it, and others would too. A good product that is destroyed by one component. So does anyone have any recommendations for a cordless electric sweeper? Sorry, electrostatic ones don't work on bare floors.
B00000G3PA|4.0|4 of 5 stars for this sci-fi movie. A global killer--nothing survives, not even bacteria. An asteroid the size of Texas is en route to the Earth. With only 18 days before impact what do you do? Some early arriving asteroids (basketball size) rake NYC doing extreme damage. The only choice? Nuke it. How do you do that? Send a crew to drill a hole into the asteroid, implant the nuke, blast-it to break the asteroid into little bits. OK, who do you get to drill the hole? How about a crew of rough-necks (lead by Bruce Willis)? Things get complex when it turns out the asteroid is solid metal and it breaks drill bits.<br /><br />Very strong acting and characters. Willis really hits a home run with his character. Great special effects. The concept is a bit old, but, this is a fresh version. I do recommend this movie!
B002K0WBY6|5.0|In an interview I saw on the internet, Sandra Bullock says that it is simply unfair that this movie has no other category to be in than in the \\"chick flick\\" genre.  I guess this would have to depend on her definition of a chick flick, though.  Cuz, for me, this is a spectacular chick flick.  It has all the right ingredients:  funny, amazing chemistry, beautiful people, hilarious family, perfect plot and did I say funny?  I've almost never been disappointed with Sandra Bullock's movies, whether it be a chick flick or a thriller, but I was soo happy to see Ryan Reynolds getting attention for hitting it out of the ball park - which, I believe, he has been doing for years.  I've been eyeing this actor since the \\"Two Guys and a Girl\\" days and he is truly the new comic 'it' man.  I can't really think of any old timers to compare him with - but I think he is in the same league as John Krasinski, another fine comedian/actor of this generation.  I think real comedians, the ones that become 'great,' have the ability to be hilarious and also be real and deliver a performance that pulls at your heart - again, Ryan Reynolds hits a home run with this.  Yes, I'm a fan.<br /><br />This is just a feel-good fun movie.  I wanted to watch this again, right after credits rolled.  Seriously.  I will also say, this movie is a comedy first.  It will be an enjoyable time for both men and women.
B00000DR8R|5.0|I have replaced very few of my 80s releases LP collection on CD but this is one album that is worth buying again.  I listened to this constantly when it first came out on vinyl and continue to listen to it now.  Lloyd Cole's music doesn't sound dated and he's one of the artists from the 80s that I've never been embarrassed to admit I listen to.  There's a reason everyone has given this album 5 stars.
0061122416|1.0|Profoundly vapid, insipid, merit-less, pseudo-spiritual tripe.  If Cinderella is your idea of a good read, this will appeal to you. Could have been written in the time it takes to read. Next to this, the Harry Potter series merits a Nobel.  Humor, plotting, character development, intelligence, descriptiveness are all absent from this.  Like a bad classics comic without the nice drawings.
055358894X|5.0|i recently read scott lynch's the lies of locke lamora. i had avoided it for so long because i always thought it was a book aimed at the immature end of the fantasy spectrum. you know - aimed at kids who like reading salvatore, or terry goodkind.    however, having nothing around except a copy i'd been given as a gift, i cracked it open for a bit of a squizz and found something i hadn't expected - a really really good book.    i guess what made this book wincingly bad to me before i'd read it was the write-up on the back of the book which included:        The Thorn of Camorr is said to be an unbeatable swordsman, a master thief, a friend to the poor, a ghost that walks through walls...    ick. see what i mean? it reads like you're about to read some juvenile rubbish you wish had just stayed buried under a vogon's peat pile.    the book inside the cover, however, really doesn't seem to be about any of that at all. it's much more subtle and interesting to read, and in no way shape or form does our hero look, smell or even act like robin hood. it was a sort of blend of the the magnificent seven, ocean's eleven (take your pick), the godfather, and the dungeons and dragons franchise.    it's a healthy novel filled with suspense and told with a parallel backstory which provides you with a jaw-dropping finale. i was surprised not so much from the story itself, but how well-constructed it was. how cohesive. lynch has managed a masterpiece sure to go down as a classic of the genre. the fact that locke isn't a lost heir to a throne, a wielder of unqiue magic or a saviour of the kingdom, is simply testament to the power of this story which didn't give one inch into the pressures of the genre. he chose instead to create something deeply original.    if you're a fan of steven erikson, as i am, you'll simply fall over this book in spellbound rapture. the sequel, red seas under red skies is also an incredible novel. i mean, how can you go wrong? a fistful of con-artist thieves taking on the medieval mafia in book one and then taking on pirates and dictators in the sequel? well, if you're scott lynch, then you just couldn't go wrong if you turned off your torch and walked backwards in the forest in the middle of the night.    i look forward to book three.    i hope it's ninjas.

B002KAJ0AO|5.0|When I first heard \\"This is Us\\" I was a bit surprised since it was quite different than their last album, \\"Unbreakable\\" (which I really enjoyed), but once I got over the initial shock and listened to the songs again, I realized that this album really could be the best one yet. Their energy on this album is admirable, and their youthful back-to-basics approach is exhilarating.     I have been a Backstreet Boys fan for over 10 years now, and although my days of screaming in front of the television are over, when I saw them perform last night on Jimmy Kimmel Live, their energetic dance moves and obvious excitement over their new album took my breath away.     I am extremely impressed by their newest effort and sincerely hope that this album will make them successful again!
B002BSHXJA|5.0|OK, I love the mono mixes and the packaging is brilliant.     BUT: The Beatles Mono Box Set was originally advertised as a limited edition of 10,000 copies. So folks rushed to snap them up before they disappeared. Now it appears that EMI will print up as many as the market will bear, greatly exceeding the promised 10,000 copies.    Is it legal to do this? Isn't it a bait and switch. When you buy a limited edition print with say \\"5/100\\" where the edition is 100 and you're getting the 5th print in that edition, the artist is held to that number of prints, as the scarcity informs the value and ratchets up demand.    So it appears EMI (and Amazon) incentivized buyers to get the mono box, under the pretense of a \\"limited edition,\\" and is now proceeding to print up as many as the market will bear.    Does this not seem a bit sleazy? And I hate to rain on the Beatles Remasters Love Parade, but ultimately it all boils down to EMI and Amazon and other retailers maximizing their Beatles profit, not matter what they have to say.    I think it sucks.
B001EN71DG|5.0|I got this box set less than 48 hours after hitting the \\"Confirm Order\\" thanks to free 2-day shipping with Amazon Prime. It is exactly what I wanted, which was the original trilogy on DVD. The original copies of the movies on the bonus discs is indeed a bonus. I mainly wanted these movies because I own the original trilogy box sets, both the originals and special editions, on VHS.(Yes, that means the box set that is not numbered 4-6, nor is the first movie called \\"A New Hope\\") I just wanted good copies that I could watch while leaving the old dinosaurs in their cases. Finding this box set for $26.99 made it an instant buy for me because the individual DVDs are $15 each. So, $26.99 or $45, seemed common sense to me. While the box and slim DVD cases aren't of the highest durability, they do look nice on my shelf, and its not like their going to leave the shelf unless I am watching them.<br /><br />The picture quality and sound quality of the Special Edition films is awesome. The picture quality of the bonus discs is, like most say, VHS quality. Which I don't mind, since I was born after these films left theaters and the first time I saw them was on VHS. So, for me, watching the originals on these bonus discs is like seeing them for the first time all over again. It reminds me of the days of Game Genie and season 1 of Power Rangers, which I guess wasn't really that long ago, but it sure seems like it. Anyway, this is a box set worth buying since we don't know how much longer it will be until they produce BluRay copies and the BluRay box sets will probably cost $100+ each when they release. They already wanna tax soda, its only a matter of time before they start taxing movies and such also. Get them while they're cheap.
B002KDUDG6|4.0|(3.5 stars)<br /><br />There's no doubt in my mind that Michael Bubl&eacute; has incredible talent; it's just that he doesn't show as much of it as he could have on this album. Yes, his voice is in good form and he never misses a beat; but somehow the arrangements just don't sound or feel right and that's a disappointment. The quality of the sound is good and the artwork is interesting--it almost looks like Bubl&eacute; is trying to escape and get past through that yellow tape to burst forward and REALLY do a fine job.<br /><br />The album starts with \\"Cry Me a River;\\" I don't particularly care for that musical arrangement although Bubl&eacute; sings his part with energy--but it can't work all the way because of the arrangement. A stronger number is \\"All of Me;\\" this features Bubl&eacute; squarely in the spotlight and that's grand. Michael sings this with all his heart and soul; and the same can certainly be said of Michael's magnificent rendition of \\"Georgia on My Mind.\\" \\"Crazy Love\\" doesn't have the best arrangement although Michael's voice is strong; Bubl&eacute; does a noticeably better job on \\"Haven't Met You Yet.\\" \\"Haven't Met You Yet\\" is a nice highlight of this album.<br /><br />\\"All I Do Is Dream of You\\" has a great piano arrangement and the music fits perfectly with Michael's singing--this is good music. Those backup vocalists harmonize to perfection--not that Michael truly needs backup, but they do sound good anyway. \\"All I Do Is Dream of You\\" also has a jazzy flavor to it that works very well for this number. \\"Hold On\\" is easy on the ear and Michael does a good job on this; but his rendition of \\"Heartache Tonight,\\" a tune that rocked when The Eagles recorded it, just doesn't work for me. I can't quite put my finger on it--it sounds pretty rough to be a true Bubl&eacute; type of song--or maybe it's just that Bubl&eacute; didn't score a goal with this tune.<br /><br />\\"You're Nobody till Somebody Loves You\\" doesn't rank too high in my book. I just can't enjoy it as much as I usually do when I have heard others perform it. However, I really like \\"Baby (You've Got What It Takes).\\" \\"Baby (You've Got What It Takes)\\" is a dynamic number and Michael never skips a beat--it's energetic and I love every minute of it! Michael also gets terrific accompaniment from Sharon Jones & the Dap-Kings on \\"Baby (You've Got What It Takes).\\" \\"At This Moment\\" gets the royal treatment from Michael; Michael makes this shine and that's great.<br /><br />\\"Stardust\\" is another tune that works well; the relaxed, romantic arrangement does wonders for \\"Stardust\\" and this classic song is truly a highlight of this album.

B002BFBAWO|4.0|I mean it. The song \\"Rock me Amadeus\\" by Falco gets played several times. I couldn´t stand the song back in the 80´s and I still can´t stand it now. However other songs reminded me of the neon clothes era. I forgot which ones so that should tell you about this movie, it´s a forgetful movie, you´ll forget about it and never remember why you liked it or why you watched it in the first place!    The acting is good, the couple from SNL are funny, Kristen S and Jesse E deliver laughs and angst. Ryan Reynolds is cute to look at, Ron Howard´s daughter acts in this movie (first ever role), the rest who cares, not me.    The photography of the movie is just ok. The editing wasn´t good, there´s even a scene where you see a used cars lot with 2002 models!    The movie could have been better but overall isn´t bad. You get a happy ending along with a sexy last scene! Kristen´s beautiful eyes will leave you wanting this scene to be longer. She never dissapoints when it comes to showcase her beauty and raw sexiness.

The love she has for her sister Prime is a great baseline for the story. Katniss is an inspiration to us all as she is a true fighter/survivor. Of course there is the \\"love triangle\\". You can't HELP  but fall in love w/ Peeta & root for their romance. Yet, the whole time the book keeps you wondering about Gale & although he doesn't play a huge part in the story. He is always there.. you feel a devotion/respect/love for him & I totally understand why Katniss is torn! I read this book in 3 days... could not put it down. I am mad I didn't order the second part of the trilogy when I ordered this book. I'm on bed rest right now after having surgery & can NOT wait for it to be mailed. Sorry Amazon but I sent my hubby to the store to find Catching Fire(book 2). So I recommend just buy em both now so your not STARVING for more @ 1AM like I was.

0767817664|5.0|When it comes to horror of any genre, Vampires don't typically sit too high on Sid's priority list. It's not that the thought of a blood craving creature isn't scary but for some reason most of these film portray vampires as being a bit fruity. However there are some exceptions to our opinion with one being the 1985 classic Fright Night. A perfect blend a scares with laughs makes this one perfect for Sid's horror Octoberfest, and even gets the vampires into the mix. This one brings back memories of being very young which always adds a lot in the way of sentimental value.<br /><br />Fright Night is centered around young Charlie Brewster, his old lady, and annoying half pint buddy Evil Ed Thompson. Charlie is a horror movie junkie who spends most late nights watching some fine b(sounds a lot like someone we know). One night while watching a vampire flick he notices his new next door neighbors and they seem to be getting rid of a body and becomes very unnerved. The more he watches the neighbors the more he starts to think they're actually vampires. After telling his friends, who think he's nuts, he decides to enlist the help of his favorite washed up actor who plays a vampire killer in b movies. Seems logical. Now that he's assembled his crew of a couple high school kids and a old man it's time to take down the vampire neighbors which doesn't go so down too easy.<br /><br />Fright Night turned out to be just as good as it was nearly 24 years ago, just naturally a little less scary. It's a classic for a reason. It's even one of those feel good older horror films that could become an annual watch around the Halloween season simply for the memories it brings back. We even may hand out an woody award to the squeaky voiced Evil Ed for Hey Baby of the year. All around it was just right for what we'd hoped for in the vampire department. It certainly was enjoyed now as it was many years ago and comes with strong recommendation from the old boy Sid.
B000001DVD|5.0|I had this on vinyl when I was a kid and recently upgraded to disc for old time sake. I forgot how good this stuff was. Remember the days when a good single could actually have a guitar solo? - You probably don't, but this will bring it all back to you. The deep cuts are just as good as the obvious ones - I particularly dig Lady Strange. Hard rock ear candy.
B002KQ6BT6|1.0|Dan Brown supposedly spent five years researching and writing this pitiful excuse for a story.  The death of the lead character is inexcusable only to come back to life.  Our lady bleeds to death only to spring back to life without any medical assistance.  The dead spots in the story about some past event that has no connection to the plot.  Perhaps I expected too much after the DeVinci Code, but this sorry excuse for a story tears at Dan Browns credentials.  Save your money and don't buy this book!

B000001ESP|5.0|It starts bathed in swirling synthesizers, an angular drum pattern punctuated by a deep bass drum, taut snare and we are introduced to (perhaps) the quintessential Rush song; Tom Sawyer. The black and red colours of the album artwork fits the mood of the music perfectly, dark yet pulsing with life. We are then introduced to Red Barchetta, with its quiet, gentle guitar harmonics and deep, warm bass line, the mesmerising lyric is sung, \\"My uncle has a country place, that no-one knows about...\\" and the listener is taken on an unforgettable journey into what remains as possibly the finest album Rush ever recorded. YYZ, with its chiming morse code introduction, is musical nirvana, a showcase for each musician's developing virtuoso talents, yet the whole track works as an emotional construct that evokes such a broad range of excitement, feeling and imagery that you simply never tire of listening to its unfolding power. Limelight features one of Alex Lifeson's most evocative guitar solo's and whilst sounding hyper-commercial, it is one of the most complex compositions Rush has ever written.<br /><br />The Camera Eye is an epic, vibrant and pulsating track that positively brims with energy and has some spectacular drum fills from Neil Peart, indeed the drum sound on Moving Pictures really captures each spirited performance on every track with the tightness and fluidity of the drum flourishes helping to illustrate just how precise and powerful a drummer Neil Peart is. Witch Hunt, (Part III of Fear) and Vital Signs close the album, each track completely different from the other and displaying just how experimental the band were at that time. The brilliantly dark and brooding Witch Hunt starts with the beautifully eerie scene setting line, \\"The night is black without a moon...\\" and explores the sinister wilderness of ignorance and prejudice. The song also explodes in places with some gigantic drum fills from Peart that are stunning on a good sound system. Vital Signs, which was quite shocking to many people upon the album's initial release, with its strong reggae influences and electronic percussion is the perfect end to the album and is a subtle sample of what was to arrive with the bold experimentalism of Signals. The slick, polished production suits the tightness and sophistication of the music perfectly. Moving Pictures is arguably the definative Rush album and is, in my opinion, one of the greatest rock albums ever recorded.<br /><br />I could never convey all of the emotion and memory invested in this record, from the first time I heard it, to sharing it with friends, to listening to it walking in the snow, beneath the moonlight and feeling so very alive.shocking to many people upon the album's initial release, with its strong reggae influences and electronic percussion is the perfect end to the album and is a subtle sample of what was to arrive with the bold experimentalism of Signals.

1416594787|5.0|In this fascinating and informative book, Professor Dawkins demonstrates that evolution is the greatest show on earth.He makes a comparison between those who deny the evolution theory and the Holocaust deniers.To say that evolution does not exist is exactly like saying there had never been a Holocaust.  This book is an attack on creationists and all those who are still questioning the fact of evolution through natural selection.  He invites us to be detectives in order to look for evidence and facts supporting his ideas.We join him on a very interesting trail of various facts and examples from many disciplines and not just biology.These are taken from the world of insets, birds,trees-where he shows us how to measure time-fossils and traces of our ancestors.In addition,there are examples taken from genetics.There is an endless number of photos and diagrams to prove his ideas.  At the end of the book there is an appendix on the how evolution as a theory is being constantly oppressed and undermined in classrooms by those who seek to destroy it.Although there is room for optimism, the road to convince the creationists is still long and full of obstacles.  Perhaps it would be wise to quote his words towards the end of the book:\\"It is no accident that we find ourselves ....surrounded by endless forms,most beautiful and most wonderful, and it is no accident that we are surrounded by green plants ...(which all) give us the energy to power us\\".  Evolution is a fact, the Holocaust is a fact and all those deniers are trying in vain to distort reality.

B002KH4KSY|1.0|I'll spare you some wasted time... seriously.  Yeah, this movie is that bad.  I'd rather be bludgeoned unconscious with dried ears of corn than watch this film again.  (I live in Iowa, so this is an option!)  I had a few unintentional laughs, especially during the child killing spree the main protagonist went on during his escape attempt.  This film definitely has the highest body count of children killed in any horror film I've seen.  Between that and the \\"sex scene\\" in the film, I'm still shivering.  But anyway...  I digress.<br /><br />\\"Children of the Corn,\\" in case you actually are living in a cornfield, is a remake of a prior film of the same name, both of which are based on a Steven King story.  (I can still remember one of the creepy lines from the original film, although I haven't seen it in years: \\"He wants you too, Malachi. He wants you, too.\\") The plot is quite interesting for a horror film: it's set in a small Nebraska town and revolves around a religious cult composed of children that worship a being that lives in the corn fields.  A husband and wife encounter the kids, and the events that follow make up the rest of the story.  I'll not go into it in more detail, as other reviews have done it in already.<br /><br />Unlike a lot of people, I don't mind so much that Hollywood is hell-bent on making endless remakes, but I wish they would at least make a better remake.  This film is in no way better than its predecessor.  The acting is atrocious - not that they were given very good dialogue.  The lines were forced, and the actors are stiff and unbelievable.  The special effects are laughable and, if you can believe it, worse than the 1984 film.  So much for progress.  I think that I read that the SyFy (formerly known as Sci-fi) channel backed the making of this film or something to that effect.  I've gotten to the point where if I see Sci-fi channel on a DVD, I run.... I turn around and flee for my life. This movie should have been no different, but I only found this out post-viewing.  If the idea of this film is interesting to you, by all means, go watch the original film.  It's far superior.  You've been warned! :)found this out post-viewing.

B002JM1VJG|3.0|I grew up as a Madonna fan, watching her in the early days of MTV and waiting for her music videos to show up on rotation on public access TV where I could watch videos for \\"Burning Up\\" and \\"Everybody\\". When this video collection was announced, I thought it was a great idea. Even though I have both of her previously released video collections, I immediately pre-ordered this collection.<br /><br />Boy, was I in for a disappointment. Don't get me wrong, there are a lot of good videos on this collection, but for heaven's sake a CENSORED version of \\"Justify My Love\\"?<br /><br />The regular version of \\"True Blue\\" without the MTV viewer video? That contest was advertised for MONTHS on MTV back in the day and would have been an excellent inclusion.<br /><br />No \\"Drowned World/Substitute for Love\\", which is not only a great song/video, but virtually an explanation of Madonna's transformation from her early years to her current career?<br /><br />I love many of these videos, but this could and should have been a better compilation.  Madge deserved it and so do her loyal fans.
B002KDUDG6|5.0|Okay --- I've read the other reviews. Sure, this isn't the BEST album he's produced BUT ... the production is there, his voice is there, and he sings the crap out of all of it. Why the complaining? As someone who worked and still works with some of the greats in the music business, this album is stellar. Is it a \\"must buy\\" of his career? Hmmm ... good question. I think the main difference here is the David Foster \\"touch\\" is missing from some of the tracks, though he is Exec. Producing this entire project. The songs David personally produced show his hand in each one of them, from the styling and arrangements to the perfection of the vocal. The other productions on the record are very good, but a little out of Michael's forte: the big ballad and the big swing number. Song choices also have to be questioned (though the tracks written by Michael and his co-writers show greater complication in \\"pop\\" melodies than his previous attempts --- all this comes with time). With the plethora of material out there from the previous decades of masterful songwriters, why these songs? \\"Cry Me A River\\" is one of the best cuts on the album. The song was a standard for Judy Garland, and a big hit for Julie London decades ago. Melody and lyric are timeless, and David Foster's production stamp shows on the piece, and so do Michael's vocals. \\"Crazy Love\\" is another example of this. Now, the song may not be the caliber of \\"Cry Me A River\\", but this treatment of the song is very tender and caring. As I listen to the album completely, it seems a bit disjointed with material not referencing the same theme. His last effort, \\"Call Me Irresponsible\\", was a little disjointed and took some listening to over-and-over to finally enjoy the whole product. I think the main issue is this album isn't more of the same, but more \\"mixed-up\\" than other albums he has made, which is fine with me. I have to agree with a few of the other reviewers when I say there are tracks that are really good, while others fail to reach the same heights. \\"At This Moment\\" would be one of those songs that needs a \\"gruffer\\" sound (Billy Vera and the Beaters recorded this orginally), and a far less lush arrangement might have helped. Michael's voice is one that can sing with purity. Like Streisand, being a rocker is simply not your best work. Just an opinion ... prove me wrong, Michael: I will gladly take that back.    As Michael becomes more comfortable singing material that is new to the market (his own usually as well as some of David Foster's material), he is just getting better. His voice is spot-on, and like I say before, production quality cannot be beat.  One caveat: with a voice that sounds more and more like Frank Sinatra's earlier years, he needs to be careful not to try and sound like him by choosing material that he wouldn't have chosen. Sinatra's later years showed song choices not fit for his voice, but more fit for his phrasing. Michael just has to be careful of his material choices, and trust that David Foster will guide him in the right direction. He has for so many others.

1439138311|4.0|A pretty novel follows the story of a young female protagonist on her journey from Ireland to Brooklyn.  The story itself is as calm as the protagonist, but isn't that how most of our lives are?  Decisions are made by time and opportunity and life isn't always carved out in the way we think it might be.  The story considers home and obligation, longing and possibilities all within a fairly small world albeit it crosses the Atlantic.  Love grows and is precious in proximity but perhaps less so as time and space expand between partners.  Yet, the choices we have made in the past inform the present.  It's a lovely book and a sweet story the stakes are low... one woman, two lives - neither seems horrible, neither is ideal.  Her choices are made and accepted with grace and the story is told with similar grace.
0812979656|5.0|This book could have been about nothing at all and it would still be enjoyable to read the author's literary meanderings.  Such is the vivid and visceral impact of the authors writing style.  Each scene is a perfect balance of vivid detail and poetic colorings to transfer you in to the sentiments of the characters and the scenes they inhabit.  In addition, there is a beautifully written tragedy that will leave the reader transfixed.

0307346617|5.0|This is a deadly serious book that was quite fun to read.  While chronicling the recent zombie invasion is a deadly, serious manner, the author paints a vivid portrait of the characters involved that makes this book a joy to read.  This is no dry, history book depicting all the details that we all learned in school, but a celebration of the personalities that got us through the greatest peril mankind has ever faced.

0452295548|4.0|I first heard about this author when I was literally mesmerized by a talk with her on NPR.  I was in the middle of dealing with a major medical issue like the author, so the author's words were especially powerful.  I quickly grabbed the book and zoomed through it.  This book works on so many levels like virtually no other books I've read and only fails on one level.  You couldn't describe a more perfect tagline for a fascinating book, 'Brilliant brain scientist has massive stroke and returns to tell the story in an extremely informed manner'.  Think of it as scientific researcher in to the complexities of the mind, running an experiment on their own mind and you will get the idea.  The author's insights in to the workings of the brain, particularly the differences between the left and right hemisphere are  fascinating.  This narrative also works as a patients-advocate book.  The author gives insights in to the experience of being a patient to try and improve conditions for other patients.  Lastly the book works as a self-help book.  Her unique visit in to the world of the right hemisphere can illuminate and improve your life.  The book only slightly fails when she ventures in to New-Agey territory and personal experiences that aren't really backed by much science.  But this is a completely fascinating book.

0486450066|5.0|I mostly read this book because this year was Darwin's 200th birthday and the 150th anniversary of this great book and idea.  I also wanted to read it as a curious historical document because most people with an interest in science know much more about this idea than Darwin ever did.  But to understand how Darwin came up with this amazing theory, would be fascinating enough to justify the read.  Having said that, one of the fascinating things is how many of the difficult details Darwin got right.  It is fascinating to read the work of a true scientist and great naturalist.  A man who presented a controversial idea backed by evidence and then who proceeds to refute the arguments of inevitable but imaginary objectors.  This is the work of a sharp mind.

B000WGWQG8|5.0|David McCullough, the historian who wrote the biography of John Adams upon which this seven part mini-series was based, has won 2 Pulitzer Prizes. After seeing John Adams it is easy to see why. He researches his subjects until he almost knows them better than his own family. He takes what he has learned and tells the story so you see not only what they did, but why. He brings history to life. By focusing on John Adams he was careful not to be distracted too much by all the colorful characters such as Jefferson, Washington, Hamilton, and Franklin. They were all in the story, but it followed Adams and the Adams family, leaving out lots of other material. The story was about Adams and his role in the foundation of our republic, so that was as it should be. Adams has until now been kind of an unsung hero.<br /><br />Abigail Adams was also an unsung heroine, well played by Laura Linney. She was a feminist before there was even a word for such a thing, and gave her husband, John Adams, great advice. When he was away from her, he often made bad decisions. Unfortunately, she spent many years apart from him. After the American Revolution, she did get to join him in Europe, where she made quite an impression. While there she had an interesting flirtation with Thomas Jefferson, but later, when they were political enemies, she backed her husband to the hilt. Abigail had severe trials and tribulations, like when she had to have her family vacinated against smallpox. This was a risky and untested medical procedure in the 1700's. Abigail ran a farm and family, often all on her own.<br /><br />Throughout John Adams there was great production with lots of special effects and green screens to produce epic crowds and battles, and all manner of magnificent historical moments. Very good attention to the detail of the clothes, even changing styles year by year. What kind of three cornered hats did the fashionable folk wear in 1776? Watching John Adams, you are taken back in time to those tumultous days.<br /><br />Hamilton was a very interesting character and the dynamic between he and Jefferson, or Hamilton and Washington, was clearly illuminated. Hamilton longed to be an aristocrat and thought the country should be ruled by the rich and elite, or even a monarchy; while Jefferson believed in the ideal of Democracy. He saw his path to glory through war, which he longed for. Hamilton was much smarter about finances than Jefferson, and we have him to thank for our Federal Banks. Though Hamilton was an aide to George Washington, many thought that through his strong will he was really the one pulling the strings. Hamilton was well played by Rufus Sewell, who captured what must have been Alexander Hamilton's intensity well.<br /><br />In John Adams there is a great scene when in later years Adams views the iconic painting of the signing of the declaration of independence but says they were never all in one place signing, but scurrying to and fro preparing for war. He was kind of grumpy, and had his sideways \\"Merlot\\" moments, but after all he had been through, you could see why he felt and acted as he did.<br /><br />John Adams had some disappointments with his children, like one died an alcoholic, and another married a man who got into severe debt and had to leave his wife to seek work elsewhere. This daughter had breast cancer, had a masectomy, and later died after a relapse. On a more positive note, his oldest son, John Quincy Adams, later became President, though both John and John Quincy Adams only lasted for one term apiece.<br /><br />Paul Giamatti was great as Mr. Adams. He played Adams in every direction but sideways. Like Giamatti, Adams was short, grumpy, and not very attractive, but he held to his principles and accomplished a lot.<br /><br />Giamatti showed well the successes and failures of John Adams -- his strengths and his flaws -- for instance, he was really a fish out of water in France, and awkward as well in Britain, after the war. In France he couldn't keep up with Franklin. In Britain, he meets young insane King George and has to bow awkwardly. He spoke out and said what was on his mind, but this wasn't always the most diplomatic way to approach.<br /><br />Adams was ready to fight and go to war if necessary, but after the American Revolution was over he opposed Alexander Hamilton who wanted very badly to go to war with France. Though Adams mostly sided with Jefferson against Hamilton, Jefferson repayed him with betrayal, when for political reasons Thomas Jefferson was harshly critical and spread vicious rumors. Interestingly, too, as Adams got older he gave up his grudge and corresponded with Jefferson, as there was hardly anyone left who had been through what they had been through, who could understand and talk about it with him. Their correspondence was a great source of material for John Adams, the seven part mini-series.<br /><br />Great ending when both he and Jefferson die on the Fourth of July, exactly 50 years after 1776. How thoughtful of them to provide such an auspicious ending to the seven part mini-series. Famous last words of John Adams:<br /><br />-------------------<br />John Adams: Thomas Jefferson survives.<br />==========================<br /><br />Still competitive with his old rival, but actually it was Adams who survived Jefferson, if but only by a few hours. Though Jefferson was the author of the Declaration of Independence that said \\"all men are created equal\\" he was a slave owner. John and Abigail Adams managed to operate their farm without slaves.<br /><br />----------------------------<br />John Adams: My thoughts are so clear to me... each one takes perfect shape within my mind. But when I speak, when I offer them to others, they seem to lose all definition.<br />==================================<br /><br />John Adams wasn't the first time Giamatti and Linney played man and wife.

080701429X|5.0|I had received \\"Man's Search For Meaning\\" a couple of years ago as a gift. Since that time it had languished on my bookshelf, overcome by other priorities. After all, it was written in 1959, so it could wait a bit longer, right? Having just finished this book I really wish I would have made the time earlier. The lessons within could have easily been applied earlier and with great results. This book is simply remarkable. At 165 pages, \\"Man's Search For Meaning\\" is lightweight compared to some of my other reads, but this book took me some time to read, not because the subject matter was difficult, but because it really caused me to stop and reflect many a time. Great things really do come in small packages - less is more. \\"Man's Search For Meaning\\" is a life changing book that you simply cannot afford to pass up.
0765356147|5.0|Things really fall into place here and not in ways you would expect.  It definitely had me thinking and appreciating the entire trilogy well after finishing.  Some great forethought must have gone into crafting this story.  Rarely does the final book in a trilogy stand out as much as this one.  I liked this book much more than the first two, and I am glad I finished it.
B000002UB2|5.0|I'm no audiophile or LP collector but I wanted to get a copy of the Beatles Abbey Road on Vinyl. I was surprised to find that you could still buy it brand new on Amazon and for less than $14. Amazon lists this version as the Abbey Road [Vinyl] [Enhanced]. I'm not sure what the enhanced means. It looks and sounds like a regular LP except that it is brand new and thus has no scratches or pops. There is nothing on the album cover or back that indicates enhanced. Basically, I think it is just a brand new copy of the original album. It looks and sounds great.
B000HEWEE4|4.0|It's one of my favorite romantic fantasies.

B000P0J0AQ|5.0|For many, \\"The Matrix\\" is great special effects and great science fiction, which it undoubtedly is, and undoubtedly one of the best of the genre, but it is much more than that.     The Matrix is a spot-on science fiction analogy and metaphor for the manufactured and bogus reality (or \\"Matrix\\") that Americans are trapped in.  The Matrix is a created artificial reality that is so well-done that actual reality is completely concealed.  In the movie's Matrix and in the real (?) world , sometimes there is a \\"glitch\\" in the perception of \\"reality\\" that alerts a member of the Matrix that something is wrong with reality as they know it.  Neo (Keanu Reeves) pierces the computer-created reality and fights the \\"agents\\" that are the enforcers of the artificial intelligence that is exploiting humans (using them as organic batteries) and using the created reality of the Matrix to conceal their reality of exploitation.  This, of course, is easily analogized to using a media created reality enforced by various corporate agents to conceal their victims' similar exploitation as organic profit generators.    The Matrix is a milestone in moviemaking, special effects, fantastic action sequences, and use of an intelligent and imaginative science fiction plot to convey a message...a classic must-see movie.

B001OQCV2Y|4.0|Although violence as entertainment is not my cup of tea, violence against the violent is a horse of a different color.  Quentin's suggested retributional methods for the handling of Germany's right-wing extremists might just give pause to some of today's, there and elsewhere.  That can only be a good thing.    No one can (sanely) deny Tarantino's considerable skills as a filmmaker.  Those skills are unquestionably on display here.      All of the actors turn in great performances, with Til Schweiger not getting enough attention for his visual portrayal of what is perhaps the most intimidating German soldier in movie history.  Luckily for the Inglourious Basterds, he is one of them.      If one knows beforehand that the movie is fantasy, sort of a WWII fictional wish-fulfillment, they will enjoy it more.  Another \\"Valkyrie\\" it is not, but, of course, it was not meant to be.

0345495004|1.0|Frank Lloyd Wright and his lover were two completely self absorbed, imperious people who saw themselves above both morality and the law. When trying to explain himself to the general public, thru the press, Wright states that the law and morality are for the common man, not for he nor his paramour.  And he's supposed to be not merely intelligent, but brilliant.<br />The author repeatedly speaks about his paramour, Mameh Borthwick Cheney as being an intellectual.  Yet she never exhibits one original idea the woman had.<br />This is a story about lovers who decide to follow their bliss, their children be damned.  They are horrible people, and tedious to read about.<br />When writing novels, the author should remember to \\"show, don't tell\\".  She repeatedly spoke of how smart the lovers were, without showing any evidence of it.  Wright was an architectural force, but he had only one area in which he excelled.  In every other way he was an utter failure and fraud.  It was almost as if he were an idiot savant.<br />There was nothing in this book that wasn't repeated ad nauseum.  The writer is as tedious as the couple.
B0029LHW4U|1.0|I can't respect this or buy it. I have all of Jerry's solo albums and they are great, but this is not Alice in Chains. It's like Nirvana going on without Kurt Cobain. Do they really need the money? I won't buy this. I refuse to. They should have called it something else. Layne wasn't the whole band, but he was a big part of it. I mean Jerry wrote a lot of the songs also, but come on? Does Jerry need money? Calling it Alice in Chains is disrespectful to Layne. I mean this band is playing small venues and opening for bad bands now. It's a joke people.(Update, this album is actually really good, BUT IT SHOULD BE A JERRY CANTREL SOLO ALBUM! CALLING IT ALICE IN CHAINS WITHOUT LAYNE, NO, NO, AND NO. SORRY, STILL ONE STAR FOR DOING THAT)

B002BSHWUU|5.0|The set is inconsistent, but still great. The only thing that bothers me is how the Yellow Submarine song track sounds better. I really wish they remixed the vocals for the left right problem. I don't think thats really changing the music. Rigby sounds better on Yellow. So does Sgt. Pepper and When I'm sixty Four. It's annoying considering Yellow was from 1999. However, certain songs sound brilliant like Black Bird, Happiness is a warm gun, Within you, without you, Being for the benefit of mr.kite, Good morning, good morning. Etc. Point being is why didn't every song blow me away? Magical Mystery Tour sounds flat, although I admit it does sound better then the original which sounds a lot worse. Overall, the sound is better, but not much. I mean it's been over twenty years and there should be a dramatic difference and there isn't always one. The package is awesome! Enough said. The pictures, liner notes, etc. The mini docs are a throwaway, but a nice afterthought. I really think they should have remixed the set slightly without dramatically changing the music.
0385504225|1.0|The Lost Symbol is a huge disappointment.  Most people reading the book probably enjoyed The Da Vinci Code & Angels & Demons, and the let down here with this book is tremendous.  I am among the probably many readers who happened to love the DVC & A&D.  The books were exhilarating - it felt as if I were dashing through the many sites in Paris & Rome with Robert Langdon, trying to decipher the mysteries.  The pacing of those books were perfect, almost breathless, & both books made readers feel as if they were watching movies in their heads.    Which brings us to The Lost Symbol.  At first, it felt like the National Treasure movies with Nicholas Cage, but less interesting.  The pace was missing in the book; it had none of the thrilling components of the previous two books featuring Langdon.  As other reviewers noted, there were tiresome patterns in the book (revelation, disbelief, revelation, more disbelief).  Robert Langdon also seemed less of a mystery solver this time, & more of a straight foil.  The symbols involved seemed overwrought.  The end, where it tries to tie up the loose ends, lost steam, especially since the plot involved Malakh was over.  It was hard to maintain the interest to last through the final pages of the book.    Not sure exactly what went wrong, but if I had to list the major shortcomings, they would be lack of pacing, Langdon's character being different from previous books, the symbols not being interesting enough, & a sense that the book was trying to incorporate too much (Katherine's noetic science research had the potential to be interesting but did not figure prominently in the core of the book... so why was it even included or mentioned?).    Dan Brown can certainly do better.  Someone said that this book was too much of the same, as in formulaic Dan Brown, but I think this one jumps out as being different, as in lacking that special ingredient found in the previous books.
B002KDUDG6|3.0|First the rave: the final track on this CD, \\"Whatever it takes\\" a collaboration with Ron Sexsmith, is s-w-e-e-t. Rich smooth instrumentation, beautiful blend of vocals, I wish the entire CD was a joint venture. Sadly it is not.     With throw back singers there is always the danger of sounding old instead of retro. A song, or entire CD, can easily come off stale if it isn't changed up enough or made different. Large parts of this CD need a good airing. There is no reason to have an artist as talented as Michael Buble sing these songs straight up. He is known for his vocal styling and impish inflections. There is just not enough playfulness or fun here.     That said - there are a few gems in the bunch: \\"Cry me a River\\" (arranged by the wonderful David Foster) is a bold, brassy number, \\"All I do is Dream of You\\" (another Foster arrangement) is a hit, and \\"Baby (you've got what it takes)\\" with Sharon Jones & the Dap-Kings is playful fun. So with the aforementioned \\"Whatever it takes\\" (uh did I mention Foster arranged this one too?)that makes it 4 hits and 9 near or full on misses.     Do I recommend buying this CD? For die hard fans like me - yes. For those on fence - probably not, but I absolutely would down load \\"Whatever it takes\\".
B000TGJ80S|4.0|This movie has some of the best horror cinematography I have ever seen. (And I have seen them all). It shows photography work that has never been seen before- nor since. This is by far the best Dracula \\"visual\\" ever! My main complaint is the story is mostly a visual and lacks certain elements of the acting style that we have been accustomed to in the 21st century. For example when Johnathan Harker spends all the time in Draculas castle, he sees strange things and he does not react to them. From mirrors breaking, to seeing Dracula climbing the castle walls and the weird shadow play - Harker acts like nothing is out of the ordinary.<br />  That is by far the films worst downfall. THe story line is pretty much the basic Bram Stoker story. But I will emphasize- the visuals are stunning and horrifying in this movie!

B001TKADSY|4.0|This is a powerful book. I had already read The Kite Runner, but had not felt compelled to take up Khaled Hosseini's second work. However, after numerous people suggested to me that it was much better, though harder to read, I decided to take it up. The commentary on the back of the book describes it as \\"big-hearted\\"; that \\"[Love] is the emotion...that suffuses the pages\\". I didn't see that as much, to be honest. This book is a statement of the endurance of people whose lives are bound up in their homes, who cannot escape the pain their homes are built upon. While love is a partial backdrop, solidarity and suffering are the themes. It speaks to the basic human need to look for hope, to desire to cling to life, even though it kills us.<br /><br />The book is set in Afghanistan, running from the 1970's into this decade. Herat and Kabul, and the hope to be found in nearby Pakistan, are pivotal. The family life of the book is set against the backdrop of the Soviet occupation, the warlords who replace them, and the rise of the Taliban. One sees history unfold in a way that shocks, where the western impression of the Soviet era is contrasted with the heightened rights of women and the removal of the communist order eventually brings the suffering of Shari'a law. And the often heard name Taliban, so hated and despised in America, is viewed, at least at first, with joy; spoken in glowing terms and with hope. This joy is mixed: for many, it is only a harbinger of worse things.<br /><br />This book especially highlights the suffering of Afghanistan's women, disallowed to have any say in the progress of their lives, blown about by the winds of circumstance, held under thumb by the men who rule them. While not specifically attacking the social order, it demonstrates the hardness of heart that turns acts of mercy into acts of power and control, acts of kindness into acts of despicable torture.<br /><br />To speak of \\"enjoying\\" the book would perhaps be a misuse of the word. I thought the text compelling, the events on the whole believable, the descriptions of characters and setting palpable.  But it would be hard to read without a slight aversion, as Hosseini documents the abuse of the main characters with strong language. His depiction of Mariam's father shows a man characterized by a lack of courage, yet loved, even idolized, at the expense of real love. His depiction of the hard-hearted yet self-justifying husband is startling and made me cringe, while at the same time providing a sense that he was not entirely at fault; an understandable creation of his environment, oft-betrayed, yet an arrogant and uncompassionate villain, who twisted acts of mercy into tools of oppression.<br /><br />The beginning of the book is slow, to say the least. It was a fight to get into the second half of the book. But once there, it was hard to put down, despite the suffering recounted. I thought that there were a number of leaps in the flow that left one wondering if they were not contrived or forced. It left me asking on a few occasions, \\"Why was that necessary?\\" Obviously, a writer is free to write whatever flow of action he wants. But sometimes the pain and hurt seemed gratuitous, going too far. As if there could have been a different outcome, that maybe naturally there even would have been. I will not second-guess the narrative and suggest that it is exaggerated. Rather, one shares the hope the women cling to despite a constant awareness that things can only end badly.<br /><br />That being said, the book ends with a quasi-positive. Similar to the ending of The Kite Runner, there is the possibility of happiness, but it is not yet realized. One wonders if it really will be. Not all ends well. Nor would we find truth in a book where all did end well, most likely. We live in a time when we see life through dark glasses. And maybe with good reason. In that light, A Thousand Splendid Suns will stand as a testament to the pain experienced by two generations- both in Afghanistan, and beyond - those who felt, if almost imperceptibly, the ripples of darkness.<br /><br />Overall: Powerful narrative, compelling emotion, but it will require a strong stomach (and some patience in the first half).e who felt, if almost imperceptibly, the ripples of darkness.

0385737947|3.0|The Maze Runner reminds me of a video game.  One labeled \\"M\\" for Mature.  It's a bit intense for kids.  Heck, it's probably too intense for a lot of adults.  The maze is a violent place, where characters you care about die, and the violence is sometimes gruesome.    The scenario is very much like what you might find in a video game.  The hero wakes up in a strange world, with no memory of who he is or where he came from.  There are horrible monsters to avoid or defeat, and puzzles to solve, all in a strikingly visual and mysterious setting.  (The way out of the maze won't be a surprise to anyone who has played a lot of video games.)    And as in most video games, the mystery is solved at the end...and it's a bit of a letdown.    However, like a good video game, the book is very engaging, and pulls you through it quickly, mainly because of curiosity over what will happen next.  The characters seem rather flat, but then, that goes with the video game territory.  The hero, Thomas, is a bit of a \\"Mary Sue.\\"  Smarter and stronger and braver than the rest, with talents the others don't have.  The lone female character was pretty much a cypher.  The author tries to make her smart and spunky, etc., but there didn't seem to be a reason for her to be there, except to be Thomas' love interest.  I guess every video game has to have some eye candy.    I didn't realize when I first read this book that it was supposed to be the first in a trilogy.  That might explain the strangely abrupt and unsatisfying ending.      Am I going to read the other books when they're published?  Undecided.  I enjoyed this book, but the best part of it was the mystery.  With that solved, I'm not sure I'm interested enough to follow these characters any further.
B000M5AJQI|3.0|A good story, a stellar cast performing brilliantly, the director of one of the greatest films of all time (The Godfather). . .  What could go wrong.  Well, a lot.  If you love hearing the \\"F\\" word, this is your film.  Its frequency of use was both unnecessary and boring.  (Scorcese created The Godfather without using it and became a directorial legend.)  If you love a film with fast, confusing cuts that bounce between time, then this is the one for you.  If you love cops that act as bad as the criminals, buy this one today.  The film improved as it went along, but the first half hour was slow and jumbled thanks to the cutting.  It finally settled in only to end absurdly with almost everyone being revealed as a double agent and/or murderer.  Mark Wahlburg's Sgt. Dingham character was over written and drastically over played.  His character should have been first to die in the film.  If it weren't for the performances, this film would rate a 2, although we've seen Nicholson in this type of role many times before.    Addendum:  Of course I am wrong in saying that Scorsese directed The Godfather.  That was Coppola, and I knew that.  Brain cramp.  The opposite of foul-mouthed movies is not Walt Disney, as one of my critics has noted.  I might retort that, if you wish to hear that word in abundance, watch porno.  As Alfred Hitchcock stated: If you portray a man entering a meeting carrying a briefcase that the audience knows contains a ticking time bomb, that is what builds the tension, not the explosion itself.  Indeed, it is anti-climactic.  Film makers have largely forgotten that principle, and audiences, now with shortened attention spans by feeding on a diet of such films, demand violence as an inevitable end.  The Departed is still a poorly constructed film, and the police as portrayed were, to a man, as despicable as the criminals.
B002KDUDG6|5.0|I have always been a big fan of Michael Buble so I was captivated by his new cd. His voice is great. The music is wonderful. A jazzy feel. My husband described it as old style beat with modern day singing. Great comeback since he has not made a cd in over two years. Crazy Love is a huge hit in my house. Some new hit but yet familiar tunes that I could sing along with. Hopefully will be able to see Michael one day in concert.
0140177396|1.0|I unfortunately had to read this book for school because its required for 9th grade. The book was a little hard to follow and i think that this book is too mature. There is so much swearing that you will not even believe it. The \\"n\\" word is used often and so is a lot of other bad things I cant(and don't) even want to type. Save this book for older high school students. I read some other reviews and they state that they were required to read this on 8th grade. That's just crazy!

I accidentally left this book at a deli and the staff was sad when I came to retrieve it.  It was living behind the bar and the employees were grabbing quick reads between shifts.  It probably is now filled with innumerable germs and food borne bacteria but I love it and will not part with it and still reread it when I need a lift--which is quite often.      I like to retell Sedaris stories. My favorite from Me Talk Pretty is the one where David compares his boyhood experience watching a Herbie;the talking car movie in the States with that of his boyfriend Hugh who watched it in an African country. Hugh's father, a diplomate,  was late picking him up from the theater so he had to wait outside while a dead man hung from a post, swinging in the breeze.

On most songs, I could hear instruments and notes I had never ever noticed before even though I am very familiar with this music, being I grew up listening to it and never lost my love of it. As a matter of fact I believe the older material like For Sale sound even more impressive than the newer recordings like Abbey Road.
0307266303|5.0|Fantastic book that while offering a compelling read, also is a lesson in anthropology, geography, physiology and, of course, running. The story is terrific, leading up to the exciting race at the end. McDougall is a great writer, putting one in the Copper Canyon and the world of the Tarahumara Indians. There is a very unique and eclectic group of characters, most notably Caballo Blanco and others. I have been a runner on and off for 30+ years, and like McDougall have sadly accepted running injuries as the norm. I have rarely gone without some ache or pain in years - last year alone I suffered from Plantar Fasciitis, Runner's Knee and Shin Splints. Also like McDougall I find these injuries totally worth the experience. Now, after reading some very convincing, well documented articles that question the whole running establishment, I have just bought a pair of Vibram Five Fingers which I am anxious to try out. Hopefully my results will be like McDougall's.    I dont think, though, that one has to be a runner to truly appreciate this book because it is so rich and diverse. It deserves all the hype.
0792846443|5.0|I don't own the \\"Misery\\" DVD, but I have seen it three times, and each time, the movie is just as shocking and intense as before. Rob Reiner is the director, and adapts the Stephen King novel to the screen. Considering most of the film takes place in a bedroom, you're going to need a pretty good script to keep such a concept alive and interesting. Fortunately, \\"Misery\\" is full of interesting plot developments, and as the story moves along, nothing feels boring or tedious. In fact, two of the times I saw this movie were back-to-back on TV (thanks for that, AMC!), and I can honestly say I watched it both times, in a row, without ever getting bored.    In addition to Rob Reiner's great directing, we have the talented acting of James Kahn and Kathy Bates, both of whom portray their characters quite realistically and believably. The realism of their acting is partially what makes this movie so frightening, because James Kahn and Kathy Bates make it seem like this sort of things could actually happen, which is a powerful tool in horror movies. In addition, there's no way you can give this movie less than 5 stars after seeing the heart-pounding, realistic terror in the climax!    Well, my time here is done. In closing, this is a highly-recommended horror movie for those that want to see an excellent, entertaining and nerve-wracking work of horror genius, especially if you're interested in seeing the realistic side of horror movies. Thanks for the time, and peace.
0385504225|2.0|I enjoyed \\"DaVinci Code.\\" I enjoyed \\"Angels and Demons\\" even more and thoroughly enjoyed the illustrated editions of both books. \\"The Lost Symbol\\" was a disappointment. While the idea of using Washington DC as a setting for exploring early-American symbolism seemed fascinating, it didn't pan out; apparently, there aren't that many interesting symbols in DC after all. And, the big conspiracy wasn't so big. The giant cabal turned out to be closer to a Rotary Club than Comintern. Worse, a major subplot involving metaphysics was silly and wound up having little to do with the story.<br /><br />After the historical and intellectual sweep and scope of the earlier two books, \\"The Lost Symbol\\" just seemed...smaller. If you're a Dan Brown fan, I'd wait for the paperback. If you're not a Dan Brown fan, I recommend reading \\"Angels and Demons\\" and \\"The DaVinci Code\\" first.
B002JTMNX2|3.0|I'm a big Foreigner fan from the old days...This album sounds good...and new singer is really good.  Songs are all well done...just nothing that blows me away.  And if feels a little weird that only 1 member of original band is left.  I still can't believe Foreigner is not in Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.  What a joke!
B002KDUDG6|2.0|What's to say except there's alot more of the same from Bublé. I was totally disappointed in his remake of \\"Crazy Love\\". There are already many cover versions of this. But since I love the song I was looking forward to hearing what he would do with it. Tempo too fast, mediocre arrangement. Most of the tracks here sound exactly like what you would expect. To be fair, many of the covers he chose I am not crazy about to begin with. So his song selection is not going to score points with me. I am even disappointed in his single \\"Haven't Met You Yet\\". Pleasant but nothing to get excited about. \\"Home\\" and \\"Everything\\" blow it out the water. The album gets two big thumbs up for the inclusion of \\"Whatever It Takes\\". I absolutely love this song. So much so that I gave it it's own review with 5 stars in the mp3 store. This is THE TRACK of the album in my opinion. However, like I said in my review of WIT, I am not a die-hard Bublé fan. But I'll have \\"Whatever It Takes\\" on repeat for weeks to come.
B002KDUDG6|5.0|I was kind of amazed, really, when I saw how many people gave this album poor reviews. Obviously I've only \\"known\\" this album for a day (I couldn't think of a better verb, ha ha), but so far I am completely in love with it. It seems bolder than his other albums to me, like it has more personality, I guess. For me it's the perfect mix of the old and comfortable and the new and surprising. Michael just keeps getting better!
0143036742|4.0|I read two books from this author; A Short History of Tractors in Ukrainian and Two Caravans.  I recommend them both.  Thoroughly enjoyable.  I liked the characters, the writing was entertaining, some parts truly funny and other parts hard and sad as real life is.  I even learned a few things about migrant workers; a nice surprise or by-product of reading Two Caravans, I wasn't expecting that.  Don't make my mistake though, I didn't realize that Strawberry Fields and Two Caravans are the same book but with different titles.  Oh well now I have 2 copies.  I liked these two books enough to read them again.  The characters have stayed with me, so go for it and enjoy.
0790744295|5.0|Well, considering it's the month of Halloween, I figure I better catch up on my horror reviews. \\"Creepshow\\" is an anthology movie from the genius minds of both Stephen King and George Romero, containing several horror-comedy episodes, all at around 20 minutes or so. To this day, such an idea hasn't been done that often, and considering how novel it was at the time it was made, Romero and King pull this off very well. All the stories are entertaining and chilling, and the last one, if you have insectophobia, will be quite a shocker! For a fun and chilling way to spend your Friday night, enter the Creepshow! Thanks for the time, and peace.
B001AQT11M|1.0|i was really disapointed with this product. i bought it because it was a 2 disk dvd with bonus bluray disc. but that was not so. it is a 2 disc bluray with 1 dvd packaged in the dvd packageing
B00021HBGS|5.0|I really have never seen him more thrilled with a single toy. He wants to live in the bath now. The toy also facilitates a lot of conversation during the bath. It is great.
0385504225|2.0|I write about this phenomenon only because Dan Brown has already become one of the most widely read authors in modern times. The fact that this is a real literary tragedy should not deter us from recognizing that people are reading his books and they are not reading my books. Brown's last three books have created this phenomenon. Angels and Demons dealt with the Roman Catholic Church and diabolical secret societies and was set in Rome. The blockbuster DaVinci Code dealt again with the Roman Church but also offered a revised version of early Christian history with a plot spread over Europe. The Lost Symbol deals entirely with the Masonic Order and is set entirely in Washington, D.C.<br /><br />Lost Symbol deals, as does all of Brown's books, with arcane symbols, this time with those symbols and secret vows of the Ancient and Free Order of Masons. The hero, Robert Langdon, Professor of something called Symbology at Harvard, is enlisted by what he thinks is his old mentor to lecture one Sunday evening in Washington. He finally realizes that he has been drawn into an involved family conflict that spreads to the Masonic Order and the possible discovery of the \\"Ancient Wisdom\\" hidden somewhere in the depths of the city known for its Masonic connections going back to the founding fathers.  I have said enough about the plot in case my readers desire to follow the murky and highly repetitive wanderings of the characters through the labyrinthine world of Masonic rituals, oaths, and secrets. From the start we are also introduced to one of the most evil characters in fiction, possibly worse than Hannibal Lecter in \\"Silence of the Lambs\\" and Javier Bardem's assassin in \\"No Country for Old Men.\\"  While I don't think the pacing of \\"Symbol\\" is as effective as that in \\"Angels\\" and \\"DaVinci,\\" about half way through the characters begin their improbable escape from enemies that are not really their enemies until the climax on a sacrificial table in still another Masonic Temple  (surprised?).<br /><br />I have tired of Brown's style and it was hard to stay up with the interminable impromptu lectures from Professor Langdon at most improbable times (while standing over a severed hand?). I also had a hard time recognizing that our knowledge that many of our nation's leaders are Masons constitutes a national emergency of the level that the CIA's greatest resources are employed. I know this is fiction, but there needs to be consistency and reality within the fictional world of a novel, right? To read about a person's drowning death, in language that is clearly describing a human death, only to be informed later than he really didn't die but was breathing water all the time ...  come one! That is a trick that an omniscient author plays on an unsuspecting reader that is entirely different from an unexpected plot twist.<br /><br />While it may appear that Brown has done his research, Latin and Greek readers will recognize that he has made serious mistakes in translating both of these languages and the supposed insights that he shares from his linguistic mistakes are major steps in the plot. His research is so filled with mistakes like this and numerous other evil canards about Masonic history that the poor Masons probably are wondering how they are going to handle all the new applicants that will appear after this book is widely read!<br /><br />I hold no brief for the Masonic Order, but I do for Christianity and Brown has now done the same hatchet job on both. Please, Dan, spare us another novel that exposes whatever whipping boy you think will enlighten us - and add to your retirement fund!  Perhaps Mother's Day is a good target. I have always wondered about the diabolical secret codes embedded in those cards!
B002KAJ0AO|3.0|I really liked BSB's last few releases. The sound is more mature, and in my opinion, the songs are just better. I looove the songs like Unsuspecting Sunday Afternoon, Trouble Is, Panic, Something That I Already Know, etc. This album was a letdown for me. It's just so generic, like any of the artists out there today could have made it. The guys in BSB are too old for this (I agree with Anastatia's review!).   Now for what saves this album from my outright ridicule: Bigger. Yes, it's corny, yes, it's predictable, but at least it isn't over-produced generic pop.
0385504225|4.0|It took two days to hit me after reading the book. For those of you who didn't enjoy the book I suggest you re-think it: see it as a parable, which is exactly what the story is about. Robert's chase down dark hallways etc. is symbolic to the message at the end, that our religious teachings are all parables and we are mis-reading them by looking in all the wrong places.
B001QBC4AG|3.0|This album is not iconic, and probably did not deserve a deluxe edition.  Other then the uniqueness of the advertisements in between some of the songs, and the brilliant cover art, an album becomes essential largely when a band believes in the album, and performs the songs from said album.  Once released, few if any of the songs on this disc ended up being performed live, and if so were soon dropped from the lineup, never to be performed again (this is unbelievable in light of \\"I Can See For Miles\\" being the greatest Who song ever for my money).  Another great one is \\"Armenia City In The Sky\\".  There were also a few other awesome tracks:  \\"Mary Anne With The Shaky Hand\\", \\"I Can't Reach You\\", and \\"Our Love Was\\", many of which were sung by Pete Townshend, instead of Roger Daltrey (not necessarily a band effort). The Who's set list became stale long ago, and unfortunately, other then \\"Relax\\" and \\"Tatoo\\", never included much of this album, which is criminal.
B002MTTZ5I|2.0|A song or 2 is hilarious but an entire album gets a bit slooooow!  Long live hair metal but damn - these guys don't know when to say when!
B001XRLWPQ|3.0|If you have watched Bones, NCIS, CSI or any other procedural crime show you will instantly recognize Castle's formula. Murder of the week, initial suspect(s) usually turns out to be red herring (or in a variation, guilt circles back to someone unsuspected at the beginning), some new and somehow previously overlooked piece of evidence or insight leads them to the guilty party just in time. This rigid formula is not really the fault of Castle per se, it's just a result of the type of show Castle is. Also like Bones, Castle does add an over-arching storyline every 3-5 episodes or so, the unsolved murder of Beckett's mother (so much like Bones in fact it's a direct copy.) This has yet to really develop Beckett however.     Of course all these type shows need a gimmick to break free of the same procedural formula. Bones did this by pairing an eccentric anthropologist with a tough but likeable FBI agent with some success until the writer's strike at least in my view. Castle tries to use the hook of pairing a hedonistic writer with a stiff NY police detective. Not exactly leaps and bounds of separation in the means used to escape the formula with the two shows. Also very similar is the romantic tension between the lead characters of the two shows.    Speaking of the leads, Fillion is brilliant as Castle. Imagine Mal from Firefly wasn't a futuristic space smuggler (without the associated emotional baggage), but a present day NYC author and father and you have Castle. Fillion plays the roguish type well, but he adds the aspect of being a caring father and son for this role, and does it all well. In short, he makes the show for me and is the reason I still watch it and hope for it to become more than it is. Castle and his family seem to me to be the only real characters on the show at this point, although his daughter is somewhat too mature and perfect sometimes. However one mildly annoying aspect to the family relationship is how in a few episodes crimes are solved by some unrelated interaction between Castle and his daughter wherein she might say something to the effect of \\"my boyfriend would never do that\\" and Castle makes some great intuitive leap from her comment to suddenly solve the case. But, that's the rigid murder of the week formula striking again.     Now, on the other side of Fillion's well defined and fully developed character is Det. Kate Beckett.  In stark contrast to Castle, her character is barely developed at all. The first time we even see her at home was in the second season! Did she live at the police station for season one? She has no personality to me and is not likeable in my view because she is so one dimensional. She has a bad attitude towards Castle for example, but for no real reason (that is ever explained beyond she is just itchy with a b). In one episode she says she \\"hates cops who can't think outside their own stories\\" meaning cops who don't go all the way to solve crimes or who won't use unconventional means to solve a crime. So why then is she so opposed to Castle being there? He often solves cases the police would not have. Some people decry comparisons to Bones, but the similarities are self evident. One major difference is that both Booth and Bones were developed characters and not hollow stereotypes. I know this type of show doesn't focus as much on character development (one reason I'm not a huge fan of the genre), but some would be nice.      As for the supporting players, Castle's mother is a more loveable and lucid Lucile Bluth from Arrested Development and you can follow the logical progression of Castle's childhood with her to his life now pretty well. His daughter Alexis is the only mature member of his family and is played well by Molly Quinn. Though she's a bit too goody-two-shoes to be realistic sometimes. Bursting into tears for jumping a subway turnstile for example, a bit overmuch in the nice department there. Most of the time though his family, including his vapid ex-wife, are well played and believable.     Pretty much all the cops are total stereotypes though. Ryan and Esposito are likeable enough but are reduced to bit players with not a lot to do but be ordered around by Beckett. The police captain, medical examiners, other cops, mayor, etc are generally window dressing. Which would be ok if Beckett had any level of development beyond hard-nosed feminist cop who orders men around and is surly.     In short, Castle makes the show for me and Beckett along with the genre ruin it(but mostly Beckett). And don't call me a chauvinist. My favorite show ever is Buffy the Vampire Slayer, so I have nothing against strong female leads. I just like to have fully developed ones.     In my review I took off one star because this a procedural crime show with a rigid formula built in by design and another star because Beckett is a total stereotype. If you really like crime procedurals and/or stereotypes, add 1-2 stars accordingly.
0385504225|1.0|The DVC was great fun. Not literature, not always believable - but hey its fiction and was a great ride.  This book is terrible. Over the top attempt at dark mysticism... Bland re-hash of DC tourist sites... its like DB took a guidebook and came up with a (very) lazy plot in an afternoon.  There are plenty of other reviews that go into the details of why this book is so terrible, so no need to repeat.  Save your $$$s. If you must, buy 2nd hand, or wait for the cheap paperbacks to come out.
B002KDUDG6|2.0|I like Michael Buble a lot and have all his CDs, but this one was a big disappointment for me. 1-2 songs are OK, but the rest...  I played that CD 5 times trying to love it.  No results... no chemistry, I think. Many songs have the same rhythm and are very boring. Who picked the song selection? There are so many great old songs to chose from! What about new original songs? We have a lot of composers, who have great material. 5 stars for Michael's voice and 0 for the song selection. Makes it 2 Stars. Lets wait for the next release.
B001GWK2MC|4.0|My nephews love this bouncer.  It inflates in minutes with a pump(not included) and has a large play area for their castle sieges.
B001XRLWPQ|4.0|I don't mind it if other shows try to emulate that sizzling chemistry put out by them folks at BONES. Frankly, there's a lot of television series out there who could do with that sort of zing. CASTLE has got a nice gimmick, but no surprise that its success rests hugely on how Nathan Fillion and Stana Katic mesh onscreen. Thankfully for CASTLE, the two leads create sparks together.<br /><br />Best-selling mystery novelist and dashing man-about-town Richard Castle lives it up big. Got the fame and glamor, the wealth, and the beautiful broads. Castle gets involved with NYPD when a serial killer begins to lift murder scenes from his past novels. That case solved, Castle decides to stick around the precinct as a consultant, regarding this as an opportunity to harvest ideas for future bestsellers (he's kind of nursing this writer's block). This doesn't at all suit standoffish and driven NYPD Homicide Detective Kate Beckett, but she has no choice since Castle's got an in with the mayor. And, of course, Detective Beckett also being this beautiful babe doesn't have anything to do with Castle wanting to hang around. He sees her as a challenge. She calls him a \\"nine-year-old on a sugar rush.\\" You get the picture.<br /><br />Are Castle and Beckett the sexiest sleuths since Temperance Brennan and Special Agent Seeley Booth? I dunno, but they're certainly in the running. Nathan Fillion - who should be on TV or in films as much as possible (don't give me that crap about his needing a personal life) - has got his easy-going rakish charm going on, the perfect foil to Stana Katic's uptight, chip-on-the-shoulder brand of sexy. There's nothing like that sly sexual tension wafting in the air, even as we realize that if these two ever do get together, it won't be until a good long while, with ABC milking the thing for all the Nielsen ratings it can squeeze out. Meanwhile, we soak in all that suggestive banter and innuendo.<br /><br />To be honest, the murder cases take a back seat. To me, they're only interesting in that they at times provide peeks into the makeup of the show's characters. Episode 6, for example, opens up Beckett's painful past as she makes a personal connection with the case at hand. We learn why she decided to become a police detective. But there's more to Kate Beckett than being prickly and a control freak. As she sasses to Castle: \\"O so many layers to the Beckett onion - however will you peel them all?\\" We learn more about her later on, especially when her old flame reappears and looks to be staying around for a while - because, as we know, there has to be that obligatory romantic third wheel.<br /><br />I dig that, although Castle may be big noise elsewhere, he's treated like a rookie in the precinct. In the first couple of episodes, he's often directed to stay in the car while the real detectives went off to investigate. Of course, Castle doesn't listen and sometimes ends up bumbling things. But, gradually, he wins Beckett's squad over, because the guy does have this outside-the-box intuitiveness. His vivid writer's imagination does come in handy, not to mention all his big time connections and also that espresso machine he just bought the squad. I get a kick out of how Rick Castle so gets a kick out of shadowing Beckett and crew. \\"Nine-year-old on a sugar rush\\" seems right. However, another perfectly apt quote regarding Castle comes from Castle himself: \\"Some people love the institution, hate the day-to-day.\\"<br /><br />We'd think him a more frivolous guy than he really is, except early on we learn just how wonderful of a dad he is. His interactions with his teen daughter Alexis (Molly Quinn) continually provides some of the show's best \\"aww\\" moments. On the other hand, I can't stand Castle's over-the-top ex-stage actress mom.<br /><br />Only ten episodes, and the last one ends on a sort of cliffhanger, and I suspected that Castle was due to get his you-know-what handed to him by Beckett. As it is, the first episode of Season 2 deals largely with Castle attempting to fix the damaged relationship between him and Beckett.<br /><br />When we first meet Rick Castle, he'd just killed off his literary cash cow, Derek Storm. Beckett inspires him to create a new protagonist (and I laughed out loud at the premise - \\"hooker by day, cop by night\\"), and part of the fun this season is in seeing Beckett so discomfited at being Castle's \\"muse.\\"<br /><br />CASTLE: THE COMPLETE FIRST SEASON collects all ten episodes on three discs.

B001P5HI4A|2.0|I distinctly remember walking out of this movie in multiplex (thank god for them!!) because of the mawkishness of the movie. Issac B. Singer, the original author of the story wrote a scathing review of this movie and one can see why.  Normally I like a lot of the songs of the Bergman's and Michel Legrand but there is not one single memorable show stopping tune in this whole movie like nothing like \\"On A Clear Day You Can See Forever\\", probably the last memorable Streisand musical since it was directed by the genius, Vicente Minnelli and scored by my favorite pop arranger, Nelson Riddle. If you can buy the premise of Streisand posing as man to impress a woman (Amy Irving who was nominated for a Razzie) then maybe you'll enjoy this movie. But as an ex-Streisand fan, I doubt it unless you're one of those fans who feel that Babs can do no wrong!!   I'm not sure which film is the worst Streisand has ever made, this one or the remake of \\"A Star is Born\\".
B000A2RRF4|5.0|I have most of Michael Jackson's Videos. Live in Bucharest is the one I have viewed the most. Although I love all his videos, this video makes me feel like I am one in the audience watching him on a live concert. There is quite an emotional response from the millions of fans attending the concert, responding to the meaning of his words- tears as well as enjoyment.   There is no doubt that Michael is truly loved by all his fans world wide. I love his other videos as well especially some of his songs that are not in this video.
0790732203|4.0|\\"Risky Business\\" is one of my favorite movies.  A story of a young guy coming of age. \\"Time of your life, kid?\\" But I think the plot is based more on capitalism, which has always been the basis of the American Dream. Joel and Barry try to create some kind of answering machine (or whatever that thing was) while his constantly horny friend Glenn askes him if he can borrow a room.  You can hear the noises coming from the bedroom upstairs while both Joel and Barry complain that they cannot concentrate. (Was something else on their minds?)    One of my favorite parts is when Joel asked his classmates at the cafeteria \\"Do we want to accomplish something or just make money?\\" and they say they just want to make money. \\"And you Joel?\\" and he responds \\"to serve my fellow mankind.\\" Then they throw what looks like french fries at him. Fun.    sg
0802130208|4.0|What an enjoyable tragicomic story of gargantuan (literally!) proportions. There are hints of realism creeping into the book here and there, but overall, there are so many things absurdly hilarious, bizarrely humorous that it's impossible to not enjoy this classic!
0767830555|5.0|When you mix a riveting script, with a blossoming director reaching his peak and the greatest actor of his generation, you get Taxi Driver. Robert DeNiro is spellbinding as Travis Bickle a ex-marine who gets a job as a new york taxi driver and dives into the depth of new york's urban decay. One of the best films of the 70's that stands the test of time; 5 stars.
B0024FADAQ|5.0|The Movie itself was exactly the same as the original - your probably saying well duh. I was expecting to see Will Wheaton in this version, but to no avail. I was kind of expecting to see some deleted scenes restored to no avail. All that was there was how the movie was made in 3 or 4 different ways. Not what I was looking for. But still a nice addition to my movie collection.
B002IR3PSC|5.0|I'm not exactly what you can say an orthodox fan of Jethro Tull, because I really don't like the poor quality sound that almost all the 60's and beggining of 70's studio versions have. Mid 70's recordings like \\"Thick As A Brick\\" album between others is a big exception (Thanks God!). I'm a Progressive Rock fan and that's why I'm always find myself giving me the chance to listen the productions of this band. Recently I have seen great nice surprises like the \\"Jack in the Green\\"... I thought that after the \\"A\\" album and Eddie Jobson's took off for best, JT wouldn't had a great keyboardist again, but I got impressed again with keyboardist PJ Vetesse for the \\"Broadsword & The Beast\\" album.<br /><br />After I read the inner book and saw this new JT DVD, I can say for sure that you will see the complete live version of the song \\"Thick As A Brick\\" between other music jems (including all the live recording problems that they had. For example the feedback whistle in the middle of the Flute solo improvization)... What a Wonderfull thing! just remember that one of the most pompus and spectacular thing of JT music is the \\"BURSTING OUT\\" CD (1978): My all time favorite Jethro Tull live CD recording (like the TWO FOR THE SHOW\\" KANSAS album, another of my all time live favorites). So I think that this \\"Live at Madison Square Garden\\" is be best of the best of all the essential Jethro Tull music material. I have waited a long time to see the complete version of the \\"Thick As A Brick\\" song and all the great songs of the totemic \\"Bursting Out\\" at the period of time where all this classic Tull songs were composed at the top of their capacities; but furthermore the extraordinary drumming of the underrated player Barriemore Barlow, the great gtr sound and solos of the guitarist Martin Barre and the excellent keyboard arrangements and crazy joy of John Evan... So, at last, you will enjoy a great video of one of the best Progressive rock moments in the history of Rock music, and what will be a \\"must-have\\" for fans or not fans!... so Good Luck!-have\\" for fans or not fans!... so Good Luck!
B002M3SOWO|5.0|I just finished reading The Last Olympian and WOW what a great ending to this incredible series by Rick Riordan.  I'm sad that this is the last book in the Percy Jackson and the Olympians seris as it has easily become my favorite book series.  All the books are amazing but this one was my favorite.  Now, all I have to look forward to is The Lightning Thief movie and the next Camp Half-Blood series.  Everyone BUY the book!!!  You won't be disappointed.

B002NXSRX4|4.0|When a director's crowning achievement was the first Mummy film, you know how high to set your expectations, but I am happy to say that this film is better than both the Mummy movies and Van Helsing by far. G.I. Joe: Rise of the Cobra is loud and the action never quits, but the sense of fun here is contagious. Unlike Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, this flick isn't a chore to sit through. Most of the acting is pretty good for this type of film and the CGI is top notch majority of the time. The action scenes also seemed really fresh and exciting, which is hard to do nowadays. On top of all that, Sienna Miller and Rachel Nichols are both super hot, which only makes every scene they are in that much better.<br /><br />I grew up playing with G.I. Joe action figures. In fact I still have boxes full of them up in the attic and numerous vehicles scattered about and tucked away somewhere in the house. While this movie didn't bring out the kid in me enough to bust out the figures one more time, I was entertained from start to finish. It's well worth seeing, just check your brain at the door and allow this flick to help you forget about your daily life for two hours. I know I did.<br /><br />3 and 1/2 out of 5 stars
068485743X|3.0|I purchased this book months ago and went through the chapters.  Yes, they do provide good insight on different areas of writing such as Style, Characterization, Progression, Dialogue, etc.  However, I would say that about 95% of the stuff this book told me was stuff that I already knew just from reading so many books (and I'm not talking about writing guides...I'm talking fiction novels).  If you're an avid reader, you naturally pick the proper technicalities of proper writing.  It starts to become natural to you.  So basically everything THE FIRST FIVE PAGES told me, I had already picked up just from reading novels.  This is a good book for those who are trying out writing for the first time and may not read as often.  However, reading lots of books is a learning tool in itself.
0156907399|5.0|Virginia Woolf's \\"To The Lighthouse\\" can be a difficult read, with its highly stylized stream-of-consciousness prose, but it is a rewarding one in the end, even if it seems that nothing much has happened over the course of the novel.  Despite taking place within a set period of time, from 1910-1920, the conflicts and themes presented transcend far beyond the scope of the novel.  \\"To The Lighthouse\\" is a unique standard bearer for early modern literature.<br /><br />To say that \\"To The Lighthouse\\" is a tale about the Ramsay family would be selling the book short.  While this family and their experiences are the core of the novel, Woolf delves into some heavy examination of the roles that males and females are meant to play in society.  Mrs. Ramsay is beloved by all for her extraordinary beauty, still evident in her fifties, but she is tied down by a demanding husband, eight very different children, and her own need to oversee every facet of people's lives.  Mr. Ramsay, a selfish philosopher, depends upon his wife to build his ego, no matter the expense or the damage caused to his children.  This examination of their lives takes place at their summer home on the Isle of Skye in Scotland with their various guests.  Woolf begins by painting a loving and generous portrait of the Ramsays (modeled upon her own parents) before moving the action of the novel ten years into the future after the family has experienced a few catastrophes that they struggle to get over.  The novel ends with the perspective of the outsiders, trying to make sense of what has been lost and what it means to life as a whole.<br /><br />Virgina Woolf was an exceptionally talented writer, able to make mundane details vivid and able to capture the intricacies of family life and marriage without seeming sentimental.  Her prose is poetic, following tangential thoughts to complete her circuitous paragraphs.  Woolf allows her readers insight into not only one family, but into situations that concern everyone; mortality, love, family, and one's legacy.  \\"To The Lighthouse\\" is a wonderful testament to Woolf's legacy as one of the premier authors of modern literature.ve, family, and one's legacy.  \\"To The Lighthouse\\" is a wonderful testament to Woolf's legacy as one of the premier authors of modern literature.
B002LVVCIK|3.0|Michael Moore's unique blend of populist politics and satirical humor has produced some impressive results in the past. But I found \\"Capitalism: A Love Story\\" to be only a partial success. The first half lacks focus, as Moore's tells some ancedotal stories about people who have been screwed over. They are moderately interesting and you do feel bad for the victims. But as an indictment of the entire capitalist system they fall far short. I think some sharper editing could have produced a tighter and more effective film    The second half picks up steam as Moore discusses the bank bailout, unions and the way that Reagan and both Bushes managed to \\"rig the game\\" in favor of the wealthy and powerful. He does attempt to offer a vision of a more just and equitable America, particularly in his discussion of FDR's \\"Second Bill Of Rights\\"(which was never passed by Congress). But I found his idea of replacing capitalism (an economic system) with democracy (a political system) entirely too vague to be useful. This is still a film worth seeing but not as good as Moore's best work.
0062515675|1.0|Started off very intruiging, kept wanting to know more ...got nothing. Very poor writing ability. I thought I was reading an elementry school kid's essay. Great ideas, should have pitched them to an actual writer who could have developed a story.     Here's what you're in for: (quoted from page 90)  \\"I still have much wisdom to share with you. Are you tired?\\"   \\"Not in the least. I actually feel pretty pumped up. You are quite the motivator, Julian. Have you ever thought about an infomercial?\\" I asked mischeviosly.  \\"I don't understand,\\" he replied gently.    Was the book written by a 10 year old, I pondered sincerely...
0545123267|5.0|Shiver is an absolutely gorgeous novel. I could go on and on about how wonderful it is, but I think it is better to keep it simple. I really enjoyed Stiefvater's first novel, Lament. I seriously didn't really think I would like Shiver better, but I have a whole different kind of respect for Stiefvater after reading this novel.  I fell in love with this book.<br /><br />I generally don't reread books, but Shiver is a book that I will definitely read again. The story is so beautifully told that I don't think I'll ever get tired of reading it.<br /><br />I suppose this is a human/werewolf love story, but it is so much more. I don't really feel comfortable classifying it this way because Shiver is so far from the stereotypical werewolf stories.<br /><br />Grace and Sam are an amazing leading duo. They complement each other perfectly; the reader can see why they fall in love with one another. I feel like it is hard to find that in character couples lately. I also love the fact that Sam is sensitive and not a bad boy. I generally am a sucker for the dark, brooding characters with hidden marshmallow centers, but Sam is such an obvious marshmallow and he's proud of it. I love that fact that he has a dark past, but he isn't dark... that is so rare to see!<br /><br />And the ending... loved it.

1906694176|4.0|I bought my hardback from Amazon.UK because I couldn't wait until next year to finish Stieg Larsson's Millenium Trilogy. The US publisher should move up their release date for this book, what the heck are they thinking?<br /><br />No spoilers here! At 600 pages it's a whopper. The first half of the book is filled with at least 6 different stories being told and is a little hard to follow, but hang in there. It's when the stories begim to cross each other that makes it hard to put the book down. When you get to the last 200 pages, it's just impossible to stop.  There are parts where the suspense builds and you get that awful feeling something really bad is going to happen. All in all, Larsson wraps his very feminist trilogy up nicely. I wasn't disappointed at all, only sad because that's all, folks.<br /><br />4 stars because I loved \\"Played with Fire\\" as a 5 star book. Larsson wrote Salander as a remarkable unapoligetic feminist hero, and there is more of her in \\"Fire\\" than \\"Tattoo\\" and \\"Hornet's Nest.\\"
0307588335|1.0|I worked at Lehman for a long time.  There's some factual content is this book, but on the whole it's comical.  A friend told me this guy spends every interview he does justifying his qualifications - because he has none.  I've almost finished another Lehman book  called \\"The Murder of Lehman.\\"  It's also written by an insider who despite hiding behind a pseudonym comes across as totally genuine.  Looking at the reviews for this book, it seems the high ratings are from people who don't know much about finance and are seduced by a book co-authored with a thriller writer.  For all you finance guys and anyone else who gave just 1 star or maybe 2, The Murder of Lehman should be a far more satisfying read.  I'm thinking five stars so far.  Of course, the bar has been set very low.  Still, I've got to say that the prologue is brilliant and is a story I did not know.  And the chapter on Lehman after 9/11 could only have been written by someone who was there.  I was, and found the chapter stirring.

B002KDUDG6|4.0|We are about to see what the real Buble is all about! Ever the romantic, Buble brings forth his most winning collection of love songs ever in this new album. You will find yourself caught up in the toe-tapping rhythm of his new single \\"Haven't Met You Yet\\", enthralled by the tender \\"Hold On\\" and delightfully surprised by his Elvis-like interpretation of \\"Heartache Tonight\\". Buble puts a unique twist on some old-style love songs that will capture the hearts of old and young alike.
B001AQTWF2|1.0|I love Whitney Houston. How could one not love someone with such an incredible gift? But that gift is no longer present in her current work, \\"I Look To You\\". I bought her last two albums \\"My Love Is Your Love\\" and \\"Just Whitney\\" when most gave it the thumbs down but I thought they were actually pretty decent. But this CD here is just the worst. This is a complete hot mess. The fact that Clive Davis and the media painted this as her comeback (her 3rd comeback if anyone has bothered to keep count) makes this that much sadder. Sure she looks beautiful on the cover and she's now free of Bobby (and the drugs?) but her voice is long long gone and the songs ALL sound dated. She struggles through most of the tracks and avoids all high notes whenever possible.     The first single \\"I Look To You\\" though the message behind it is beautiful is dreadful and when I played it at home for the first time my family wanted to know who was the old white male country singer I was listening to. I had to tell them it wasn't an old white male country singer, it was Whitney Houston!!! Now you know something is horribly wrong when your voice is so far gone people are now confusing it for that of an old white male country singer. It's a darn shame. \\"Million Dollar Bill\\" is suppose to be this big hit but it sounds like something Whitney stole from some long forgotten 1970's soul act and is trying to pass it off as new school. Songs like \\"Call You Tonight\\" are so elementary that I wonder how they even made it on the record. \\"A Song For You\\" would've been amazing had it been sung and not talked in a song-like way (if that makes any sense). And as other reviewers have stated there is no reason for this album to sound so dated like it does. Whoever was responsible for the writing and producing of this material must not have their ears to the street OR the radio because this stuff is so off the mark with today's popular music. This CD doesn't represent the present or future - it's the past and thatis where it should have stayed, in the past. Even on a track like \\"Salute\\" which is the closest we get to a song sounding the least bit fresh and edgy, Whitney seems out of her element and can't pull off the youthful spirit sounding tired instead. The only reason I could see why this CD hit #1 was due to all the initial hype because it really lacks any kind of substance or genuine soul. I'm going to hope and pray that on her next album Whitney will finally get her comeback (which at that time would be her 4th attempt) because this comeback was a major flop. No one wants to see Whitney fail but releasing such a poor record is unacceptable.         Download: \\"I Didn't Know My Own Strength\\" - The lone exceptional, beautifully done track on this misguided, overly-hyped CD.    Listen To: \\"Like I Never Left\\" - This smooth jam reveals a calm, cool, and collected Whitney amongst the mess.

B001TOD92C|5.0|This is a slice of life film - truly a gem, about a man that is not full of self pity.  Ram has made bad choices and as he says himself, \\"burned the candle at both ends.\\"  This isn't a movie about wrestling, or a champ overcoming all odds a la \\"Rocky.\\"  People do age, some well and some not so well.  There are poor people living in trailer parks and mothers that choose to make their living in strip clubs. People living paycheck to paycheck.  The film shows these things, not particularly negative but as a fact of life.  For the viewer that wants a Hollywood ending, perhaps this film isn't for you. Mickey Rourke is superb and beyond amazing, vulnerable but not maudlin - he took my breath away. The rest of the actors are right on target. Marisa Tomei is beautifully cast as the potential love interest. A great movie!
B0013JG7IQ|5.0|Based on Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's final opera, \\"Die Zauberflote,\\" renowned actor-writer-director Kenneth Branagh's film is a visual wonder and a musical triumph in every sense of the words.Sadly, this beautiful movie is not available in Region 1, but it should be seen everywhere, and appreciated. For me, it off-sets the semi-disappointment I feel of his remake of \\"Sleuth.\\" The acting, cinematography and everything else was top-notch. I highly recommend this movie, and would rate it PG for mild violence, both war-related and comic. I have a feeling that Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart would be proud of this film version of one of his most popular operas.

B002S0OBFK|5.0|There's no studio logo when the film begins, and there are no opening credits. There's only a title card thanking the families of Micah Sloat and Katie Featherston for their cooperation. We then go back to the fall of 2006 and see home video footage of Micah prepping the camera just as Katie pulls into the driveway of their San Diego home. Strange things have been going on in the house as they sleep, and they want to capture it on film. A psychic is invited over, and only then do we learn that strange things have been happening to Featherston pretty much her entire life. Is she being followed by some supernatural force? If so, what does it want with her? The psychic makes it clear that his area of expertise is ghosts, which won't do much good for Featherston since it seems she has more of a demon problem.    This is the basic scenario of \\"Paranormal Activity,\\" the most inventive and frightening horror movie of recent memory. Presenting itself as a documentary consisting of raw footage, it works not as a gory, over the top camp fest but as a slow, disturbing unfolding of events. It utilizes unnerving subtleties like phantom scratching noises, mysterious thuds, unexplained shadows, and lights that turn on and off completely on their own. The more overt visual scares come with no explanations for how or why they occur. It's not about what you see, but about what you don't see. Made on a budget of just $15,000, shot in just seven days in a real house without a crew, and released almost entirely through word-of-mouth and internet campaigns, \\"Paranormal Activity\\" may someday be regarded as one of the scariest movies ever made.    Most of the terror is reserved for long, mostly uninterrupted shots of the couple sleeping in their bedroom. At first, we only hear strange noises that don't seem to be coming from anywhere. As the film progresses, stranger, more intense things happen. The door forcefully slams shut, after which we hear loud knocking. Footsteps trail through thebedroom. The bed sheets lift and lower completely on their own. At one point, Featherston awakens, gets out of bed, and just stands there staring at Sloat for the next couple of hours (shown in high speed). When noises wake both of them up, they search the upstairs hallways and discover that the overhead passage to the attic has been opened. What do you think Sloat will find when he goes up to investigate?    Wikipedia defines home as \\"a place of residence or refuge and comfort.\\" Unlike films such as \\"The Blair Witch Project,\\" in which the terror is distantly located in the middle of the woods, \\"Paranormal Activity\\" takes place in a familiar environment where one is supposed to feel safe and secure from the outside world. The greatest terror is in knowing that your place of residence or refuge and comfort is in fact no such place; rather, it's a place a fear. So many primal fears are exploited in this film--fear of the dark, fear of the unknown, fear of helplessness and isolation, fear of exposure--and yet they're never reduced to the level of cheap thrills. Sitting in the theater, I can't guarantee that you will watch in helpless fascination, as you may keep covering your eyes in anticipation of something dreadful happening. What I can guarantee is that you will be genuinely afraid.    That being said, this movie probably wouldn't have worked were it not for Sloat and Featherston (the actors, not the characters they play). Together, they make a convincing young couple. Even more convincing, however, is the way they react separately to the escalating supernatural events. Sloat initially doesn't take anything that happens too seriously, although he does seem enthusiastic about having a camera in the house. Only later, when things go from bad to worse, does he find himself in a power struggle with the entity stalking his girlfriend. There are times when he tries to be the dominant and protective male, claiming that he has the wherewithal to save his girlfriend; in truth, he has never had any control of the situation. Featherton is physically and psychologically more vulnerable, well aware that her past is catching up with her, frustrated at the willfulness and skepticism of her boyfriend. Their believability is a credit to first-time director Oren Peli, who opted not to have them recite scripted lines of dialogue.    The film ends exactly the same way it began: Without any credits. The only thing we get is yet another title card, and this time, I won't reveal what it says. I will say that the shot leading up the title card is the most chilling one I've seen since the slow, agonizing close up of Justin Long's head at the end of \\"Jeepers Creepers.\\" I have a feeling that the success of \\"Paranormal Activity\\" will continue to mount, relying not on studio enforced tactics but on audience reaction, the most authentic promotion there is for a movie. Just as it should be--this is an astonishing achievement, not merely as a story, but as an exercise in pacing, atmosphere, and apprehension. A word of warning: It earns the right to be called a horror movie, so if you don't like being scared, you should definitely stay away.

0060765380|1.0|Without counting pages, 20% is my point of no return when reading a book, no matter how bad it is.     I had to force my self to read 75% of this book before I walked it to the nearest trash can and didn't look back. I forced myself because I like reading and to be honest I am a paperback junkie. If I had to rely on TV for entertainment I would be a salad.      The writing is excruciatingly hokey and rediculous - a character is repeatedly referred to as \\"The Bastard\\". I could not decide what the book wanted to be: Espionage, science fiction, a Michael Crichton ripoff or the \\"Davinci Copy\\".     Cliches are amok. Bio terror and plague. Everyone flying around the world arrving on-site armed to the teeth. Secret organizatons, The Vatican, squid bacteria creating night-light people who must be eaten, The requisite Secret Island, kinapping, Asian asassins and a cannibal army.     But I really did learn an interesting thing about a parasite and an ant. Had to look it up.  Probably the best part of the book and it was only a paragraph.    Plenty of novels are rediculous. I really like Lawrence Sanders' character Archibald McNally and Tim Dorsey's Serge.    I think if you like the combination of Robert Ludlum, Dan Brown, Michael Crichton and maybe Tom Clancy-Light then this is a book for you. Otherwise, keep walking when you get to the \\"Authors RO-SO\\" aisle of the book store.

B000ETQRCM|5.0|Not 10 , not even VS, but this release has faster pace to it than anything since Vitology. Comparable to the Yield album. But, not as good as Ten or Vs. The album songs display a sense of maturity, something different in general, and a bit grown up in mood. It's as if they suddenly settled down with a need to go back to their real roots of rebellious ecstatic uplifting tunes of grunge. Perhaps, a realization of what really works for them, doesn't necessarily work for their listeners. All in all an awesome piece of work. Going back on tour probably helped alot as well.
B0014Z4ON4|3.0|First, this is a good action flick for when you are bored.  It has all the basics any would find in the adventure genre.        Unfortunately, some of the first \\"1\\" score reviews reflected some of my concerns.  I would suggest approaching this movie as a fiction and based on an individual group of villains, as opposed to the entirety of the worship populace of their goddess.  Not only is the depiction of Shiva being a God of Light figure and Kali being a demonic goddess inaccurate to the views of their religion, people still have this tendency to believe these stories reflect the culture.  Consequently, I warn against this.  When I watched the movie, the Thugee controversy was the least of concern when I saw what people were having for dinner in the film.  In some ways I actually  cannot blame people for thinking it negatively portrayed South Asians.      That aside, I had other critiques.  The female lead, while played well, was not my ideal character.  I also thought Lucas could have written a better movie if he actually made it like he did with Star Wars (which redeemed him in the end, as far as I am concerned).  The story would have been better if it was deliberately portrayed as being based off a myth made by him and inspired by Hinduism, as opposed to have been based off what was already established (albeit with the addendum of negative colonial propaganda and orientalism).  Not only would this remove some cultural representation (or misrepresentation) concerns, but it would emphasize his strengths.      If one can take this as what it is - a fiction - and try not to judge South Asians based on this film, I say this is a good film to watch for what it is.  I personally preferred the other Indiana Jones movies for what they had to offer as far as content goes.  I just would not would not call every German a racist Nazi (who even they had their heroes who opposed the inhumane ones).
0385504225|3.0|Like others, I anxiously awaited Dan Brown's much-hyped new release.  After reading it, I have to say that I was under-whelmed.  The story never did click for me.  'Lost Symbol' was not on the same par as 'Angels and Demons' or 'DaVinci Code'.  Maybe I expected to much from Dan Brown.  But the next time he releases a new title, I think I'll wait until after it's reviewed before I buy it.  I certainly won't pre-order one of his books again.

B001PA0FFO|3.0|The Bottom Line:    Doubt works much better in its quiet moments (Viola Davis's scene springs to mind) when it eschews the thundering acting that works better on the boards than on the screen; the film is still worth seeing due to the convincing nature of the performances (exception: a weak Amy Adams) and several worthwhile scenes, but this trivial piece of Oscar-bait will not be remembered for very long.    2.5/4
B0025KVLTC|5.0|The creative breakthrough The Beatles made between 'Help' and 'Rubber Soul' pales in comparison to the extraordinary artistic leap that occured with 'Revolver'. While 'Rubber Soul' represented a clear broadening and maturing of the band's sound, it was still predominantly within the realm of pop/rock music and boy-girl relationships. In contrast, 'Revolver' incorporates musical styles such as soul, classical, psychadelia and Indian music, while the lyrics cover everything from personal taxation to achieving a higher state of Being. The album also represents a huge breakthrough in terms of studiocraft; 'Revolver' was apparently the first album where The Beatles were afforded decent time in the studio, and it shows. The chaotic soundscape 'Tomorrow Never Knows' is the most obvious example, but the more complicated, ambitious arrangements and exquisitely detailed vocal harmonies are evident in nearly every song.       'Taxman': biting, angry rocker that sees Harrison cynically sneering \\"I'm the taxman/and you're working for no-one but me\\". Highlights include the call-and-response bridge and crunching lead guitar solo (played by McCartney).    'Eleanor Rigby': exceptional ballad, but surprisingly intense and downbeat for a single.  McCartney's lament for \\"all the lonely people\\" is accompanied by a string octet, with no instrumental contribution from The Beatles at all (although they do contribute vocal harmonies in the chorus).     'I'm Only Sleeping': Lennon composition accurately evokes the feelings of tiredness and laziness, with its leisurely pace, weary-sounding vocals, yawns, and end-of-verse bass runs. The instrumental bridge and fade-out famously features psychadelic-sounding backwards guitar effects.     'Love You To': The first of Harrsion's take-it-or-leave-it Indian compositions. Driven by sitar and tabla, it's effectively a Harrison solo piece. Not my personal cup of tea, but I can appreciate its influence on World Music and \\"raga-rock\\".     'Here, There And Everywhere': outstanding McCartney ballad, one of the best and most under-rated Beatles songs. One of the simpler tunes here arrangement-wise, featuring one of McCartney's most tender vocals, and once again a superb harmony backing.    'Yellow Submarine': probably the most well-known song here, this singalong is the perfect vehicle for Ringo. At first, the kiddie-friendly style seems a bit out of place among the more mature songs on 'Revolver'. But the studio effects designed to imitate captain's orders, ship engines, and whistles are another example of the band's growing experimentation.    'She Said, She Said': almost paranoid, drug-influenced hard rocker by Lennon that reminds me a little of 'Rain'. Apparently referencing a conversation during a bad trip, the song features excellent guitar work, an unusual shift into the bridge, and a spiralling round-like fadeout.    'Good Day Sunshine': bouncy, jaunty \\"I'm in love and it's a sunny day!\\" singalong by McCartney. The honky-tonk piano in the bridge gives the song a 1920's feel, and the vocal twists and harmonies are again a highlight. Like 'She Said', the song fades out on a round-like rotation of the chorus.     'And Your Bird Can Sing': Lennon basically disowned this rocker, but it is an outstanding and under-rated song. Lyrically it appears to be a quirky, tounge-in-cheek take on a boy/girl relationship, although it could also be  straight Lennon nonsense. Fairly straightforward compared to some other songs on the album, but featuring very detailed, intricate guitar runs from Harrison.     'For No One': another great McCartney ballad, probably paling only in comparison to 'Eleanor Rigby' and 'Here, There..'. Effectively a McCartney solo piece, his description of a failed relationship is accompanied by a piano and French horn. McCartney apparently pushed the horn beyond its normal range to provide an appropriate sentimental complement to the song.     'Doctor Robert': something of a throwaway by Lennon, arguably the most straightforward 'rock' song here. McCartney does a great job with very raw, bluesy backing vocals in places.     'I Want To Tell You': a very under-rated Harrison song, driven by spiralling guitar riff and bouncy piano. The upbeat, singalong style contrasts with the insecure lyrics. Again, features excellent and detailed vocal harmonies, particularly on the fade-out.    'Got To Get You Into My Life': infectious soul-influenced number featuring a prominent brass section. In typical soul style, McCartney's vocals really let rip in the single-line chorus. A highlight for me is the short but intense guitar riff just before the fade-out.    'Tomorrow Never Knows': the most ambitious, experimental and downright weird song here. Lennon's philosophical lyrics (taken from the Tibetan Book Of The Dead) are swamped by droning guitar and organ lines, distrubing sound effects, Leslie speakers and tape loops, apparently all designed to mimic the effect of chanting monks. One of the key psychadelic songs, this brilliant but bizzare song re-inforces the experimental nature of the entire album.    If you consider that 'Sgt Pepper' is mainly a consolidation of these experiments rather than an artistic breakthrough in its own right, you could argue that 'Revolver' is The Beatles' best album. Certainly, in terms of a deliberate redifining of the band's sound, ambition and (most importantly) image, it can be regarded as their most significant.
B00003CXBK|5.0|First off, I have to say that I am not a big fan of anime, both movies and TV series. Most of them are incredibly over-the-top, some are just plain strange, a lot of them are style-over-substance, and many of them have characters that are WAY too sexual in terms of appearance. The plots themselves are odd to begin with; most of which are as bad as those that we find in more recent cartoons here in the United States. The craze that surrounds these anime films and shows are just wild; it's almost unbelievable. I do respect that other people love these forms of entertainment, but to me, anime is not, and has not been, my thing.<br /><br />...Why are you rechecking my last name?...<br /><br />Well anyway, there are some few animes that I really admire, and Princess Mononoke is one of them. This is one of the fewest animated films in which it's targeted at an older audience. It's not a family film: it has blood and no childish humor. It has a strong message: it focuses on humanity and how it's destroying the natural and spiritual side of the world. It is never over-the-top: no quick, colorful shots or strange techno music whatsoever. It's a classic in its genre, and it's Miyazaki's greatest creation, in my opinion. If you're tired of the Akira-like flashy lights, or lack of logic a la Bleach, or maybe even the Pokemon-like cuteness that you find in many children's anime, then Princess Mononoke can be the perfect alternative.<br /><br />Mind you, though, that even though I see this as one of the greatest anime films ever created, it's not one of my top favorites. I did find the film a bit slow in some parts, and there were some moments about environmentalism that felt too preachy. And San was very annoying in some scenes. I just wished she could be quiet when the film goes on. But those are all the flaws that I can find, and they really are few. Princess Mononoke is, without any doubt whatsoever, one of the greatest animated films to ever come from Japan, and is one of the greatest in general. Kudos to Miyazaki for creating this gem.udos to Miyazaki for creating this gem.
B000B5XOXY|2.0|Batman, what happened? This film and its sequel are classic examples of when the studio gets involved. After the breakout success and positive reviews of the first film, which was dark and moody, the sequel was given mixed reviews but was still a success. Just not as big as the first. Burton did have a story treatment in mind for a third film, coincidentally also involving the Riddler, but Warners didn't want him to return. Instead, we get Joel Schumacher, who claimed he's wanted to do an adaptation of Batman: Year One and claims to be a fan of the character. In my opinion, if this was so, he wouldn't have put nipples on the Bat-suit (saying he was inspired by statues of the Greek gods) and, even though he probably was pressured into it, making the film more like the 60s Adam West series (though a favorite of mine, in this day and age, the campy image cannot work). I do like Val Kilmer as Batman/Bruce Wayne, as we actually get to see more of Wayne outside the costume and his emotional struggle to have a romance with Nicole Kidman. Chris O'Donnell wouldn't have been my first choice to play Robin. He complains to much and comes across more as a brat. And when he's trying to leave Wayne Manor after Gordon leaves him there, Wayne is practically begging Grayson to stay (no offense to anyone but Batman and Robin have been trying to escape the whole gay thing since the 1950s and putting that kind of innudendo and having a gay director at the helm doesn't help the matter). Billy Dee Williams' (who played Harvey Dent in the first film) has been paid off (a clause in his contract stated he could return as Two-Face) and is replace by Tommy Lee Jones, who plays the character way over the top. This is where the animated version tops live-action. The characterization (again Jones played him over the top but the script is to blame as well), is way off; referring to himself in the plural and repeatedly flipping his coin to get the result he wants instead of being psychologically bound to what the coin lands on. Jim Carrey, though a favorite actor of mine, doesn't work as the Riddler for me. Again, this is where the animated version tops live-action. Riddler comes across as a carbon-copy of the Joker. Instead of playing the animated version/comics version of a subtly psychotic criminal genius who can't help himself but leave riddles to his crimes, we pretty much get Frank Gorshin's interpretation; a highly-energetic giggling \\"menace\\" (though Gorshin's version was clearly more insane than Carrey's, just listen to that laugh). And Riddler's scheme comes across as something the Mad Hatter would do. If I had done this film, Riddler would've been the established criminal and Mad Hatter would've been the obsessed Wayne Enterprises employee (much like his B:TAS debut episode minus being obsessed Wayne). Nicole Kidman is alright as Chase Meridian (and I can actually believe her as a doctor and I like better in this as this was before she became an over-rated Oscar-winning actor), but she keeps on jumping back and forth between Bruce and Batman. In the first two films, Vicki Vale was attracted to Bruce and Catwoman was attracted to both. I don't think a doctor would have that much fixation. Michael Gough is still good as Alfred and Pat Hingle is actually in this movie! The story is OK but I think they could've done better. Two-Face's attack on Batman in the Batmobile makes no sense as it doesn't add to the story (just an excuse to show some explosions and the car driving up the wall) and a lot of stuff (like the Sonar suit [which, for a prototype, doesn't do anything], Bat-Wing and Bat-Boat) come across as nothing more than toy advertisements. The production design of this movie is terrible! While Burton's design had more style, this is blown out of proportion. With Burton, Gotham was a dark, mysterious city that Batman could work in and use to his advantage. In this, Gotham is lit up like a Christmas tree and you can see Batman coming for miles away,especially in the Batmobile. Now to the music, Elliot Goldenthal me-wait a minute! Elliot Goldenthal? Why does that name sound famil-oh my God! Its the man who screwed up the Beatles! So we meet again Mr. Goldenthal, what kind of musical travesty do you have in \\"score\\" for us this time? Well for starters, he throws out his musical superior's (Danny Elfman) classic theme which can be interpreted as heroic and dark and we get...a theme that's not as memorable. In fact his score is anything but memorable. He just composed a few pieces of music and then tracked his music for the rest of the film. Well, below-par music for a sub-par film.especially in the Batmobile. Now to the music, Elliot Goldenthal me-wait a minute! Elliot Goldenthal? Why does that name sound famil-oh my God!

6305744793|5.0|When first seeing this movie, you will tell that it's not very close to the 60's TV series. It's darker and far more wicked. I think it's because the creators of this movie wanted to be more faithful to the original cartoons created by Charles Addams. But whatever the reason, this film is dark, gothic, and very wicked. And I love every minute of it. The entire film reminds me of Tim Burton's works because of the creepy and gloomy atmosphere, and for its very dark humor. It's a very gothic presentation of one of the most wicked families that people know and love. I'm sure that fans of the original TV series will not be disappointed in this [original Charles Addams] take on the Addams Family.
0783225547|4.0|Despite its conformity to the conventions governing volcano pictures,  the film makes for pleasant viewing. There are no real villains in the piece, lots of fireworks, and an attractive cast. The director fits the piece together nicely, avoiding too great an emphasis on pseudo-scientific explanation,  and letting us see Pierce Brosnan and Linda Hamilton in various stances. Should appeal to most members of the family without creating difficulties over language or behavior (save for some minor  expletives). Well done entry in the genre.

B000092ZYX|4.0|Hail to the Thief being Radiohead's 6th studio album and their 2003 release was met with positive reviews by the critics and did also very well with the general public. Allmusic, IGN and Pitchfork Media all gave it high marks. The album reached nr 1 in the UK and nr 3 in the US. Three singles were released on this album. These being, i.e., \\"There There\\", \\"Go to Sleep\\" and \\"2 + 2 = 5\\". All the lyrics are included in the booklet and we also get a personnel list that lists what they played. 4/5.
B002KDUDG6|2.0|On the heels of Streisand's new release, I was like \\"Oooooo Buble is out with a new album!\\" I must say, I've listened to this album quite a few times I still don't get it. The opening number as BOLD as it is sounds like it would work beautifully for the vocals of Dame Shirley Bassey, but I don't understand WHY it was made all big and bold for Michael's take on it. As the closing number, 'Stardust' gets a very crowded sounding treatment with Naturally 7. Buble has an amazing voice. If Stardust had to be done a capella, perhaps there could have been vocal overdubs? The list of songs performed are a great idea, the treatments however are not that interesting.<br /><br />Call Me Irresponsible was a fantastic album, this new one just didn't grab me like the previous album did.
B0000062S0|3.0|Walking Into Clarksdale being Page and Plante's 1998 and is a ordinary rock album with very generic lyrics and sound. The album was met with ok reviews and Allmusic gave the album 3.5/5. I think this is a tad generous since it sounds like any other rock album and the sound and lyrics deserve more 3/5. Apparently the album only took 35 days to record and it feels rushed and they could have spent another 35 days to create better lyrics and sound. This feels rushed. The booklet also feels rushed. No lyrics and a few photographs that look like friends took them in the studio. 3/5.

B0029LHW4U|5.0|It's back to business as usual for the rest of the band, which is truly a good thing.  They managed to reproduce a very high level of their craft without Layne Staley.  While he was a key member of the band, this album proves that they can produce quality work without him.  I thoroughly enjoyed this album, and believe it deserves a full five stars.  If you are a fan of Alice In Chains' signature sound, check out this album, and you will likely find more material to love.  Do not fear a pathetic attempt to capture the trademark Alice In Chains sound, it has been captured in full effect.  Just pop it in and press play!  You are in for a treat.
B001NU4CDM|5.0|Update: Recently I freshened up my collection by getting the CD version of this album. With Amazon's Autorip sending a copy directly to my cloud I found myself discovering &#34;The Grand Illusion&#34; anew and enjoying it as much as I had when it was on the charts.<br /><br />A re-examination brought an interesting discovery to me. Styx was a pop/rock band with the flavor of progressive rock, but a new hearing with more experienced ears brings it home to me that Dennis DeYoung was the one who primarily gave Styx the prog flavor that differentiated the band. The synthesizers are sometimes a bit flowery but they are solidly in keeping with musical threads of the times, e.g. Starcastle, Yes, I don't know, maybe even Klaatu.<br /><br />Having enjoyed rediscovering this album I've sampled newer works by DeYoung and Styx. It is that two teaspoons of prog and a dash of drama that make the classic Styx albums distinctive. DeYoung revives that approach on a solo album, &#34;One Hundred Years&#34;, while the remaining bandmembers have settled squarely into midwestern rock. Dennis DeYoung still sings with clear articulation but now has a more natural delivery.<br /><br />Original review:<br />As time has moved on, my taste has as well. But when I was in my late teens Styx delivered the goods and &#34;Grand Illusion&#34; was the best of their albums that I'd heard. If Styx appeals to your taste I have no doubt that you'll like every song on this album; don't waste your time doing individual downloads, just get the entire album.<br /><br />With the addition of the unpretentious vocals of Tommy Shaw, Styx was the rare band that had no fewer than three lead singers, a key ingredient necessary to prevent fan burnout. I don't know about you but when a band has only one singer, I can usually hang in there for a few albums but after that I just grow weary of them. Bands like the Beatles, the Bangles, and Styx who have three or more singers, or Supertramp and Simon & Garfunkel with two lead vocalists...the sharing of the microphone can really give a band longevity provided their songwriting continues to hold up.<br /><br />James Young's big turn in the spotlight was the rocker &#34;Miss America&#34;. As a vocalist he wouldn't necessarily carry an entire band by himself but he was able to provide a talk-sing delivery that epitomized power rock vocals. Your mileage may vary but his guitar-rocker, with backing vocals that almost reminded me of Flo and Eddie at times, was my favorite Styx song. Over time I've found that Dennis DeYoung's vocals have moved from mannered to ripe for satire for me, but I recognize that this wouldn't be an issue for Styx's core audience. He certainly is able to belt out a song with ample drama, a talent that undoubtedly helped Styx wow arenas back in the day.<br /><br />Although Styx was never a &#34;progressive rock&#34; band, they toyed with elements that lent themselves to that feel without the overhead of the &#34;look ma, no hands!&#34; instrumental showboating that made so many prog-rock bands so embarrassing. For that reason, the two songs that get the least airplay, &#34;Castle Walls&#34; and &#34;Man In The Wilderness&#34; have had the most longevity for me. Both create an atmosphere, and like prog, both linger long beyond the usual three minute mark typical of the era's AM radio hits.<br /><br />Whenever I found an album this strong I would inevitably buy a couple more from the band's catalog in hopes of repeating the experience. &#34;Crystal Ball&#34; did nothing for me, &#34;Equinox&#34; had its moments, but &#34;Grand Illusion&#34; was the supernova that eclipsed both of those put together.<br /><br />Styx has certainly taken a beating from self-important critics who got their albums for free, whose writing had little to do with helping you determine whether an album was worth its cost. Rather, the critics who took Styx to task tended to be politically motivated, seeing mainstream acts like Styx as an obstacle to airplay for some personal favorite cult band of the day. They believed that if they could only bash mainstream acts enough, perhaps the public would discard them and succumb to the advocacy of the almighty &#34;expert&#34;. To some degree it worked; there have always been centerless teens willing to make excuses for the shortcomings of some act or another that heavily depended upon glam, fashion, and subculture peer pressure to maintain their pitiful level of sales. It gave kids the delusion that they were part of some scene. Phht. Any cult favorite can dish out a good song or two but in retrospect, stripped of all the hype, most of the acts with weak vocalists or budget production or spotty songwriting got the sales they deserved.

So whenever you hear a critic level the accusation &#34;faceless&#34; against Styx or other 70s acts, know that it's an indicator that the critic isn't focused on the music; they're obsessed with finding a celebrity object of worship, some star-spangled front man or woman that they can idolize.

0385504225|5.0|After reading a few of the other reviews of Dan Brown's latest offering, The Lost Symbol, I was confused and began wondering if some of these people read the same book I did.  In all honesty, I found it to be an incredible feat of thematic storytelling, blending all of the elements that made The DaVinci Code such a sensational success with a riveting new tale centered in the Capitol of The United States.<br /><br />Brown's ability to seamlessly weave historical fact with a fictional tale that is so realistic that you find yourself questioning where the line actually is between what is true and what is invention.  That ability is a rare talent that Brown has obviously mastered in this most current work.<br /><br />Written as a disconnected sequel to The DaVinci Code, The Lost Symbol follows the Indiana Jones-like journey of Robert Langdon as he scours the land and landmarks of present-day Washington D.C. in a rapidly accelerating quest to solve a mysterious Masonic puzzle.  It's fast-moving and, at times, simply amazing in the revelations that are uncovered; Many of which are based in fact.  The story itself is mesmerizing, although it does follow the same basic literary formula as Brown's preceding works.  However, that fact does not detract from the story in any way and, in fact, emphasizes Brown's signature style.  If you're a fan of his previous BOOKS (not the watered-down film versions), then you're sure to love this latest installment of the continuing adventures of Robert Langdon.<br /><br />Regarding the negative reviews, I certainly respect the opinions of others, provided they explain their point of view and not just spit out some mindless blather about how \\"it sucked\\" or \\"it's just like the DaVinci Code\\".  For the masses that enjoyed Brown's previous work, The Lost Symbol is a clear winner.
0312427999|3.0|If you must read this as I unfortunately did (audio download), please, please, read some Friedman too, or at the very least a synopsis of his works and ideas.  He and his ideas are most grossly misrepresented by Klein.  Yes, Friedman consulted for Pinochet's economic ministers briefly and gave them some ideas on how to liberalize markets (to try to fight the hyperinflation started by Pinochet), but he was not in any way complicit with Pinochet's repressive techniques!  On the contrary, Friedman saw the implementation in Chile of his recommendations as a means for undermining Pinochet's tyrannical regime!  Klein's inference that Friedman's ideas and Pinochet's despotic actions and policies in Chile were even remotely compatible or synthesized in parallel are laughable, and some simple fact-checking and a look into the chronology of events will quickly show the sloppy and shameful liberties she has taken.      I have given 3 stars only because I completely agree with the concept that people and parties take advantage of crises (in the name of self interest, or to further the greater good, or for a whole spectrum of reasons in between).  Obviously crises present wonderful opportunities to fix broken systems in the hope of preventing such future crises.  Witness the probable and imminent worldwide reforms to financial systems in response to last autumn's financial crisis.  But to suggest that greedy corporatists are slowly changing the world in their favor, one crisis at a time, insults even one's most basic abilities to observe and analyze.  The economy and it's infinite mechanisms and machinations are undergoing a great restructuring and reordering.  Yes, there will certainly be some who take an immoral advantage of this situation, and unfortunately this will also include tendencies to try to increase government and bureaucratic control over the economy, but the net result will be an overall moral improvement over the previous shortcomings.

B002EE583O|2.0|The other reviewers (so far) have provided a great summary of the historical significance of this album and much-improved sound-quality of this reissue. However, I find the omission of the finished version of 'Elephant Stone' from ALL versions of this 20th Anniversary 'Legacy' campaign to be downright mean-spirited. I don't know who is to blame... the artist or the label... but either way, I think it is just a cruel poke in the eye to long-time fans and collectors.    I understand and sympathize that some artists have a desire to restore their work to its 'pure' form, that is, to strip away things (in this case, songs) that were forcibly inserted by their labels to show the record-buying public that they would get extra value by spending extra cash on the CD version rather than the cheaper LP or cassette versions. A notorious example was the original tacking-on of 'Perfect' at the end of The The's Soul Mining... which was then dropped when the album was reissued earlier this decade in order to conform to Matt Johnson's original intention for the album to end with the epic 'Giant.' However, what steamed me about taking a personal favorite like 'Perfect' away is the fact that it was offered nowhere else in remastered form, except for in an (IMO) inferior earlier 7\\" single version on the 45RPM collection.    The Stone Roses and/or their label do the same to us here by stripping 'Elephant Stone' from the track list. I'm fully aware that 'Elephant Stone' was a single predating the album (in fact, as a college radio DJ back then, the 12\\" release got spun to death on my show for many, many months before the full LP was released). But why does that matter? The US CD version of this album that I've owned and loved for the past 20 years always had 'Elephant Stone' as Track 3. I never knew this album any other way. And what is truly bizarre is that the single 'Fools Gold' was another tack-on, but for some reason DOES find its way onto this reissue as a 'Bonus Track' (thank goodness!). If 'Fools Gold' can be a bonus track, why not 'Elephant Stone'!?    Nick Cave apparently suffered the same problem with unwanted extra tracks on the CD versions of his albums in the 80s. The current reissue campaign for his work follows the 'take-away' approach as well. Perhaps anticipating some outcry about that, the label did see fit to include (inexplicably!) low-bitrate MP3s of the excised tracks on the accompanying DVDs. While that is a less-than-perfect solution... at least it's something. But here, with all the time & material that obviously went into remastering and putting together this otherwise excellent Stone Roses package, they couldn't even find a way to make room for 'Elephant Stone'? Or at least give you an access code to download a high-bitrate MP3 of a remastered version of the song (as The Feelies have done with their recent reissues)?    I guess they wanted to leave something for the 30th Anniversary edition to entice us to buy it all over again... again. Ugh.
B002Q63JEU|2.0|I am going to keep this short. The album is a decent attempt, but alas sounds the same. I have been listening to Paramore sine their very first EP and since then I have bought the albums as they came. This one will be the exception. Over the last albums (Riot and this one), the band has been attempting to change their sound, but has only really managed to change how their drummer (Zac Farro) and lead guitarist/back-up vocalist (Josh Farro) sound. Hayley Williams voice however, has changed very little when listening to the past albums. Props for her new lyrical content and a ever so slight change in voice, but I think this album is receiving way too much credit. There are a few stand out tracks as always, but the rest are quite repetitive. Go for the darker sound girl! You sounded better with it! If you are a hard core Paramore fan, then buy it. If you were really looking for a sweet new sound, uh, well good luck.
B0029LHW4U|5.0|This is the album I've been waiting and hoping for.  Alice in Chains was one of my mainstays growing up and with their last release in 95 when I was still in High School, its been a LONG time since AIC fed the thirsty fans. Obviously, Layne Staley's death was largely responsible for the extended hiatus, and I am EXTREMELY stoked they decided to carry on.  I feel 14 years is respectful enough and its time for the talented musicians of this band to start kicking some ass again.  I really don't see the problem some people have with AIC existing without Staley.  Yes, Staley was a huge force behind Alice in Chains as ONE of the founding members.  However, this is just as much Jerry Cantrell's band.  A review I read stated that this album is like Nirvana going on without Kurt Cobain.  OK, Nirvana WAS truly Kurt Cobain.  Cobain and Novoselic formed the band, and it became Cobain.  He was the voice and soul of that group.  With Alice in Chains, the voice and soul were Layne Staley and Jerry Cantrell.  Staley struggled with drug addiction and withdrew quite a bit near the end of his run.  Listen to AIC's last self titled album and you hear mostly Cantrell's voice.  This reminds me somewhat of Pink Floyd where Syd Barret, their iconic lead singer, spiraled out of control and became a burden to the band, despite his brilliance.  The other members very grudgingly decided to part ways with Syd and carried on to become an infamous band while constantly respecting and memorializing Syd's influence.  Similar deal here.  To say Alice in Chains cannot be without Staley is short sighted.  Black Gives Way to Blue is exactly as it should be, as Alice in Chains should be here and now.  RIP Staley... I'm sure you are rocking out to this album, wherever you may be.
B001GCUO4I|5.0|After seeing the trailer or watching the previous movies you know what you are going to see. You aren't going to see The Final Destination for engaging dialogue, characters or a fresh spin on the plot. You are going to see it to watch death stalk and kill people in creative accidents. The 3D bonus ups the ante and makes The Final Destination an amazingly thrilling ride. The 3D itself works excelently and the deaths are more brutal than ever. Okay, so the movie has some problems. It is a little short and some of the acting is sub-par but for what it is, The Final Destination succeeds in being a blood soaked, action packed lesson about mortality.
B002KDUDG6|3.0|I must admit, I am not a big fan and have not been a fan of Michael Buble prior to listening to \\"Crazy Love\\", so I do not have any background to form an opinion upon.  I feel that the CD has some wonderful highlights, such as \\"Cry Me A River\\", \\"You're Nobody till Somebody Love you\\", and of course \\"Crazy Love\\".  Some of the remakes made me wonder: \\"heartache Tonight\\", really??!!  Overall, I like the tone of the CD, and his voice is amazing, so actually he could sing the phone book and make it sound wonderful.
B001PA0FFO|5.0|This a very intense movie leaving the viewer with alot of self examination. Excellent performances by all the actors.
0634023020|5.0|This book and CD, as far as I can tell, are a rare find for any intermediate guitarist looking to learn some nice chord melody arrangements.  There are a few chord melody books out there, but many of the arrangements are simplistic, or when they are not, do not include an accompanying CD which makes things more difficult if you're not an expert sight-reader (like me).  The arrangements in this book are not easy but are quite rewarding once you master them.  For those guitarists looking to take an already good arrangement in their own unique direction, you won't be disappointed here.  Most arrangements in this book include simple solo sections that lay down a nice foundation, but also invite you to take them in any direction you want.  Again, if you're not an expert sight-reader, I'd recommend listening to the accompanying performance on the CD several (or even many) times before digging into any particular arrangement.  The accompanying CD with Jamie Findlay's performances makes this product something special.  I would love to hear some nice performances of the chord melody arrangements in the Thelonious Monk, Kenny Burrell, and Jim Hall chord melody books.  So far, this is the best chord melody book I have found yet, and would love to see more just like it.
B002KDUDG6|3.0|I think that Michael has to take a chance, and move away from the old standards. Although I can't get over the fact that \\"Haven't Met You Yet\\" sounds rhythmicly and chordally remarkably like Sara Bareilles' \\"Love Song\\" (I originally thought SHE may have written it)... he should take that song and \\"Whatever It Takes\\" (which strangely has a muffled sound to it) and record another 10 songs which give him some uniquely new material.    By the way, check out the video which goes with \\"Haven't Met You Yet\\", it kind of grows on you with a \\"boy meets girl\\" dream sequence in a supermarket, filmed in Vancouver with his current girlfriend. (readily available on YouTube). They walk on top of freezers, and glide down an aisle in a bed.
B00005V3Z4|2.0|DONNIE DARKO     (USA - 2001)    Aspect ratio: 2.39:1 (Panavision)  Theatrical soundtrack: Dolby Digital    A lonely high school student (Jake Gyllenhaal) is beset by visions which portend either a mental breakdown or the End of the World...    Richard Kelly's debut film aims for cult status at every level but fails to fly off the screen. Though a fine actor, Gyllenhaal is basically miscast, and Kelly's style is too laidback to make much of an impact. Cult favorite James Duval (a regular in Gregg Araki's outrageous movies) makes a cameo appearance as the object of Gyllenhaal's strange 'visions'. Fine use of the wide Panavision frame.    A re-edited director's cut was subsequently released on home video.
B000BFH2S2|5.0|This concert lives up to my expectation and more.Excellent orchestra and arrengements and Bublé seemed to be having as much fun as I did enjoying the presentation. Bublé was at his best, obviously he put a lot of work into it and the results were extraordinarily enjoyjable.
B0001Z52RU|4.0|THE BUTTERFLY EFFECT    (USA - 2003)    Aspect ratio: 1.85:1  Theatrical soundtracks: Dolby Digital / DTS / SDDS    A young man (Ashton Kutcher) is 'cursed' with an ability to travel back in time to a series of traumatic childhood incidents and change the course of history, but his thoughtless actions have far-reaching - and often painful - consequences...    Astonishing, complex film, distinguished by Kutcher's heartfelt performance as the haunted character whose attempts to rectify past transgressions meet with disaster at every turn. The emotional pay-off is quite profound (especially in the director's cut, much better than the theatrical edition), though viewers are advised that the material is often VERY heavy indeed - you have been warned! An unexpected masterpiece.    Followed by several in-name-only sequels, beginning with THE BUTTERFLY EFFECT 2 (2006).
B001V9LPWQ|5.0|I absolutely loved seeing this on DVD!  I watched it on VHS when I was a kid and to have the opportunity to watch it with my daughter is priceless.    The picture was incredible - great quality!  This movie is a classic and I am so glad I was able to get it for our Disney Collection!

B001GQACGO|5.0|I bought this album the day it came out. I was always a Beyonce fan and I am  interested in all her songs and albums.She has beautiful voice and amazing range. I like the first disc but not from the first listen. It had to grow on me. My favorites from the first disc are \\"Disappear\\" and \\"That's Why You're Beautiful\\". The second disc had me dancing all over the place and it was more exciting. My favorites are \\"Sweet Dreams\\", \\"Ego,\\" \\"Single Ladies\\" and \\"Diva\\".I think I like Sasha Fierce better. The Beyonce disc gets kind of boring.I know Beyonce is probably not a boring person but I think she could've spice the Beyonce disc up. She should've added more up-tempo songs to it. Yet I don't really see a day and night difference between Beyonce and Sasha. All her albums sound like Sasha  and Beyonce. I don't see how she took a creative risk. All and all I think it is a good album. It deserves a listen. It has nice balladry,fun melodies and quiet yet explosive energy.
1433503794|2.0|I purchased this Bible for a gift and I wanted to look it over before I presented.  When I got the book I took it out of its shrink wrap and I opened it up to skim through it.  I had read some of the initially reviews of the book and I had read about how some of the print was blurry on some of the pages.  When I opened it up it automatically opened to a spot where on one page the print was clear and on the other page the print was blurry.  It was as if this specific spot had been opened up to before.  When I inspected the book further I noticed several other large sections that had the same blurry printing.  I do like this translation, but I am not impressed with the publishers presentation of it.  I do feel that if you are going to spend the money on a good study Bible that it should be devoid of such printing errors.
B002BSHWUU|5.0|I've scanned through and searched the forums, and find no discussion or even mention of this, which, given the totally incredible depth and breadth of the discussions concerning the two box sets and each individual CD, amazes me ... I just noticed today that several of my stereo CDs (and I assume all) do not include the pretty-much standard by now (or so I thought) Red Book CD-text data ... I had been using iTunes - burned copies in my vehicles (& of course those include the title and track data because I burned them that way), but while doing a sound level comparison I took the real deals out and voila, no CD-text title & track data.  Checking various sites online I see a few others have duly noted the absence (also on the mono box disks).    While not the end of the world, it seems strange to me that (1) it was omitted, and (2) also that I have seen so little mention of it online (and as I said, no mention of it here in the Amazon forums).    If anyone knows why the engineers would neglect or choose to omit this simple but nice \\"gravy\\" feature I would love to know the reason.  Thanks.
0385340540|3.0|This Novel is a great example of how something can be fair as a traditional published delivery and much more appealing as an audio book.  This novel is littered with passages in Italian and unless you can speak the language in your head, much is lost.  I read the book first and was not impressed.  My friend had the audio version and I listened to it during a couple of long plane trips and thoroughly enjoyed the narrative.
0066620996|5.0|This book does a good job illustrating the differentiating points of the best to poorest run companies.  Providing concepts that are easily grasped and presented with full authority.

B002KDUDG6|5.0|I love Michael Buble's CD \\"Crazy Love.\\"  This is a very special CD, and I have everything he has recorded.  The man's rich, warm, sensual voice is addicting.  You want to hear everything he sings, and this CD offers a wonderful variety of songs from upbeat, light songs to heartfelt ballads, and from great standards to pop songs.  Michael makes each song his own with his special interpretation.  The arrangements are brilliant.  Because of the way the album was recorded with the band and Michael in the same room, you feel as though you're right there in the studio with them, as though Michael is singing directly to you.  I give the CD 5 stars and heartily recommend it.  Peggy
B00005Y1UX|4.0|I think the point of this movie is how evil it is sell oneself for sex.  Demi Moore's character is an evil harlot, her husband isn't very bright & Gage is evil too.  But this movie is great at illustrating what happens when people fall for Satan's false promises so it's a very good movie.  People like these characters that don't repent are going to hell!
0756656230|5.0|I pre-ordered this set for my 12 yr old son.  I received it yesterday and I must say I am quite pleased with the set.  I found myself thoroughly enjoying the colorful pages and skimming over all the mini figures and sets that have evolved over the decades.  Viewing the pages provided a bit of nostalgia for me as I was able to share my own memories with my son.  This set is great for the Lego Collector or enthusiast.  I really enjoyed the overview of the history of Lego along with the timelines and descriptions of manufacturing, etc.<br /><br />If you are looking for \\"building tips\\" or \\"an idea book\\" this is not the book for you, instead I would look into the purchase of:  \\"The Unofficial Lego Builder's Guide\\" by Allan Bedford, or the DK Lego Modelers series that have booklets containing ways to create characters using common lego pieces that you may already have in your collection.
B002C6K7N0|4.0|Endgame starts out promising enough with a  good intro tune, \\"Dialectic Chaos\\" and a killer 2nd track \\"This Day We Fight\\". True, this tune doesn't have a traditional chorus as most of the album doesn't, but neither did Megadeths first 4 albums and they rule. Unfortunately, we are treated with, in my opinion, the worst song on the disk after this with track 3 \\"44 Minutes\\". The problem with this track  is not just lame lyrics. I describe it as the marriage between the lyrics and the music. Mustaine hasn't always been a master wordsmith, but he has always been able to marry the lyrics to his music very well. He could sing just about any lyric and it would sound great because of how he fit it with his scorching heavy rhythm. Not so here. Things recover nicely with track 4 \\"1,320\\". This song has everything I listen to Megadeth for in it. Like track 3 I can't listen to  Track 5 \\"Bite The Hand\\". There are a couple of  times on this album where a song sounds like  a parody of Megadeth. Track 5 is one of those times. Poor lyrics. Hey Mustaine, don't use the word \\"suicide\\" more than once in a song if it aint the chorus. Again, poor marriage of lyrics with music. Track 6 \\"Bodies\\" and track 7 \\"Endgame\\" have grown on me since I bought the disc. I can listen to both of these tunes from start to finish and feel pretty satisfied. Although, again the lyrics on the title track and the way they are sung sometimes sound like another band doing a parody of Megadeth. Only difference is  another band could never shred like Megadeth can. This is a good time in the review to make the statement that musically, this album is Totally Righteous!!! Dave, if your listening, keep up the good work musically. Tracks 8 \\"Sealed With A Kiss\\" and 9 \\"Head Crusher\\" should be considered instant classics as far as I'm concerned. I have nothing bad to say about tracks 10 \\"How The Story Ends\\" or 11 \\"the Right To Go Insane\\" either. The album finishes strongly and makes a person reconsider if they haven't justlistened to one of the great Megadeth albums of all time. My expectations for this album were through the roof because I absolutely loved United Abominations. I can't understand any Megadeth fan not liking that album .... unless your more into Risk era Megadeth. I Had to take a parting shot. I'm over my initial disappointment with Endgame. Other than a couple of tracks that I just can't listen to and a lyric here and there that I wish Dave had changed or sang differently, I dig this album.
B002RHI4T8|2.0|For a group of military and scientific people trained to go on a mission, they sure do break down awfully quick into a bunch of whiners!<br />This is NOT the Stargate Universe! Stargate has always been \\"Hey, we're in deep crap here, but lets pull it together, figure it out, and get home\\"<br />Instead we get a group of people boohooing their situation, whining about their situation, and blaming anyone in site for their situation. This isn't Battlestar Stargate. It's Lost In Space Stargate.<br />The best thing they did??? Kill off the politician!!!
B001DF68MA|5.0|We've purchased two.  Our three year old still loves to ride in his and our 15 month old begs to go on a bike ride.  This is a quality product that is a must have for any parent that can ride a bike.  It is plastic but it's not cheaply made and you can tell it was made with pride.  We have them on our cruiser bikes.  People stop us and ask us where we got them.
0385504225|5.0|Out of the 3 books with the main character I enjoyed this one the best.  This is simply a page turner not to be missed. The action is fast based and the interest is there from page 1 to the last page. His stories bring us into a world that can exist using facts that we may not be able to prove. Looking forward to the next story.
B002RHI4T8|2.0|The new Stargate doesn't thrill me; it looks like a cross between Atlantis and Battlestar Galactica, played on the set of Bioshock. The first two episodes are predictable, sort of. It makes me want to play Portal. I hope someone pulls the plug on this and writes a good scifi show but keeps the music and lighting.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|It is simply superb. Worth every penny buying this. I own DVD set as well but looking into Hi-Def is a eye joying experience...

B00275EHCI|3.0|I left the theater today with the same kind of \\"meh, it was ok\\" feeling I had after seeing \\"I, Robot\\" and \\"I am Legend\\".<br /><br />The mysteries that were in the movie were solved about 10 seconds after the question popped into my head, so the whole thing regularly seemed pretty elementary compared to what it could have been.<br /><br />A+: for an awesome idea (sci-fi soup-up of the \\"sociology of Chat Room/MMORPG addictions\\" issue... i.e. An \\"Exploratory Analyses Of The Social Nature Of Internet Addiction\\")<br /><br />A+: for special effects (besides the normal SFX, the Surrogates \\"look\\" is amazingly well done)<br /><br />B: for script and acting (the script really held the actors back in more than a few instances and the movie would have been nearly unwatchable with lesser actors.)<br /><br />F: for character development (many key characters made extremely limited appearances, but hey, it was only 90 minutes long)<br /><br />D: for overall execution (it could have been so much better)<br /><br />Over all a 3-star (on 5-star scale) film.  Wait to rent it.  But if you LOVE sci-fi then be sure to rent it when it comes out.  There isn't enough good, non-horror sci-fi to miss this and it is better than a B-rate.
B00009RDGA|5.0|This early 1970's wonderful movie was partially filmed in St. Joseph, Missouri where I lived at the time.  My house was about 3 blocks from the Holiday Inn where the entire cast stayed.  Town people would go to the motel to eat and walk around the lobby just to see the cast.  Tatum would be running around and frequently Ryan O'Neal, Sybil Sheppard,and Peter Bogdonavich would be eating in the dining room.  It was a fun experience while living in a midwest town.<br /><br />A wonderful, classic movie that will live on as one of the greatest!!!!
B001AVCFK6|3.0|I have struggled with this film for a while and while I love to have Star Trek in any form; my ultimate and final evaluation of this film is: we did not get what we were promised.    For years leading to the release of Star Trek XI (Now conveniently rebadged Star Trek AR) we were told by Abrams and crew the focus here was to make a great film - more so than great Star Trek.  The intent was to make a \\"realistic\\" space epic and a great film.  In trying to do both it may have succeeded in wetting long time Trekker appetites for their film fix but a closer inspection shows a failure on both fronts.    The story was a contrivance of convenience and happenstance, where an untested and inexperienced command crew finds fleet's brand new flagship falling into their hands.  To me these occurrences are not very realistic - are they?  The film asks the viewer to suspend belief on two many different levels in order to make Star Trek happen.  While to my surprise the cast turned out to be best talent one could have hope for in a Star Trek reboot (even Peg and Urban pulled off their performances despite my early skepticisms), it is rather unbelievable how the story unfolds.  Preferred might have been a streamlined, allegorical, version introducing new (or previously unexplored) characters with the center formed around the big three - Kirk, Spock, and McCoy.  And, yes, perhaps they could have left the Enterprise out until the very end.      If they were truly making this movie for those who know Star Trek and those who are newcomers to the experience alike, why did the story have to be crammed with unsubstantiated character development?  Were they truly trying to make a great film or were they making a great cash cow? The motives are suspect; it comes to mind that Paramount never did have the great financial success with Star Trek that Star Wars brought to FOX; and here, I think we have an instance were maybe they have reached too far with the beloved icons from one legendary genretrying to bridge into another.  For me, this just did not work; maybe the next one will seem less contrived.    3 out of 5 Stars.
0811806405|5.0|i bought this book as a textbook reference for my guitar making class, at palomar community college, which we all use. however, this is one of the better of all the books i have looked through when looking for instructional books. all procedures and technical data for every step, start to finish, are thoroughly detailed. troubleshooting and tweaking sound setup are also provided. i dont like that everything is in black and white, but in all this is an excellent book. includes instruction for both: classical and steel string designs, according to preferred methods of the authors.
B002GZQYMK|3.0|I've been a huge fan of Muse since their 2003 breakout album \\"Absolution\\", which was in my top 5 of the 2003 \\"best-of\\" albums of the year. Their subsequent album, 2006's \\"Black Holes and Revelations\\" was quite good as well. Now, after yet another 3 year lay-off, comes the band's eagerly anticipated fifth studio album.<br /><br />\\"The Resistance\\" (11 tracks, 54 min.) is really 2 albums in one. The initial 8 tracks of the album are a continuation of the Muse of old, albeit that this is a concept album of sorts, with frontman Matthew Bellamy bringing a story about leading a resistance against \\"them\\". The overall storyline sounds a bit paranoic to me. As to the songs themselves, they are quite uneven. \\"Uprising\\" rehashes previous sounds from Muse, without finding new ground. \\"United States of Eurasia\\" is a blatant rip-off of Queen, period. The chorus line from \\"Unnatural Selection\\" is blatantly lifted straight from ABBA's \\"Lay All Your Love On Me\\", believe it or not. The last three tracks of the album (13 min.) are a mini-symphony called \\"Exogenesis\\", and it is so far over the top that you can't hardly believe it.<br /><br />In my book, Muse has regressed with this album. Is it bad? No. But it's very uneven, and far below the previous two albums. I've seen Muse in concert a number of times over the years, and they always put on a blazing performance. Just saw them earlier this week (opening for U2), and the older songs ROCKED, the new ones not so much. THis album may them bring the US mainstream success the band has worked at very hard to get, but for me, I'll stick with their earlier albums.
B0006B29WA|5.0|This CD is full of catchy, totally get-up-and-move-your-body-even-if-it's-so-bad-it-doesn't-even-qualify-as-dancing songs! (Ok, that mostly applied to me...) These four guys sure bring a sweet addition to the scene! You won't regret buying this CD! I know I didn't!
B001PA0FFO|4.0|I enjoyed this film yet found Streep and Hoffman's performances to be a little hindered. I can't explain why but I just couldn't empathize with their characters. They were not bad performances, but they didn't knock my sox off like Streep and Hoffmen usually do.    A very very good film regardless.
B002POMLHY|5.0|This is some what like phobia. Same guitar tuning as Phobia. Anthem of the Angles, Crawl, Hopless, Give me a Sign, Without you, and Into the Nothing is my favorite songs off the album. Some songs like Dear Agony and What Lies Beneath i can careless cause its not like Breaking Benjamin to do, But i was suprise that the last song was not a slow song like Rain, Saturate, and Outro. Good record i got to say. The band did a amazing job and hope to see them live soon

B001FB4W0C|5.0|By the time you get to Season 4, you will be way past hooked on Supernatural. Watching Sam and Dean travel the countryside, \\"hunting\\" all sorts of evil is a kick. This season picks up where the last one left off, Dean stuck in Hell, and Sam taking his revenge by sending the black smoke back from whence it came. This one takes on color-eyed demons, movie monster madness, and ends with the big dark cheese himself rising up.<br /><br />My worry about all shows like this (dare I mention The Dead Zone) is that the writers will lose their way and in turn the show will lose its freshness. Fortunately, that has not happened to Supernatural. The stories are as strong as ever. And as always, there is a blend of small monster stories mixed into a broader \\"evil taking over the world\\" quest. The brothers play off one another very well, each with his own strengths and weaknesses. And even though they are constantly at odds with one another (e.g. Sam doing the bump bump with Ruby), they both value family above all else.<br /><br />Supernatural is without a doubt the coolest show on TV. Classic rock, hot chicks, awesome villains... what else could anyone ask for?
1416562605|3.0|I had read very positive reviews before reading this book, but have to disagree with the herd-type of rave reviews that now proliferate. Yes, this is a new view of India for readers who have little prior knowledge, the sardonic tone is somewhat disconcerting at first, and the mounting tension acts as a page-turner.    Nevertheless, the fact that so many reviewers claim to have \\"laughed out loud\\" must have been in response to reading a different book. I kept waiting for the other shoe to drop.    I think my discomfort is more in reaction to the loud and often unthinking acclaim given to this novel which, in reality, is much more modest in its achievements than its status as a Booker prize-winner would lead one to expect.    The protagonist is delusional, paranoid, and finally psychotic, committing a cold-blooded murder that was not strictly necessary in order to accomplish his life goal of getting rich quickly. (he could have just stolen the car.) Thus, I am mystified that so many readers should have focused on the so-called humor and overlooked the depraved morality of this survival story of doing whatever it takes to get ahead in modern India. really not so funny.    A good book, an interesting read, but certainly not a classic.
B001GCUO1Q|4.0|i really enjoyed this picture . thank god for NETFLIX . i seldom pay to see a film theatrically anymore (perhaps twice a year) . a co-worker told me she really enjoyed it and recommended it . i don't watch television (as i refuse to pay for it and hate the adds and so on) . perhaps seeing less makes you appreciate stories you do see more ? dunno , but i thought it was a lot of fun and worth owning for a modest price . liked the cinematography a lot too . judge for yourself .

You may be tempted to flip to the picture section first - we are so fortunate Craig shares his family pictures with us. I love Craig's unique sense of humor, and the book shows off his wonderful ability to make us laugh. The book takes you through his youth, his loves, and you're convinced by the end that the world is so much better off, in getting to know Craig Ferguson.
B002KDUDG6|4.0|There is only one thing better then listening to a Michael Buble C.D. - Listening to a new Michael Buble C.D. on a cold, gloomy, rainy Chicago day! Michael Buble always is able to take a song and make it his own. No matter the subject matter there is always an upbeat tone running through his music. His two new songs are great. This is the perfect album to sit back and make you sing along and be happy. I only wish he would write more of his own music! I can't wait to see him on tour! In the mean time I will sit back and listen to him brighten my rainy days!
0316044695|5.0|LONE SURVIVOR has become one of my favorite books to recommend.  This is coming from a person who routinely likes to read for pleasure.  However,  Marcus Luttrell's story is worthy of EVERYONE reading because it personifies what true patriotism, courage and honor should mean.  No, we all are not called upon to sacrifice what he has sacrificed, but I thank God that there are people like Marcus out there willing to give the \\"last full measure\\" for the rest of us and what the United States of America stands for....freedom!  The words \\"thank you\\" are too small to express my feelings to Marcus and the brave men and women of our military.

1552091090|1.0|Like many of the other 1-star reviews, I too found this book to be disturbing and mawkish.  I have experienced the death of a loved one -- in fact I did so at a rather young age -- and I assure you that this book will not help a child deal with the passing of a loved one.  It is insipid and creepy; it is the sort of thing that would inspire a Wes Craven film.  Aside from the story-line, though, the art is amateurish and the characters have that stilted, too-real-to-be-real quality that often makes cheap dolls look so sinister.  In short, it is a $20,000 therapy bill waiting to happen.  If you love your children, and will love them forever, then don't inflict \\"Love You Forever\\" on them...

0691143692|4.0|This is an absolutely excellent series of essays on the premier medieval empire, Byzantium.  The writer expertly sketches the history, indicating what is important and what it meant, both in belief and of historical impact.  What makes this book demanding and a great pleasure is that she respects the readers' intelligence and never over-simplifies for the sake of brevity; that being said, I would not recommend this to readers who are unfamiliar with the outlines of the history, to which she alludes but doesn't always explain.<br /><br />While not a historical narrative, the chapter progress more or less chronologically, from its origins in late antiquity, to its fall as a way to presage the Renaissance.  Founded at the great trade routes from East to West by the first christian emperor, Byzantium evolved into the first purely autocratic power with the legitimation rituals of traditional Asian kings.  It thus served as the model for the monarchies and petty despotisms that were rising to its West.  Herrin describes this better than anywhere I have seen this, in wonderful perspective.  Byzantium was also the first true christian state, mixing dogmatic monotheistic religion with the functions of government.  The way that it evolved and split into sects is clearly delineated by Herrin, the seeds of cultures we can see today.<br /><br />Herrin also argues that Byzantium was not a mere preserver of classical tradition, but a synthesizer of old systems with the new, that is, Christianity.  While I think she over-states her case - there is a genuine decadence to Eastern Rome's obsession with old forms - she makes one of the best cases I know for Byzantium's dynamism and creativity.  Personally, I find its art, its attempts at consolidating and preserving (and updating) Roman law rather stilted and derivative, but she convinced me that my view is far too one-sided.  In addition, she transmits the sense that Greek culture stayed very much alive in a more continuous and lively way than the Latin tradition did to the West.<br /><br />Finally, Herrin describes the legacy of Byzantium, both as the last-line defense against the Arabs and then the Turks, but also the impact of the exodus of Greek scholars to the West, providing many of the sources that flowered in the Renaissance.  I learned the most about the military history in this section, that the Byzantines had become accustomed to fighting the Persians in large military formations, leaving them vulnerable to Arab cavalry with its mobility and lighter-armed warriors fighting in the spirit of jihad.  Once the Turks appeared, the Byzantines had become famously decadent, squandering their energy in civil wars, doctrinal disputes, and preoccupation with Slavic pagans that they converted to Greek Orthodoxy.  The fall of Constantinople, in so many ways, signals the end of the Middle Ages, expertly evoked by Herrin in splendid prose.<br /><br />Warmly recommended for any serious student of history.n the Latin tradition did to the West.

0061767581|2.0|I watched \\"The Hills\\" for the first few seasons and was interested in reading LC's book when it came out. I figured it would be a fun, more behind the scenes look at the \\"reality\\" of reality tv shows.     The book starts out pretty blah. Honestly I almost put the book down after reading 10 pages that was how bored I was and how bad the writing is. She seems fixated on discussing \\"the typical Southern California woman\\" with blond hair, tan and big [...]. After mentioning this at least 5 times, you start to wonder if this is the type of woman she secretly wishes she was.     There is talk on the gossip blogs that the book was ghost written, and honestly I wish it was! It would be a lot more interesting. I actually believe Lauren wrote this. The ending of the book is supposed to be a cliffhanger for the next book in the series, but as another reviewer wrote, it just feels like the book ended abruptly with an incomplete ending.    Not Lauren's best first effort, but hopefully the next book will be better.
0385504225|5.0|I ordered my book prior to its release date, and was surprised and delighted to find it delivered to my house on the day it was released!!! LOVE Amazon...and LOVE Dan Brown! I can't wait to order his next book...although I'm sure it won't be for quite a while. I feel he is the greatest author of our time!
0399230033|3.0|Two of the pages were stuck together with a drop of something. That was diasappointing from a quality standpoint. Since it was a small item purchased along with another larger item, it wasn't worth returning. If it had been in a store, I would not have purchased it.
B001HBX8NC|5.0|I've only recently been buying opera on blu-ray, and this is by far the best I've seen. Very often, when one sees contemporary opera on DVD, a viewer finds himself sitting through a \\"Euro-trash\\" version of the opera, where the director runs riot, ignoring the original intentions of the composer and librettist, and doing nothing except drawing attention to himself. But here is a Rigoletto that I imagine Verdi would have loved. Combined with exemplary audio and sound, it would be hard to give a higher recommendation to this disc.
B002HJ9PTO|5.0|Purchased this mic in order to do interviews and video presentations and it has been excellent. Have a professional Shure wireless set up as well, but have found this to be an great alternative when I need to move quickly. It allows me to use my Sony HD handycam with a minimum of additional equipment and allows for a fast set up. Have used the mic for approximately 10 hours and the battery has not yet run out. Be sure to purchase additional button batteries when you purchase this, though. They always run out right when you don't have them on hand. L-45 batteries are really inexpensive. I purchased 50 for under $10 here on Amazon. Would definitely recommend this mic as a primary or backup mic for any prosumer set up where the subject isn't going to be moving around (interviews, training, etc.)
B000ZLFALI|5.0|Just scanning a few of the reviews...they all said it very well. Bottom line, I am ready to buy the movie and also for good measure the soundtrack so I have options.  It was creative, fun, and just when it got to be a bit much..they broke into a fab song..what more could you ask??
0307408833|2.0|As has already been pointed out, this is a beautiful book, and it gets readers excited to cook despite the hefty price tag on every ingredient required. If the recipes themselves lived up to the writing and the design of the book, it would be completely worth all the celebrity praise that has been heaped upon it (although, looking at it now, I realize the praise is for treats made AT Babycakes, by Babycakes, not really for the cookbook). I've heard so many rave reviews of the bakery that I was chomping at the bit to get my hands on this book. I immediately went out and spent $80 on ingredients (I had none of them on hand, which I would imagine is true for most bakers) and tackled the recipe I was most excited about: gingerbread with vanilla frosting. It was a disaster, but it didn't stop me from trying another recipe. And another.    Here are my three biggest issues with the cookbook:    The first and most major disappointment for me in working my way through this cookbook is that it seems pretty clear it was never properly tested by regular people in regular kitchens. Perhaps in the commercial ovens of the Babycakes bakery, in commercial pans, the cooking times and temperatures listed in the book are right on. But the sad fact is that in a regular kitchen with a regular oven, they are completely off (most of that $80 ended up in giant globs on the bottom of my oven, smoking up the joint). That first recipe I made was not just \\"moist\\" in the center, it was completely raw and inedible. As for other reviewers, the frosting was a huge (and again, expensive) disappointment for me: not only was it nothing like real frosting, it had that distinct, gluten-free texture I've come to refer to as \\"Metamucil-mouth.\\"    Which leads me to the next big issue I have with the cookbook...and really with all \\"alternative\\" cookbooks of late. Please JUST STOP saying \\"no one will be able to tell the difference\\" and referring to your recipes as \\"great substitutes\\" for the traditional versions. A) It isn't true that they taste identical to. At best, they are reminiscent of. And B) if it really is a great dish, or treat, then just say it's great. Don't compare it to its non-alternative counterpoint, because you're going to turn off the very people who would benefit most from changing their diet to include more wholesome, nutritious foods.    Third issue: Coconut oil. I made the frosting three times, each time in a food processor. The third time, I thought \\"Hey, why don't I melt the coconut oil so it's smoother to begin with?\\" Nowhere in the cookbook does it say to do this. But when I did, the results were shockingly improved. The flavor still had Metamucil mouth, but the consistency was actually something akin to \\"fluffy.\\"    Interestingly enough, I bought the Babycakes cookbook right on the heels of another cookbook purchase: Falling Cloudberries: a World of Family Recipes by Tessa Kiros. It is in no way vegan, gluten-free, or sugar free...but neither am I, actually. I've just found that I feel and look much better when I don't have too much wheat, meat, or sugar in my diet. Like the Babycakes cookbook, Falling Cloudberries features stunning photography (though it's a completely different aesthetic), fantastic writing, and a spirit of enthusiasm that makes you want to get in the kitchen and tear it up. And I wondered, maybe the lack of really foodie-worthy gluten free cookbooks stems from the lack of real chefs--people who already know so much about food--writing them. Every bit of hype for Falling Cloudberries was more than warranted by the recipes. Babycakes, not so much.     Maybe it just wasn't the right time for a Babycakes cookbook. By all accounts, the shop is constantly hopping with happy, satisfied customers returning for more. Maybe Erin McKenna and company didn't want to give out their actual recipes for fear of being copied in other establishments. Who knows. In the end, I wound up finding some great recipes on my own that feature the ingredients I bought and customizing them to my taste..and I make them all the time. One such recipe, for savory chickpea pancakes, has resulted in weekly dinner parties because I've had so many people ask for more. It's simply a delicious recipe--not a \\"substitute\\" for something else. So take heart and stay curious; there really are good things out there to use that fava/garbanzo flour for. :)[[ASIN:0740781529 Falling Cloudberries: A World of Family Recipes]]

B002E01LL6|3.0|So now we know that Tatum Channing is not only a terrific dancer, he's a fighter, as well. If he were more of an actor, he'd be a hell of a triple threat. Looks like the movie industry has tapped Channing to be the next cinematic heartthrob. And he's got the drop dead good looks, the athletic build, and the swagger to pull it off. FIGHTING takes him back to what he seems to do best, which is playing these sulky but good-hearted street hip kids. Here, his character actually hails from Birmingham, Alabama, but as the movie opens he's scammed in NYC long enough to have become wise to the hard knock life.<br /><br />When longtime street hustler Harvey Boarden (Terrence Howard) stumbles onto Shawn MacArthur (Channing), Shawn's been barely making do by foisting shady merchandise on unwary pedestrians. Seeing Shawn handle himself in a fight, Harvey takes him under his wing and introduces him to the underground fight circuit, becoming his manager. And that's pretty much the gist of it. The formulaic plot eases down its predictable track, and when, in the climax, the question looms over whether Shawn will throw the big fight, well, what do you think? If you've seen [[ASIN:B00004W223 Gladiator]] (with James Marshall and Cuba Gooding, Jr.) and Van Damme's [[ASIN:0783228465 Lionheart]], then you're familiar with the blueprint.<br /><br />Films like this, more than ever it hinges on the acting performances, and also because this is more a character study than an action piece. Terrence Howard is a good actor, although sometimes he's so low key that it borders on listless. He doesn't do anything for me here. Good thing then that this flick's more about Tatum Channing. Channing reverts to his patented brooding, not-speaking-a-lot-of-lines thing that he does, but at least he does that pretty well. I'm not sure if he has charisma, but he's got this vibe about him. Also very easy on the eyes is the smoking hot and very good Zulay Henao. She makes the most of her time onscreen, gracefully avoiding all those possible pitfalls assumed with her struggling single mom/nightclub waitress character (whose name is also Zulay). How can you not fall for her? Zulay and Tatum look very good together, and there's a spark and a sweetness in their romance. But one of the few things up in the air about this story is just what is going on with Zulay and Shawn's manager, Harvey? It's certainly a no-brainer that Shawn will go kabonkers when he finds out about this. Although, this is one of those contrived plot devices which could've been easily resolved early on by Zulay simply filling Shawn in about her history with Harvey.<br /><br />Having checked out the trailer, I thought there'd be more fighting. But Shawn only fights four times in the circuit, and they weren't all that. One of them, though, is with showy mixed martial artist Cung Le, and I'm still trying to figure out how Cung Le lost that one. Skills wise, well, Tatum Channing doesn't have any, really. His character has a school wrestling background, and that's pretty much his style, which is very raw. He bobs and weaves and throws punches, but when push comes to shove, the boy will resort to his ground game. I like that he stays a raw brawler, that he doesn't all of a sudden become this smooth, highly skilled operator. In most of those fights, Shawn is a hair's breath away from getting his head handed to him. That he wins is more because of his big heart and, sometimes, because of sheer luck. I like that the fights are short and brutal (and I wish they were more brutal). Otherwise, feh.<br /><br />The longstanding concensus is that New York City is the most kinetic place to shoot city scenes. FIGHTING captures the urban vibe, the bustling, gritty, jive-ridden energy of NYC, and it looks as if every cat on the avenue is either working on a hustle or else is getting worked on.<br /><br />The DVD doesn't really come with a lot of bonus features. There are five deleted scenes (totaling 8 minutes), including analternative second meeting between Shawn and Zulay. This gives me one more chance to ogle the sexy Zulay Henao who, with mad respect to Tatum Channing, is the highlight of the movie for me. Zulay Henao's brand of sexy and really good performance hike my rating up to 2.5 out of 5 stars. FIGHTING is a nice rental. I'm not sure that I'd buy the DVD.alternative second meeting between Shawn and Zulay.

0385504225|5.0|Reading this excellent book made me wonder about the true meaning and practice of humanism, and how it has imprisoned the body in the soul. Certainly the Classic and Christian ethical periods provided us with no guidance, but what direction did the Enlightenment turn us towards? How can we formulate a contemporary ethical system from the concerns of the humanist doctrine?<br />Is there a possiblity for ethics in the modern world?<br /><br />I tried to contrast the authors viewpoints to some of these concerns, and it was interesting and challenging. I look forward to his next book.
B002BFBAWO|2.0|This could be the lamest \\"coming of age\\" film I've ever seen.  Neither the characters nor their relationships are credible in the slightest.  Jesse Eisenberg lacks the charisma to star in a movie like this.  I would suggest that the writer/director find a more suitable occupation -- perhaps operating a train.  Then all he'd have to worry about is keeping the train on the track and not overshooting the platform at a station.  I give this one more than the minimum one star because the actress who plays Lisa P. is indeed a lovely sight to behold dancing.  If you don't already have \\"The Graduate\\" on DVD, that's the coming of age film to own instead of this turkey.
B002K0WBXW|5.0|Sandra Bullock vuelve , en esta película, al sitial de las muy buenas actrices que , por si solas, hacen recomendable ver una película.

Pero como casi todo tiene solución en la vida, el tema consiste en encontrar la mejor solución a ese problemita. Muy bien Ryan Reynolds, consolidándose como uno de los mejores actores de comedia (había estado excelente en Definitely maybe, con Isla Fisher), bien secundado por Craig T.Nelson,Betty White, etc. Hay una escena , cuando pierde el celular S.Bullock, que es realmente original y de lo mas divertido de la película.

0385737947|4.0|I've been hearing a lot about The Maze Runner everywhere I turn, so when it came up for review at Amazon Vine, I jumped at the chance to read it.  And once I started, I couldn't put it down.    The Maze Runner was an incredibly gripping read.  I read each page with anticipation, trying to figure out what was going on.  Dashner does a wonderful job creating a vivid world that the reader can picture in their mind.  This is a place full of questions, with few answers to be had.  Every time Thomas turns around, he is faced with another puzzle, something else that just doesn't add up.  It makes this book very difficult to put aside once you've started it.    Thomas is an endearing character that is easy to like.  He is incredibly curious about the Glade and what is going on around him.  Though sometimes his inquisitiveness can be borderline obnoxious, it's clear that he's a natural leader and needs to know what is going on around him.  I liked that he was brave and willing to take risks for people he barely knew.  The mystery surrounding him was also compelling and it really propelled the story forward and kept the reader hooked.    I have to say, I didn't love the ending of the novel.  I felt like the solution to everything was too easy, too simple.  Though the end of The Maze Runner opens up an entire new can of worms (after all, this is the first book in a trilogy), I'm not sure I like where it's going.  To me, it was just strange.  That isn't to say I'm not eager to read the next book - I'm just not entirely certain about it!    The Maze Runner is inevitably going to be compared to The Hunger Games, another YA science fiction trilogy.  Though I do have to admit I enjoyed The Hunger Games more, The Maze Runner is still an amazingly suspenseful novel that I definitely recommend.

B0021L8UXU|5.0|Ok, now that my oh so original tagline has your attention, let me start off this review by saying: This is NOT your conventional zombie film.  I repeat, this is NOT your 28 Days Later, Dawn of the Dead, or even Shaun of the Dead (although the latter did inspire, I'm sure!).  So what makes Zombieland different?  Well, strictly speaking, it's not survival horror.  If you're going in here expecting to see a group of people being chased by zombies and cornered into a foxhole for a final blowout, you'll get some glimmer of that, but will probably be sorely disappointed.  (And if you're here to see peoples' limbs and insides getting pulled out by hoards of the raging undead, you'll probably be even more disappointed!)  As one reviewer mentioned, the zombies are there, in all their oozing, screeching, sprinting glory, but they're more of a backdrop; a set piece.  Why?  Because the characters we encounter in this film are different.  They've already made it through the zombie apocalypse.  Their world has changed, but they're still living in it.  This movie is about them surviving each other.<br /><br />If you really need a genre to pigeon hole this movie into, I'd say it follows more of the conventions of your road trip comedy.  Think Little Miss Sunshine even.  Only with zombies.  And Little Miss Sunshine's got a gun.  The movie starts with our humble narrator, Jesse Eisenberg, who managed to evade death by simply being himself- an overcautious loner with a strict set of survival rules which he is more than happy to share and execute within the first five minutes of the film.  He's lived through the worst of the worst, but he is on his way from Texas to Ohio to see what is left of his somewhat estranged family.  Along the way he runs into Tallahassee (\\"No names\\") played by Woody Harrelson, a caution to the wind, zombie killing machine who acts on impulse and has seemingly kept his sense of humor along with a noticeable streak of insanity.  My only wish is that the movie spent a longer period of time with just these two, as the chemistry between the actors was a spot-on match made in heaven.<br /><br />The last two of the main cast are quickly introduced however, in the form of two hard as nails sisters, played by Emma Stone and Abigail Breslin, who's prerogative for surviving is to only trust each other.  From here, the movie substitutes story and survival horror for fairly standard road trip hijinks and tightly written bantering as the four cope with working together at reaching their ultimate goal- a rumored zombie free amusement park.  (Of course we all know what a dumb idea this is from the start, but in zombie ridden wasteland where you may have found the last surviving people in the country, what else are you going to do?)  Perhaps the last thing worth mentioning in this review is the extended celebrity cameo, but you have to see it for yourself...<br /><br />Wrapping up, Zombieland is to road trip comedies as Shaun of the Dead was to romantic comedies, maybe even moreso by making the zombies simply less of a threat- at least, up until the film's finale.  If you're a fan of the recent string of witty, hip comedies and road trip movies, you'll probably appreciate the ooey gooey laughs that Zombieland brings to the plate.  If you're a fan of gore and Left 4 Dead style zombie shootouts, there's enough here to keep you satisfied in between the character development.  -But what really struck me about Zombieland is how close I felt to each of the characters by the end of the film, even without learning much of their past or even their names.  Once again, great writing, great cast, and great direction makes Zombieland a trip you might think about taking more than once.

B00007KWI9|4.0|Yes - Yes (3.5 stars)<br />Original Release: July 25, 1969<br /><br />Songs:<br /><br />Beyond and Before (4 stars)<br />The lyrics see in a mystical way a winter forest as transparent to the eternal.  There is good rock here upheld by a muscular bass line.  The coda brings the energy down.<br /><br />I See You (3 stars)<br />This song moves quickly but settles into a softer, jazzy mode with multiple voices singing.  The lyrics describe an anima projection in dynamic imagery.  The song builds in volume but quietens when it reaches an instrumental improvisation.  The guitar musings contain interesting phrases.  The improvisation shifts into a harder rock mode until the rhythm section takes over before dropping back into the vocals again.  The rhythmic, staccato of the coda echoes the climax of the improvisation.<br /><br />Yesterday and Today (3 stars)<br />Hippie, mystical love song with quiet instrumentation.  The lyrics are classic Jon Anderson poetry that captures a meaning in a mystically self-referencing way:<br /><br />There's only us simply because thinking of us makes us both happy<br /><br />Looking Around (3 stars)<br />Upbeat song.  The lyrics seem to be about how we can transform our view of the world with a chance encounter that brings the key to finding that meaning.  What inspires then pays forward.<br /><br />Harold Land (4 stars)<br />Long instrumental introduction that forms a grand entry into the song.  Then the song quietens for the vocals.  The lyrics describe a young man who went to war as an officer and came back an emotional shell.  This is done effectively in three concise sections.  The vocals are passionate about their subject.  The instrumental sections which frame the song seem, with repeated listening, seem to dissociate from the vocal portions of the song.  Sort of like a picture frame that doesn't match the picture.<br /><br />Every Little Thing (4 stars)<br />Intense instrumental introduction with great drums here.  The band dances instrumental circles around this Beatles tune.  The energy (which can seem relentless at times) in this song reflects the energy of the whole album.

B00005JLKB|4.0|I was originally drawn to Smallville only because I knew Jensen Ackles was in season 4, but this is a sweet show with truly likable characters and actors.  I didn't expect to enjoy it as much as I do; I thought it would be geared far too much toward teenagers. I was wrong; anyone can enjoy Smallville.  It's a show that embraces it's comic book roots and expects you to as well.  There has to be a freak of the week, there has to be someone for Clark to fight, so expect a lot of weird happenings for small town Kansas!  Suspend disbelief and enjoy the fun!<br /><br />Tom Welling really grows as an actor throughout the first season, Michael Rosenbaum is fantastic, and the rest of the cast is great.  Give Smallville a chance and I guarantee you'll care about the characters and love the story.

0618918248|1.0|I couldn't even finish reading this book.  I truly believe that Richard Dawkins is the one who is delusional.  It griefs me that this load of garbage is in print and is influencing young, impressionable people.  It would be one thing if Mr. Dawkins just chose to believe this pack of lies himself,  but it is extremely upsetting that he will one day have to take responsibility for all the minds he has poisoned.
B002GU5V24|5.0|In actuality, I paid the price just to get the 2 live shows with Peter Gabriel.  Not the biggest post-Gabriel fan, except for maybe \\"Duke\\" and a few singles here and there.  Losing Gabriel re-formed the group causing Collins to change his role in the group.  What else could they have done?  Unfortunately, it changed everything.  However, I have to admit that paying the price to get the 2 concerts with Gabriel was way worth it.  Incredible!!!  As a bonus to the \\"Live\\" CD, they have added several songs from \\"The Lamb\\" show at the Shrine in LA (I was there!!!) in surround sound.  Again, incredible!  Imagine if they spend the time to do that to the entire concert!  I do listen to the \\"new Genesis\\" concerts, but they hardly move me like the \\"old Genesis\\" concerts.

0307588335|5.0|An inside look at one of the most pivotal events in recent financial history. If you really want to get a good understanding on the causes of the current global economic meltdown and how the housing run-up and mortgage derivatives fueled possibly the greatest market irrationality since the original Tulip Mania, then Larry McDonald's narrative from the inside of the Lehman Brothers collapse will open your eyes and be a true educational experience. This is one book to keep on the bookshelves and refer back too often. My wife is reading it now and is encouraging her mom to pick it up as well.
0385504225|3.0|I wasn't too surprised to find that Brown wrote yet another book in the same style as before. This book had the typical Langdon quest to track something down while solving a puzzle after a stream of brilliant deductions that he was able to come up with quickly and while under pressure. It had the usual good guys and bad guys and people who might have been one or the other but one couldn't really be sure. And in the end, something or somebody isn't what it had appeared to be.<br /><br />Despite that, Brown managed to make things work in the past by having good story lines and far fetched circumstances that one could have accepted as possible given the situation. This time, things were such a stretch that I still cannot imagine the most insane person ending up in the role of this novel's villain.<br /><br />A real person can be brilliant, yet sometimes miss things. When it's not a real person, an author must figure out what the main character could conceivably overlook that would be accepted by the readership. In Angels and Demons, I thought it was a stretch that Langdon did not find it obvious that a symbol he was looking at was a mirror image.  In this book, we are expected to believe that Langdon's unmatched talents for decoding symbols could leave him drawing a blank because he could not tell that something was upside down.<br /><br />In this novel, the CIA has a top person looking into things for some unknown reason. This person is supposed to be such a super spy that she knows everything that anybody anywhere is doing. It's never made clear in the book why it would be a legitimate CIA affair, unless you accept that they can run amok for their own benefit. But more importantly, we find out that much of the knowledge that this character has comes from a pre-existing wiretap of somebody's cell phone. Yet after a day of monitoring things, a text message gets sent from that phone that would have presented the opportunity for the CIA to end the entire problem almost instantly while averting another disaster.<br /><br />If there had been some explanation why they had missed it, perhaps I would have understood. But it never came up. Even if that character could have overlooked something so obvious, could her entire staff of top level CIA operatives have monitored phone calls and voice mail for the phone but missed a text message? I don't think so. This same person was aware of a different text message that nobody could have possibly known about. Go figure.<br /><br />If Langdon initially got fooled into something by never confirming the legitimacy of a phone message, is it credible that other highly intelligent leading characters would also act based on an unconfirmed phone call, or accept a text message at face value or fail to look at one from a phone that is being monitored? How many times can people make the same mistake?<br /><br />Several times in the story, Brown wanted to mislead readers into thinking something else. So he did it by saying that something else happened. Then later he says that that wasn't what really happened.<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT.<br /><br />We are supposed to believe that a son who is not willing to follow in his father's footsteps but is willing to take untold millions of dollars in inheritance is not smart enough to get out of a jam on his own. His father could have taken the dishonest path by bribing somebody, but the son is too stupid to figure out on his own that he could have bribed someone. Just when you think the son should be able to figure that out, You are told that something else happens. It would have required the son to be stupid and to have shot off his mouth to an impossible extent for what followed. It would have made no sense for a jail guard never to have asked for a bribe or for him to go along with a tenuous plan involving a third party that would have been simple had the son been involved instead.<br /><br />We are then expected to believe that a father's honesty which would haveleft his son in jail for another day or so for something the son did wrong would be considered such an outrage that the son would be willing to dedicate the rest of his life to revenge, killing off his whole family, trying to destroy the entire nation, even though doing so would involve learning everything he eschewed in the first place, but to a much further level, and would be accompanied by so much other learning, preparation, and untold endeavors. He would have to study arcane aspects of religion, culture, and philosophy to get away with it. He would also have to miss the entire message of everything he learned along the way and never have the thought that any pain his father might have caused was insignificant compared to the literal pain he brought upon himself afterward. By literal, I mean literal.<br /><br />The biggest reason for any outrage over the father's actions was supposedly that it lead to the death of his son. But his son could not have gotten outraged for that reason since he never died and was never in danger of dying. And had he died, he would not have been outraged since he would have been dead. Had the reader believed he had died, then the reader would have needed to believe that the person outraged by the death was the person who did the killing. Such a person would have been more likely to have been grateful for the opportunity, given the wealth he obtained by doing so.<br /><br />In the end Brown wants you to think the thing you ruled out in the beginning, accepting that a family was never asked to identify a body and that law enforcement was fine with that, and that Brown's explicit statements were supposed to have been interpreted as \\"it seemed as if...\\" are all a mistake on your part. I'm sure I'm not the only person who read through those paragraphs a second time before continuing with the book just to be sure things weren't happening in the obvious way. But in the end, we find out that at least that part really did happen in the obvious way.<br /><br />As to the big mystery of life that the quest was supposed to reveal, Brown would have been better off ending the book earlier with the message that the secrets were once again safe where they belonged. That would have been fine with Langdon who never cared about such secrets in the first place. Instead, Langdon persists until his once again super sharp cryptographic skills allow him to unlock a secret that was not really a secret to the people who were keeping it a secret, and nothing more than something that is already a common viewpoint among many.<br /><br />A final point is that if you kill of Langdon too early in the book, readers will know it didn't make any sense. Just because you said he was dead didn't mean he was dead. It meant you wanted us to think so, and later you want us to say \\"I guess I was wrong. I never saw it coming that he might be alive somehow.\\" Things like that took all the suspense out of it.

0061438294|5.0|I thought some of the negative reviews were a bit critical of this book. This book lays a solid foundation to reading non verbal actions or \\"tells\\". I've read several other books on this subject and thought this was a solid read and I was very happy with my purchase. There is no single book offered that will turn you into an expert over night.     It is important to realize that reading people is a skill. You don't become great at it over night or an expert right after reading the book. Just like any other skill, you have to practice and work at it. You develop the skill of paying attention and picking up on the little things. Once you are able to do that, you then have to determine what all of those things mean. I'm a single male, small business owner and avid poker player. Being able to read people can be very useful in dating, business and at the poker table.     One thing that is very interesting is that some actions or \\"tells\\" are very common and seem to always mean the same thing. Other actions or \\"tells\\" are unique to each person. What may mean one thing for one person, may actually mean the opposite when done by another person. The \\"magic\\" of being able to read people is being able to determine what those actions mean for individual people. Sometimes it's not an action at all but it is what people DON'T say or do that can paint you the entire picture.     In my business, I use my ability to read people to determine whether or not they are being truthful or are uncomfortable with something. If I see them acting in a certain way that makes me believe they are uncomfortable, I go out of my way to explain things to them so that they might be more comfortable with the situation or outcome. In my personal life, I can determine whether or not my friends or family are having a good or bad day and/or might want or need something. This book should be a dating book as well. I can't stand dating. Not many people are very up front and honest about how they feel about another person, especially on a first date. I am not kidding you when I say that there are more non-verbal \\"tells\\" on a first date than in any other situation! If you want to know if a woman likes you or not, pay attention to her actions throughout the date. I'm not an expert, but I think I can figure it out in 10 minutes or less! (Good or bad!....ok, mostly bad, lol)     I enjoy playing poker. I play in home games and I play $1/$2 No Limit Hold Em in the casino poker rooms. This book really is a big help with poker tells. It's helped me make some extraordinary calls and folds. Several times I've stunned the entire table and the dealers with my reads. Just a few things off of the top of my head are, people who've made very strong hands will often tilt their heads while betting or thinking of betting, hold their hands together-touching only at the finger tips, bounce one leg like crazy (happy feet), slide their chips into the pot very slowly or gently or give off a genuine smile. People who have hit the flop also tend to look away right away if they notice they've hit their card(s). Normally people who hit the flop do not stare at the flop. People who are on drawing hands tend to call bets very quickly, seeming to give it no thought what-so-ever. People who have a poor hand or are on a bluff often force a smile (there is a difference if you pay attention!), or purse their lips together, have an increased blink rate, forcefully bet chips into the pot or speak very loudly as they announce \\"RAISE\\" or \\"ALL IN\\". They are trying to scare you or force you out of the pot. After reading this book, my poker reads went through the roof. I think it is because I was paying attention and putting more effort into it. I noticed another player at my home game would sometimes slide his chips into the pot without saying a word when he was all in. He keeps his chips in a big messy pile throughout the game. But sometimes he would actually take the time to count his chips and stack them neatly into the pot when he moved all in. He takes his time counting his chips and then announces the value amount to the table. When he counts them, he is bluffing. He wants his stack to be known in hopes of scaring off the other opponents. I call him with very weak holdings when he does this and I fold when he slides his chips into the pot without counting them or saying a word. He has no idea he is doing this and I'm not about to say a word! This tell is 100%. I actually saw another player do this in the casino and I made an extraordinary call to win the pot.     This book is full of good information to use in many situations. It teaches you the basics (and then some), but it is up to you to figure out how to put theory into practice and actually stay focused.
B000P6J8TS|5.0|THE BIRDS metaphorically plays out the frailties of the human species as the fears of befuddled are visually juxtaposed against hoards of birds gone on a destructive rampage. Humans rebel against nature and each other as the birds represent nature in harmony turned against human progenitors who stand to disrupt harmony or so it may seem.<br /><br />Rod Taylor's solid performance, as the steadfast Mitch Brenner who gradually realizes (but cannot fathom why) that things are beyond even his control, is pivotal to the progression of the story. The importance of Taylor's performance has been long overlooked. This film is a masterpiece full of vivid histrionics running the gamut of human emotions. Jessica Tandy as Lydia Brenner is a somewhat domineering figure but gradually becomes the epitome of human frailty at its lowest ebb. Tippi Hedren as Melanie Daniels is a somewhat shallow soul searching perhaps for guidance in the person of Mitch Brenner. Suzanne Pleshette as school teacher Annie Hayworth gives a very direct performance as a very young world weary cynical soon-to-be spinster who knows exactly what she wants. However as she has vied for the attentions of Mitch Brenner, her efforts remain fruitless and she is about to face the perils of nature's unknown.<br /><br />In the end all the central characters have lost all their apparent external strengths and only retain their limited ability to survive be it from their own perseverance and/or from the offered affection from a loved one.<br /><br />Human Frailty
B001SN83KC|5.0|The Giver is a very well written book! I loved reading it. It is a good book for older kids and adults. I give the Giver two enthusiastic thumbs up!I have not read the sequel Gathering Blue but Iam shur it will be a good book!
B000002G89|5.0|No need to give an extensive recap of the story here...Pete Townshend arranged the Rainbow \\"comeback\\" concert ([[ASIN:B000001EEN Eric Clapton's Rainbow Concert]]) as post-heroin addiction therapy for Eric. The show...while it is to be applauded for the effort...is sloppy and tentative, as you might expect it to be under the circumstances. That said, \\"461 Ocean Boulevard\\" was the true \\"comeback\\" album for Clapton.    It's more laid back than fans of Cream, Derek & The Dominos, or even Clapton's first solo album ([[ASIN:B000FDEUG2 Eric Clapton]]) might expect. The late Carl Radle is on hand from the Dominos, as is Yvonne \\"Jesus Christ Superstar\\" Elliman on vocals. The remainder of the core band, which is bolstered by the presence of guest musicians, is Dick Sims on keyboards, George Terry on guitar & background vocals, and Jamie Oldaker on drums.    For \\"Phase I\\" of Clapton's comeback, this is the strongest overall effort by far. Fans are already familiar with the \\"Cream Killer\\" story...Clapton read a review in Rolling Stone about a Cream concert which slammed the band for its endless and aimless noodling, which caused him to seek inspiration elsewhere (notably in The Band's [[ASIN:B00004W50T Music from Big Pink]], by virtue of its success via song-based, rather than jam-based, music).    On the original release, the winning songs were \\"Please Be With Me\\" by Tommy Talton of Cowboy (which also appears in a wonderful, heartfelt, amazing version on Tish Hinojosa's album [[ASIN:B000000FCT Taos to Tennessee]]), \\"Let It Grow\\" (strong on harmony vocals and a dynamic fade-out). There is debate over Clapton's \\"I Shot The Sheriff,\\" but as a Bob Marley fan, let's give credit where credit is due. Bob showed up frequently on American FM radio airwaves after the release of Clapton's song. Just as Elvis, The Beatles and The Rolling Stones covered American music and put it in the hands of the American record-buying public, Clapton exposed Bob to a wider audience. No apologies are needed or offered.    You also get the requisite Robert Johnson track, \\"Steady Rollin' Man,\\" and \\"I Can't Hold Out\\" by Elmore James. From there, it's a matter of personal preference.    EC's next couple of albums would be universally slammed in the rock press for being too laid back and lifeless. It wasn't until [[ASIN:B000002G8F No Reason to Cry]] that he entered the second and more dynamic phase of his solo career, joined by Bob Dylan, Ronnie Wood, and members of The Band.    \\"461 Ocean Boulevard\\" is an essential chapter in the story of a musician who became a leader by following. Clapton has remained true to his roots, has shared the spotlight with his heroes and influences, and will always have my respect and admiration for doing so.
B001DF68MA|4.0|This is a great product. If my daughter were to review it from her point of view it would get 5 stars. She went from riding in the back of trailer with limited visibility to riding on top of the bike with me. I really love the fact that I can interact with her. When we ride she can point to dogs and say \\"Doggy\\" or when she sees water she says \\"agua.\\" It's a beautiful thing to see her enjoy the ride. Now I would rate this a three because the bar is very cumbersome to remove. I wish there would have been quick releases instead of 4 screws to remove every time you want to ride your bike without the bar. As a result I do not take the bar off and it is quite heavy, it does add some extra weight to your ride. There is one bolt that is screwed in from the chair to the bar to keep the seat in place. It can be difficult to line them up at times. Again here I wish a quick quick realease would have been put in place instead. Overall if you are looking to buy this for the experience you will have with your child it is a great product, I would buy it again. The extra troubles are worth the expression you get from your child.
B002KDUDG6|3.0|After listening to Michael Buble's new cd, I was initially disappointed.  I thought he could do no wrong.  His previous releases were full of spunk.  This cd was a bit drab for my liking.  My husband and mother both had the same reaction and stated that it could \\"put them to sleep.\\"      On the other hand, I am trying to keep an open mind to \\"Crazy Love.\\"  I would have loved Michael to cover another Sinatra song because I enjoy the spin his puts on his classics.  Also, he could have created magic with Dean Martin's \\"You're Nobody Till Somebody Loves You\\" if he merely kept the song upbeat.  Anyhow, at this time, I really enjoy \\"Cry Me a River,\\" and his original \\"Haven't Met You Yet.\\"  I'm slowly warming up to the rest.  I guess it's a difficult task to exceed expectations and release a better cd than the previous one, even if you're Michael Buble.
0385504225|1.0|This is more of a take on how I am feeling about reading the book than a review.I don't even know if it is right or fair for me to give my opinion at this point since I am only up to chapter 25. It is just sooooooo boring to me that I can't seem to even want to pick it up and continue reading; it has yet to grab my attention. I keep walking by it and think I should sit down and finish reading it because it might get better but my gut feeling is it won't. I have read a lot of reviews on this and other sites and most reveiws confirm my gut feeling. Since I paid good money for it guess I will try and plod my way through but if you haven't bought it yet and still would like to read it I suggest you not waste your money,  check it out from the library or wait for it to come out in paperback at a half priced book store. To think I was looking so forward to reading this book that I bought it before I asked my friends who bought and read it what they thought. Wish I had waited, could have used the money on something more worthwhile.
0385341008|2.0|I wanted so much to love this book, but it was extremely disappointing, for all the reasons outlined by reviewers who gave it one or, at most, two stars.  Anyone who is interested in a more realistic view of the Channel Islands during the German occupation should go find a DVD of \\"Island at War.\\"  This book has cardboard characters and stilted scenes. Further, there may be epistolary novels that are really well written but this isn't one of them.  The one good thing about the book is the descriptions of Guernsey.

B002C6K7N0|4.0|I highly anticipated Megadeth's Endgame, so when I got it, maybe I was expecting too much from it.  Don't get me wrong, the album has some really well-written and enjoyable music, but to me, it is just too similar to their last effort United Abominations, which I thought was their best album since Cryptic Writings.  Some of the tracks could probably have been on United Abominations.  I guess I was a little disappointed.  Despite all I have said, if you are even just a small fan of Megadeth, I highly recommend you buy Endgame.
B000R7GKQE|4.0|This show is great and definitely worth buying. However there aren't many extras on this set and a show that has been in HD since day one really should be re-released on blu-ray. I do like the ability to watch all the episodes in a row w/o the recap. Other than that it is pretty bare bones.
B0009W5K0Y|5.0|I got to know this album because my friend had it playing in her van every time we'd go somewhere, and eventually it grew on me.  I'm nowhere near a punk-rock type person, but the sentimental value of this album helped get me hooked on it, and from there the songs grew on me one by one.  All We Know - My favorite of the three \\"radio releases\\" from this album.  The catchiness of the chorus will pull you in, and kind of sets the tone for the rest of the CD.  Pressure - Awesome guitar riffs here.  As with the previous song, there is a slowed-down solo on the bridge, and Hayley's vocals are showcased excellently.  Emergency - This was the first song to stand out for me on this album.  It's almost impossible not to get into; even before you really know the lyrics it makes you want to get up and dance.  If you know the back story, it takes on whole new meaning, because this song is supposedly about Hayley dealing with her parents fighting as a child.  Brighter - The first song I heard by this group to have a message.  The theme of \\"You're leaving, but you're awesome and we love you anyway,\\" has been done before, but Hayley puts a new spin on it.  Excellent guitar work on the bridge, as well.  Here We Go Again - It took me a little longer to get into this one (the repetition at the end gets slightly annoying), but this song grew on me nonetheless.  It's one of the catchiest songs on the album, and features one of the best guitar solos I've ever heard.  Never Let This Go - Slightly depressing (\\"Maybe if my heart stops beating, it won't hurt this much\\"), but a pretty song nonetheless.  This one stuck out for me early on.  Whoa - Catchy, and very underrepresented.  I think it gets overlooked in favor of some of the other songs on the album, but I find it to be a fun song.  Heck, I've seen two-year-olds dance to this one.  It's another one that pulls you in.  Conspiracy - Slower than some of the other songs, but excellent lyrics.  In my opinion, it's also one of the easiest oftheir songs to sing to.  Franklin - I found this song boring at first, but have since come to like it as much as the others.  It took me until recently to figure out the meaning of this song, but once you listen to it and know that their hometown is in Franklin, TN, the theme of homesickness becomes pretty self-evident.  A pretty song.  My Heart - Another beautiful song.  I'm not much for the screaming at the end, but that's just because I never did like songs with the \\"possessed screaming\\" in them.  Despite that, this is a very pretty song (as stated before), and could be interpreted as a song to God.  An awesome CD, in other words.  Paramore has grown to become one of my favorite groups this year, and I'm actually going tonight to see them in concert.  Somehow I don't think I'll be disappointed.
0226264211|4.0|Friedman gives some interesting counter-arguments on the welfare state and sometimes socialist economy that exists in the U.S. and why capitalism is the best system.
B001KVZ6F2|5.0|Saw this one in the theater.  Clint Eastwood is a kinda older Dirty Harry persona, with a little bit of Archie Bunker in him--he is not a policeman this time.  He is actually a retired car salesman and former soldier.  The movie begins at his wife's funeral.  He stands in the church, assessing his relatives.  They are just not up to his expectations (granddaughter with piercings and belly hanging out, etc.).  Clint is definitely a character.  He tells it like it is and has a biting sarcastic way of doing it.  He saw his share of \\"action\\" as a Korean War veteran, and is not afraid to stand up to people.  He has guns, too.  Clint has a Hmong (Vietnamese) family living next to him and they become part of the story line, as they eventually become friends.  Clint also stands up to gangbangers and tries to help some neighborhood folks out.  There is also a young, baby-faced Catholic priest that pesters the heck out of Clint because Clint's wife had asked the priest to look after Clint before she went to the other side.  I cannot tell you anymore without ruining the story for you, but it is a great storyline with fine acting.  And you know Clint is one of those actors that can say more than words with just a look. It was a very enjoyable movie.<br /><br />By the way, Grand Torino is a restored Ford.  I think they said 1962-- a beautiful car that Clint's character restored in the movie.

0385504225|2.0|Enough was said in the reviews before this one. The ratings make a strong point for the letdown Dan Brown's fans are feeling.  I think the Masons and the Noetic Science Society tricked Dan into giving them a good write-up, then chasing everyone all over Washington to create a tourist attraction of a very boring city - which even Americans won't visit, just to find that we all should read our bibles/religious scriptures more carefully with 5 guiding words to find yet another secret meaning.  I guess I wanted something \\"fantastical and fancifully\\" instead had to sit through a sermon.
031606792X|5.0|This is an amazing book that transports the reader into a world realistic enough to rival our own. However, I do recommend you read the first three books of the series, in order to better appreciate Breaking Dawn.
1401216676|4.0|I hemmed and hawed over giving this 4 or 5 stars. If Amazon allowed it, I'd have selected 4 1/2. In roughly 48 pages, the story takes you through the Joker's origin (told in flashbacks) and the evil clown's present-day kidnap and torture of comissioner Gordon.<br /><br />The artwork is drop dead amazing. I can't even describe it. It's as if the pages are animated, somehow. They're that vivid. Some old school fans hate how DC let Brian Bolland go back and re-color the latest edition. Me, I love the juxtaposition of the rich present-day colors against the dull monochromes of the flashbacks.<br /><br />Seeing how \\"one bad day\\" transformed an otherwise regular Joe into the evil maniac known as the Joker is poignant (really!). And I can't tell you how tense I felt watching the Joker attempt to do the same thing to Gordon.<br /><br />My only complaint, and the one reason why I can't give this book 5 stars, is that the Joker's torture of Gordon felt rushed. The story sets all of this ground work to prepare you to see one man go through a day of hell. And just when the Joker gets going, he stops! If the Joker had drawn out his torture a bit more, it would've made Gordon's situation seem more dire. I also think it would've helped the conclusion hit with a greater impact than it did.<br /><br />Still, for all that the story does to paint the many facets of the Joker, The Killing Joke is a masterpiece. And since the art is good enough to frame, that pretty much makes The Killing Joke a win-win.

1401207529|5.0|Batman: Year One is probably my favorite Batman trade paperback. The book itself pays more attention to James Gordon (future comissioner) than it does the Batman, and that's OK.<br /><br />Gordon goes through so many ups and downs--his introduction to the corrupt underbelly of Gotham, his developing friendship with Batman, his family coming under attack, and his budding feelings for his female partner... you really see how much inner strength he has. And you totally understand why Batman comes to trust him implicitly later on.<br /><br />Never fear, though... there is enough Batman in here to keep you going. Of particular mention is a showdown with the police that no doubt provided at least some inspiration for the endgame that went down in the recent film rendition of The Dark Knight.<br /><br />The classic style artwork ties it all together. This rendition of Gotham is gritty and realistic, but not in that overly-techie or overly-exaggerated style that many of the other popular Batman tales depict. It hits home because this Gotham COULD exist.<br /><br />Above all, this book isn't hampered by pop-culture references, historical events, or the \\"crossover of the month\\" mentality that has caused other Batman trades and graphic novels to lose their luster over the years. You don't need to know what's going on in the world or in the DC universe to digest this story. Whenever you read it, you feel like it's happening NOW.<br /><br />And the ending... man... Jim Gordon is an A-1 bad mamma jamma. He doesn't need a costume to bust some heads.

B000HC2LI0|5.0|I received this a few weeks ago and was surprised by what was all included. I was just looking for the episodes, and wasn't expecting all the extras it came with. I really like looking over the script for the pilot. I also liked the case the DVD's came in. It's great for storage.

0385504225|4.0|I quite agree with negative comments here, like it's long for the plot, too much explanation on what we already know, too many references of the same tips, etc. But still, it's a page turner and a fun read, was a nice resort during my busy working days to escape from reality. Also, the scientific facts about human mind are interesting. I enjoyed reading it along with touring the National Mall in D.C. on the Google Map.  One thing I would like to suggest to Mr. Brown and his editors is that they were too careless about the name of the female CIA director, Inoue Sato. Although Sato can be either a first name or family name, Inoue is definitely a family name. So, calling a fierce CIA woman director \\"Director Sato\\" which sounds kind of cute for the Japanese was a big error.  After we all know what was going on in the tatooed guy's mind, this book transforms itself to be a self-development and enlightenment book. I didn't want to sleep up to the final scene with the guy and Peter, but after that I kept falling asleep while reading.  I'm giving four stars because this book interested me in the Noetic Science and provided me with a good time reading anyway. Thanks Mr. Brown!
B000VUQ4HW|5.0|Language of the Shadows<br /><br />I picked up the two disc DVD recordings from Kino, Nosferatu, one of the first if not the first filmed version inspired by Bram Stoker's novel, Dracula.<br /><br />Pre-dating Lugosi's thriller, this silent film for me made me fascinated about the techniques of Director F.W. Manau that we take so for granted today.  The interpositions, the flashback, the scene to scene back & forth are all here.<br /><br />This film is praised as an excellent restoration of the 1922 film.  The disc has a great \\"making of\\", not only of the restoration process but also of the life and times of Director Minau.  The film is in the German language but has English intertitles between scenes.  On the second disc there is the same film with the original German intertitles, but don't worry if you don't speak or read German since this has English subtitles.<br /><br />I had no idea that silent film directors use tinting to represent emotion.  My experience with silents has been with Charlie Chaplain and the Keystone Cops.  This film puts them to shame.<br /><br />Did the story scare me?  No, not really.  However the mix of shadow and reality did blur for a time.<br /><br />The story itself follows the similar general theme to Bram Stoker's Dracula but all the names have been changed to protect the innocent (from law suits).  Unfortunately the ploy did not work.  Bram Stoker's widow sued and won and the film was ordered destroyed.  Fortunately some survived so that we have this great piece of film history.<br /><br />It's a love story in a lot of ways.  Kutter and his wife Ellen, sweet & innocent, happy as I've ever seen actors be on film.  The expression of joy was really something to see.  Max Shreck as Count Orlok -- the rat-like features, long nails and pointed ears, looked more like a rat than anything.  (This in great contrast to the later incarnations of Dracula as an aristocrat whom the women adore and whose bite can change others into vampires.)<br /><br />Rather than the bite of a stake, we have the blood & sacrifice of an innocent maid as the cock crows and Orlok vanishes in a puff of smoke.<br /><br />The director was fascinated with occult symbology with plays a big part in the film's storyline.<br /><br />For the horror aficionado, this is a must-see film.  The beginnings of what we take for granted today were pioneered by Manau.  Watch these DVDs and get a taste of what it must have been like to create in a new, untried medium of entertainment and expression.<br /><br />A must-buy!<br /><br />[In my research I also discovered a film called Shadow of the Vampire (2000) starring Willem DaFoe (Spiderman), where this is a back-story of the Nosferatu tale, except Max Schreck turns out to be a centuries old vampire who was hired by Manau!  Sounds crazy, hope it's a tribute!]blood & sacrifice of an innocent maid as the cock crows and Orlok vanishes in a puff of smoke.

0385504225|2.0|I have waited for the novel since he announced the title.  I was looking forward to the thrill that Dan Brown always has provided until now.  Unfortunately, Dan Brown has settle himself to write a winded repetitive text that was more a history of the masons than a plot.  I mention the plot becuase it is a cookie cut copy of both Angels and Demons and The Da Vinci Code.     His writing, on the other hand, provided a beautiful narrative that can be envied by most writers. Dan Brown, change the pattern plot, take risks and take your character to different levels.  Remember, he is no James Bond.
0061719544|5.0|I have been a fan of Craig's for many years. I love anything he does. His show is the only one I tape every night and laugh out loud when I am watching it the next day. I saw him in person a year ago in Columbus, Ohio. Afterwards we went backstage to get autographs. As he was getting into his limo, an older lady fell down off the curb trying to get closer to him. Craig got out of the limo to help her! He is a genuinely kind person with a good heart.<br /><br /> When I started his book last week, reading a couple of chapters each night before bed, I was intrigued, but after a few nights of this, I could not put it down and read through to the end on the fourth day. It was a great book, by an extraordinary man. I felt I knew him already because he talks to the audiance candidly each night, but after reading American On Purpose, I feel I know him even better.<br /><br />  I wish him luck and even more success with his new wife and his career.<br /><br />we love ya, Buddy!
B000W02TDE|5.0|Call Me Irresponsible was bound to hit the charts when it was released; but the two CD version of this release shines even brighter thanks to several more outstanding songs and ballads performed impeccably by Michael Bubl&eacute;. Michael can easily match any crooner of the entire twentieth century. The sound quality is excellent and I love that artwork, too.<br /><br />The first CD starts with Michael singing \\"The Best Is Yet to Come;\\" this number sports a big band style arrangement and Michael never lets go of a single superfluous note! Michael's voice is in exceptional form and the music complements his vocals perfectly. \\"It Had Better Be Tonight\\" has a Latin flavor that works wonders for this ballad; and the brass is used to great advantage. Michael sings \\"It Had Better Be Tonight\\" with energy and enthusiasm--what a strong number! \\"Me and Mrs. Jones\\" by Kenny Gamble, Leon Huff and Cary Grant Gilbert gets a fine treatment by Michael Bubl&eacute; who sings this passionately. You'll definitely want to slow dance with your sweetheart all alone late at night to this tune. \\"Comin' Home Baby\\" is a fine duet between Michael and Boyz II Men; they harmonize and sing this number flawlessly! The piano arrangement is nothing short of perfect and this number is easily a major highlight of the first CD. In addition, \\"Call Me Irresponsible\\" places Michael front and center--and he sings this marvelously. The musical arrangement makes good use of the brass and it all works very well. \\"Everything\\" is yet another fine tune that Michael Bubl&eacute; sings to perfection; listen for \\"Everything;\\" it's beautiful.<br /><br />\\"I've Got the World on a String,\\" a number written by Harold Arlen and Ted Koehler, sounds so fresh and new--Arlen and Koehler would be proud! The backup vocalists do a great job and I really like \\"I've Got the World on a String.\\" \\"That's Life,\\" a number Frank Sinatra liked to sing, has Michael singing this very well; and it's just as enjoyable as when Frank sang it. The background vocalists are great although Michael never really needs backup. The first CD ends with Michael Bubl&eacute; performing \\"Dream.\\" \\"Dream\\" is a classic pop tune that Michael does with heart and soul every step of the way. \\"Dream\\" gets a lovely treatment from Michael and it provides a sweet ending for the first CD.<br /><br />The second CD continues the outstanding music. \\"Stuck in the Middle with You\\" has a terrific arrangement and Michael sings this with all his heart and soul--what energy, too! He really makes this work! The percussion enhances the jazzy arrangement that works so very well for this tune and overall \\"Stuck in the Middle with You\\" is a strong highlight of the second CD. There's an \\"international pop mix\\" of the gorgeous ballad entitled \\"Lost;\\" Michael takes this all the way and I love his passionate delivery of \\"Lost.\\" The strings are used well, too. \\"Home\\" also sounds quite moving when Michael does it--great! \\"Orange Colored Sky\\" is a song I first heard performed by Nat \\"King\\" Cole; Michael does justice to this tune with a memorable performance and he handles complex tempo and key changes like a pro! \\"Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!\\" is very easy on the ear; and I really like Michael's rendition of \\"The Christmas Song.\\" Michael really sounds great on \\"The Christmas Song;\\" and just one listen proves it! The second CD ends strong with Michael Bubl&eacute; performing \\"White Christmas;\\" this melancholy classic sounds heavenly when Michael sings it and that piano arrangement is very elegant.<br /><br />Michael Bubl&eacute; fans will, naturally, want this in their collections. Fans of classic pop vocals will also find a lot to like on this album.

1592401791|5.0|For anyone who grew up with the Beatles as their official or unofficial soundtrack this book written by recording engineer Geoff Emerick will be fascinating to say the least. Most everyone else interested in the group should find it a good read as well. First of all, let me just say that Mr. Emerick's memory is thankfully amazing as I am assuming that most of what he recalls here is at least fairly accurate. It is the recollection of one man who was fortunate enough to have witnessed two of our lifetime's true geniuses at work on several of their masterpieces.     I thoroughly enjoyed and could relate to his introductory chapters where he describes his budding interest in a field outside that of the mainstream. His writing, although a bit redundant at times, takes on a balanced and entertaining tone. True, his memoirs may seem overly subjective on occasion but one must remember that this is an extremely personal account.     A word of caution to some readers who may not want to know some of the finer details behind such great musical works. Some of Emerick's revelations are similar in ways akin to the many documentaries that show us how film makers achieve their cinematic magic through special effects and other such techniques. At the same time, it is a partial history lesson in the evolution of studio and sound technique that should be particularly interesting to musicians.     Lastly, I must say that I found several passages deeply moving. His intimate recollection of four historical icons tapped into my own fond memories of the band as I grew up. Especially poignant is his description of John and Paul, amid the turmoil of the latter portion of the Beatles' career, harking back to the old days and their boyhood friendship. This book succeeds on many levels and I highly recommend it.
B0029LHW4U|4.0|I'm not going to get into a long drawn-out review on this.  This stands up there with any of the great AIC records.  Good plyaing, good vocals (lead and background) and great songs.  VERY WELL WORTH THE MONEY!  I'm thankful the guys decided to do this record, and hope there are many more.  Go out and buy it... I highly doubt you'll be unhappy you did.

B001KVZ6FW|5.0|Pixar has done it again! I have to admit when I saw the previews, etc for this movie, I wasn't really excited to see it. It didn't look very interesting to me. Boy did my opinion change when I saw it again. I loved this movie. I was deeply touched as I followed the life of the little boy explorer who grew up with the cute little girl by his side. I loved watching their life together, and felt for him when his dear wife departed. What a fun adventure it was to fly around in his house with the little boy scout.   How sad it was when this grown old man, finally meets his hero, only to find out that he was the villan. Great movie for all ages!
0385504225|5.0|As usual, Dan Brown holds our interest through a less than 24 hour time span of chase, intrigue, mayhem, total disruption of lives and complete surprise for the fantastic ending.  This novel, in my estimation, is on a par with, or slightly exceeds his previous efforts.  Unfortunately, I read the book in less than two days so I will be required to wait for an indeterminant amount of time for his next novel.  Fantastic story-teller and one of my favorites.
0385504225|2.0|Dan Brown certainly departed from writing gripping tales that keep you interested from beginning to end. This book was so predictable that half way through you knew what plot was about to unfold. The ending was so dissapointing that I re-read the final 10 chapters over again to see if I missed something. The only way my friends and I could describe this book was think Mr Rogers meets Silence of the Lambs in the worst possible sense.
B002BSHWUU|4.0|As not only a Beatles fanatic and audiophile, I am very satisfied with the product delivered here.   Are these recordings hindered by their format (CD?  Yes.  But, it is unreasonable to assume, given the very small number of people who have the better formats ie SACD, DAT, and Blu-ray, to expect the availability in them.  The Beatles sought wide appeal and the choice of download and CD guarantees the widest distribution.      The packaging of each album is superb.  But, overtime I do question how they will hold up AND how much damage the rough paper will do to the surface of the CD with repeated disc removal.    This is a great set for the beginning Beatlemaniac.
030738683X|3.0|I had not thought of Austen as a satirist prior to reading Northanger Abbey. Within the first chapter the author addresses what the book is not - a gothic romance, thought it is fashioned similarly, and named similarly. Austen points out the heroine's father did not lock up his daughters, there was no lover of unknown origin, (something Emily Bronte uses years later in Wuthering Heights), and the heroine's mother does not warn her of the seduction of barons. Rather, when the teenage heroine, Catherine Morland, leaves for a resort town to stay with neighbors, everything is done \\"with a degree of moderation and composure, which seemed rather consistent with the common feelings of common life...\\" 6. With the contrasts Austen makes to the typical gothic romance she conveys the message that life is not like the popular novel.<br /><br />Austen makes some straight forward comments in Northanger Abbey, without irony. Throughout the book she comments on novels, a rather new and popular form in the late 18th century. The novel, evidently, was looked down on, but was also a guilty pleasure. A person would suggest reading Milton or Pope or Addison, but would condemn books by Anne Radcliffe. Even novelists would do this. But Austen, as narrator, would not. She does, however, illustrate problems for those who read such novels, as the character Catherine experiences. Catherine is disappointed that Northanger Abbey isn't ancient nor dark nor in ruins. She is terribly mistaken in her perception of General Tilney, suspecting he has imprisoned his wife in the Abbey, based on what she had read in novels. I'm not sure if all statements of judgment are ironic or not.<br /><br />The satire is strong only in a few chapters of the book. Otherwise it is something of the standard Austen work, with characters pairing up according to society's expectations, then finding out they are mismatched. Though no one may expect Catherine to be a heroine, she is a very good character, practical, sociable, yet refraining from coquetry, earnest. The book tells of her maturation through the age of courtship.ing from coquetry, earnest. The book tells of her maturation through the age of courtship.
B001TOD92C|5.0|This really should be required viewing for all professional athletes.    I picked this up on a whim.  I passed it over many times on the rental shelves, thinking it was just another action movie with wrestling as the \\"theme\\" this time.  A mistake I'm glad I made this time.    Mickey REALLY ought to come up for Oscar nominations with this one.  His portrayal of a washed up professional wrestler, 20 years later, is just stunning and poignant.    The film is shot much in the way of a documentary, and it really presents the story in nitty-gritty detail.    All these guys - from WFW, to MMA - ought to watch this movie and realize that twenty (if not just ten) years down the road, they will likely arrive there with nothing to show for it except the realization that they've arrived empty-handed, and it's too late to do anything about that - no matter how badly they wish things could be different.

B002BSHXJA|5.0|It's great to hear the best music ever recorded as it was originally intended. Sounds better than I remember the vinyl, since that medium was fraught with warping and dust. Haven't heard the mono version (far superior to stereo) of Sgt. Pepper in 40 years and had never heard the mono mix of the white album (also much better). Don't waste your money on 60's stereo; this is the real deal.
076532413X|2.0|The story is based on a very interesting concept and is well written but I just found it totally unrealistic and boring.  Normally I don't have a problem with \\"unrealistic\\" except when a writer in every effort and vein of his book is trying to make something unplausible seem \\"realistic\\" and plausible.  I'm sorry there is no way I will buy that something like this could ever be explained by \\"science\\" or worse - be caused by it.  There is a spiritual element that needed to be included in this story that wasn't there - and that missing element is why this story is so silly.  Also - does Sawyer really expect me to believe that man has the ability to make the flashforward event described in this book possible?  Or that man will have the ability in and of himself to become immortal?  It's just ludicrous to me - and it made it very hard for me to enjoy this book.<br /><br />The characters seemed shallow and uninteresting to me as well.  Thankfully I am one who will not let such a book influence how I feel about physists, because the scientists portrayed in this book were superficial, self-serving and boring. Sawyer has done nothing to improve upon the undeserved sterotype of the boring and smug super-smart scientist as far as I am concerned.  One of the characters - Theo - is disappointed that his future apparantly doesn't include his getting the Nobel prize which is nothing more than a sign of arrogance.  So I found myself really not caring what happened to this character - yet he was one of the main characters in the story.<br /><br />Frankly none of the characters were very likable or interesting and the journey this book takes you on - though thought provoking - isn't really worth the time.
031604461X|5.0|Well, okay, so i keep saying to myself, why would anyone give this a 1 star review? It may have something to do with me as a person reading this saga. If i was going to read 2500 pages for Bella and Edward to die in some Shakespearian tragedy type way i may have drank some poison myself. With that being said, I really loved Breaking Dawn. Did i have some issues? Absolutely, the consummating love scene  when Bella was human could have been much better than fade to black, but, i thought that Stephenie more than made up for it  with the many scenes after Bella was a vampire! I thought the conversations surrounding the lovemaking was hilarious and heartwarming. The pillowcases and the destroyed lingerie descriptions made me smile and felt like i was a person in the room! Now, i would have enjoyed a more passionate, romantic, lust of a changing for Bella. And yes, the birth thing was a bit much but, i thought well done! People have said that Breaking Dawn was anti-climatic. I thought the exact opposite. Would i have enjoyed a more action filled scene, maybe. But, i have to admit that it worked for me. When we first met Bella she was a clumsy, uncoordinated girl who thought she was \\"average\\" and nothing special. Then she meets Edward and they overcome so many obstacles to finally be together. When she does become a vampire she is the \\"perfect\\" vampire... she doesn't have the \\"newborn\\" instincts and she has an important gift that saves Edward. It confirmed to me that meeting Edward did not only provide her with her immortal soulmate but, it was her destiny to more than an average human but to be a glorious vampire. I really enjoyed this book and i thought that Stephenie Meyer did right by her Edward, Bella and the many fans of ranging ages.
B001FB4VZS|5.0|The DVDs are nice to watch because you can follow the story line in the sequence that the stories were written.  Even my wife who does not like science fiction is starting to watch the shows with me.
B00288KNL8|3.0|Last evening my husband and I watched this with my 9 and 7 year old.  My 9 year old was fine, but the 7 year old was creeped out.  I didn't appreciate how much until I stayed up all night with him because he was scared -- and although I am surprised at the degree of his reaction, I do understand why the movie concept resulted in his fear.  The movie may be \\"pleasantly dark\\" for tweens, older children, and adults, but the concept of another alternate reality (with bad people scheming to take little children away from their parents) behind a little door in your house is probably too much for 2nd and some third graders (and yes, I should have known better).  So, avoid our example and please exercise good judgement on this one!
B000Z6MIQS|5.0|This CD seems a little more grown up then earlier releases. Every song is a good tune. Great Purchase
B002KDUDG6|5.0|This CD is a winner!  Apparently he made the bold decision to record this collection with a live band in the studio and the result comes through as fun, organic and unique - a refreshing change from the often sterile recordings that come out of the studio for so many vocalists.  It's difficult to pick a favorite... \\"Some Kind of Wonderful\\" is amazing, warm, and fun and stayed with me for hours after listening to it during an afternoon run; \\"At This Moment\\" is as powerful as Billy Vera and the Beaters in its own, haunting, yearning uniquely Bublé way; \\"Crazy Love\\" is a fantastic tribute to Van Morrison's original; \\"Hold On\\" is a beautiful, poignant love song apparently from a guy with a hurting heart; he does admirable crooner justice to the incomparable \\"Georgia on My Mind\\" and his vocals on \\"Stardust\\" (with Naturally 7) are pure and simple silk - gorgeous!  My least favorite track is \\"Heartache Tonight,\\" maybe included for some sort of thematic integrity. The rest of the CD is pure pleasure, filled with fun and feeling, and sure to please fans of Bublé, old and new!

0143038419|1.0|Bought this book, as heard it was good, well about 50 of the 334 pages are actually good.  Who does the author think she is, a Saint?  Hint if all you want to read is someone endlessly complain about everything under the sun, then you will LOVE this book. Actually this is so hard to read, bores you to tears and HINT here Saints DID NOT complain.  Not only complaining, who told this writer she could even write?  Her grammar is poor, the metaphores make no sense, the descriptions leave you lacking that the entire Italian trip had me hating Italy...and I used to love the place.  The movie on imdb does not sound like this book and let's hope they are throwing million of dollars away on a better story, this is just HORRIBLE.  A very, very, very poorly, badly written book.  I really want my money back!
B001EN71DG|5.0|Everyone knows about the Movies... they're awesome.  This Trilogy is the best version of the movies because it has both the original theatrical feature length releases on the DVD and another DVD that has the enhanced digital re-release with extra 3d scenes etc.  Altogether it's 6 DVDs total in the package, 3 original version, 3 of the digitally enhanced version. I happen to be a fan of the original without any of the new stuff but you get the best of both worlds in this trilogy.

Let's just say that this is the best way to listen to the beatles music the way they intended their music to be listened to. The mono mixes are the original ones on which, for most of them, the Band worked on. So ? Go Mono!!!!

B0027REDK2|5.0|Note: This is a review of the 2009 two-disc Collector's Edition of Rio on CD.  The 2015 2-CD Deluxe Edition re-release features the same song selection and audio mastering as the 2009 release, but different packaging.<br /><br />This is the third CD release of the Rio album, and it compiles the original UK LP release of the album, the US Kershenbaum remixes, some original demos, as well as b-sides, non-album singles and Night Versions. Because there are literally dozens of versions of certain songs from the album, no one release will ever encompass all of them, but this one comes as close as any one release ever has, and most likely ever will.<br /><br />Unlike the previous CD releases, the version on this disc is the original UK LP release of the album. Essentially, the UK album is identical to the previous CD issues, with three exceptions: (1) The version of &#34;Lonely In Your Nightmare&#34; appearing on this disc is a different mix than that featured on the earlier CDs, with different vocal and instrument levels, and a generally more ambient and diffuse sound. (2) The version of &#34;Hold Back the Rain&#34; is virtually the same as the &#34;remix&#34; version on the &#34;Save a Prayer&#34; disc in the Singles Box, but with a slightly different mix and much better sound. This version is dramatically different from the ones featured on the previous Rio CDs. (3) Finally, &#34;Save a Prayer&#34; is nearly the same as the version appearing on the earlier CDs, but with a slightly different edit at the end, on Simon's &#34;Save a prayer 'til the morning after&#34; refrain. This is not the same as the mix used for the video (which has never appeared on any album or single, unfortunately), but is closer to it than any version previously available on CD. Whether or not this is the &#34;best&#34; version of the Rio album is subjective, but insofar as it was the version first issued on LP in the UK, which was the version Nick Rhodes and producer Colin Thurston mixed together, it is the most historically correct, and likely the most definitive.<br /><br />Soundwise, this is arguably the best this album has ever sounded. This newest mastering is actually closer to the original CD mastering from the '80s than to the 2001 remaster. Compared to the '80s CD, the 2001 remaster greatly enhanced the higher frequencies present on the master tape, and as such sounded much brighter - arguably too bright.  It also had much more tape hiss, and lost a certain degree of focus and tightness. Compared to the '01 remaster, the sound on this latest mastering is considerably tighter and more focused, and with much less hiss, but without sounding artificially processed by noise reduction techniques; it sounds natural and balanced.  The new mastering also has more thrust, presence and sonic impact than the earlier '80s mastering, while still being brighter sounding. In effect, it combines the best of both worlds.<br /><br />The Kershenbaum mixes are their own thing. Some are outstanding - his mix of &#34;Lonely In Your Nightmare&#34; is definitive - whereas some are just OK. To a greater or lesser extent, all of them capitalize on details not present in the original album mixes, and cause the listener to hear the music differently. Unfortunately, none of them sound very good compared to the polish of the original album mixes. Textures are thick and muddled, obscuring the wonderful engineering Colin Thurston used in recording the multitrack tapes, which was preserved in the original mixes. Nevertheless, these are the versions many fans have been hungering for for years, and this is the best these versions are ever likely to sound. Note: the Kershenbaum remix of &#34;Hungry Like the Wolf&#34; on disc one is the rare U.S.#2 album remix, which was quickly replaced by the Night Version of the song on subsequent pressings. It makes its CD debut here, as does the Kershenbaum mix of &#34;Lonely in Your Nightmare.&#34;<br /><br />The best packaging a Rio CD ever gotwas the limited edition mini-LP gatefold for the 2001 remastered CD. That version featured an outstanding reproduction of the album cover, and also included the second Nagel painting the band had commissioned on the cover of the lyrics booklet, along with a separate inner sleeve for the CD, and a gorgeous reproduction of the gatefold photo. This latest version doesn't quite approach the grace of the earlier issue, even though it is more comprehensive in terms of content. For one, the cover is not as rich in its color palette; colors are more muted than on the more highly saturated and warmer-hued 2001 sleeve. This release has a more comprehensive booklet with thorough liner notes and many, many photos - some of which are anachronistic, clearly coming from different periods of the band's development. (Ironically, out of the many images in the booklet, the second Nagel painting is notably absent.)  Unfortunately, the fixed sleeves for the CDs are quite tight, and will likely make disc scratching an issue if one is not careful. Generally, it is a nice package, but doesn't do quite the same justice to the original, innovative design of Malcom Garret as the earlier mini-LP gatefold design did. However, I would say this package is superior to any previous versions of the CD available in jewel boxes - although at least jewel boxes won't scratch the discs in them.<br /><br />Beyond the Kershenbaum mixes of &#34;Lonely In Your Nightmare&#34; and &#34;Hungry Like the Wolf,&#34; as well as two of the cuts on the album itself, there is scant little in this package that has not been made available on CD before, either on the Night Versions disc, or the Singles box. The four demos on the second disc are newly available, and are worth a listen once or twice through, but grow tedious pretty quickly. The rest of the songs - which include the 7-inch and Night Versions of &#34;My Own Way,&#34; the b-sides &#34;Like an Angel&#34; and &#34;The Chauffeur (Blue Silver),&#34; and variousother Night Versions and remixes - have all been available before on CD. However, by compiling them here, this collection provides an exhaustive look at the various incarnations of Duran Duran's music from this period. Add in a unique, superior mastering for the album tracks, and a handful of key mixes unavailable on any other CD release, and the result is a collection that will prove invaluable for fans of this band's finest hour.
B002BSHXJA|5.0|I did not buy this boxset to claim that Mono is better than Stereo. I bought it because I thought it was the most faithful recreation in packaging and music of the originals, and I wanted to feel like the kids did back in the 60s; as I am 18 and never had the chance to listen to The Beatles in vinyl or live.     If you listen to the record in chronological order it is amazing how obvious the changes are in musical and fashion style (if you look at the LP Replica slips). The audio quality I think is great, although being used to listening to mp3´s and recently changing to Lossless formats, I thought the audio was muddy without equalizing. But after noticing less ear fatigue while listening to the music uncompressed and unequalized, I decided to copy this collection to my iTunes in Apple Lossless format (this is in the advanced option of importing).     With a great set of speakers you can notice the backing vocals better and, for example, Ringo´s panderetta in some songs, or other subtle notes and instruments, that actually change the music a lot if you are listening to it without any other distractions. When listening with my Bose QC 2 headphones, those subtle changes became major improvements and I got used to the high quality of the music.      Trying to compare Mono to Stereo after reading all the audiophiles ranting on about which one is better, I can only say they are different. I think if you buy the Mono Boxset and read the essay inside by Kevin Howlett, you will know which discs you should also buy in Stereo to add as a complement to the mono set.    My only complaint is that the albums that were not originally pressed in Mono were not included in Stereo outside of the boxset (Yellow Submarine, Abbey Road, Let it Be), considering that you are paying more for this set than the stereo, that is a ripoff, and also that you do not get the DVD's with the mini documentaries.    The actual box is a small white glossy box where the cd's slide out from the side. Each disc is packed inside a plastic slipcase with adhesive, and the disc inside comes with two slipcases, one transparent plastic one and a LP replica slipcase which is beautiful. I can swear the boxset and slipcases have some kind of perfume on them, much like new books have smells these CDs do too. The pictures that come without any digital enhancements (allegedly) look more natural than the over saturated and gamma-filled pictures of the Stereo boxset, and come without the black sidebar with the Apple logo on them.     After listening to the DESS (Dr. Ebbett's) Blue boxset FLAC's and comparing them with the 2009 boxset, I appreciated the lack of stylus hiss in the 2009 set, and the subtle limiting of the audio makes the treble and higher pitches of the voices and the guitars come out a little more, although it makes this boxset still not 100% faithful to the original.     Being my first Beatles boxset, I think I got the best that is out there today and what you get is well worth the cost. For any Beatles diehard fan, or any person who wants to discover them now like I did, I recommend this boxset that is way past an introduction to The Beatles, it is almost everything they did.
0061537969|2.0|I was disappointed by this book. To be honest, the title and the synopsis caught my eye. The idea for the story seems unique, original and exciting: a story told through the eyes of a dog. However, I could not get too far into the story before my interest was lost. I read half the book and gave it up (a RARE thing for me). Too much drama, too much soap opera and not enough talent to hold the story up. For dog stories I recommend the book that at first I did not buy because I bought this one instead: Merle's Door by Ted Kerasote. So far loving every page of THAT book.

B000784WMW|5.0|During the first half of the 19th century, two of the three Brontë sisters wrote books that have endured as great British literature. The middle sister, Emily, wrote _Withering Heights,_ which became one of the golden year, 1939's, films, Charlotte Brontë, the eldest, wrote the great romance, Jane Eyre, whic has been issued in multiple editions, and filmed 19 times.<br /><br />The plot is simple:  a \\"plain\\" young woman, having spent 10 years in an emotionally sterile, still manages to capture the heart of an equally plain man 20 years her senior, loses him, and then, in the end finds him again, after his mad wife has burned down his manor house, taking his eye and hand in the process.  This is not the ordinary meat of a great romance, but somehow over the years, millions of people throughout the world have read and watched this story and come away moved.<br /><br />In this mini-series, the 16th filmed version, Timothy Dalton plays Rochester to Zelah Clarke's Jane.  Dalton is probably one of the ugliest handsome men I've ever seen who nevertheless has played the central character is a number of films (remember his two James Bond movies?).  Clarke is a wonderful character actress, and probably the closest to Brontë's decision.  Each of them do expert performances, playing their characters with warmth, humor and great passion.  The sexual tension, never brought to fruition on screen, creates a longing that transfers itself to the viewer.<br /><br />Dalton's character, believing he will never find real love, growls and snaps at everyone around him, never compromises to the world, and unable to show kindness to his \\"natural\\" child, Ad&eacute;le or any of his servants.  However, his willingness to bring an illegitimate daughter into his house, to be raised as a daughter shows his great heart But as Jane begins to fill his world with a shy joy, he that heart to soften to her.<br /><br />None of the Brontë sisters ever married.  It was only through their romances that they could draw their ideal men. The saddest thing about their heroes is that they are all drawn from the withdrawn father who could not show them love.  Their stories are testaments to their beliefs that a gentle woman could change such men's personalities, a dream none of them was able to fulfill.<br /><br />Men and women can related to this romance.  Find yourself curled up in your love's arms, crying for the cries of a different time and different kind of story that, I hope, you will never experience.e saddest thing about their heroes is that they are all drawn from the withdrawn father who could not show them love.

B000002UAX|5.0|In his July, 2004 review, Mr. Rugo shows considerable knowledge of what went into the making of the Beatles music and has a few interesting insights as well. However, his half hearted praise and overly harsh criticism of McCartney is way off base. He refers to songs such as \\"Blackbird,\\" \\"I Will\\" and \\"Mother Nature's Son\\" as being among his \\"mildest, sweetest songs,\\" whereas  \\"Honey Pie,\\" \\"Martha, My Dear\\" and \\"Rocky Raccoon\\" are \\"syrupy music hall kitsch,\\" and his overall assessment is:  \\"None of McCartney's tracks here are deep.\\" First of all, Paul said that \\"Blackbird\\" is a political allegory about the civil rights movement in the United States during the sixties. If one is aware of that, and the vast majority of serious Beatles fans are, it brings in another level of meaning to the song. Moreover, it adds additional poignancy. \\"Blackbird\\" is beautiful and deep. Next, \\"I Will\\" was written for Linda McCartney; Paul poetically expresses the depth of his love. Yes, \\"Honey Pie\\" is a tribute to twenties music hall tunes, but it is sweet and delightful. \\"Martha, My Dear\\" is a bouncy piano rocker and \\"Rocky Raccoon\\" is a satirical western pastiche. Neither of the last two fall into the syrupy kitsch category and only cynics would classify \\"Honey Pie\\" that way. Granted, most of McCartney's \\"White Album\\" songs are light escapist fare but he was also capable of deep thoughts and feelings. Let us not forget that this is also the man who wrote deep songs such as \\"Eleanor Rigby,\\" \\"Here, There and Everywhere,\\" \\"For No One,\\" \\"The Fool on the Hill\\" and \\"Hey Jude.\\" Just because McCartney loved lighthearted songs doesn't mean he ought to be continually maligned for lacking depth. One can be serious and one can have fun, the two moods are not mutually exclusive and great art can be created in either category. By the way, Lennon did not write \\"Helter Skelter.\\" That was Paul's. As for what he was writing about, I'm not sure. However, this reviewer would never be so arrogant as to sayit is \\"completely empty of meaning.\\" For his part, Lennon could be lighthearted too, as in his self described \\"teenage social comment song,\\" \\"The Continuing Story of Bungalow Bill.\\" Lastly, don't forget about George, he really comes through here, and don't skip over Paul's \\"Why Don't We Do It in the Road ?,\\" Not only does he play all the instruments on this virile rocker but his vocal phrasing is brilliant and funny. \\"Good Night, \\" John's tender lullaby, was written for Ringo and is also worth a listen. However, skip \\"Revolution 9;\\" Yoko pushed John to do this jumbled mess of electronic sounds.
0765322889|2.0|This is a relatively simple tale, even if there are quite a few characters and storylines of different backgrounds ie. humans, mages etc.. However it pales into insignificance beside authors like George R.R. Martin. The author has a soaring imagination, and is to be congratulated on persisting over 8 years in order to get this novel published, but soon after commencing to read the book it becomes rather obvious why he suffered so long it getting the work published. The writing is somewhat juvenile in nature, the dialogue especially weak and often obtuse and meaningless in the context of the story. However, I assume this first novel was written when the author was quite young, so I grant that the more recent books in the series (with book 8 being now released) are of a much more mature and experienced nature, and are therefore most likely to be very enjoyable for those who have stayed the course, which will not be me, unfortunately. Great imagination, good ideas, shallow execution.

0307386171|3.0|This is a very sad and depressing novella.  Ian McEwan tells the story of a young couple who marry and then are unable to consumate their marriage due to the young woman's utter terror at the possibility and the young man's inability to comprehend the situation. When they are dating they feel the need to marry in order to conform to their idea of a successful life, but the realities of what is needed for a marriage to flourish, understanding, patience, honesty, are the qualities that they do not possess.  When they run into thier\\"brick wall\\" in their marital bed, they make no effort to cope with the issue but instead go their seperate ways, resigned to the failure as an acceptable alternative to breaking down the barriers they have built.

Having said that I just did not get the feeling of \\"urgency\\" -- the life and death in the balance that I had with Angels and Demons and Da Vinci Code. The science in the book was a little much in my opinion.  Kind of hard for me to get inot-- that may have had something to do with my opinion.  It was a decent read, just not great.
B001HYW03S|5.0|Hi most people only know me as Dan. Well i bought season 8  the complete set on DVD's I had all ready watched and taped it on VCR's but DVD's are so great the quality is so much better and easy to use. Have season 1-8 got them right here on Amazon.com Do have a lot of time to use as i wish love watching Smallville, Have been a fan of the comet books as far back as i can remember. After working 3.5 life times in every country on the planet and retired at age 36  then just a few years later this show started up and for the first time realized that Tom Welling after seeing the first show it was so great that even the people that write it and all the other one to come are for the first time in history bringing the people that i had met in all the places had been giving them a reason for a united world. This show is so great it stands out and makes people have hope through the actors. Have talked to people every where and they all agree, it has a Hugh affect on there children to try and do some thing about the wrongs they see every day. The show is about self sacrifice, freedom, and hope that they need the values of in this messed up world. If it changes 10 out of 30 people to try and do the right thing and help others out keep up the faith every one. Just wish they had not moved the time slot to Friday from Thursday who knows might stop a lot of the fans, teen's from going out and getting hurt. Love the show like a lot of other people a round the world do keep up the the great work you are doing. Tom  your a great actor for the part in the show.  Biggest fan, Dan
0780619951|5.0|I saw this movie back when it came out in theaters, and it was very freaky, I just watched it again, and it was still disturbing. The makeups were very creepy,and realistic. The acting was top notch. You could just feel the dread building up. There is just an uneasiness about this movie. You know everything is not gonna be alright at the end. And it was clear that alot of deformed people were hired to appear in the monster costumes gives it a more horrible, genetically mutated look. And that little tiny dude, that plays the piano with Brando would probably give me a heart attack if he strolled across my living room un announced! This is a dark, well made movie that should be seen by all Horror & Fantasy fans. Oh yeah, I guess the CGI rat monsters in the boat were supposed to be the comic relief.
B002KDUDG6|5.0|This is my favorite Michael Buble CD so far!  I have been a big fan since the release of his second CD and love the fact that he sings old standards as well as new music.  Stardust with Naturally 7 is wonderful and reminds me of the original Frank Sinatra version.  Crazy Love is beautiful and who can resist the new tunes, Hold On and Haven't Met You Yet?  As someone from the generation between Michael's peers and his beloved grandparents, I really appreciate hearing old as well as new songs. This is what makes him marketable to a variety of audiences.  Keep doing what you are so very good at!

B0029LHW4U|5.0|This review may be bias since I've followed this band since their inception. I still have a T-Shirt I bought back in '93. Alice and Chains has always been to me the Led Zeppelin of the 90's. They are known more for their \\"Metal\\" and heavier stuff, but half their catalog is acoustic. I remember the day Layne Staley died back in 2002. I was stationed in Germany. It wasn't the shock it was when Kurt Cobain died. It seemed expected. I was surprised that he died before Scott Weiland, though. Layne Staley was awesome. I had always thought that Jerry Cantrell WAS Alice in Chains. I changed my mind after listening to Mad Season. After Layne died, I was glad to see Jerry Cantrell move on as a solo artist and leave the legacy of \\"Alice in Chains\\" alone. I read about them doing a reunion show and was curious to see how they could do it. I never in my right mind would have thought they would be able to pull it off. I then heard they got William DuVall and in interviews, Jerry was going on and on about how good this guy is. I kept hearing how good this cd was and I finally actually paid for it. As usual, the first listen kinda goes by without alot of reaction, but after the third listen, I was hooked! ALICE IN CHAINS IS BACK! Misery, Hollowness, Gloom, Hope, erratic bursts of metal. It's all there. It's almost scary how much William DuVall sounds like Layne Staley, without trying to imitate him. I am so blown away at the intensity of this.

B002KQ6BT6|1.0|i was incredibly disappointed in this book.if you are expecting anything as exciting as angels and demonns or  the da vince code forget it. dont pay a penny for this book if you must read  it go to the library.
B000NU2CY4|4.0|Theres no grain visible in the blu-ray version, but who cares, grain makes HD look like low quality SD. I want a sharp wow factor, not technically accurate film reproduction (in terms of grain, color and blacks = more important). Watched this on: Pioneer BDP-51FD Blu-ray player > Pioneer Elite SC-07 Receiver > Pioneer Kuro PDP-6020FD. This looks great unless you want grain, you cant notice any enhanced edges or smudging. Wish I hadnt read all the reviews since it made me look for it during the movie. Extended version of the movie is not worth watching, far too long and adds nothing interesting, mostly dialog with the emperor. One scene of more arrows compared to theatrical.
1582701709|2.0|This book, \\"The Secret\\" probably is very helpful to some people-those that are economically-secure, privilged, and have never had a severe medical/psychiatric illness or never experienced devastating trauma. Positive thinking has been shown to help people-this is no \\"secret\\". There may be some truth in the claims that changing your thinking will help to bring about changes in your life. Ever heard of Cognitive therapy? This may be effective for some people, those that have the capacity, time, and resources to invest in changing their thinking. However, if you are a person without food, shelter, and safety, a self-help method such as this is utterly useless. For example, you are a homeless mentally-ill woman. Should you imagine yourself in a beautiful mansion? Then keep imagining it in your mind! The universe will create the conditions so that you have a perfect home! Come on! If it were that easy-than there would be NO homeless persons, NO AIDS, NO starvation, NO floods, NO Holocaust, NO chlid abuse, etc...etc....Sorry this rubbish! I must also say that the idea that such persons who have severe illness, trauma, and are subject to oppression and abuse CAUSED these events to happen to them is morally unexcusable!!! How about compassion, empathy, and just general good-will? Since The Secret is obviously more marketed to middle-class Americans, wouldn't it make sense to encourange these folks to be kind to others as well as towards themselves?
0671015206|5.0|As Dave Ramsey puts it, if you want to become thin, you should look at how thin people eat and exercise, and you should eat and exercise the way they do.     Similarly, if you want to become rich, you should look at how rich people live their lives (ie, living below their means, etc.).
B002NXSRVG|1.0|Worst Action Movie for the summer of 2009, if you think that this movie goes with the G. I. Joe cartoon and Comic books of the 80's.  You are dead wrong, nothing like it at all.  Just don't waste your time and money on this movie.

0375413405|5.0|Like many American children watching Julia Child on PBS was my first inkling that there may be more to cooking than what Mom was dishing up each night.  Here was food that did not involve roasts cooked into submission or recipes incorporating processed cheese food, whipped cream from a can, jello or marshmallows. As a young adult Julia Child remained in the back of my mind as I learned how to cook for myself and my family.  Oddly my collection of cookbooks never included this one until, like many others, went to see 'Julie and Julia'.  I tracked down this first volume of Child's magnum opus and discovered so many have discovered before me - this is a GREAT COOKBOOK.    Child's directions are quite clear, gently leading in logical, easy to follow steps through the recipes.  Each section is prefaced with introductions and explanations of not only technique but theory and selection of ingredients.  The book in general strikes a happy medium of writing in a simple enough manner that a novice cook can follow while still being entertaining and engaging enough not to bore a more a more accomplished one.      That is not to say though that there are not problems.  This book first appeared nearly fifty years ago and times have changed.  No mention is made of  microwaves or slow cookers  (although Julia apparently had access to those then cutting edge appliances - blenders and food processors).  Child was never concerned with calories or grams of fat only with the delicious end results.  The most glaring change though is that the recipes assume that the cook has ample room to store and income to purchase an amazing array of specialized equipment and has several hours to devote to putting a meal on the table.    Even with this problems though this is a wonderful cookbook.  It may not be practical to use on a daily basis but for those times when only the best will do this is a must.
0061537969|5.0|Garth Stein is obviously a dog lover. The ability to spin a tale from the perspective of a dog can only be achieved by someone who has spent many years of their life around \\"man's best friend\\". The story was compelling enough, but the manorisms of our friendly \\"star\\" were translated into how a dog actually is able to plan every move, apologize for his inadequacies, rationalize his mistakes, revel in his love for the human race, and saunter around with his head held high after having achieved specific goals.     The reader laughs and cries through a series of events revolving around the prinicpal character's love for car racing. This book is filled with emotion. It is a breath of fresh air at a time when we need to translate hope into dreams fulfilled.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|When I bought this series for my family, I thought it would be a good way to spend time together in the evenings, while adding a little education about our world. I had no idea that the series would be so engaging and entertaining!<br /><br />My kids, then in middle school, loved every minute. My husband and I were also surprised at how much we enjoyed each episode. I had thought I would knit while watching, but my knitting needles sat idle through the first episode and I never bothered taking them out for rest of the series.<br /><br />The footage is stunning and David Attenborough's narration is superb. Not only did we all enjoy watching the DVDs, but they prompted lively discussion afterward. The Planet Earth Diaries section at the end of each episode tells a bit about the filming and showed us just how difficult it was to capture this amazing footage.
B000002P5R|4.0|i think this cd is an amazing hendrix record in its own right. its all good.    stand outs are hey baby, freedom, angel and others..    however i find myself skipping \\"my friends\\" a lot.. seems out of place. i would have loved for pali gap to have been there instead. i would die lol.
B002KQ6BT6|2.0|I'm a fan of Dan Brown, and have read all of his books.  I enjoyed the fast paced stories with very interesting twists, as well as a little history.  However, this book is missing many of the aspects that made his other novels enjoyable.  He repetitively made the characters look at something with \\"shock\\" and then cut to another scene.  The \\"twists\\" felt very forced, oddly timed, and not all that awe inspiring when explained.  In addition, the end became nothing but pages and pages of philosophical preaching about scripture, god, and man's interpretation, when all you really wanted was for it to end already.  Sorry Dan, but this one will make me very weary about buying one of the future novels.  Just didn't recapture the same exciting feel and flow that was melded so well togegther in his previous novels.  Overall.. a huge disappointment for me... even coming into this as a fan.
B001QXE0OC|3.0|Well, first off, selena gomez is an excellent actress. She is the star of the disney, tv show, wizards of waverly place; she has guest stared in the disney show, sonny with a chance once so far, and she has guest starred in hannah montana several times. Selena has also been in two movies, princess protection program and another cinderella story; selena is an amazing actress. But the songs on this cd to me just didnt seem to fit her except for several songs the others just need more rock and pop to them; so i hope when and if she has a Sopohore album there will be more rock and pop to the songs. But i do recommend buying this cd; bc it does have several good songs on it.
B001GCUO16|5.0|duh, loved it, being a big comic fan its hard not to.  it lived up to the quality of the other xmen flics. i actually had my 12yr old daughter save her money and told me thats what she wanted so i wanting it also didnt think twice, and amazon has the best pricing, and the amazon prime gives me free two day shipping, cant beat it
B0001GMIOE|5.0|Bought this because i bought the battery grip for my 40d and it requires 2 batteries to run isntead of one, but then it doubles the shooting time, hell, i can say it triples or quadruples it, haha.    Pricey, but worth every penny.
B0025KVLUQ|4.0|Got a chance to do a side by side with an earlier import version of the record. Remastered version is more open. Sound field stretches beyond the confines of the the speakers, instead of being suspended between. Sound is a bit peaky, as seems to b typical of most remasters these days. I'm not really sure why this is, but I leave that for bigger minds. Overall I give it a B+, compared to C for the import version.<br /><br />DJ
B000002P7R|2.0|the title track is ambitious but falls short.. a lot of the other tracks are already available elsewhere or i heard a lot in the live releases already, like tax free, message to love, Angel,lover man(rock me baby), power of soul.    all along the watchtower isnt much different to the recorded version. little wing is just Angel again.    the only one i thought was fun was pali gap.    can you rent cds? just hear it twice and return it but copy pali gap :).

0756656230|4.0|These are well-crafted books for Lego ethusiasts, and I'd recommend them. However, I did notice a few mistakes. The Aquazone series is listed as first appearing in 1995 and 1985. The 1985 is a typo that slipped by editors; 1995 is the correct year.  Also questionable is the mini-figure book's description of the Forestmen, part of the Castle series. It states they battled the Black Falcons. I'm not sure where the author got that information from, as the only set that the Black Falcon knights and the Forestmen share is a mini-figure pack. Based on other sets released, the Forestmen would better be described as being in conflict with the Crusader knights (also called \\"Lion Knights\\") more than anyone else, as evidenced by the sets called \\"Dungeon Hunters\\" (the Crusaders holding a forestman prisoner in a jail wagon) and \\"Forestmen's River Fortress\\" (the Forestmen holding a Crusader knight in their watery dungeon). The impression given is that the Forestmen were Robin Hood and his Merrymen opposing the rule of the Crusader/Lion Knights for whatever reason. This is reinforced by the later Dark Forest line of similar forest rogues and their enemies the Royal Knights (who also had a lion emblem). Most casual enthusiasts won't care about any of that nitpicking, but I thought it was worth noting.
B00005JKNF|5.0|I was on the fence about buying this film, luckily I jumped off onto the right side. I read some of the reviews and was worried that Gosford Park might be \\"boring,\\" \\"drawn-out,\\" \\"pointless,\\" or many of the other negative comments that people posted about it. However, NONE of those words apply. I was COMPLETELY ENGROSSED with this film and was very happy I bought it. The move is not about a murder, catching a killer, or any of the other aspects typical of a murder-mystery. Instead, its a fascinating look at the British social class in the early 30's. That may sound slightly boring, but it was far from it. Gosford is chalk full of humor, sexual tension, witty lines, and a twisting plot. Aside from that, the movie is BEAUTIFULLY shot. Watching it on my widescreen HD TV, I couldn't help but feel pulled into the gorgeous colors captured by the skillful and fluid movements of the camera. Overall, Gosford Park is an excellent film that I would recommend without hesitation. That said, this film might not be for you if you are looking for a short action packed flick or thrillingly mysterious movie. Gosford, instead, is a scenic and stunning look at Britain in the 1930's. FIVE STARS!!
B002EWD0I6|5.0|English country life could never have been as poetic, pictorial, and enchanting as this dramatization of the lives of those living in and around the two 1880's towns of Lark Rise and Candleford. Even the DVD's music puts a sanguine sugarcoating on the period. All of this is to the delight of the viewer of this masterfully done TV series sure to endear any North American who has a tender video heart toward Victorian Britain. Perhaps, consider it a British mutation of \\"Little House on the Prairie\\" or \\"The Waltons.\\"<br /><br />This set of 4 DVDs, 10 episodes totaling 582 minutes, is actually a 9 1/2+ hour saga (continuing panorama of human relationship) of the commoner village and the more sophisticated Candleford. The short 8-mile separation allows for much intermingling, bigotry, conflict, forbidden love, political and economic interaction. It is not a family saga, not a nobility bloodline dramatization, but a saga of struggles and lifestyles of different kinds of personalities, each caught in their own born-into world, and interacting with another different, and not always understood, class of folk.<br /><br />Darling Laura Timmins (Olivia Hallinan), oldest child of a Lark Rise family, is sent off to Candleford to learn the trade of postmistress. She is the spark caught between the two towns (sometimes world's different.) Her mentor, Dorcas (Julia Sawalha), has a personal secret. There is the expected, token-gentry, rich, Squire family, Sir Timothy (Ben Miles)& Lady Adelaide (Oliva Grant). The rest of the regular cast (at least 20 appearing in all 10 episodes) is an assortment of either the die-hard, disheveled, working class or the Candleford higher class, but yet short of nobility range. It is the individuals that make this spectacular (or fill in your own highest superlative.)<br /><br />One episode travels into the next with carryover from earlier material. If you have the time, it's best to watch it as a near 10-hour feature production. What a horrible time the original TV viewers must have had waiting for the next installment. Each episode has multiple plots so it is impossible to break down the episodes into short summaries. And with carryover from one episode to another, it's more like moving to Lark Rise or Candleford and living with the good people (and the bad). A delightful scenic experience even Disney has never matched.<br /><br />Ah, but the folks you will meet. Dr. Seuss eat your heart out. Queenie (Linda Bassett), an old bee keeper, is married to ole Twister (Karl Johnson) and both will make you laugh and cry, perhaps in the same scene. Pearl (Matilda Ziegler) and Ruby (Victoria Hamilton) own Pratt's General Drapers & Haberdashers. They represent the best of fashion and fitness, just ask them, as they spurn much gossip and controversy. Thomas (Mark Heap) is a postal delivery man who helps keep Christianity alive and aloud. Portly Caroline (Dawn French) a mother with her man off to sea, divides her time between frivolity and beer and would make a fine Viking helpmate. And dear, dear old housemaid Zillah (a standing O for Liz Smith), is the life and death of every party--a quirkiness totally lovable. Assistant gamekeeper Phillip and melodean-playing Alfie vie for Laura's affection, while her ma, Emma (Claudie Blakley), and pa, Robert (Brendan Coyle) try in vain to keep sanity to the comings and goings of life from \\"Lark Rise to Candleford.\\"<br /><br />Oh and more, locations and sets to die for a vacation in. Costumes to dazzle, delight, and disgust, depending upon the event. Every emotion you have ever felt in your past will be repeated sometime throughout this English town saga. The adapted books by Flora Thompson have never been read by this reviewer, but I can't imagine them being as fine as this TV series (and I'm a book lover). A superb British cast has perfected this story.<br /><br />Subtitles? Yes!<br />Bonus? \\"The Making of Lark Rise To Candleford\\"<br />Recommendation? BUY NOW! EXPEDITE SHIPPING, it's that good.
B001HN697M|2.0|To begin, let me state that I enjoyed the first two installments of the \\"Underworld\\" series. This movie however, is a complete waste of time, unless you want to see Bill Nighy chew scenery. Michael Sheen returns as Lucian (the head lycan from the first movie), and the amazing thing here is they actually made him look younger in this, the prequel. Aside from those things, however, the movie offers absolutely nothing new to the story that's already been laid down in the first two movies, a fact that culminates in one of the worst endings to a movie I've ever seen, structurally speaking. The rule of thumb for storytelling is, the ending should be inevitable but unexpected. Guess what? You saw the ending coming, from about 2 movies ago. Skip this one, unless you desperately need to see Michael Sheen with his shirt off, or have a mad-on for watching Bill Nighy gnaw own every scene he's in.
B001CJJWV6|5.0|i have the criterion dvd and this blu-ray isnt much different in the video department. audiowise they are both very sweet and hard to choose... but this version has the extra footage as a bonus special featute.. it was fun seeing the show again froma different viewpoint.<br /><br />the concert is edited slightly different and is mostly the same but i found it refreshing. also included is all the avialble footage of purple haze. can you see me is still missing.<br /><br />menus are very cool with jimis burning guitar. on criterion you have to switch between otis and hendrix and the menu looks like recycled tree paper. you also have to but the 3 disc version to get some monterey history.. this blu-ray has a small doc on monterey if your interested then you can get criterion version of that.
B001DJLCRC|4.0|Walter White is a man on the edge.  A former chemistry whiz, now he's an unappreciated high school teacher who moonlights as a car wash attendant.  When his doctor tells him he has terminal cancer, he decides it's time to rethink his life.  The path he chooses is unconventional and inadvisable and highly illegal, but it does break him free from his doldrums while creating all kids of problems for himself and his family.<br /><br />It's a wild ride, but the emotions ring true.  Walter has to deal with doctors, drug dealers, his DEA brother-in-law, a strung out former failed student and current partner, a worried wife and son, and struggles to stay alive in the face of danger while he slowly dies.  What grounds the story is the real emotional conflict of a man facing \\"mid-life crisis\\" on the brink of an impending death, and the issues this raises for him, his wife and his son.<br /><br />The performances are quite strong, especially that of Bryan Cranston, who immerses himself so thoroughly into the role of Walter White that it's hard to imagine him as anything else.  The story is engaging and unpredictable.  It looks great, and I like that they made the Albuquerque skies and deserts such an integral part of the look.  It's a strong series, that I hadn't even heard of until I tried it on this dvd set.  I'm glad I did.  While series like [[ASIN:B001C3O6R2 The Sopranos]] and [[ASIN:B002APNJCE Dexter]] inject real life into the over-the-top stereotypical screen portrayals of gangsters and serial killers, you could say that Breaking Bad injects a bit of the extremity of drug crime tv and film portrayals into what is really a family drama.  Breaking Bad is very good television.
1423113497|5.0|These stories are excellent for a young person. There is just the right amount of fantasy mixed in with current times, which keeps the stories interesting.
0439023483|4.0|This book was recommended to me by a professor for an assignment to read a young adult novel.  Described to me as \\"Imagine Survivor where they have to kill each other.\\" I had gone in with expectations of violence, betrayal and suspense, and The Hunger Games certainly delivers.  The story of Katniss Everdeen is packed full of twists and turns, sorrow and joy.  She provides a glimpse into a post-apocalyptic North America where the Capitol rules over the districts that make up Panem.  Through a turn of unfortunate events, Katniss is forced into a life or death situation where she must use her wits to survive a harsh game where all odds seem against her.  Through out these trials Katniss struggles to find what is important in life, and what is worth dying, and living for.      Suzanne Collins did a wonderful job of creating an interesting story that is easy to read.  Skillfully twisting suspense, romance and action to create a story that seemed to come to life from the pages, this is a great story to get a teenager reading.  The end of the book will have you wanting the sequel in your possession immediately.

031606792X|1.0|If you haven't read my previous Twilight series reviews, it may benefit you to read them so you know where I stand with this series.<br /><br />As with all of the other Twilight books, I didn't enjoy this one. However, this fourth and final installment in the Twilight series was definitely the most interesting. In this book, Bella officially joins the Cullen family. This book is definitely aimed towards an older audience than before. Sex scenes and allusions to sex occur in various parts of the book. From the beginning, it was obvious that this book would be even weirder than the rest. I don't want to give anything away, but suffice it to say unnatural surprises and the formation of bizarre relationships were the groundwork of the final novel in the series.<br /><br />The book had a painfully slow start, and for the first 138 pages I had to fight off immense boredom and force myself to read through. Most thankfully, the book is then interjected with a section told from the perspective of Jacob. In a series of books where you are constantly stuck listening to the insane blathering of Bella's mind, Jacob's rational thought processes offer a refreshing reprieve.<br /><br />Had this book been written by any other author, I feel that it would have been relatively enjoyable. Unfortunately, we are stuck with Stephanie Meyer, who possesses the writing skills of a fourteen year old girl. Stephanie Meyer's books would be about 10 pages long if she didn't repeat herself as much as she does. As I said in my review of The Host, there is something in her writing style that reminds me of students who write term papers and add adjectives and repeat themselves a dozen times in an effort to make their papers longer. I could sum up her entire series, not just a single book, in less than a paragraph:<br /><br />Bella loves Edward. Edward loves Bella. Jacob loves Bella. Bella loves Jacob. Vampires are beautiful. Bella can't live without Edward. Bella has a near death experience in every book.<br /><br />I mean, seriously... in this book, when Bella becomes a vamp, Meyer goes on for pages upon pages about how Bella's senses are heightened and the Cullens are even more beautiful than ever. She then goes into describing just how beautiful each individual Cullen is with her new vampire eyes. Would it not suffice to just say something to the effect of, \\"If it were possible, the Cullens were even more beautiful with my new vision than they were when I was a human.\\"? Perhaps not that cheesy, but just about anything else would work! How many times does Bella have to tell us she's freakishly strong, or that she has incredible self control before Meyer trusts that we've got the point? The answer: the entire book. To the end, she continues to repeat such details.<br /><br />As if repeating herself a hundred times weren't enough, Meyer turned to redundancy in this book! Not only can you learn every five pages that Edward is beautiful, but you also get to experience statements such as this one<br /><br />\\"I'm laughing because I am in shock. And I am in shock because I am completely amazed.\\"<br /><br />Let's pull a thesaurus on this one<br /><br />Main Entry: shocked<br />Part of Speech: adjective<br />Definition: startled<br />Synonyms: aghast, amazed, appalled, astonished, astounded, dismayed, offended, stunned, upset<br /><br />At one point in the book, Meyer tries to subtly provide an excuse to mention the index at the end of the book so the reader can follow who is who. Many books have means for the reader to follow along, so I'm not knocking the index. My issue is with her feeling the need to add a line in the book. Why not provide the index at the beginning, as most books do? The addition of the line \\"[Jacob] grumbled to Renesmee that someone was going to have to provide an index if anyone expected him to keep all the new bloodsuckers' names straight.* (The * leading to a footnote regarding the page you could find the index on)\\" The line almost seems like an afterthought, as though she decided to randomly drop in a paragraph about Jake as an excuse to mention the index (or perhaps an editor commented that it was too confusing).<br /><br />The end of the book was relatively exciting, but couldn't make up for the slow start or poor writing. As with every other book in the series, danger is always averted and the \\"Happily Ever After\\" ending was painfully predictable. I am happy things worked out for Jacob, who was in my opinion one of the only tolerable characters in the series. In the end, the reading was not enjoyable enough for this book to be considered a \\"good read\\" in my honest opinion. I was hoping the series would pull it out in the end, but alas, it was a dud!cuse to mention the index (or perhaps an editor commented that it was too confusing).

I didn't want to spend what they were asking for there so I ordered a used one and really wanted the outside of the book to look like her diary that she wrote in /red plaid.  I was so dissappointed when I recieved my book and it looked nothing like the picture.  Yes it is the same book but I thought I was getting the one that pictured so I was very dissapointed.
0385342020|5.0|From the cover flap:  \\"Lara Lington has always had an overactive imagination, but suddenly that imagination seems to be in overdrive.  Normal professional twenty-something young women don't get visited by ghosts.  Or do they?\\"<br /><br />From the author of the Shopaholic series, we now meet Sophie Kinsella's most delightful character yet.  Lara Lington has all the normal aspects of one of Kinsella's characters. She is flawed, she tends to lie to her parents (especially about her career and love life), but she is truly well-intentioned, down to the core.<br /><br />When her great-aunt Sadie dies at the age of 105, Lara feels only mildly distressed.  After all, she didn't really know her.  She does feel a pang of guilt about that, though.<br /><br />When she is suddenly \\"visited\\" by the presence of her Great-Aunt Sadie, Lara doesn't believe it--at least, not at first.  We then follow Lara and Sadie in a rollicking adventure in their quest for a \\"dragonfly\\" necklace that was Sadie's during her heyday in 1920s London.<br /><br />Their adventures take them through various locales and even to a fashion show starring Lara's cousin Diamante, the daughter of her rather famous Uncle Bill, the family success story.<br /><br />Along the way, Sadie meddles in Lara's life, even \\"shouting\\" in the ears of her lovers, until Lara feels like a puppet manipulated by the puppeteer.<br /><br />But when the quest leads them down a mysterious pathway and the uncovering of a guilty secret, Lara's life will never be the same again.<br /><br />An absolutely delightful story that shines with Kinsella's charming twist, [[ASIN:0385342020 Twenties Girl: A Novel]] is a winner, in which a five star rating is too few, in my opinion.
B001DXATM2|5.0|First of all, I want to make it clear that I am reviewing Hvis Lyset Tar Oss.  For some reason, the reviews for Daudi Baldrs appear instead of reviews for Hvis Lyset Tar Oss.    Varg Vikernes said in an interview awhile back that he considers this album his best.  As much as I like Filosofem, I may have to agree with him.  Hvis Lyset Tar Oss contains four longer pieces of music, all of them strong, three buzzing metal pieces and one dark ambient.  In my opinion, the strongest works are the longest: the opener \\"Det Som En Gang Var,\\" and the ambient closer, \\"Tomhet.\\"  Both of these tracks clock in at just over fourteen minutes each.  This is powerful stuff: aggressive, mesmerizing, disturbing, uplifting.  Burzum is my favorite metal band (albeit a one-man band), and Hvis Lyset Tar Oss is one of the finest reasons why.
B001RTP3Z0|5.0|Had no idea when I turned it on what to expect. Knew maybe 3 of his songs. I was blown away. The, song writing, phrasing, musicianship of his musicians and the absolutely incredible backup singers juxtapositioned with his voice was amazing. I've seen and loved everyone from Hendrix to Springsteen, Cream, and on and on and this is right up there with the best. Play it through a good sound system. B
B000AYEL6U|5.0|Plot Details: This opinion reveals minor details about the movie''s plot.<br />If you're a fan of Pride and Prejudice, I highly recommend you check out North & South!!! Netflix kept recommending it to me because of my tendencies towards BBC romances. I've always been a die hard Jane Austen fan.<br /><br />Originally I was a bit confused, because I'm familiar with North and South, the American Civil War miniseries. I couldn't figure out why Netflix kept saying I should try North & South because of my previous interest in movies like Sense and Sensibility and Pride and Prejudice. I never read the synopsis for movies, because I hate ruining the plot. I added it to my watch instantly queue and gave it a go.<br /><br />Needless to say, I was pleasantly surprised! North & South consists of 4 \\"episodes\\" which tell the tale of Margaret Hale (played by Daniela Denby-Ashe) and John Thornton (played by the spectacular and oh-so-gorgeous Richard Armitage). After being uprooted from her home, Margaret and her family settle down up north in Milton, an industrial city known for its production of cotton. Margaret meets Mr. Thornton, a tough cotton mill owner, under less that desirable circumstances and takes an immediate dislike to the man.<br /><br />The story from there follows Margaret's efforts to feel at home in a foreign and unhappy place. She misses her life in the south, her home which she often called 'paradise' and London, where she spent so much time with her beloved cousin and friends. You watch as she gains new friends, learns about herself and the realities of life, and undergoes great joys and tragedies.<br /><br />If you love romantic movies and BBC, you have to check out North & South! Not to sound obsessive, but I bought the movie the same day I saw it on Netflix watch instantly, and have watched it at least a hundred times since! I know the movie by heart, and even made an epic search of tracking down the soundtrack (which was never released). I can watch it again and again! I've even bought the book the movie is based on, which I plan to read very soon!!!ok the movie is based on, which I plan to read very soon!!!
B000M343BM|5.0|The team owner wants to bring in ball playrs from all around the league as well as starting with a new staff of coaches tries to bring her team in last place.  With the support of the coaches and vetern players the team started to gel quicker than expected.  There are lots of laughs throughout the game. The announcer for the game keeps the laughs coming over and over. This movie is really a great for the sports fan in you.
0671027573|3.0|Read this if you enjoy comedy, dialogue, and suspense.  But, I was a bit disappointed in the romance part.  This was my first Linda Howard book.  It won't be my last, but I was somewhat disappointed.<br /><br />The dialogue was uproarious, and they characters were appealing (Sam was hot hot hot).  The plot was attention-grabbing too.  However, I felt like the book was a weee bit too long for what it was offering.  Additionally, I was kind of let down in the romance department.  I like my romance novels to have more *romance* and the scenes to be a little bit, er, steamier...especially with such great characters.<br /><br />But, all in all, an easy read.  Took me about 5 hours, so the satisfaction I got in reading this book was well worth the investment in time.
B0025KVLUQ|4.0|This release was originally mastered in stereo.  As a result, the difference might not be that noticable for the average listener on this cd.  Still a recommended buy. It's the Beatles.

B001GCUO1Q|5.0|Plot Details: This opinion reveals minor details about the movie''s plot.<br />It's always been my opinion that you can really tell the quality of a movie just by the previews. Awful theatrical trailers that make you look at your friends like, \\"Seriously?\\" generally indicate a bad movie ahead. This movie was preceded by trailers for movies like Transformers, Night at the Museum, and Ice Age. The whole audience was revved up just by the previews.<br /><br />The movie had me from the start... it had a brilliant intro. Who knew Wolverine was so interesting?! It starts with Wolverine and Sabertooth as kids, Jimmy and Victor (respectively). After an incident with their fathers, and discovering they're brothers, they run off and stick together throughout all sorts of amazing experiences. Surviving numerous wars, they are eventually recruited by Col. William Stryker, who has put together an elite team of mutants. Wolverine ends up deciding he'd rather have a life of peace and finds himself a woman. Things start getting nasty when Sabertooth and Stryker team up to gather mutants' abilities in an effort to create a super weapon.<br /><br />I thought it was awesome how they brought in so many characters to tell the story of Logan as he became Wolverine... We see early Scott (Cyclops), Young Prof. Xavier, etc. As soon as Scott heard \\"Go Left\\" I knew Xavier was close! The new characters were great too! Gambit was downright intense, and Deadpool was amazing with a sword (I couldn't even recognize Ryan Reynolds at the end of the movie).<br /><br />That movie was an intense, action packed movie! I will most definitely buy it the day it hits DVD. It's one of the few movies in a long time that I feel has been worth the $10 to see in movie theatres. The only problem I have with the whole series now is that I loved Liev Schrieber as Sabertooth. I now have trouble watching X-1 because they have that furry growling guy as Sabertooth, and not smart-mouthed Victor who relished picking on his little brother.
1591841992|3.0|Good if you are new to the subject, but old hat for the rest of us.<br /><br />I really wanted to like this but, but I feel like it's only good for people who have never considered visual thinking.  I felt like I already knew everything in the book.  Parts were very boring.  He categorizes the process, but many of us have already done that for ourselves throughout the years.<br /><br />Not horrible; a fun book to have sitting around for others to read.
B0025KVLT2|3.0|The remastered stereo effect doesn't work on the these cd's originally mastered in mono. That is how they intended for them to be heard.The vocals simply sound out of place.
0786868724|5.0|I have just finished reading this work of art, and I must say that it will be one of those books that I know I will re-read in the years to come.<br /><br />From when we first meet the people within the story who will guide us through the journey that the book will take us on to the last page.  There were many passages that I found within the book that I wanted to really remmember, there are parts of that book that have my own notes.<br /><br />I would highly recomend this book.  If this is your first read by Mitch Albom, to a returning reader, this is one o those works of literature that will stay with you.
0439023491|5.0|You need to go into this one without reading any spoilers, so I'm not going to summarize it at all.  I didn't think the author could top The Hunger Games, but boy was I wrong!  This book blew me out of the water!  I think I can easily say that this is the best book I've read so far this year.  I absolutely cannot wait for the next one.  Oh, and when I wasn't reading, I was singing Revolution by The Beatles.  Couldn't help it...
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|Netflix has been suggesting for a while that I need to check out Dexter. I finally broke down because I've been hearing from friends how addictive the show is. Within a couple of episodes, I was hooked! It's so interesting, seeing into the head of a sociopath! He's a serial killer, but only kills bad people... murderers, rapists, etc. I love when he starts going on about his inability to form relationships with other people. And every so often you get a flashback to his childhood, which is really great for insight about his personality and why he does what he does.
0385341075|5.0|This is a great novel.  My entire book club loved it.  But it helps to have read Great Expectations first.

B002KDUDG6|5.0|This is my first Michael Buble CD. I have nothing to compare it to but I think it's an excellent CD.<br /><br />Michael's covers on the classics such as \\"All of Me\\" and \\"At This Moment\\" are fantastic!<br /><br />His new song, Havne't Met You Yet, is a really catch tune. I love the video too.<br /><br />Overall I'm very pleased. He has a new fan in me.
0375826726|5.0|This book follows the battle on the Burning Plains. Eragon's loyalties are pulled in multiple directions and he has to make decisions on which promises to fulfill. Roran needs help saving Katrina from the Ra'zac, the Varden need his help in the battlefield, and the elves and dwarves are also fighting battles throughout Alagaesia and need his help.<br /><br />In this book, you encounter many new situations. Eragon goes on a journey to help Roran, while the Varden deal with unrest and low morale in the army. Eragon also makes a trip to Tronjheim to sit in on the election of a new dwarf king. This book carries Eragon all over Alagaesia. My favorite part is when you finally learn the meaning of Solembum's prophecy regarding the Menoa Tree.<br /><br />This book actually made me cry at parts! The writing is absolutely fantastic. Each book in the Inheritance Cycle is better than the last! It is obvious that Christopher Paolini has grown as a writer since the first book. When I read Chris Paolini's books, I can't put them down! The depth of detail and his writing style provide a vivid mental image. I can read his books and it's like watching a movie in my head. I hope he finishes that fourth book soon. It's as bad as it used to be to wait for the next Harry Potter book!<br /><br />This book left many loose ends to tie up in the final book. There are still a couple of parts so Solembum's prophecy that haven't been fulfilled (such as Eragon leaving Alagaesia forever), so I look forward to the end of the series!
B002LVVCIK|5.0|Once upon a time people were \\"taught\\" to think the King spoke for GOD and that was that. Today we are \\"taught\\" Capitalism is the \\"natural order of things\\" and \\"works better than any other system\\". Both arguments  were used to uphold the divine right of Kings. Some things never change. People want leaders. Why,is beyond me. Even the Old Testament tells Israel you may have your King but it will not make you happy.Great movie, Mike. Your best yet. Problem is, people do not have a vision of how to live in a world without \\"Leaders\\". Without a vision of non-hierarchical power structures people are clueless to what replaces them. Democracy was started into play in America,in a small way--but became still born by the 1840's. Since then it has just been a tool of power for the wealthy to steal from the poor.I really wish Michael Moore had stayed with and backed Ralph Nader. President Obama is going to break his heart.You told a great story, Mr.Moore. A true story. If you make a wonderful romantic comedy in which everyone turns out HAPPY! HAPPY! HAPPY!!! in the end with great wealth due to the wonders of Freedom and the Free Market you would make a ton of money.  I bet the folks that ran the Colosseum in Rome made a ton of money also. Thanks for the effort. In your \\"Love Story\\" you told the truth. People want the pretty lie. I loved how you re-cased Jesus as Milton Friedman,genius. Give my love to the good Fathers in your film. I really mean that. I have lived so long that the Roman Catholic Church has become less hierarchical than my government.More just also. Will go back and see the movie again and buy the DVD as soon as possible. Hope we meet in the streets someday. Now that would be change!!!!

0440246008|3.0|My first Lee Child book and I must admit it grabbed me and pulled me all the way to the end in one sitting. Some good surprises, and some predictability. I suppose I can't fault a thriller with mercenaries for being violent, but it was too violent for me. All the horrible things that bad men can do to men, women, and children -- they're described graphically, if briefly, at some point during the story. I was excited to start out reading, but by the end I just felt ill. If you want to escape harsh reality, this is indeed the hard way.
B0000CABBW|5.0|I had seen this movie on TV and loved it and wanted to add this DVD to my collection.  The movie introduced me to a culture and country I knew very little about.  The acting is superb.  A wonderful change from some of the crap we see in movies these days.
1580084621|5.0|This book is from one of the great Thai food chefs in Australia and provides not only a large array of recipes, but also an education about the culture behind the food and the way the ingredients have come into use by the Thai people.

0385504225|4.0|I always love Dan Brown's work.  His short (and numerous) chapters make for ab easy read and make it hard to put down.  I liked Lost Symbol and would recommend it.  However, I thought the beginning was better than the middle which was much better than the ending.  Angels and Demions is still my favorite Dan Brown novel.  I think this laters work is written too much in anticipation of a movie deal.  Read it and judge for yourself.[[ASIN:0385504225 The Lost Symbol]]

B001GCUO1Q|5.0|And that \\"Bryan Singers\\" vision just wasn't that great.   At first, the idea of a spin-off origin story of Wolverine sounded stupid. Why did we need to hear more about Wolverine then we did in X2. Wasn't killing Stryker and learning of those origins enough?  No, it definitely wasn't. There was much to learn about Wolverine's very long past, and I say long because somehow they get a hell of a lot of material done in a 1 hour and 47 minutes. From the awesome credits scenes with him and Sabertooth (needed an origin story as well)in various wars, it becomes obvious that a great movie has been made.  From the introduction of Deadpool (gets the coolest scenes in the movie) the death of a love of Wolverine's, to his involvement in the \\"Weapon X\\" program, the movie moves from one to thing to another very smoothly.  From great action scenes (Wolverine being shot at on a motorcyle after being admanatium is in him being the best) and some really sad moments when various characters are killed, I completly forgot why I ever cared about \\"Bryan's Singer\\" ovveratted vision.  I would rate this either the best or 2nd best X-Men movie, only possibly 2nd to X3. I know what most people of think of X3, so an explanation is needed for this belief.  X-Men was a good movie, but it was obvious that the budget wasn't high enough and just didn't allow for enough explosive action in a franchise that is half about the awesome powers in fight scenes. X-Men 2 got that budget and while having a great story wasted money on a dragged on ending scene (breaking facility=boring) and a lack of anything for Colossus to do. X-Men: The Last Stand (X3) was not dragged on in any way, and while it did insert way too many characters (wasted Colossus and side characters as well), gave Storm more screen time (give her a spin-off for god sakes) and fufilled a excellent storyline involving the pheonix.   Yes, Deadpool was a little off in Wolverine. But it was meant to be his origin story as well, wasn't it? Yes. Iimagine his spin-off will show us the true Deadpool. And yes Gambit was randomly inserted to please no one. But other characters like Silver Fox, The Blob, and the guy Will.I.AM played (forgot his name) were handled perfectly, which is less than I say for the limited screen time of Storm in any X-Men movie.  The next time around, I would like to see no random characters that sacrifice story being inserted. But the action must be kept up and the story must as well. If this is done, the next X-Men movie, whether it be Deadpool, X-Men; First Class, Magneto, or Wolverine 2, could easily be the best.    Oh, and if X4 is ever made, I want to see Angel as a main character doing a lot of flying around, Roque realizing her true powers, Professor X-s new body, and Apocalypse causing humans and mutants to team up to fight him.
B000002MIF|5.0|About other Smiths albums and compilations vis-a-vis this one:  Yeah, I've heard the hype about how great and minimal and raw and rock-and-roll-authentic Louder Than Bombs is, and I know that most consider The Queen is Dead to be the greatest thing since sliced bread, Vegemite, or SPAM, and I'm sorry some of you didn't GET Meat Is Murder, but IMHO the single >>BEST&lt;&lt; Smiths collection and possibly third-best album (NOT including The Queen Is Dead but rather Strangeways) is THIS.<br /><br />For a compilation and/or teaser/introduction I think this better than Louder Than Bomb.  The 1st album, the eponymous \\"The Smiths\\" was plenty real and raw ENOUGH for a great studio album;  Meat Is Murder is a great one and still a favorite of mine;  and I am VERY fond of both of the UK single releases that got tacked on the albums in The States that are included here: This Charming Man and How Soon Is Now? the latter of which I think is a SEMINAL, DEFINING piece of 80s avant-garde/DOR (Dance-Oriented-Rock--remember that term?) classic.  So this between-albums collection is my pick over LTB.  On this compilation you get both those singles originally released only in the UK, plus all the other (what is it, NINE or 8?) singles of the period of the first two albums, plus, it's not an \\"I-hate-under-cooked-and-RAW-meat-but-just-LOVE-under-cooked(under-produced)-and-raw-unproduced-MUSIC\\" piece of Peel Session demos like Louder Than Bombs.<br /><br />Forget about all the newer compilations, B-side thingies, and sucker-fan releases that only yield you ONE or TWO or maybe even ZERO new tracks.  Check this out, and ignore the angry mobs of Vegan Morrissey-worshipping, buy-EVERYTHING completists.<br /><br />For balance, if I WERE MORE NUTS about this band, as I am about some others, I WOULD be buying EVERYTHING, even just for 1 or 2 tracks, so save your hate, girls.  It's not charming or cute to be hyper-emo and verbally-defensive after puberty.<br /><br />Kidding!!!  ;-)

B002KDUDG6|4.0|Michael is the best male voice of our time!!  And he's very musical in addition to having such a great tone quality to his voice.  Most of the tracks on this CD are superb.  \\"Cry Me a River\\" is a totally unexpected and powerful arrangement.  It's a bit overwhelming (especially the intro which reminds me of Phantom of the Opera), but it grows on you.  \\"Heartache Tonight\\" gets way too loud for me and isn't the type of song I wanted to hear at all on this CD. \\"Whatever it Takes\\" represents Michael at his very best indeed!  This CD proves that you can't please everyone.  Since I love Michael, I had to get it.  I'll just skip the 2 selections that I don't feel should have been included:  Heartache Tonight and Baby, You've Got What it Takes.
B0021L9MJG|2.0|First of all, let me explain that the TWO-STAR rating I've given this, the Blu-Ray DVD version of Creepshow, is only for the DVD itself.  The movie, which is one of my all-time favorite horror flicks is definately a FIVE-STAR piece of movie-making!    This Blu-Ray disc, as others have found, is a great disappointment. The video transfer is fair at best.  I did an A/B comparision between this disc and the regular DVD on two Blu-Ray players with an HD 32\\" television and I see very little difference.    But what's worse, the only extra is the trailer. Now here's the real injustice to Creepshow fans:  There is an excellent 2 Disc DVD Special Edition available from the United Kingdom. The first Disc contains the full-length film. But unlike the American DVD release, there's an audio commentary throughout the feature with George Romero and master make-up artist Tom Savini. And in addition to the 2.0 stereo sound, there's also a 5.1 surround soundtrack! The second disc is filled with a multitude of extras! First, there's a 90 minute feature \\"Just Desserts--The Making of Creepshow.\\" It's loaded with interviews with George Romero, Tom Savini, and many other cast and crew  members.  Also included are deleted scenes, alternate takes and bloopers. Next, there's behind-the-scenes footage personally filmed by Tom Savini. Finally, there's a stills gallery and of course the trailer.      The entire package comes in a clear standard keep case which is contained in an outer cardboard slipcase! Now, if you didn't already realize, here's the bad news:  Since this is a European release, it is in the PAL television format, Region 2.  It is also very unlikely that any of these extras will ever be available here in the U.S. because Universal Home Video owns the rights to everything in the U.K. not Warner Brothers; actually the 90 minute featurette appears to have been assembled by Universal and is introduced as Universal Presents...  I doubt Warner Brothers will ever strike up a deal withUniversal to bring these features to us fans in America; they missed their chance for this Blu-Ray release.    If you have a region code free DVD player and a PAL to NTSC television converter, go to Amazon.uk and order this package. It's well worth it!!

B0015ABRE2|3.0|Given the caveat of the whole \\"Dexter\\" life story being absurdly unbelievable, it was still easy to hunker down and, once again, watch Michael Hall play his wonderfully nuanced character.  For me, the first two seasons hung just barely around a 4-star rating. Hall is fantastic, but one person doesn't constitute a series. Sorry to see a star dribble away throughout Season 3.  Though bolstered by an ingenious role for Jimmy Smits (as DA Miguel Prado) and complemented by the always engrossing David Zayas (Det. Angel Batista), it all was so very beige.      Maybe it's the ADHD kicking in, but the scarce plot threads seem so slim and one-dimensional, the lives of the characters as plain as a family sitcom.  The intrigues have not so much depth to begin with -- they then go on throughout episodes until ending in more of a fadeout than a bang.        My big hope was for Dexter to do away with clingy lackluster Rita.  That not only would have made for a great episode, but would open the door for someone to be written into the show who had maybe something a little raw or edgy or brainy.  Well, that's not the way wind blew.      No big hopes left for Season 4.  It would be nice if it doesn't end up some serial-killer-flavored redux of \\"Little House on the Prairie\\".
B00009W0U4|5.0|This film is one of the most explicit movies I've ever seen. It is a great movie, but I wouldn't recomend it to the soft hearted. My wife had cried in disgust during a rape seen. Enough said. Great movie, not for kids.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|My 15 year old son had mentioned Planet Earth several times. He's into video games, sports, girls, etc. so it was very surprising when he put it on his birthday wish list.  Since it was educational, we definitely wanted him to have it.  Everyone in the family has enjoyed it; the scenaries are just beautiful!!!  It really a great way to witness the creations of God's hand that most of us would never know anything about.  Great for family-time.

B001I8BN7C|4.0|From a dark and mysterious forest along a well known trail, Stephen King presents us with another gem. The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon is a compelling horror novel about courage, perserverence, and doing anything to survive. The book follows the journey of young Trisha, who is \\"nine, but big for her age\\", on a terrifying trek in an attempt to get home. When bickering and anger drive her away from her family on a nature walk, she disappears in the forest. As she gets farther from the trail, her life begins to hang in the balance.<br />  King does a beautiful job in tell the story. With vivid descriptions of the environment and objects, you'll start to feel as though you are lost along side Trisha. King also does a wonderful job at melding comedy into the dark tale. I found myself chuckling at some parts, but i also found myself worrying about Trisha as if she was my own little sister. From early on she will touch your heart and establish a mental connection with you. This can make some parts of the story very tough to read due to the attachment you will start to feel. Some of the things she has to overcome are gizzly, while some just cause you to read on in awe.<br />  Overall this is a very compelling book and worth a read if you are looking for a horror/ adventure story. You wont want to stop reading about this brave girls journey.
B001EAWMGA|5.0|I teach 12th grade English and we start the semester with Beowulf.  We talk about the fantasy aspects of this epic poem and look at how the story may have changed from the oral tradition to the written word.  Then I show them Outlander. From a 21st century student's perspective many find the story to be quite believable.  This film is great from the storyline to the acting. James Caviezel and Sophia Miles add a dimension of humanity to this very ancient story.
B002I9Z89Y|4.0|Picture quality is great, EXCEPT the opening scene of Friday's Child (disk 3, episode 11) appears to be not cleaned up--washed out color, lots of grain.  After the opening titles, the rest of the episode looks clean and up to par (so far--I'm watching it now).  Somebody screwed up in QC during disc production.  But don't let that dissuade you; it looks great otherwise.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|Let me be succinct, this is a must see show. It is well written, acted, and executed. It shows how things are supposed to be, mixed with how they are. It makes politics, and Washington D.C. interesting and relatable. Watch it, because it is truly worth the time.

B0010YPTGU|5.0|2007 ? How did I miss this until tonight?  And I still didn't get to see the entire concert.  I have ordered it from PBS, for much more than the retail value, because I know that I need PBS to be available to all of us.    I have followed Bocelli for many years, and have tremendous respect for his talent.     However, watching the Tuscany 2007 concert tonight, I was reminded of Pavarotti, and sadly Bocelli just isn't there yet.  He may be in 10 or 20 years.      This is likely trite as heck, but the one totally original song was the one with Laura Pausini, \\"Dare to Live\\".    I have heard \\"The Prayer\\" a thousand times, and it still brings chills.  Heather Headly was excellent in this concert.

B001U0HBPQ|5.0|Prior to seeing this movie, I had read the short story which I thoroughly enjoyed.  That said, I was pleased and equally moved by the depth that the screen writer had given the story.     The movie covered so many things...    - rejection of those who are different  - unconditional love of mother for her child  - life and death  - living life to the fullest no matter your age  - falling in love   - etc......  So much was covered in this movie through the eyes of this simple man who was physically aging backwards...    Anyway, it is a movie that leaves one thinking about life even when laughing at some of the humorous moments interspersed throughout....    So, highly recommend this movie and what is great about getting the two disc edition is that the second disc shows you the process or birth of this film and unravels some of its technical mysteries....
B00288KNL8|5.0|This DVD contains a lovely animated film which would appeal to young and old alike.  In addition, it is in 3D as well as a normal version.  The 3D works well on home digital TV particularly if you sit quite close to the screen.  The DVD comes with 4 pairs of 3D glasses so all the kids can be amused at once!  The film is a bit scary at times so very sensitive young children might need an adult with them.

0783235380|5.0|This is a great movie and has a lot of laughs. Sandra Bullock and Ben Affleck have perfect chemistry. One of my favorites!
7884064790|3.0|I am a great fan of Kurosawa however, in this box set the sub-titles are almost un-intelligible. They are very bad English and rather spoil the marvellous films, one film The Quiet Duel does not even have English sub-titles.
B0002KPIQY|5.0|This is a relationship story in the beginning.  This is a fall-from-grace Tragedy at the end.  It is a voyeur film in the sense that the thrill is in the watching much more than in following along as the story unfolds, especially once the transition from the early relationship to the long, long fall begins.  The more successful the model becomes the more she is manipulated and the more she succumbs to the destructive extravagance available to her.
0385504225|1.0|This book is a real waste of time. A lot of rambling and stupidity. In most of the places it sounds like the paragraphs were cut out of some other book. No relvance to the story line. Bad ending is nothing new to Dan Brown. At the end, this book has nothing. It feels empty.
B0000UJDLM|5.0|Short Circuit is in many ways superior to Short Circuit II.  Short Circuit II is still an excellent story.  What we have here is the perennial (new movie every year with the same theme) affirmation of the sanctity of life movie.  These two movies feature the coming of age for the robot Johnny-Five.  The first movie deals with his awakening and struggle for a place in the human-society where he finds himself.  He must battle the forces deployed by his creator-corporation to return him to the spare parts bin.  It's a nail-biter.  In the second feature he plays out a parody of Pinochio's Troubled Years as he labors in an abandoned warehouse to help \\"Ben\\" by day even as the bad-guys are trying to corrupt him to steal a fortune in diamonds by night.  A robot never really sleeps.  There are numerous corruptions for the young would-be citizen Johnny-Five to struggle with.  As we cut to the chase again there is a flight-to-the-death struggle as Johnny-Five hangs by a thread (a crane-cable) losing power to the strains of \\"Where have all the good men gone ? ... I need a Hero !\\" ... Can help arrive in time ?  Will family, friends and health-care professionals step up to save the day ?  How ?  Check it out and see !

B00005NTN5|5.0|This is not so much a love story as a relationship story.  It is not a terribly strong relationship story.  If anything it is about taking a chance on the strength of a relationship and keeping commitments with potentially lost causes ... things work out this time if you can buy into the situation out in front.  It is a pure fantasy to start off with.  I can imagine calling it \\"Cinderella and the Princess\\" but the obvious Cinderella doesn't have any sisters that we know of and the Princess is low man on her totem-pole, for sure.  Together, not really trusting each other, they commit to each other \\"anyway\\" and, when everything falls apart in the middle of the caper they hang tight and battle individually through to their eventual reunion. There is suspense.  Once things get moving it is one change after another in rapid-fire succession until the very end.  About half-way through you think it is almost over and then everything starts falling apart.  It goes on and on and on.  There is violence.  It is sudden violence.  Torture is depicted.  There is lots of blood.  There is not so much skin but there is a lot of female sexuality expressed.  This is a story about sex and a couple of very tough chicks \\"walking tall\\".
B000UTZ510|4.0|Hauntingly beautiful music. Heartfelt lyrics and a little whimsy just for laughs. \\"Once\\" is not enough. You'll play it over and over. I recommend watching the film first.
B0000214F0|5.0|This is not the film that I saw in the main line cinema in Cleveland with my wife and some friends when I was young.  There is much more to this DVD than was available to the general public in the theater at that time.  It is much longer now.  There is wall to wall skin and panoramic sexual-depravity in the background.  It has some historical significance in that it attempts to cover the three years of Roman Emperor Caligula's rule.  The story of Caligula is the artistic excuse for the content of the film.  It is not the sort of thing you would see in an XXX-rated feature from the porno-industry because everything slides by pretty quick in the background behind the drama of the power-struggle as it unfolds.  One should not think, however, that one could just skip over the raunchy parts.  If you do not want your sensibilities to be challenged, don't load it into your machine.  Otherwise it is excellent !  It is a story of murder, incest, infidelity, loyalty and betrayal and then it starts all over again.  Around and around it goes until everybody has had more than enough.  It ends much the same way that it started.  Choose your friends carefully.  Forget the popcorn.
0385504225|3.0|As many of these reviews are lengthy, I'll be a bit more brief.  The Lost Symbol takes place over a short period in Washington D.C., features the main character from Da Vinci Code and pertains primarily to the Masons (symbology, beliefs, etc.)  The book is not well written.  It reads a bit like an early draft, not in the sense of having typos or grammatical mistakes, but rather in the weaving of historical, background information with plot movement.  A typical chapter, even late in the book when the action is heating up, might start with a dry paragraph that looks like an excerpt from an encyclopedia and then cut to an escape scene. e.g. (paraphrasing) \\"The [blank] temple is a 100 foot high classical greek structure modeled after the Parthenon and was built in 1842.  Robert frantically dashed across the lawn dodging the search lights.\\"  The shifts between background facts and plot are that stark and unpolished.  In the middle of what would be dramatic or intense moments, a character will often mentally drift into a neutral and lengthy recollection of his or her study of a particular aspect of Masonic lore.  It's like Brown wanted to write a nonfiction book, but wasn't allowed to by his publishers so he hastily draped a story over the book he really wanted to write.    I am quick to toss a book that doesn't hold my interest and I was generally entertained by this book.  Brown literally crammed it with provocative facts.  But at the same time, I was constantly pulled out of suspension of disbelief to remark to myself how clumsily fact and fiction were woven.
B00000IREA|5.0|Do you remember \\"The Summer of Love\\" ?  Do you remember \\"The Dawning of the Age of Aquarius (Where Peace will rule the planets and Love will steer the stars ... ) ?  Well, this is the standard for the vision portrayed as Barbarella treks to far off galaxies on a quest to apprehend Duran Duran and return him to Justice.  In retrospect she seems to be overly starry-eyed, perhaps even ditzy or air-headed, but those are all tolerable traits in a naked lady.  Are there parallels to \\"The Wizard of Oz\\" ?  Certainly there is Wonder in abundance.  In the end Justice is served all around.
B002BIMNDQ|5.0|Dr. Goldacre reviews many current topics in an informative but highly readable book. Instead of being verbose he has most of his support information online. With this approach he is able to stick to stay on topic without overwhelming the reader. The book can stand alone but for the reader who wants to dig deeper or check facts extra information is easy to find.
B0001I562I|5.0|This is a story about an eight-year-old boy, a space-ship and time travel.  That is the easy part.  The government is involved. They have the space ship for awhile in the beginning.  It soon develops that they actually had it in the middle, not the beginning.  It gets pretty tangled up.  It was pretty tangled up before anybody realized that anything was wrong.  By the time we get to the end, or what seems like the end, it seems like things will never get straightened out.  The boy can go home but not at the right time ... not anywhere near the right time.  The right time, of course, was back in the middle where everything started.  It might be possible to take him home to the right time, but can an 8-year old human survive the trip \\"backwards\\" ?  It's a long shot.  Should he risk it ?  I'm sure this sort of thing would never be allowed \\"today\\".  It's a classic Sci-Fi tale for dreamers of all ages.
B002MTTZ5I|5.0|I used to see Ralph Saenz (Michael Starr) and Russ Parish (Satchel) play in L.A. Van Halen tribute band Atomic Punks all the time to standing room only crowds. They were better than what Van Halen eventually turned into.  Ralph should have replaced Dave in the newly reformed Van Halen as Ralph does Dave better than Dave can these days.    This is a fun album full of great musicianship...way better than a lot of current bands. This is an updated Metal version of Spinal Tap. The naysayers obviously aren't getting it. Too bad. You better go back to your serious Neil Young music which is supposed to save the world. The rest of us are having fun with Steel Panther.
B0021L9MJG|4.0|I love Creepshow, it's my favorite horror movie, but I was disappointed there weren't more extras in the blu ray, since there weren't any real extras on the DVD from 10 years ago. You'd think with blu ray's capacity they'd include much more extras than the DVD, but it didn't happen, so that's the only reason I didn't give this five stars. The movie itself is awesome, even better in high def than on the old DVD.
1579125549|5.0|Polgar starts you off with very simple problems that gradually build in complexity. Rather than tell you what to look for, he lets you figure out the answers for yourself. Thus you learn to recognize the patterns that lead to checkmate.<br /><br />You can work every problem in sequence, gradually improving your skills, or just dip into it at random for puzzle-solving pleasure.<br /><br />Wonderful book, glad I bought it.
B000BNI90O|5.0|I resisted buying this for the longest time, since I already own the single disc soundtrack that came out with the film's release. I just saw \\"Fellowship\\" with a live orchestra last night at Radio City Music Hall in N.Y.C. and this item was available for purchase. I bought it without hesitation and do not regret it! Excellent music start to finish. The only regret I did have was the long line after the show to get Howard Shore's autograph... it was late and I couldn't wait. Oh well, maybe next year at the live orchestral performance of \\"The Two Towers\\"!!!
1932100660|4.0|I'm really not an expert in nutrition, but if it's really true that we Americans have got too much animal-based food in our diet *and* that the high percentage of animal-based food we eat is, in fact, a root cause of many of our illnesses, wow!!  ...  then this book [The China Study] is a real blockbuster of a title that we should all spend some time studying carefully.    Another title that might be good to combine this one with is \\"The end of overeating,\\" by David A. Kessler, MD. This second book talks about how the food industry hooks us by tweaking food by putting just the right amounts of stuff like sugar, fat, and salt into the food to make it similar to the nicotine in cigarettes. The Kessler book [The end of overeating] seems to be more about the psychological part of eating, while the Campbell book [The China Study] delves more into the physiological/biological/chemical part of eating. Both of these books are excellent, IMHO.

B0000262QW|1.0|Sorry, English isn't my native language.<br /><br />I am a classical music lover.<br /><br />From a view of classical music fan, I think that present jazz is sluggish. I think I have a glimpse of the cause and reason for the depression of jazz music today through &#34;Chick Corea - Return to Forever&#34;.<br /><br />In the classical music field, Pierre Boulez appeared in Bayreuth in 1976, &#34;Der Ring des Nibelungen&#34; was conducted by him for five years, and Bayreuth was reformed. He practiced his insistence &#34;The enemy of the classical music is a mannerism&#34; and denied the past.<br /><br />After that the classical music, that had been sluggish, became interesting. The classical music comes to be familiar and now even a manga, of which heroine is a piano student at an academy of classical music, gets a hit in Japan (Nodame Cantabile). So it has become easy to be familiar with the classical music even to people who usually do not listen to music (in the 1970's, it was impossible.).<br /><br />The Mahler boom occurred because of the appearance of CD (compact disc). We became to be able to get the CDs cheaply to obtain a large amount of masterpieces of the classical music. That is, the development of media made rather old music energetic. Digital recording improved the reproducibility of the classical music, and DVD made the opera familiar. SACD made listener's ear discriminating, so that the listeners of classical music came to request higher performance to the players.<br /><br />What has jazz done for these thirty years?<br /><br />I am a John Coltrane's fan. I can find the meaning and value that he in fact denied jazz. However, the meaning and value cannot be found from &#34;Return to Forever&#34;. After all I think that &#34;Return to Forever&#34; has neither broken the mannerism nor denied the past.<br /><br />What is the difference of &#34;Return to Forever&#34; from the music that progressive rock band made in the 1970's? And what kind of progress (that can't be found in punk rock and new wave) can be found in listening to &#34;Return to Forever&#34;?<br /><br />Percussions and CHICK COREA's electric piano find Santana.<br />JOE FARRELL's woodwinds remind King Crimson.<br />Lyrics make no sense.<br /><br />01 Return to Forever beats like &#34;Tarkus&#34; of Emerson Lake & Palmer.

B0002KVULG|5.0|I was really surprised to see so many people that have a poor opinion of this movie.  The movie is dark, because most of the scenes are at night, but I had no doubt it was in color, not black and white.  This is my absolutely favorite Dracula movie of all time.  I love the castle, I like that Dracula is handsome and sensuous, and I really like the way they unfold the story. To me, this is how the Dracula story should be.  This is the one I watch every year at Halloween.  I just don't see the things others are complaining about.

B00005QGAV|5.0|I think MJ did 4 really great albums. Off The Wall, Thriller, Bad & Dangerous. Dangerous is very underrated but it does have it's faults. Still you can jam, sing alone, rock out or whatever to this album. It can make you dance, sing, inspire you or just sadden you.    1 - Jam -  I really like this song. It's one of the last MJ songs that builds lyrically as well as the beat. Also one of MJ's songs that repeats the chorus, maybe too much. A great start to Dangerous.    2 - Why You Wanna Trip On Me - This song is a nice jam. Don't know how it would have done as a single. A bit angry and attempting to repeat the success of Leave Me Alone, just not as fun.    3 - In The Closet - One of my favorite MJ songs on the album, but suffers from too much chorus like Jam and a lot of the songs on here. I really like the interplay between \\"The Woman\\" and MJ though and that makes this song fun and easy to listen to.    4 - She Drives Me Wild - This is a damn good MJ song that went unreleased. I bet he could have had a nice video to it. Not as successful as The Way You Make Me Feel but the closest thing to it on this album besides In The Closet.    5 - Remember The Time - You can sing to it, dance to it watch MJ move to it in the video or just mellow out to it. I love the song but wish it had more lyrically. I guess if anything the 90's was all about the chorus. I always liked more lyrics and have the chorus be what is built up to or have the chorus support the rest of the song    6 - Can't Let Her Get Away - Usually when I listen to Dangerous I usually skip the hits (heard them a million times) and listen to the less popular or unrealsed songs. This is one of the best of them (along with She Drives Me Wild & Dangerous).    7 - Heal The World - Nice song. Inspirational, can sing or mellow out to it, but you really got to be in the mood for it. Not up there with We Are The World, Man In The Mirror or Earth Song, but still not bad.    8 - Black Or White - What can I say? Most popularsong and biggest hit on Dangerous. I can jam to it, sing it, bang my head, watch the video, laugh at it or enjoy MJ's dancing during and after the video. The panther dancing at the end of it is awesome. So what he grabbed his crotch. You know anyone who can dance like that? Didn't this so.    9 - Who Is It - I like this song and the greatest hits video version of it. I love how MJ did the live acapella to this on Opera's interview. Vastly underrated song and one of my favs on this or any MJ album. Even had it as a ringtone on my cell for people I didn't know. Who Is It?    10 - Give In To Me - Damn this song should have been a hit. Loved it as much as Who Is It! Hell even loved it more than Black or White. It was Dirty Diana for the 90's (to me).    11 - Will You Be There - You gotta be there to Free Willy. Really this song grew on me. A great song lyrically and sang to perfection by MJ. This is a song only MJ could do and pull off well. Song and Free Willy version of the video are really good and would listen to or watch anytime. Soothing, sad, emotional and the spoken poem at the end really clicked with MJ's life from then until his passing. Yes, MJ we (your fans) will be there, through thick and thin. Like you were there for us, we will always be there for you, also to support you legacy musically and your humanitarian efforts. We will never forget you!    12 - Keep The Faith - MJ going for the gospel feel ala Man In The Mirror, but his attempt turned out kinda flat. I like it, might listen to it every now and then, but if any one song could be cut from Dangerous, this would be my first choice.    13 - Gone Too Soon - If you enjoyed Usher's version of this and never heard the original you need to buy Dangerous. MJ's version (as always) was the best. Done in memory to Ryan White who died of AIDs, this is such a beautiful tribute. Also a great tribute to MJ himself. Wonder if he had that in mine as well when he did this song. Whatever his intentions. MJ you reallywere gone too soon...........    Dangerous - MJ's best unreleased song of the 90's that I am aware of right now. Would have been a great video. MJ sang it to perfection, you can jam to it, imagine what kinda video MJ would have made for it etc. One of my favorite unreleased MJ songs...........ever. Plus there was a really nice demo version of this song out there (I think on the Ultimate Collection cds, going by memory here). Very different mood for the song, almost a different song like how the demo to PYT was. I loved both versions. Here you get the album version.    Great album and a bit of trivia for ya. I read that Dangerous outsold Bad as an album and is MJ's 2nd biggest album ever! If that doesn't tell you anything don't know what will. This is perhaps MJ's most diverse album. A bit of something for everyone.
B001P5Q6F2|5.0|Lamb Of God have one upped themselves again.  This is a blistering album and easily my favourite so far.  The sound on this record is just pristine.  They sound more raw on this record than they have for a long time but the clarity is just mesmerising.  LOG are a speed metal band at heart and this really confirms it.  \\"Contractor\\" is a beast of a song with a huge ending. \\"In Your Words\\", \\"Set To Fail\\", \\"Grace\\", \\"Broken Hands\\", \\"Dead Seeds\\" and \\"Reclamation\\" are all up there with LOG's best. Blythe has never sounded better with his range, and is getting better with each album.  The guitars are breakneck and are typically huge, with Morton playing some of his best solo's. But I think the drums are the most impressive with Chris Adler's machine gun playing and absolute highlight(plus they have never been recorded better - big props to Josh Wilbur!). If you like LOG you will not be disappointed with this effort.

0375413405|5.0|This is a wonderful book on French cooking.  The directions are easy to follow and the results are really good.
B00000JLWW|5.0|To be honest, this is more critique than review, so if you're thinking of buying the DVD having yet to see the movie, I suggest you skip this and go straight to the next review or the ADD to BASKET button, which if you do you won't regret. But let's face it, just about everyone's seen this movie and if you have but are still considering purchasing the DVD as a gift or to have as a permanent copy, then you may safely read on because there's no intention here to put you off. On the contrary, I wish to extol the movie's virtues having had what could best be described as a Saul to Damascus conversion regarding a movie curmudgeons such as my x-self seemed to just love to hate.     A great spectacle hampered by a poor script. That appears to be the general feeling about Titanic, and one I used to harbor myself, but nothing could be wider off the truth, now, in my opinion. This script is as highly polished as the floor Cal Hockley slid upon as he chased Rose and Jack through the sinking ship. Those who rate the script poorly are, for one thing, likely confusing script with dialogue and for another, finding fault where there is so little. They're also forgetting, else not aware to begin with, that the characters' spoken lines are the lesser part of the script. They should realise that every picture, sound, mood, every jaw-dropping scene, every moment of joy, love, terror, every smile, frown, wince, lip-waver, and expression of fear on the characters' faces, has been written into the script. Then there's the characterisations, plot, pace, action, backdrops and coincidences, which are all carefully managed, weighted and envisaged by the scriptwriter. And they must all mesh with each other as they must with the dialogue. So this is in defense of a great script and that part of it subject to the most undue criticism, the perfectly formed love story.      When Rose deWitt Bukater sailed under the statue of liberty into New York harbor at the end of her voyage, it was lashing with rain. And significantly, though you'd be forgiven for missing this, Rose wasn't seeking shelter from the rain. Does anyone think the rain wasn't part of the script or that rain wasn't necessary to the story? It seems a trivial detail but to the scriptwriter the rain in the scene is everything. I'd go further and say the movie doesn't work without it. Rain cleanses. It reflects a change of mood. In terms of script dynamics alone, the rain marks the passing of time, and not just the sailing time of the rescue ship, Carpathia, from the disaster zone to New York, but also the eighty-four years separating the stories of young and old Rose. Rain is never just rain. It always has a function in a script. It's a dramatic device specifically chosen and precisely timed by the writer. Whether historically it rained or not as Carpathia docked is neither here nor there and matters not to the teller of this story. Here, more than anything, the rain symbolises a new beginning and the end to young Rose's story with the statue of liberty itself offering its own significance. The rain's also our cue to let Rose go, but without its cleansing, almost baptising effect, she cannot begin to make a new life for herself. Rose has to move on and we have to let her, as though we are steering the script with our expectations. Without the rain, Rose cannot become old Rose.    The script is near flawless, even given the almost cartoonish characterisations of Billy Zane's Cal Hockley and sidekick, David Warner's Lovejoy. But when I ask myself how such a man as Hockley, the spoiled, handsome and eligible heir to a major fortune would react to the provocation of his beautiful young fiancée falling for the charms of some scruffy kid, I expect the answer would be pretty angrily. The dastardly villain might seem a cheap device, but for me it works exceptionally well in Titanic. Watch how long the character tries to maintain his composure and win Rose around - but his shallowness, cowardice and jealousy can't help but surface like scum in the end as he effectively sinks himself in Rose's esteem. Simplistically drawn he might be, but Hockley falls just the right side of believable and with that equal propensity for charm and flying off the handle makes all the right moves for a classic villain...   (more at UK...)
B002EP30YC|4.0|This was a mostly gripping read. Some of the content was a little disturbing and in other places the story dragged, but the characters especially 'the girl' of the title were fascinating, in fact it was the final pages of the book that convinced me I should read the follow up books - till then I wasn't certain I would. By and large I happily turned the pages.
B002GZQY6Q|4.0|I LOVE Porcupine Tree, first of all. They are my favorite band after RUSH.  Having said that, I don't find The Incident to be on the same level as Signify, In Absentia, and Deadwing. It's a good, solid CD, but it didn't blow me away like those did.   Having said that, it is a huge improvement over FOABP, which was my least favorite PT recording.  Having said THAT, does my opinion matter to those that will read this? Probably not. I am not a musician. I am not a music critic. I just know what sounds good to my ear and what doesn't.     So buy this CD and form your own opinion. That is what I always do.

B002KDUDG6|1.0|Michael Buble has tremendous talent - I am a BIG fan, but this CD takes no advantage of the range of Buble's voice, no expression of subtle tone or emotion - no vocal keeness, nothing perceptive or artful - nothing to arouse the spirit or the soul -  and the musical background has no imagination - this CD is an empty glass - DOA.
1905654294|4.0|I have never before written a review but here it goes. I just wanted to say that, I enjoyed this book very much. Where the other three were outstanding this book was in my opinion just good. The worst part is that, for all we know, it was the last book in the legacy of Bella and Edward.  The best part was that she left it open, so that there may be at some point in time a book five.
1596912863|4.0|I listened to Austenland on audio on a long drive alone. It was absolutely perfect for the occasion. Austenland is the story of Jane Hayes, a single New Yorker, graphic designer and Jane Austen (especially the Colin Firth BBC miniseries of Pride and Prejudice) devotee. When her quirky aunt passes away, Jane learns she was left a peculiar thing in the will: a two-week holiday trip to an English estate where she will live in Austen's time. It's essentially an elaborate Jane Austen role-playing theme park, complete with period costumes, customs and lack of technology. The men are played by actors, and our heroine, despite acknowledging Darcy has ruined her real relationships by being too good, has a tough time letting go of her modern persona and relaxing.<br /><br />Austenland is pure, brilliant fantasy and utterly dreamlike for Austen fans, but the comedy keeps the story from slipping into schmaltzy. Even those who feel dear Jane is teetering on overexposure would enjoy the satire. It's a quick, delightful tale, and Katherine Kellgren's reading was marvelous. Her voices were delightful and helped bring out the personalities of characters.

0486650677|5.0|Before reading this book, I knew almost nothing about analytical mechanics. My first text books taught Physics from a Newtonian approach, using mostly vectors and potentials. So, the first time I encountered Lagrangians and Hamiltonians I could not understand what these concepts meant. Because of that many areas of Theoretical Physics were forbidden for me: Phase and configuration space, Noether's theorem, Hilbert relativistic equations, Feynman quantum-mechanical interpretation of the principle of least action, and so on.<br /><br />So, two years ago, I decided to buy this book. And what I encountered? A systematical and pedagogical approach to analytical mechanics, which enabled me to acquire the fundamentals of the subject.<br /><br />For me, the most interesting features of this book are the following:<br /><br />1) It explains the differences between VARIATION and DIFFERENTIATION, something that most books in the subject, leave behind.<br />2) It explains clearly D'Alembert Principle and the Principle of Virtual Work.<br />3) From those principles he derives the Principle of Least Action, using just elemental calculus.<br />4) He introduces the reader in Legendre's transformation and the relations between the two fundamental quantities of Analytical mechanics: Lagrangian and Hamiltonian.<br />5) You get the equations of movement corresponding to those quantities: Euler-Lagrange (Lagrangian) and canonical (Hamiltonian) equations.<br />6) A powerful insight in Configuration and Phase Spaces is given, including the wonderful Liouville's theorem.<br />7) Lanczos shows the analogies between Optics and Mechanics when he explains the Hamilton-Jabobi equations.<br /><br />So, why to learn Analytical Mechanics and why to buy this book?? These are my reasons:<br /><br />1) From a historical point of view, Analytical Mechanics was developed by Continental Mathematicians like Maupertuis, Euler, D'Alembert and Lagrange as a rival system to the Newtonian one exposed in the Principia Mathematica. Newton used vectors and potentials. Euler and Lagrange employed the Principle of Least Action.<br />2) It was Analytical Mechanics the first to develop the principle of energy conservation. Even when this principle in its general form was developed by Wilhelm von Helmholtz in 1847, the conservation of the sum of kinetic and potential energy was well known to Euler a century earlier.<br />3) The concept of phase space is very important in Thermodynamics. In fact, the definition of entropy given by Ludwig Boltzmann refers to the logarithm of a volume in phase space. Liouville theorem, which states the conservation of such phase space volumes, is very usefull today in black hole thermodynamics.<br />4) The quantum-mechanical interpretation of the Principle of Least Action given by Richard Feynmann was a fundamental contribution in the development of Quantum Field Theory, so any student who desires to progress in this field, must have substantial knowledge of Analytical Mechanics.<br /><br />So, to all of you that eventually decide to buy this book, I wish you a good reading.and Lagrange employed the Principle of Least Action.  2) It was Analytical Mechanics the first to develop the principle of energy conservation.

B001AVCFJM|5.0|Yes folks, you read that right I saw this movie 18 times in theaters and was completely blown away. I went to my first screening, not expecting much. Was I ever wrong. Although I am a Star Trek fan (my favorite is the original series) this film stands out because of its excellent writing, acting and directing. I tend to wait for DVD releases as many films are not as good as they should be, and I am so glad I saw this film in theaters. I salute the director and writers for making an exeptional film that both takes Star Trek in a bold new direction, yet remains true to the spirit of the original series.<br /><br />The cast is not simply a group of beautiful faces, but a wonderful group of character actors whose talent really shines. Zachary Quinto as Spock is outstanding. His subtle nuances really show the Vulcan-Human relationship in ways the orginal series couldn't have imagined. I love the fact that Spock has a temper (no purging of emotions in Kohlinar). This makes for more interesting character development, note the exceptional scene when he finally loses his temper.  Chris Pine's interpretation of Kirk is also outstanding. He makes Kirk a likable human dynamo. You see Kirk's development in finding his destiny and root for him all the way. Karl Urban as McCoy is also incredible. I remember him from his portrayal of Cesar in the Xena and Hercules shows several years ago and he has McCoy's accent and wit down. The lovely Zoe Saldana brings wit, intelligence and a depth of emotion to Uhura. She gives as good as she gets, but still is caring and supportive of her chosen love interest. I won't spoil that one here, but I love the idea of the two of them together! It is a logical selection, I think. I love the fact that Sulu and Chekhov are also given vital roles that both actors handle beautifully. We get to see Sulu in action and his prowess in piloting after a funny first time. Chekhov gets to show his expertise and why he really belongs on the Enterprise. I also have to mention Bruce Greenwood as Captain Pike, I loved his character better than the one on the original series.<br /><br />The special effects are also outstanding. Space is full of beautiful colors in this film. The whole look is different. I have several co-workers who are not Trek fans who saw this film more than once because it had  great story. I haven't been excited about a movie or seen one this often since the original Star Wars came out. I had Trek withdrawal after its run was over. I can't wait until it is out on DVD and Blu-Ray. Do yourself a favor, buy this film on DVD, a rental is not enough. Too many films are made with lots of special effects and not enough story (Transformers 2, I was expecting more and got less). Star Trek is not one of those. Outstanding film and my favorite of all time.

044022425X|4.0|While this book is still better than 99 percent of the rest of the books available, when compared to the others in the series it is a step down. It doesn't seem to have its own identify as much as it serves as a link for the preceding book an the next in the series. While it is a link, it is a very long link. However, like all the books in the series, it reads quickly for its length because it is a stirring series with well-told tales. The narrative, however, does not have the same directed flow of the previous Outlander novels, and seems more of a placeholder. That said, I can't wait to read the next in the series.
0061706620|3.0|It was well written and believable as far as being the voice of John Winchester, but it could have been a lot better. When this book came out I was excited to read it as I am a huge fan of the show. It started off good enough, but the farther into it that you read it becomes less like a journal about the trials of surviving in a life submerged in a supernatural world and more like a course book on mythology. As you read the anecdotes about the three Winchester men begins to diminish and it's just his difficult to follow notes on different beings and the folklore behind the stories. I can assure you it is not any where as interesting as the show. I was pretty disappointed.
B002GZQYMK|5.0|No track on The Resistance is as tight and perfect as, say, \\"Map of the Problematique\\".  One of the best things about Muse is their ability to make each song a complete and unique work of perfection.  The kind of perfection that transports me to another dimension and makes me say, \\"THAT is the best aural experience I've ever had.\\" - each song, each time.    Not to say The Resistance is bad, not at all.  I gave it five stars because the site does not allow me to give it seven.  Some of their other albums on the other hand would be ten stars.  By comparison, only the three Exogenesis tracks plus two other songs transport me to that eargasmic experience where just about everything on Origin of Symmetry does.  But that is already doing a good deal better than most other artists I've ever listened to, and I grew up in the 70s.     Part of the magic of Muse is the juxtaposition of raw, violent depth with soaring melodic beauty.  The Resistance remains too much in the middle ground between the two.  What is missing might be the glorious sensation of being torn between those opposing polarities, although there is certainly the soaring beauty in places, certainly in Exogenesis.  Others have said that Exogenesis has no climactic weight; I disagree - I think it is a masterpiece.  Far from ripping off Beethoven, I hear it as Bellamy's ANSWER to Beethoven.  Maybe not quite the caliber yet, but if Matthew Bellamy continues to grow as a composer over his lifetime, he could definitely wind up equivalent to the classical greats.    On the other hand, I was underwhelmed by \\"United States of Eurasia\\".  But then I have problems with the song in the first place that may have biased my ear.  If Muse has designs on stardom in the United States (of America), releasing this CD first in places on September 11, (yes, the 11th), and then touring the U.S.A. with U2, a band with a huge following among the older generation, Muse might have made a bad miscalculation.  More than half the country may have voted for Obama, but only a minority want to see the USA taken down and replaced by a different superpower.  I do not think that is the song's meaning, but U2 fans aren't going to dig into Matt's philosophies like I do - they're just going to see the title and take it wrong.  As for USoE itself, unlike the way Moonlight Sonata flowed behind Exogenesis III, some of the Queen \\"copy\\" struck me as an unnecessary and disconnected tribute.  The Middle Eastern sound, and other explorations were wonderful however, and I cannot say whether after 100 listens I will love this song or dislike it.  Some Muse songs take a while to grow on me.    That may be true of the whole album.  It is certainly different, but variety is one of the things I love about Muse.  I am anxious to see where they go from here.  The Resistance is a slight misfire into a lot of new territory, but it's still Muse.      Edit:  Oh yeah, 100 listens later, it just gets better.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|I don't watch that much TV and I don't have Showtime.  I discovered Dexter only because they are constantly filming in my neighborhood.  The first time I walked by the location set, I asked what they were filming, and when they said \\"Dexter,\\" I said, \\"Oh!  That's a kid's show, right?\\" (I think there was a kid's show called \\"Dexter's Lab.\\") To a few guffaws and a sarcastic \\"Um, no.\\"  No, it sure is not a kid's show.    A couple of weeks ago, after watching the fake Miami police running around this SoCal neighborhood again, I decided to take a look at Dexter on Netflix.  I knew it had good reviews.  The first couple of shows were interesting, compelling, and almost too gross to watch.  So there were days between watching each episode.  But after the third or fourth show, I was completely hooked.  I needed one Dexter a night just like Dexter needed to \\"put out the trash.\\"    The characters are better drawn and better acted than almost any TV I've ever seen.  Even the side characters are richly fleshed out, and you get to sympathize with many of them in different ways.  It's CSI on steroids, with people you grow to care about.  The dialog is realistic, though too many f-bombs for me.  You forget you are watching a show.  It's edge-of-your-seat time, and woe on anyone who disturbs you while you are watching.      When I watch CSI (Vegas only), my mind never forgets that it's a show, written by somebody, and my mind is always thinking alongside the viewing to see which way the plot will go, and which things will be planned-unpredictable, and which will be set ups of predictability.  To me, true success at greatness means SHUTTING DOWN that parallel thinking.      And when I watch Dexter, I forget all else.  I highly recommend it for un-squeamish adults.
0385504225|1.0|This comment is addressed to Mr. Brown (and his readers, hopefully, soon to be less):    I am a voracious reader and was looking forward to your new novel.  I received a gift certificate for my birthday from my daughter and preordered the book from Amazon - What a waste!! - not only of my daughter's money, but of my time.  I read the novel to the very end and never found anything new, provocative or interesting.    As a matter of fact, your style was stilted and unimaginative and the story line ridiculous - a total rehash of your previous writing.  Mr. Brown, I would like my money back (I will return your book) so that I can buy an excellent book by another author.  You have convinced me to never preorder a book again - it seems that the many reviews I have since read have been right on target. You and your publisher should be ashamed for probably spending millions of dollars on advertising for such an insipid book - no wonder publishing is dying - no one can trust either the publisher or author - money rules!!    To reiterate the New York Times Review of October 11, 2009 (which I wish I had read two weeks ago) - \\"What the hell, Dan?\\"

0385504225|1.0|When I started to read the book I thought \\"wow - this story is really gripping!\\". Unfortunately the whole book is on a steady downslope and the ending is the most frustrating part of it. The characters are improbable and unbelievable. What with all the patriotic statements (\\"our great nation, the crossroads of this great nation,...) and the totally misleading \\"explanation\\" of how and why waterboarding is \\"so effective\\" I was wondering if Dick Cheney had ghost-written at least part of the book. Plus Langdon and his lady-friend do some really cool sight-seeing in Washington towards the end - the rising sun reflects off the top of the washington monument, wow, there is a really stunning ending to a story.  I did not like it.

B001TW69J4|5.0|There have been a few musical projects over the past 10 years or so that have sparked the imgination: TMV: De-loused in a Comatorium, Anathema: Judgment, BoC: Geogaddi, BBS: Full of Elevating Pleasures, Cynic: Traced in Air, FB: The Sense Apparatus, Isis: Panopticon, Phideaux: Doomsday Afternoon, PT: In Absentia, Riverside: Second Life Syndrome, Trentmoller: The Last Resort... the list is impressive; everything from electronic/trip-hop to metal (of its various sorts).     Animals as Leaders self-titled debut easily places itself right alongside these genre-busting standouts. Tosin Abasi is a genius on the guitar pure and simple. His command of the instrument is beyond impressive, coaxing out melody after mind-boggling melody.    In order to keep this review somewhat brief I will say that my only niggle of a negative I have about this album are the drums; although very well programmed, I still think that someone like a Gavin Harrison from PT could really elevate this material even further (as witnessed by his collaborations with 05ric on \\"Drop\\" and \\"Circles\\" albums). However, this little nitpick is just that and not really worth getting too worked up over. The entire album is a treasure trove of ideas for those that like their music sensibilities stretched a little bit now and then.    High recommended!
B002KDUDG6|4.0|Voices such as Michael Buble are timeless, priceless and captivating. His latest project, \\"Crazy Love\\" showed the vulnerability of his voice and musical capability. The first two tracks were  a bit risky but paid off because of that voice which has a magnetizing effect. \\"Haven't Met You Yet\\" is a hit single and puts the listener into a groovy, bubbly dancing mood. The singles, \\"Georgia On my Mind\\", \\"Crazy Love\\", are classic Michael Buble. The cd project talks about the drama which surrounds love---the heartache, the sadness, the beauty, the aura and the complications of that thing called love. For those who love old school jazz, contemporary jazz and new school jazz, this cd project is an absolute must. I wonder what Old Blue Eyes would say? I am guessing, He would be asking for a duet!! Bravo Michael....keep making sweet music for our ears.
B002S0OBFK|5.0|This film really scared me! The comparisons to Blair Witch are certainly in order.  An essentially point-of-view film throughout, it does a great job of slowly unfolding the story from both the actors' perspective, as well as their subconscious' perspective. We get to observe them by day, then by night, both while they're awake and asleep.  A few observations.  First, although its ultra low budget, it doesn't really feel that way.  The purposeful focusing of handheld/tripod camera on the actors relegates the low budget aspects to inconsequential impact.  Second, the acting was surprisingly good.  As the movie progresses, the characters undergo progressively worse paranormal activity, and they do a good job of realistically portraying someone subjected to that type of stress.  Third, the film's crescendo worked well; gradually, the paranormal activities increase in frequency and severity, and culminate quite dramatically.  Although the film progresses in a day-by-day format with the film split between the day and night activities (which, in turn, can lend to precarious predictability), it is pulled off well.  Yes, the film often focuses on the things that happen to the couple while in bed, but their experiences vary enough that each scene is still highly effective.  Fourth, the movie did an outstanding job of scaring me.  Being ultra low budget, they were forced to make good use of low tech approaches for creating mood, and they did an outstanding job of that.  I constantly found myself asking what is going to happen next.  Although the result was often predictable, the mood set and built made for lots of good jumps.  Lastly, my only complaint is some of the unrealism.  For example (SPOILER), the couple refuse to leave the house in light of someone's admonition that the spirit will follow them anywhere.  If i were experiencing the types of things they did, I'd at least want to be somewhere with lots of people.  This, and a few other non sequiturs did lend a bit of incredulity, but any good fan of horror should be able to accept these and enjoy the scares.  I certainly did.credulity, but any good fan of horror should be able to accept these and enjoy the scares.  I certainly did.

0385504225|2.0|Although I didn't appreciate the way the DaVinci Code weaved together fact and fantasy regarding Christianity, it was an extremely captivating novel.  This title again features the main character Robert Langdon.  This time he is uncovering truths of the Masons hidden within Washington, D.C.  For anyone who has any knowledge of the Masonic Lodge, it is evident that Brown returns to his pattern of weaving together accurate information with dramatic license.  With this book however, his plot is rather dull and simply too far-fetched to keep the reader engaged.  Perhaps there was just too much pressure to write a second novel that possesses movie-making potential.  Regardless, I was disappointed with this one.  It may sell a lot of copies, but the reason will be more because of the preceding title rather than the content found here.

I would recommend this book as the majority of it is worth the disappointment at the end.

B001GM28HO|5.0|I've never really been one for pop music, but Lady Gaga's CD The Fame has me hooked. Her lyrics and her glam-rock persona are weird enough to distinguish her from your average scantily-clad female pop star. The CD is engaging with solid danceable beats and catchy rhythms and lyrics. Anyone who has listened to the radio in the past few months has heard \\"Let's Dance\\" or \\"Pokerface\\", but The [[ASIN:B001GJ2ZP2 The Fame]]maintains the high energy, top of the request-list quality on almost every song.

6301971272|5.0|************This is a review for the product, not the movie***************    The image quality is really improved compared to the previous releases. This new amazing transfer is crisp clear and mantains the color and tone of the film. The audio is enhanced with a 5.1 track, and you can tell that the sound people did a really good job replicating some of the sound effects to achieve the 5.1 sensation, since the original track was mono.  The only thing I regret is that this is an extended cut of the film (a few scenes were added and Eastwood and Wallach returned to make the dubbing). This is not a bad thing at all, but it would have been nice to have also the theatrical cut, wich is the one everybody is familiarized with. Don't get me wrong, the additional scenes mantain the same quality as the rest of the film, but... they are still additional scenes. Plus, you can really tell that Tucco and Blondie sound like old men on those scenes.    The package is great, you get a cardboard cover (wich is not the cheap one, and has some emboss on the title), a booklet and several postcards that feature the posters from different countries, like France, Italy, Japan, and more.    Disc one contains the movie and a commentary, plus the original italian audio (only Eastwood, Wallach and Van Cleef are dubbed here).    Disc two contains the extras wich not all are extremely interesting, but worth to watch at least once: A few documentaries about the old west that make no mention to the movie and a few documentaries about Leone, Morricone and the restoring of the film.    Overall, a great edition at a great price. I'm from Argentina and let me tell you, even with the shipping and the currency convertion, this movie was an amazing deal.

B002C6K7NU|4.0|As far as this new album goes, It Rocks! And the best Southern/Country Rock Album to come out in years! I'd even go so far as to say the musical content alone would make this Country/Western/Southern Rock Album of the Year! but not without saying this first! The true spirit of the U.S.A. came from clinging to GOD & Guns, and what it was founded upon, Independence from French/British, How the West was Won,(Native American Indians pretty much got screwed in the deal didn't they? More Native Americans were slaughtered or were starved to death than the Nazi Holocaust, Look it up!), Civil War, Vietnam the list goes on and on! But where is God in all this?     When I first heard OBAMA mention how people are bitter (against the Liars and thieves of our very own Government, Corporate Greed, Unemployment, Needless Wars, etc, etc, I know I am), and the only thing we have left (\\"Cling to our Religion and Guns\\") is our \\"Religion\\" and \\"Guns\\" as a last resort, whether for hunting or organized Martial Law (as we've been given according to the Constitutional Bill Of Rights), I can't help but fully agree! and feel OBAMA is fully in touch with present day America. Although Lynyrd Skynyrd is known for taking things out of context (as well as many politicians) and taking things way too personal (Southern Man - Neil Young, lyrics about the slaves and plantation owners...Not the present day Southern Man in general), I knew exactly what Obama was talking about the first time I heard him say it, and it wasn't a slam on Bitter Americans, it was the truth! Speaking in reference to just how upset we Americans are over Deceptive Money Mongering Politicians and their Cohorts. For anyone to say it was offensive or insulting sees only what they want to see, especially when those words come from a black man right? Lynyrd Skynyrd IMO is still a bit backwoods and living in the past when it comes to Racial Unity (Southern Man/Northern Man Democrat/Republican, What Ever! only keeps the country divided). Maybe it's time Skynyrd put away the Biased nonsense and actually started believing in the Good Book (GOD) where all men are created \\"EQUAL\\" -  End the Diversity and become one America! United We Stand, Divided We Fall\\" (a house divided against itself cannot stand). Isn't that the true American Spirit? Or do we continue to insult the world with our biased mentality thinking we are better, even between our own country's races? There is good and bad in all, No race or country is exempt! Now lets pull it \\"Together\\" America and let's \\"CHANGE\\" for the better! Fight the Good Fight...for the good of mankind! If not for the sake of your Children and the world you leave behind.    Would have given it 5 stars but didn't agree with some of the lyrical content.

Francis Ford Coppola clearly states why he made the original the way it is and in particular why he took out the (slow and confusing) French Plantation scene. There is a lot of the French Plantation scene shown in Hearts of Darkness - A Filmmaker's Apocalypse so Redux is really not the first time the scene is shown although you don't see the entire scene in the documentary you aren't missing anything hence the reason Coppola took it out! The addition helicopter/Playboy scene is useless and they didn't even film the entire script of that segment due to the pouring rain.    I just want to message that IMO \\"Redux\\" is a rip off. The rabid fans (like me) of Apocalypse Now must see it and own it but know it for what it is... another way to get at your money for little substance in return.    The original version RULES!  :)    Thanks for reading,    Rick  Austin, TX  PS: Charlie Don't Surf !!!!!!!
6305428042|5.0|This movie has been an annual Halloween and fall kick off at our house since my kids were tiny.  It's a little slap-stick corny but isn't that the point?  Even the evil Sanderson sisters have a kind of bungling sweetness to them.
0545123267|5.0|I just finished this book about ten minutes ago-let me say the ending is fantastic- and went right online to see if there was a sequel coming! (luckily there is one coming out next year called Linger)!  This book entranced me from the beggining and kept me turning pages to see what type of adventures Grace and Sam would get into.  The only book i could relate this to is the Twilight series because it is about two people in love who have to fight against an unusual problem to stay together.  As the chapters switch between Sam and Graces minds, you get the full story from two points of view.  I absolutely LOVED this book and can NOT say enough good things about it! Thankyou Maggie Stiefvater!
0385504225|2.0|I listened to the audio book.  It was long, long book. I liked the idea of the race against time.  I liked the villain of the story. Lots of good clues and links to clues moving forward. The problem was the ending.  Not enough at risk.  Even at the end it seemed to go on and on with opinions on science vs. religion kind of forgetting all about the villain.  For a writer who produced very good other books, this one was a big let down.  Can't recommend reading it, and would not go see it if they made a movie out of it. I think I'd be snoozing in the theater.
B001U0HBPG|3.0|The Bottom Line:    Despite its long length The Curious Case of Benjamin Button doesn't make viewers want to go to the bathroom, but its shaky premise, overly familiar screenplay, meh performances and lack of standout scenes (though the brief battle between the tugboat and U-Boat is very well stone) make this a film to skip: there's just not enough to recommend about the picture, which in no universe was one of 2008's 5 best.    2.5/4
B001AQTWF2|4.0|What's good with it? Great song selection. Many of the sounds sound familiar even though they are new. From the Africa (Toto) sounding `Nothing But Love', the soul drenched `Worth It', the tight, percolating mid tempo beat of `Call You Tonight'(which actually sounds like it has sampled 'She's like the wind' from Dirty Dancing) the poppy, retro sounding, eighties beat of `For The Lovers' and the acerbic but excellent, obviously autobiographical 'Salute', Whitney Houston and Clive Davis have assembled a selection of songs that will stand the test of time and represent the Whitney of this era. `I Got You' sounds like a long lost soul classic. Clive Davis promised a new album by Whitney doing what she does best with no gimmicks. From that point of view the album certainly delivers. Not many lung busting ballads this time around although the R Kelly produced title track comes close to Whitney at her ballad best. In every album there has always been a cover version of an old song. This time, it's the Donny Hathaway paean to forgiveness ` A Song For You' that get the treatment. Although a considerable departure from the original, Whitney really digs her heels in for this souped up and discofied version, which is very good indeed. In fact, all in all, after 'Call You Tonight' it is the best track on the album. If you liked, `I'm every woman' you will love this. Of the two songs that Whitney co-wrote, the Akon produced duet `Like I never left' is the better one.   What's wrong with it? Unfortunately the voice that sold millions of `Whitney Houston' Whitney' and `The Bodyguard OST' is no longer what it used to be. There are flashes of the old Whitney on `Call you tonight'. An attempt to dig deep on the sparse, piano led ballad`I look to you' which like `I Will Always Love You' is designed to showcase the voice, sort of falls flat. In fact, in the opening bars of this title track, she sounds positively hoarse as she attempts to sing in her lower register. The lead off single `Million Dollar Bill' is good but it pales when compared to other tracks and just makes Whitney sound like yet another, distinctly average, run of the mill R&B singer. It is quite disappointing considering that this track was co-produced by the ever-reliable Alicia Keys. In my opinion, `For the Lovers' or `Call You Tonight' should have been the first single, re-establishing Whitney into the era in which she first became popular. She sings very convincingly on these two and seems very comfortable.  `I didn't know my own strength' is particularly disappointing being schmaltzy, overblown and over sung.     All in all, a very good albumen by Miss Houston and one fuelled by the experience of life that she has now brought into her work. None more so evident than in `Salute'.
B0020MKTOS|4.0|The Bottom Line:    No one is going to accuse Gran Torino of being subtle and the performances by the neophyte Hmong actors sometimes aren't great, but the film is undeniably effective, with much more humor than expected (to be honest I laughed more in this film than in most comedies) a pitch-perfect performance by Clint and an ending slightly but significantly different than I predicted; it's not the greatest film Clint's ever made but it's a solid piece of entertainment.    3/4
B001GM7GO4|1.0|Remastered, that is. This item is beautifully packaged but the sound is unchanged from the 1986 original which was poor even then! Compared to the recent remasters of the first 2 Boston albums, this is a total disaster and the supposed SHM adds nothing. Buy only if you're a (rich) completist.
B001PPLJIQ|3.0|The Bottom Line:    A decent film for its first two-thirds despite Kate Winslet's occasionally laughable accent, The Reader's lamentable third act turns what could have been a moderately-insightful film about German post-WWII guilt into a middling piece of Oscar-bait with a phoned-in performance by Ralph Fiennes and a whole bunch of contrived, artificial scenes; even in the weak year that was 2008 in film the idea that this middlebrow piece of filmmaking got a Best Picture and Director nomination is ridiculous.    2.5/4

B0024FAR5M|5.0|Do not start watching this set unless you have a few hours to spend! the storyline is compelling. The characters are all well developed and interesting. Even the most sociopathic of them all leaves you wondering a question that gets asked often \\"what did your mother do to you when you were a kid?\\"<br /><br />The show is rude, crude and violent beyond words. Enjoy the addiction.
1568987846|5.0|I purchased this book after seeing it highlighted in Better Homes and Gardens.  Choosing this as a gift for someone on my Christmas list, I was enticed by the simplicity of the photos I saw in the sneek peeks.  The actual size of the book is small, considering that the photos contain such sweet detail.  This is the only negative comment, as the content is simply lovely.  After purchasing the book, I have considered keeping this \\"Christmas gift\\" for myself.  I guess that's a good sign it's a good gift. :o)

B001AK3S4Y|5.0|Had seen this movie on TV a number of times, but never got into it till I happened to watch it on TV one night. I really got into it and found myself getting a kick out of it. I ordered the second movie and it's great too. If you like a camp action movie that's just a be different then you'll like this and the second movie.
B001TH8UUA|5.0|I got an email from Amazon announcing their new line of AmazonBasics cables. They said that their goal was to make a high quality cable and sell it at a very reasonable price.    They have achieved that goal.    I ordered two of the six foot HDMI cables and on nine foot cable for about eight bucks each.    The cable came in a simple cardboard box with nothing but a twist tie aside from the cable (which is a good thing, I hate the plastic blister packs that cut your hands and unnecessary stuff in the box to go in the landfill).    The cable has a solid, quality feel to it. Nothing feels cheap or chintzy.    Connecting the cable between my TV and several compontents including my brand new Samsung Blu Ray player, the connection just worked every time.     For comparison purposes, I bought a $50 super delux, high end, will solve all the problems in your life (according to the sales guy) HDMI cable at Radio Shack. Connecting the AmazonBasics cable to the same Blu Ray player as the fancy cable I saw **NO DIFFERENCE**!     Looking into it I found out that HDMI is a standard that is run by an organization. In order for anyone to make an HDMI cable and put the HDMI logo on it (which the AmazonBasics cable does), the cable must be made to the HDMI organizations standards. So the group basically tells the companies how the cable must be made in order to be given the HDMI logo. The long and short of it is that cheap cable or expensive cable, it must work to the same standards in order to have the HDMI logo.    So, super fancy $50 cable gets thrown back across the counter to Radio Shack guy for return and AmazonBasics cable gets a new home in back of my entertainment center.    I'm now going to purchase several more of these for family and friends to have as spares since they don't know any better and will get suckered by the sales guy at best buy into buying a $50 Monster Cable HDMI cable that does nothing better than this one.
B00288KNJU|5.0|I loved Coraline.  It was a very unique animated movie and I think it looks amazing on Blu Ray.  I will warn you to watch it all the way through and judge for yourself whether or not to let your kids watch it.  It is not what I would call a childrens movie.  It has some scary and creepy moments.
B002KDUDG6|5.0|Very pleased with the new CD! I'm surprised at the mixed reactions. I LOVE it!! Huge Buble fan.
B001CN2WXM|5.0|Director: Curtis Hanson<br />Writer: James Ellroy, Brian Helgeland, Curtis Hanson<br />Starring: Kevin Spacey, Russell Crowe, Guy Pearce, Kim Basinger, Danny DeVito, James Cromwell<br /><br />This is a fantastic movie featuring great performances from everyone involved. And not only great performances, but some of the best work in the whole careers of many of the actors. Basinger won an Oscar for best supporting actress, and the movie also took home the Academy Award for best adapted screenplay. It was nominated in seven other categories, not the least of which were best director and best picture.<br /><br />It is the mid 1950's. In the wake of a violent multiple homicide at a local diner, three L.A. cops investigate the truth in their own, very different ways. Their quest for justice requires them to rethink their morals and motivations as it leads them into the darkest and highest levels of corruption in the city.<br /><br />This is one of my favorite movies. It doesn't quite crack my top ten, but it's up there. It's a very intriguing story told through masterful performances from the whole cast. Everything about this movie keeps you engaged in the evolution of the three main cops involved. The ensemble works together so well to draw you in and keep you on the edge of your seat until the thrilling conclusion. The stark contrast in their characters is perfectly complimented by the all-too believable portrayal of 1950's Los Angeles. Set design and art direction are spot on (another Oscar nomination), and the original music by Jerry Goldsmith evokes the classic gritty detective story without becoming stereotypical or cliche.<br /><br />This is neo-film noir at its absolute finest.<br /><br />Final Score: 10/10
B000UNYJXQ|4.0|I wish all the people attending the Tea parties the past few months had watched this video first. What we really need is not the Baucus/Obama plan but real health care and insurance reform. Not the watered down lobbist manipulated version that we are going to get that will cost too much and accomplish too litle.
B001SMC91M|3.0|Tell `Em What Your Name Is! is the first, and probably last, album of the soul/funk genre that I own. It's simply not my thing, so take from my review what you will.<br /><br />Several years ago I saw Robert Randolph open for Eric Clapton and was fairly impressed with the jam style. I don't go out of my way to see or listen to these types of bands, but I do appreciate some good upbeat music at an open air festival, or just outdoors in general (like a backyard gathering). I have to say that the organ is one of my least favorite instruments, though. Black Joe Lewis & the Honeybears incorporate the organ of course, but it's tolerable I guess.<br /><br />I like the guitar work the most, as I usually do for most artists. It's very bluesy. Joe Lewis has a distinct James Brown flavor, so if you like James Brown, enjoy. Overall the music is funky, bluesy, and above all lively. That said, Black Joe Lewis & the Honeybears would be more appreciated live rather than inside on your stereo. I think the vibe would be so much better live.
B002GHHJU4|5.0|This has to be one of my favorite soundtrack!<br />It has very good music, my favorites are \\"Kiss with a Fist\\", \\"Finishing School\\", \\"Through the Trees\\", and \\"New Prospective\\", this is highly recommended! Amazing. :D
B000TXZVGQ|5.0|At least a decade before it's time.  the writing in this series is right on and if you can't relate maybe you were in a coma or grew up in another country or something.  Everytime I watch another episode I have a new favorite character.  Nine so far, not to mention the awesome music you've turned me on to.  Juliana Hatfield was a great touch and I've become a lifelong fan of hers.  A shout out to paul dooley, he can be a judge, a dad to patty and susan lewis and I saw him as a car salesman in something else lately, and he can do these convincingly well. Great acting all around.  I imagine Tino is a (slightly older) male version of Rayanne.

B000R8YC18|5.0|Probably the most grittiest film from the 1970's, \\"Taxi Driver\\" stars Robert DeNiro as a New York cab driver who falls for a girl (played by Cybil Shepherd) working as a supporter for a would-be Senator. After she dumps him the taxi driver decides to garner her attention by attempting to shoot the politician in cold blood. The other plot of the movie focuses on the DeNiro character discovering a young prostitute (played by Jodie Foster) and his attempts to get her pimp away from her. The movie is well-known for its use of firearms and the line \\"You talkin' to me?\\" The film is violent, especially the last moments of the film, but this kind of motion picture had to be made to show the seediest side of New York City and how people survive in a metropolis. The movie garnered 4 Oscar nods including ones for Best Picture, Best Actor for DeNiro, and Best Supporting Actress for Foster. This set includes a \\"Making-of Documentary\\" which is informative and entertaining with interviews with the cast and crew. The American Film Institute listed \\"Taxi Driver\\" as \\"One Of The Best Films Of All Time!\\".
0142410705|3.0|If you are familiar with John Green, you probably already know his winning formula: a nerdy nice guy with a funny side-kick best friend, meets and falls in love with a mysterious popular but ultimately unhappy girl, then some kind of road trip ensues during which a life altering realization is achieved.<br /><br />\\"An Abundance of Katherines\\" is no exception. Only this time the nerdy guy (Colin) is not that endearing (unlike Miles in \\"Looking For Alaska\\" or Quentin in \\"Paper Town\\"), the funny side-kick (Hassan) is not that funny, and the mysterious girl is not that mysterious or witty (compare Lindsey to Alaska and Margo). The 3rd person narration also doesn't help the cause. I think this kind of POV makes Colin unrelatable and exposes him for what he really is - a self-centered insecure super nerdy nerd whose head is full of theorems, anagrams, and numerous random facts. At some point you can't help but start thinking that if you were dating Colin, you'd break up with him just like all of his 19 ex-Katherines.<br /><br />In spite of all the flaws, the book is still moderately entertaining, the story picks up significantly in the end. And unlike \\"Looking For Alaska\\" and \\"Paper Towns\\" it has a satisfying happy (for a change) ending. \\"An Abundance of Katherines\\" is a decent read, just not as good as other John Green's books.
0893860220|5.0|This book holds a perfect and simple teaching from Maharaj. Presence is the key to enlightenment he says, and this is the main theme throughout the book. He is asked many many questions from various seekers of truth, and always he brings it all back down to living here in the moment. Some of the questions he is asked are really like a challenge to his basic answers, some of the questioners do not appear to like his simplicity of mind and thought, but he keeps trying to direct them away from complexity and take them back to Now.     This book gives a good idea of the various appraoches people are taking to the same goal and its ironic that the final step is the same for everyone - to surrender and let go into the moment!
B001GQSY64|5.0|I think some people were expecting a little too much from this movie. It was not written or directed by George Lucas. It is simply an introduction to the Cartoon Network series which in my opinion is even better than the movie. I really enjoyed the movie and my kids love it! We even bought the soundtrack! I like Anakin before he turned to the dark side so it is fun to watch more of him as a \\"good guy\\". We have both the Blu-ray and the standard DVD. I bought this copy simply to get the digital version for our iPod player. It was definitely worth the expense as the Blu-ray picture quality is just amazing to me!
B0013V33DG|2.0|I found the transition to more modern time and the set distracting. I also found the renditions of Regimental Rata-plan uninspired. I compare with Dame Sutherland's performance and memories of Beverly Sills' Wolftrap rendition.

B001EN71CW|2.0|The blu-ray version isn't a remaster. Others said it was an improvement, but I'm not getting the full HD experience I've come to expect. It's graining and I'm only on a 42\\" plasma. There are only a few extra features/commentaries that have been added. So, replacing my DVD set was a waste of money too my view.    If you are purchasing the series for the first time, you can go with the blu-ray for the little extra cost if you want. But if you own the DVD set, I wouldn't replace it for this and I'm not going to recommend you pay the extra for the Blu-ray at this point.
B002LL13BQ|5.0|I have this on vhs and have been waiting for this magnificent Zeffirelli production from the MET to be released on dvd.  Stratas and Carreras are wonderful.  28+ years later, the audience still applaud the set when the curtain goes up on Acts 2 and 3.  Bravo to all involved.
0385504225|2.0|The DaVinci code was a rewrite of angels and demons when A & D didn't originally sell.  Then when \\"code\\" went blockbuster, they went back and tweaked A & D and re-released it.  Now, they've done the same thing with the aptly named \\"Lost Symbol.\\"  Crazy bad guy with a bad complexion.  Code device that Langdon hauls around in his backpack until he can figure out how to unlock it. Hot chick he can't quite connect with.  \\"Surprise\\" bad guy.  \\"Mysterious pyramid\\" - aka The Washington Monument which if you didn't figure THAT out 10 pages in you're an idiot.  Secret societies chasing after each other and you don't know who the bad secret society is and who the good secret society is.  Maddening - and maddeningly inept -  cliffhangers to \\"drag\\" the reader along.  Did I just describe The DaVinci Code or Lost Symbol?  That's the point...it's the same damn book tweaked to sell 5 million more copies of the same damn book.  If you didn't have this book figured out by the time the mini-pyramid shows up, you deserve to lose the cash you dumped on this crapfest and on the cash you're no doubt going to dump on the movie, which is the real reason the book was written in the first place.  Ugh.

B002G4FQAC|4.0|I had never heard Paramore before, at least not that I am aware of, but for the first time in a long time I heard a song on the radio and knew immediately that I had to buy the CD.  Unfortunately I heard the single \\"Ignorance\\" a couple of months before the release, so I had to wait for the release of the album, but it was worth the wait.  Paramore is an indie rock band from Tennessee which was formed in 2004.  \\"Brand New Eyes\\" is Paramore's third album and was released on September 29th, 2009.    The album explodes with energy, drive, and powerful vocals, as the first two tracks \\"Careful\\" and \\"Ignorance\\" set a level which cannot be maintained, though the group certainly gives it a good try for the most part.  The third piece, \\"Playing God\\", drops off a bit, but not too far, and \\"Brick by Boring Brick\\" moves another notch closer to the quality of the opening pieces.  \\"Turn it Off\\" is a it more melodic, yet still has an underlying energy.  \\"The Only Exception\\" is a ballad, one where the singer confronts her fear of being in love when faced with the reality that she is in love.  A nice song, and it finishes off the first half of this album well.    \\"Feeling Sorry\\" starts off the second half of the album, and is a sign of the weaker nature of the second half.  This trend is continued with \\"Looking Up\\", and \\"Where the Lines Overlap\\".  In particular the transition from \\"Feeling Sorry\\" to \\"Looking Up\\" makes one feel like they are hearing the same song again, and that doesn't change until one is well into \\"Looking Up\\".  \\"Misguided Ghosts\\" is a bit better and at least offers a more distinct feel than the previous pieces, but still leaves something to be desired.  \\"All I Wanted\\" is a definite improvement to close the original album.  The CD I have includes a bonus track called \\"Decode\\".   This is a great track, as good as the first two pieces on the CD, and the CD really benefits from its inclusion.    Paramore is Hayley Williams (vocals), Josh Farro (guitar), Zac Farro (drums), Jeremy Davis (bass), and Taylor York (guitar).  Hayley Williams and Josh Farro do the majority of the songwriting, with some contributions from Taylor York as well.  A good portion of this album merits 5 stars, but there are some rather average pieces which bring the rating down to 4 stars for me.  Now that my ignorance is gone, I will have to seek out other albums from this group.

Dont miss it but be prepared to shed the tears if you have a heart that is.
1904633307|5.0|I recently read Jane Austen's Mansfield Park and thought it was a little disappointing and full of annoying characters. Pride & Prejudice will always be my favorite, but I found Northanger Abbey superior to almost all of Jane Austen's novels, except P&P and Persuasion.    In this novel, seventeen year old Catherine Morland is invited to visit Bath with her neighbors, the wealthy Mr and Mrs Allen. Catherine is eager to attend balls and be introduced to society. In Bath Catherine makes friends with Isabella Thorpe, who is very quick to befriend Catherine and can hardly bear to be separated from her new friend. Isabella's brother, John Thorpe, always goes out of his way to befriend Catherine and press the friendship between Catherine and Isabella.    Trouble brews when Catherine meets Henry and Eleanor Tilney, the children of a wealthy and distinguished General. Catherine is immediately attracted to Henry and desperately hopes to further their friendship, especially by befriending his sister, Eleanor. There is a glitch in Catherine's plan, her friend, Miss Thorpe tries, to discourage the friendship and with the assistance of her brother, goes out of her way to sabotage the friendship between Catherine and the Tilneys.    The name of the novel, Northanger Abbey, refers to the Tilney home, where Catherine is invited to join her new friends. Catherine, who is an avid reader of Gothic novels, is in awe of all the history and possible mysteries lurking in the historic abbey. Catherine's love of Gothic novels, especially The Mysteries of Udolpho by Ann Radcliffe, convince her that something mysterious occured at Northanger Abbey. When Catherine sees the General behave in a strange manner when his deceased wife is mentioned, and when he suddenly appears just as Eleanor is about to show Catherine Mrs Tilney's former bedroom, Catherine convinces herself that something is amiss. Perhaps the General murdered his wife or worse, perhaps she is imprisoned somewhere in the abbey!Northanger Abbey is a parody of the Gothic novel. Catherine is so busy imaging the murder or imprisonment of Mrs Tilney, that she doesn't realize the joke is on her! Some people may not think that Northanger Abbey is Austen's best novel, but I thought it was absolutely charming and amusing. Definitely Jane Austen's best lighthearted novel.
B00185EENU|5.0|Solid movie. Shows that good movies come from anywhere but america. Suspense, betrayals, love, politics, and a cold war. Moving, well acted, superb cinematography, just a perfect movie. Won best picture for foreign film, and would at least gotten a nom if the academy treated foreign film as equals. See it and see it again...
0143034901|2.0|Initially, the words hooked me. The translation is a pleasure to read, and so I imagine credit belongs to Lucia Graves. But the story is lacking for me. The focus is all on forbidden love, TV soap-opera style -- completely forgettable and a waste of time by the end.
B001NY4X4G|4.0|To be totally honest, this is a very much by-the-numbers legal thriller. Richard Gere, Laura Linney, Alfre Woodard, Frances McDormand, Steven Bauer, John Mahoney and Andre Braugher all put in fine performances. The film has good moments of suspense and drama, and Gregory Hoblit directs the film with a modicum of passion and intensity. When all is said and done, this is a pretty unremarkable film...<br /><br />...and then you have Edward Norton.<br /><br />Edward Norton's ingenious performance is what elevates this film above and beyond a great many other legal thrillers. This being the first of many great performances to come from Norton, he brings a lovability, gullibility, quiet menace and unbridled fury to a role that could have easily been portrayed in a very TV-movie kind of way by a lesser performer. When he's on screen, the quality of the performers around him turns the dial up to eleven. He gives the role of Aaron Stampler a life of its own, and he's really the only actor in the film that you can sense isn't just pantomiming a character stereotype. Gere is the flashy, selfish, self-absorbed defense attorney; Linney is the cold-as-ice, tough-as-nails prosecutor; McDormand is the intelligent, maternal psychologist; Woodard is a tough-but-fair judge; Bauer plays essentially the same role he played in SCARFACE... anyway, you get the idea.<br /><br />It's essentially a film that, if it had lacked Norton, would be maybe a 2-star movie at best, even with the shock ending. But because Norton is such a naturally gifted performer and the way that he sells the character and the shock ending is what elevates this film to a highly recommended 4-star film.<br /><br />Also, bear in mind, Cuba Gooding Jr. for JERRY MAGUIRE beat Norton for the Best Supporting Actor Oscar in 1996. What is Cuba Gooding Jr. doing now? After a string of embarassingly awful features, he's done nothing but Direct-to-DVD films and bad television shows. Norton... he's committed some of the most amazing performances to film since then and is still not recognized by the Academy.<br /><br />Just another example of how frighteningly wrong the Academy can be.ce then and is still not recognized by the Academy.     Just another example of how frighteningly wrong the Academy can be.
B002BSHXJA|5.0|Great recordings, with all the great sound for the number one band in rock history.  Awesome presentation in mini LP format, made in Japan. If you love music, if you love Beatles you will love this set.  It deserves a special place in your collection

0312370849|5.0|This book far exceeded my expectations; it was not depressing; it was an original story of a familiar part of history; the characters were excellently drawn.  I recommend it to everyone.
0446679089|1.0|It seems this book has taken me soooo long to read - it just never picks up speed.  It's one of those books that never seems to grab your attention.  Too much description - too many wise cracks - too much information about pirates.  IT DRAGS ON FOREVER...
0385504225|1.0|I've liked \\"Deception Point\\", and \\"Angels and Daemons\\".  They are packed with action, twists and grandiose action. I've been more tedious with the \\"Da Vinci Code\\", a pale mapping of \\"Holy Grail, Holly Blood\\" to a kind of action thriller (I still do not understand how this book had been so successful, while \\"Angels and Daemons\\" is quite better..). Now let's go to the \\"Lost Symbol\\". The truth is that I had some difficulty to finish reading this book ,so much I've found it boring. Nothing to thrill about, all revelations guessed by any reader hundred pages before, no real grandiose action, and an end based on metaphysical gibberish about man being unknowingly God. I've lost 24 euros by pre-ordering this book from the US to France several months ago! Disappointing, to say the least...
0385510454|2.0|I have not read the books that made Grisham famous. In fact this is the first full-length book of his I have read. In short, I do not find the book compelling. This is John Grisham's first spy novel and it has received mostly positive reviews, with which I do not agree. Washington power broker Joel Backman, who holds the secret to a sophisticated spy satellite system, is on the run for his life and at least 4 countries and the CIA want him dead. The first half of the book details Backman's two months hiding in Italy. This part moves at a very languid pace and about all you get out of it is an extensive Italian language lesson and an in depth of tour of the city of Bologna. The second half of the book moves faster, but peters out to a disappointing finish. You feel the author is just trying to quickly finish the book and put the reader out of his misery. If you want to read Grisham, I recommend you stick to Grisham's legal thrillers.
1416955070|5.0|I enjoyed City Of Bones. I am well out of the intended age range for the book(38) but it was a lot of fun to read-I wouldn't mind having Simon as a best friend. There are lots of twists and turns in the book-and at least one that even I, as a fairly clued in person, was surprised by.
0312853238|5.0|We actually listened to the CD version of the book (unabridged) during a Denver to Mount Rushmore trip.  The miles flew by.  We couldn't wait to get back in the car to see what Ender was up to next.  We all loved this book!  My 11 and 15 year-old boys did not fight once.  This is a miracle.  My husband loved it and I loved it and we are in our late 40's and early 50's.     There is just something universally appealing about a 6-year-old boy being chosen and trained to save the world.     We are leaving for another long car trip in a couple of weeks and we can't decide which Ender novel to listen to next--Speaker of the Dead or the Shadow Series.  We may need them both.  Maybe we will forget the condo and the Grand Canyon and just listen to Ender stories.  Who needs DVD players in your car when you have a CD player and Orson Scott Card?
B000MNP2KI|5.0|Daniel Craig portrays James Bond in a modern spy movie.  Excellent acting in this film.  The female \\"Que\\" fits in very well.  Just an excellent Bond movie.
B002KDUDG6|3.0|Buble has a lovely voice and covers a range of pop standards.  I think he does best when the orchestration is more minimal -- sometimes, it's overly lush and threatens to overwhelm his vocals.  On ballads with a piano and bass, it's easy listening, in the best sense of those words.
B002KDUDG6|5.0|PERFECTION!!  Michael Buble does it again with this stunning collection of standards and newly written future hits!  I've waited 2 1/2 years for his next CD, and this does not disappointment!  Now I'll wait for the next one while I play this one over-and-over again!  All smiles here!!
B00003CX8Y|5.0|For me, \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" is the best Disney film, and it is my favorite.  \\"Wall-E\\" is right up there for me, but for simple animation, it will always be \\"Beauty and the Beast.\\"  I love how Disney has taken some of the most simple stories and made them so palpable for both children and adults.  Such life-lessons include, dealing with the loss of a parent, learning to be yourself, and the most profound of all, for me: seeing the beauty of yourself and others from the inside.<br /><br />While these may seem like simple morality tales, I venture that most people would find such obstacles extremely challenging.  This is one reason why Disney films, such as this one, can easily be viewed over and over again, because like reading a good spiritual book, the lessons are always applicable.<br /><br />The movie sets the tone from the start, with David Ogden Stiers as the narrator, using that great voice of his, to give us the prologue of the story; that a young prince has been transformed into a beast due to his lack of love and insight.<br /><br />Beauty and the Beast has one of the best heroines, in my opinion, in Disney animation.  Belle (brilliantly voiced by Paige O'Hara) is a simple girl from a small town.  She goes against the norm for the other young women of the town, because she loves to read, and she is not afraid to speak her mind.  These are several personality traits that frequently frustrate the town's handsome suitor, Gaston; a person who all of the other young women find absolutely appealing, but for Belle, Gaston is the antithesis of the qualities she looks for in a man.  Belle is pure-hearted, and she is looking for someone who shares the same qualities.  She isn't necessarily picky.  She simply knows what she wants, and strangely enough, she finds him in the most unlikely of guises.<br /><br />*You'll note that one of interesting ways that the animators make Belle stand out, is that she is the only person in town wearing blue.<br /><br />The Beast is a man consumed with anger and self-loathment.  He can't even stand to look at how he used to be, as we see him rip a portrait of himself to pieces.  The first meeting between Belle and the Beast is not a happy one at all.  The Beast is unable to see his own cruelty (perhaps because this is how he has always been, and he doesn't know how to be any different) as he drags Belle's father away from her, not even thinking about her feelings at all.<br /><br />Belle is able to soften the Beast, as she is able to keep up with him and his own sense of logic, which is beautifully demonstrated as the two argue back and forth after the wolf attack.  Ironically, it often takes someone else to show us what others see.  I find it interesting that the Beast's only link to the outside world is a mirror, since the mirror is his greatest asset to remind him to look within himself.  In many ways, Belle is the Beast's true mirror.  She finally begins to see something hidden beneath the anger and despair, and she helps him to see what she already sees.<br /><br />The dance sequence across the ballroom floor is probably my favorite scene.  The attention to detail by the animation department is incredible...from shadows to reflections, to the embroidery of the marble pillars, and the detail of the tapestries.  This is also the climactic scene in which is becomes apparent that both Belle and the Beast love each other.  Both the animation and lighting are at their pinnacle peak during this sequence.  There is such attention to detail.  I love the way Belle is continuously moving a strand of hair from her face.<br /><br />Beast demonstrates his love for Belle in the purest and noblest of ways: he lets her go.  We have all heard about how if you truly someone, you must let it go.  Love is to be given, and the Beast, despite his feelings, lets Belle go to find and be with her ill father.<br /><br />There is a host of terrific characters in this film.  Gaston epitomizes the conceited, manly manwho thinks of no one but himself.  I like Gaston's character because he isn't the \\"evil prototype\\" that we've seen in the past.  He's simply a man whose ego is larger than life, and he will never risk losing out to anyone, let alone a hairy Beast!<br /><br />Jerry Orbach is terrific as Lumiere, and provides one of the best songs in the film, \\"Be Our Guest\\" in which every item in the kitchen is involved in an elaborate musical and dance number, with little reminders of the follies done during the 20s and 30s.<br /><br />Angela Lansbury is perfectly cast as the teapot, Mrs. Potts, playing the proverbial, wise housekeeper.<br /><br />Overall, the film has true charm, and anyone of any age will enjoy it.  Beauty and the Beast is a timeless classic, and the only animated film to ever be nominated for Best Picture.  The film was even converted into a Broadway show that was an instant hit.<br /><br />Beauty and the Beast teaches us to leave our prejudicial judgments at the door.  It is often challenging to look within ourselves and others to see the true beauty that lies within each one of us.  Aside from being an exquisite romantic film, Beauty and the Beast serves as a reminder that there is beauty in everyone.

The latest CD by this foursome is quite the surprise, it is a flashback to the seventies with a bit of eighties thrown in for color. What is given here is one outstanding recording that you will love!  A must have for the fall season.

B000J5NXLY|4.0|I bought this for my 20-year old daughter for here college photography class. She had been using a borrowed digit light meter and I was worried she would have problems adjusting to dials and needles. I purchased the Sekonic l-208 as it was half the price of a digital meter. She tried the two meters side by side and they reported the same results, at which I breathed a sigh of relief.<br /><br />No major pros or cons to report right now. The optional bracket to attach the device to the camera hotshoe is a nice feature. The L-208 is all plastic, which was a bit of a surprise, but probably should not have been. I think I was harking back to the old kind of meter that was all metal. The L-208 takes a replaceable mercury  battery.
0307454541|5.0|This book is a great page-turner which leaves you begging for more. Reading this thriller is made  more poignant knowing Stieg Larsson won't be writing more mysteries. You can't put the book down; you want to know how it ends but closing the book leaves a void that cannot be filled.
0920668364|5.0|What sold me the most on purchasing this book was other peoples comments.  The book is wonderfully written and very heart warming.  I have 2 sons, both of which I saw in reading this book.  It is so easy to get caught up in every day mundane activities.  But time spent with your children is the most rewarding activity in the world.  Reading this book together as a family with both parents and all children in the household will be a blessing to all.  And time very well spent.  I am giving this book to my son who has a son.  Oh the benefits that will be reaped...
B002GZQY6Q|5.0|Steven Wilson has outdone himself again!    I purchased this CD in anticipation of actually seeing Porcupine Tree in Boston on September 27th, figuring that they would be performing it in whole or in part at the show, and wanting to be familiar with the music for the event. My first thought on the first run through was how seamless it was.....one song segued into the next, and it wasn't always easy to tell where one ended and the next one began. My next thought was, where is the \\"hit\\"? It didn't take me long to decide that it is \\"Time Flies\\"....a poignant song, as so many of Steven Wilson's songs are, with a tempo that really gives the feeling of how fast time really does fly. For me there are several other stand outs on the CD.... most notably \\"Your Unpleasant Family\\" which makes me smile every time I hear it, not just for the lyrics, but for the unmistakable chord progressions and ethereal vocals that scream \\"Porcupine Tree\\". The other song that I especially love is the last cut on the first disc....\\"I Drive the Hearse\\"...but there is no sub par song on this CD...they are all amazing.     I truly immersed myself in \\"The Incident\\" for a solid week, then went to Boston and saw them perform that entire first disc flawlessly. To my delight, everyone in my immediate vicinity was singing along with it just as I was! The more I listen to it, the more I can say it holds up well against some of their previous jewels which are all masterpieces of progressive rock.
0099513757|5.0|\\"The Code of the Woosters\\" by P.G. Wodehouse is a riotous romp through an English country manor that sees that poor protagonist, Bertie Wooster, the center of attentions he least desires.  The title refers to the fact that a Wooster will always help a friend, even to his own detriment and possible imprisonment.  \\"The Code of the Woosters\\" is a laugh-out-loud rambling story full of canceled engagements, thievery, and the brillance of Jeeves.<br /><br />Bertie Wooster's troubles begin when his friend Gussie Fink-Nottle fears that his engagement to Madeline Basset (a previous fiance of Bertie's) has been irreparably damaged.  He asks Bertie to visit them at Madeline's house, a trip that Bertie loathes to take, for he has had a previous run-in with Madeline's father, a magistrate, over a prank snatching that occured in his younger days.  Bertie's Aunt Dahlia is thrilled that her nephew will be at Totleigh Towers, for she wants him to snatch an antique silver cow creamer that Basset bought from under her husband's nose.  Bertie doesn't want to follow through on his aunt's wishes, but his host has already fingered him as a crook when the cow creamer indeed goes missing, along with a local police officer's helmet, the same \\"crime\\" Bertie committed in his youth.  It doesn't help Bertie's state of mind when his friend's engagement is in a constant state of flux and the girl might be intending to marry him instead.  Only Jeeves can come up with a satisfactory solution to all the problems facing his master.<br /><br />\\"The Code of the Woosters\\" is as convoluted a plot as Wodehouse ever created.  Just when Bertie believes one obstacle to be overcome, another graver misfortune takes its place.  The solution is humorously satisfying and well worth the rambling road it takes to get there.

0385504225|4.0|There is something immensely entertaining about conspiracy theories. To come up with an utterly ludicrous premise, and use real facts, documents, and artefacts to support it so well that the reader can suspend disbelief for a few hours is a challenging task, and it's something Dan Brown is really good at.<br /><br />In his previous books, Dan Brown made his task a little easier by choosing cities that are thousands of years old for his locations. Cities like Paris and Rome have a rich history, and a lot of that history is veiled in myths, which gave Brown a lot of room to manoeuvre in. For his new book, Brown set a much tougher challenge for himself by choosing a relatively young city (Washington DC) as a location. Brown did surprisingly well with his new backdrop. He found plenty of clues for his story, and the book is a treasure of historical and cultural trivia. This aspect of the book I found immensely entertaining.<br /><br />But Washington DC is also the main weakness of the book: there is no way Brown could construct a gripping conclusion for the story that could match The Da Vinci Code, and as a result The Lost Symbol ends with a total anticlimax. Not only that, actions that seemed plausible throughout the book suddenly become inexplicable in the light of the conclusion. This book deserved a better ending.<br /><br />Dan Brown's books are so formulaic that it is starting to affect their quality. More than once Brown had to cheat a little to conceal his tricks because they are getting too predictable. Imagination is not Brown's forte, and he should think about teaming up with a more creative mind for future books.<br /><br />The characters: Now that Robert Langdon, the main character of several novels, is closer to home, we get to meet some of his friends. It gives Langdon a little more personal involvement in the story, but anyone looking for emotional depth is advised to look elsewhere. Brown put most of his energy developing the villain, and this is where Brown trumped his previous creations. This person is scarier than Silas or the Hassassin, and Brown gives him plenty of opportunity to show his skills.<br /><br />Brown talks a lot about religion and science in this book, and I wish he hadn't. This prose can only be described as wishful thinking, and bears very little relationship with real science. A huge opportunity was missed here. Washington DC is a great place for anyone interested in real science, but this is very poorly represented in this book.<br /><br />Brown's literary style has been severely criticised by the more pedantic among his readership. Frankly, I don't care. Like his other books, this book is written well enough to keep you going, and that's all you really should expect from a fast-paced book like this. Overall, if you're interested in an adventure with a rich context and lots of tidbits of historical and cultural information, this book is well worth the read.tions.

1579126235|5.0|is one of my favorite books in the world. I remember when I was a child, I would sneak out of my room and turn on the living room television after my mother went to bed and stay up late watching old movies on TCM. My favorite nights were when Murder On The Orient Express, starring Lauren Bacall, Albert Finney, Vanessa Redgrave, Sean Connery, and a dozen other Old Hollywood stars that I just loved. Years later, when I discovered my love of literature, the first author that I indulged myself in was Agatha Christie.<br /><br />Murder On The Orient Express is everything a guilty pleasure novel should be. Quick, interesting, easy to understand, and keeps you devouring every single word until the last page. I absolutely love the character of Poirot, love the supporting characters, and find the Armstrong case more and more heart-breaking every time I read it. You will read this novel and you will love every word of it!
0451196716|5.0|I love this book!  It's different than anything else I've ever read and I think King does a great job with the characterization and making us feel what the characters are feeling.  This is probably my favorite Stephen King.

B002KDUDG6|5.0|I'm surprised at the reviews for this CD!     First off, if people would have read the background for the making of this CD, they would understand it better. Michael wanted to get the same feeling with this CD as the older recordings had from his idols...by doing it live. The recordings done in studio now are cut in sections and then all put together with modern technology. He wanted the flaws in recording live make this CD come to life and give people an \\"organic\\" (Michael's term) feeling. His goal was to have the horns blend with the drums and the vocals so people could feel like they were sitting in the studio while he was recording this.     Poor song selections? The title of this CD is about the ups and downs of how crazy love can be. He chose songs that he could relate to from broken relationships. He did them in typical Bublé style....with lots of feeling. The instrumentals can be very dramatic at times, but it gives it all the more of what Michael was feeling while recording this CD.    This CD may be very different from previous CD's with a mellower Bublé, but it indeed is still excellent! Cry Me A River has a very dramatic beginning, but I am willing to bet this song is going to be his opening song at his concerts when his tour starts! I love the songs on this CD!     Just Haven't Met You Yet is so upbeat and hopeful, Hold On is absolutely beautiful, Crazy Love is tied at the top for being one of my favorites, At This Moment another top favorite, Stardust, Georgia On My Mind....they are all just so good. Whatever It Takes is such a great duo that's going to be a favorite of many!     The more I hear this CD the more I love it! Definitely another winner for me!
0807126063|5.0|What a truly brilliant piece of literature this is. Ignatius J Reilly is an original, head-scratching, mind bending character that brings this turn paging story to life. After reading a few boring books, this novel was a breath of fresh air, as I've never come across anything like it. The style of writing is reminiscent of a few other writers I've encountered, most probably heavilly influenced by this book, but the story and characters that surround Ignatius are brilliantly interwoven to a conclusion that somehow makes sense. This story easilly could have drifted into nihilistic ramblings, much like a Brett Easton Ellis book, but thankfully this author is much more talented and clever.     If you are looking for something that is delightfully fresh, check this novel out.
B00004RJEG|5.0|The Coors are a very good family group. They mix original Irish rock tunes, traditional celtic sounds and make you appreciate rock standards with the Corr's  touch. A big thumbs up !!
1400030293|5.0|It's not the duel with psychiatry that makes this book great. It was banned for explicit sex in England (apparently, it was that unusual) in the 1960s. But it's Templeton's amazing writing technique that's truly eye-opening. The opening scene is the fastest, most furious, and funniest that has ever hooked me into a book.
B000MKXEME|5.0|Probably one of the most horrifying movies in recent memory, it is also one that has it's audience laughing uncontrollably. A combination of grotesque and camp, the serious questions it raises are buried under an avalanche of hilarity and gore. Herbert West, a medical scientist, arrives at the Miskatonic Medical School to continue his research into bringing the dead back to life. With his glowing green serum, and his talking a fellow student into assisting him, he proceeds to disrupt the school. There is nudity and worse in the ensuing melee. The 2 DVD set includes a 70-minute featurette plus many other bonus material. For the mature-minded.
B001EHDWNK|2.0|Amazingly, the television series created from this book is infinitely better. The idea of a flashforward is intriguing, but the long winded technical explainations from Sawyer and the persistent whinging from his characters suck the life out of the book.     On the other hand, the TV Series shortened the timeline to six months jump forward (much more interesting than 20 years), added mystery and suspense with a nefarious group behind the event, and abandoned the whinging characters for more likeable folk.
B0025KVLTW|5.0|It's hard to say why I'm rating this with 5-stars also.  Even though my hope and anticipation - key anticipation - was that \\"I'm the Walrus\\" was to receive the type of dynamic work that was demonstrated in the hybrid \\"Tomorrow Never Knows/Within You Without You\\" from the \\"Love\\" package release, of a couple of years ago.  I guess, even with that annoying minute or so of mono in this song, the cleanup work on \\"Walrus\\" and the rest of the package is enough to keep a fan like me satisfied.  I think the reason for that is that the bad-[...] groove of the track is just too powerful and undeniably good.  I know that Geoff Emerick thinks of this song as more or less fluff nonsense rhymes, but as far as I'm concerned the groove and the vagueness of the lyrical imagery is valid and strong enough - just like \\"Sexyback,\\" which should be a nothing of a song, but if you're not moved by the power of its funk and groove, you might just be pulse-less.  And like other reviewers have pointed out, in the US, Capitol records usually made a horrid mess of issuing album versions of Beatles product.  But in the case of \\"Magical Mystery Tour\\" the cosmic forces of song, drug culture euphoria, \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" type weirdness, and actual songwriting brilliance, the American label hit on a happy accident of fate, force, and fab.  It is an awesome collection of songs, and recording experimentations.  The bonus documentary however, is only for the younger, newer fans, which might be barely discovering the Beatles.  Older fanatics like me, will be acquainted with the documentary material, inside and out, backward and forward, over, under, sideways, down, and any other which way by now.
B0029XFNA8|1.0|Happy to have it in BLU-RAY format BUT whoever put this together did a really bad job as the other reviewers have already expressed.  It also has less content than the two disc DVD set that came out a few years ago...it is missing things like the TV show version, etc.  If you are going to reissue as a BLU-RAY....you do not take content away.  It does say in the paragraph on the back that it has the color version as well BUT it does not.  I too like the black and white version better BUT what moron left the color version off?  I am going to call the # on the back of the DVD and report their errors.
B0025KVLTM|5.0|I rated this remastered version 5-stars, even though it doesn't quite match the excitement of hearing the remastered \\"Yellow Submarine\\" Beatles' songs version of the movie soundtrack, or the aural assault that occurred in portions of the \\"Love\\" sucker soil eel...er, whatever (I'm sorry, I'm just not a fan of the musicals unless they're very, very good).<br />Still, I suppose because I'm a Beatles die-hard fan (have been for ever, and will be till I die, I'm sure), I gobbled up every enhancement, and instance of cleanup that came with this issue.  This is especially great for beginning musicians that are also Beatles fans, because the clarity afforded in this disc makes it much easier to learn the songs bit by bit.  Somehow, I believe, that just as in the first issue of the Beatles music on CD, what pops out the most is the bass guitar sound.  This may not establish Paul as a virtuoso, but he is one of the true stylists of the instrument, and plays about as melodic bass-wise as anyone else in rock or any other genre.<br />As a \\"concept\\" album, it seems more and more tongue-in-cheek as time passes, but the moments of brilliance nevertheless shine thru.  The greatest moment in the collection is probably crescendo climax and E chord smash of the opus known as \\"A Day in the Life.\\"  Ever a \\"rock\\" fan, I also enjoyed the excitement and pounding pulsing rhythms of both \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\\" and its reprise.<br />The music of Sgt. Pepper was once called psycadelic, but the only real psycadelic offerings are \\"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\\" and \\"Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite,\\" both of which are a sonic delight (especially in this remastered work), the likes of which allow me to \\"trip\\" without actually ingesting any chemicals or other mind altering substances.<br />I have no idea what processes and amount of tinkering George and Gyles Martin did with the Beatles' songs on the Love project, but hopefully in the not too distant future, most or all of the Beatles recordings will receive a treatment that truly fulfils the potential that was explored by the original producer and his son.  Until then, this package is the only version of \\"Pepper\\" I will listen to from now on.will receive a treatment that truly fulfils the potential that was explored by the original producer and his son.

0743297334|5.0|The Sun Also Rises is Hemingway's second novel but his first masterpiece. It centers around the relationship between Jake Barnes and Britt Ashley who fell in love during WWI when Jake was a wounded soldier and Britt a nurse who was assigned to him. Brii wants both good sex and deep emotional companionship. Jake wounded in his genitals is sexually impotent but is the only man who can give Britt what she wants emotionally so Britt is constantly infatuated with men has sex with them and then drops them once the sex no longer satisfies. There is a lot of empty behavior in the novel. The title comes form a passage from The Bible specifically Ecclesisates and one must realize the novel is not so much about a group of American and British expatriates as a commentary on the vanity of life. A great novel which I recommend wholeheartedly
B0024F08RO|5.0|Season 4 of Prison Break is just as exciting as its first season. Watching this series end is like having to say a very sad goodbye to an old friend that you will never see again. What killed this great show? Probably the combination of writing errors and the ratings war. It is such a shame that we cannot have another 4 years of great plotting and watching the characters that have become so meaningful to us.    Be advised that season 4 takes the series out of the realm of prison and into the realm of technology and quick innovation through a team context. It is more similar to watching episodes of Mission Impossible than it is to watching hunted convicts. Could some events have been handled better? Maybe so, but this is fiction, not the re-enactment of real life events.    The first half of the season is quite thrilling. It sets up the viewer for the conflicts to be resolved during the remaining episodes. Tension continues to build with each episode. In the end everything gets resolved. There are many surprises, twists, and turns along the way. You will love the suspense and the dramatic rescues.    Prison Break ends in very good way yet with a sad final scene. I will not spoil the ending for you. However, in the final scene it is made clear to the viewer that there is no coming back from the dead this time. Fans will remember Prison Break as one of the best shows ever produced. I hope you enjoy watching it as much as I did. I wish the show could have gone on forever!

B0025KVLT2|5.0|I'll admit it ... I'm a lifelong Beatle's fan.  I'm the one they're selling these re-mastered records to.  I'm an easy mark.  But I'm also a pro-musician and can appreciate the quality of these records.  The Beatles, George Martin and their engineers did a great job of recording these songs back in the 1960's and it's wonderful to hear them in all their glory.  I own the entire collection but Rubber Soul and Revolver were always my favorite records of The Beatles.  The Word, Michelle, In My Life, Girl, etc., never sounded so good.  If you own a good set of headphones, do yourself a sonic favor and listen to these records in that environment.

B002GZQYMK|2.0|I've been a Muse fan since Absolution. Their music is incredible, and listening to them grow and get better on every album blows my mind. This album, however, is several steps backward for them. The album as a whole just seems like a lot of uninspired wankery that goes nowhere from a band that is capable of so much more.<br /><br />The album's bright spots are the first single \\"Uprising\\" and \\"Unnatural Selection.\\" The latter is easily the best song on the album, and is the Muse that I was expecting to show up on this album. \\"Uprising\\" sounds like it could've been a song on Black Holes and Revelations, however even though it is one of the best songs on this album, it would be in the lower half of Black Holes. That's not to say that \\"Uprising\\" is a bad song, but it says how superior of an album Black Holes is compared to this one.<br /><br />\\"Resistance\\" and \\"MK Ultra\\" are also strong songs in their own right.<br /><br />\\"Undisclosed Desires\\" sounds more like a song by an overproduced boy band than a rock band. \\"United States of Eurasia\\" sounds like a Queen song that I would skip past to get to their better material. \\"Guiding Light\\" is not a bad song, but does not really go anywhere. It is the kind of song that would be better if the material around it was better; if it was a part of something greater... unfortunately, it's not. \\"I Belong to You\\" almost sounds like it could be in the credits of a Disney movie, but doesn't sound like it belongs on a Muse record.<br /><br />This brings me to the Exogenesis trilogy. When I read several months ago that Bellamy and company were working on a three-song symphonic suite, it made my pants a little wet. When I picked up the album, and was disappointed overall with the first 8 songs, I kept telling myself that the last three were what I was really waiting for. Unfortunately, that ending trilogy was just more of the same with this album. Part 1 is interesting musically, and would make a great intro to the suite if the rest of it was any good. Parts 2 and 3, however, are let-downs. Again, the music seems to build but not go anywhere.<br /><br />Overall, a very poor effort from Muse. What makes it worse is that in my opinion, they explored new ground and got better with every release, then made a drastic turnaround with this effort. If you are just getting into Muse, do yourself a favor and go buy Absolution or Black Holes and Revelations and leave this one on the shelf. If you want some exciting new progressive music, go pick up the newest Porcupine Tree album.was any good. Parts 2 and 3, however, are let-downs.

B000NQRE0K|1.0|There is no doubt this is an excellent film. 7 Academy Awards good. But, this blu-ray disk is an insult to the film itself.<br />Neither the film nor sound is enhanced to fully utilize the depth and capacity of blu-ray.  You're better off just watching your old regular dvd of Braveheart on a quality DVD player.  What a shame.  Sorry I bought this blu-ray.  Hey! Paramount! How can<br />a puff-ball sci-fi film like 'The Last Starfighter' get to be beautifully enhanced for blu-ray with excellent sound but a<br />multiple Academy Award winner doesn't deserve the same? And, then, to market this low ball edition as something special<br />called 'Sapphire Series'??? I guess Sapphire Series means \\"we didn't want to spend the money on enhancing the film for blu-ray\\". Tragic.

0545123267|4.0|A good love story is always a hit in the Young Adult genre with avid teenage readers.  A love story with a supernatural twist is even more so.  \\"Shiver\\" boasts this and then some, offering up a Romeo and Juliet-esque ill-fated romance, some new and interesting concepts on werewolves, generous doses of danger and intrigue and a young author who writes it all with panache.  Welcome to the fantastical imagination of Maggie Stiefvater - sit down with her and dream awhile.<br /><br />The novel opens with a young girl named Grace lying in the snow surrounded by a pack of wolves intent on killing her.  One wolf finds her beautiful, wants to save her, Grace somehow sensing she will owe her survival to it: \\"I wanted to reach out and grab a hold of his ruff, but my hands stayed curled on my chest, my arms frozen to my body.  I couldn't remember what it felt like to be warm...There was no sun; there was no light.  I was dying.  I couldn't remember what the sky looked like.  But I didn't die.  I was lost to a sea of cold, and then I was reborn into a world of warmth.  I remember this: his yellow eyes.  I thought I'd never see them again.\\" (pgs. 1, 2)<br /><br />Fast forward several years, another summer coming to an end, and those same hypnotizing yellow eyes are watching Grace from behind the register in a local bookstore, their gaze originating from a young man named Sam.  Sam is a werewolf, bitten as a boy, and his time as a human is growing increasingly short.  His change from man to beast dependent on the seasons (the cold/winter is what causes his transformation to a wolf), he knows he has but one season left before he becomes a wolf for good.  Though she knows not of Sam the Boy, Grace still feels a connection to Sam the Wolf, the lovelorn lycanthrope having stood sentry at the edge of her yard for many winters since she was attacked by his pack.  Once they meet, they fall in love quickly but much threatens their relationship. Desperate to keep him in his human form, Grace houses him in her bedroom and keeps the heater cranked in her Bronco as the mercury on the outdoor thermometer steadily declines in the wake of a merciless Minnesota winter.  Making matters worse is a jealous member of Sam's pack named Shelby, a girl with an alpha female frame of mind who relishes the lupine within her and wants Sam as her alpha male.  Also a peril is a newborn werewolf named Jack Culpepper, a local teen well known for his hotheadedness.  As a wolf he is more dangerous than ever and presumed dead by the townspeople after the pack attacks him, he now roams the town erratically, unable to control his temper, leaving corpses as well as new werewolves in his wake.<br /><br />Author Maggie Stiefvater (who has been making a living as a novelist, musician and artist since she was 22) has said of Shiver that \\"it's the first unabashedly romantic novel that I've written, where the whole point of it is the love story...it's happy, and sad, and bittersweet and I'm really proud of it. While I was writing it, it was just for me, but the further along I got, the more I thought...something is happening here. By the time I got to the end, I was pretty much crawling out of my skin with excitement, thinking it was a huge jump forward for me in character-building in particular.  It was definitely helped out by the end of the Twilight series and people looking for another paranormal teen romance.\\"<br /><br />Stiefvater switches perspectives between Grace and Sam, heading each chapter with whom is speaking as well as the current temperature (which predictably drops as the book goes on); one can almost feel the cold she describes as the last of autumn's leaves give way to snowfall.  Chapters are brief and end in a cliffhanger style, encouraging the reader to keep going until they reach the book's conclusion.  Plot is simple and thorough and, being a novel from the Young Adult category, is easy to read.  She possesses a style that is nearly every bit as enthralling as her more notable competition (Stephenie Meyer), though some of the romance is a bit maudlin and/or nauseating.  I had to remind myself that she was writing about young love, something that can be every bit as eye-rolling as it is fantastical.<br /><br />Shiver is Book One of a three-book series entitled \\"The Wolves of Mercy Falls\\"; to very little surprise, it has made the New York Times Bestseller List and its much-anticipated sequel (\\"Linger\\") will be published next August. The film rights for all three books were picked up at the end of September, so it will be interesting to see who is cast in the roles of Sam and Grace.<br /><br />Bottom line: Readers young and old, if you love a good paranormal romance, Shiver will undoubtedly be described by those of you who pick it up as a \\"page-turner\\".  Stiefvater is an author on the rise whose well of creativity won't dry out anytime soon.<br /><br />[...](Stephenie Meyer), though some of the romance is a bit maudlin and/or nauseating.

B002BSHWUU|5.0|Enough has been said about the program material.  This is the Beatles, and everyone knows the quality of the music.  The big issue here is, of course, the sound.  Indeed, there are many details which could not be heard on the '87 discs but are clear here.  The bass is actually there this time, and comes through with great detail, revealing how good a bass player Paul is.  The mids are clear and the treble bright, much brighter than on the older discs, which sound dull by comparison.  Let's face it, no-one is going to make these recordings sound like they were recorded today, and the stereo on the earliest discs, which was contrived from tapes which were never designed for stereo in the first place, is artificial at best.  But considering what the engineers had to work with, the job they did is a revelation.  True, the early LP pressings are still better; however, within the limitations of both the source material and the CD medium, these discs surely represent the maximum fidelity available with today's technology.  An unqualified success.
0740785508|5.0|My passion has always been illustration. I studied it in college at top schools and continue to work and study illustration and art in general and have worked in the graphics field for over 20 years.     I WISH I HAD HAD THIS BOOK IN COLLEGE!!!!    This book is detailed and succinct and what every aspiring illustrator, nay, artist who wishes to work in a realist manner should have in their library. James Gurney is an incredible role model! This book should become a standard textbook!    I could go on and on and on about all the things that blew me away and how much I learned from this book. One that sticks in my mind is how James approached a Fireman and asked him his opinion on a fire fighting dinosaur design - the collaboration was utterly inspiring and reminds me what is it we artists do:    We COMMUNICATE - we CONNECT - we CHERISH all the details of human life and the world around us.     James Gurney has given us the handbook on how to do that.    Thank you Mr. Gurney!

I tried to like it, listened to it everyday for 2 weeks, and the songs still just mushed together into a nondescript string.  The only 3 saving graces were:  his voice, \\"No Surprise,\\" and his voice.  Oh, wait, I listed his voice twice.  I might buy a third album, but if it's anything like this second one, I give up.

B0025KVLV0|4.0|I just picked this up from my local Costco at the same price that Amazon offers it.  Let It Be was the final release of the Beatles catalog in 1970, after having been recorded, dropped, remastered, dropped, then given to Phil Spector, whose hand is all over this album.  All in all I feel that Spector did as good a job as could have been done, especially since not one of the Beatles actually cared much for this product at this point.    There are a number of weaker songs, but the Beatles were trying to show themselves as a working band, not just as the studio magicians that they had become.  This au natural setting gives us a glimpse of what it's like to be a Beatle with their between song snippets of dialog.  These bits are quaint and endearing, even if you know that the producers even edited these pieces into the album (none that you hear are organic to the version of the song you hear).    That said, the 2009 remasters are wonderful, as the equipment had been hauled in from EMI Abbey Road as \\"Magic Alex\\" had not delivered on his state of the art studio in the Apple headquarters and the sound was VERY rough.  Spector's overdubs are kept whole (if you want to avoid them, get Let It Be...Naked) on the four songs he added them to (I Me Mine, Let It Be, The Long and Winding Road, and Across the Universe) and, except for maybe, and I mean maybe, on TLAWR, they sound fine to me.  Interesting note - Across the Universe is a version that was recorded at the same time as Lady Madonna and was not really a part of the Get Back/Let It Be sessions.    The new remasters clean up the sound a great deal and I am very happy with it, in fact, I like this newly cleaned version more than the ...Naked version, as ...Naked uses different takes and I have always been most comfortable with the takes we were originally given.  These sound incredibly improved.  The only problem is that the album itself has cuts that are either awesome or weak, nothing much in between.    A great improvementover the 87s.  Recommended. 3 1/2 stars.

0061841935|5.0|Ok.... I probably am a bit prejudiced. I love Craig's show ever since I found it and was ashamed of myself for not watching from late 2002 thru about mid 2006. I used to work, you see, and my shift work didn't allow me to watch late night tv. I left work in 2006, and received total disability so I was able to get back on schedule and found the most charming man with a beautiful accent that came on after Letterman. Didn't take long for me to get hooked! I bought the large print book, but wasn't sure I could read it. My depression causes me to have an inability to concentrate. So I bought the audio book as well, and if you like being read to, these cds are wonderful! I highly recommend this book in any form you wish to buy it!

It also says that Intelligent design is right and that jesus is the only way into heaven.    Buy this and rip out the introduction, then you'll have a copy of \\"THe Origin of Species\\". I got mine for free when they visited my college, I ripped the intro out right in front of them.

It may be that The Lost Symbol will be the means to prove, once and for all, if the premise behind the idea of Noetic science has any basis in fact at all.  If it does then the tens of thousands of people around the world who bought the book and are wishing that they had their money back will be getting a check in the mail any day now.

B00005K3NR|4.0|Here we are with Octoberfest horror film review number 11. As we've been consistently trying to switch it up between great horror, average horror, awful b, slashers, creatures, and classics we landed on Carrie which is well loved in the horror community. Surprisingly the old boy Sid and his many years of watching flicks has never seen Carrie. Really no reason behind it, guess it's just one of those that never made it on the priority list despite it's popularity. When it appeared on a movie channel the other night we figured we are due for a classic and might as well give Carrie a run.<br /><br />Carrie had a star studded cast lead by Mr. Saturday Night Fever himself John Travolta, Sissy Spacek, and P.J Soles (the \\"see anything you like?\\" chick from Halloween)who was just as annoying/hot in this one too. Since it's so popular here goes the standard brief Sid description; Carry White is the shy quiet girl in high school that nobody talks to. After getting her um..time of the month issue in the shower at school she's teased non-stop by the usual high school goons and hot chicks. The kids wind up getting in trouble and decide to take things out on Carrie when she goes to the Prom with jock Tommy Ross. Only problem is Carrie is a real mixer, a king mixer! She winds up getting some hardcore revenge with her telepathic powers.<br /><br />For Sid Carrie was a really solid flick, but not one that would offer anything more then the one time watch. Yes it was good, and yes it's a classic, but it just wasn't something we could do again and again like Halloween. It was nice to finally get it under our belt though since it comes with the utmost regard. Plus it's always nice to mix the horror genre up with all different decades and the 70's is one of the best. It does have that great gritty 70's feel that's a Sid favorite. Certainly one we would recommend to check out if you haven't already and probably one we would've liked back in the glory days. We sure Santa probably loves it.
B002BSHWUU|5.0|This is the way the Beatles were meant to be heard. The Cd's aren't over-produced by the remix artists and bring out the feel of the time and method in which they were originally recorded. It's like hearing them for the first time.
B00164GDD2|3.0|I got this hoping that it would be in clear 1080p.  It's clear but so it the graininess of the video.  It doesn't seem that the master was in very good condition and not much was done to clean up the picture.  Honestly you can get the same quality from an unscaled DVD which has mostly the same extras...  So if you have the DVD don't bother getting the Blu-Ray unless they come out with a remastered version.
0142000663|4.0|Over the years I have attempted to read this classic several times and failed because the first 100 pages are slow and daunting.  FINALLY - I was determined to plow (no pun intended) through this amazing book.  I had a tough time with the southern dialect but after a while I even got used to that.<br /><br />The Joads are a hard-working family looking to make a living after loosing their small tenant farm in Oklahoma in the 1930s Dust Bowl.  They are enticed as so many others were to the land of promise and opportunity - California. Unfortunately they are met with hardship, contempt, injustice, corruption, greed, prejudice and hunger to name a few.  How can a land so fertile and plentiful lay fallow or be exploited by a few and cause such heartache?<br /><br />The chapters alternate between the specific and intimate journey of the Joad family and shorter chapters which give a big picture of the migrant movement.<br /><br />This book affects you.  It is powerful.

0439023483|5.0|In a time when an obsession with reality television runs far and wide, Suzanne Collins has created a masterpiece where entertainment trumps humanity. In a post-United States era, the capitol of Panem must come up with the perfect punishment for the thirteen districts it controls after a revolution breaks out in number 13. The solution is an annual Hunger Games in which two teen tributes from each district are placed in an arena--complete with live coverage--and must fight to the death. Katniss is honorable when she chooses to attend as a representative for district 12 instead of her younger sister, whose name was drawn. Katniss is skilled and has a decent chance of surviving the games, having hunted the woods illegally outside her district for years. But does she want to? At what expense? Suzanne Collins has written a book that literally had me craving the next installment. Each and every word, every scene was stuffed with action, humor, and characters we become attached to. Like the movie Arlington Road, the possibility of this book happening in the future of our country is enough to keep me thinking about it long after I've turned the last page. Highly, highly recommended.<br />--Reviewed by Kerry O'Malley Cerra
0689865384|3.0|\\"The early summer sky was the color of cat vomit.\\"<br /><br />How can you beat that for an opening sentence?!? I laughed when I read it!<br /><br />I've heard great reviews about this trilogy (Which I recently found out actually has a 4th book.  To my knowledge it was planned as a trilogy.). I picked up all three off of Craigslist for $3.  I have to tell you, I read the back and wasn't sold.  It sounded totally stupid to choose between having an operation to turn you pretty or betray your friend forever.  I was wrong.  It was so much more complicated than that.<br /><br />Life for Tally is in a post-modern world where everything has changed.  We are the \\"rusties\\" and children go and visit the \\"rusty ruins\\" on field trips.  I thought that was great!.  The world changed because of prejudices.  People who were taller, prettier, with flattering figures got all of the jobs.  They were held higher in society.  So things began to change.  Now in Tally's world, at the age of 16, everyone has `the' operation.  They are made pretty.  It's a pretty horrific process involving drastic plastic surgery of the whole body.  Everyone has the operation.  If you don't, you have no place in society.<br /><br />When the Specials tell Tally that she can't have the operation if she doesn't help them find Shay, it isn't such a simple, petty thing.  They send her back to the dorms to live with all of the other Uglies.  She can't even go and live with her parents.  She basically has to give up life to protect her friend.  Hurting and affecting not only herself, but all of her friends and family.  A hard choice for a 16-year-old to make.<br /><br />I loved the imagination involved in creating Tally's world.<br /><br />I did have a hard time getting into the book.  In fact, I set it aside to read L.J. Smith's The Vampire Diaries~ The Awakening and The Struggle.  It wasn't  bad in the beginning, I just didn't get into it at first.  It was slow-moving.<br /><br />Once I got to the end of Part I, I was hooked.  I'm glad I stuck it out.  Tally's point of view totally changes when she realizes more about the Smokies (the Uglies who have run away) and what really happens during the operation.  She learns to love the Smokie way of life and finds herself feeling beautiful as an Ugly.  It really is a dig at the social biases that effect our lives today and a `what if' future if we continue life this way.  For me, the book dragged a bit at the end as well.  Overall though, it was a very well thought-out book and was enjoyable, once you get past the slow parts.<br /><br />Please come and visit me at my blog, Between the Lines, at [...].

0810983915|3.0|Over all I liked it, and thought that 3 stars is fair. The first three books made me laugh out loud, and they still do. However, Dog Days seems to be missing something. Maybe it's because this book deals with Greg and his summer vacation and the others dealt with school. I don't know, just something was missing. Don't get me wrong, this book made me chuckle at parts, but I didn't laugh out loud.<br /><br />This book deals with Greg and his summer vacation. Over the vacation he deals with his family, birthdays, friends and trying to find a summer job to pay off a bill.  In this book, Greg seemed to whine a lot.<br /><br />Over all, it wasn't bad, just not as funny as the first three.
0545123267|5.0|I was hooked from the first, very short chapter.  I just wanted to read more and more.  Unfortunately life got in the way and I had to set it aside a few times to do dishes, make dinner, love my kids.  Ugh!  The nerve!  If I had my way I would have read it cover to cover in one sitting.<br /><br />Sam is in love with Grace.  Grace is a human girl but Sam, however, is only human part of the time, the other part he is a wolf.  He knows Grace in both of his forms, but is too afraid to talk to her in his human form.  The words are so beautifully placed together, it flowed fantastically.  The characters seemed to realistic, despite one of them being a werewolf...and yes, I am aware how odd that statement sounds!<br /><br />I loved the romanticism of the love between them that was unspoken for so many years.  Also the idea that they are on borrowed time.  Sam knows he will only be human this last time.  Then what will the future hold?  I also loved that the romance wasn't all hot and heavy.  The love they shared was expressed in the brush of lips across a forehead, the soft touch of fingers across a cheek, a soft embrace.  Loved it!<br /><br />I read a lot of reviews on this book and everyone I read highly recommended it.  I am going to do the same.  I was totally impressed with the writing, the story, and the style of writing.  I loved the switch of POV between Sam and Grace in varying chapters.  I did not like the switch of POV in Breaking Dawn by Stephenie Meyers.  I think it wouldn't have been bad if Bella and other characters switched POV from the beginning, as in this book, but the Twilight Saga, the first three books and 1/2 of the 4th are told from Bella's POV and then switches to Jacob.  I literally said, \\"What the heck?!?\\" when I read it.  Okay...I'm going off on a tangent!<br /><br />Read this book!  You won't regret it!  I'm excited for the second book, Linger to come out next year!!<br /><br />Thank you to Kristen at Bookworming in the 21st Century for having the wonderful contest that won me this book!<br /><br />Please come and visit me at my blog, Between the Lines, at [...].  I'd love to hear from you!this book!    Please come and visit me at my blog, Between the Lines, at [...].  I'd love to hear from you!
0451197879|5.0|As i've said before, king's earliest are his best. This just so happens to be a richard bachman novel which in some ways is even better then a king novel because with bachman we know where getting a book thats going to jam itself down our throats and roadwork is no exception. To much has already been said and spoiled as i can see so i'll just say that this is grade \\"A\\" KING and should not be missed. I was skeptical myself but once again found myself drawn in inescapably. Don't worry about wasting your money, roadwork is worth every bit of your time.
1595141979|5.0|The best so far in the series. Rose has matured into her own person and makes some really hard decisions that will change every thing she has held sacred her whole life. It is fascinating, looking into the mind of this teenager as she wrestles with things that will forever change her life and that of those she loves. While a YA book, I'll bet that this series has been read by as many adults as teens. My daughter definitely had to wait on me to read it first. I can't wait to recommend it to friends who teach upper middle school and high school as a must to have in their homeroom libraries. The kids will fight over who gets to read it first.
B0017YWG2S|3.0|I like Carlos Jobin's music a lot so I was expecting this C.D.to be more exciting. I thought collection of music was rather poor and Regina sings with less fire. She could be better.
0385504225|2.0|I'm a fan of Dan Brown's Robert Langdon series, but this one was disappointing.  Robert Langdon didn't seem true to his character as defined in the first two books.  In the previous books, Robert proved the impossible, the improbable, the myth and the legend.  In this book he seemed to be fighting the myth, repeatedly saying 'it isn't possible'.  There were too many hints as to who the bad guy was too early in the book and the ending was way too predictable.  After reading the book, I felt Dan Brown threw the story together without the effort it needed to be a great book.  And I believe most are buying it based on his previous success (I know I did) hoping for an  entertaining story.  This wasn't a good read for me.  I hope the movie is better.
0385504225|3.0|Dan Brown's latest novel, The Lost Symbol, takes the reader on yet another journey with Professor Robert Langdon. Much like the other Brown novels, the author takes us on another scavenger hunt this time for the \\"lost symbol.\\" The novel may be too technical for many readers, and often goes way too deep to uncover hidden meanings and symbols. Looks like Dan had a little too much time on his hands since writing The Da Vinci Code. The story itself is very interesting, and the historical information on Washington held my interest. For the most part, The Lost Symbol was a page turner for me although I found myself skipping ahead in paragraphs because it seemed too descriptive or technical or just plain boring. The most disappointing part of this book is the constant regurgitation of philosophical and religious messages - we got it the first fifty times that someone said that humans are like gods. Also it seemed like Brown also felt like ripping off the Dolarhyde character from Harris' Red Dragon.  All in all, the story has an interesting twist, and I was able to actually finish reading without giving up due to lack of interest.
B002GZQYMK|5.0|In the Muse tradition this album is very different from the previous one.  This one has more of a dance/80's/chill vibe to it.  The first song is great with an awesome driving beat.  The second is a nice up tempo catchy song.  There's a song in there we a great Queen feel to it.  The last three tracks are more orchestral.  They have a slight classical feel to them but still very Muse.    Overall it's a great album.  Not at all what I expected, but awesome from first to last track.
0887306667|4.0|This was an easy read with simple concepts that can be put into place easily (if you ignore the politics of doing so).  However, the dated examples are a bit distracting.
B00006EXDM|4.0|\\"Hot Rocks\\" was certainly a popular album in its day, but on reflection, it is woefully incomplete. There are only 3 songs here that pre-date \\"Satisfaction\\", creating a poor overview of their early period. The set then rushes through the rest of the band's catalog up to and ending with the \\"Sticky Fingers\\" album and the two hits from it. This is an OK collection for the more casual fan who wants most of the major hits, but the followup set \\"More Hot Rocks\\" is far more interesting overall, scooping up the hits that this set missed plus giving the more involved Stones fan a good number of rarities. \\"Hot Rocks\\" seemed to have been put together hastily, but great tracks are in abundance, no question about that. There just doesn't seem enough of them.
0385504225|3.0|I have and read all Dan Brown's previous books. I expected an interested and original plot in this last book. Unfortunately the story was along the same lines as the Da Vinci Code and/or Angels and Demons: Just another story of another paternal secret society. The bbok was too long and repetitive. The plot was not really difficult to understand.  If I knew I would have never bought the book.
B000YIGNKE|5.0|My 2nd favorite Jane Austen story of unrequited love! This is the story of long suffering Anne Elliot (played tremendously by Sally Hawkins)who was persuaded at a young age to give up the love of her life Frederick Wentworth because of his lack of fortune and his naval pursuits. 8yrs later she's still single and considered a spinster and basically passed around like a servant to her ego ridden father,sister and other hypochonchiac sister. Frederick returns on the scene and tries to play indifferent to his attraction for her but they are constantly thrown together which makes temptation oh so hard to fight. I could not rest until I had this classic in my collection and highly recommend it to any true romantic.

B001PR0YFS|1.0|Rehashing the tale of corporate whistleblower Mark Whitacre, director Steven Soderbergh decided to play this one close to the vest by attempting to weave an intricate collection of scenes into an Ocean's Fourteen, only without Clooney and Pitt.  With Ocean's Eleven (or the other two), everything looks like a complicated sailor's knot: the viewer is not sure of the outcome and is convinced that something is out of place.  Upon completion we find out every twist and turn was necessary to make the knot work.  With [[ASIN:B001PR0YGC The Informant]], however, the knot ends up like five day old spaghetti; sloppy and unpalatable.<br /><br />ADM fast-tracker Whitacre (Damon) works in the lysine developing section of ADM and is a bipolar, pathological liar.  Leading a stuffy duplicitous life required of a top executive bringing down his own company, Whitacre exposes an international price-fixing scam by working closely with the FBI over the course of three years, during which time his lies destroy the investigation and his life.<br /><br />Stylistically it's a pleasant look back twenty years or so, almost like watching an extended cut of Mad Men...except not as biting.  The most entertaining aspect of this film is Mark Hamlisch's score.  Quirky and upbeat, it supplies contextual support like choppy violin strokes during a tip-toeing Tom and Jerry scene.  Oblivious to the world around him, Whitacre could very well hear the pseudo-Muzak elevator music that oftentimes accompanies his irrelevant, schizophrenic non sequiturs - the only entertaining aspect of the film.<br /><br />A convoluted, cinematic sedative, the entirety of The Informant! is at best mildly interesting, but at worst coma-inducing monotony.  During the rare scenes when the movie is not Sahara desert dry, it's almost sanctimonious.  Just like [[ASIN:B001JIE7JC Burn After Reading]], some Soderbergh sycophants will claim that those giving negative reviews have \\"missed the point.\\"  If by \\"missed the point\\" they mean \\"incredibly boring to the extent of almost persuading me to leave the theatre mid-movie,\\" then I suppose they're correct.the extent of almost persuading me to leave the theatre mid-movie,\\" then I suppose they're correct.
B001AQT0SG|5.0|If the theaters or David Lynch want to release the inferior 137 minute version of the movie then that's fine.  Make that a bonus feature, but ALSO include the 189 minute \\"Alan Smithee\\" version of the film that all the true fans know and love.  Blu-ray disc capacity is huge so there is no need to completely remove a valid and popular version of the movie, especially with how popular \\"Special Editions\\" are now.  The short version gives no background on the story, removes relevant scenes necessary for smooth storytelling, and makes the movie an epic masterpiece instead of a forgettable B-rated Sci-Fi failure.      Truth be told, if the 3hr version is on the disc I'll get buy it and I'm sure many other fans of novel and science fiction in general will be pleased.  However, if only the David Lynch 137 minute edit is released then many people will pass it by like the VHS, DVD, and HD-DVD releases before this.      Vote \\"this review was helpful\\" if you agree with me, I know there are a lot of us out there so make your presence known!
0385341008|5.0|When THE GUERNSEY LITERARY AND POTATO PEEL PIE SOCIETY was recommended to me as a fool-proof, satisfying read, I was a bit skeptical when I learned the book is a collection of letters. How wrong could I be? I marvel at the authors' abilities! I was so engaged in the story that I often went past my allotted night-time reading slot and yawned through the next day. Fabulous characters you'll fall in love with! I highly recommend it.
B001F0VHEM|5.0|Alecia Beth Moore -aka- PINK, has ultimately put the FUN back into and has made Rock And Roll the fun musical institution it was intended to be! She has one undeniable raspy, husky voice and immense talent for mixing politics, social trends, themes & commentary, love and life, into an amusing mix of her own brand of entertaining music. She is daring, sarcastic, rebelious[yet she maintains a mainstream pose, as we all do], playful, and has a great sense of humor. Even Pink's biographical sad, impassioned ballads and midtempo tunes are fun and entertaining, as she slams and expels her heartaches out while the lyrics drive their message home. We can all relate! Pink is adorable - she has become the peoples' voice on many issues and life changing events weathered in our everyday existences. Pink taps into and gathers inspiration from Rock, Punk, R&B-Soul, Folk, Glitter, Metal, Psychedelia, even a touch of Country flavor now and then, and occasional melodic tinges of Rap. From what I've seen of her video performances, PINK is also a master of entertainment and delightful show girl on stage - she pulls out all the stops and dazzles her audiences with her amazing performances. Pink captured my attention on her her mega-hit Radio/Chart singles, \\"U + UR HAND\\" & \\"SO WHAT\\" - two of her most fun rocking anthemic tracks busting full of guts, gusto, pomp and \\"don't jack with me\\" attitude. Can't help loving PINK for her eye rolling view of the \\"Stupid Girls\\", because millions of us are so over those misguided, fame seeking celebrities setting awkward examples for youngsters out there. FUNHOUSE takes up where \\"I'M NOT DEAD\\" left off, yet it pushes the PINK star up a couple notches higher up the scale as she throws playful darts at her subjects and life's situations. The hit singles are great, but there are even more fun tracks waiting to be discovered on FUNHOUSE. A couple years ago, Kelly Clarkson[Luv Kelly!] was poised to be the next Rock Queen, but her record company torpedoed her \\"My December\\" masterpiece, and PINK came out front and center as the new reigning Rock Goddess! Both artists are in a class of their own. I must say - I avoided Pink during the early stages of her meteoric rise, none of her music grabbed me, I'd change the radio staion, and wrote her off as another R&B poser - I sure Missundaztood! I'm a huge fan of LINDA RONSTADT, and while reading one of her interviews a couple years ago, discovered that Miss Ronstadt's daughter Mary Clementine had been exposing and turning her Mom on to PINK, and Ronstadt just had to mention Pink...at the same time, \\"U+Ur Hand\\" was all over the radio, and I got swept in. I can only say, Thank You Mary & Linda - my music library has grown steadily just on Ronstadt's name dropping alone over the years. I'll probably have to purchase the Pink Box to explore her previous three albums and see what I missed, and I'm itching to find out! FUNHOUSE is a blast - every track is a winner! Can't wait to get the Deluxe/Aussie Tour edition. Oh, and b/t/w Pink - You are COOL(!!!) Jess You-Know-Who is NOT! Pink is the COOLEST of the COOL!

0545123267|5.0|As my title suggests, I thought Shiver was a beautiful love story. I loved the way you got to read both Sam and Grace's POV. I thought it added a lot to the overall story.     The only thing I felt was a little off was how quickly they fell 'madly' in love. I don't mind getting to the point and having them liking each other, but I'm not usually as convinced when it's so immediate without any type of conversation or anything involved. However, that did not stop me for devouring this story. I loved it and will be back for the sequel!
0894803123|4.0|Great little book to start ice cream making with. The intro is mostly biography, there is a section to better understand ice cream making (key ingredients, why you need to use whole milk as opposed to fat free, etc), and the rest of the book is recipes. They have great techniques, but they are often in sidebars, rather than being on a separate page or chapter. As far as the recipes go, it is great- they have different ice cream bases, and suggest in each recipe which base works best for flavor. They also have recipes for sorbets, toppings (fudge, caramel, etc), and other desserts that can be used as add ins (brownies, blondies, etc). It also, obviously, doesn't talk about frozen yogurt. My only problem is that it isn't quite as organized as I would like to get to a specific technique, like adding a fudge swirl to an ice cream. Great buy.

0307588335|4.0|How do millions of people get to the edge of the cliff? What happens when the precipice upon which we are standing breaks off? Common sense would tell you not to stand on the edge of a cliff with millions of others wouldn't it?<br /><br />Is it the cliff's fault, or the colossal failure of common sense attributable to those gathered there?<br /><br />Only an insider such as Lawrence McDonald (and his co-author Patrick Robinson) can provide a poignant perspective having hung on this precipice.<br />This is a truly great read. Buy it. Think about it.<br /><br />If you must pick one book to satisfy your hunger for riveting insights into the rise and fall of Wall Street over the past several years, this is it. Lawrence McDonald (former V.P. of distressed debt and convertible securities trading at now defunct Lehman Brothers) and Patrick Robinson craft a thrilling and action-packed literary journey through this period. This book is written for a broad audience - you certainly do not need to possess a Series 7 securities license to thoroughly enjoy this book.<br /><br />The authors do a fantastic job providing the reader with a feel for the tension, the people, the context and the conundrum that, among other things, resulted in the collapse of Lehman Brothers. The authors use a phrase from Texas to characterize the realization that Lehman Brothers was on the verge of embracing the reality of a potentially fatal collapse; \\"big hat, no cattle.\\" --- A phrase that appropriately captures the challenge of the U.S. to emerge from the structural damage that has been incurred since the Fed and U.S. Treasury were required to step in and stabilize the systemic risk and ongoing aftershocks of Wall Street's penchant for irrational exuberance.<br /><br />This book makes a point that other treatments of this subject might overlook: A business is a group of people; real human beings with families, livelihoods, hopes and dreams. When people become deceived about the nature of the world around them, they have succumbed to myth and illusion - and begin making business decisions that compromise the welfare of all concerned, resulting, in this case, the collapse of Lehman Brothers.<br /><br />This book is replete with fundamental truths that we need to be reminded about, as we move ahead. The following excerpt is a prudent example:<br /><br />\\"The truth was, this was the starting point of America living in a false economy, because all this free money was in defiance of the natural laws of the universe. All bubbles, down the centuries, have started that way, leading to the inevitable time when people begin to think it's normal, that nirvana has finally arrived --- But, of course, it wasn't. It never is. You can ask my dad who watched the start of the insane credit boom in late 2003 by observing, dryly, \\"Here we go again.

B00005RDRO|3.0|I bought this film because I already had THE CHEAP DETECTIVE and since both were written by Neil Simon and had good actors like Peter Falk, Eileen Brennan, David Niven, Maggie Smith, Peter Sellers, Alec Guinness, etc, I thought it would be as good as CHEAP DETECTIVE, maybe even better. But MURDER BY DEATH is a bit disappointing despite the great cast. Truman Capote wasn't particularly impressive as an actor, one can only hope this was his single acting role. Still MURDER BY DEATH is worth a look and for fans who haven't seen THE CHEAP DETECTIVE, it might be satisfying. I recommend watching MURDER BY DEATH first because it plays a bit like a dress rehearsal for the other film even though only a few of the same actors appear in both.
0307269981|5.0|It's so rare that a book gets even better. This one does because it focuses on Salander, the most interesting character in the series. This book really gets into her and how she became like she is. This one really hit the mark with me and I look forward to the next one. You really do have to read the first one and then really get ready for the joy of this second one. Best series going. Too bad the author didn't live to see his success. Very sad but he left a nice legacy of good writing behind. He will be remembered.
0446672653|4.0|The book made me think about a lot of things I had never thought about before. Very interresting but perhaps a little too much repeating because I had read Many Lives, Many masters by the same author.  Still I do recommend the book!

B0015HOFZI|2.0|My experience with this unit is disappointing thus far.  I had confidence in the SONY name from prior experience however when I saw Made in China on the box I had reservations about trying it.  My issues thus far are:  After recording about 10 albums, the arm does not reset onto the post. Upon its travel down into the rest position, it abruptly moves toward the record and rests midway between the record and the post creating X number of minutes of static if you walk away while recording.  However, the software makes it easy to clean off the static but I shouldn't have to do that.    I've taken very good care of my albums over the years, wiping with a Diskwasher D4 system prior to each play, and never touching the groved surface with bare fingers, etc.   My old Technics turntable plays them without incident.  Upon playback of songs from the SONY unit, I find random skips on some tracks that never had them before, perhaps due to the lack of a counter weight on the arm?       One of my first recorded albums had what sounded like electronic skipping throughout a few tracks however this may because of incorrect software settings.      Admittedly, I'm not an audiophile and need to read up on the nuiances of recording analog to digital and on the capabilities of the software that was supplied.  My expectations of plug-n-play may have been too much for the price point.

0439023483|5.0|My impressions:<br /><br />1.  The book immediately reminded me of the TV show \\"Survivor.\\" Except kids are to kill kids and death is the only way out of the arena.<br /><br />2.  Children often carry the brunt of the misery in a dystopian young adult novel. Their endangered well being is a visible warning to adults who might want to think on their own and might want to make the world a better place than what is available.<br /><br />Readers need to know before reading:<br /><br />1.  utopia vs. dystopia<br /><br />2.  Speculative fiction<br /><br />3.  Post-apocalyptic<br /><br />Some questions I asked while reading:<br /><br />1.  Why is there more to history than \\"they\\" are willing to tell us? P. 44<br /><br />2.  Survival = killing and murder.  Winning = killing and murder.  Why these concepts are valued enough to be celebrated and televised?<br /><br />3.  Why would the killings in The Hunger Games make the citizenry feel that there was no way to rebel?<br /><br />4.  Why do the adults \\"just\\" accept this way of the world rather than put a stop to the slaughter to 11 children every year?<br /><br />5.  Why in a \\"perfect\\" world, are there such distinctions between the \\"haves\\" and the \\"have nots\\"?<br /><br />6.  Why do child warriors have to be gloriously dressed to impress the TV audience?<br /><br />7.  How does being in the Hunger Games make an individual \\"someone\\" vs. \\"no one\\"?<br /><br />8.  Why is it important to be yourself and to be true to yourself in order to win the Hunger Games?<br /><br />9.  Why do the warriors have to \\"sell themselves\\" to the viewing audience if they are to be true to themselves?<br /><br />10.  The children learn that \\"stupid people are dangerous.\\"  Why would this be important to learn when being a contestant in the Hunger Games?<br /><br />11.  Viewing the Hunger Games is a sport. Watching children kill each other is a sport. Why is adults killing each other in war bad if the Hunger Games are sport?<br /><br />12.  Children are nomore than pawns manipulated by the government. Why is this government allowed to exist in this nation?<br /><br />13.  How important are alliances when you know that you will eventually have to kill them off in order to win/survive?<br /><br />14.  What impact will winning have on the winner? What will their emotional future be like?<br /><br />I have read the second book in the series and cannot wait for book three to come out!!!

B001AVCFK6|5.0|Yes this Star Trek movie is a somewhat different take on the original, but I think it fits really well.  It's Star Trek movie making brought into the 21st Century.  The plot and characterizations are certainly well done, and the energy is kept moving from start to finish.  I couldn't find a dull moment.  The movie ended in its well rounded conclusion, and I was left on the edge of my seat thinking only, \\"and what happens next?\\" as I found myself impatiently waiting to see what the next adventure would be.  It's like Harry Potter fans who finish the book and can't think about much else except the next one they hope will be coming out.  Though some Star Trek fans do not like the changes made from the original series or movies, the creators of this version paid very due respect to the original and took it into a slightly alternate reality, one that I think fits current sensibilities much better than the earlier versions can now.  So, as long as it's the same team doing it again, you did a great job, let's see another!
B002HWRYJE|3.0|While I will probably pick up the movie on DVD when it comes out, I wasn't too impressed after seeing it in the theater.     Things I wasn't too thrilled about:  - Over the top cheesy lines.  Although, in a way that fits with the original series.    - Same old same old of some random villain showing up trying to destroy everything.  I'd really like to see one or a series of movies that break out of this old mold.  - Same old same old of odd time-travel/time-space screwed up situations.  Since when did Star Trek decide to start making this a requirement for new content?      I remember coming out of the movie responding to someone who was asking me what I thought.  I said something like the action and visual effects were really good, but it didn't really impress me in any other way.  I'm part of \\"The Next Generation\\" (Along with DS9) group, so I prefer the \\"smarter\\" Star Trek that came out back then.
6305252572|3.0|The movie gets four stars: see the other four-star reviews to see why.  It's a great, fun, rough movie.  Murphy's great and Nolte is very effective in his role.    The DVD transfer gets two stars for a bare-bones non-anamorphic DVD release.  The image quality is good -- I can see very few artifacts on my screen, with very solid blacks -- but it's inexplicable to me that Paramount would not by now have released a special edition of this movie, with a proper anamorphic image and possibly a commentary.
B000001FFJ|5.0|I learned of Tom Waits in the last year and thought \\"where have you been all my life?\\"<br /><br />This album is great, quirky fun. The poetry is fabulous. Some of the songs carry me away somewhere while others have me bouncing around, giggling and smiling like a ten-year old girl. The only one Waits song that could make this album more perfect would be the addition of Step Right Up.<br /><br />I must warn Waits newbies that this is musical-art, not anything like you'd find in the Top 40.<br /><br />If you like things like experimental jazz and non-linear poetry I think you'll really adore this album. If you're more into pop, you'll probably want to skip this one.

B000RUYQ2Q|5.0|Prince found his sound on this classic. talk about being the zone?  Prince hit the brass ring on this gem as a songwriter, producer, arranger,instrumentalist and his vocals were slamming.  Prince had a incredible Hybrid of styles and sounds. He made synths and Programmed beats into a wold of there own. the Man pretty much did everything on this album and when you hear the grooves you can't help but be impressed. everybody and there Granny know about \\"1999\\", Little Red Corvette\\"  but the Jam is  DMSR. in truth with all due respect to Purple Rain the song, DMSR was the cut that best summed up Prince back then and this was his National Anthem. and you got the coldness and tough funk of \\"Lady Cab Driver\\".  Something in the water does not compute\\" is the best Jam when you are dealing with a Bi-Polar situation.Prince nailed it on that track. automatic was cold on the Synth Funk. so much going on and so strong.  but he saved the best for last because International Lover was a smoking slow Jam.<br /><br />if you want to hear a artist put it all on the line and cover a wide base of styles and yet blend the past and present and set the stage for the future then this is the Album for you.<br /><br />the Man is a Musical Genius.
B00127RAJY|5.0|The last workout video I bought was Jane Fonda in the 80s so I was skeptical that a 20 minute workout would be effective but Jillian makes you work out hard and with no apologies. This quick workout is a refreshing change from my usual elliptical or pilates workout and even though it is brief, I am finding that I need to psych myself up to face Jillian because it is not easy. Regardless of your fitness level, take her recommendation and start at level 1. It is a challenge. After 4 times at level 1, I moved up to level 2 and I am still getting used to it. I now understand how Jillian gets those Biggest Loser participants into shape. She is creative and demanding but before you have time to think about how challenging it all it is, the workout is over. For anyone who needs more convenient, home-based workout routines (parents with small children, hectic work schedule, etc.) this is an outstanding option.
0156027321|3.0|This is an improbable but enjoyable tale written with a style that is sometimes, but not always, totally engaging.<br /><br />What is immensely enjoyable is the sardonic relationship between a small boy cast adrift on a life boat with only a grumpy Bengal Tiger for company. Yann Martel's ability to carry this allegorical 'dialogue' for the best part of the book is simply outstanding.<br /><br />I enjoyed Life of Pi and I'm very pleased I read it but am a little surprised at the praise bestowed by so many.

0385504225|3.0|I will start by saying that I did enjoy this book.  It was a fast read, easy to follow, didn't jump too much between scenes, the characters were generally interesting and well-described. My disappointment lies in the feeling that this book was written with the primary purpose of being a novel-to-screenplay adaptation.  The book has several chapters which seemed to stall, and then the last few chapters moved swiftly, as if it was a long movie trying to wrap before the two-hour mark.  The story line is intriguing, and having visited our nation's capital just this summer, I already want to go back there again to see some of the details that Brown describes in his story.  I truly enjoy Robert Langdon as a lead character, but I would like to see some more recurring characters in Brown's novels if he is planning to continue with the Langdon series. For example, I am a Clive Cussler fan, and I can honestly say that one of my favorite characters of his is not Dirk Pitt, but instead the jovial St. Julien Perlmutter.  His appearance in many of Cussler's books is a welcome interruption in between the action and chase scenes that are so common to his story lines.   I've read several of the other reviews here on Amazon and it appears that many other folks share my feelings about this book. I would definitely recommend that it be read, but if you've never read Brown's books (and no, watching the movies doesn't count!), start with Angels & Demons, then The Da Vinci Code, then this book.  You'll be able to better appreciate the character development of Robert Langdon as well as Brown's writing style.  Enjoy!

0316010669|4.0|This book is a real eye opener. It isn't quite like a how to book as the sub title suggests. It is more of a book that explains the brain works. The title suggests is is about how to think. It really focuses on how the brain makes decisions.     The points are very interesting but nothing revolutionary. He goes back several times to the point how the brain needs just enough information. To much information overloads the brains and slows the process. These principles are things you already know and experience but didn't quite realize. After reading the book you will find out why those things happen. Through reading the book your mind will start to work. I am sure the average person will think of things where they could apply the principles.  I am sure some people will reap huge rewards from the principles in the book. Most will just be enlightened. Overall it is a real good read.

0061964360|5.0|\\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is undoubtedly one of the most beloved classic novels in history -- it's had countless adaptations, sequels and homages lavished on it over the years.<br /><br />And Jane Austen's grand opus is still beloved for a good reason. While it's rather stuffily written much of the time, it has a vibrant core of witty dialogue and strong characters that shine like lanterns in the night -- and the best part of it is the interplay between the two strong-willed main characters, whose initial dislike of one another blossoms into love once they learn how to overcome his pride and her prejudice.<br /><br />The Bennett family is in an uproar when wealthy Mr. Bingley moves into the neighborhood, and Mrs. Bennett is especially happy when he takes a liking to the eldest Bennett daughter Jane -- since their estate is entailed and there is no Mr. Bennett Jr., a good marriage is considered essential for at least one of the girls. But her forthright, independent sister Lizzie immediately butts heads with wealthy, aloof Mr. Darcy, who scorns the rural village and seems haughty about everything.<br /><br />A flurry of proposals, road trips and friendships happen over the course of the following months, with Lizzie fending off her slimy cousin Mr. Collins, and befriending the flirty, hunky Wickham, who claims to have been wronged by Darcy. Lizzie believes Wickham's account -- and she's in for a shock when Darcy unexpectedly proposes, and reveals what Wickham won't tell her about both of their past lives, and what Wickham did to offend Darcy.<br /><br />And finally things take a scandalous turn when Lizzie's idiotic younger sister Lydia elopes with Wickham, while staying with a friend in Brighton. The family is plunged into disgrace, which also wrecks any chances of a halfway decent marriage for the other daughters. The only one who can set things right is Darcy, who will do whatever he must to make amends to Lizzie -- and unwittingly establish himself as the man she loves as well...<br /><br />Reading \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is a bit like watching someone embroider a piece of cloth with subtle, intricate designs. Lots of balls, dances, visits and drawing room banter between Lizzie and virtually everyone else, and interwoven with some rather opinions from Jane Austen about haughty aristocrats, marriages of security, entailment, and the whole idea of what an ideal woman has (intellect and strength).<br /><br />The only real problem: Jane Austen writes very much in the style of her literary era -- it's rather formal and stuffy much of the time, and the narrative is kept distant from the characters. So, not for casual readers.<br /><br />But despite that formality, Austen's brilliance as a writer is evident -- she slowly unfolds the plot one act at a time, with several intricate subplots that tie together and play off each other. She also wrote some unbelievably sharp-edged dialogue with plenty of witty banter between Lizzie and Darcy (\\"I could easily forgive his pride, if he had not mortified mine\\"). But Austen also weaves in startlingly romantic moments between them (\\"No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you, can think anything wanting\\").<br /><br />It's hard to imagine a better fictional couple than Lizzie and Darcy, despite their rocky start (a major-league snub at a dance). Both are witty, smart, and a bit snotty in their own ways, with quick minds and even quicker tongues. Darcy is a selfish, rather haughty man man who gradually becomes warm and kind, while Lizzie is strong, independent, and Darcy's equal in every way. And neither will marry for anything but true love.<br /><br />It also has a solid supporting cast: the painfully practical Charlotte Lucas, slimy clerics, virtuous-looking rakes, sisters ranging from saintly to snobby, and the lovable Mr. Bingley and perpetually optimistic Jane. Lizzie's family also adds plenty of color to the story, including the screechy and hilariously mercurial Mrs. Bennett and the barb-tongued Mr. Bennett (\\"Your mother will never see you again if you do not marry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you again if you do\\").<br /><br />Despite its mildly stuffy style, \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is the ultimate Jane Austen novel -- a powerful and romantic story about two people who grow and change because of love. An absolute must-read.ongued Mr. Bennett (\\"Your mother will never see you again if you do not marry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you again if you do\\").<br /><br />Despite its mildly stuffy style, \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is the ultimate Jane Austen novel -- a powerful and romantic story about two people who grow and change because of love.

0061730327|5.0|After reading The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind and listening to William Kamkwamba speak at Northwestern University yesterday, I want to shout from the rooftop to all teachers and parents, \\"Your children need to hear William's remarkable and inspiring story.\\"  I've been a high school English teacher for twenty-six years, and, every once in a while, I read something that speaks to me in such a profound way that I feel compelled to share it with my students and my own two sons, ages ten and thirteen.  This is one of those books.  I find that kids care deeply about our world and its people, yet they often lack an informed awareness of others' situations.  Too often when they do learn about issues of concern in our world, they feel despair and hopelessness.  William offers quite an alternative to that hopelessness and despair.  After reading his story, it's hard for anyone to say, \\"I can't do anything.\\"   William's story leads us to consider some of the most significant issues that our world faces, including access to food, water, and education. What I love about this book is William's response to these challenges.  When his family can no longer afford to pay his school fees during a time of famine, William turns to the library to try to keep up with his studies, hoping that he will eventually be able to return to school without being behind.  It's in the library that William runs across a book that leads to his building a windmill, all while he, his family, and many others in Malawi are on the verge of starvation.  He and his siblings typically ate only about three swallows of nsima a day during this time.   He sees in the windmill a potential solution, the ability to generate the power needed to operate a pump for water and irrigation so that his family and others would not find themselves on the verge of starvation ever again.   His generosity of spirit, ingenuity, creativity, hunger for knowledge, perseverance, and compassion are stunning.  Young people need to believethat they are capable of making a difference in the world.  William shows them a way even in the face of enormous obstacles, obstacles many of us will never face.  When I heard WIlliam speak, someone in the audience asked who inspires him.  He mentioned Martin Luther King, Jr., among others.  In particular, he spoke of King's saying, \\"If you can't fly, run; if you can't run, walk; if you can't walk, crawl.\\"   Towards the end of his book, William speaks of \\"a new kind of Africa, a place of leaders instead of victims, a home of innovation rather than charity.\\"  That is something that I want my children and students to see.  I find that students often complain about how depressing all the literature that they read is.  If we want them to read, we need to offer books that truly matter.  If we want them to act, we need to offer them stories such as William's that are uplifting, informative, and inspiring. After reading Three Cups of Tea by Greg Mortenson, forty-five of my high school juniors raised $30,000 to build a school in Moshi, Tanzania, and fourteen of them traveled to the school for its opening.  As one student said after reading the book, \\"Greg took away any excuses we had for not doing anything.\\"  I have no doubt that William's story will have the same sort of impact.  After his speech, I asked what he is working on now at school.  He described, among other things, the Doers Club that he founded.   Let's hope the publishing world also creates a young readers edition for kids ages 10-14 and a picture book for the younger set so that we multiply the number of doers inspired by William's model working throughout the world.

0024181900|5.0|Strunk & White's \\"The Elements of Style\\" is a wonderful book, and it is great for learning grammar, in that it is witty and demonstrates the rules of grammatical and compositional style in a way comprehensible to human beings. It has great examples and is able to show students what to do by telling them what *not* to do! It is easy to carry around, and is so concise, that you should be able to read it in two hours, at the most. If you talk or communicate in any way, this book will most certainly be useful for you!
006109594X|4.0|I found this book on a book swap shelf at our resort in Playa del Carmen. I thought the book was a page turner. I read it over the course of three days and it was exciting in many places.<br />A good book to read at the beach. Of course I did not pay for it and maybe if I did pay full price I may have been a little disappointed.
B001FB4VXU|5.0|The second season was not quite as good as the first but even so this show is so superior to most network programing that five stars are definitely called for. And certain episodes were abosultely as hilarious as anything ever seen on tv. I pre-ordered this one and have been very satisfied with the quality.
B000SXBPAS|4.0|Duran Duran was at the top in the 80s' and quietly sank beneath the waves. Only to resurface with this great album. With 'Come Undone' and 'Ordinary World' at the Helm, they have surfaced, with that \\"Duran Duran\\" sound tweaked for the 90's and still strong in the 00's.

1932100660|5.0|a friend highly recommended the book - yet after reading a lot of the one star and two star reviews, I decided not to buy.<br /><br />then changed my mind - but left it on the shelf for a long time.<br /><br />then read the book - and bought 8 more to give to family and friends.  You have to decide for yourself - but I was convinced.<br /><br />I'm still working on changing the diet... takes a little more work and I can't just count anymore on the stuff in the fridge being good any time I get around to using it... it actually goes bad.  But so far so good and it's good to feel that you can count on good results if you are moving in the right direction.<br /><br />I highly recommend that everyone read the book.
0385504225|4.0|I had intended to be awake when Kindle began downloading this book at 12:01 AM.  To paraphrase Dan Brown, 'If our ancestors could see us reading a book, much more getting it in this fashion, they'd have thought we were gods.'<br /><br />However, having read all Brown's books, this one did not make me want to call in sick from work to keep reading it.  It seemed like a formulaic version of The DaVinci Code...but with a really weird bad guy and an unnecessarily fascist CIA boss.  And does he have to keep saying \\"disorientated\\" when \\"disoriented\\" would do nicely.  I don't think I'm being picky, he used the word so often, I couldn't just forget about it. Finally, as the daughter of a Shriner and Eastern Star, and former Worthy Advisor myself, the Masons did not elicit the sense of mystery in me which would enable me to believe the story line. The story line being that somebody thinks they can become all-powerful from finding the lost symbol. Who thinks the Masons have The Answer!  Okay, so they have An Answer.<br /><br />All that said, however, Dan Brown has done his homework.  His knowledge of the meaning of symbols, and all their cross-cultural appearances is amazing.  For example, all the ways the number 33 appears in different religious literatures is fascinating.  Where does he get this stuff! And I really look forward to learning more about the science of Noetics.<br /><br /> I think using Robert Langdon to explain all this is a clever way of getting across a major premise of the book. That premise, I think, is that people across time and cultures have a common sense of awe which is expressed through their own culture and symbols.  If we could just get away from idolizing the symbols, we might be able to get to the godliness in ourselves and in others.

B000ATQYT2|5.0|Muppet Christmas Carol has been my family's Christmas Eve tradition for about 10 years. I mean, we kept our lame old VCR down in the basement because we would forget to buy the DVD before Christmas each year and get stuck watching the VHS. I finally got motivated and ordered a copy for my parents and siblings.     The movie looks great, and the bonus features are pretty good considering the movie is from 1992. I SWEAR that a scene is missing from the part where Scrooge gets dumped by Belle and she sings that hilariously serious song \\"The Love is Gone.\\" Not that I miss it, but we did notice it seemed shorter because we had less to make fun of.
0060776749|5.0|A good history of the band.  It satisfied a lot of curiosities I've had about them.  Edge's essay in the first few pages is one of the best I've ever read.
B001FB4VXU|5.0|A sit-com you'd want to actually watch over and over??? This is it - sharp, unique, funny, endearing cast, fast-paced but not manic, smart and not reliant on  crude sex jokes.
1416550542|5.0|What a beautiful book! I REALLY enjoyed this epic story. It was fascinatingly plotted, with rich characters and historical detail. I loved the whole fairy tale-angle, as well. The book just reminded me of stories from when I was younger. The premise of a four year old girl arriving after a long sea voyage with nothing more than a suitcase - and not a memory at all, is intriguing and the mystery of this woman's past is more than strong enough to keep you turning page after page! All in all, I really enjoyed it. A wonderful read and I definitely want to read anything else she writes!
B002FOQXZK|4.0|There is no desire on my part to put artists in a box, however, I think Cudi has an alternative-hip-hop album on his hands.  This record isn't rapping in the traditional sense; but then again, it is rapping in a stream of consciousness sense, along with spoken word type singing. Yes, Kid Cudi is sort of singing and the fact that he doesn't sound at all professional is part of the charm.    Everything about this album is modernistic.  Cudi has (rapper) Common narrating; The songs are presented in a thematic order and Cudi is formally introducing himself through all of his songs, beginning with \\"Soundtrack 2 My Life.\\"  Some songs sound like a complete freestyle such as in \\"My World.\\"  A freestyle that is made to sound effortless, yet stellar in its performance.    This entire record is taking rap in a much needed, different direction.  There is explicit content, yet on several of the songs,I don't hear it.  Could it be because Kid Cudi has something to say and I'm actually focused on it?  Last, but not least, Cudi has his own sound. He had a few featured artists on board but they don't overpower him.
B000R7GKQE|5.0|Love this series.  The second season carries on with the overall plot, but doesn't lose the creepy feel.
817224164X|4.0|Many say this translation, The Manheim, though filled with anti-Hitler footnotes, remains truest to the original.<br /><br />Houghton Mifflin published a translation by Ralph Manheim in 1943 to avoid having to share their profits with Reynal & Hitchcock. They also wanted to offer a more readable translation. The Manheim translation was first published in England by Hurst & Blackett in 1969.<br /><br />There are numerous errors in this translation, however. And it doesn't identify a number of important references. Moreover, it omits examples or even mistranslates common sayings of Hitler.<br /><br />When Manheim was unsure of a word (for example Sheepshead meaning the Bavarian card game), he left it untranslated in the original German.<br /><br />Some passages are also missing from the Manheim translation, most likely due to the fact that he could not translate them or did not understand them.<br /><br />Finally, Manheim's translator's note in the front of his translation show his is a biased translation.<br /><br />Little needs to be said about the words of Hitler. I enjoy reading Mein Kampf. That certainly is not an endorsement of the man or his movement. Mein Kampf is an interesting look into the mind of this man and it is interesting how we can see some of the same characteristics running in numerous people in office today. If we don't know history, we're apt to repeat it.<br /><br />Indeed, Hitler might even have won a Nobel Peace Prize based on his promises and the excitement he created in people before they really got to know him had the prize been given in those days! Certainly such greats as JFK and Churchill gave him glowing compliments.<br /><br />Why did people follow Hitler? Knowing what we do now, it's easy to think the German people were stupid. The truth is the country had suffered a severe punishing war and hyperinflation -- money was worthless. They needed a real leader.<br /><br />Hitler promised everyone everything. He was just the \\"right\\" person for that particular time. If times had been different, he would not have risen to power in all likelihood.<br /><br />I find Hitler part genius, part psychopath.<br /><br />The book -- no matter what translation -- is a must-read. It's a classic. It's a book that gives you insight into one of the most important minds of the 20th Century and in all of history.<br /><br />Why should you read any translation of Mein Kampf? Sun Tzu said you must know your enemy. We read about those we regard as dangerous, or wrong or criminal in order to avoid that type of individual ever encroaching into power again. We also read to understand that person in relationship to the times in which he lived.<br /><br />Just as Hitler knew his dreaded enemy, the Communist Party and Karl Marx, we should know Hitler, the Fascist dictator. Hitler didn't take on an issue or an enemy without knowing it inside-out. In that regard, he was brilliant. He knew what he was fighting. He knew the enemy.<br /><br />I recommend Mein Kampf (The Ford Translation) to you. Although I do find the Manheim translation better than most previous to Ford. I also recommend Mein Kampf Official Nazi Translation to you.<br /><br />- Susanna K. Hutchesonrisen to power in all likelihood.    I find Hitler part genius, part psychopath.

B000021Y77|5.0|I watched \\"Run, Lola, Run\\" without any real insight on what to expect.  I had gotten the idea that it would probably be of more interest to young adults but I can attest that us older folks can enjoy it too.  I admit that I was initially wondering if I was going to be watching a movie or a cartoon but I got to like the animated version of Lola running down the stairs.  The lifestyles on display leave a lot to be desired but I let myself glide past that once I realized what a multi-facetted movie this is.      \\"Run, Lola, Run\\" is a movie that shows us a lot of stories within the stories and a lot of alternate scenarios.  If you're one of those \\"if only\\" second-guessers, this is your chance to find out \\"what if\\".  I liked the variables and I thought that the movie was quite unique in that regard.  I won't give anything away although that, itself, may be misleading.  This film challenges our expectations and, in doing so, might be giving us a glimpse of the future.  I recalled a pavillion at the World's Fair Expo '67 in Montreal.  It was, I believe, the Czech pavillion and they showed a movie that stopped at different points in the film when there was a major development.  There was a \\"time-out\\" and the audience was asked to vote for one of several directional options that they were given and the movie proceeded with the requested option.  \\"Run, Lola, Run\\" looks like a movie in which the production staff got several chances to vote on their options and decided to include them all.  It works!
0385504225|4.0|If you weren't a fan of his previous work, then this isn't going to change your mind.  It follows the same pattern of Robert Langdon's previous adventures, combining action/suspense with some plot twists, puzzles and Brown's version of history thrown in for intellectual stimulation.  But I think it's a formula that works well and I've been enjoying it since The Da Vinci Code.    Honestly, I don't think it quite lives up to the last two novels.  I thought that The Da Vinci Code provided a  more interesting story, while Angels & Demons had better pacing and more action.  This book took a little longer to get going and I felt it went on a little longer than necessary after the climax.  But the bulk of it was a great read and shows why Brown is so successful as an author.  He knows how to write a great page-turner and the story telling feels like you're reading the equivalent of a summer-blockbuster.     The only reason I gave this book 4 stars is that I feel giving it 5 would mean it's on par with the previous two-which I feel it's not.  However, it's a great book and something that will keep you flipping through the pages for most of it.
B001UW58YK|5.0|Não conhecia Michel Buble, a não ser por uma música chamada \\"home\\". Primeiro, o descobri no show do David Foster. Buble é sensacional. Lembra o Frank Sinatra.

1401323820|5.0|I love the show Castle, so I was very excited to pick up this book -- and I wasn't let down. At first I wasn't so sure about the inclusion of the Castle-type character (with the not-so-subtle name of Rook), but eventually the parallel to the show grew on me. The title character Nikki Heat is a strong, independent woman who can really kick some butt, and she made a good protagonist. I loved the \\"action scenes\\" in the novel in particular, and thought they were very well-written. Any fan of Castle should definitely pick this up.

0061841935|5.0|Just finished listening to the audio CD which I chose over the book as hearing him tell the story would make it, to me, a lot more interesting.  And it did.  Hearing the Scottish accent that we're so used to from the Late Late Show makes it more personal and he can sure talk, as we all know.    There's no excuses, no \\"I'm a better man now,\\" just his honest opinion of himself and why he did the things he did and how it hurt him and those around him.  And what finally led him to stop it and get on with his life.    Best part about the CD is you can work while listening, which I did all day and still get involved in the telling.
B001GM28HO|5.0|Lady GaGa is well GaGa. She's sensational and so are her songs. Every single track in this album means something. Though I must add that only 2 tracks I got dissapointed from (I won't tell in honor of the Lady) but as a whole, it's worth every penny. I swear, if she keeps up, which I hope so willingly, I'd think she'd be staged to be the next Queen of POP music. Although, I must say that Britney Spears also fits quite in that category (as being the next Queen of POP and all)-(I lov brit, don't ask)....I feel that GaGa has the power and Britney just has the might-factor.  Anyways, I don't want to bore anyone and for those who skipped the 1st paragraph, I repeat, THE ALBUM IS AMAZING!!!
B001GQSY5U|1.0|Watch the 2005 Cartoon Network Non-CGI animated series of shorts and you'll know what I mean when I say this doesn't measure up. The 2005 shorts deal much more with the other films.

0618001905|5.0|Almost all of us have forgotten that what we are taught in school is very censored and sterilized.  The heroes are chosen not for what they did but for what our leaders would like us to see and think.  This goes on everywhere whether you are in the United States or the Union of Soviet Socialist Republic (USSR)  But, once in a while someone actually to digs up the facts and put then in a book for all to see, and these people always go through hell to get the word out.  Adam Rothschild has done that.  And brilliantly I must add.  A Must Read Book!
B000YI7MRM|4.0|\\"Alatriste\\" is an epic film from Spain dealing with the life and adventures of Captain Diego Alatriste, a soldier during Philip IV's reign.<br /><br />The movie tries to cover the events set forth in five of Arturo P&eacute;rez-Reverte's novels about the Captain in a mere 145 minutes.  I've only read two books in the series.  Where the film dealt with events in the books I knew, it came across as a painfully abbreviated Cliffs Notes version of the source material.  Once it moved into unfamiliar territory, I enjoyed it more.<br /><br />I think \\"Alatriste\\" will be enjoyed most by viewers completely unfamiliar with the books.  Taken on its own the film is an entertaining, if slightly confusing, swashbuckler.  Although there are plenty of thrilling battle scenes and duels, this isn't a simple action picture; some knowledge of 17th century Spanish history will certainly help the viewer understand the major plot points.<br /><br />This was the most expensive movie ever produced in Spain, and the money spent on it shows in the final product.  The production is first rate, with an excellent cast headed by Viggo Mortensen as Alatriste.  The costumes and sets are exceptional, and the cinematography gives the film an atmosphere reminiscent of a fine old painting.<br /><br />Fans of the books will be disappointed.  \\"Alatriste\\" would have been improved by devoting the entire film to the events of just the first book.  Or, the Spanish producers could have taken a page from the Hollywood play book and given us a series of sequels.  There is certainly enough interesting material in the books to sustain several movies.<br /><br />The Fox International DVD (Regions 1 and 4) has scene selection and features language tracks in either Spanish (Castellano) or Portuguese; subtitles are available in English or Portuguese.
B00009R6J7|4.0|I would have given it 5 stars if it wasn't over-priced. But it is a great tool for getting shots nice an level. It also doesn't fit very snugly into the hot shoe, so I have to be careful not to knock it off.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|Awesome product, very well designed and presented.  49 DVD's of great writing of a truly great tv show.    It's sad that John Spencer (Leo McGeary) passed away, I think that the West Wing would still be on tv with Jimmy Smits as President and John Spencer as the VP !!

B00009NHC5|5.0|Like so many others, I too love this movie and am pleased with the DVD release.  Rather than repeat what others have said, I wanted to add my own little side note: in addition to leaving front doors unlocked, who in the current time would send an eleven year old girl out at night by herself in Manhattan to the Port Authority Bus Station to wait for buses?!?  While I was scared for Hepburn's character in that little apartment, I was also scared for the little girl skipping off into the darkness! Also, it would have made more sense to send her to the nearest police station rather than to wait at a bus station in hopes of running into Hepburn's husband - ah well, movies!    But don't let that stop you from seeing this movie.  It's worth every second of great suspense!
0060849827|4.0|This is a handy little field guide that should help you out if you ever survive a plane crash, shipwreck, or get lost in the woods.  The size of this book (about 3.5\\" x 3\\" x 1\\") makes it easy to take it everywhere with you.  Some of the concepts require more explanation than is given, and some of the diagrams could use a little better labeling, but overall it's a great tool.  After all, you can't devote 8 pages to instructions on building a lean-to.    I'd recommend it for the camper, boy-scout, and frequent traveller in your family.
B002I9Z89Y|4.0|Bascially this is the same set as the remastered/restored season two set released late last year on DVD except with superior encoding and, of course, Blu-ray 1080p resolution. The second season of \\"Star Trek\\" was almost as strong as the first with pivotal episodes developing and filling in the background on the major characters of the show. It also introduced Chekov (Walter Koenig) as a regular member of the cast.<br /><br />Episodes like \\"Amok Time\\", \\"The Doomsday Machine\\" and others benefit from the new digital visual effects. The nice thing here is that you can toggle between the old and new visual effects with this set.We also get some terrific extras here including \\"Star Trek The Animated Series\\" episode \\"More Trouble, More Tribbles\\" as a tie-in to the original episode included here as well as the \\"DS9\\" episode that celebrated the anniversary of the original series. It's upscaled from 480p for its presentation here and while it doesn't look quite as good as the episodes included here it does suggest that the show look exceptionally good if they go back to the original master film elements and transfer them to Blu-ray (they'll probably have to upscale the visual effects though). We also get commentary tracks on \\"Trouble\\" and \\"More Trouble\\" by writer David Gerrold.<br /><br />The rest of the special features have been ported over from the original DVD set. All of the original special features are ported over in SD.<br /><br />Blu-ray Live content includes \\"Writing for Spock\\", \\"Creating Chekov\\", \\"Listening to Actors\\" and \\"Spock's Mother\\". The Mobile Blu content is what's troublesome; evidently it causes problems for older players to access the episodes themselves. For example I can't play these discs on my older player which is kept upstairs. I would suggest that Paramount/CBS make sure that the discs are backwards compatable with older players. One of the issues that dogged blu-ray early on was the fact that it wasn't a finished format. The easiest way for the winner of the format wars to be a loser is to tick off consumers and requiring them to buy new players.to be a loser is to tick off consumers and requiring them to buy new players.

There truly is not a bad track on this entire record, and although a lot of the songs have a similar tone and sometimes you'll find yourself wondering if you've even moved on to the next track, this is still a must have for any rock fan. If you haven't picked this one up yet, do yourself a favor and go get it.

B001BPJJ9G|5.0|I will admit, just looking at the cover of the DVD case, when I picked it up in Blockbuster, I wasn't very excited about seeing it.  I'm not normally one for the strange artsy movies, but my friend recommended it and he said it was one of his favorite movies.  So, I went ahead with it.<br /><br />The story follows the very unlikely relationship between a young stuntman and a little girl, while they were in the hospital after their accidents.  The girl takes a liking to the young man and he begins to tell her a story about an evil ruler and the journey of 5 men who wanted to kill the ruler.  There are plenty of fights, a little romance, and you find out that the stuntman actually has a deeper reason for telling the girl the story.<br /><br />The costumes are breathtaking and the acting was wonderful.  This movie is definitly on the top of my list of favorite movies.  I recommend at least renting it first, because the movie is definitly not for everyone.  But, you should see it at least once.

B001P06GX4|4.0|We got this game because the reviews were excellent.  It IS a good game, but I don't think it's quite the total sensation others do. I do recommend it - our just-turned-five-year-old can play it with us, although we have to help her out a little.  It's fun and does force spatial reasoning, and a game is over with fairly quickly.  I'd rather be horse-whipped than made to play Monopoly, but that's just me.    [...].  We did this but I used four large elastic bands that we can put on/move/take off depending upon number of players rather than a Sharpie because for some reason I just didn't want to draw on the game board.  We actually enjoy it more as a 2 or 3 player game rather than each person playing two colors. It all just seemed to come together better.  Thanks, other reviewer!~!    I don't think it was really a very good value for the money - plain cardboard board - dinky plastic pieces - but I think most board games are a huge rip-off, aren't they?  A little \\"tray\\" of some sort for each player to put their pieces on would be a nice addition, because if you lose even one of the pieces, it will screw up the outcome.  I am sure the replacement pieces are available for a \\"reasonable\\" price, plus s&h from the manufacturer!     Overall, a fun game to add to the stash, but it doesn't beat out my all-time favorite, Connect Four!
B00000I8UD|1.0|1 1/2    From the languidly limp length of the opening track, one can already sense this too-long release won't be quite as midnight-chic as Sylvian was hoping, working from a template dealing primarily in dated trip-hop beats, stale world artistry, esoteric electric noodling,  and washed up charisma, at times coming together to offer slick background air at best.
0156421178|5.0|My husband and I moved to Barcelona earlier this year and decided to start reading classic novels about Spain and Catalunya. I just started reading it and can't give my opinion, but my husband absolutely loved it. It's a little silly, but he was giddy about it. He read it every chance he got, and finished it within 3 days. He's a quick-read, and I'm not. He's been telling all of our friends here about it and we plan to pass it on to them when I finished.
0375413405|5.0|I bought this book after watching Julie and Julia at the movies. It's great. So far I've only made a few things but they've turned out perfect. The crepe mixture is fantastic - best crepes ever and the Coq au vin was delicious. I would recommend this to anyone who loves cooking (and taking a long time to cook). It's definitely not a book for monday - friday but for the weekend when you have more time to dedicate to cooking.

B002PGO7X8|5.0|Kid Cudi's Man On The Moon is the best cd I have heard all year. It is so refreshing to hear something out of the ordinary, that I can also connect with. Each track is brilliantly written, produced... Kid Cudi is the best thing out. Don't skip out on this! it'd be a mistake.
B0006V6TMG|5.0|I may not be as indelibly stamped as some of the Jesse Cook fans here. But to me, Montréal is Cook's best work! Track by track, it's solid and hangs together beautifully.

B001W63DX2|5.0|Flight 666 The Film follows the band during their Somewhere Back In Time tour in the 23 concerts the band were plaing. Being a huge fan of Iron Maiden, when Flight 666 came out this June along with soundtrack of the film(the live songs on disc 2)I had to buy it. This film was said to be showing the band's life on tour and everyone who knows the band know that they are private to a certain point about their lives. Here they are showing the fans what it's like to be in the band or working for the band. And I haven't been disappointed, I've been surprised on how complete it was as it goes into details and there are interesting stories from the countries they played during the tour.You have to understand first that Iron Maiden is not your average band. No other band has a lead singer who also pilots the band's own private plane during a tour across five continents. They are also respected everywhere they go and they have influenced many bands of today.<br /><br />You have to admire them for staying down to earth people even with their success and for the fact that they have many great songs and albums. They are entertaining onstage and fans will find out just like I did that they are as much offstage. Capturing the intensity of band on tour is not an easy task but Sam Dunn's team (for those who don't know him, he made the Metal - A Headbanger's Journey and Global Metal documentaries which I would recommend watching if you are a fan of rock n' roll music or heavy metal or whatever YOU want to call it) just did that, I'm glad they were the ones who did this documentary as someone else might have screwed up. Oh and this is not about Dunn it's about the band.<br /><br />The purpose of the Somewhere Back In Time tour was to offer their increasingly younger fan base those classics song they might not have seen the band perform before. This means for the band going back to the classics, for this tour they performed songs like \\"Rime Of The Ancient Mariner\\"(Bruce Dickinson said it was his favorite song to perform during the tour) and \\"Can I Play With Madness\\". They always played their old stuff but this goes further into the songs they didn't play, of course the tour still featured songs they always play like \\"Number Of The Beast\\" and \\"Fear of The Dark\\". The stage set was even reminiscent of the one used during the Powerslave tour mixed with a little of Somewhere In Time, it looks very good. The live footage shown in this film will likely blow you away, the band sounds amazing.<br /><br />It also shows people talking about Iron Maiden and their stories are interesting to hear. For instance the Priest who has many tattoos of the band and claims to be their biggest fan. Or someone saying just how much an Iron Maiden concert means to them, for how long they've been waiting etc. It may sound boring here but it certainly isn't. You see the road crew, how they build the stage, the fans nearly making a riot at a hotel where the band stays. It seems everyone was having fun during this tour, everyone smiles and tells jokes, fools around or something, you see that the band enjoy each others company and they still like selling out their concerts all over the world.<br /><br />Iron Maiden has always been exciting to watch and this DVD is another reason why. You also get another disc of the 17 live songs used on the Flight 666 soundtrack; the songs have been picked from different cities so each song is different from another and makes a show altogether. The film shows a good part of this disc already but if you only want to watch the live part it's nice to have. I have it and I've watched it already a good dozen times and each time I find it as good as before. Live After Death is the best Maiden concert DVD but Flight 666 is a great look at the band and is just as good. If you're a fan this a must never before has Maiden been shown this way, it's hard to believe just how good it is. It's hard to describe but if you are a fan of the band you just have to see this.There two versions the special edition has a better booklet, I own the standard edition as it was what was available to me.e special edition has a better booklet, I own the standard edition as it was what was available to me.

B002FOQXZK|5.0|I'm going to have to agree with every 5 star review on here. Kid Cudi is the greatest new artist out right now. His music is so innovative, he is like nothing out there. He is beyond hip-hop, he is \\"dat new new.\\" Album of the year for sure in my book. Every song on this album is perfect, which is hard to find these days. So you are doing yourself a disservice if you don't buy this album. Hope Kid Cudi keeps coming out with songs because he is beyond great. How could you not like the guy? Great at rapping, singing, song writing, his production is perfect.... Just buy this. Kid Cudi, Thank you so much for this, don't know how long I've been waiting for a perfect album but you gave it to me.
0439023483|5.0|Once I got past the first few pages, I was unable to put this book down. Excellent pacing, characters and plot line.
B002GZQYMK|3.0|First, let me start off by saying that upon hearing the album the first time I would have given it a '2 Star' ranking.  I have listened to the album several times now and several songs have grown on me.  Let me also state that my ranking on the album is based on MUSE albums... not on music as a whole.  Compared to your typical Miley Cyrus or Brittnay Spears album this would be ranked 4 or 5 stars.    However, since I consider Muse to be in a league of their own I thought it only appropriate that their ranking system should be based solely on their previous albums.  Let me also say that Absolution is in my top 3 favorite albums of all time.  The Resistance, however, did not live up to my lofty expectations as to what I had considered standard from Muse.  The Mainstream wanted Muse to 'make it' soooo bad and Muse tried to give the people what they wanted.  Instead the resulting album feels more like a pop flop than an arrival of any sort.    I'm weary of standing behind an album such as this.  I feel like I don't want to be the guy that was telling everyone that 80's music was cool and then it turned out to be a decade of garbage.  Before you rate this album 4 or even 5 stars, listen to the band's previous work and see if The Resistance is a natural progression or a step in the wrong direction.
1439102813|2.0|Reading this book, I felt as if I was the one who was \\"losing\\" it.  Yes, the author has done her homework and knows all the symptoms of early onset Alzheimers and dementia.  She manages to work each one of them into her story.  But a writer she is not.  It is hard to comprehend the mass appeal of this book, given that anyone could find all of this information online, if they needed it, and as a work of fiction this leaves much to be desired--clunky dialogue, stock characters, clumsy prose, predictable plot.  If you want to read a first rate work of fiction about early onset Alzheimers, seek out Alice Munro's heartbreaking short story, \\"The Bear Came Over the Mountain.\\"  And then rent the brilliant movie, \\"Away from Her,\\" based on the story and starring Julie Christie in the role of her career.  Two years after seeing this movie, it still haunts me.  Five minutes after finishing this novel, I couldn't even remember any of the characters' names, except the very predictable, not very interesting Harvard professor Alice of the title.
B0013FSL0C|5.0|Great series - can't wait for the second and third! Came highly recommended from a colleague and I wasn't dissapointed - will appeal to anyone who thinks that (a) being a therapist is easy and (b)wants to entertained as a genuine adult. Not idealized or mythologized, Gabriel Byrne's non-specific psychodynamic approach encounters real-world challenges in the form of diabolical patients and his own crumbling marriage. After four sessions with the same clients each week we see 'Paul' in supervision trying to come to grips with his own unconscious and counter-transference. Very true to life, clearly well scripted and researched, In Treatment is a rare treat in this modern world of managed health care and the dreaded cognitive behavioural paradigm of intervention.
B001THZAAI|5.0|Excellent French comedy about a man transfered from the south of France to the furthest northern town in France.

B000NA2776|5.0|Where as MIKA been all my life. This album is in a category all its own. Musically it's just impossible to describe the beautiful laid tracks that support MIKA's also talent as a vocalist.    This album is alternative in that it encompasses more than your average pop music. MIKA, who has declared his self bisexual, brings his sexuality to this album. Not in an overbearing way, but clearly when you hear the album you know this is an album by someone who is comfortable opening many doors and exposing themselves to be criticized by their musical talent.     Listen to the track \\"Bill Brown\\" to get a further understanding of MIKA's ability to encompass a world that usually stays behind closed doors. \\"Grace Kelly\\" is a pop hit, and falls in the lines of the other tracks on the album, but has a greater appeal to others who will only hear the one single. \\"Lollipop\\" is a fun track with a super catchy tune, this is playful and cute!    MIKA scores two thumbs up for this album. I look forward to listening to his follow up album which was recently released.

B002KQ6BT6|1.0|Da Vinci code was new, fun, different... and had a strong plot. Disappointingly, this book is flat, repetitive, the plot is predictable, much of the action is completely unbelievable - it is unlikely that anyone who has lost half her blood would be able to run around like a rabbit even after having had a transfusion, to say nothing of someone who was drowned in any liquid for a period of time. Mr. Brown, we need more from you than the basic $$ making formula! And readers, you might enjoy L. Goldstone's Anatomy of Deception instead. Well written and founded on historical facts, a good story.    And dear Amazon: how do you include that book on your 2009 top 100 Customers picks when it has received more 2 and 1 star ratings than 4 and 3? I know, by sales volume -- but when more people dislike than like a book, I would hardly call that book a top customer pick!

B002KVSJ64|4.0|Since this is one of my favorite bands, I have been waiting for new Breaking Benjamin for some time now. I think their previous albums have all been in the realm of greatness, but not so with \\"Dear Agony\\".      This time around, the songs seem a bit thin and the overall tone of the album is subdued. And while almost every song is solid, few really blow me away.      Now,that's not to say that \\"Dear Agony\\" is bad, because it's not. It is a very solid effort. But I believe every other Breaking Benjamin cd is great, and \\"Dear Agony\\" is not.     It's my personal opinion that the band has gotten busy with side projects lately, and this album suffers a bit because of it. Just my opinion.     Again, \\"Dear Agony\\" is a solid effort, and any Breaking Benjamin fan will enjoy it. It just doesn't move the scale the way their previous efforts did.

B000BSNPRG|5.0|I have become a fan of Within Temptation who perform heavy metal at the symphonic end as once did Nightwish, and a new group Epica.  This particular tour includes 3 concerts, 2 of which are just excerpts but the famous Java Island concert is great value. I am 72 and came to heavy metal very late in life, and I love this group and the spectacularly high quality voice of Sharon, the lead singer.  The disc set is well worth the money.  dr Teri O'Brien, D.Sc
B001EN71DQ|5.0|Sure, the acting is cheesy, the ending is already crystal clear, but you get exactly what you expect with this DVD set: Star Wars and all its beautiful, moralistic dialogue and plot.  Grab your popcorn, sit back, relax, and enjoy.

B001DJ7PQ4|4.0|The doctor is in, and this series proves that while not all is always well with the universe, all is solid with the doctor. David Tennant as the doctor and Catherine Tate as his travel companion both give strong performances that sometimes are most endearing. His performance is nothing short of brilliant, and Catherine Tate proves to be his perfect compliment.    These adventures seamlessly interweave pertinent details from previous series with an element of surprise or two. If you missed these details while watching on television, the DVDs give an opportunity to pour over them anew. The writing is excellent, but I'd expect nothing less. This series is not to be missed.
0312370849|1.0|This book was recommended by a woman who works at a used bookstore I frequent.  A bookstore which has 3 floors and carries [...] historical books.  Not your typical bookstore.  So I trusted her stellar recommendation as she called Sarah's Key \\"the book of her life\\"...practically swooning as she said it.  Eyes heavenward, hands clenched over her heart.  Mind you she didn't mean HER life story, but her all time favorite book ever ever pinky swear.  So I bought it.  I got about half way through, rolling my eyeballs, realizing I was had.  And I had told her I disliked elementary-style writing such as The Notebook and she agreed and swore this book will be amazing and everyone she has lent it too has the same reaction.  Liars. I stopped reading it yesterday while poolside, but first skipped ahead to the part where Sarah makes her way back to the house just to see what happened.  Then I tossed the book to the side of the patio.  Hours later I was watering the plants and had forgotten about the book laying there. So it got hosed.  And when I saw the soggy mess, it felt good.  Hrmph.  A better book which I've started is The Good Earth, by Pearl Buck.  Although the writing is straightforward, it's not like it was written by a 7th grader. It's very interesting and I am quite certain it's going to stay dry.

B002C1BHIO|5.0|So I'm not an engineer with a mini-laboratory in my house where I can send electromagnetic pulses to test my electronics and I'm not insanely wealthy either.  I'm just a regular guy who wants decent cables for his electronics and these cables are excellent quality at a nice price.<br /><br />First off these cables just look and feel thicker and sturdier than the cheap cables that are also sold on this site.  Secondly you get much less cable clutter using this over the huge RGB cables your cable/satellite company will likely give you (but check first to make sure they support HDMI output).  Third, you just open a box and grab your cable rather than deal with those horrible clamshell plastic cases.  Fourth, and most importantly you get Amazon's warranty for a year if you ever run into a problem with it.  So the next time someone tries to guilt you into buying a $100 pair of Monster cables with your electronics purchase you'll know what to do.

B000000I0I|5.0|To me listening to Ommadawn is like spending a few days in beautiful nature, trips you come back from not only relaxed, but full of optimism and desire to get things done. It always fills me with light that stays a while.<br /><br />Ommadawn is composed of two parts, and it is followed by a song, On Horseback. The amazing guitar solo of Ommadawn part 1 is like a bird learning to fly, very consistent in its approach but not successful until the final few minutes when it finally becomes airborne. Our melody becomes introduced to us right away by the acoustic guitar and being repeated by Celtic folk and other instruments Mike chooses to use which are introduced to us later on throughout both parts of this composition and including panpipes, uilleann pipes, timpani, glockenspiel bodhran, banjo, bouzouki, harp, mandolin, cello, trumpet as well as acoustic bass and classical and acoustic guitars, including a 12 string guitar. At the same time, the use of drummers of Jabula is combining our northern Celtic experience with the African elements and making this 1975 album one of the first world music records of value. After 4 minutes like an ugly duckling appears the electric guitar. Everything sort of stumbles in its tracks, the music is not progressing that much although it is a pleasant walk across this melodic back and forth landscape. In 9th minute electric guitar appears again, does not seem so out of place any more and this guitar starts building the music and our experience. Human voices singing nonsense in Gaelic develop a song without meaning but full of magic transforming it into an incantation more than anything else. Perhaps it was heard because on some level everything from that 15 minute or so awakes, the ugly duckling by now is turned into the most beautiful and powerful swan and it is this instrument which brings on the absolute beauty of the last few minutes of Ommadawn part 1. Ommadawn is like an argument supporting the fact stating that it is not the goal alone but our way to accomplish that goal which is worth our life experience. Play the last 4 minutes of Ommadawn part 1 and yes you will hear some great music, but no, you will not experience it in the same way you would have, had you started from the beginning. The solemn mood of the first 5 minutes of Ommadawn part 2 falls upon us like the reality of a goal already accomplished. A sudden realization that new dreams need to begin again for us to fill fulfilled. But then these awesome Scottish pipes blow that feeling away. Mike Oldfield's conviction contained in the lyrics of On Horseback although have turned some away from not only that short experimental part of the album, places all of us again in front of his passion, if we have not heard it clear enough in his music.<br /><br />Back in 1975 I used to listen to a lot of German electronic music and I was really into Klaus Schulze's Timewind and coming the same year from the group he left behind Tangerine Dream's Ricochet. The other great albums introduced in 1975 were Supertramp's Crisis? What Crisis? and Queen's Night At The Opera. However, to me personally 2 other albums could have been the greatest( not only of that year, but the entire decade.) Pink Floyd's Wish You Were Here with its magnificent Shine On You Crazy Diamond and Mike Oldfield's Ommadawn. It will most likely always be one of ten best albums of my life. Mike gained the majority of his recognition after 1972 at the age of 19 for Tubular Bells, which was his most popular album. Personally, I liked the following album Hergest Ridge more, but I did not truly fall in love with Mike's music until Ommadawn came out in 1975. Mike's following double album Incantations is spectacular as well and I place it right behind Ommadawn. They both have elements of electronic, acoustic, world and highly spiritual music, or that is where they take you. I find them both uplifting and grounding at the same time.alone but our way to accomplish that goal which is worth our life experience.

B000007XUQ|5.0|I have always loved Christmas music and when I was growing up, I excitedly bought a vinyl copy of \\"Christmas Portrait\\" since I grew up listening to Carpenters music. The experience listening to this record was pure joy! I kept playing it every Christmas until it got scratchy. Therefore, when it first came out on cd, I immediately purchased a copy which made me appreciate the cd all over again because of remastered sound! It was actually a special edition cd because it combined the best parts of \\"Christmas Portrait\\" and \\"An Old-Fashioned Christmas.\\" I do not see copies of this cd anymore. I am glad that Christmas Collection was finally put out because we finally have two (2) classic cds in one beautiful set. I must say this is the definitive Christmas album because of the wonderful Christmas songs, Karen's angelic voice, Richard's lush arrangements and the over-all effect on you which gives you that warm, Christmas feeling. My only regret is that Karen never got to sing my favorite Christmas song of all time, \\"O Holy Night.\\" Just imagining how Karen would have sounded had she been able to record this wonderful Christmas song. I also keep thinking if Karen had the chance to sing a duet with Josh Groban. It would have been magical! Two distinct and wonderful voices coming together for a Christmas duet!

B00004LN16|4.0|AC/DC is an old reliable, a sound that is pure and unchanged which should make them easy targets for music critics and other cynics but they and their success is unassailable.  The brothers Young do one thing only and they do that one thing about as good as any songwriters/bandleaders have ever done - make straight up, no frills blue based rock. On 2000's `Stiff Upper Lip', Angus and Malcolm Young bring in a old cohort from the Australian recording days, older brother George, the production chores but if ever a band was self-produced, even with someone else credited with the job, it is AC/DC.  In the 20 year of ` Back in Black's release, the band's longtime lineup complete with Brian Johnson, Phil Rudd and Cliff Williams make most blues based record in many a year, maybe ever.  Lead title track sets the tone and while many of the later song titles, lyrics and tempos may seem redundant, that is really the charm of AC/DC. \\"Can't Stand Still\\" (rare solo from Malcolm!), \\" Can't Stop Rock N' Roll\\" and \\"(Can't) Hold Me Back\\" show once and for all that these guys ain't emulating Wordsworth, but that really has never been the point.  \\"Satellite Blues\\" and \\"All Screwed Up\\" are some of the more tasty cuts on an album that may end up like junk food (instantly pleasurable, but almost as immediately forgettable) but fans will be pleased. Ironically for such a by the numbers recording act it would take another eight years to record a follow up to `Stiff Upper Lip' but then again AC/DC are one of the elite bands (Rolling Stones) which can take an epic length hiatus and return as if they have never left.  Their best days may be behind them and Angus may be losing his hair (but never the shorts!) but AC/DC can still deliver the goods.

B000B589JI|4.0|The Zippo Fuel Canister is leakproof, and holds an adequate supply of fluid for a lighter refill, or for a top-off on my pocket hand warmer.  It has a vent hole  that you need to orient up when pouring, so that the fuel leaves the canister in a smooth fashion - it pours well!  (The vent hole is covered by the cap seal when the cap is in place)    The only problem that I had was with the ring that attaches the pocket clip/key ring and flint storage device to the canister.  The ring opened and the flint holder came off and was almost lost.  (That is why this item was not rated a 5).      I replaced the Zippo supplied ring with a split ring of a similar diameter (split rings never come loose - some hardware stores sell these in a variety of sizes)  This addition cost me 15 cents and now I have a product that is a \\"5\\".  Too bad Zippo didn't do this to begin with. (Interestingly, the ring supplied for your keys is a split ring!)    One other note, if you have a greasy splash on your shirt, pouring some fuel on it followed by a clean cloth can stop the grease stain before it sets - a nice added use for the Canister!
B001AVCFJM|2.0|Roger Ebert hit the nail on the head in his review when he said, \\"The Gene Roddenberry years, when stories might play with questions of science, ideals or philosophy, have been replaced by stories reduced to loud and colorful action.\\"  That sums up my feelings perfectly.      This is not a terrible movie.  It's not great, but it's not terrible.  The problem is it doesn't feel like Star Trek. Even when Trek was boring, it still had more brains than brawn. It was about how humans who were above petty bickering solved important problems. This movie misses the mark. It is all action and almost NO story, let alone an intelligent one.  When I heard about this film, I thought it would be redundant with the original series, but it's not even redundant.  It's just pointless.    If you have never been initiated into the world of Star Trek before, then by all means, see this movie. It's a spectacle of lights and sound, and that aspect of the production is great.  If you enjoy this movie, I suggest going to the source for a more edifying experience. The Original Series, The Next Generation, and Deep Space Nine are EXCELLENT series. This movie is best seen as an appetizer for the main course, and I hope that any future that Trek has on television does not derive from this movie, because it is quite a few rungs down from what we have already been given.
B002S0OBFK|5.0|This movie is very scary. Althought it is only absolutly terrifing for only about 1 min total, but the rest of the movie is funny and suspensful.
0385504225|3.0|While I enjoyed the book and the writing, the editor needs not to be afraid of fame and learn to reduce the repetition.  The story just dragged in parts that should have been cleaned up and the experience would have been much more enjoyable.  I'll not be so quick to buy his next book.
0385340575|5.0|\\"Gone Tomorrow\\" brings Jack Reacher to New York. He's riding on a subway train and stares at a woman who has most of the points of a female suicide bomber. When he rises and approaches the woman to see if he could talk to her, she pulls a gun and kills herself.<br /><br />After giving his statement to the police, he meets the woman's brother, a cop himself. He tells Jack that his sister, Susan Mark, worked for the Pentagon and wouldn't kill herself. There must be something more.<br /><br />There are men outside the train station. They ask Reacher if the woman gave him anything and if she mentioned John Swanson or Lila Hoth. She hadn't but these names give Reacher subjects to investigate. Swanson is a Congressman who wrote a book about his life. Reacher discovers that he had been in the Delta Forces and won a number of medals but the details were not revealed.<br /><br />Compelled to find out what was going on with Susan, Reacher travels to Washington, DC. He meets with Swanson but the Congressman doesn't shed any light as to why the woman felt compelled to commit suicide.<br /><br />Then Reacher travels back to New York. He meets Lila who states that she and her mother are in New York attempting to find a soldier who had a relationship with her mother when she was in Berlin. Susan Mark was helping them. She also asks if Susan gave Reacher anything.<br /><br />As the page turning novel moves on, we are given insight to Reacher's thoughts. We find that Reacher believes that Lila and her mother appeared sympathetic but there were holes in their story. They wanted info that would harm the Congressman and maybe the United States. Reacher must find a way to stop them, without knowing what is on a memory stick that Susan stole from the Pentagon.<br /><br />Child's last novel, \\"Nothing to Lose\\" was disappointing. However, with \\"Gone Tomorrow\\" he is back at the pinnicle of action thrillers.<br />Having privy to Reacher's thoughts makes him even more interesting and Child's descriptions of New York and its inhabitants are right on the money.ht on the money.
B002BKIERI|5.0|Snatam Kaur has the voice of an angel and I never tire of listening to her.  This CD is a bit different than the previous four I have purchased and I LOVE IT!  Track #1 is my personal favorite so far, and if you sing along, it can make you weep with inspiration from the poem by Saint Francis of Assisi.  All other tracks are wonderful and I give it a big thumbs up and 5 stars.  Snatam Kaur freely shares her gifts vocally, instrumentally and spiritually for all to be at their own peace, yet inspired.    Manish Vyas shares his beautiful, soulful voice with Snatam and he in his own right, is truly a joy to listen to.      Guru Ganesha Singh and his amazing guitar talents also make this CD a 5 start winner.  I purchased one of his solo CD's, \\"Pure Ganesh\\" and is a excellent CD to add to your music library.    \\"Liberation's Door\\" is excellent music for just about anything you are doing and want something positive to listen to!    Thank you to all who participated in creating this CD and for providing such amazing and much needed positive music!
B001FB4W0C|3.0|Exterior cover came in great shape, shipped new, but the case for the dvd's was broken at the bottom.  DVD's were in perfect shape and are all playable, inside the cover you wont be able to tell the caseing is broken, but for a new item i expected it to be in perfect shape.

B000VEA30W|4.0|the product was perfect. its only defect was a slight break in the plastic box
0385504225|4.0|As much as I enjoy Dan Brown, I thought that Lost Symbol was almost too focused on the lectures and I think the plot was not as strong as his other works.  I didn't feel I knew enough about Peter to care enough in the beginning to really feel the urgency Langdon had to save his friend.  I know the CIA and others were involved near the onset, but I think skirting around the reason why they were there took away from the story.  Also, some of the \\"surprise\\" moments in the book were a little formulaic and predictable.  I think the main issue I had was with the opposition. In Angels and Demons, the reason why Langdon was chasing Illuminati signs was because they were clues.  In Da Vinci code, it was because he was under suspicion for a murder and had to clear his name. I think that this book lacked that type of intensity.  However, over all, the book was a nice, quick read; and the information about the Masons was very interesting.
B000002MG0|1.0|This is not a review on the album itself. BUT for anyone looking to purchase the vinyl be aware...the vinyl arrived in good condition but 2 songs (Man on the Moon and Nightswimming) have terrible sound quality with what can be best described as wonky and off key sounding instruments.

6305127646|5.0|Based on the series starring Roger Moore, who would go on to even greater fame as James Bond in seven classic films, \\"The Saint\\" is reborn...this time from the writer of \\"Die Hard With A Vengeance\\" and the director of \\"Dead Calm,\\" \\"Patriot Games\\" & \\"Clear And Present Danger.\\" Starring Val Kilmer (\\"Tombstone,\\" \\"Batman Forever\\") and Elisabeth Shue (\\"The Karate Kid\\"), this film is an adrenaline-charged, suspense-filled ride from start to hair-raising finish. Listen for a surprise cameo just before the end credits. (It's \\"Saint\\"ly). Though I prefer the new ending, I would like to see the original ending as Jonathan Hensleigh and Philip Noyce envisioned the film. Disregard the PG-13 rating. It's tame, compared to \\"Good Luck, Chuck\\" and other salacious movies being released nowadays. Rated PG for action-violence and brief strong language.

B001TH7GT6|4.0|I've been buying cable for electronics for over fifty years. In lots of instances, a wire is a wire is a wire; it's the quality of the connection that often makes the difference. These cables attach securely and easily, and that's what I want to happen. The color-coded connectors feel solid, though I would have preferred the color-band to encircle the connector completely to make it more visible in the dark recesses where these kinds of cables eventually hide. When connected to my current HDTV, I saw nothing to complain about picture-wise. These cables come with gold-plated connectors, and while I have never personally met anyone who can tell the difference between a TV picture displayed through such connectors versus connectors that are not gold-plated, it's nice to know that you'll be able to avoid the argument by purchasing these. Value-wise,I thought these cables were not monstrously overpriced, although you can find less expensive versions even on Amazon.<br /><br />The packaging is, as the title says, frustration-free. The cable arrived in a plastic bag that was not sealed, and the bag was in an easy-open shipping box. For some reason, however, Amazon chose to put that box inside another box to ship to me, and I would have preferred to see less packaging waste. Indeed, the plastic bag containing the cable could have gone into a sturdy envelope, and both boxes could have been eliminated (thus reducing the cost of the product!).<br /><br />This is a quality product worthy of the Amazon brand.
B000002N3N|5.0|Perfect packaging.  Fast delivery.  Would definitely purchase from this seller again. Fantastic sound - her best yet.
0307266303|5.0|This was an incredible read. I first picked it up looking to know more about barefoot running and its effect on form, endurance, and injury rates. I got what I was looking for, but I also got an incredible story.    This book is full of sudden tangent stories about everything from the creation of ultra running races, the evolution of the human body, and how the downfall of society is directly linked to the creation of the running shoe. While a little jarring at first, as they take you out of the primary story arc, these stories all weave together in the end to create a beautiful and moving whole.    I can only hope that everyone has a chance to read this book and understand its message. If we can do that, the world will be a stronger, healthier, happier, and more positive place. And all it takes... is running.    I give Born to Run, by Christopher McDougall, an easy 5 out of 5 stars.
B0029LHW4U|5.0|The comeback story you were hoping for.  A new, more mature Alice delivering the same beautiful music they've always managed despite their personal difficulties.
B002ELM5HY|4.0|I'm enjoying this album. It's relaxed; not the same as Dire Straits, which had grunt and fire. But a master in his element, further down the road. I enjoy it like I enjoy contemporary Steve Winwood, Eric Clapton and Kate Bush. All brilliant, and all alive and well.
0375842209|4.0|The Book Thief is a difficult but powerful read. Although it's been marketed as a Young Adult novel, I regard it more as a novel with a young adult protagonist, which does not necessarily qualify it as a Young Adult novel. Considering the fact that the novel is narrated by Death, set in Nazi Germany, and features many heart-wrenching scenes, this is a novel that might be suitable for some young adults, but I certainly don't see this as your quintessential YA novel.<br /><br />Enough about the marketing...although I found it a challenge to \\"get into\\" the book at first (the narration is peculiar and takes some getting used to), once I was hooked, I came to love the rich characters, poetic prose, and clever plotting. Zusak has crafted a window into a world (the town of Molching, Germany) that we rarely see--Germans who did not necessarily sympathize with the Nazi regime. Through the characters of Liesel Meminger, her foster family, and her neighbors, we experience the brutality and sadness--along with the joy and wonder--of surviving in a world that we don't control or understand.<br /><br />The Book Thief packs a strong emotional wallop (just try not to cry as you read the final 25 pages or so). It touches your heart and your mind, as all good art does.
1416955070|5.0|I started this book one weekend, and ended up finishing the whole series the next week.  I absolutely loved it!  As a fan of Twilight, I admit that I had low expectations for this series.  I thought it would be one of the many imitations in YA fiction right now.  It is not.  In fact, I enjoyed it more than Twilight.  The plot is more complex, and the characters certainly have more depth.  Simon and Isabelle are my favorite characters.  Although Simon is deeply in love with Clary, he does not allow her to take advantage of him.  Isabelle is conceited and cold, but deeply loyal to her family.  Even Jace is an unlikely hero.  He certainly has character traits that are most unbecoming.  It seems that Clary is the only somewhat predictable character--a young, innocent girl struggling with the reality of who she really is.    The author describes this fantasy world in great detail, and it's the kind of world you can easily get lost in while reading.  I can't wait to see more from this author and hope there's a new series in the works.
1416550542|5.0|Am reading The Forgotten Garden now and loving it.  It reminds me of reading a Catherine Cookson novel when she was at her peak.  I read (and probably own) every book that Catherine ever wrote and hope that Kate Morton continues to satisfy and surprise.  Thanks for a good old-fashioned intrigueing novel that makes me think.
B000EWD1KK|5.0|It's getting harder and harder to find movies by this great comedienne, actor, dancer and any other adjective that can describe the wonderful talents of Danny Kaye.  If you're a fan then this is a must have.  He bring the book to life.
B000BQPC3S|5.0|I never tire of watching this movie. So well cast and funny. I don't know who really is my favorite star, but it might have to be James Stewart in this one, although both Cary Grant and Katherine Hepburn are really good. A good supporting cast, also.
B001HNE3NO|3.0|I picked this book up as part of a book club read, and decided to leave a review, since it looks like everyone here enjoyed the book.  To begin, I liked the historical part of the book, and the way it was written from a little kid's view of the world during the war.  I was going to go on with the other things I liked, but I think that was it.  I did not like that the author wrote one chapter as present day, and the next as the past.  It made it hard to read continuously, like changing the channel every time a TV show gets good.  The present day woman she writes as flaunts her French (annoying if you do not know French), has a boring life, and husband she needs to be rid of, but keeps because he is a good lover.<br /><br />Honestly, half way through the book I started flipping screens (iPhone) just to find out what happened to the little girl.  And all of it is depressing.  Even the end of the book falls flat, and there is no satisfaction.  I would rather read about the event itself, then read this book.
B000EGFVQS|4.0|All in all, was very pleased with the transaction.  Book was as described and arrived in a timely manner.
B000002UA0|5.0|This is an amazing album. I have always been a fan of English music (in the Beatles, the only member of that band who didn't completely suck was John Lennon) and this is one of the greatest examples of how English bands easily beat all American bands. This is such an unconventional album and that's exactly why I love it! Songs like Astronomy Domine, Lucifer Sam, and Matilda Mother all have extremely silly lyrics but somehow I find them extremely intrigueing. In Astronomy Domine the band's fascination with space travel. I would recommend this album to any Pink Floyd fan as well as any fan of English music.    Just a response to something I read (I'm not going to use the name of the reviewer) but here it goes.    Screw you, Another Brick In the Wall (part two, you dumbass) was one of th greatest songs of all time. The line \\"We don't need no education\\" is refering to 'education' being beating the children into submission. In England they did and in some places still do beat te children (the teachers). If you'd bothered to listen to the previous song, \\"The Happiest Days of Our Lives\\" (which is often confused as being a part of Another Brick In the Wall Pt. 2, however it's its own song - buy the album-) you would have heard the lines. Here they are. Read them good.      The Happiest Days of Our Lives    When we grew up and went to school  There were certain teachers  Who would hurt the children any way they could    By pouring their derision  Upon anything we did  Exposing every weakness  However carefully hidden by the kid    But in the town it was well known  When they got home at night  Their fat, psychopathic wives  Would thrash them within inches of their lives    Another Brick In the Wall Pt. 2    (Scream)    We don't need no education  We don't need no thought control  No dark sarcasm in the classroom  Teacher leave them kids alone  Hey! Teacher! Leave them kids alone  All in all it's just another brick in the wall  All in all you're just another brick in the wallWe don't need no education  We don't need no thought control  No dark sarcasm in the classroom  Teachers leave those kids alone  Hey! Teacher! Leave us kids alone  All in all you're just another brick in the wall  All in all you're just another brick in the wall    Hope that clears everything up.
B002GZQY6Q|3.0|FOR ME THIS DISC IS JUST TO MOODY,SLOW,BORING AND SOFT SOUNDING,IT'S JUST NOT INTENSE OR HEAVY ENOUGH,LIKE SOME OF THERE STUFF FROM THE PAST WAS.THIS BAND NEEDS TO REGROUP AND BLEND A  BIGGER BETTER SOUND TOGETHER NEXT TIME,OR IT WILL BE LIGHTS OUT SOON FOR THESE GUYS.BEING AROUND FOR A LITTLE WHILE NOW.I WAS HOPING FOR A MUCH MORE ORIGINAL KICK ASS SOUNDING RECORD FROM THESE GUYS.BUT IT'S JUST NOT HERE>MAYBE NEXT TIME, LETS HOPE!
B001RTP3YQ|4.0|There was too much talking in between the number; more even than usually encountered in a live performance.  The music was as great as ever, including the newer numbers.  Nice mix.
B001DSNF8C|5.0|Contrary to what some reviews have said, both on Amazon and other sites like [...], there is a difference in the picture quality between the original Blu-Ray release and the 2 Disc Special Edition Blu-Ray release. The picture on the newer 2 Disc Special Edition has had some sort of re-digitizing and smoothing out. The difference is subtle, but definitely there. Some of the more noticeably grainy shots, like when Bond shoots the \\"one bombmaker\\", have been affected, although still a little grainy, but the cost of this has been to somewhat mute the colors and tones in the movie. Again, the difference is subtle, and to some, subjectively speaking, it may look better, especially if your HDTV and Blu-Ray player tend to really pump the colors. I personally like the original Blu-Ray release, with the strong colors and tones, and that \\"edgy\\" look, albeit, with several grainy spots. There is of course no denying the value of the Bonus disc in the 2 disc set, as well as the improved sound, although again, I personally like the more \\"edgier\\" sound on the original release, but to each his own. This is a great First Bond outing for Daniel Craig. A movie with depth, character development, and plenty of well shot action scenes. It is definitely a new direction for the Bond franchise, and a great way to start that transition, with a smart, \\"edgy\\" film that leaves you craving more.
0375842209|5.0|There is nothing I can say about the Book Thief that hasn't been said.  It is a book that must be read.  It touched me in a way that no other book about this time period has touched me.  I became part of the characters.  I cried, laughed and my heart broke; not only for them but for all who endured.  This is a book that deserves your time.
B000JMLFLW|5.0|This seems a somewhat redundant exercise reviewing a book that already stands as an English language classic and example of free indirect speech.  Even if most people could not necessarily recount the plot and characters, the countless editions of the book, combined with movies and literary spinoffs stand in testimony to it as a cultural icon.  There are not many who would not recognize the book by name and have some sense of its position and impact.<br /><br />This review then cannot do much more than to echo these commonly known facts and direct attention specifically to the Kindle edition of the book which was downloaded as a free public domain book and which I confess, my first time reading the entire book as originally written.  The strength of the book and timeless qualities of it can be affirmed by the attention that it elicited from me.  I was able to enter into the plot and see both the masterful writing as well as the true insight into human nature that this book represents.  Apart from a few typos and the chapters not being very well differentiated, I had little difficulty wanting to return to my Kindle to continue the read and glad for the experience.<br /><br />This is one of the most appealing elements of the Kindle in my estimation.  There are so many books in the public domain that provides an opportunity for the reader who has heard of and knows the place and importance of a particular book who can then download the book and take the opportunities during the day (and for me of a long commute) and fill the gaps in one's reading by pulling books that have stood the test of time as well as the convenience of the newer books that are available at a considerable discount over the new Hardback price.<br /><br />What a pleasure to read and more yet to come in the days ahead.<br /><br />5 Stars for the novel AND the medium!<br /><br />Bart Breen
B002NXPTDK|3.0|I thought this was suppose to be some \\"refreshing new rap/hip hop\\" and i was disappointed. I dont even listen to this album any more and i bought it around a month ago maybe. I only listen to Pursuit of Happiness and Day N Nite. Save your money and get only these two songs.
B002JM1VJG|2.0|Honest, what happened here? This is a great collection, I didn´t want to buy the dvd´s to wait for the blu-ray but no one knows anything about it, what is really weird is that warner strongly supports this format. Like someone else said, i also played it on an upscaled blu-ray player and lcd screen and the picture quality  is awful. Really, we´re in 2009 and i know of many people who has waited for this compilation. REMASTERED FROM ORIGINAL TAPES \\"I DON´T THINK SO!!!\\"
1932100660|3.0|Not sure why the title \\"China Study\\" was used as there is not a great deal written about the study itself.  I'd really expected to read about the variety of foods in various regions of China and their impact on health, weight, and fitness. I don't argue with the authors' promotion of a 'whole food, plant based' diet. A more accurate title would include that phrase - it was repeated enough in the book.
B000N6TYLW|3.0|Let's start by saying that i miss this show immensely still even after two years.  Without Amy Sherman Palladino, this show was obviously destined to end with this season.  Amy gave the show charm, wit and intellignece while Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel delivered it with warmth, style, grace and believability.  It's a shame that this show had to end with such disappointing episodes - don't get me wrong, Lauren, Alexis and the rest of the cast were absolutely wonderful, but there's no doubt in my mind that it would have been perfect if the Palladinos were behind these episodes.
B0015DROBO|5.0|I have read all 3 books in this trilogy and I enjoyed them all tremendously. You have to read them in order to get the best outcome. The story is different than normal Crime Novels, but the suspense is great and you can't put the books down.
B002C1BHIO|5.0|[[VIDEOID:38695321]]When it comes to HDMI cables, your cable either works or it doesn't. Since HDMI is digital, you don't have cables of varying signal qualities like older analog cables, which means that when considering which cable to buy, you'd be throwing your money away to choose the $80 gold plated super duper HDMI cables over a cheaper cable like this. Google \\"HDMI ripoff\\" and you'll see what I mean in more detail.<br /><br />As for this cable, it works! That's mostly what you'd want to know. It also has a nice-looking nylon braid around the cable itself, the only drawback being that it smells weird. It probably won't be a big problem when it's hooked up to your TV, but plug your nose when you open the box for the first time.<br /><br />Other than that, the best feature about this cable is Amazon's \\"frustration free\\" packaging, which is simply a recyclable cardboard box with a white label holding the side flap closed, then not much else. Open the box and there's no twist ties to unwind, no plastic to cut through. No wasteful eye-catching packaging, just the cable and a small paper note about the warranty! I like the idea of it! It's better for the environment and my sanity!

B002436WFI|1.0|Wow.  I don't know what to say, seeing all the reviews here stating what an enjoyable movie this is.  Quite frankly, it's terrible.  One of the worst movies I've seen in a long time, it brings back memories of old 80's movies about stupid stuff like swamp gators.  My wife and I sat through this very long movie last night, ...waiting the whole time for it to get started, with some sort of plot or theme, something!  This movie starts nowhere, stays nowhere and ends nowhere.  I would much prefer a cheap budget, low quality sci-fi channel movie that is badly done over this monstrously long movie that goes nowhere.  It's a shame really.  It could have been great.  The actors aren't bad, the filming isn't bad.  It's all the content, ...or lack of it, that's bad.  We left the movie asking ourselves \\"now, what was that about? Huh?\\".  I cannot recommend this movie to anyone.  Could have been a great family movie.  What a shame.
0545123267|3.0|I enjoyed this book well enough. It made for an enjoyable weekend read. SHIVER was, in a nutshell, a decent young adult novel that was compelling enough to hold my attention for the most part, but also a little too light for me.<br /><br />I'll start on a positive note and talk about what I did like:<br /><br />The atmosphere: The book sets an overall tone that worked decently throughout the book (except at certain points, which I'll talk about below). It's important for a fantasy to establish its own personality and this book's was a kind of burgeoning discovery, as something is just on the cusp of becoming more, something meaningful, but also a kind of loneliness that is looking to be fulfilled with something deeper. I found it to be a poignant and relatable way to house this book's world, given the genre.<br /><br />The lore: Werewolves have been told in various ways throughout the years, but I felt that Stiefvater's version was unique enough to feel refreshing. The sway of the seasons over the wolf/human forms instead of the moon was a nice turn about.<br /><br />Grace: She is a believable, sympathetic heroine. There is an otherworldliness that sets her apart appropriately from her closest friends as well as pretty much everyone else in town. The almost desolate isolation described above is for her. She's missing an even remotely caring parental unit, and she has taken over the role of adulthood to a point, what with cooking their meals. In a way she's like an adult in a teenager's body but she's not quite gained the balance necessary after the foal's been born. She's too consumed with searching for something that's haunted her for years and so she'll stumble a bit until she finds it.<br /><br />Sam: Sam's story unfolds a little less obviously for us than Grace's, which is no surprise given that he is the key to the book's otherworldly atmosphere. He's been a wolf for far less time than some of is pack, but he feels the pull of the winter more keenly now, threatening to keep him a wolf forever. To have this happen just as he finally meets Grace is cruel in the extreme, as his loneliness calls to hers, cancels it out and amps it into something more. Something both have felt as wolf eyes met human ones across the snow that divided them. Sam was refreshingly un-alpha, but certain enough of what he wanted to try as hard as he could to be with Grace. His particular story, especially of how he became a wolf and what it led to with his parents, was a much more compelling scenario than Grace with her parents. Sam's struggles to remain human were admirable.<br /><br />Certain moments: There were certain times with Grace and Sam that stood out, the time where she dances in her room, egging a smile on from Sam; and when they visit a small candy shop one evening when they decide to get out-of-town for a bit; and my favorite - when Sam reads some poetry to Grace on a date. There was a warmth that pervaded the book's overall lonely atmosphere and lifted up the spirit of the book, as if showing what life could be like for these two teens were things more normal. It was scenes like these that make a person believe in the impossible when everything is working so hard against a happily ever after for Grace and Sam. They are the parts that bring out the smiles.<br /><br />1st POV: The book gives Grace and Sam equal opportunity to be heard, which was great. Too often we get a good heroine or hero, but then we never hear what the other is thinking, instead relying solely on the 1st POV leader. With this one, we get alternating chapters of both Sam and Grace, with each chapter labeled with their name to make it a little easier to differentiate. I've read other books with this technique and I felt it worked great for SHIVER, even if I needed to refer back to the name on the chapter header from time to time.<br /><br />And what I didn't like or necessarily feel much for:<br /><br />The atmosphere: As much as I felt it contributed to the book overall, there were times when it was all a little too vague. I've felt like this while reading Marr's Wicked books, as if there is this annoying, wispy curtain clouding everything and if only I could sweep it aside to see what is going on clearly. It really is a lack of depth that I can't help but wish would have deepened, in the overall worldbuilding as well as in some of the character development. The whole book needed a punch, a kick to send it into overdrive.<br /><br />The parents: That same cloud of sorts is what contributed to my utter disbelief in Grace's parents, two people who are so self-absorbed that Grace can get away with what she does with Sam, and in their home no less. Never once do they look in on her with anything resembling parental concern. Both are too busy with lives outside the home to bother giving their daughter any real time and attention. And not just the kind that polices a kid's safety, but also the kind that fulfills a kid's need for love, which Grace was obviously missing and at one time still wanted from them. The parents never wake up, as if under some fairy tale spell that compels them to look away, not even when some obviously dangerous events begin to occur. Things were happening literally right beneath these people's noses too. Within the context of the book and its events, the parents were not believable and too easily pushed aside.<br /><br />Character development: While I liked Grace and Sam and felt they served the roles they were given adequately, I kept wishing to delve more into them and have them push aside that wispy curtain I found so annoying. Character development never quite reached a level where I felt they were beyond what is described in the back cover blurb. Why were they attracted to one another so long ago, with her a young girl and him a wolf? What is the world made him save her? What did he see in her eyes and she in his? We're led to believe it's something profound yet it's never really addressed, only instead presented as a given. In fact, that wispy cloud enables many points in the book to feel like a given as opposed to moving beyond that and solidifying it with some development.<br /><br />The ending: Quite simply, it was achieved too easily and left with too may questions overall.<br /><br />I think any problems I had may be due to the fact that this is the first in a series. I talk sometimes about a balance that needs to be achieved for a first in a new series. I don't feel the balance was quite achieved for me. I am intrigued enough to see what happens in the sequel, LINGER (Fall 2010), and given the sequel's long wait time, it's almost a relief not to be foaming at the mouth for it now.<br /><br />The writing, however, is lovely, with a leisurely, strolling pace that was perfect for a day of reading. Not overly complex or particularly deep, SHIVER seems to promise more out of what was at least an interesting series beginning. It is a hopeful promise that subsequent books will be more engaging and pack a more meaningful punch.this while reading Marr's Wicked books, as if there is this annoying, wispy curtain clouding everything and if only I could sweep it aside to see what is going on clearly.

B002MTTZ5I|5.0|First things first, Feel the Steel is a masterpiece.  An instant classic.  This is the best metal CD to grace the earth in decades.    The members of Steel Panther (fka Danger Kitty, Metal Shop, and Metal Skool) have been cutting their teeth in the biz since the late 80s, working their butts off to catch the break that the best known L.A. bands were able build lasting careers from.  Ralph (vocals) and Russ (guitar) played in a Van Halen cover band for years and earned national attention with the skill and dedication they put into making the show so true to the original.  Later, Ralph recorded a CD with the sinking ship that was the 1990s-era L.A. Guns.  While they were always part of the scene, they never hit it big time... until now.    Sure, there is a satirical element to the whole shtick if you want there to be.  Call it Spinal Tap, Fozzy, whatever.  Steel Panther sells their fictitious back story well, and if you wish to embrace that aspect of the band and their stage-name alter-egos like I do, this band is an experience on a whole different level.  I am fortunate enough to have been a part of their live show, and it was one of the finest concert-going experiences of my life.  These guys are as genuine, passionate, and humble as you will find in the industry.    Even if you choose to ignore the satire, Feel the Steel is still an unbelievable stand-alone album by its own merits.  The musicianship is second to none, the production is top notch, and the metal is relentless as you pick out riffs and hooks reminiscent of every glam band from Bon Jovi to Ratt to Whitesnake.  You're doing yourself a complete disservice if you buy into the negative reviews and write this one off as some sort of 80s metal parody.  These songs are destine to be classics, and will stick in your head for a long, long time.    Critics will throw out terms like \\"juvenile\\" and \\"toilet humor\\".  Yes, I'll admit...this album is pretty filthy.  If you're easily offended or only want feel-good power ballads, this probably won't be for you.  But those who hear references to cottage cheese thighs and reproductive fluid emissions and see how it all fits into the celebration of the excess referred to as \\"sex, drugs, and rock n' roll\\" will become bigger fans with every replay.  There are just so many levels of genius at work with this 11-song masterpiece that the written word will never do it justice.   Growing up a huge fan of Motley, Guns, Poison, and so forth, I couldn't recommend it more.
0312360258|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. It's such an improvement over the Twilight series by Stephenie Meyer. These vampyres are darker and much more interesting than sparkly vegetarian vamps!<br /><br />The vampyres in P.C. and Kristin Cast's first House of Night novel remind me a bit of the vampires in Charlaine Harris's Southern Vampire series. Harris's vampires tell the world that vampirism is caused by a virus. The Casts's vampyres begin their Change as teenagers, when hormones are raging. Scientists aren't exactly sure what causes the Change, but link it to the high levels of teenage hormones.<br /><br />Zoey Redbird is a typical teenager at her Oklahoma high school. She's having to deal with a football player boyfriend who has started to drink excessively, which she doesn't care for. Her best friend talks more than she listens. Then she gets Tracked and Marked by a vampyre Tracker, which means she has to get to the House of Night as soon as possible or she'll die.<br /><br />Zoey's mother and step-father are narrow-minded religious nuts. Her grandmother, however, is supportive and helps Zoey get to the House of Night in time.<br /><br />Zoey stands out as different immediately, because instead of a fledgling outline, her Mark is filled in. She meets her roommate and several others who become her good friends. She also meets a fifth former, a High Priestess in training, who becomes her nemesis.<br /><br />While Zoey is confused and frightened by her new life, she isn't a whiner (unlike another female protagonist I could name). She begins to discover her unusual abilities. She also comes to realize that some of her friends in her former life weren't the friends she thought they were.<br /><br />It didn't take me long to finish Marked. It's well-written and held my interest from start to finish. I'm looking forward to reading the next House of Night novel.

0307346617|2.0|Warning this book is political! Collectivism at its finest...    If you have a difficult time at letting go of your political beliefs while immersing yourself in a novel, then do not read this book(unless you are a collectivist). Brooks has allowed his leftist or collectivist political bias to spoil this book IMO. Example, he acknowledges that the US has more guns than people, but the US fared NO better than the rest of the world. Note: It only takes one round in the head to kill the slow moving Zombie. -- Brooks just couldn't let the gun toting  US citizen take care of himself. Things only got better at the hands of a Constitution-less joint UN/US government.     This theme of government being good, individuals being helpless, worthless and having no rights - gets old. But, After all this is an emergency!  This theme runs throughout the book. It was just plain irritating. Especially after the secessionist \\"rebels\\" had fought off zombie attacks for years and years without any outside help. And then Government finally shows up only to destroy them since the zombies couldn't - They say they were traitors, self reliant, just plain evil. It was for the common good, don't you know? They had to go. (Roll eyes here)    Other than Mr.Brooks' political bias, I really enjoyed this book.
B000TUXL2A|2.0|unfortunately MK`s Kill to get Crimson is the continuation of ragpicker`s and shangri-la...all the exciting, soulful electric playing is gone and we are left with folk numbers that work great on an autumn afternoon but will make you drowsy any other time of the year. Luckily there is plenty of great music by our Mark such as the criminally underrate On every street, check that one out if you like his softer side

B001AVCFJM|2.0|Sorry, but they took 43 years of history and erased it all.  What they replaced it with was attractive but also one-dimensional and shallow.  Star Wars was the show about action.  Star Trek was the one about science and character interplay.  All they did with this one was turn Star Trek into a Star Wars...and an inferior one at that.  I'm giving it two stars because it was attractive and was something that maybe would have been OK as a different franchise.  I took away the rest for abandoning so much history and turning something so iconic and significant into something so shallow.

1579128149|5.0|The Elements by Theodore Gray is a must-have book for anyone who has ever wondered just what exactly the world is made of. That includes curious kids as well as adults with even a passing interest in nature, science and technology. The luscious photographs in this coffee table size book will captivate even young elementary students, while the surprising, witty, non-technical text will keep even professional chemists and engineers entertained and informed.     I opened my newly received copy late at night, intending to look at a few pages before bed. I literally could not put it down, and read it straight through from hydrogen to element 118, so newly discovered it doesn't even have a name yet. Each element's vignette smoothly segues into the next, so it works like an old radio serial melodrama - you just have to keep reading to find out what happens next!    Each element is covered in its order in the periodic table. Along with the multiple photos of pure elements and common (matches and nails) and exotic (atomic clocks and lasers) things containing them from Gray's extensive museum quality collection, you will learn trivia about ones you know well (aluminum, a metal so precious that Napoleon preferred it to gold for VIP dinnerware, is now thrown in the garbage after wrapping sandwiches); ones you might remember from high school (poisonous bromine is in every can of Orange Crush); and ones you probably never heard of (you are required by law to put radioactive americium in every one of your children's bedrooms, and you have!) Lovely diagrams show the electronic configuration, color spectrum and crystal shape. Melting and boiling point bars at the page margins cleverly form a graphic demonstration of the elements' periodic properties when the book is fanned open.    Objects pictured and discussed come from a wide variety of fields including painting, agriculture, medicine, aviation, numismatics, ancient history, warfare, popular culture, computers, jewelry and more.For a fine art work of this size and quality, the price is ridiculously inexpensive. The high resolution photographs which fill each element's double page spread are printed on a deep black background, and seem to jump out of the page into your hands. You will find out why you might not want this to happen with arsenic or polonium.    The Elements will enhance your appreciation of the stuff the stars, the planets and we ourselves are made of, and make the universe, and your bookshelf, a more beautiful place.
B002PAQB2O|5.0|This is, of course a glorious book, however this Kindle version is full of typographical errors.  It needs a serious editing!
0439023491|5.0|How can I not like anything that's the sequel to the Hunger Games? For that reason alone, I really enjoyed reading Catching Fire. But Collins has again delivered a suspenseful, well-written novel with characters that jump off of the page. So that's why I LOVE Catching Fire!<br /><br />Collins returns to some very familiar ground from the last book, but I don't mind in the slightest. She explores District Twelve and its residents in greater depth, so the reader can really get a feel for the place where Katniss has lived all of her life. And then *whispers* in the later part of the book she brings back an event from the first book, which is just as beautifully inventive and suspenseful as the first time. *finishes trying to avoid spoilers* And the love triangle heats up, as Gale and Peeta vie for Katniss's attentions.<br /><br />Ooh and I really liked the new villain, President Snow. He's fittingly creepy, and when Collins describes his smell as that of \\"roses and blood\\" it makes my stomach turn. It's like he's rotten underneath but he's trying to mask it. I think that's just like the Capitol.<br /><br />I am so happy that Colins continued describing the lavishness of the Capitol. The tantalizing food descriptions and the gorgeous outfits that readers will remember from The Hunger Games continue in Catching Fire, and they are some of my favorite parts of the book.<br /><br />I also enjoyed the introduction of more political elements , with the Districts churning with rebellious ideas and Katniss and Peeta the *possible* (willing or no) leaders of an uprising.<br /><br />Throughout the book, I found myself amazed by how inventive and well-thought out the book was: especially the technology, customs of the Capitol, and most of all the past Hunger Games that Katniss will learn about. I mean, when we find out how Haymitch won his round of the Hunger Games, I literally stopped reading and thought to myself, \\"WOW. How did she ever think of that?\\" I had several more moments like that throughout the book.<br /><br />I'm still mulling over certain aspects of the book in my head. I've decided I like the ending, but I can't help feeling that the first two books were almost like episodes in a TV show where they say, \\"HAHAHA To Be Continued\\" right when you're anxious to know what's going to happen next. There's bold print on the last page titled \\"End of Book Two\\" but I did not expect the book to end right there, right when all these new revelations and issues have surfaced. But hey, what am I complaining about? That just means that there's going to be more sequels. Yippee!like that throughout the book.<br /><br />I'm still mulling over certain aspects of the book in my head.

B0000VCZK2|5.0|I love all 4 of the movies. The way the storyline follows the experince of one brave woman. It's great! The action, aliens, and stuff had me glued to the TV. I would tell everybody if they like syfy and action get these movies.  Sheila
0545123267|4.0|I think Maggie Stiefvater is a wonderful writer. She's particularly strong in descriptions--some of them in the book were just plain beautiful, the kinds that you go back over to read again and marvel at.    I also thought it was really interesting to have the werewolves change due to temperature. It's something I've never heard before; a refreshing take on werewolf mythology.    However, I felt like the book was a bit slow moving. I don't know why--it's just that I've never been one for pages and pages of pure romance. And while I was reading Shiver, I kept getting this tingly feeling down my spine that I'd read this story before. It's plotline is remarkably similar to Twilight-- girl falls in love with supernatural being that ,stalks, ahem, protects her. But Shiver is certainly a work within it's own right--and an impressive one at that. I can certainly understand why it's becoming so popular.    Sam, with his yellow eyes and penchant for composing song lyrics, is adorable. Grace is a suitably strong heroine and isn't one to be swept off of her feet. She's no blubbering weakling, that's for certain. The first time she and Sam kiss, she asks \\"Is that all you got?\\" Which is a nice change from all the fainting romance heroines have been doing lately.    I loved how the story was narrated from two points of view--Grace and Sam. But I found myself having to flip back every chapter to find out which one was narrating. Both accounts had the exact same voice, even though one was told by a teenage girl and the other by a werewolf boy.    But I can forgive that since Shiver was a great read. I'm not as crazy about it as many of the people who've read it, I think it's more a case of personal taste. Upon reflection, I can certainly see it's merits and I'm not surprised at all that many readers are in love with it. And I'm sure it's going to be the next big series, so get ready for the ride. I wonder who's going to star as Sam in the movie.
B0000542D2|1.0|A Hard Day's Night is my all time favorite movie, but when I tried to watch it on my DVD player that usually plays the complete disk it stopped in the middle of the movie right out of the box! This is disappointing. Haven't had a chance to try it on another DVD player. Maybe next time I'll bite the bullet and buy the Apple version.
0385504225|2.0|I am a fan of Dan Brown but this book was boring and I am totally unamused and underwhelmed.  I got to Chapter 20 waiting with baited breathe for something groundbreaking or earthshattering to happen and really jumpstart this story, it didn't so I took the book and respectfully placed it on my bookshelf until the day I can make time to drive to the local library and donate it.  Don't waste your time reading 600 pages of a story that was told better 2 novels ago.
B00009UW0N|4.0|If you do not know what this film is about, let me sum it up for you: all slasher films that followed owe their structure and theme to this movie.  Few have matched it in its intensity, pacing, and overall quality.  Although modern audiences may find it slow and plodding (and the acting isn't very good, either), if people watch it knowing what it is, and taking it for what it is, they can develop an appreciation for a subgenre that quickly fell into irrelevancy within a few short years.<br /><br />This film launched Carpenter's mainstream career.  He would focus mostly on supernatural or extraterrestrial horror in his subsequent efforts, but few films manage to capture the sheer feeling of dread that The Shape's brief onscreen appearances instill in a willing audience.  Turn the lights off and transport yourself back to a late-seventies drive-in, and you will not be disappointed.<br /><br />The picture and audio quality is superb.  The second set of special features makes it worth the extra cost.  Check out HALLOWEEN II if you like this one, but avoid the other sequels (H20 isn't that bad, but everything else is).  Ignore Rob Zombie's remakes.
B001CTDH76|5.0|I must said, i love this show. The story is good, and the cast is amazing. Some people had compare it with Psych, while i admit they are close similar but they are different.. to me, Psych is more comedic in nature (believe me, i own Psych too) but The Mentalist offer more mature side (in terms of characters, i suppose) to the audience.    I will especially praise the packaging, as it looks excellent! It is truly a 'collectible' packaging, if compare with those cheap packaging but insane pricing dvds. Keep up the good packaging, i will definitely keep on buying for the season to come!
B000002UYZ|5.0|I wished it had included Penny Lane, but that was on Magical Mystery Tour (1967) - Other than that, it's pretty excellent for a remaster/compilation! I did, however, get MMT album. Not just for the one song that was missing, but to replace my vinyl copy. The only real negative is the quality of the midrange. Some of the cuts sound a bit tinny to me. Not as \\"round and smooth\\" as the old vinyl, but the clarity somewhat makes up for that. I've heard details in this copy that I have never noticed before! All cuts are originals that have been digitally remastered. NOT second cuts, and not rough pressings as far as I can tell. I've heard some poor reproductions of other artists before and this is not like that. These are the real thing...no \\"first takes\\" or radically remixed disasters in the bunch...Yay! Until now I have not had any Beatles to play in my car on the way to and from work. I'm so happy with this CD set I keep an MP3 copy in my car at all times.

0385513755|4.0|A really good read.  I bought it because I read the regular edition and wanted to see all the symbolism for myself.  I am glad I did.  I would suggest this book for any one who wants to live the book in pictures.

B002PY86WI|5.0|I  prefer the radio versions of her hits over the album versions. Particularity,some of the singles from like a prayer.I was disappointed to hear that she left off alot of her ballads, like You'll see, This used to be my playground, and What it feels like for a girl.What it feels like for a girl was a big hit for her. There is alot of material that's  been left off,but then again she's constently had 3 decades where she's only had 1 or 2 flop albums.  Overall,Madonna is the queen of pop. She's been alot bigger the Michael Jackson over the past few years. And she didnt get her self mixed up in drugs or drama like whitney, mariah, or paula abdul for that matter.She's been consistent.And it seems like she's works really hard when shes on tour. her projects also get really hyped up. To me most of these songs are classic, Like a Virgin, Holiday, Express Yourself, and Vogue are some of my favorites. So i can't complain there. Also, can i say gotta love the cover work? This should have been the album cover art instead of the tacky hard candy cover. Plus the two new tracks are pretty kick butt. Revolver is agreat uptempo song. Reminds me of something the pussycat dolls or Britney spears would, which is what i love about madonna, she always tries to do something new. Ceebration is classic madonna, and ive always like Paul Okenfolds music. SO im glad they teamed up together. This is  more of what madonna should have done last year instead of the timbaland crap that came out. Overall this is a great collection,and everybody should def, buy this 2 disk set.
B0025KVLT2|5.0|All Beatles ablums had shown progression from their predecessors, but 'Rubber Soul' represented a significant creative leap, both musically and lyrically. The Beatles begin to push the boundaries of pop and rock, incorporating jazz, folk-rock, soul, and World Music influences. Nearly every song features unusual arrangements or instrumentation (piano, organ, harmonium, fuzz bass, sitar, French lyrics, Greek-style guitar lines), and a clear development in vocal technique (particularly harmonies) is obvious. Lyrically, the band begin to move beyond boy/girl themes, most obviously in 'Nowhere Man' and the proto-hippie 'The Word'. But even those songs that are still based on relationships deal with the issue in a more mature and sophisticated way, expressing at different times uncertainty, longing, frustration, humiliation or thinly-vieled sexual suggestion. 'Rubber Soul' is the sound of The Beatles growing up.    'Drive My Car': jazzy piano-driven opener turns the traditional boy/girl dynamic on its head. An excellent, slightly raw, performance from McCartney on vocals, with excellent support from the others on harmony.     'Norwegian Wood': famous for the incorporation of Harrison's sitar, which suits this folky song so well it's hard to imagine anything else taking its place. The significance of the music sometimes means Lennon's quite controversial lyrics (which again reverse the traditional relationship dynamic) are overlooked. A key track in the Fab Four's development.    'You Won't See Me': proof that McCartney is just as capable as Lennon at writing songs expressing uncertainty and doubt. Superb call-and-response harmonies in the chorus and bridge.    'Nowhere Man': folk-influenced song notable for being the first Beatle song to move beyond relationships entirely. Also possibly one of Lennon's first forays into social commentary, although his lyrics are more sympathetic than scathing. Possibly the best and most developed harmonies on the album.    'Think For Yourself': by far the weaker of the two Harrison songs. After the maturity of the first four songs, this throwback to more traditional boy/girl themes seems dated and even a bit misogynistic. The fuzz bass is good, but probably makes the song seem more interesting than it actually is.    'The Word': another song to move beyond relationships, as Lennon exults about \\"The word...Love!\\" in its more abstract sense. Yet another song to feature very clever vocal harmonies and shifts. Note also the heavy distortion and effects applied to both piano and guitars, and the swirling organ during the bridge clearly anticipates the psychedelia of the following year.     'Michelle': McCartney ballad in the mould of 'Yesterday', the song expresses hope, longing and uncertainty. Notable for its liberal use of French lyrics.    'What Goes On': country-tinged rocker sung and partially composed by Ringo. His deadpan, slightly mournful vocals suit the song's \\"what have I done to deserve being treated like this?\\" theme.    'In My Life': one of Lennon's best songs, part-autobiography and part-love song, as he notes that none of his past associates compare to his current companion. Famous for featuring a piano sped up to sound like a harpsichord during the bridge.     'I'm Looking Through You': expresses similar sentiments to 'You Won't See Me' but with a harder edge musically and lyrically. The tension and urgency in the lyrics is emphasised by sharp harmonium stabs at the end of each verse.    'Girl': arguably the most mature song here, as Lennon laments a girl who seems to take sadistic pleasure in humiliating her lovers. Sung in a very world-weary, resigned fashion, complete with heavy sighs. Incorporates elements of Greek music, most obviously on the instrumental bridge.    'Wait': this was a 'Help!' out-take and it shows, as it's clearly the simplest song here. A bit of a throwaway compared to other songs on the album, but pleasant enough.    'If I Needed Someone': the first George Harrison gem. Driven by a simple but beautiful guitar riff and featuring exquisite harmonies, this is one of the highlights of the album, and a clear demonstration of Harrison's development as a songwriter.    'Run For Your Life': another song Lennon disowned, perhaps because of its relatively simplistic lyrics. However, like 'You Can't Do That', Lennon uses the macho posturing as a means to disguise a deep insecurity. One of the more conventional rock songs here, it's quite a forceful way to close the album.     Both 'We Can Work It Out' and 'Day Tripper' were also recorded during these sessions. Both songs match the development on display here, and both would have fitted well on the album.     'Rubber Soul' represents a turning point in The Beatles' sound, and also to an extent their image. While still recognisable as being the work of the Fab Four, the album's more ambitious tracks clearly point the way forward to the more radical experimentation of 'Revolver' and 'Sgt Pepper'. A key, essential part of The Beatles catalogue.
B00026WU64|5.0|If you are a true Bob Dylan fan, Freewheeling Bob Dylan is a must.  I already have it on a record but it is well-worn and I just can't lose these songs.  I already have the 3 CD compilation set 'Biography' which has the most well know songs from this CD on it.  Unfortunately, it doesn't include 'The Talking World War 3 Blues' and 'I Shall Be Free'.  These are some of his great comic songs with wonderful, imaginative lyrics that paint hilarious pictures in your mind.  I also have many of his other albums which I love too but 'Freewheeling' will always be my favorite. Also HOW I got the original 'Freewheeling' record I'll never forget.  In high school I traded another kid a 'Jan and Dean' album of surfer boy songs for it. ha!! We both left the transaction thinking we got the best of the other one. So to my high school friend Donald, wherever you are: SUCKER!!  ha, ha.    If you are really a Bob Dylan fan, trust me, Don't miss adding 'The Freewheeling Bob Dylan' to your collection.
B0007PALZ2|4.0|Science Fiction with time travel and deadly world of germs actually keeps your attention.  This is a film that features Bruce Willis (as time traveler from the year 2035)  and Brad Pitt (an insane son of a rich influential scientist).<br /><br />The movie works on all fronts despite a bizarre plot.  Terry Cole (Bruce Willis) is a prisoner in the year 2035, where all earthlings must live underground to escape a deadly plague on the earth's surface.  Terry is asked to travel back in time to the month before the germs were released and try to change the future.  He ends up in a insane asylum in 1990 the first trip.  His psychiatrist, Katherine Railly and a friendly inmate Jeffrey Goines (Brad Pitt) are his main contacts and he feels that they may help him find the clues to the epidemic that killed 5 billion people in 1997.<br /><br />Original intrigue keeps the audience interested and involved with the surprise ending.  Food for thought in our time of worry about pandemics.
B000VDBD6Q|5.0|Got the book in a timely manner, and the book's condition was exactly as decribed.
B002KQ6BT6|1.0|It is true my expectations were high after Angels and Demons and Da Vinci Code , but oh my god. It felt like a poor attempt at a book at best. It is a screenplay for the movie that I'm sure will follow. Is is not a novel. It definitely has its twists and turns but they make absolutely no sense.     Da Vinci Code was trully inspiring. It was able to shake people minds and that what makes a book great. Lost Symbol is a waste of time and money. Movie is going to be a much better experience.     It is sad to see what happens to writers once they achieve financial success. They become pupperts of the movie industry executives.
1597801577|5.0|I had never heard of this author and picked the work up after reading the dust jacket.    As it happens I had just finished (barely) River of Gods by Ian McDonald, which to my mind attempts the same sort of concept.  Set a near future story in a stand-alone foreign culture, bringing the reader both through the story and through the culture.  River of Gods flirts with greatness but ultimately collapses under its own weight in attempting to teach us all about India.    Windup Girl is everything good SF should be, along with some great elements we don't always see in SF.  The pacing is great, the story is accessible on many levels and the characters are relatable.  The story doesn't talk down to you, or drown you in minutia proving how clever the author is.  It makes you think, it makes you feel.  It made me want more.
B001MEJY8W|5.0|France, 1971: Battered minor, Lucie Jurin (Mylène Jampanoï), is found wandering the streets after apparently escaping a sustained period of confinement and sadistic and systematic torture at the hands of mysterious captors whose motives remain unknown. Luci becomes a ward of the state and a resident of an orphanage where she befriends Anna (Morjana Alaoui), who slowly brings her back from a state of near catatonia to something like a sense of normality, despite the fact that Lucie is repeatedly visited and attacked by a nightmarish spectral figure who seems to be capable of inflicting actual physical harm upon her.    Fifteen years later, the Belfonds, an affluent family of French suburbanites, are settling down to breakfast when there is a knock at the door...unbeknownst to them, they are about to cross paths with an older and progressively more unhinged Lucie Jurin and before the day is done, they will understand the true meaning of obsession...    To go into further detail of the events that occur in Pascal Laugier's \\"Martyrs\\" would be to rob the potential viewer ot the twists and turns of one of the most compulsive horror films of recent years. Whilst the film bears a vague similarity in tone to the \\"Grand Guignol\\" genre mined by the likes of \\"Saw\\" and \\"Hostel\\", to write it off as just another lurid exercise in torture and sadism is to do it a major disservice. Laugier himself has described it as the \\"Anti-[[ASIN:B000EHQU3U Funny Games]]\\" and it is a fair statement. It is the complete antithesis of Michael Haneke's detached, voyeuristic observation of the torture and murder of an Austrian family. There is no detachment here - as a viewing experience, it is visceral, shocking, emotionally draining and unremittingly brutal; but there is also a shockingly touching element of humanity which runs throughout the narrative. As a film it also goes off on tangents which are completely unpredictable and which are so cleverly plotted and paced that you cannot help but concede that you are in the hands of a cinematic master of suspense. It's genre-defying stuff. And in common with its predecessors and contemporaries in the French 'survival horror film' genre, [[ASIN:B000ARFPMQ High Tension (Unrated Widescreen Edition)]] and [[ASIN:B0014VPFVS Frontier(s)]] it is, at it's heart, a film about how personal obsession can become so all-encompassing that it destroys lives. However, unlike those films, \\"Martyrs\\" is also a film about attempting to force personal redemption and spiritual epiphany as well as the lengths to which a person will go to protect someone that they love.      Make no mistake - this is bleak, nihilistic stuff which has more in common with the likes of Gaspar Noe's brilliant [[ASIN:B00009W0U4 Irreversible]] than Eli Roth's \\"Hostel\\" (and in common with Noe's film, the overwhelming emotion that I was left with as the final credits ran was of a profound sense of sadness and loss).     This is not the best horror film of the 2008 - for me, personally, that accolade still goes to the very different, but similarly transcendent, \\"Let The Right One In\\" -  but it runs a very, very close second and is a film that I recommend unreservedly for those that can stomach its harsh vision.
B000001ELD|5.0|while there's no denying that ACE'S solo was the best. PAUL'S was a rock album much like the stuff he has done with KISS.PETER even had his audience and while he's talented,he seems more obsessed with trying to write another BETH.GENE'S album ran the gament. stuff that could have been on a KISS album and some stuff that would never be a KISS album. that's why his was always my favorite.
B002R9USD6|4.0|Enjoying the show, downloads to my hard drive so there is no pausing during viewing. If you like Vampire stories this one's pretty good.
B000001ELF|5.0|this is one of the best solo albums anyone ever associated with KISS has done. ace plays lead,rhythm,accoustic and bass guitars on every song. a talented player with a lot of promise(in 78). i bought all 4 solo albuns the day they came out and there's no denying that ace's was the best. i always liked gene's the best. but that's just my personal preference.
B002KLAL4W|5.0|Pearl Jam's ninth studio album is also their shortest to date, but more importantly it's a combination of everything they've achieved up to this point. \\"Just Breathe\\" and \\"The End\\" evolved out of Vedder's solo album Into the Wild, \\"Force of Nature\\" sounds like a good outtake from the Vs./Vitalogy era, \\"The Fixer\\" brims with the optimism of Yield, \\"Amongst the Waves\\" recalls the anthemic sound of their first album, while  the opening crunch of \\"Gonna See My Friend\\" could have appeared on almost any one of their albums. They've also gone in heretofore unexplored territory with the almost New Wave sound of \\"Got Some\\" and the oddly beautiful \\"Speed of Sound.\\" If you've come this far with the band and have enjoyed most of what Pearl Jam has done in the past, I think you'll enjoy Backspacer.
0316066524|5.0|Infinite Jest first struck me with its 'maximumist'  style of prose. No thought, feeling or physical detail is ever left unsaid. This turned me off at first and it took some time for me to actually start enjoying the book. But suddenly the surface broke, or the corner was turned, and I was swallowed up by the story. The 'maximumist' style, once adjusted to, makes you experience the book as if you are the characters. This is generally said about most good fiction, but Infinite Jest is that art at its pinnacle. It's almost like being possessed!    Infinite Jest is somewhat like how Wallace describes drug rehabilitation in the book: when one walks into an A.A. meeting it is immediately disliked and uncomfortable. The more the addict keeps coming, however, the more it transforms from being the worst thing to the best thing in his life; which is the exact opposite of the drug they are trying to kick -- the drug is immediately loved and easy, but progressively becomes the worst thing in the addict's life. Infinite Jest is a steep upward curve of enjoyment and learning until you are left gutted that it ended.     There is one footnote in it that goes for eighteen pages! And that footnote has footnotes! Again, this was annoying at first, since all the footnotes are at the back of the book (and with a 1000 or so page brick like this you don't want to have to keep running from the back to the front). But this became something like a board game where I excitedly searched in the back for the next plot clue (yes, much of the plot's most important information is in the footnotes!).    For those interested in issues like depression and suicide, Infinite Jest contains the best description I've ever read of how it feels to be suicidal -- and Wallace is unfortunately an authority, as we all now know.    The book is about tennis, film-making, terrorism and drug rehab, plus where/how all those things fit into the rest of the Universe. It's both hilarious and deeply metaphysical. I really love tennis now. Buy the book.
B002QXT7XK|3.0|The original Stargate, SG!, and its spinoff, Stargate Atlantis, were pure entertainment with some elements of drama thrown into the mix. The casting for both those series were amazing. If the creators and producers were so anxious to get back to the franchise, I don't know why they did not continue with Stargate Atlantis another three to five years . . . unless, as seems obvious, they were anxious try something totally different, which they do not. And that is the inherent problem with Stargate Universe. They don't fully commit to this new darker version of Stargate. They have regurgitated many of the stock characters, but devoid of the old humor these characters are boring and one dimensional. Eli, the math whiz who unknowingly solves their energy problem, is a very poor contrivance. They should have steered clear of the brilliant gamer being drafted by the government. When they pulled a similar stunt with Rodney's sister, Genie, it was done much more artfully.     And while I love Richard Dean Anderson ad Amanda Tapping, I think they should have had faith in the old franchise, and the devoted fans of that franchise by also steering clear of any of their characters to introduce us to new characters, as well any of the old gags (i.e. characters who like to name unknown things) or iconic references . . . such as Eli's silly reference to The Planet of the Apes. In another show, say SG1 or Stargate Atlantis, it would have been funny. It does not work here    I think the idea of a darker Stargate was an excellent one, but when the producers hired the writers and the actors they should have been thinking Battlestar Galactica meets the science of the Stargate, but without nothing of the old franchise in sight, except the Stargate technology.    Stargate Universe comes off as a humorless imitation of its two brilliant predecessors, and it lacks serious dramatic story lines and great actors. The one known actor, Lou Diamond Phillips, is made to look a buffoon. He is a solidactor, and they give him a second rate part in preference to second rate actors.    If this show makes it, it will only be due to the loyalty of hardcore SG1 fans.
140120841X|5.0|This novel, while slightly confusing in the beginning, accurately and beautifully depicts what is being told in the written text of the novel.  At times, it is difficult to decipher exactly what the plot is, but all is revealed pages later.      Overall, it is artistically stunning, and a wonderful story.  Bravo!
B001E1DJD4|5.0|One of the most impressive artists I've had the privilege of discovering recently, Rachel Yamagata has the ability to chill my bones while warming my heart; and she does it effortlessly.  With a sound reminiscent of Fiona Apple (yes, the comparisons are justified), a haunting fragrance comparable to Poe (got to love that) and the soulfulness of Ray Lamontagne (who even duets with her on `Duet'!!!), Rachel Yamagata has her style, and her fan base, practically carved out for her already; but what makes Rachel so special is that she exceeds all expectations by making each and every track her own, never falling into copycat territory or resting easy on the coattails of those who paved the way for her.  With the voice of an angel (a fallen angel, beings that the hint of smoke and whiskey rule out a heavenly hope) and the fearlessness needed to stand out in the industry, Rachel Yamagata is one of the best musical talents you've never heard of.<br /><br />Now you have.<br /><br />`Elephants' starts off the album with a bold and blunt outlook from this fragile looking creature.  Her outer beauty is offset by her inner melancholy; both facets of her person elevating the other to create something truly beautiful to comprehend.  Speaking of haunted past lives and blood-soaked jaws, Yamagata paints a vivid picture that one will not soon forget; and the instrumental version that appears in the center of the album only brings those memories back to life, full force.  `Sunday Afternoon' may seem daunting at nearly ten minutes long, but don't be afraid; the track never wanes and is one of the best on the album.  With a delicate introduction that leads way to a robust center, warming up to a fragile conclusion, `Sunday Afternoon' is a brilliant track that is the definition of a `full circle' or `complete' song.  `Little Life' explodes with effervescent beauty at about the 2:15 point.  That isn't to say that the song isn't beautiful before that, but it takes on another life.  `Over and Over' soars with the use of the piano, and instrument that, in all its beauty, is the perfect vehicle for melancholy expressions.  Rachel soaks into this fantastic ballad, creating a major standout on a record filled to the brim with standouts.  It reminded me a lot of something off of Damien Rice's albums; something simple yet so rich with character.<br /><br />`Duet' is one of the most beautiful songs I've ever heard, and the pairing of Yamagata and Lamontagne was pure genius; providing us something pure, genuine and sincere.<br /><br />`What if I Leave' has a nice laid back feel to it, with soft vocals and simple musical accompaniment.  `Horizon' isn't as long as `Sunday Afternoon', but it feels longer due to the fact that it isn't as stunning or as engaging.  It's still a good song, and it possesses Rachel's beautiful delivery, but it just doesn't have the sparkle I was expecting.  That said; `Brown Eyes' is my least favorite track on Disc 1.  It just feels out of place for me, slightly distant and awkward.<br /><br />The best track is the hidden track, `The Only Fault'.  It's a brilliant composition of chilling reality and beautiful fantasy; exposing Rachel at her most impressive.  Lyrically it is tragically beautiful, and the simple delivery is so much more complex than one might initially expect.  It is much more difficult to remain engaging and poignant in sheer delicacy that it is to attempt to dazzle with large amounts of `talent'.  Her voice brings to mind the delicate vocal stylings of Leslie Feist; gorgeous.<br /><br />Disc 2 starts things off with the marvelous `Sidedish Friend'; a spunky and energetic number that is a breath of fresh air on the rather down-tempo album.  Sadly, the rest of the Disc lacks the `full' robust flavor of the opening stunner.  `Accident' tries, but it falls a little short.  It has edge, but the edge lacks the `pop' that `Sidedish Friend' capitalized off of.  It's a good song, but it isn't `great'.  `Faster' incorporates arockers heart, which is unexpected (in fact, Disc 2 was a little unexpected) and she pulls it off, even if her voice seems to fit the flow of Disc 1 much better.  I give her major props for completely changing her style on this Disc, offering us a complete package so-to-speak.  `Pause the Tragic Ending' slows things down again, with a little Latin flare to the backing musical arrangement (yes, it's there).  The song is a tad forgettable, but while it's on you'll be intrigued.  `Don't' closes the album in a way I'm not too comfortable with.  It is nice, but a tad awkward, much like `Brown Eyes' was; just out of place.<br /><br />In the end this is an extraordinary album, even if a few tracks fall short of the majority of the album.  Every track is good, and all are worthy of your ears; and the standouts like `Duet', `The Only Fault'. `Little Life' and `Sidedish Friend' are some of the best songs you'll hear this decade.Disc 2 was a little unexpected) and she pulls it off, even if her voice seems to fit the flow of Disc 1 much better.

B001VPJYZK|5.0|Love the drama, the love and the bitching. Would and could not live without it.
B0012QCZ54|4.0|Okay, so these new wave dance flicks are a dime a dozen, and half of them are just mediocre offerings with one impossible dance move after the next.  When `Step Up' came out I really expected nothing from it, but I got a sensational and really, really great movie that had enough heart and chemistry to make it stand out amongst the onslaught of trashy teen dance movies.  Really, you need to see it!  So, I was excited about the prospects of `Step Up 2: The Streets', but after seeing the trailer I was afraid it was going to be nothing more than a rehash of the same story with different actors.<br /><br />So I waited.<br /><br />I am happy (so happy) to say that `Step Up 2: The Streets' does not have the same story, even though it is slightly similar.  It does lack the chemistry that made the original so charming, but the lead actress, Briana Evigan, carries enough saucy charm to make up for Robert Hoffman's lack of everything (the guy is kind of gross creepy here).<br /><br />Andie is a teen with no real purpose.  Her mother dies when she was young and she's been living with her mother's best friend.  She finds herself at a crossroads when her ties with the infamous 410 (a dance crew) leave her with two options; a prestigious dance school or Texas.  Now, I live in Texas, so I understand why she opted for the school.  She doesn't fit in (of course) but she finds herself flirting with even more danger when the school legend Chase Collins takes a liking to Andie, and her dance style, and convinces her to join forces with him, and a slew of talented yet overlooked students, in order to take on a street dancing competition.  Love develops, feelings are trampled, rivalries are started...and dancing HAPPENS!<br /><br />Like I said, Evigan is great.  She is sensual with a kick of edge that keeps her interesting; and that smoker's voice is just, UGH, so Scarlett Johansson...me loves it!  Robert Hoffman is the opposite.  He is supposed to be all charming and sweet and lovable but he comes across creepy.  The rest of the cast is really just a collection of moving bodies, and they all work well in that respect.  Miss Ventura is stunning to look at whether she's moving or standing still, I'll give her that.  Black Thomas (yes, that is his name) is respectable as the token gangster (very clich&eacute;, but whatever) and Danielle Polanco is quite engaging as the street-smart and genuinely sweet Missy.<br /><br />But this is not about acting, believe me.<br /><br />The dancing is insane here, and the final dance scene, in the rain, is just UGH, WOW...that was hot!  Yes, I said hot, and I meant that in like every possible way.  I did want to mention Adam G. Sevani (who looks like `Year One' version Michael Cera) who is your typical `nerdy kid who befriends outcast' here.  The reason I mention him is because his Michael Jackson inspired dace sequence at the end is phenomenal and easily the most memorable part of the entire movie.<br /><br />So, if you want a fun and entertaining film with lots of dancing then this is the one for you.  It doesn't have the `everything' factor that the original had, but it makes up for it in other areas.<br /><br />See them both.rest of the cast is really just a collection of moving bodies, and they all work well in that respect.

0385504225|2.0|I DEVOURED the DaVinci Code in a couple of days--could not put it down. This one...It's been over two weeks and I still haven't finished it! Just nothing really to take me forward...do I really think I will find out what the lost secrets of civilization will be in the end...of course not! So I already have limited interested in this  cross-Washington treasure hunt.    Aside from the pace, I have two major grievances with the book: 1) the villain is a Red Dragon ripoff. 2) The novel makes the female protagonist---Katharine---look like a blithering idiot. She is a world expert and researcher on Noetic science--and there are long scenes where Langdon is explaining to her some arcane tidbit or other. Now I know Brown needs a vehicle for disseminating his symbolist tidbits---but to have Katherine look wide eyed in every scene and say: \\"What is that?\\" is just too much.    If it weren't for the fascinating little pieces of history along the way, this one would have gone flying a long time ago!!!
045122499X|5.0|This book takes place in the 1300's.  Usually, books about that period can be boring.  This one is not.  It is fascinating and depicts the knights, earls, etc. as real people with ideas, schemes, desires, etc.  Great, long book!!!!
B0021L8UXU|5.0|Now first off I'm going to adress a certain subject. To J. Ryan: First off, 28 Days Later is NOT a zombie movie. It's a BIOHAZARD movie. The biohazard was called \\"The Rage\\", which caused people to turn into zombies. Come into contact with blood from the infected and you become one. Notice how nobody died when infected in either movie? Because THE VIRUS KILLS THEM. They are still living when turned into zombies, but when they're fully zombies they are dead and The Rage takes over them.<br /><br />Today I went to go see Zombieland, and I must say I really enjoyed it. With a talented cast like Woody Harrelson and Jesse Eisenberg, this film uses less and ends up with more- something I wish most comedies did nowadays. We've had brainless, unfunny flicks like those countless Date Epic Disaster Spartan Teen Movies from Failburg and Seltzerwater, I Love You Beth Cooper, and several more. But three movies- Observe and Report (Dark, Depressing, Violent, but Hilarious), THe Hangover (Good old drunken comedy), and now this.<br /><br />A virus has infected the United States of America, leaving but 6 people alive. Columbus Ohio, played brilliantly by Jesse Eisenberg, is but one of them, and considers the only reason he survived is because he followed his own rules. One day he meets Tallahassee, played by Woody Harrelson. He's a tough guy who has an addiction to twinkies and only one rule when it comes to Zombie fighting- \\"Nut up or shut up\\". ALong the way they meet Little Rock and Witchita, two sisters who are con girls. After an incident, they meet up again, only to have them gyp them again. As they make their way across the country, they do one thing and one thing only- fight zombies.<br /><br />This is an amazingly hilarious movie, I kid you not. It has a ton of WTF moments and LOL moments, and even a hilarious cameo from *SPOILER ALERT* Bill Murray *END SPOILER*. Yes the cameo lives up to the hype- it's the surprise cameo of the year! Eisenberg is already a better acter than Cera, no doubt about it. Abigail Breslin sure has grown up, as she is not only hilarious but an amazing actress too- she really shines.<br /><br />My only complaint is that I did not get some of the jokes- like the vaccum joke. I get it, it was a Ghostbusters riff, but I still didn't get it. Other than that this movie is damn hilarious, and definitely a must see this year.Abigail Breslin sure has grown up, as she is not only hilarious but an amazing actress too- she really shines.

Sure the hard cover has the original book cover design & the actual sheet cover has the poster inside.  That's pretty cool.  I was expecting more Q & A from Stephenie.  But of course, It's a Twilight thing & I love it & would buy it again.
B001PA0FFO|2.0|Yes harsh, and I love Hoffman and Streep, but this movie completely misses.  I will begin by saying doubt is usually a process implying a struggle of ideas over time.  Never mind me the corny powerful wintery storms that appear exactly when the movie presents key conflicts of traditionalism vs. progressivism and the struggle between Sister Aloysius Beauvier and Father Flynn.  Yes, I will overlook that if there were any real struggle of ideas or important presentations of movements through the balance of this film.  As the movie progressed I was expecting to see something far deeper than Sister Aloysius Beauvier's mission to remove Father Flynn from the parish due to his progressive practices, let alone possible pediphilia.  Instead we see her succeed in her selfish endeavor only to later fall into despair as she realizes her Catholic faith has been challenged if not lost altogether.  This is shallow because it ends just there.  Missed was an opportunity to depict a great struggle of doubt vs faith illustrated through the lifeless practice of the old perfect virtue vs. the progressive breakthrough of human acknowledgment.  I journeyed through the movie anticipating at some turn a corridor of profound depth through the simple discovery of compassion, tolerance, and charity.  In contrast the makers of this movie passed on as deep what is really extremely shallow.  The movie ended with no examen of consciousness, no self discovery, not even a personal challenge to their vocational choices.  Rather instead the movie just ends. Roll the credits.
0385504225|4.0|Everyone has their own ideas about what a quality book is.  For me, the book has to be readable first and foremost.  I've wasted lots of money on books that weren't really read able and I just could bring myself to finish.  Second it has to keep my attention and urge me to keep reading even when it's time to go to bed!<br /><br />The Lost Symbol is readable and it is very entertaining.<br /><br />That said, I do not think it is as good as some of his other books like The Da Vinci Code, Angels and Demons, or Deception Point.  I do think it was better than his first book, Digital Fortress though.<br /><br />While it's only my opinion,  I think people should stop being so critical of books and take them at face value.  That value is, did you enjoy reading the book?<br /><br />I can honestly say, I enjoyed the The Lost Symbol.  Although, the ending was much more drawn out that I felt it needed as it began to feel like it wouldn't end.  There were also a few parts that I felt weren't of the highest quality thinking, but then again that happens in a lot of books.  They were not that difficult to pass over as Dan Brown didn't keep bringing them up and for the most part weren't really relevant to the story as a whole.<br /><br />I will say there were a few twists that made for more interest, but that is something you see in all of Dan Browns books.  A reason I enjoy reading his works.<br /><br />So, to finish this review off.  This is a good book and definitely worth reading, but it isn't Dan Brown's best work.  I recommend you add it to your reading list, especially of you liked The Da Vinci Code and Angels and Demons.
B001EOQWFI|5.0|My BF and I really enjoyed this film, it's one of our favourites now. While watching for the first time we didn't notice that it was silent for half the movie, the characters were so expressive they didn't need to speak. Not an easy task when the actors aren't human! The animation was fantastic as well, before Wall-e boards the Axiom (and you see the humans) we found it easy to forget it was animated. It was as if we were watching a live action film. This is, in my opinion one of Pixars greatest films to date. I do have a very large HD TV, and I don't know if the quality would be as great without it, but the story is still fantastic!
1594202249|3.0|I liked this novel, even if it doesn't fully satisfy as either a work of literature or as a detective novel.  It may just be that I have a soft spot for `stoner hippies' (must be all those Cheech and Chong albums I listened to in the 70s) but I was content enough just to spend time with Doc, a likeable, perennially stoned, beach-bum hippie PI.<br /><br />Thomas Pynchon is one of contemporary literature's most compelling voices and fans of his sometimes dense and difficult fiction may not know what to make of Inherent Vice (first of all it's less than 400 pages, quite a bit shorter than the author's last novel, Against the Day, which is a remarkable 1,100 pages long).  Inherent Vice is a detective novel and in order to stay somewhat true to the genre, Pynchon is constrained a little as an author.  A detective novel is plot driven.  Clues must be followed and mysteries solved. But of course, Pynchon can't be contained completely.<br /><br />Inherent Vice isn't `just' a detective novel.  Pynchon has something to say about the end of an era.  The novel is set in 1970 with the Manson murders and the Vietnam War hovering overhead, like dark clouds that will inevitably drive away the short-lived idealism of the late 60s.  Pynchon rolls out a seemingly endless parade of colorful characters and fills Vice with storylines that sometimes merge and sometimes go nowhere.  We see LA through Doc's mostly innocent eyes (although we get a sense of his growing cynicism and paranoia).  His observations are sometimes inane, sometimes profound.  Pynchon has a reputation for merging high brow literature with low brow pop culture and he takes full advantage of time and place in Inherent Vice.  In particular, his knowledge of the music of the era is used to full advantage.<br /><br />But does it have enough of what Pynchon fans expect to satisfy them?<br /><br />It's hard to say but I think most will embrace this whimsical romp, decree it to be a lesser Pynchon novel, and note that even so, a lesser Pynchon novel is still worth reading.  Not everyone will agree though.  Some will inevitably declare it to be a `major bummer'.<br /><br />Fans of detective fiction are more likely to be bummed out by Doc's adventure.  While Doc occasionally demonstrates that not all his brain cells have been fried, he mostly bumbles along in a marijuana haze.  Doc's investigation lacks focus and urgency, and the convoluted plot comes together slowly with numerous distractions.  To be honest, by the end I didn't really care much how it all turned out.  If you read Inherent Vice expecting a typical detective novel, you probably won't find it very groovy.<br /><br />But if you can dig hanging out with Doc, an engaging, entertaining tour-guide, as he leads you on a convoluted romp through LA at the end of the psychedelic sixties, you may find this to be, while not a great novel, a pretty enjoyable ride none-the-less.<br /><br />3.5 stars.is still worth reading.

1594202249|1.0|This is my first experience with Pynchon and I have to say that this is one of the most useless novels I have ever read.  There is really nothing redeeming about it.  If you want to read good noir about LA then pick up  James Ellroy.  He is a true artist.  Anything in his LA Quartet is far superior to this.

B000UNYJXQ|5.0|God bless Michael Moore!<br /><br />This daring documentary exposes the sad facts of life behind all the systemic lies that the System heaps on everyone everyday! Cuba may be a Commie country, but when it comes to health care, it's funny to see how they truly have extraordinary common sense to take compassion on real people - unlike the American corporate elite! You can't help but pity the 9/11 firefighters and all the other unfortunate Americans who have all been let down by the very country they grew up in, by being passive victims of greedy corporations that try to dictate legislation on health care and insurance reform. Michael Moore's documentary shows a stark contrast between the greedy and dirty tactics of corporate America vs the sensible health care systems in Britain, France, Canada and Cuba.<br /><br />I live in a System where people are not treated like human beings but as units of government-supported profit machines. I personally know of cases where people are left to DIE just because the bureaucratic government policies and evil insurance companies! Even if you're \\"insured\\", it doesn't mean you're off the score board of those evil companies, so don't be so quick to dismiss this educational documentary.<br /><br />Singapore follows the same model as America and scores of citizens are under-insured or uninsured. But, Singapore is a queer story, best reserved for Part II of Sicko (Singapore edition).<br /><br />When will governments and the passive citizenry realize that people's lives are not the playthings of MNCs, insurance companies and governments to make more money than they already have? Unfortunately, in these sick and twisted days, the elite ruling classes of evil scumbags would rather maximize their profits at the expense of YOUR life. If you support such a system, then perhaps it is time to admit that you too are truly sick!<br /><br />If you support a system where CEOs and the ruling classes that oppose universal health care are able to \\"legally earn\\" millions of dollars out of sick and dying patients, and turn people away from health care just because the latter can't pay a bill, then you might as well have Jesus hasten the Apocalypse right away. These rich, evil CEOs and ruling classes that oppose universal care might as well not be born or if they're lucky - to have millstones tied round their necks and be drowned in the ocean! Maybe that could restore the balance of the planet's ecosystem!<br /><br />President Obama's current health care reform is a great step forward for America. It is puzzling to the rest of the world as why the President's plan towards health care reform is being so ridiculously opposed. Would you rather see the government spend money to save YOUR life and those of future generations in health care, rather than bailing out all those greedy companies in financial sector? Opponents of health care reform are willing to tolerate the government giving financial sector companies billions of dollars - only to see them make their already rich CEOs even richer with bonuses in the time of a global recession?<br /><br />In matters of health care and saving lives, there should be NO question about implementing a universal health care plan for all - not just for the ruling classes!

B000002JBG|4.0|This is one heck of a soundtrack! Hip hop and pop rock are the primary genres for Space Jam. You have R. Kelly, Seal, Monica, and D'Angelo singing extraordinary songs that anyone can enjoy listening to. My personal favorite song is \\"Hit 'Em High\\" by B Real, Busta Rhymes, Coolio, LL Cool J, and Method Man. It's pretty family-friendly, but it's still got an amazing beat and some creative lyrics. Monica's \\"For You I Will\\" is a classic, while R. Kelly's \\"I Believe I Can Fly\\" is an excellent cover. \\"Space Jam\\" by Quad City DJ's is also very catchy, and \\"Basketball Jones\\" by Barry White and Chris Rock is pretty funny. The last track called \\"Buggin'\\" is . . . weird. It's strange to hear Bugs rap; actually, it's strange to hear the Looney Tunes rap at all. But the rest of the soundtrack is solid. Even if you don't like hip hop, you'll probably like it here.
B001D63L7O|5.0|Everyone is vicious.  Maybe too realistic??  There are no decent characters for a bit of relief from the nastiness.  The tension & plot never let up.  Even Thelma Ritter is a professional snitch and what little humour she has is beyond black.  The acting and camera work are outstanding.  Even Jean Peters who I thought of as just a pretty face is quite incredible.  Widmark is expert at this kind of part, but Kiley even surpasses him in combining greed and cowardice.<br /><br />Kiley uses girlfriend Peters as a delivery girl but the microfilm gets picked by pickpoket Widmark.  The commies are upset not getting the scientific secrets so they lean hard on Kiley who leans hard on Peters.<br /><br />This film is so tense I can only watch it once in a great while.  Whereas most Noirs I can gobble like cookies.
B0000AYJXR|4.0|Who would have thought that Looney Tunes and Basketball would be a pretty good mix? Bugs and Daffy and friends are about to be taken as slaves for Mister Swackhammer, the proprietor for Moron Mountain. They must defeat Swackhammer's tiny minions with a game of basketball. This would be easier than expected (seeing that it was Bugs and his friends' idea in the first place), but the minions have stolen the talents of Basketball all-stars (including Patrick Ewing and Charles Barkley) and have become the \\"Monstars\\"! They are now stronger and bigger than they were before. So now, the Looney Tunes have only one hope: Michael Jordan. And what you get is 88 minutes of good ol' hilarity, with slapstick humor that's almost equal to the original animated Looney shorts.<br /><br />This is a very entertaining movie. It has Bugs, Sylvester, and Daffy playing basketball with M.J., which is a pretty memorable concept. The reason why I've given this film four stars instead of five is because of Lola Bunny. She was a very unnecessary addition to the Looney Tunes. She's not funny, she's irritating, and she tries too hard to look attractive. Another reason is Michael Jordan's acting. It's very wooden at times, but he's not as bad as Shaq (I think you know which movie I'm talking about). But everything else is just fine. Wayne Knight and Bill Murray are pretty funny in their supporting roles. But the real stars here are, of course, the Looney Tunes. I'm pretty sure that fans of Bugs, Yosemite Sam, Tweety, and Marvin the Martian will get a kick out of this movie. It's fun for both families and Looney Tunes fans.
B000002UAX|5.0|I have to write a review of the White Album in response to the official review on Amazon by Chris Nickson.  Of course, as Chris points out, it IS a legendary album.  And both Lennon and McCartney displayed once again that they were each genius songwriters.  However, Nickson's assertion that Lennon emerged as one of the towering rock figures of the time, while McCartney simply could STILL rock is absurd.  First off, the hardest (and best) rocking songs on the album are McCartney's: Back in the USSR, Helter Skelter (the hardest rock song the BY FAR the beatles ever recorded), and Birthday (which Lennon may have helped with a little).  Even Why Don't We Do it in the Road could be counted in this category.  As for the rest of McCartney's songs, while not as hard rocking, they are (overall) brilliant and represent for the most part the best and most diverse of the White Album.  While Lennon also had some great hard-rockers (yer blues, everybody's....monkey) he also wrote the softest and (arguably) least effective songs on the album.  As an example, compare McCartney's acoustic/softer white album songs (i.e. Blackbird, I Will, Mother Nature's Son, Martha My Dear, Rocky Raccoon, Honey Pie) with Lennon's: (Cry Baby Cry, Julia, I'm So Tired, Dear Prudence, Sexy Sadie, Continuing Story of Bungalow Bill, Goodnight).  While Sexy Sadie is probably a better song that Martha My Dear, most of the comparisons between songs (while great on both sides) tend to obviously tilt toward Mccartney:    1.  Rocky Raccoon is far better than Bungalow Bill    2.  Blackbird is far better than Julia (Julia was written using Blackbird's style    3.  Each Beatle wrote a song to parody older styles of music (honey pie has to be considered better than goodnight)    4.  And as good as Dear Prudence is, I have to go with a song like Mother Nature's Son (Its just got a better melody and is more of a classic)    Also, lets not forget that one of the few songs left off the White Album (but from the same sessions) was possibly the greatest Beatles song of them all:  Hey Jude.    Additionally, another great McCartney song from 1968 (although before the sessions for the White Album) was Lady Madonna.    Additionally, I noticed that some reviewers tended to laud \\"Revolution #9\\" as a great achievement of Lennon's and that it called for repeated listens.  Cmon - gimme a break, I havent listened to that song all the way through for years, and havent felt the urge to.  Most people agree that this quote on quote song is nothing worth hearing more than once.  Additionally, contrary to what most people think, McCartney was the avante garde Beatle who first experimented with the tape loops and various sounds that were used to make Revolution #9.  In fact, in early 1967, during the beginning of the Sgt. Pepper sessions, McCartney led the group through a recording using these tape loops and sounds effects which became the famous unreleased Beatles song known as \\"Carnival of Light\\".  Ultimately, the track was never released due to the fact that McCartney never envisioned that the song would be released.  Instead, the song was just the result of McCartney's desire to experiment with new sounds in the studio.  He felt that any notion of releasing such a sound collage as a song was absurd due to the fact that Beatles fans didn't want to hear such spontaneous experimentation, and instead wanted real songs.  Of course, the tape loops were used to great effect in \\"Tommorow Never Knows\\", and the groundbreaking use of tape loops in this song are one of the main reasons that the song is so highly regarded today.  Once again, while many attribute the tape loops to Lennon, their use was 100 percent the result of McCartney's avante garde inclinations during the mid '60s.      In closing, the main point of writing this review was to contradict many who say that Lennon was more important than McCartney during the sessions for the White Album.  However, I contend that even during 1968, when Lennon (who had experienced a songwriting drought in '66 and '67 - something Lennon later even admitted), experienced a resurgence in his songwriting capabilities, McCartney was the dominant songwriter in the group writing the bands greatest songs (Hey Jude, Blackbird, Helter Skelter, Back in the USSR, Why Don't We Do it in the Road?, Mother Nature's Son, Lady Madonna, I Will, Rocky Raccoon, Birthday).  After all, most of McCartney's songs from this era are far more famous today than Lennon's.      Of course, I love Lennon's Beatles songs and always maintain that John Lennon was a great musical genius (I would rank him the greatest ever behind McCartney).  However, it is quite apparent to me that from 1966 onward (The Beatles most experimental and influential era), McCartney was the dominant musical genius in the band (and, yes, overall an incredible lyricist as well.)
B002KDUDG6|4.0|When it comes to the music you hear on the radio, much of it is rash and harsh.  Some of it is mellow and wonderful.  Michael Buble's \\"Crazy Love\\" is a welcome addition to the softer, more mellow side of music.  Sure, this type of music is not for everyone.  Some people will call it and him boring, too mellow, too soft, but I find his voice soothing and his music a great addition to what I already own and listen to on a regular basis.    I really like the cover and the art on the CD case.  It is fun, colorful, and retro looking on the inside.  I know this doesn't make a difference in regards to how the music sounds, but it put me in a good, light-hearted mood from the moment I opened it and popped it into the CD drive on my laptop.    I always like it when artists \\"do their own music\\" because they can ruin what someone else already did well.  I'm happy to state that even though Michael did do a re-make of some other popular songs from the past, he did not ruin them.  They sound wonderful.  I was especially curious to see how \\"Georgia on my mind\\" would sound since I love Ray Charles' version.  It did not disappoint me.    I find the album as a whole pretty upbeat, fun, entertaining and something I could listen to again and again.  It is well put together and it's nice to see the title come to fruition after revealing what the songs are and what they have to say about \\"Crazy Love\\" because love and can be just that- CRAZY!
159448385X|5.0|I've read a lot of books. I've read a lot of history. I picked this book out of an Amazon list because 1: I got a book about Afghanistan for my son at the library- we knew absolutely nothing about Afghanistan, and 2: a fellow Amazonian put this tops on their list. So I read it. And I read it. I read it in all of two days. I cried, I raved, I cried some more, and I put it down, finished. But it is not finished.   It is the best, horribly glorious book I have ever read in my life. At times, when my kids gave me some space, I conferred with the library childrens book of Afghanistan, to look up the faces of Massoud, Daoud. To see the twin Buddhas carved from the mountain, to see Kabul. And in my bathroom, in hiding, I cried and cried. A subtle look at Islam, an in depth study of women living in Islam, of history- war, upheaval, war, but most importantly, of hope. It is absolutely, tragically, brilliantly, beautiful. Khaled Hosseini deserves the Nobel Peace Prize.
B002BIULQ2|3.0|First let me say that the enjoyment that my 6 year old daughter got out of The Hannah Montana Movie was 5 stars. Since getting The Movie on DVD last week she's probably watched it a dozen times. It's a feel-good movie that preaches the importance of family and friends over material stuff in a material word.<br /><br />If you've seen the Disney Channel series [[ASIN:B001EOQWNK Hannah Montana]], you kinda know what you're getting with this movie. Basically a lot of silliness about a pop star who no one seems to recognize if she takes off her blonde wig. Blonde she's Hannah; a little darker without the wig and she's Miley. The wig even fools people really close to her! Amazing.<br /><br />While full of inconsistencies, recycled gags, clich&eacute; themes and common movie morale lessons, The Hannah Montana Movie is a pleasing, warm story that young children will enjoy...especially for those already fans of the TV series. The acting is fair at best and even a little tough to watch at times, but no one involved ever really set out to make an Oscar Award winning blockbuster here, right?<br /><br />It was just really nice to cuddle up with my daughter (again and again...and again), appreciate the joy the movie was bringing her and listen to her sing along to the songs. Heck, I caught myself singing along with [[ASIN:B0022V1ZCM Back to Tennesse]], Miley's Dad's song in the movie.<br /><br />So if you have a little girl that's a fan of Miley Cyrus or the Disney series she stars in, The Hannah Montana movie will be enjoyed thoroughly. As for me, well...while not the best movie I've seen this year, I'm happy to sit through it with my little girl as many times going forward as she asks me to...and I hope it's a lot of times!
B00127RAJY|5.0|My husband and I have been doing this video for a little over two weeks now and wow! It is very hard to get through it (even level 1!) at first, but if you stick with it you will improve. Very Very worth the money.
0316017922|1.0|I have to disclaim this review - I could not finish the book.  It made me so sick I had to stop about half-way.<br /><br />Gladwell takes real-life examples like Bill Gates and professional sports players, and tries to explain to us that their success is due to many factors other than their intelligence, physical ability, or hard work.  He does occasional, almost parenthetical, lipservice to hard work, but tries to dismiss it as far from the most important factor in success.<br /><br />Bill Gates was the son of a wealthy couple, and went to a school that enabled him to have access to one of the few early computers.  Sports legends were born at the early part of their cutoff year, making them bigger and stronger than their peers at an early age.  He even tries to explain that the Beatles are good because they had the ability to play in Germany 7 days a week!<br /><br />While these facts seem to have some merit, it is these that should be parenthetical.  Sure, I'm not a professional hockey player because there was no rink in my part of the country.  I'm not a professional athlete because I wasn't born in January, ahead of my peers.  And I'm not a professional musician because I did not have access to play in clubs 7 days a week.<br /><br />But Gladwell misses the point.  Success is largely due to one part God-given talent/smarts, many parts hard work, and of course a whole lot of luck.  What he misses though is that those that are not successful had their own advantages but didn't capitalize on them.<br /><br />I'm not saying the world is a level playing field.  But Gladwell tries to argue that success has little to do with the individual.  It's sad that the country continues to move in this direction.  Failure is anyone's fault but our own, and the other guy's success is due to the fact that he comes from a wealthy family or was lucky.<br /><br />The book is also littered with un-substantiated libearl-ism's like \\"the rich get all the tax breaks.\\"  Come on.  This review is not a debate for tax policy but anyone making more than $100K knows that tax breaks expire as income goes up, and tax rates increase.<br /><br />This is a sad book.  When you read it, fight the urge to scratch your head and think maybe he's right.  He's not.  Do not listen to him.  And if you yourself want to succeed, I beg you do not buy this book.

B00009MGGI|5.0|Well written and acted British political thriller.  Ian Richardson plays the villain with cool aplomb and the ending is a lovely twist.
B000002JSJ|4.0|Best song:      Nobody's fault but mine - I gave this song a tick in my notes, which means I quite like it...it's unusual for me to like their songs enough to give them a tick...their fourth album got more than one tick, which is why I rank it as one of the all time great albums. IF this song isn't on a compilation, it really should be! The lead guitar wails like a banshee in this track, and lead singer Robert Plant nicely harmonises with it.  It then turns into a bluesy, boogie rock song. I like the low-down sound of the guitar here. Song also features the harmonica.      Next best song:      Tea for one - running at 9:26 minutes in length,  this song has a Moody Blues vibe to it. Languid, with long, bluesy notes on the lead guitar. The guitar has a ringing sound on this track.          Not a bad song:      For your life - a bluesy, boogie rock track, which is bassy. Did find this rootsy kind of song more engaging than their earlier forays into those kind of genres.          The rest:      Achilles last stand - another monster length track...10:24. Has a driving rhythm to it, which is vaguely \\"Barracuda\\" ish...i.e. the classic hard rock song by Heart. Bonham's drumming is fast and as tough as nails in the middle of this track. Lead guitar is bluesy at times.    Royal Orleans -  a quirky track which has some bongos.     Candy store rock - a bluesy, 1950's style rock'n'roll song.  Robert Plant seems to be channeling Elvis Presley when he sings. Bassy, with a grumbling guitar sound to it. I think that one of the lines in this song is \\"Inside your jaw\\", which sounds quite suss!    Hots on for nowhere - a bluesy, bassy track with a solo. Lyrics feature the words \\"la la la la\\".         Recommendations:      Led Zeppelin IV - their greatest album and an all time great album.    Led Zeppelin III - a rootsy album which works well for me where other albums of theirs don't.    Led Zeppelin: Houses of the holy - not a bad album.    The Heartbreakers: L.A.M.F.   Early punk stylings from this American punk/rock band. Lots of 1950s influences and boogie rock.    The New York Dolls: The New York Dolls.  Rock'n'roll, boogie rock, featuring Johnny Thunders, who would later go on to form The Heartbreakers.    The Stooges: The Stooges.   Influential rock band which influenced the pioneers of punk.    Radio Birdman: Radios Appear.  Australian punk pioneers, with The Saints. The Stooges were one of their influences.    Blue Cheer: Vincebus Eruptum. The first heavy metal album, influenced by The Jimi Hendrix Experience.    The Damned: Damned, damned, damned. The first English punk album. Also had 50s influence on them.

My laptop runs Windows XP home with a free Chart software called OpenCPN and the free charts downloaded from nauticalcharts.noaa.gov, yes you can your charts for free from NOAA!

B002KDUDG6|2.0|I am a long time fan who is disappointed with this release.    Both the singer and his band are strong yet in this album the band often overwhelms the singer.  Starting with the band's strong presence in the first track, regretfully the track and following songs do not allow the listener to be enveloped by the Michael for whom the album was bought for in the first place.  If I wanted a strong band I would have pursued another Herb Albert release.    Secondly, Michael tries to over personalize his renditions of classic tracks. These works stand on their own and I am grateful they are used. However, Micheal's vocal strength is diminished in his pursuit of custom rearrangement. One track has Micheal and background vocals purposely 1/2 step off.  While periodic usage is fine, multiple leaves the listener wincing for the anticipated repeated. All is not for naught, there are 4 tracks worthwhile including 'Haven't Met You Yet'.    I expect Michael negotiated a large unrecoupable advance for 3 more albums and after slippage, this was a rushed release.  Hopefully, the following album in 18 months will be returning to Micheal's earlier successful formula. (yes, you are right... x-BMG exec.)

My mother was fortunate to receive an advanced copy of \\"Have a Little Faith\\". She brought it to my house and left it on my kitchen counter. I picked it up and from the moment I read the back cover page, I was incredibly intrigued and moved by this story. I wanted to read the book in one day, but I didn't. I savored it over a two week period, reading a little bit each day. The wisdom, philosophy and insight into life and people in general is priceless. I consider myself spiritual, not necessarily religious. You don't have to be to enjoy this book. Although it has a religions context, it's message is clearly about being good, doing good and seeing good in other people....and having faith, of course. I have shared my copy with several members of my family and have told others of this book. Thank you Mitch Albom for writing \\"Have a Little Faith\\" and thank you Hyperion Books for publishing it.

0385504225|4.0|Please read the Amazon description for the plot. This is about the writing. No spoilers.<br /><br />Having finished the book about a week ago, I've given a lot of thought as to why I didn't like this book as much as his previous entries. I have a theory that once an author is so popular that, on the cover, his name is actually larger than the title of the book, the publisher has turned editing into a formality. This book suffered from what I call Too-Big-For-His-Pants-itis. I've seen it happen to Stephen King, Kathy Reichs, John Grisham, Dean Koontz, etc..., and it hasn't stopped.<br /><br />The amount of active editing, as compared to passive copy-editing, for these bigger-than-life authors takes a nosedive because the publisher knows that most of us will pretty much buy a grocery list with the right name attached.<br /><br />Brown's other books were well-edited and moved along at breakneck speed. In each subsequent book, you could see him growing as a writer. Whoever edited his earlier work wanted him to be successful, and in turn, make money for the publishing house. This book was riddled with contrived dialogue and well-worn exclamations (!!!) that you just didn't find (a lot of) in his other novels.<br /><br />And this is the problem with the publishing industry today.  Look at the latest book covers of the big-name authors and the font size of their names is so large, you have to squint to read the title.<br /><br />When you start seeing that with your favorite author, it's over. Their editors are simply running a spell-checker, probably making a few run-on sentences not 'run on' so long, and then it's off to the printing press. It wasn't always like this, and sadly, it's become the norm. How many times have you heard someone say or comment that his or her early novels were so much better. This is why.<br /><br />I've read a few Koontz novels from his early days, and while the actual concept might have been a stinker, the writing was superb. Fast-paced, trimmed to perfection, with his excellent ability of getting us to suspend disbelief. Koontz barely even tries today, and what editor is going to tell their money machines that what they wrote is crap and will require months of rewrites. Publishers don't even bother. Which all goes back to my book cover, grocery list theory.<br /><br />I hope this trend ends soon, because the last few novels I read by Grisham, Koonts, and King (to name only a few) were so horrible I felt dirty for having put in the time to finishing them. Maybe the publishing industry is in the toilet because people are sick of buying the hardcover book (or using Kindle), finding it's nothing like the author's earlier work, and are rightly P.O.'d. They'd rather borrow the book from a friend who did pay top dollar for it or go to the library and check it out. In this economy, who wants to invest in a piece of garbage?<br /><br />Remember the last time a movie was made based on a Koontz or Grisham or King novel? Me neither. Would you want to see a movie based on their latest work?<br /><br />The one thing Brown does have going for him compared to the big boys is that in the publishing world, he's still a 'newish' author. I doubt he reads these comments, but if he does, here's my advice to him: continue educating us like you did in the Lost Symbol, and find another editor who isn't afraid to say, \\"Dan, we have a lot of work to do if we want to make this a thrilling bestseller.\\" Same for King and all the others.of getting us to suspend disbelief.

0792164903|4.0|Sleepy Hollow is a rare blend of gothic atmosphere, slice-and-dice gore, and black humor, a horror fantasy that works both as horror and as fantasy.  Tim Burton fleshes out the legend of the Headless Horseman and creates a starkly striking and frightening world.    With the deft touch that Burton has at his best he builds a world of unparalleled imagination that is completely believable.  And in Sleepy Hollow, that world is the stage for a story that's thrilling and with just the right amount of twisty-turny mystery.  Costume horror doesn't often surpass its stuffy surroundings to be either genuinely fun or spooky, but Sleepy Hollow does both.

0691142165|5.0|As Martin Wolf from Financial Times has written... \\"A MASTERPIECE\\"    One of the most interesting things about this books is that it combines a very rigorous research on the topic while keeping it accessible to a large audience. The book is self-contained, with definitions provided along the way, which makes it easy for people with no previous knowledge in economics to enjoy and understand it.     The authors also put together a database without precedents in the area which not only makes their statements much stronger, but also makes a great contribution to the field.

0385504225|1.0|Sadly, I bought The Lost Symbol when it first came out and the Amazon rating was 5 stars.  I should have waited for a few other brave readers to weigh in so the rating would be closer to reality.    Read the 1 and 2-star reviews and they all pretty well sum it up.  The book is long, slow and reads more like a history book with a paragraph of plot advancement every couple of pages.    I assume the history, and details around the Masons, is correct.  That was interesting for a while, but it got to be too much.    The description of Pod 5 was absurd.  A giant warehouse with a lab in the back corner.  The warehouse is too big to heat, so it's cold when you enter.  That's fine, but also dark???  The lab workers have to cross the expanse (a 90 second walk) in complete darkness?  Seriously?  Boeing manages to put lights in their massive warehouses.  Why couldn't this company?  I won't spoil it, but it turns out there is a lame reason why it's pitch black.      At one point Langdon needs to call Kathrine, but doesn't have her phone number.  He calls a 3rd party to get her number and calls her cell.  When the incoming call comes through she glances at her cell phone and the caller ID tells her it's Robert Langdon.  That would be pretty cool if cell phone actually had caller ID, but as of yet, they don't.    All in all, it's probably not a horrible book.  I was hoping for something comparable to DVC, so I was sorely disappointed.

B000002H7I|5.0|I have most of the rest of Tracy Chapman, but I hadn't actually stopped to listen to anything from this CD.  Then I heard \\"Crossroads\\" on the radio and just had to go ahead and pick up the CD.      \\"Crossroads\\" is some of Ms. Chapman's strongest work. The ten songs are thoughtful, emotive and deliver a message of life lived hard with the hope of redemption that you will remember. My three favorites are \\"Crossroads\\", \\"This Time\\" and \\"All that you have is your Soul\\".  Truthfully, there really isn't a bad song on the album.      The title work \\"Crossroads\\" is probably the most memorable of the bunch. As you might imagine, this music deals with choices.      \\"This Time\\" swears she will live her life differently this time around. She's made some mistakes, but this time will be different.      \\"All you have is your soul\\" closes the CD and carries on the theme of life and redemption that Chapman's established throughout the music.  A lovely coda to some powerful tunes.      Rebecca Kyle, October 2009
B0027REDN4|4.0|Its not ground breaking but it sounds great.  Everything old is new again.  Nobody does this type of music this well anymore.  It just sounds awesome its really refreshing to hear.  In the old days I hated artillery because there albums sounded like crap.  But with recording technology being what it is now you really have to try hard to sound bad. So Artillery finally gets there due.  Great music great sound a must have for any fan of old school thrash.  If you are to young to remember old school thrash buy and learn what real music is supposed to be like.
B0025KVLT2|3.0|I bought this cd for two reasons. One, I never had the album and wanted it. Two, the advertising about the remastering the way it was supposed to be before the so called executives softened it up because of the following quote:    The album was softened up in its original 12-song American edition to jibe with the Dylan/Byrds folk-rock sound, as well as squeeze money from the Parlophone catalog.    Well, it sounds the same as the songs on the best of cd's that Apple has put out. I was disappointed. So if you already have the earlier so called \\"remasters\\" you won't need to buy this one.     One other comment, personnaly I'm sick of all this remastering non-sense. I expect to hear a substantial difference when something is remastered. Anything, more bass, bigger drums, screaching guitars, whatever, just something that tells me somebody took the original studio recordings and basically made a new record of it.
B002GZQY6Q|3.0|After Fear of a Blank Planet and Nil Recurring, I was anxiously expecting another masterpiece by this excellent band.  Unfortunately, in my own personal view, The Incident is not up to par with its preceding albums as it lacks the innovation factor that I learned to love from Porcupine Tree.   Guitar riffs that we have heard before, same old drum patterns, and I would even say some cheesy sounding moments (I'm drawing the line, I'm drawing the line - ugh!) that do not live up to the band's previous creations.  It would seem as if releasing this album was somehow rushed and not enough effort was put into it.  In spite of this, I would say that this is still a great album in general terms.  Now, is it a great Porcupine Tree album...?   I would not say so.

1433502429|5.0|For me, this is the gold standard of Bibles. The scholarship that has gone into the ESV and the ESV Study Bible specifically is unprecedented in my opinion. If you are a King James reader from years past, the transition to ESV versions will be easier than to the NIV. The ESV is very scholarly, and reads at a much higher level than the NIV's, but that shouldn't scare anyone away. It uses the more precise theological terms when they are the best choice - words like sanctified and justified and propitiation - words that are rich in meaning that is often lost or diluted in other translations. I do own 6 ESV Bibles, and they are what I use 75% of the time in my day-to-day life and studies.  I own 2 of the ESV Study Bibles, one of the TruTone, and one in the black calfskin.I also have downloaded the ESV Study Bible into my BlackBerry cell phone.<br /><br />As a pastor, I do my studies using the ESV to get the richer content and depth of meaning from the text, and then having notes at the bottom of the page from some of the best renown Evangelical scholars alive today helps give additional clarity and inspiration after I have worked through the text.<br /><br />The calfskin they are using to cover these Bibles is supple beyond my imagination.  Without question this is the nicest Bible I have ever held in my hands.  The calfskin calls out to be held and touched.  I've never experienced a cover of this quality.

You have to way at looking at this.    1- You expect the same kind of trip and you liked the last trip so you think this one wille be along the same lines.    2- The friend in question is a great trip planner and you let him loose because you know that whatever he chose to make you do. it will be amazing.    If youre in the first categorie you might be disapointed. if in the second, you wont.    I started to listen to muse in the \\"absolution\\" era. i did not love it at first. it grew on me. eventually i realised i was listening to one of the best bands of its era and probably belonged with the legends of rock of all era combined.    I then listened to their earlier stuff loving it but not as much as Absolution.    When \\"black holes and revelation\\" came out i though it was great but it was no Absolution. A couple on months into BHAR i realised it was far superior to absolution. easely their best album in my opinion.     Now for the resistance. Well of course When i first heard it i thought it was great but it was not close to black holes and revelations.    Well After a couples of weeks of listening i can tell you i think its superior to black holes and revelation. its rich is full of ideas. there are more great songs on this album. Black hole had a couple this one you count the ones that arent great. and there is just one \\"guiding lights\\". Not bad but the weakest.    as for the comparison with other band (ie: Queen in this album). its true that \\"united states of eurasia make you feel in \\"we are the champions\\" but its does not last long. Besides if you think of the band today , so often they are so similar that you cant even compare them how many band sound the same and make generic rock band albums. i am glad that MUSE has the guts to channel Queen. its different they channeled one band on one song. It does not make them the same it makes them different.    If you want a great rock album that is different and is a trip for your mind. get this   and listen to it a few time until you click and you will be wondering why you did not heard them, or of them, earlier.
B001GCUO1Q|4.0|\\"X-Men Origins: Wolverine\\" was a great movie.  I am not one to usually review movies, as I'm more of a book buff, but it was so good that I had to comment.<br /><br />Taking my love of the X-Men comic books series aside, the movie was fantastic.  There was a ton of action, many open endings (which can be taken both ways, see below), and so much action was covered.  I loved the CGI, though at times it was obvious.  His claws were a bit too cartoon-y, and even in the scene of his first lumberjack job, the bulk machines were obviously not really there.  Also, in the scene with Gambit in the alley, obviously CGI- but I don't really expect the guy to climb the walls in real life.<br /><br />Loved the scenes with Hugh Jackman during Stryker's experiment, but thought the director was trying a little too hard to make Wolverine a love-struck sissy boy.  I mean, Logan is like Bruce Wayne in Batman.  He's hardcore, strong, and revenge-driven.  Maybe Batman vs. Wolverine isn't the best description, but... hey, I hope you get my point.  Maybe I don't remember the comics as well as I believe I do, but I thought the whole Wolverine vs. Sabertooth was due to the dad killings, not the girl.<br /><br />I don't remember many of the characters they brought up, like Wolverine's girl- I don't remember her in the comics, but maybe she came up in a later edition that I just haven't read yet?  I was thankful that they showed that Wolverine volunteered for Stryker's experiment, as it is true to the comics.<br /><br />I wish they made the movie longer because it's hard to keep everything straight with years in between while we're waiting on the movie productions.  The Blob I would have loved more story on.  As well as Gambit.  Even Omega Red (? Didn't name him ?) (Weapon XI) would have benefited from a little more of a story. I was disappointed to see it ended just as the next movies began, but I guess that's expected.  I wanted more of Cyclops as well.<br /><br />Liev Schreiber did a great job of protraying Sabertooth.  Though he was not the same actor who cameo-ed Sabertooth in X-Men I (or was it X II?), I will accept him as the future Sabertooth.<br /><br />The movie seemed short, they overused Wolverine's CGI claws a little too much at the beginning, but... overall I was impressed with the story, the acting, and the true-to-the-books plot.<br /><br />I can't wait for the next origins (I've heard it's Storm next?) and I want more more more of Wolverine's story.  He is my favorite character in the comics.  I think this is one of the movies that Jackman can get right when it comes to his acting skills.  His portrayal of Wolverine (throughout all of the XMen movies) has been stellar, even if it is a bit sappy.e was not the same actor who cameo-ed Sabertooth in X-Men I (or was it X II?), I will accept him as the future Sabertooth.

0061719544|1.0|This is a typical fall and redemption story which could have been much more interesting had Ferguson dispensed with some of his commentaries about women and wives and focused on what he actually did to succeed.  According to this version, Ferguson apparently has never had a calculating or planned thought in his head, but rather has been swept along on a tide of innate humor, imperviousness to failure, addiction, luck, a homey family and multiple spouses.  Somehow not particularly credible, much as it is nice to have him as a U.S. citizen.
0385504225|3.0|Although it took me a good 300 pages to say the book was great,  I did end up enjoying this novel.  I do have to say that it was impossible to live up to the expectations of The Da Vinci Code which I totally loved.  As I read the book I also could not get away from envisioning Tom Hanks as Robert Langdon and few cast members from \\"24\\" or CTU on his trail.      The plot was somewhat predictable for the first part of the book and did read somewhat like a screenplay,  however I did think there were some unexpected surprises during the last 200 pages of the book.  There was much detail that would be fine to leave out and make the book shorter but for those of us who enjoy reading and want a great vacation book,  I thought this was a good read.

0375826726|4.0|I have enjoyed this series and this new author.  Like so many fantasy creations, it builds from book to book.  I liked the short review in the beginning of the book that helped tie it to Eragon and Eldest.  There was a gap of time that allowed me to forget some details.  I would recommend it to others.    That said, here is what I didn't like.  There was no soft cover edition so I was forced to buy a hardcover (money issue).  I was ready for the conclusion and now I have to wait again for another hardcover.  Things seemed to drag a bit in Brisingr, like it was slow to develope.  Maybe it was because Christopher had too much for one book and not enough for two.  Who knows?    I will definately read book four.  I want closure.  Christopher has a bright future in fantasy.  Considering his age, he is an amazing story teller, a good read.

0385504225|4.0|My husband and I both enjoyed this book very much.  I won't repeat some of the other criticisms about it being too long etc.  I agree with that, but we enjoyed a recent trip to Washington D. C. more just because we made a point to visit places in his book that Dan Brown talked about at length. We enjoyed both of his other books and movies too.  I hope he continues to write, but maybe makes a change and writes something a little bit different.    Just a warning note to Kindle 2 readers.  This particular book does not have \\"text to speech\\" enabled.  Neither of us realized that could happen at all, and didn't notice Amazons disclosure, located just below the price.  Its not Amazons fault that we didn't notice, so I am not assigning blame to anyone, other than myself.  My husband read the book first on his original Kindle and enjoyed it so much that he suggested I download it on my Kindle 2 so we could listen to it in the car on our trip to Washington D. C.  We were very disappointed and ended up with me reading the whole book outloud to us both.  Boy was that a tiring experience.  Just wanted to warn any other stupid Kindle 2 owners, like me.  If you think you might want to listen to a book, be sure and check before downloading it to make sure that the \\"text to speech\\" is enabled on the book you want.

B001OQCV2Y|4.0|A team of American guerillas terrorizing Nazis behind enemy lines, a Jewish woman (Melanie Laurent) running a movie theater in occupied France, and a feared SS officer (Christoph Waltz) cross paths with explosive consequences.      Writer/director Quentin Tarantino's WWII adventure is gripping, but overrated.  The running time of nearly three hours flew by, and I was riveted by the stories of the woman and the Nazi; however, the Basterds themselves did not hold my interest for a moment.  Brad Pitt, as their leader, really stands out for his awful performance when contrasted with the many wonderful but lesser known actors in this film, such as Diane Kruger playing a German movie star who is also a double agent.  Tarantino's gimmicks are not as numerous as they are in some of his other projects, but they are jarring when they occur.  Many see them as exuberant nods to B-movie history, but they strike me as indulgences that rarely serve the story.  Nevertheless, the rest of the film is so good that I have no trouble recommending it.      And the way he ends WWII is a lot more satisfying than the way it really ended.
B002BPQ0Y2|5.0|...and will be hailed as a seminal moment in pop music. The E.N.D is a collection of incredible pop hooks, amazing arrangements, and virtuosic talent. In this album, the Black Eyed Peas have staked a huge claim in pop music and said, \\"this is the new hit sound.\\" And with 26 consecutive weeks at #1, they have proven it.   The E.N.D is a classic that you must have and will eventually buy. Your kids will buy it. It is the Thriller of the 'now generation.'     Rolling Stone didn't have the balls to write it, but the E.N.D. is truly a masterpiece. Pop music doesn't get better than this, only matched by what is to come from Lady Gaga. It is a very important album.
B001C4CI8U|3.0|I have loved J.J. Abrams et al for creative shows like Alias and Lost. I'm not familiar with Trek allusions, but loved X-Files.<br />I have been watching Fringe for the past few nights, and in places it reminds me of Alien!<br /><br />The in-your-face gore was off putting.  Became predictable after a few scenes.<br />Back to Alien...(no spoilers here)...if you liked the various frightening, startling  things that happen to folks in  an alternate reality, you'll love the 1st season of Fringe.<br /><br />Biggest disappointment: felt that J J and writers have borrowed bits and pieces from Lost and Alias.  Warmed over Lost/Alias was not what I expected.<br /><br />Love Dr. Bishop's character...very good...no stereotype here.<br /><br />Also loved (and needed) the informative Fringe explanations.<br /><br />Not sure I will buy 2nd season, tho', with no TV, I may, if only to support J J's creativity.  We need original, fresh material and J J is absolutely capable of giving us this.<br /><br />Fingers crossed :).
B001FB4VZS|4.0|Unfortunalety the second disk of the box is damaged. I tried to play it in three diferent equipment, but doesn't run in chapters 2 and 3 of that disk.
B00011CZRE|4.0|Right to the point, a wholly original film on all levels, and one of Pitt's best.  The only thing out place for me is the finale.  As the storyline goes, each person guilty of his/her deadly sin was killed for commiting said sin.  Exception being Brad Pitt's character guilty of Wrath and yet not killed for his sin.  Obviously, I still love this movie and this exception did not ruin it for me.  If anyone out there has any feedback or even a different interpretation, I'd be glad to hear it.
B001H5X7I4|5.0|The whole cast was really good.  I have watched this DVD probably five times already, and liked it each time.  There are not many movies that have replay value like that for me.  It is definitely a guy movie, and those seem to be lacking in number these days.
B002MW50KO|5.0|I'll keep it short and simple.  I'm a Bob Dylan fan...and yes, I'm aware that his voice is scraggly and cranky and jagged and raspy.  There's no other way to describe it. Yes, if it was someone else, we'd dismiss it with haste as bad and hard to listen.  But it's Bob Dylan, who has lent his voice to our culture and we still hear his voice in the soundtrack of our society. There's more to melody than pitch, folks.    Two main reasons I love this recording of Christmas standards: 1) It's Bob Dylan and 2) He is giving all profits and royalties in perpetuity to feeding the hungry.  For ten bucks, you get a unique Christmas CD and you can do a little to help the less fortunate.     If you don't care for the CD, fine...just throw the ten bucks into the Salvation Army bucket.
B002C1BHIO|5.0|With everything moving from component to HDMI, it seems as if everyone is trying to sell HDMI cables these days.  The cost ranges from the \\"over expensive\\" to the \\"super cheap\\".  But what brand can you trust?  What will get you the best quality signal at a decent cost?  AmazonBasics is the answer.  From the simple packaging, to the very sturdy and robust cable - you can't go wrong.  This cable provided the perfect quality I desired to hook up my ps3 to my Onkyo receiver.  The picture was crystal clear, and the audio was fantastic.  Also, with the durability of this cable, it will last for years to come.
0061914177|5.0|Crush It! is a short, smart, and incredibly useful book for anyone who wants to build a thriving online presence.<br /><br />You know the saying, \\"Those who can, do.  Those who can't, teach?\\"  This book is an exception to the cliche, since Vaynerchuk has used the Internet to capture the interest and attention of millions of people.  In Crush It! he teaches us exactly how he did it.<br /><br />Vaynerchuk's success can be distilled to two main points: work your butt off, and care like crazy about your audience.  He fleshes out this book with all sorts of practical real-world examples about the steps he's taken to build his online empire.<br /><br />There's no shortage of books in this genre --- the topics covered in Crush It! are being tackled by all sorts of authors right now.  But doesn't it make sense to learn your lessons from somebody who is a doer first, and a writer second?  I'm a big fan of Vaynerchuk's personal website, where he commonly posts videos about succeeding in the online world.  I constantly feel like his insights are six months ahead of what everybody else is thinking.<br /><br />If online audience building is a game you want to play, you can't afford to pass up reading this book.
B002BSHWUU|5.0|I've been waiting for a proper remaster of all the Beatles' CD albums for awhile now and with this boxed set, we finally get it. Audio quality is top notch and each album comes with a short documentary on the making of the album.    The first few albums are presented in stereo on CD for the first time and generally it's a better alternative to the mono editions, although the stereo soundstaging is a bit strange with voices coming out of one channel.    Nevertheless, this boxed set is everything I've expected from a premium boxed set and the inclusion of so many rare photos and videos for each disc is something that a Beatles fan like me will really appreciate.
B002LBGBR2|5.0|Not being a Beyonce fan previously, this edition of I am...Sasha Fierce has done much to convert me. The tracklisting is different to the first edition, which also an improvement in my opinion. The bonus DVD with music videos and interviews demonstrate Beyonce's artistry and inspiration for this album.
0061914177|4.0|If you've ever watched Gary speak, then you are aware of the intensity, energy, and passion that this man has. Gary is a machine, and as evidenced by his rise to the top of our blogging world and soon the mainstream media world, it is obvious that he has what it takes to not only create a successful business, but to inspire others to do the same.    Crush It is no different than hearing Gary speak, as the energy moves straight from the voice recorder to the page. Although the book is shorter than most, I appreciate that there isn't any fluff and that there is something worth reading in every single chapter. Although I'm familiar with most of the topics in the book, I couldn't help but to stop reading and take notes every 5-10 minutes...there's that much to take in.     Crush It will inspire you to do amazing things in your own life as long as you are strong enough to take the steps necessary to pull them off. There is also loads of step by step and \\"how-to\\" info in this book, which is something that many in the category lack. If there's one shortfall of this book, it's that Gary's energy can be difficult to keep up with, and you might feel like you can't follow in his steps without having the same inner fireball. Although I believe anyone can follow the steps in this book, only you can make it happen.    I finished the book at 10pm on a Tuesday, and I was up until 4AM writing down ideas. You can't go wrong with Crush It.
B002KDUDG6|5.0|This is certainly Michael's best work.  His voice is coming directly from his soul.  Cry Me a River shows what a powerhouse he is.  Stardust with Naturally 7 is one of the most incredible songs I have ever heard.  He sounds like an angel.  Haven't Met You Yet is such a fun song with a great video starring his new lady love.  His broken heart is clearly heard in Hold On.  Michael and his band are what all entertainers should aspire to.  Michael like a fine wine is getting better with age.  This is a \\"must have\\" for any Buble fan and everyone with ears should own a copy.  Michael thanks for the music and I look forward to the tour.
