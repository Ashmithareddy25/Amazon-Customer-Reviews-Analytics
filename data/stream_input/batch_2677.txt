B00CWY76CC|5.0|Took me and my younger sister forever  to figure it all out. It was so much fun and very very educational. I hope to see more games like this.
B00D3ZJB1S|5.0|My review is for the Best Buy 12 song version.The 1st disc is probably some of the best Heavy Metal music ever layed down to track.I'm just blown away at the talent these musicians put together on the 1st 8 songs.Some of their very best.Not a bad song and worth every penny paid...Now for the extra 4 songs.Not at all like the 1st disc.More like speedy heavy metal you would have listened to in the 80s-90s.I wont listen to the bonus disc again,because its not that great.But if you're a completest,buy them........AND support your favorite artists.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I think that this game is really fun. One thing that i would of liked to see is possibilities to earn gru coins. But overall it is superb..
B001AQR3JY|5.0|One of the best disney movies around.  My niece wanted it for her birthday and I was able to get it from Amazon before they put it back in the vault.
B00DMM3WVM|5.0|What a great game, I just downloaded it and it is awesome, sweet graphics and so fun an addicting. Recommended to all killing zombie fans and runners alike.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|This is one of the best animated movies I've seen in a long time.  It's great movie to watch with the whole family.  The minions are very cute and very funny.  The ending is fantastic (don't worry, no spoilers here).
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game it is really cool i recommend you guys to download ! :)<br />Even for kids i really enjoy this game
B009NQZVKG|5.0|I love the Sigma force series of books.  There is always lots of action mixed but also a little educational value too (he mixes in some facts and explains at the end of the book).  I love all the characters in the series so far.  If you are looking for a great summer read, you should definitely pick this one up.
B00CLZ48FA|5.0|My husband, who is a great &#34;Oz&#34; fanatic, was extremely concerned when this movie came out and the reviews did little to ease his conscience.  But, watching the movie has made all the difference in the world.  It is a truly enjoyable movie that will transport you back to the wondrous land of Oz!  Enjoy!
B0050DIWFC|4.0|This was a quick read and would be a great choice for a book club due to all of the natural discussion points created.
B003BLPTB0|1.0|the shape of shoes is some bit abnormal，and there are a lot of mat impurities in the Groove on shoes
B0089LOG02|4.0|This novel taught me a lot about a part of American history not covered in history class. The plight of these orphans who are placed on trains and sent off to family who mostly wanted them as hired hands is well told. I would love to read any other books by this author.
B008KYOCA2|5.0|This is my favorite calendar!  I have tried others like this, but none compare.  I love that you can color code a box for a single event,  or color a whole row for events such as vacations.  My favorite part is the animated icons you can use...too adorable:0)
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I use it for everything. Lists, recipes, etc. I have it on my Kindle Fire, and use it practically every day.
B00C7DGQ9C|4.0|I was not that interested in the movie when it was released because I thought it was a pale copy of many other &#34;fairy tale&#34; movies. It's not. It's funny, but in situations.
B00B81B0HC|3.0|The songs are great... that is not the problem.. what is the problem though is the distortion in the music production...  I about blew out my speakers the first time..<br /><br />They need to re-do this music WITHOUT the distortion because with it, cranking it up is just not possible unless you want new speakers afterward.<br /><br />Whomever came up with that idea should be fired...
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|Until I read this book, I never realized Tina Fey has a facial scar, but that is neither here nor there. She is a very funny, very down to earth person and I appreciated her spin on life.
B005QYKE2Y|5.0|I watched this with my kids and I could not leave the set. I definitely will be watching the other movies in this series.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I had fun with this and will play it again.  Am looking forward to the next Room! I wish I didn't have to depend on the clues quite so much, but maybe I'll get better with practice.
B00CB4ET0K|4.0|I once experienced a sudden reset. However, I came back and played all over from the beginning. Simple control, fare graphic, very addictive. I would have given 5 stars if it didn't reset itself. Random freezing and shut down bothers me but Over all, good game.
B00BOXZAG6|4.0|Upside Down is a very pretty fairy tale; about two planets orbiting literally within arm's reach of each other. One is poor, the other is rich and they both have a unique environment where each planet has its own type of gravity. Into this plot device is thrown two lovers, one from the rich planet, the other from the poor. They meet when the boy climbs a mountain and looks up to see the girl walking up a hill on the other world.<br /><br />Boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy schemes to get girl back in this Topsy-turvey landscape in this very imaginative story.<br />This is a direct-to-video movie but it looks like a big budget production. The special effects are pretty well done and the film is gorgeous.<br /><br />Upside Down does lag in spots but it is well worth a look at least once.
B004NS710C|2.0|Seemed to be the typical story of whose going to actually stop this behemoth, and low and behold at the end the heroes revealed. Some well put together crash sequences but other than that kind of boring.
B00BUADSMQ|1.0|Puns:<br />\\"A Good Day To Watch Something Else\\"<br />\\"A Good Day To Listen To The Radio Instead of Watching This Movie\\"<br />\\"A Good Day For Bruce Willis To Stop Making Movies Like This\\"<br />\\"A Good Day To Pan This Movie\\"<br /><br />Despite all of the explosions, a 30 minute car chase and many loud gunfights, this movie wasn't that exciting.<br />The whole Chernobyl storyline was simply ridiculous.<br /><br />Watch it if you must, but for heaven's sake, DON'T buy this.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This app came up on my suggestions list...was bored downloaded to my fire HD. It is so addicting and fun to complete the rooms. Not into FB or Twitter..just play as guest. Still saves prizes.
B00CFA225Y|3.0|I really don't know what I was expecting to see. A big budget re-telling of \\"Jack and the Beanstalk\\" would seem to be a tough sell, and it was.<br />Technically, the film is very good - good special effects, decent acting, competent cinematography; but there is no real meat to the movie.<br />I can't imagine why anyone would pay $10+ to see this in a theater. And this film was not cheap to make.<br /><br />The ending hints at a sequel - fat chance..
B001BR3P0S|5.0|I love this movie haven't seen it in years and now my kids are watching it. We love love love it.
B0090SI4LU|2.0|How do you make a movie about an alien invasion boring? Ask the producers of this film.<br />The Host is a pretty interesting idea for a movie that goes nowhere, even the aliens look bored.<br /><br />Instead of brain-sucking, these small, glow worm-like aliens unpack their bags inside people's skulls, taking control over their human condos.<br />The movie centers around one nondescript human girl who gets evicted from her body but never leaves. Stuff happens, lots<br />of staring and talking to herself and she winds up befriending a group of \\"resistance fighters\\". More staring and Vangelis-type music,<br />and then there is a romantic triangle between the girl and two guys ZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz......<br /><br />The Host is not just boring, its unrealistic, even for a science *gag* fiction film.<br />Do you really think Beau and Zeke would hide in a mountain, growing wheat<br />during an invasion by glowy-eyed, pacifist aliens? Finding new ways to grill them Cajun-style maybe.<br />Everybody in this film acted like they were on Prozac. John Hurt plays the leader of the resistance. He says what is supposed to<br />be some wise stuff, but all I heard is \\"you are getting very sleepy, verrrrrry sleeepy...\\". ZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz........<br />I won't give away the ending, but anyone NOT under the control of an alien would have guessed the ending 15 minutes into the movie<br />anyway.<br /><br />However, the cinematography is very good and the movie is very relaxing - see it after getting a massage! But be careful, stop<br />the film before the closing credits or else you will be blasted by this brain jarring ditty by They Might Be Dragons, er, I mean<br />\\"Imagine Dragons\\" = \\"WELCOME TO THE NEW AGE, TO THE NEW AGE!!!!!!!!!!!!\\" - *gasp*. I almost flew out of my seat, I guess this was useful<br />to get people in theaters to wake up.<br /><br />2 stars - The Host is not an awful film, just awfully boring and pointless.
B00821OX98|3.0|Nothing really new here, like I said, The Walking Dead with aliens. I get very tired of both having so many characters being written so stupidly. Though constantly in jeopardy of being attacked at any given moment, people are too often portrayed walking around in a fog, stupidly drawing attention to themselves, etc. It gets old. How many times can a brain-dead zombie sneak up on you before you go, &#34; Hey, there's zombies here, maybe I ought to keep an eye out!&#34;
1401937268|5.0|These cards are very beautiful,but not importantly they are very accurate and easy to use.I highly reccomend these cards I have had great readings using these.
B005EGXTEE|5.0|Once i started reading, i couldnt put it down. highly recommend this book, has everything from action to teenage love.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|The update that most reviewers are not liking is more like I expected the Weather Channel App to be when considering the layout of their website--hey, change is an inevitable part of life but not always welcome especially when it is a surprise. I was actually disappointed when I loaded the former app on my Kindle Fire HD! The former version was just okay but did not feel as ad driven as the upgrade is. However, I like the layout of this new version much better. It is clean, attractive, and colorful. I especially like that I can save three favorite locations, which could not be done before. I am not really sure how I feel about the earning mPoints addition, but it can be ignored if that is not your thing.

B0087IT8FK|5.0|This is one of the sweetest, funniest and uplifting movies I've seen in a long time, and one of the few DVDs I've ever purchased.
B008JFUPK8|5.0|Amazing, thrilling, spectacular, electrifying, breathtaking and heart pounding.  Hands down, the best superhero movie of the year.  A dynamic roller coaster ride of a film that is, I dare say, as incredible as the original.
1781162646|5.0|Once again, Stephen King never ceases to amaze me........I get so trapped within his books, that I cant put them down....I tell myself<br />\\"next chapter, one more chapter, just one more\\"......and I just cant stop...<br />I have to admit, I was a little intimidated with this being a hard case crime, I have gotten use to Kings graphic, gory, weird imagination, and I felt like I was going to be thrown through a loop....HOWEVER, as I said in my first sentence, he NEVER CEASES TO AMAZE ME!!  Bravo...Bravo...Bravo  !!!
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|This is my favorite book of the series. I read all the previous books relatively quickly and became slightly impatient for closure of the various story lines. This final volume pulled everything together nicely without creating an unrealistically happy ending for all the characters. The ultimate battle between good and evil wasn't as challenging for the hero as I expected, but I'm glad everything worked out as it did. Definitely worth the read!
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|do not download this app i took a while to download after you got then after it wanted you to download something else it took forever to download why would you make an app like this
B00CEMH31Q|5.0|I'm an origonal Hanson fan.  To me, they can do no wrong. I'm so excited they are still producing new music!
B004J4WN0I|5.0|I was on vacation and needed something to read. I guess Amazon really does know me well because this book popped up on the recommended list for me. A couple of clicks on my Kindle and it was downloaded. Five hours later and with a fairly noticeable sunburn I was still kept completely enthralled in the story of a modern-day druid and his 20-century feud with a couple of old Irish gods. What do I like about this book?<br /><br />Dialogue - Kevin Hearne writes GREAT dialogue. Conversations flow naturally, are full of wit and humor, and never gets bogged down with literary contrivances. Even the druid's dog, Oberon, has  consistently witty dialogue. While this might sound trite, I'm telling you that this is one funny dog and I found myself laughing out-loud on a consistent basis.<br /><br />In addition to the smartest talking dog ever to appear in a novel, the author takes advantage of the fact that he has characters who in some cases are thousands of years ago and who are from a host of cultures. He gets to play with Old Irish, Norse, Ancient Greek, Finnish, Russian, Navajo and a range of other languages. Primarily this means that he gets to be VERY creative with insults and trash talking. If a 2500 year-old god is trash talking, he wouldn't just say 'bring it'. He would talk about your mother's privates, various farm animals she and your father had a particular fondness for, etc. and Hearne has a lot of fun with that.<br /><br />Magic - Hearne has thought through a consistent and compelling system of magic for his novels. Druidic magic, derived from Gaia, is based on seeing and manipulating the connections between natural things. As the oldest living human on the planet, Atticus O'Sullivan has had a lot of time to push the boundaries of what is possible with his abilities. Most of the old Gods are much diminished with time and the abandonment of their worshippers, though they still pack a punch and can hold grudges for eons.<br /><br />What was particularly fascinating was the interplay between belief systems. What happens when a druid, Jesus and some Cabalist warriors walk into a bar... You will find out in this series.<br /><br />Plot line - having read all six of the current books, I can tell you that they flow seamlessly from start to finish. You don't have to read all six. Book 1 is self-contained - you can pick it up, read through it and decide you're done. You won't but you could. Later books do carry over plot lines, sometimes with a gap of several years, sometimes with no time at all passing.<br /><br />Characters - when you have the entire history of humanity's gods, heroes, monsters and magic to play with, how can you go wrong? Well, some authors have managed to go wrong, but Hearne doesn't. You get characters from all major mythologies, including Jesus and Mary, vampires, werewolves, several species of giants, fairies, Valkyrie, possessed police detectives, witches, hot (as if there are any other kind) red-headed barmaids, fallen angels, a 'douche-bad' Thor along with a bunch of other Thunder Gods, Native American skin walkers, etc.<br /><br />So is Hearnes just copying from American Gods? No. Absolutely not. Are there some parallels? Sure. If I had to recommend Hounded or American Gods... I would go with Hounded. Hands down. Let the hate mail fly...g was the interplay between belief systems. What happens when a druid, Jesus and some Cabalist warriors walk into a bar...

B000QI2ZWW|5.0|Each year in kindergarten, we take a journey to the poles in Janary to learn about the coldest regions of the earth and the animals that live there.  This is the best movie for children to enjoy, but also learn some specific facts about the penguins.  After this we watch &#34;March of the Penguins&#34; and see how the same facts are portrayed in a non-fiction movie with real footage.  Definitely recommend for families and classrooms.
B009R659L8|5.0|Best Book I have read in a long time. Could not lay it down. One of her very best novels
B0036BK6MW|5.0|The big reason I like it so much, it was a true story. I think it was overall a great movie .I loved it soooooooooooooooo much.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|This book is a very nice mix between an informational source and a first person account of one mans journey to learn how to run better. The author does an amazing job of interweaving the two, keeping you interested at all times.
B0075MFS9Y|4.0|Listened to it again on my way home from work.  I sort of thought it had a similar sound of lots of others I enjoy listening to...David Grey, Mumford and Sons, Dave Matthews.  You probably think I'm daft, but had a sound I like from all of them.
B00AVFO41K|1.0|This game is boring. I understand that it is a no win situation. Even on easy, the game was impossible with in two minutes. The balls pop up so fast after every move and in such big quantity, that no game could last very long. It seems the game was nit put together very well at all, just read the description. I have deleted thus app and I can not recommend this application to anyone because unless you enjoy losing and being bored at the same time, it isn't worth it and I wouldn't pay $0.99 or even get if it is the free app of the day.
B007A2O3FO|5.0|This was a really sweet movie.  Especially if you love &#34;all things British&#34; as I do.  Written by the same Downton Abby author and director.  Loved the cast and scenery.
B000FBJHZS|4.0|Brown has written another fast-paced thrilling book. I could not guess the outcome even towards the the end.  I'm looking forward to more books by this author.
B0063GORYU|5.0|This Spider game is excellent. The app loads and runs smoothly.The ads aren't annoying. The graphics are great and there are several choices for the cards. The only thing I would add is a pause button.
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|It's a fun action flick and it was great to finally learn more about these characters and see them together, but the story feels kind of short and if anything I want more.
0425263991|5.0|I didn't get excited about this book's summary.  I didn't think I'd love this book as I have many of the other books in this series but I was wrong.  This book is slow build book...the tension more emotional than action packed (although there is action)...and I fell in love.<br /><br />What I find wonderful about her books are that characters remain who they are. Kaleb isn't a heart and flowers sort of guy.  He's not naturally kind or compassionate. He isn't a warm fuzzy guy and he doesn't become one but he managed to show love without gutting the character. Many authors can't manage that.  And Kaleb manages to be both an alpha male and be able to give Sahara space...even when he did not want to. I love that man.<br /><br />Its a wonderful emotional book.<br /><br />A yes!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I enjoy keeping up with relatives & friends, enjoy all the pictures!  People also share good recipes & inspiring stories.
B0002ZDVEU|1.0|i dont see why everyone loves this series it is boring and leaves u with even more questions after every movie
1442486929|5.0|Holly Black and Tony DiTerlizzi began publishing The Spiderwick Chronicles series TEN YEARS AGO. Color me surprised! And old. I didn't read the books when they came out - I was just starting college and hadn't yet reached my rediscovery phase for young adult and middle grade books. I do remember seeing the film, though - on the plane, I think (and many times since on TV). When Simon & Schuster sent me a copy of the 10-year anniversary edition of the first in the series, The Field Guide, I knew I'd need to read it and form my own impressions of this new classic.<br /><br />The Spiderwick Chronicles series stars the three Grace siblings, who have moved from the city to a rickety old house in the country after their parents' divorce. Older sister Mallory is obsessed with fencing and is very pragmatic (and suspicious!). Simon is one of the twins, and his main goal in life seems to be to collect as many types of animals as possible. Jared Grace is the curious one, the troublemaker, and the main character. When the children discover that all is not as it seems in their new (old) house, adventures ensue. Because something doesn't want them knowing the secrets of the Spiderwick estate.<br /><br />The Field Guide is very much an introduction to the characters and their surroundings, but it also contains a concise mystery and sets the stage for continuing adventures. The writing is perfect for lower-end middle grade readers (and those who read aloud to children ages 6-8), and there are accompanying illustrations of fantastical creatures and other, more mundane objects on almost every page. DiTerlizzi's artwork fires the imagination and adds layers of story to the text. The result is beautiful as well as entertaining. The Spiderwick Chronicles should serve as a perfect stepping stone into fantasy, even for those who believe they don't like the genre.<br /><br />Jared Grace's story (and frustration) is universal, and his dawning curiosity about the natural (and supernatural) world will light up the imaginations of readers who have long since abandoned belief in the wondrous and unseen. I found the book a charming and brief interlude in a place where fairies are real and clever children might be able to learn about them.<br /><br />Recommended for: fans of Hayao Miyazaki's film My Neighbor Totoro, readers who enjoyed Neil Gaiman's Odd and the Frost Giants, and anyone who might be a little young yet to independently read C.S. Lewis' Chronicles of Narnia.<br /><br />(review originally posted at: [...]rld will light up the imaginations of readers who have long since abandoned belief in the wondrous and unseen.

B00D2K40WY|3.0|i think it was ok because everything is locked u have like a few choices of hair or dresses. It wa  fun to play though.
B00A81NFAS|5.0|Lawrence's performance was outstanding. You have to be mature to get this movie, sorry but that's the true. David O' Russel as always did such a great and beautiful job. I just love everything about this story, the book is also great. Read it too!
B001NHNG64|3.0|Still reading, but really a action figure. Some places in book is a little far out. But still very goo as far as I am
B0090SI4OC|2.0|I read this book Twice and honestly, I loved it. It was pretty amazing and I was excited about the movie but I have to say, that movie was horrible, It is hard to say it cause I'm a huge fan but that's the true. I'd rather read the book one more time than watch this movie again. The only good thing was Saoirse Ronan.
B00957T6X6|3.0|but if you don't know who done it about a 1/4 of the way thru you need to turn in your mystery reader club card.
0553801473|4.0|I am not fond of the way the books are laid out or the prose is written. In fact I am almost through them a second time.  I didn't remember much about each book. I had read. There are so many characters - each chapter is from several characters points of view. No tie ins from character to character.  Very hard to remember. The timelines don't follow in any sort of continuity or .  straight line.  First time I have seen any type of story written like this. Very cumbersome. I tried to read the Books my Granddaughter recommended.  They are also fantasy and the format is the same. It is difficult to keep track of what people are doing. In fact, The author does write good scenes.  He has the ability to write memorable prose. With a cast of thousands I don't know how else he could have preserved a straight out story.  Too bad because the scope of the thing is massive - I remember the Classics read as a girl but these books are difficult, to follow. And difficult to remember. No frame of reference. Perhaps all fantasy is presented this way? . Some of the lovely scenes are lost because of the technique used... I have no idea what the author could have done?.  I am amazed he kept his sanity writing about all these characters.  Better for transition into movie scripts.. Perhaps having the prose as a screenplay was for this reason. After all, the man is a multimillionaire now.  Can't argue with that can we? .Love the TV series.
0760703329|5.0|I was impressed with the looks of this book.  I gave it to my brother for a christmas present and he was very pleased with it.
B008220BLG|5.0|I loved it and am waiting for my copy of the book! I can only imagine how good it will be compaired to the script!
B0064X7FVE|1.0|Upgraded automatically.  I loved this app but hate the upgrade.  Too busy.  Hate the tokens/Twitter crap.  What a shame.  Am deleting and looking elsewhere for a weather app.
B000OLRH10|5.0|This was the second time watching it and I still loved it.  Great acting, drama and full entertainment.  Must see if you're an Leonardo fan.
B001HBYHFA|5.0|All i can say is this movie is a must own... The world of firefly/serenity is unique and wonderful !!!
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I haven't looked at my dog the same since I've read this book.  I'm always wondering what he's thinking.  A must read!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|the game is so much fun. having fun watching the little ones play around and enjoy it so much. great game for all kids
B0040I09RM|5.0|I can't believe it took me this long to start watching. After each episode ends I just cannot wait to watch the next one.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|I really enjoyed the pace of this movie.  The acting was great and a few surprises along the way.  The ending was especially surprising.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|One of the best books I've ever read, you get so lost in the story it comes alive.<br />A must read.
B004R10N6O|5.0|Great story about dedication and an unwillingness to give up.  The directing on Ford's character was off, but the rest easily made up for it.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Just challenging enough. Keep checking the room and you'll figure it out. . I haven't had to cheat yet, I'm glad I downloaded this.
B001NA6096|4.0|Charming characters and dialogue, but not entirely believable.<br /><br />One knows they will not keep their promise to meet again at the same place.
B005544TRQ|5.0|I always thought the show looked interesting but never caught it on tv. Just finished season 1 and I am in love with this show! The characters are great, each episode is interesting and funny. And I think I want to marry Harvey. Love it!
B004PLT3TY|4.0|Great, funny performances .  As good as MIB for taking a genre and making it lightly farcical yet serious enough to genuinely care about all of the characters.
B003H4I4JU|5.0|I feel like I know these characters better than any others I've read about, and I care about them on a completely different level. Card's writing style and word choice is eloquent and not &#34;dumbed down&#34;. As far as it being a sequel for &#34;Enders Game&#34;, it is a completely different kind of book. It makes allusions to past events of course, but where the other seemed more like a &#34;Sci-fi book&#34; this was a legitimate novel. It teaches about the human heart, the power of understanding and loving yourself and your enemies, and very creatively gives us an outside observers perspective of the human race. I would certainly recommend this book and look forward to reading many more works by this author.
B00AVFO41K|4.0|A nice little match/puzzle game. I have played many games like this in the past... and this is a nice simple version. This isn't a game you are going to &quot;win&quot; so to speak. This is a puzzle game where you play to beat your own score. I can get caught up in this and play for hours before I lose. I love the fact that it is a fairly simple design, without too many bells and whistles. I get tired of apps where the developers have added too many extra features that really don't add anything to the game, and just end up eating up my battery. I only gave 4 stars because there is no instruction page and it doesn't show you how many dots are going to show up each time. It seems to be a random number of dots added after each move.
B004I4H8QS|5.0|I really am not a music critic, I just love this feelings this music gives me, the outpouring of emotion is wonderful.
B004UID2LC|5.0|I lovw this app.I just downloaded five videos and it worked perfectly. Thank you for this great app.I highly recommend this app.
B0075MFS9Y|3.0|This is ok music, just not quite what I expected after seeing them on the Grammy's where they did a great job.  It was the only music of theirs that I had heard and ordered this after seeing that show.
B00821OX98|3.0|Another one of the survival at the end of the world but really, couldn't you have made a little more interesting aliens?  I can imagine all the creators sitting around the drafting board and trying to make the most repulsive character they could think of.  Why not something a little innovative guys!  Can't say I am wild about it.
B0025KVLU6|5.0|I have been collecting several Beatles CDs over the years. This is one I wanted for a long time. I was a little too young to follow groups very closely back in the day but I heard the music and loved it, even though like most people I didn't have a clue what most of the songs meant.
B00AB7HESI|2.0|It installs just fine, opens up just fine, and plays just fine... Until it's time to create an object. You can not spawn any objects with the Samsung Galaxy Note 2. The graphics and movement are well done and smooth and the music is pleasant, but just make sure you have a proper device.
B00AVFO41K|1.0|It doesn't even come with instructions or a tutorial on how to play.  I deleted it after about 2 minutes.
B001FB55M6|5.0|GREAT MOVIE! HAD ME AND MY WIFE INI STICHES LAUGHING SO MUCH IT HURT! LOVE JIM CARREY HOWEVER DON'T LIKE HIS RECENT VIEWS ON THE 2ND AMENDMENT
B00364K6YW|5.0|I'm a total fanatic about Pride & Prejudice, Elizabeth's attitude is just amazing. But, anyway, the mini-series is to my liking... or loving. Nothing will make me think this seller deserves a bad review!
B005PSG4JS|1.0|i have always been a boxing buff and had sympathy for rubin carters &#34;railroading&#34; until i read this book. it reeks of self serving lies. it is a little convenient that he experiences racism and superiority by whites in his life, but when he meets this &#34;hasson&#34; character all the sudden he believes blacks are superior in all aspects. rubin carter is a racist, an opportunist, and from other research possibly a real participant in the lafayette grill murders. please do your own research before paying a cent to this man. and yes i am a cracker.
B008N1V11U|5.0|This game is awesome it takes so long that you get to enjoy it for so long then you can just restart
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Almost anyone who loves nature, I was also touched by the maternal love of the parents for their child. Shocked by what the mother had previously been through.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Good book, very in-depth, good build up and overall a good way to help with your zombie plan. Also nothing like the movie.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a fun and addicting game. But took me awhile to get the hang of it but once I did had a blast with it. Love it.
B002436WFI|5.0|\\"The Color of Magic\\" follows the zany and quirky adventures of a wizard and his reluctant assistant as they end up in one crazy incident after another. Events become even more interesting when the men meet a gifted but abrasive wizard who has little qualms about how he treats others in his quest for more power. The addition of the archetype of the Death character also adds a unique twist to the movie's plot.  The following actors/actresses are among those featured in \\"The Color Of Magic\\": Sean Astin, Christopher Lee,David Jason,  Jeremy Irons, Brian Cox, David Bradley, Janet Suzman,Tim Curry, Laura Haddock, Nigel Planner, Karen David, James Cosmo, Liz Brice, and Stephen Marcus.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|Doo much better compared to the classic mohong..keeps your brain going and is very competitive towards one's self. Definitely recommend this to anyone who enjoys a game.
B00000JPH6|5.0|I admit that I had only heard of `The Dark Crystal\\" because of my husband owning this dvd (which he has now done so for at least over ten years). \\"The Dark Crystal\\" is an uncommon film that involves a being named Jen who must simultaneously help to save his world from darkness. He is on a quest to find the crystal shard and must be careful to do it while evading the skekses.  Jen ends up getting a little help on his journey when he meets Kira. Obviously, there is much more to this story and \\"The Dark Crystal\\" is great for those who enjoy fantasy movies.
B004I744AS|2.0|Unwieldy to use . Not suitably straight forward for anyone of beginner or intermediate level bot probably ok for fluent speakers
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I love this game! My daughter and I try to beat each others high scores. But I'm having trouble connecting to Facebook. Why?
B006M3JVD6|4.0|Written as a conversation that jumps back and fourth, which is refreshing. Some parts I wanted to just skip because they were so awful. I wish her all the best and think she is inspirational!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Think this is a great mind game.  I really enjoy figuring out all of the clues!  I hope there are more rooms with extra challenges!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is super awsome you have to play this game it's da bomb you should really play it don't think about it just get it it's that cool.
B003R4ZMJU|5.0|I loved the mystery, the suspense, and the dynamic of the characters. The actors really brought that to life and I had a fun time  watching it
B005544TRQ|4.0|I am not a big tv watcher in terms of viewing every show that airs. But I do enjoy a select group including Downton Abbey, Law & Order, Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives, Lincoln Heights, just to name a few. Now, I am happy to say, I can add Suits to my short list. It is intriguing and it keeps you on the edge of you seat because it is not predictable. Try it you just might like it.
B00BP4X7TG|5.0|I took a chance on this based on other reviews and was not sorry. It is very touching and has quite a bit of humor also.
B0084FMD3A|5.0|I've been a fan of Teva Tanzas for over a year, but I discovered them at a local retail store that had them priced at $110.00 and then offered me a &#34;deal&#34; at $85.00, their &#34;rock bottom price.&#34;<br /><br />While I loved the sandal, which is great for me and about all I can wear due to having edema, I decided to see what Amazon could do for me.<br /><br />Try delivering a much lower &#34;rock bottom&#34; price. Even with shipping, I paid $20 less on Amazon than I paid for last year's at-retail pair. And local retail wonders why folks choose online shopping...
B00CGPPMKU|3.0|This is the first app that I have PAID for since getting a Kindle Fire HD. When I first tried this, I liked what it did.  Unfortunately, after saving my first \\"creation\\", the app will not let me save anything else. Program crashes when I try to save. My first one wasn't all that good, but now that I know how it works, I have some work I'd like to save and use....  BUT I CAN'T!<br />(I WOULD have given it 5 stars... sorry. Now it's just a frustrating toy.)
B00BFUUMO8|2.0|The game is fun and simple, but when you reach the higher levels there is much less to do...I haven't got new DNA in 3 weeks! Update: once you reach level 109, you're done..no more missions therefore no more xp points and no advancement...what a waste
B003VANOFY|5.0|The most comfortable headset I have worn ever. I am super picky with my computer interface devices and Logitech has been crowned the king of my computer with their G series devices. I have a G15 keyboard that has lasted over 5 years, a G700 mouse that I bought to replace my old G9X, and now the G930 Wireless Gaming Headset. Logitech has never disappointed me with their products, and I will forever be confident in their quality.<br /><br />I have been through 3 different headsets that I grew tired of:<br /><br />TRITTON TRI-GA611<br />Turtle Beach DX12<br />Plantronics Gamecom<br /><br />They all had killer sound output, but the main issue was comfort and cords. The Tritton had 2 AC ADAPTERS. The Plantronics would make my head sweat like crazy, and the Turtle Beach had hard foam ear-cups that were not comfortable after about an hour of use.<br /><br />I switched to Logitech because I had a friend who suggested it, and they are amazing. The wireless leaves no disappointment in audio output, and I have been wearing them for about 6 hours now with no issue in comfort. It integrates with the Logitech Gaming Software that my mouse and keyboard are already interfaced with and it was an instant plug and play experience.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Wireless 7.1 Dolby<br />-Excellent volume and bass + Equalizer functions in the software.<br />-Flipping up the mic will auto mute, great for when you want to eat something and don't want your friends to hear you chomp and slurp.<br />- 3 programmable G-keys that you can set to do different things in different games.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- The audio sounds a bit hollow at first, but it is easily fixed in the equalizer.
B007EC27QM|5.0|I will keep this one. It is Very helpful when needed. Good at calculating. Anything it can do well. Thanks.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Great series.  Can't wait for season four to unfold--will the new maid get to Tom?  What will that snake Thomas pull?
B00ADQCBEY|2.0|If one is interested in sitting down and relaxing with a television show at the end of the day, I would not recommend &#34;The Shield&#34;.  The acting is good and the story line is decent.  However, the violence and the unnecessary sexual content (nude buttocks) detract from the program.  There is enough violence in &#34;real&#34; life everyday on the news and in the newspapers.  I would not opt to immerse myself in more for entertainment purposes.
1594136467|5.0|So glad I could get this in large print for us &#34;seniors&#34;.  Haven't finished the book but so far it is so interesting.
B000JMKRKC|5.0|I got this book as an advertised special on Kindle. By the time I had read the first few pages I was overwhelmed by the writing.  The story was a good one but it was the author's skill that had me hooked.  I anxiously await the next tome...
B009LMTDL0|5.0|Parts of this book were painful for me as I recognize behaviors and feelings that continue to hold women back--and much of it is inspirational and full of really applicable ideas for women and men. Most of all I appreciate the sense of encouragement Sandberg conveys in every chapter.
B00006NSGX|5.0|Really shows his versatility.  Nice solos.  Very tight band.  The keyboardists add an exceptionally nice flair, both the B3 and the synth.
B000X5SPBI|5.0|even thought dean dies in this one still love the show and would like to own all the seasons just need 3 more to go
0385342071|2.0|I enjoyed this book but I can't say I would recommend it.  The story and the characters are weak and completely predictable, but cute and amusing at the same time.  What really threw the book for me was the ending - so utterly saccharine it plays out like a bad rom-com chick flick.  I think it could have been written a little differently, but considering the genre, I suppose you can never expect too much.
B002JVWRAO|5.0|I have been with this show from the very beginning I loved it I want to get all the seasons just need 3 more
B0050DIWFC|2.0|After many recommendations and noting it was on the best seller list, I read it.  It was a disappointment and not a good read at all.  Story line was confusing.  Writing style was disjointed.  Sorry I wasted my time when there are so many other good books waiting to be read.
B001FB4W0C|5.0|I want to have all the season, I love this show very much I now just need 3 more season
1490313370|2.0|I really feel sorry for this author although he has had many successes.  I heard several great reviews and recommendations from some very successful people, so I bought it.  Because I read books I finished it, but it wasn't worth the money paid.  There are a some good valid points that can help a person turn their life around although they are found amongst a whole lot of depressing outlooks on life.<br /><br />I personally am unable to take anyone serious who is unable to express themselves without cussing, which this author is unable to do.  However, i am sure he could make a list as to why I am wrong.
B003G8Y4QO|5.0|Only the Dr can make you laugh ,keep you sitting on the edge of your seat and make you want more all at the same time. Dizzying show that makes you want.it to hurry and end.so you can see how it turned out & disappoint you bc it's over. Yet you get excited at the thoughts of a new episode. I heard this is the last season for The Dr. Sooo disappointed.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This was the first book I ever ordered/read on amazon kindle. It was worth it! I was addicted to it and ready all 3 books several times!
B005544TRQ|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this series. I'm watching the second series too. Almost as good as a John Grisham book, and that's hard to beat.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book was worth it. I liked it better than the first one, but the third is still my favorite! I have read the trilogy several times now!
034580404X|5.0|I was enthralled from page one to the end.  I liked it so well that I am reading it again.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Love the backlighting of the display. It's perfect for reading on planes without turning on the overhead light. It's also very light.
B00CF34B2I|1.0|DELETED.  I just checked it out.  It's just another &quot;innocent&quot; game to lure people into the world of witchcraft, spells and such. Parents should be watching what their kids are playing.  But then a lot of parents think this is OK.
B005WUHAX8|2.0|if you love you iphone don't use this product. it did not seal properly and now my iphone is ruined. I did exactly what the directions said and water still got in. I wouldn't trust any water device. water and electronics don't mix!
B0091W7MP4|5.0|I had already seen this movie  some time ago, but I loved this one enough to watch it again!  Both Holly Hunter and Sigourney were in good form in their roles.  Holly lured Sigourney into joining the killer search while Sigourney resisted...great twosome!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Loved the continuation of the love story.  Did not like how the ending did not really end anything.  Now I have to wait for the next installment, hopefully quickly.
B006BAEQB2|5.0|Just as fascinating and gripping as Philippa Gregory's other novels. She makes history come alive in a completely understanding and intriguing way.
1439153663|3.0|Actually 3.5 stars. The story moved along at a nice pace. Switching back and forth between Belle and Lavinia, a style which can be sometimes confusing or gets the story off track, added to the story, in this case, giving it additional depth. Lavinia's character was too naïve for me and too self obsessed at times putting her adopted family and herself in danger. I found this trait annoying. The plot was somewhat predictable although I did appreciate the twist at the end which wasn't a pat ending. This was a book club selection and everyone enjoyed this read.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Great read. Completely different take on the zombie genre.  The stories of survival and man's determination to fight are simply amazing.
B00B2166BS|5.0|it seems to charge the Nexus in 1/2 the time and on top of that it is magnetic no more ripping cables out of the socket!
B004EC5IUW|5.0|This movie is amazing the art work and story line are just right on target. The only issue I had with it was my product did not come in the best condition possible. The front cover of the box looks like it was sitting on the sun for too long and has some very visible crinkles.
B00CGPPMKU|5.0|Flowpaper is so easy to use and I have fun drawing pictures with it. I also like the way the brushes can be changed to different colors as well. It brings my designs to life.
B007N8RULO|3.0|try it you'll like it,I keep playing ang playing. nice quite game to play when you just want to relax
B009UX2YAC|3.0|I like this game but I think it's weird that when a train is comming out a object. :-) is if as data hfgxiggdiggdjggdyffs this facades :-) bcjgvchvvccndc dc uvbcutyffugdg h vs h gang xxx xxx in dc dc dc dc D.C. dc f2f f2f f2f uhh duyryrviv
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|if you played the other angry birds you will love this one some are real hard but you will make it.
B00AWJYJVA|4.0|A typical John Le Carre story. Its played out at a hundred miles an hour, with the reader breathless by the finished. i expected a twist but would never have guessed the outcome. Very enjoyable.
B00CH26TL8|5.0|I was sooo happy when I found I was able to download this on my kindle since I'm an avid player on Facebook. Good app!
0615782043|4.0|This is the 2nd erotic biography i have read and i must say it is a different approach to a biography. Just as the last author didn't disappoint though, neither did GPA. his style of poetry is unique to him. Once you know his style you recognize his work. This journey into his erotic world, wasn't brash, or over the top. it wasn't page after page of purely sex scenes, it was a tastefully writen, erotic tale and he did a great job in his lines. THANK YOU for sharing and for the journey.
B005C8ENI0|4.0|It is different movie. The plot is interesting. We liked it bery much. I will recommend to watch it if you like legal cases.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|I bought this game while back paid $.99 for it and it didn't work with any devices I owned :/ and amazon made it where my devices were compatible and I have been wanting to place this game since I found out about this game which was about 6 months ago! And I was like dang sucks it cost $6.99 I was really bummed out about it and I am happy with my purchase I love the game! Just getting the hang of it and having a crud load of fun with the game! :) it is worth the $6.99 but I got a deal on it so I am glad I did the deal which at the time I wasn't because I bought it and realized it didn't work with any devices I had :/ which this game has amazing graphics for a handheld device! :) it works on my galaxy s epic 4g phone! :) loving this game so much!
B005Q1W10A|5.0|I expected to like the series because I love British Period Drama. I was not disappointed.  The costumes and settings are beautiful, the characters are strong, and the story lines are interesting.  I love Maggie Smith in her part!
1451629192|5.0|Once I started reading the book I couldn't put it down. Absolutely riveting story that is almost unbelievable. Buy it!
B00BQHA06A|5.0|My only complaint is that this album is too short. Being a die hard HIM fan and owning every album including a majority of imported versions, I can honestly say this is one of the most complete cds I've ever heard, never do you get an urge to skip past any tracks, the album can be listened to repeatedly from track 1 to 13.
B00CRWJ5GO|4.0|Kind of a hard movie to follow. You really have to pay attention. I like it because it's not the same regurgitated garbage that Hollywood has been putting out
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Brandon Sanderson has done a masterful job of finishing Robert Jordan's epic series. This is the book I have waited years to read, and I was not disappointed!
B00AE2J5HI|4.0|It's a movie. It's worth watching I wouldn't spend a lot on it but it's an alright flick. Check it out.
B00785P2QC|4.0|This game is fun. Money creation could be smoother and the tutorial could use more clarity. The least frustrating of the city game with ample opportunity to avoid spending money you dont want to.
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|You definitely need to see this this movie. Absolutely astonishing. Very realistic.I'm going to give this a ten out of ten.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Another great story by Hosseini. The story captivated me throughout and brought me to tears at the end. Can't wait his next book.
B006GECE9Y|4.0|Use it all the time on my phone and my Kindle. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a browser.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I am so in love with this show and all the characters,just finished season 3 and I am ready for season 4,one if my absolute favorites
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|It's mind-boggling just how far-reaching this app really is.  I'm not sure what I ever did without it.  Have plans to extend its use and cut down the clutter.
B006T5LGXA|5.0|Show was recorded live on September 29, 2011 at the Alexandra Palace in London, UK. Simply cannot get enough of this 2-CD live release as I thoroughly soaked in the usual Cooper staples like \\"I'm Eighteen\\", \\"Under My Wheels\\", \\"Billion Dollar Babies\\" (still dig seeing this track played live - as Uncle Alice always tosses fake dollar bills - with his mug photo-shopped on the funny money - out to the crowd), \\"Only Women Bleed\\" [so glad he isn't played this ballad on his current trek], the modern-day Cooper classic \\"Feed My Frankenstein\\" and \\"Poison\\". Maybe it's just me but his new song \\"I'll Bite Your Face Off\\" kicks total ass. As I spun these discs for a third time in less than a week's time - I also loved hearing his (much welcomed) additions \\"Halo Of Flies\\", \\"Muscle Of Love\\", a tune that he hasn't played live in over thirty years now \\"Clones\\", a bit of \\"I Love The Dead\\", his anthem \\"School's Out\\" (never gets old, does it?) and a finale that I certainly did not expect - Arthur Brown stepping out on stage giving the appreciative crowd his 1968 smash hit \\"Fire\\". You can see this song on fan videos on You Tube. One thing I do not get is - why didn't Alice share a couple of line(s) from Brown's live performance of \\"Fire\\"? At least as must of a must-have as his 'Theatre Of Death' CD / DVD. Be sure to check out a couple of archive Alice Cooper live releases - 'Alone In His Nightmare' and 'Live in San Diego' of which I believe both these shows were initially broadcasted as FM live radio shows.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|loved the difficulty level of this game. it was challenging but not impossible. wish there were more floors though. the game didn't last very long.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|I wish I would have watched this yeas ago a great show!! I think anyone who watches will be very surprised how good this show really is.
B0063IH60K|4.0|It's just great ,works a treat looks very pleasing. I think it is excellent in most aspects it jumps well , and does not rely on luck alone to make if enjoyable.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I think that this is a good game.It teaches the importance of animal care.Kids can learn the responsibility to take care of something,I log it
B006MW3V6U|4.0|This series is filled with drama and had me hooked immediately.  I love the nice characters and love to hate the mean ones.  Maggie Smith's character is hilarious.<br /><br />I am thrilled that Amazon Prime offers so many videos at no additional cost, it is a complete bonus that I was not expecting.  I find that the video quality is better on my iPad but just ok on my Mac Book.  Wish it could be a little more clear as the scenes and the costumes are beautiful.  None the less, I will continue to watch because this series is so great.
B00B5AP7NY|5.0|Kids watched it so many times! I like the extra mini figure that was included. It went great with the sets he already has.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|It is a great game, but it is hard to control the car. It is so bouncie, and it is kind of gross when the car flops over upside down and I think the guy brakes his neck when it happens. Otherwise I like the game.<br /><br />  ~THANK YOU FOR READING MY REVIEW~
076780421X|5.0|This movie is my wife's favorite. It is funny, cute and entertaining. How can you not love a movie with Matthew Perry when he was funny.
B007F5SG22|5.0|I became a Muslim some 30 years ago and had recently begun questioning much of the doctrine and beliefs. I could not call myself any kind of expert on the religion as I followed only some of the tenets of the faith but had a very western liberal attitude to Islam. Ayann Hirsi Ali has convinced me of the problems within this religion and its massive failures to its followers because of the resistance to change, to reformation. I thank her from the bottom of my heart for taking the risk of death to inform me about Islam.<br />I would have liked her to have included the Surah and verse number within the Koran when she made reference to it so I could have looked up the text and read the exact words. However I would rate this book as one of the most influential books I have ever read.
B00C7O8TSM|5.0|Amazing CD of maybe the last time, Brian and Mike share the stage. If you are a Boys fan, you should pick it up.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Who didn't know that! Can't wait for the next two movies to come out! I have watched this one over and over and love it! If you are a die hard LOTR fan then you will love the Hobbit. The making of the movie blogs on Youtube are also a great accompaniment to this movie!! Gives you real insight to the scenes and filming, narrated by none other that Peter himself. Truly extraordinary, and as usual, the New Zealand scenery is breathtaking...can't wait for the extended versions! Go Peter!
B002ECN4P0|4.0|The CD arrived within a few days and the quality was very good . And it is The Rolling Stones :)
B009O07NDY|5.0|This CD is even MORE than I was hoping for...aside from the wonderful tracks/music of Howard Shore, the CD package is like a book, with many pages and pictures, as well as the words to all the songs in the movie!!  I am VERY impressed and can't say enough...Just buy it! (don't forget there are two discs!)
B00CATSONE|4.0|I enjoyed reading about this man.  Learned things I didn't know.  Would love to read more about him.  Very interesting read.
B007GFDVEE|5.0|Bought this as a gift for my son and he absolutely loves it!! Also we received shipment in a timely manner.Bought this as a gift for my son and he absolutely loves it!! Also we received shipment in a timely manner.
B000641D2Y|5.0|I watched it as a kid and wanted my kids to watch it. Just as funny as I remember. One of our family favorites.
0425263924|5.0|Many of the low ratings are not based upon the book, but based on anger derived from the fact that this was supposed to be a trilogy, and the publishers are aiming to make more cash out of its success.<br /><br />This is actually a very well written novel.  The story is well thought out, and the characters are never boring.  It moves along at a very steady pace, and you don't find yourself feeling confused with forgotten details.<br /><br />This is Silvia Day, so of course she's got a whole great big bunch of kinky sex, but these Crossfire novels are the first where she has proven there is a reason she gets the title of author, and not just sex narrator.<br /><br />These reviews are supposed to be based upon the actual story, and NOT the frustration with the continuation of said story.<br /><br />All three books are excellent novels.  The first book in the series was the absolute best.  Entwined in You is actually better than the second in the series, and they were all very good.  You'll enjoy the read.  You will feel a desire to finding out the ending to all of this friendship/ familial connection / sexual attraction, and psychiatric chaos.  But the story will do what the publishing house wanted it to do; you will go out and buy the next book.  You won't be able to just walk away without discovering the conclusion to it all.<br /><br />My suggestion to Sylvia Day, unless you want some angry militant readers to continue to destroy the ratings on your books, finish this series.  People only survive so long with hunger pains before they feel the need to attack.<br /><br />For future stories, continue with this pattern.  These books showcase a talent, and I hope you continue to nourish the storytelling, and don't go back to simply sex without true narrative.
B00785P2QC|3.0|This idea is decent but megapolis is better just not available for kindle. But this was the closest game to it so I downloaded it.
B008KYOCA2|5.0|I found it very practical and useful for all my scheduling,plans with very easy accessibility.thank you for providing this wonderful service.
B00DBSZEH2|4.0|Good action and great story - loved Edward the troll.<br /><br />Would watch it again so I rated it a 4.
B00886XQO0|4.0|It works great and looks even better. I like the quality a lot. The &#34;simulated surround sound&#34; with the wireless DSP is pretty darn good for only having a single driver per ear. I bought it mostly for Gears of War and it works great. I hear enemies coming up in a particular direction way before my friend has any idea and is yelling &#34;where is he!? I can't see him or hear where he's coming from!&#34; Mean while I know where he's coming from long before we can even see the enemy.
B007VDN1PA|4.0|This machine works well, however the plastic film strip holders scratch very easily and when you have hundreds of negatives to scan it will take a lot of replacement holders.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|Love this show it never disappoints . Great writing and a great cast. A must have for any fan. Sure beats summer programming and so simple to access through amazon video.
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|the re's a problem with the kindle edition with every game not as good as the other additions but it's the finest game of halfbrick
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Since i have not used this application myself, i can't give a proper review.  I haven't heard any complaints from him about it, though!
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|SINCE I GOT IT I'VE PLAYED IT EVERY DAY ITS JUST AMAZING WOW WOW WOW YEAH THAT'S RIGHT I LOVE IT ITS ADDICTINGLY AWSOME AND THE AQUATIC AREA

B002NWXRYY|5.0|Steve Martin and Goldy Hawn make an awesome comedic team. IMO this is Steve's funniest movie, outside of &#34;The Jerk&#34; ?  And Goldie never looked better, she was an absolute knock out in this movie..
B00061HJ4S|4.0|A nice classic Tamiya kit with lots of goodies, including a Zundapp motorcycle, rider, and gun crew. A little bit more &#34;flash&#34; that required trimming than on other Tamiya kits I've built. Overall, very satisfying and fun to build.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|New update is horrible. Was simple to use and very user friendly. Now it's cluttered and more complicated. Could \\"learn\\" to like this new version, but I'd rather just take this chance to find a new one. Uninstalling.
B00AOCLWF6|5.0|Excellent sci-fy show.  price was right and recommend to all.  characters are interesting as is story line.  makes you think could this really happen?
B000SFJWLU|4.0|All the songs are great but one song skipped due to the cd being used however the cd bought brand new is awesome
B00CHSPB8Y|3.0|I really can't rate this one as my seven year old son is the one who purchased and plays with it.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|One of the best war games on the app store. Love to build,fight, and BUY. I would highly recommend downloading it.
B00BB22GQM|5.0|The band has really grown up. If you did not care for the first two albums, like me, or if you're a die hard Vampire Weekend fan, listen to \\"Modern Vampires\\" and you will not stop.  Fantastic Album and I hope a promise of good things to come from this band.
B0037QGS0K|5.0|the heading says it all! a deep erotic thriller about trust, seduction, lies, family and a HOT, very HOT sex scene between Amanda Seyfried and Julianne Moore that is worth the cost!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|English/Scottish brouges are my Favorite, especially series, so I can watch marathon style, a season a week. I am retired and really enjoy getting the whole flavor all at once over just one episode a week. The Downton Abbey family exhibits great integrity through most episodes, to my liking.<br />Having only one episode offered from season 3 is just an annoying tease , I will wait to watch when the whole season is available.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|It's a very fun game to play n its passes the time. Would recommend it for everyone. If u love bingo then this is it game
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I was spellbound by this story, read it quickly and savored every sentence. So unusual and enjoyable a read , like no other. I highly recommend this book. You won't go wrong living this gem up and giving it a read.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I had gotten away from Stephen King books for a long time, but the subject of this particular book interested me.  I fell in love all over again....this was one of the best books I have ever read...I couldn't put it down.  It was full of suspense and I just thought the love story angle was the best.  If every book grabbed me like this one did, I would be soooooooooo happy!  Thanks to Mr. King for an outstanding book!!!
B003IEJZUG|5.0|I saw the movie and had to read the book,so glad I did,it gives much more thought to his life and beliefs before the ship sinks. It is so honest and sad,l like the glimpses of PI's life after as well.The art is amazing as well.
B0052OSTOS|5.0|It have helped me go to sleep, which has always been a difficult task.  I sleep better and longer.<br />Thanks(:)
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Can You Escape keeps you thinking and makes you crave more puzzles. Hurry up and create some more rooms.  Fun game.
B0084U0IEG|5.0|The combo of compelling storytelling and exquisite writing is irresistible. One of those rare books that had me so bereft when it was done I started reading it all over again.
B005T9ZTSU|1.0|Version 2 is launch, this is version 1 and cannot login. Do not waste your time to download. Please wait till the new version come.
B00CATSONE|4.0|Teslas story can really make us root for the geeky guy who solves the workings of the world, yet keeps true to his principles.
B007MDB71O|4.0|This was a great flick. I dunno why the box office numbers weren't as high as they should have been but this is a fun movie with all the old Flash Gordon/Star Wars type sci-fi fantasy adventure you could want. More!
B00B4804KS|5.0|Jurassic Park is one of my all time favorite movies.  I just purchased a 3D TV and had to try out this DVD.  First the transfer is wonderful and with 3d it's so clear and the depth is wonderful.  Hard to believe this was not originally filmed in 3D.  I wish they would do the rest in 3D, they may not be everyone's cup of tea but I like the entire trilogy.
B000S46QOM|5.0|In my humble opinion, this is the ultimate Doors recording. I have been in love with the Doors since 'Light My Fire', and, there are very few Doors songs that I don't like. In fact, I cannot think of any right now. I have this on a cassette tape - and, I just purchased another cassette version of this - in case my cassettes become damaged or lost. I purchased the album for one reason:  It is not available on CD. I wish I knew why. I have emailed the Doors website to ask if there is any possibility that it will be remastered on a CD, but never received an answer. I still have a turntable in my Kenwood surround system, but, I dumped all of my vinyl years ago, and, I had a great collection from the 60's and 70's - Jazz, Rock, Pop, Rhythm and Blues, Soul. I wish I had the collection today. There is definitely something special about listening to vinyl, but, I think someone who never experienced the vinyl sound would probably disagree.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book is extremely detailed and has a story no one else would dare to think of this author is truly talented
B00CHSPB8Y|3.0|It is a really good game but there is too much downloading and uses up too much space and other than that it is really fun!
B00471TLZS|5.0|This movie is fantastic in the blu-ray format.  The colors and definition are very vibrant and clear.  This is definitely a good buy.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|This slender game is exciting, makes you so nervous, and very inspiring. I love that you have two options the farm or the road it is hard to collect all eight pages but very fun.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Entwined with you is just what I needed to get out of everyday reality and live in fantasy for a while.  Thank you Sylvia Day.
B0076DELIG|3.0|I read all Connelly's books and found myself having a hard time getting into this one. It just wasn't very interesting in terms of plot and pacing. Bosch is a wonderful character but to know that, you would have to rely on previous books you've read that feature him. Sticking with it, mostly out of loyalty to the character, it finally caught me at around the 70% mark. The over long passages lecturing the reader on jazz greats got old fast because the whole novel was slow therefore the jazz interludes slowed it from that pace. The parts involving his daughter as a marksman seemed like the jazz this time - stuck in there without integration and purpose. I would have rated it 2 stars but Connelly gets a star for being Connelly. Sometimes I wonder, with any popular author, if the pressure of the next book due to the publisher interferes with the process at times of doing one's best work. All the normal conceits of a Bosch novel are here. It's just that I didn't care. Bring on the Lincoln Lawyer and see if that works better next time.
B00CM9JKQM|5.0|I never thought I'd enjoy another Queensryche release after &#34;Promised Land&#34;. I kept buying every release, and was let down every single time. However, this one hit me like a 2 ton heavy thing! Todd LaTorre sounds like Tate in his prime, and the band sounds fresh and inspired. Very well done! Sorry Mr. Tate, but this is the REAL Queensryche!!!!
B004XDYJRU|2.0|I would have given TuneIn Radio Pro a 5 star but no longer because Fast-forward no longer works. After the last update I've been unable to fast forward the Podcasts I'd recorded to a point where I had listened to before. The Fast Forward no longer works. I've tried several different times. Have logged off and restarted but nothing seems to work. I listen to what I've recorded between sales calls so typically I never make it through a show in one sitting. This is a feature I truly enjoyed and with it TuneIn is worth 5 stars but without it use the free version and buy a Podcast player.
B00AVFO41K|1.0|This game is ridiculous.  No rules.  No tutorial.  Good luck getting through level one. Is this fun?  Is this entertaining?<br /><br />I get the basics, match five in a row.  But, it's almost impossible.  I don't get it.  Maybe it's just me.

B004SOR4H6|5.0|Great for managing multiple Twitter accounts. Interface is simple but effective. I highly recommend this app for anyone using Kindle.
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|I've had fun playing this game but it does take a long time to build up your leafmen (armies).  It would go much faster if you spend money (real money) for magical assistance but I am trying to avoid that.  Overall its a good game,  and its free so there's a plus.
1781162646|4.0|Just finished a most excellent beach book. The NYT review is so-so; I thought the book better. King delivers some moving one-liners too, rather much in the hard-boiled tradition. I would call this an etude.<br /><br />My brother Bill thinks he is a Great Writer. There may be some truth to this I think. He is incredibly prolific but I believe his &#34;Gatsby&#34; has yet to be aborned. He's like a rose bush gone wild: madly gushing creativity in need of a pruning shears.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I think this app is amazing.  There are sooooo many sounds you can choose to play and you can layer the sounds any way you want.  I love to play ocean waves with thunder storm and sometimes I add zen music.  Plus it will play as long as you like and as loud as you like and it was free.<br />ahhhh Good night!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Really enjoyed playing this game. It is well designed and colorful. I would recomend to anyone who enjoys brain games and teasers.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|So enjoy using the Bible App.  Love the devotional material that is available for use with the Bible App as well!
B002LC8HF0|5.0|I was lead Sanderson by The Wheel of Time series. I have now read every book and short story he has written and almost all of them are so interesting that I am unable to put the book down until it's finished. I cannot wait for book two of The Way of Kings series.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is like subway surfers, But SOO much better! This game is very fun to play. I am pretty sure all ages will enjoy this.
B00785P2QC|5.0|It took a while to figure this game out but after about an hour I started seeing g to patterns and saw what my city was doing and I love this game now!!! Recommend playing if you city management type games!
0761171703|5.0|The book has some amazing photos and I would recommend it to anyone interested in dance or looking for some artistic inspiration.
B009NQZVKG|4.0|There are several similarities between James Rollins' THE EYE OF GOD and Dan Brown's INFERNO -- most noticeably, both novels are a race against time to save humanity and both are steeped in ancient history with abundant mysteries and exotic locales.<br /><br />I'd suggest however that THE EYE OF GOD succeeds far more than INFERNO for the following reasons: one, the pacing is relentless -- where Brown bogs down with laborious descriptions of artwork, Rollins paints vivid images with sparse prose that allows the story to maintain a full head of steam; two, INFERNO's plot fell apart for me when it became clear that the &#34;bad guy&#34; taunting and leaving clues for the &#34;good guys&#34; was the only way for Brown to move his story forward, which was just dumb, and then he tried to blur the lines between who is really good and bad at the end, and that was even dumber -- Rollins however rips a pretty scary story straight from the headlines, using the threat of NEOs (near earth objects), a comet streaking closer and closer to earth, and high-tech science dealing with dark energy to weave together a scenario that threatens an Armageddon type collision and the end of civilization as we know it; and finally, both these authors are obviously incredibly smart and gifted and do meticulous research, but Dan Brown's writing style always makes me feel like I'm talking to someone who wants me to know how smart he is, whereas (at least in this book) Rollins doesn't let all the research get in the way of the story -- instead it feeds the story and pulls you right along.<br /><br />A couple of minor criticisms: because the threat is from an inanimate object that has no inherently evil intentions, it seemed to me that the author felt he needed a B Story with a real bad guy. So he gives us a North Korean who is up to no good, who gets in the way and tries to kill our heroes ... only he's not doing this because he wants the earth to end, it's just really bad timing for our good guys that with minutes left to save the world this wacko shows up again (and the wacko has no idea what it is the good guys are trying to do, but he's determined to stop them anyway...) and now the good guys have to deal with him AND save the world. To me it was silly. The end of the world due to science was already compelling, the North Korean bad guy weakened the story for me.<br /><br />The second criticism, well ... it's not a big thing, but ask anyone who has traveled internationally to read this book and I think they'd agree that saving the planet in four days when you've got to jet-set all over the world to do it just isn't happening. I get it, this is fiction. We bend the rules. But when the good guys can launch an invasion of Pyongyang and get out in time to travel to Mongolia and they've barely used any of the precious four days they've been given to save the world ... well, it just bugged me, so I mention it here.<br /><br />Overall? It's a fast, fun read, and interspersed with the action there's a number of thought-provoking quotes and some great words of wisdom as well.that with minutes left to save the world this wacko shows up again (and the wacko has no idea what it is the good guys are trying to do, but he's determined to stop them anyway...) and now the good guys have to deal with him AND save the world.

B0013TXA5Y|4.0|I have always enjoyed books about vampires, zombies, witches, werewolves and demons.  This book compiles all of those in one.  It is set in present day New York where a normal everyday kid finds that she can &#34;see&#34; the other world.  Lots of action and monster killing.  Not my favorite, but looking forward to reading the next book.
B003B1X80Y|5.0|This could be considered as one of the best romantic movie based on the novel. Item was delivered way before the deadline, in great packeging and high quality of the disc. I would recommend the movie as well as the seller.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|This Box Set Is 19.99 Its a steal and amazing. It Looks Amazing It Sounds Amazing It Blu-Ray Perfecton Its A Must Have Box Set
B0031RAOW8|5.0|I love this movie and is probably one of the best of Richard Gere. The movie was delivered way on time, excellent condition and package. If you are animal lover, this is one of the best movie and everyone would love it and enjoy it. If you do not have it - I strongly recommend to purchase it. Very good seller services.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|This game offers lots of fun things to do and there are a lot of dinosaurs that you get attached to and its a really great game I suggest it to anyone who loves games that involve taking care of animals and creating a park.
B00BEJOMIW|5.0|The item was delivered on time and the quality is outstannding. Recommend the seller as well as the movie - to my understanding is better then the new version. Just my opinion.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Challenging and a great time killer. I'm loving it! A definite keeper unlike others this one doesn't get old to me. Great job!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I have truly loved all the Downton Abbey series. All of the actors are so good. Can hardly wait until the next one comes out!!!!
B00DMM3WVM|5.0|This game is an amazing game. I would highly recommend this game to anybody who likes shooting zombies and games like temple run. When I first saw this game it had only 9 downloads sand all 5 star reviews and my first thought was these people are just friends of the creator who rated this game to help it start out, but after I got the game I was completely amazed at the graphics and the possibilities that there are. This game is a great game but it can get a lot better
B0059WTMLW|4.0|I love Sudoku and I am pretty bad at it. Most apps don't offer many of the very easy or easy which is needed for a beginner like me. This app has tons of options and is really addictive. YAY PUZZLES
B000VOC90Y|5.0|This backpack has been one of the best purchases I have made recently. Holds all my stuff without becoming bulky, and there tons more room in it.
B000UO338W|3.0|For Ministry's fans, here you will find pretty good music. But I couldn't help to recall early trash metal days when listening to \\"The Last Sucker\\". Go listen Exodus' \\"And Then There Were None\\" and you will know what I am talking about...
0440242401|3.0|Remember Me? has alot of potential, but Sophie Kinsella skates the surface. It's a fun little story and I laughed out loud, yet I never felt any loyalty or real interest in the characters. I enjoyed Lexi, but believe she could have been more interesting if the other characters were further developed. For instance, Rosalie...what is the point of Rosalie? Lexi has a new best friend who is much fancier than Fi, Debs and Carol. What's the story?? Why are they besties? And is Rosalie really friend, or is she foe? Twice we are given the impression that Rosalie isn't crazy about her own husband and I thought \\"Ah ha! Rosalie is getting it on with Eric!!!\\"...no such luck. Rosalie is just there, taking up space on the page. And Amy!!! What's the story with Amy's angst? Amy doesn't care a whit that her big sister can't remember the last 3 years of their life? Apparently not. Was Lexi working to help Amy with her issues? What kind of relationship did they have? If it wasn't obvious to Lexi before, it certianly is now that Amy is in crisis. But again....this was fluff filler and without substance. And Jon.....longingly wishing Lexi would just remember....and then when she is finally free, does he send a giant order of sunflowers to her flat and ask her on a proper date? Nope. He professes such love, but out of sight, out of mind. Only when they accidently meet again does he make any sort of move....resulting in a 48 hour shag. Seriously? Bottom line...it's cute and worth the price on Half.com (75 cents, thank you) or even more at Half Price Books, and I'll keep it on my bookshelf, but I wasn't sad after I turned the last page. I thought, \\"huh, cute book\\" and that was that.
B0079IEPHA|5.0|I love this show and so does my friend who I gave the set to.  Love how they always manage to pull out a win.  Ohhh yeah, and it has Harvey's hair....
1432794426|5.0|I am a longtime fan of Michael, have seen and even met him during those years and I really loved reading this book, which is a collection of almost all aspects of his life, put together in one book! I believe that it can help especially new(er) fans to get a very good knowledge of Michael's life, to help them understand who he was and what moved him. Dr. Moriarty really put her heart in this amazing project, full of appreciation and love!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|A addictive fun gameplay involving everyone's favorite overalled and goggled minions!! This game is a game for all ages, young and old. Despicable minions will make you giggle every time you play Minion Rush! You should definatley download this app before it turns into a 0.99 game... Have fun playing! ;-)
B007Y36K46|5.0|John Carter was roundly panned by the critics.  So what?  This is a great movie!  It is beautifully filmed with a well-woven story line.  The characters are fully fleshed out and believable.  But more than that, the film leaves things to your imagination, which is a delicate balance, and the result is a movie that stays with you, stirring images and ideas long after you think you are past it.  This movie is well worth a watch or 2 or 3 - and definitely worth a sequel!
B0091REZMW|5.0|I love this game because I like to look for things. And that's why I pick to download this game.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|This was a great summer read....Quick read with plot turns and characters you enjoy knowing more about. Another great book by Gillian Flynn.

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|the game is the best game I ever play in my whole life. the game is thebest one l ever
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|An absolutely gorgeous and insightful read. Really, the only negative thing I could say about the novel is that it might be a little too aware of its own intelligence--but even that is worked to an advantage.
B001QJUX24|5.0|The movie was fantastic, but we had to start over once and backtrack another time because the movie froze and we couldn't do anything with it the first time. Other than that it was no problem.
B00913DPW2|5.0|I've recently become somewhat addicted to point-and-click mystery/adventure type games on my Kindle Fire. I have gone through well over a dozen of these games, if not more, and The Haunt is far and away my favorite.<br /><br />This game is very challenging (I definitely had to use the walkthrough several times), but I find that to be an asset. After going through several games with kind of silly storylines, too many hidden object sequences, and excessive hand-holding, The Haunt was refreshingly difficult. You don't always know what you're supposed to do for certain puzzles, or how you are meant to use a particular item in your inventory. There is no \\"journal\\", no \\"obvious hint\\" button, and no dialogue-- you simply investigate a house and its grounds for clues, solving puzzles along the way, ultimately searching for the \\"source\\" of the paranormal activity.<br /><br />The graphics were probably the best that I've seen yet. Sharp and clear, yet detailed. As you go through the game, you are meant to pick up coins, moths and puzzle pieces scattered around or camouflaged in the landscape. Each moth you collect can be used as a hint, but the hints given are riddles in themselves, instead of just pointing where you should go or what you should use. I will admit though, when I found myself near the end of the game with 97/99 puzzle pieces, and was scouring each location over and over for those remaining two, I probably would have appreciated being pointed in the right direction.<br /><br />The general mood of the game is also great-- while you rarely actually encounter a paranormal manifestation, most of the time you just see doors slam suddenly or shadows pass by windows, leaving your imagination to wonder what caused it.<br /><br />I immediately bought The Haunt 2, and heard rumors of a 3rd, so I will be keeping my eye out for it. This game has set the bar quite high, and many of the subsequent Kindle Fire games I've tried have seemed lacking in comparison.
0590402331|5.0|always a favorite of mine.  received on time and in good shape.  thank you for meeting my expectations with a satisfactory product.
B0010SEMP0|5.0|I am hooked on ther series!  I can't stop reading them. I love all of the different relationships that develop.
B003DZX3SA|5.0|was unable to find this video in stores. if favorite of my granddaughter so very happy I could find it on-line.  classic story with great sound track. received on time and in good shape.
B00BCK1A5G|5.0|I loved it and couldn't put it down. What a marvelous twist in this wonderful series. I think Nalini Singh is one of the best writers of today and is grossly under rated. Even her &#34;Angel&#34; series is well written and so easy to read with terrific stories. I can't wait for the next one in either series.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|great game. challenging and fun. hope to see more like this. wish there was more levels and more rooms to make it harder.
B00AIBZJS4|5.0|as wonderful as this video is. . .  it is no comparison  to the excitement of the shows in real life. Great to remember the experience by.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|What a disappointment this book was.  I will not be buying her next book(s) in this series. Ms. Day needs to go back to the basics as to why the first book was terrific and this book was terrible.
B00BSBUZT6|5.0|The title says it all. This is a story of the group Eagles, presented in a documentary style. Who, where and how it all started.  Technically, the quality of this package - picture and sound-wise - is the best the format can offer. The vintage video footage looks really old. And they add weight to the story. And the more recent video footage looks as if they were shot yesterday. The sound - presented in 2 lossless formats (stereo and surround) - is both full and dynamic.<br />Being an Eagles fan, this package - presented in 3 Blu-ray discs - is a real treat. And should be in every fan's collection.
B002ZG98Z0|5.0|Love this movie and I had been searching sometime for the DVD. For a while there was none available. Was glad I added it to my wish list because I received an email when it was back in stock. Thanks Amazon. Shipped fast and was able to get the other movie for a deal. If you are a diva who loved the shoe you will love the movie.
B00006LJ6X|4.0|Classic Chicago CD.  This timeless CD of some of their major hits will not disappoint!!  Clear and crisp sounds and I absolutely loved it.
B0067QPVD2|5.0|Gave it five stars for the great value of this dvd. I rarely buy blu-ray unless it is for a great movie. I love this dvd, it was a great price for the dvd and blu-ray disc. I have never used Ultraviolet so i can't review that feature. I love the remake and the original movie, so this was a great buy for both versions of the movie. Would recommend this product to any horror or thriller movie buff:)
B008MPQ0R2|5.0|This movie shows the delicate balance between loyalty, loneliness and passion. Handled with supreme elegance  and grace by Maggie Cheung and Tony Leung Chiu Wai, two wonderful actors and directed by a the deft hand of Kar Wai Wong.  Visually beautiful, artfully performed and directed.
B0011UBDTK|5.0|This shoe is for all fashion lovers. Everyone can relate to a characters sense of style and personality traits. Not to mention the stories of love, heartbreak, and just the all around crap we deal with as women. Spent a few days on my vacation just watching the entire show. Must need time to chill, laugh, cry, and reflect on things that need to change in my life for the better.
B00CL68NOG|5.0|I love great character combinations and hysterical story line.  Watched this on a plane ride and had to keep my laughter under control.

B0099Y2MYK|5.0|My huband and I have enjoyed every minute of this wonderful series and are looking forward to Season 4, although we were upset at the ending of Season 3.  But we're sure the story will continue with great actors to portray the characters.  Maggie Smith is a treasure indeed.
B009CF3P7E|5.0|The latest crew of the starship Enterprise are true to the original cast in their own way.  The story, the music, the metaphors, and the jokes would most likely make Gene Roddenberry proud.
B00D6BU8GG|4.0|If you like Bruce Willis or if you like Die Hard movies then you'll like this. The &#34;son&#34; was a good addition. I'd watch it again.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My son's love this game.  It is one of their favorite games. They can play this game all day long.
0061673730|5.0|Enjoyed this book in the 70's. Loved giving it to my grandchildren. Would love you to send me another copy. Thank you, Mary Cromwell
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|The game gives the opportunity to buy or bread new dragons. It's valueery easy to play and for all ages. They have different dragons available during special times. The dragons are really cute too.
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|I'm delighted with the sea of knowledge in this easy to read and straightforward book. Anyone sufficiently open-minded and curious about metaphysics and self awareness will enjoy The Four Agreements. Love it!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is realistic, and I enjoy playing it a lot. My Horse is truly a great app for everyone and is a great app at any time.
B000ZK4466|5.0|This is one of my favorite Mars Volta albums! Admittedly they lost me for a while after Frances da Mute. But now they have my full attention again. This album is upbeat and entertaining. The  of electronics and traditional instruments keeps the music interesting. I love to listen
B003O86FMW|5.0|This in my opinion is the best book of the hunger games. Suzanne Collins does a fantastic job of keeping it very unexpected. If you read it you will be very surprised.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Absolutely loved this book!!! Sylvia Day did an awesome job! Can't wait until the next one comes out! Please don't make us wait that long!!!!!
B005OT2YVA|5.0|If you like transformers watch this movie. Even though Megan fox isn't in this movie it is still a great movie.
B0024F08RO|5.0|This is one of my favorite shows and I love how they wrapped it up.  Season 3 is hard to swallow but this definitely got me hooked to the end.
B007IGG0IA|4.0|Florence has a beautiful voice that sounds flawless throughout this whole unplugged track. I thought this included video too but it didn't but her voice makes up for it.
B0034G4P26|5.0|My 3 year old loves this movie.  He has watched 10 times at least.  It has some scenes that are a bit rough and scary for him but that makes him want to watch over and over to beat his fear.  The Pirates are not all bad and end up doing good.  I do worry a bit when he quotes the Pirate Captain and says &#34;Let's go plundering&#34; in public.  Fun movie.  The extras are not that extra though.  Do not buy for those.
034580709X|4.0|Long before Stieg Larsson, and about the same time as Henning Mankell started publishing his \\"Wallander\\" novels (1997), Jo Nesbo, economist, Rock star, songwriter, published his first \\"Harry Hole\\" novel.<br /><br />It was a major hit in the Netherlands and all of Europe.<br /><br />It led to Nesbo becoming one of the world's leading crime writers.<br /><br />It was never translated into English or published in America, even while a number of other Nesbo noirs were (Thanks, let's be honest, to the Larsson success).<br /><br />And it took almost a decade and a half for this tale of a Norwegian cop (o.k. a Norwegian cop with a wee drinking problem) \\"observing\\" a murder in Sydney to, finally, appear.<br /><br />But, here it is.<br /><br />And, now we know that, while Larsson was a bit of a parvenu, Nesbo is the real deal.<br /><br />The Hole books (Look, let's stop this right now! \\"Hole\\" is a common Norwegian name... and it's pronounced HOO-leh! So STOP THE TITTERING!) are masterpieces of noir and deserve to be at the top of ANY reader's list.<br /><br />Especially in Don Bartlett's brilliant translations!<br /><br />Oh, one more thing. \\"The Bat\\" is NOT a literal translation of the original Norse title and, even though it has the same name as a minor classic in the mystery field, was probably thought the lesser of two evils anent using the original title... \\"The Batman\\"
0070511136|5.0|Talk about turning sales on its head.  It used to only be &#34;ABC - Always Be Closing&#34;, but now Rackham has turned that on its side.  The best part is that it is actually based on sound research.  Very good reading. Take the challenge and apply some of its principles.  You will sell more
B004SIIBGU|1.0|I would rather these people didn't write software than putting out a half written app with fundamental features missing!  Does anybody review this stuff before it goes out?!?!? Why would they omit &quot;Contact Seller&quot;?!?!<br /><br />STUPID!<br /><br />ONE STAR!
B001BKVWYG|5.0|All the music is great to listen to.  Some are more enjoyable than others.  The pocket wine guide is a good reference point.
B005DF2QMC|4.0|Bought this to digitize about 100 old cassette tapes I had -- very basic process, but it works great and I have been very pleased with the quality of the finished product (the digital recording).  I think it sounds better than the original!  And, considering I was about to throw away all of my old tapes and lose all of the valuable stuff on them (like old air checks from my radio days and interviews with my family) ... I'm very thankful I got this. Price was very reasonable too.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game was fun for the whole family.  Definitely a good family game.<br />Would recommend to others especially families.  Grade B plus.
B00498YZFK|5.0|This movie was great! It showed that Jennifer Lawrence can play any type of role. The story line on this movie was great. I wouldn't doubt for a second that things like this movie happen in reality!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|the game is adorable. I like the animation and the sound effects. my only problem is the fact that you have to pay to play ; if it says free then it is free. I hate that. so many developers do that now. why can't you just tell the truth: if the game is good enough people will pay without being fooled : (
B0064X7FVE|2.0|its ok but they need too up date this app I did not know there was a new up date. they need too let us know when there's a up date
B0083Z614S|5.0|It was awesome and I loved it.:) that is the reason I put 5 stars loved it loved it yay.
B004SCN2F6|5.0|I remembered playing a similar game years ago and checked for a version for Kindle. Found this one and am very pleased with it. The game has performed flawlessly. There is an abundance of choices and opportunities. This isn't a mindless time sink, unless you just want to kill off captain and crew. In that case, by all means give no thought to the consequences of your choices. Great, no, Excellent game. Have fun!
B004SOR4H6|4.0|No problems. I log in and check all the things that I am following and log out for the day.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|This is a great game with the sealed play mode you can build your own deck hours of fun and 10 bucks for the full version? Not bad
B00AB2NYNC|5.0|Obviously, since you're looking at this collection of Mumford's, soon to be classics, you do not need me to tell you that this is an awesome album. For the price, this package (Road to Red Rocks DVD, Live at Red Rocks audio, and, of course, Babel) cannot be beaten. All items included are of quality!
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|A fun game to play but it can be slightly expensive if you want to level up quickly. Patience is needed for parts of the game to be completed but overall it is a fun game to play.
B00AQL8VU4|5.0|A nice streamlined way to shop Amazon and manage your account on a tablet.<br /><br />I have it installed on my Acer Iconia Tab A110.  Amazon Mobile makes it even easier to part with your money.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|The continuation of the Crossfire, I found that this installment leaving a lot of questions unanswered but the animal attraction was still going strong.<br /><br />I can't wait to see if there will be a wedding and who's?
B0011Z51QG|5.0|One off the greatest musicians off our time! His intelligence and grace comes through his fingertips like lightening while the words take you someplace else :-)
B0054JZC6E|5.0|i love this game. it is great for all ages. it never gets boring because you have so many games to choose. that is why i like it
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This calc fits perfectly on my kindle fire.it works just as great as it looks! Handy to have while shopping or doing the check register! I highly recommend of you haven't jumped on this already...I got as a free app of the day :-)
B008JGSM6G|5.0|'Thoroughly enjoy the bright colors and mental gymnastics necessary to complete the higher levels.  They start out fairly simply, but with each new level become more and more of a challenge... as any good brain-teaser would.<br /><br />I'm sure this will help to keep minds active and in good shape.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|This is one of my favorite comedies on tv.  Just luv it.  It continues to entertain & make me laugh.
B00AEUPOVQ|5.0|I like the movie very much. It has some funny parts as does the book.  Acting is pretty good - especially the father.
B00BSBU4EC|4.0|I liked this one, it  would be good for those with little kids.  Or those who are kids at heart.  I will watch it again I'm sure. &#60;3
B00AVFO41K|5.0|I'm confused by the many negative reviews complaining about how hard this game is. I've played a few games like this, and they are ALL hard.<br /><br />Basic rules: move a colored ball from one place on the board to another, as long as there is an open path of horizontal and vertical moves to get from point A to point B. If that results in 5 in a row or more, then the matching balls will all disappear. Otherwise, a handful of new ones will appear. There are some special balls that will clear additional balls in a line or area, and these can trigger others, generating large chain reactions. There are also rainbow balls that can match anything.<br /><br />There are three difficulty levels that control how many new balls appear for each non-match (3-5 for easy/normal/hard). You will NOT get massive scores in this game. 1000 points is a good score on normal. Play this game when you want to kill a few minutes.
B00BGIBVP8|3.0|This was predictable but, very funny and easy to follow.  It is worth watch if you are looking for something lighthearted but, it is not amazing.  Leslie Mann and Paul Rudd are very funny but, both have done better.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Wool is set in a post-apocalyptic world. A society of survivors has been living in autarky in a 100-something-story underground silo, for countless generations. On the top floor is a wall-wide screen that shows the output of an outside camera, that is, pictures of the desolate landscape surrounding the silo, with the ruins of a city in the background. The camera's lens gets dirty with time though, so the capital punishment consists of getting put into a sort of spacesuit and dispatched to the outside world, in order to clean the lens with a bundle of wool. This means certain death, as the corrosive atmosphere pierces the suit in a matter of minutes. We begin the story by following the fate of Sheriff Holston who, in the first few pages, expresses his desire to \\"go outside\\", a thought which is automatically liable to capital punishment in this society.<br /><br />Wool is divided into five parts. Parts 1 and 2 each focus on a different couple of characters. From part 3 onward, the continuity is more obvious and we stop jumping to different main protagonists. Still, all five parts build a single cohesive story. And what a grim story it is! Even compared to other post-apocalyptic science-fiction, many moments are strikingly depressing. Perhaps this stems from Hugh Howey's talent for creating likeable characters and his tendency for making them go through hell.<br /><br />In addition to strong characters, Wool has many qualities. The story is strong. The society that Howey describes is peculiar but he makes it completely alive and believable. Also, while the conclusion is obviously written with the possibility of a sequel in mind, it still completes the story in a satisfying way, meaning the book is perfectly self-sufficient. And the pacing in the first half of the book is absolutely perfect.<br /><br />Which naturally means that it is less than perfect in the second half, where the story drags on more than one occasion. This second half's main characters are also less striking. They aren't weak by any stretch of the imagination, but I didn't find it as obvious to care about them. In that part, I sometimes wished the book would focus on one of the many colourful supporting characters. I was also annoyed by a scientific blunder related to the way the human body works (I won't be more specific to avoid spoiling an important part of the plot) and by some aspects of the silo that are difficult to comprehend. For example, the silo seems to have no problem with supplying power to its various facilities, yet there isn't a single elevator to help its population navigate the more than 100 levels. Not even for emergencies, meaning officials have to embark on a trip lasting several days if they want to reach the bottom from the top (or the other way around).<br /><br />Overall, though, this is a well-written, interesting story, whose author deserves most of its success. It has flaws, but they are relatively minor when compared to its brilliant qualities. I recommend it to anyone interested in science fiction, who isn't bothered by a story that puts more emphasis on its characters than on the science. It's refreshing to see a publishing sensation live up to most if its hype, for once.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|I loved this.  It would be a good one for parents w/ small kids.  I will watch this one again.
B0061PEAUY|4.0|Fast pace moving novel easy morning reading with a good cup of coffee, I enjoy on the Brennan novels so far
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|This is a good movie for the whole family.  Something for everyone (except maybe, teenagers).  I am looking forward to the second one.  Would watch again for sure.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This was a magical book---well written and very hard to put down.  This is the third book that I have read by this author, and once again, it kept my rapt attention, thirsty for more.
B006BAEQB2|4.0|I was reluctant to read this one because I wasn't overly interested in Anne Neville but I love Philippa Gregory and I'm so glad I read this one. I couldn't put it down.<br /><br />Its an interesting perspective on the story. Told from the viewpoint of Anne Neville who I had long considered to be a minor fringe player in Cousin's War books.<br /><br />Philippa makes you reconsider the way you've previously felt about some of the earlier characters she has written about. You may just find yourself changing allegiances.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Its like the old night time soaps like Dynasty and knots landing.  I love the stories based back in the time of horse and carriages and seasons.
B00CTKHXFO|5.0|you sneak around in cardboard boxes and shoot guns in the head with guns!<br /><br />how fun is that!<br /><br />i love this game, it has many parts, the graphics are lousy in the first one, but become better (i think they had time to improve them) as you reach part 4.<br /><br />a ripoff series from hitman agent 47, but a good try.<br /><br />buy it!
B00AVFO41K|2.0|Instructions are generally needed in a new game. If instructions for the very least tutorial method are not included it makes the game much harder to play and much less fun.
074401493X|1.0|it's not like the game is not easy enough!<br />you need to make a guide for almost 30 bucks to help you through it?<br />i don't understand the logic!<br />plus the cover is just black with words; you would think you could at least buy it as a collector item, but with a lazy cover like that, it is just deadweight.
B00BHJ0MY2|5.0|Exceeded my expectations.  Having seen Rokia Traore perform live in Norwich, I knew I liked her music.  Can't stop playing it!
161655164X|1.0|it has the same amount of art as a weekly marvel comic for 2 bucks<br />but this is 10 times the price<br />plus it is only pictures that you ALREADY SEE IN THE GAME<br />and no new plot or story or anything<br />rip-off much????<br />buyer beware!
B005URRCUY|5.0|Love every song on the album.<br />The Black Keys are my new favorite band.<br />Now I'm looking to get they're older cd's.
030789701X|5.0|Excellent. This game guide has it all. All Quests, Items, Bestiary - all elements are included and easy to find within the guide.
B00CF34B2I|4.0|This is a great app. I love being able to play magic on my kindle. My only complaint is that there is a limited amount of single player battles.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|As riveting as the previous two. Can`t wait for season 4 to find out how they will handle the recent circumstances that have come about.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I really don't know how I finished this book.  Not very much substance, I enjoy the characters, but they need more depth.  The story really has no where else to go at this point, I was hoping for more.
B0063IH60K|5.0|It is Easy and enjoyable to play and now I can have it when I travel or not near my computer.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|Being familiar with the ways and whims of law firms, I thoroughly enjoyed the intricate plots (although most unrealistic)....obviously, there is strife and rancor within any enterprise such as an ego-driven law practice.  Acting superb.
B00C7JGDBW|5.0|I love the movie however, I did think it would be one I could watch with the grandkids, and now will rethink this.  The movie has some very scary parts so I have decided to hold off showing this to my young ones.
B0041KKYDI|4.0|This movie was based on a real life situation, and James Franco show us his range in this. A well produced movie that shows the trials & tribulations one faces and how they overcome it!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|This is a amazingly good book Gideon and Eva have come so far and still have obstacles in their way. So happy Sylvia day is writing more crossfire, I am so not over this couple's story
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is such a cute game. Fun to just sit and relax and play with every little girls dream horse minus cleaning up after it.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|A very well-written book, easy to understand for people who are not into the religious or medical life.  What I liked the most was the way in which Dr. Alexander depicts his life before and after this experience, leading me to believe that there was a real experiene, independently from his beliefs.  I was also surprised by the doctor's desire to tell his story and hopefully produce a change.
B00BCX2F66|4.0|Then htc one is a very good looking phone, this just makes it look better. Plus it acts as a stand to watch videos.
B00991TCOG|5.0|Absolutely love Lindsey Stirling. Her music is touching and powerful. the CD came in perfect condition. I would order it again in a heart beat.
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|I really enjoyed how the quirkiness of the characters were revealed in this movie...nice and slow which I felt drew me into the story. The chemistry between the characters was fun to watch and gave me several laugh out loud moments during the show.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Its pretty cool. It just needs more rooms but i really enjoyed th&eacute; game. It gives you something to do
B007FEFLTO|5.0|This was an amazing book! The story continues to follow the lives of families from the previous book Fall of Giants during the Second World War. You can actually feel the impact that the rise of Hitler and rise of communism has on the characters. It is a great read and if you like a story with characters that come alive, mixed  with history, you will enjoy this book. I can't wait for the third in the trilogy.
B00007BH5C|4.0|For those who likes the soundtrack of the Lord of the Rings, we can't miss the Two Towers. Not so fantastic as the Return of the King, but also outstanding!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game was a lot of fun.  Makes you use your brain! Can't wait for more of these floors to come in the future.
B000KIPT30|5.0|I had bought one of these for my hard-of-hearing mother in law, and decided that one would be useful in my own bedroom to permit use of headphones to watch TV late at night without disturbing my wife.
B00A6CT012|5.0|Although you can get a lot of these tips scouring the internet it sure is helpful to have them all in one place!!
B0042UE0RS|5.0|Lennon had a masterful talent for writing lyrics that described a generation. My generation is missing out on true artists work because &#34;music&#34; is so digitized and perfect that it resembles a computer more than a human.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|So on kindle fire hd this game take FOREVER to load, and then you can't even play it. It gets stuck on the loading screen, so you have to either restart it or make it sleep and wake it up and take the special offer. If you swipe the lock it will just go back to the loading screen. Very disappointed. Please fix!!!
B009O06XC6|3.0|Promised a 3-pack, including the original water-tight door, but there were only the underwater and sound doors included.  They are fine, but I was misled.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Be careful this game is addicting! Keep wanting to play. Some are simple and some a little hard. Good for brain stimulation.
B0020BUWX2|4.0|Couldn't put it down. Not quite The Fault in Our Stars, but good in its own way. Would recommend for sure.
B001HN6922|5.0|I bought this for my nephew and he is absolutely thrilled with it! He has fallen in love with the movie and all the toys! I would recommend it to a friend.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Great game ! Can't wait for another ! Very challenging ! Reminded me of Myst which has been mentioned by others. Too few games in this genre !
B00COGZ8FU|3.0|After having read the book, I was fairly disappointed. The movie was very disappointing. I think there needed to be a better screen play written. The book was great. I don't think the audience really got to know Jack Reacher
B0089AD8IO|4.0|this is not the fold out set that looks like the tardis this is your standard dvd case but it contains the same features and is extremely reccomended for people who are interested in becoming a doctor who addict
B00C2C637I|5.0|Ray Bradbury took a literary side road twice in his writing career and, in both instances, was highly successful. \\"Dandelion Wine\\" will always be one of the most fluent and reminiscent books ever to be published while \\"...Wicked..\\" is one of its most fearfully provocative.<br /><br />Evil drifts into a small hamlet on a threatening and windswept night to challenge the fears, unmet aims and the disappointing realities of its residents. The symbolic characters of Dark, Nightshade and Will battle in the murkiness that lies between the  contrasting impulses of narcissism and altruism, between fears and hopes, and between illusions and realities.<br /><br />In a manner quite unlike the movie of the same name, the issue is finalized on the country meadow from which the story originated.  Learning, understanding and faithfulness are gathered as the story's main characters rejoice and then continue along on life's journey....
B000NTPDSW|5.0|this is the ultimate godfather collection if you are fan of these films or have never seen them i highly suggest buying this set it is worth every penny
B004SRWW0C|2.0|didn't work for me
B003EV6DBW|5.0|this set comes with most everything a whovian could want the packaging can be a bit problematic but besides that i would reccomend the set for any fan of the matt smith era
B0093X80VQ|5.0|This is a great book and if you have read caharlie and the chocolate factory than this is the book for you
B009ZXT4BY|2.0|this app when I first opened it the app wasn't responding to my kindle so in my head I said to myself I'm not opening this app anymore because it lagged my kindle 4 times and it took over 2 hours to get back in and create a review so sorry candy Rufus games I'm going to uninstall it.
B00CP2Z5TC|4.0|Great album. Shows great progress in the band. I can't wait for there next project. I am hoping they tour near here soon
B004DLPXAO|5.0|It works like a charm on my android device.  There are lots of great free books.  I can use it to download books from the local public library.  The app was free.  What's not to love?!?
0812550706|5.0|I have bittersweet feelings knowing that this book made its way into my backpack - but was never opened - almost 15 years ago. Sad that I didn't read it then, as a young and impressionable middle schooler. At the same time, happy that I had saved it all this time and read it as a young adult.
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|I had gotten behind in the episodes so I caught up on Sunday.<br /><br />The anticipation of what happens next made me purchase the next two episodes.<br /><br />I can't wait to finish out Season 1.
159463176X|2.0|It was huge anticipation I awaited And THe Mountains Echoed. I loved his other 2 works, really pieces of art. This book is no where near the other novels. The first chapter holds your attention, is interesting and similar to the style we've all loved. But after, it goes down hill. Quickly. I read over 100 books per year but this was the most confusing book I've read in several years. Too many characters, too much time issues (past, present, forwards) and overall is just hard to follow. While his other novels get into great character development and you fall in love with them all, this is the opposite. Every other chapter introduces someone new and by the middle, it becomes fuzzy who and how they are all intertwined. The Kite Runner remains one of my all time favorites but this is very different and very confusing. Buyer beware!
B00CKOYVG8|2.0|Purchased game not knowing it was for playing with friends on facebook. I'm not into the social networking thing at this time.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|A great autobiography, humble in his words and a true American hero along with all who served with him. I'm sure there are many who wish they could come close to filling his shoes. I was shocked to hear of his murder. My heart goes out to his wife and children.
B000002B5L|5.0|I will always love the fugees, they were so unique, their style, the way the mixed other tracks with it and even oldie songs laced through....I have yet to find a replacement for them, they were the beginning and so far they are the end...
B00BHNQ5XK|5.0|This movie was as good as expected. I loved it and it totally scared the crap out of me. Lol. I would so recommend this to others that like scary horror movies.
1476734941|5.0|HAVEN'T APPLIED THE PURPOSE OF THIS BOOK BUT IT WAS NEW AND I WILL DELVE INTO IT WHEN MY MIND IS RIGHT
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|This movie I recommend for kids it kept my kids attention which is very unusual. My kids usually won't sit still for a movie that long. But this had awesome graphics and was a great choice for my kids.
1878424505|5.0|THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE BOOKS AND SINCE I LOANED MY ORIGINAL AND IT WAS NOT RETURNED I WAS PLEASED TO RECEIVE THIS ONE IN SUCH GOOD SHAPE.....LIKE NEW
B007TXN4TK|5.0|I have been waiting for a piano game and here it is. It is a very fun way to practice playing the piano withought a harsh instructor
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Addictive. Once I saw the first segment I kept on for the entire 4 seasons. Wonderful actors, great production values. I did find one or two of the characters (Twister and Queenie) a bit too quaint and somewhat irritating. I call it a s--urprise because I have been familiar with British serials only through PBS programming. Never even heard of this series.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a fun game to play.. my kids love it. Everyone in the house lobes it. It's great so much fun
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It is a fun game! And I really enjoy playing it! It is good for even younger kids or adults!
B001TCHDPS|5.0|Rodriguez is a great singer & writer.  It's too bad we had to wait so long for him to be rediscovered.  Dylan he isn't & by that I mean he's better as a singer & song writer.
0062064304|5.0|Really a great, in depth concept art book. Unlike other concept art books I've bought, which contain mostly sketches of already finalized designs, The D9 art book has TONS of crazy awesome concepts for the prawns and exosuit, etc. Really a gem of an art book, especially for scifi lovers.
B00BQ1D7X4|5.0|AIC has never received the recognition that they deserve.  They have survived the untimely death of Layne Staley to live on.  Great musicians writing & singing great songs.  You don't last as long as they have without being good.
B00AVFO41K|2.0|The only reason I gave this two stars is that the graphics are OK and it works. If you are the kind of person that likes to spend lots of time on a game that you can never win with absolutely no reward other than a higher score this might be the game for you. But if you are looking for entertainment, this most likely isn't the game for you. I think this game would only be addictive to someone with OCD.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|Rodriguez is a great singer & writer.  It's too bad we had to wait so long for him to be rediscovered.  Dylan he isn't & by that I mean he's better as a singer & song writer.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|I worked on Iron Man 3, but this movie is just WAY more entertaining. Love it! I would watch it over & over (even good on my iPhone)
B00AVFO41K|5.0|ORIGINAL REVIEW TITLE: \\"The odds are well stacked against you... and that is NO FUN! (Update: Dev response in comments!)\\" (was 2 stars)<br /><br />NEW REVIEW UPDATE IS HERE (original review is below it): Wow! The developer did a MAJOR update to this game and it's extremely playable now!<br /><br />Here is what he/she/they posted in the comments to this review:<br /><br />\\"Hi Thom :<br />I just update a new version and finish Amazon's review .<br />And I do these changes as below<br />====<br />1. Make game more easy<br />2. Add Mute Sound function<br />3. Remove extra permission<br />4. Add How to Play Pages<br />5. Add cross platform global rank service (Beta)<br />======<br />Please update it to try .<br />If you have any suggestion . Just post here .<br /><br />Thank you\\"<br /><br />I DO understand that the developer's first language is NOT English, and I am okay with that. The help pages are in need of an overhaul BUT I am glad that they are now there! Therefore, I am offering TO the developer, if he would like, I would offer a good English translation. NO strings. I'd just like to do it for them because, well, they really are working hard on this game to make it better.<br /><br />I also appreciate that the pace of the game was slowed down somewhat. It's hard to explain in detail because I am not 100% on exactly what they changed internally in the code, BUT the game definitely \\"feels\\" different now and is quite fun to play!<br /><br />They cleaned up the permissions? EXCELLENT!<br /><br />Mute sound from within the game? NICE and convenient!<br /><br />The new (beta) global rank service may be fun for some. I personally am not into that sort of thing BUT I can't knock it because as long as it doesn't get hacked and it stays fair, it will probably be fun for many people to compare themselves to.<br /><br />Due to the hard work the developers put into this game so far, I have to say that I am TOTALLY won over and thus I can only respond by doing the right thing and raise my review to FIVE well deserved stars (up fro only TWO)! My PROPS to the developer and I look forward to future updates and also trying other games that you create!<br /><br />THANK YOU!<br /><br />ORIGINAL UNEDITED REVIEW IS BELOW:<br /><br />Basically the idea is to line up five \\"balls\\" of one color or style in a row. Click one and you can then move it anywhere you want as long as nothing is obstructing it. However, every move you make causes more balls to pop up on the board randomly-- and that is the game's fatal flaw: the sheer amount of randomness and the plethora of new balls that get added to the board for every single move that you make. But more on that later... there is more to describe. As the new balls pop up every move, now and then \\"special ones\\" will randomly appear-- examples are bombs, \\"any color\\" balls and directional pieces (that will basically allow you to move/destroy pieces in ways you normally can't). As for bombs, if you can line up two bombs at either end of a row then it will cause an explosion, taking a bunch of pieces with it.<br /><br />And then I just threw up my hands. The board just keeps filling up with random pieces faster than you can clear them no matter what you do. There's just no way to get ahead. Beyond that, I became so bored that I just  couldn't continue. I had this game back on my Palm Pilot years ago and I didn't play it then either for the same reasons.<br /><br />In short, the fatal flaw of this game is the sheer randomness and unfair amount of new pieces that constantly pop up. It takes away the actual skill factor because there's no way to beat this game that I could find; it is solely up to chance, each and every move you make being responded to with pure randomness by the game. Because of that there's actually no real amount of skill involved because it gets negated instantly.<br /><br />Therefore, it's just an exercise in frustration and for that reason I cannot recommend it. Instead of you playing the game with any hope of logical rewards you're just playing a random board of chance.<br /><br />Also, the lack of in-game instructions just show me that the developer barely cares about the game. It feels unfinished, it looks unfinished and without any instructions or anything it isn't actually finished. If the developer doesn't care about their game then why should I? Did they even play test it? If they did then how could they have missed the part about it being completely not fun (and not fair)? Even the description of the game here on Amazon is tossed together and isn't even proof read. Well, the game reflects that lack of attention to detail as well.<br /><br />Don't even bother with this even as the free app of the day. It just isn't worth it.<br /><br />1 star is all that I could come up with for this mess, I'm sorry.<br /><br />**********<br /><br />(UPDATE: I have now raised the rating to two stars because the developer has commented below this review in my comments. I believe the developer is sincere and therefore I gave him a star for showing up and I promise that I will keep an eye on things and will raise the rating accordingly if he follows through on what he says he's going to do.)<br /><br />(UPDATE 2: As you can see if you read this whole thing... I have raised the review to 5 stars and explained why, above.)me with any hope of logical rewards you're just playing a random board of chance.<br /><br />Also, the lack of in-game instructions just show me that the developer barely cares about the game.

B000FCKGPC|5.0|I love all of the characters in these stories mostly because they're so brought to life. I'll admit that it's getting to the point where I'm liking the show more and more, but I see the books as a sort of &#34;in-their-shoes&#34; perspective of the characters I've come to grow so fond of. I'd recommend reading this if you want to get into the heads of some of your (least) favorite characters!
0062127241|5.0|I just finished Pete Townshend's amazing autobiography, \\"Who Am I,\\" and there is so much information, so much insight into how a great artist's mind works, that I didn't quite know how to start my review.<br /><br />So I put on one of my favorite Who songs, \\"Eminence Front.\\" It starts out with a synthesized drumbeat, very simple. Then sequenced synthesizers come in and set up a more frenetic rhythm. Then another synth joins the first. It's the kind of thing that shouldn't work, but it does because it was so meticulously done. An electric piano appears, adding some melody, there are little guitar accents tossed in for good measure, then BANG, in come the drums and the main riff. Add an ace guitar solo, then--after two minutes--Pete Townshend comes in singing.<br /><br />This piece serves as a perfect metaphor for Pete Townshend's adult life. Repeatedly, he starts with a kernel of an idea, adds to it layer by layer until it becomes something transcendent.<br /><br />The Who are rock legends, with the combination of Roger Daltrey's powerhouse vocals singing Pete Townshend's lyrics. They had several pop/rock hits in the 1960's. Then Townshend had the idea to do a rock opera. There was the kernel. The story of the deaf, dumb, and blind pinball wizard grew in his imagination. He carefully wrote the songs, orchestrated the arrangements, and made sure his idea was complete.<br /><br />That became \\"Tommy.\\" Amazing songs: \\"Pinball Wizard,\\" \\"We're Not Gonna Take It,\\" the list goes on. It became an instant classic.<br /><br />A few years later, legendary director Ken Russell wanted to make a movie of \\"Tommy.\\" Once again, Pete Townshend went to work. He threw himself into writing more orchestrations for the film, working with Russell and the producers, helping with the cast, making sure it was complete.<br /><br />That became the film, \\"Tommy,\\" a cult classic.<br /><br />Later, Pete Townshend threw himself into bringing \\"Tommy\\" to the stage. Tons more work. Voila. A Tony-winningmusical.<br /><br />I single out \\"Tommy,\\" because it was a huge project for Pete Townshend at every step. He spent hours in his home studios, teaching himself piano, programming synthesizers, writing new orchestrations.<br /><br />During the course of the labor-intensive \\"Tommy\\" projects--which spanned decades--Townshend managed to write songs for several Who albums (including another themed project, \\"Quadrophenia,\\" which also became a film and musical). He toured relentlessly, juggled marriage and fatherhood, sobriety and abuse, maintained his spirituality, wrote and developed solo projects, worked as an editor for a major London publisher, started various businesses, wrangled with lawyers and managers, developed new themed projects, worked with charities, and he was always downstairs in his studio, experimenting.<br /><br />Pete Townshend makes your typical workaholic look like a slacker. I was utterly amazed at how many different projects the man could handle at the same time, and do them all remarkably well.<br /><br />\\"Who I Am\\" isn't just about work. Townshend takes us inside his long marriage to Karen, and his joy in raising three children. We feel his heartbreak as his marriage falls apart, and he tries and fails to find true love again (ultimately, he does). He takes us on the road with The Who, through triumphs and bombs.<br /><br />During his life, he lost some close friends. For years, Townshend watched Who drummer Keith Moon spiral deep into alcoholism; he was saddened but not surprised when he got the call that Moon had died. Townshend was crushed when bassist John Entwistle died while the band was on tour.<br /><br />It was just Townshend and Roger Daltrey left from the original who. Pete Townshend speaks lovingly of Daltrey. They are like brothers who are close, but still have the odd spat.<br /><br />Through all of the frenetic work, all of the projects, the songs, the tours, the musical experimentation, the one thing missing from Townshend's lifewas true happiness. He was wealthy and famous, with a healthy family, but still he was driven to do more and more.<br /><br />\\"Who Am I\\" was written by an older, contented, happy Pete Townshend. He is, as he puts it, \\"near three score and ten\\" years old, and he wears it well. He and his beloved make music, both alone and together, just for the sheer joy of it. Townshend is still busy with The Who and other projects, especially his charity work on behalf of cancer research, abused children, and many other worthy causes.<br /><br />Over the years, he's learned to be an epic songwriter, a tremendous musician, an excellent singer; he's learned to be a businessman, a philanthropist, even a sailor.<br /><br />Today, after all these years, the payoff is this: Pete Townshend has finally learned how to be Pete Townshend. Is that enough for him?<br /><br />You better, you better, you bet.<br /><br />Highly Recommended<br /><br />(I received a review copy of this book from the publisher via NetGalley)
B00BRR66SA|5.0|Awesome lyrics, awesome beats, awesome music, awesome arragements, awesome BRVs.  AWESOME CD!!<br />This has to be JT's best cd ever!
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|so whatever, 2 &#34;crazy&#34; people who more realistically border on zoe deshanel-esque-contained &#34;quirky&#34; become &#34;friends&#34; through their &#34;disfunctions&#34;, are ultimately &#34;sane&#34; enough to realize what's really going on and how to mutually orchestrate a love connection... obviously within 5 minutes of meeting (duh! i mean if THAT'S not &#34;crazy' then what is?!). i'm sure legitimately medicated people would find this easy arrangement problematic, and potentially there is some legitimate concern about romanticizing mental illness as if it is a temporary condition that &#34;true love&#34; (or a little bit of hard work and bodily discipline!) can't solve on its own (so long as your are pretty and aren't fat).  Ultimately this is another fairy tale about two regular but abnormally good-looking people who go completely bananas after experiencing everday events and then find solice in one another's fake-crazy and good lookingness. please.
B003THHIEM|5.0|I enjoy the humor in these episodes. The characters blend well together, the stories are well thought out and the situations are believable. I usually figure out who did it early in mysteries. These take a bit longer for me and I like that.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|This game pack is just OK. After all it is free!  There are plenty of ads (as with most free games). So far I've only played a few of the 101 games. Some of the games require you to make some minimum score the &#34;buy&#34; the next level.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|This is a hilarious game that keeps you busy for sure! it's just as good, if not better than Angry Birds. AND for younger kids, it's a really good game that works their brain - you have to use problem solving skills to complete the levels. Definitely not a mindless game for sure. It's addictive
B00CUWWLWG|2.0|I obtained a few games so I&#34;d have something to do during the long car trip while on vacation. This game is OK but cannot be played without a Wi-Fi connection. it also seems geared more for children than adults.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|I played the card game when I was young and to see it on the kindle I couldn't refuse. This is a great game to play.
B000FS9FCQ|5.0|i do not want to ruin it for you, but you could look it up on internet movie data base for a trailer if you really want to. i think everyone should at least see this movie.
B000L53D4O|5.0|Bought this at half off for Christmas gifts. What a great deal for a great brand name toy. Kids are going to be thrilled.
B004QZ9PLU|4.0|Sparks never fails to surprise me. I truly enjoyed reading this one, another great surprise reading. Even when I think I know what's about to happen I am shocked once again. On to the next Romantic adventure.
B00AHTYGRW|2.0|Not worth the hype, It's Hollywood patting themselves on the back again. The whole movie is about how Hollywood saved the Americans in Iran. Interesting plot but not worthy of a major motion picture.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Insidious!!!  Makes you think so far outside the box...<br />you can actually lose sight of the box ITSELF!!  Now where did that box go?  Must be a clue around here somewhere.
B0085Z8F4A|2.0|I decided to buy this Blu-ray disc without ever seeing the movie, just going on Faith  that the prequel for Alien would be awesome. After the first viewing and being somewhat entertained I realized this movie had so many weaknesses. I kept thinking they spent $1 trillion on this mission and these are the best scientists they could get? The first thing they do when they get to the planet is take off their helmets? really? There are too many other weaknesses in this movie to mention. Suffice it to say it's not one of the movies I'll be watching over and over again.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game it is so fun and it is a little slow sometimes but it doesn't matter it is amazing
B0067TQQI8|5.0|It is THE perfect Gadget.<br />is nice, simple, and flawless.<br />i fully charged a BBZ10 and a Iphone5 and still have 3/4 of the total charge of the external battery remaining.<br />you only have to push 1 button to turn it on.<br /><br />THE PROS<br />Simple, nice, high quality, long lasting charge, easy use.<br /><br />THE CONS<br />does not come with iphone 5 cable.<br />A little bit thick.
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|great game a lot like battlefield a lot of guns to buy and unlock and i think there is five different classes  there is a helicopter a jeep and a tank. needs more people<br />great game for a free app
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Great cast in wonderful period piece.  Beautiful castle and excuisite costumes. Excited to watch season 3. Glad that all three seasons are here on Amazon prime. :)
B007IXWL2C|3.0|I liked the book but it is typical mommy porn.  If you liked the first two books you will be ok with this one.
B004UID2LC|1.0|THIS APP IS MESSING UP MY KINDLE FIRE ITS REALLY BAD DO NOT GET THIS APP PLEASE DONT GET THIS APP
B00CATSONE|2.0|I was expecting a biography of Nikola Tesla's life. What I got in the beginning was an essay of what traits make up a genius (hence the word 'Imagination' from the title - I should have guessed from that clue alone what was ahead). I wasn't in the mood for a discussion on \\"What makes a genius a genius\\", I was in the mood for a biography. Hence the low rating.<br /><br />Sean Patrick comes across as knowing what he is talking about. You can tell he has done his research and put a lot of thought into this essay. And it is well-written, those of you looking to engage in this topic will very much enjoy what he has to say.<br /><br />Then we finally get to the biography part of the book. Adaquate, I would have enjoyed a bit more detail - but then...<br /><br />The book ends with Sean Patrick's summation of his essay. Fair enough. Am I sorry I read this book? No! Sean has sparked a tad of curiousity in me concerning a certain 'black box' which draws off a mysterious power source causing an electric car to hit speeds of 90 mph. THAT certainly screams for being looked into. What was in that black box? What happened to it? Is it stashed away somewhere in a government warehouse? Why hasn't anyone attempted to hunt it down?<br /><br />Now if Sean wrote about Tesla's lost black box, I'd certainly read it!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I like horses, and I like this game. It`s fun and entertaining. Although the mini games can get a bit monotonous, the competitions are fun. I would like to see a bit more variety to the mini games when visiting friends. Still, it`s a fun game, so I recommend it to anyone who likes horses, especially if you don`t have one of your own.
B00B10DZQE|5.0|I loved this movie. It was really great. This was an inspiring story to me. Everyone should get it. It's worth the watch. Live like Jay
B007SGLZP8|4.0|After reading Racketeer I have no desire to own that much gold. Even if owning it legally. A very convoluted story but difficult to predict the ending.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I loved the other two books and couldn't wait for this one to come out.  I was so disappointed at the ending.  I had no idea that this was not the end of the story...........She could have easily completed the story with this third book.  I LOVE books with lots of sex however,  she could have left half of it out and finished the story or atleast ended it better if it had to be continued.  Writing a 4th book to this story will really be dragging it out and I really don't care when it comes out.
0399255370|5.0|We so love this book! Great illustrations and pretty funny.  My husband was even chuckling!  Makes color learning fun and silly.
B00AO686MY|5.0|It's hard to believe it's been 25 years since this movie came out. It's as good today as it was then and still can attract fans (all three of my kids loved it, they are ages 10-15). We've watched it once and they are already planning further viewings with their friends.
B00701L5XS|5.0|If knot tieing is a hobby or necessity. this app will be all you need to learn to tie and appropriately use each of the many knots demonstrated. 3D views of each knot from beginning to completion with a description of use and vulnerability if relevant. I love this app it's worth the price and I don't buy very many.
B001AII4RM|5.0|It is especially unique, entertaining, and watchable many times over.  It's difficult to discern whether you're watching animation or live action, it's done so well.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|Not &#34;classical&#34; James Bond, but full of heart, passion, and intensity.<br />The motives for the villain are somewhat lame, but by the time that disappointment arrives the rest of the movie has sold itself.<br />This license is alive and well, but in the future I hope to see more intelligent, more sinister, and more evil plots that 007 must contend with...
B009UWYFFK|1.0|Horrendously awful , story is bad . The animation can look good but is the worst animation by Sony Pictures animation and characters are either underdeveloped or cliche .
B0060MYM3S|5.0|To know Game of Thrones is to love it... assuming you have any soul at all.<br />Each episode and season keeps getting better...
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Have used this cable with a USB device and it works fine.  I would recommend it for charging any device.
B00DC7NNAC|3.0|We were a bit disappointed overall. Not what we expected of a Disney film. Took a long time to build characters and the acting was not up to usual Disney standards. Movie finally caught up and was better toward the end.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|This, i thought was pretty entertaining and can sustain me for hours, recommended for something to do in your free time
B0013TPV0Q|1.0|I thought this book was very disrespectful to human beings on many levels - minorities, mentally challenged.  I found his attempt at humor insulting.  I would not recommend this book and would never read another of his books.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|free game collect bananas to get better score agenst friends from facebook! kinda like temple run! except with Minions and stuff.
B00BI73CVI|5.0|love it a lot. Great musicals. The connection speed is fast. The movie has a great quality. Definitely recommend if you love musicals
B002FQOI0A|3.0|The book was alrite. But I have to say the other was all over the place with her writing. And I didn't get what the point of the book was till the end.... which really frustrated me.
B007VUCAVO|4.0|This app does just what I want it to. If you're unsure you can always get the free version. All in all it's a pretty good app.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|Very funny and entertaining.  I highly recommend it that you watch this movie.  The music is fantastic and Rebel Wilson is a real stand-out!
B008S0IJAM|2.0|the NPR show samples are shorter and better, with thoughtful commentary, but listening to the album got me down.  download the NPR podcast on All Songs Considered for free!
B00BFBSV72|5.0|I LOVE SONIC HE IS AWESOME THIS GAME IS WORTH THE 2 BUCKS!!!!!!!<br />THIS IS LIKE DOODLE JUMP AND SONIC IN ONE!!!!!!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Another excellent book by Nicholas Sparks.  Not his typical ending - this was definately a better ending than most of his books.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This app is the best. I always wanted a portable minecraft for my kindle fire. It is an excellent app!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Addicting and a very good game. Each level has a new kind of puzzle that keeps you on your toes.
B005LAIGNC|5.0|Great special effects and cinematography.  Story line and acting also top notch and do a great job of telling a story that needs to be told.
B000VK99Z6|5.0|I really love this movie.  Simon Pegg and Nick Frost are a great team.  And with director Edgar Wright you can't go wrong.  Funny from start to finish.  And I hope this team makes lots of movies together.  Hope to see the Andy's in a future film.
B0084IG7KC|5.0|This movie is good to watch multiple times.  No need to go into too much detail since everything that can be said about the movie has already been said.  Just buy it.
0785168109|5.0|The books of the series &#34;the art of&#34; are simply amazing. Honestly, I think this is one of the best, I'm a huge fan of Iron Man's armory. And it's all detailed here. Must buy!
B00CL68NOG|1.0|I thought this movie was really going to be good, but to be honest with you it had a depressing mood to it.  Sure there were just a few funny Ha Ha lines but overall not worth the money or time
B004G0SJU8|4.0|It is a little fairy tale but due to the Meg and Nicholas star power, it gets you hooked. The ending is rather a disappointment.
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|The game is good but some parts don't make sense, such as how much things cost~bikes,riders.....~ and even more.<br />Have fun playing!
B0070DOHQS|4.0|I like the app .Very easy to use. I got it connected to my laptop. Even though I have not used it extensively to make use of it but still see it is a very good app.
B007B5EDEG|5.0|Can't put this book/these books down, totally addictive!!<br />Not much more to say really. It wants 4 more words though, ok can stop now!
B007XF4J70|5.0|A definite must-have for fans of the movie. It looks even great in bluray and keeps urging me to ~play it again~. :D
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Omygodd. Suzanne Collins you are a fantastic writer and the hunger games serious is the best thing I've ever put my eyes on. I love this. I hate it had to end. I was on an emotional rollercoaster I couldnt read it in public. The end was amazing I wanted Peeta and Katniss together. But I wonder...Wheres Gale? What happened to him? I bet he was upset .But yes. This was a fabulous book.
B000SQFC18|4.0|Good movie and ok edition for the dvd. I was hoping it'd be available in bluray but I chose this over that cos of the features.
B00CL1SR7O|5.0|BTR's music just keeps getting better and better! I love every single song on here! THEY'RE SOOOOO FREAKING AMAZING! :D I was a tad disappointed that they didn't have lots of album art and the lyrics to the songs in the little booklet like they usually do, but that's okay because the amazing songs more than make up for it! Also, the case arrived cracked in three places and the cover won't stay attached, but that can easily be fixed by transferring everything to a new empty case. I LOVE 24/SEVEN!!!! WOO-HOO! :D:D:D:D
B001U0HBQ0|5.0|But I already own this in  regular DVD that is also The Criterion Collection. I never get sick of it and seeing it in crisp beautiful bluray doesn't tire me at all.
B006GECE9Y|5.0|I have only been using dolphin for a little while and I think it's great  as now I can play games on Facebook where before I couldn't  without dolphin browser
B004QOB8SY|5.0|I think that about sums it up for me. I love the series but A Scandal in Belgravia is pretty much the only reason I even bought it and it's all worth it!
B006PAV1XO|2.0|Bill Hader made the movie watchable... well the parts that he's in.  The rest of the movie was a little uncomfortable, well more than a little uncomfortable.  I just remember refusing to watch Zombieland for what may be years because I saw this movie and didn't think Jesse Eisenberg was in it.  Long story short, Jesse Eisenberg isn't that bad, I guess but this movie is anything but remarkable.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I want the old version back.  Lost 1/3 of screen to adds.  Screen much to busy.  Removing g it from my Fire:(
B0040I09RM|4.0|Wanting to watch this top rated show for a long time. Finally sat down and started watching.  Hooked on the first episode.
B001AQMBNC|5.0|This is the widescreen addition. I've been looking for this for a very long time.<br /><br />This is a fun little space alien movie. It has action, adventure, mystery, sadness and drama.<br />Amazing performances by Jeff Bridges and Karen Allen (From Indiana Jones).
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Downton Abbey please watch from the start season 1 and you would love it. It tells the story of a wealthy English and sometimes snobby family with a American wife, and also the servant downstairs. Very interesting to watch you cannot wait till the next episode give it a try.
B004EPYZQ2|4.0|This is a fun movie movie to watch. Steven Speilberg does it again. This is another kid finds alien movie for Steven although it's a lot scarier.
B007C7UZIG|1.0|I don't like it...there are no way to ensure my minor children are prevented from adult conversations...I would like a way to set up monitoring...several people approached my daughter into online sexual role playing.  She is forbidden to use it now.
B008JEJN8O|5.0|I love these Crocs. it's the most comfortable summer footwear.foot comfortable in them and spacious. great for wide feet.thank you
B007TBZ63Y|4.0|I have always enjoyed Rick Riordan. I don't like this series quite as well as the original Lightning Thief. I'm not quite as engaged with the characters somehow.
B0031RAOVY|4.0|I have seen this movie several times and cant help but cry.Its the sadest  animal movie ever but really good.
0439023521|1.0|I hated the subject and plot.... Gladiators for kids.. Killing for someone else's amusement.. Not a good read at all.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It's not too difficult and keeps me busy.  I wish there was some variety in solving the puzzles (I.e. color coding)  but other than that good job.

B003VANOFY|4.0|I love the head set but the only problem is that the usb is too big thus making it easy to break
B0001O3YEE|5.0|Watching all the old Movies getting ready for the new one coming out soon. Love this series. Great actors too.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Really fun and also challenging! I really enjoyed it. Each room is different and a nee challenge every time... I just there were more levels so I could play more.
B009E3EWPI|4.0|.. open...quiet screen shot..some credits...suddenly..WHAM!!! Jason Bonham's BOMB BLAST drum intro \\"Good Times Bad Times\\"!- & all the classic songs.  WOW! Led Zeppellin !! like I've never HEARD them before!! These gentlemen really know how to perform! They sound like they have been together, practicing this whole time. Jimmy sounded astonishing,and Robert has just the right inflections and terrific range. Jason seems to have the esoteric skills AND slam of his dad, and John Paul Jones weaves the whole thing together on his vintage bass and delightful keyboard mastery. The chemistry is very obvious, even though Jason admits he was nervous as h--- before he went on stage! What a tribute to Ahmet, and to John Bonham.--And a BIG thanks to Dick Carruthers for putting this together!! DVD looks great and the sound is very very good.--This is a DVD that goes into my 'regular play' rotation!!!  Also; MANY reviewers seem to be a bit nitpicky regarding the editing etc---REMEMBER, This is THE MOST RECENT 1-and-only LATEST available record of this LEGENDARY band!! and I'm delighted to have it!!!  tyvm
0930289234|5.0|Alan Moore, Dave Gibbons and John Higgins grabbed the comics genre by the b***s and flipped it upside down. This is post-modern mystery men with one super who acts like a super would really act. Who needs to either help or rule puny humans when one is a god?<br /><br />The characters are eminently memorable, and the artwork matches the feel of the book. This is a true graphic novel, not a bunch of adolescent comics books stuck together. Comics are visual first and writing second, but this bends both ways. It skips through time and space like a novel, but the imagery is both stimulating and sad.<br /><br />Takeoffs of takeoffs never work. That's a rule. But The creators took MAD magazine's Superdooperman and twisted it from humor and satire to drama and pathos. They made it work, and it works brilliantly.<br /><br />I'd rate it with the great novels of its time.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|The full range of human personalities and attributes of human behavior is depicted. I don't see how it could get any better. After the first 3 or 4 episodes, I was hooked.
B007EC27QM|5.0|After trying a multitude of calculators from both Amazon and Google, I'd given up finding one I like.<br /><br />Then I stumbled on this jem and I couldn't be more happy.<br /><br />Clean simple interface.<br /><br />Large keys for my old eyes.<br /><br />Easy access to a few advanced functions I do use occasionally.<br /><br />Using on a Nexus 7 running Jelly Bean 4.2.
B008NW67E0|3.0|a couple of good songs that have some good folksy feel .  alot of repetition though.  get the good songs from itune
B009UMTMKS|5.0|To me, this is an absolute must-read book for anyone starting a business in todays internet world.<br />Very useful information and insight.
B001CDD84Y|4.0|Good concept, and love the simplicity applied to the Jumpscar. The acting could have been better. Nice use of locations.
B00846TRHY|2.0|I watched the movie on Netflix, because I thought It was gonna be another one of those Punisher-like movies. I was very dissapointed with the movie because it felt like the movie was constructed very poorly. Gerard Butler goes from being this outlaw biker dude to being this almost creepishly obsessive religious guy. The movie was moving very slow and I just was not able to continue watching because there was nothing happening. The movie had no flow, and scenes were just inserted, having no cohesion.<br /><br />I would not have expected this movie to receive 4 stars.... Poor acting.
B0067TGSOK|5.0|This book is educational and inspirational. I enjoyed every page. It is the perfect place to start if you are ready to begin following the road to an authentic life for yourself. It is never to late to start but waiting longer shouldn't be an option. This book is well written,engaging, and truly takes you step by step through each step to your fresh start with valid and comprehensive content. I fully recommend.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|I am using this item while on a road trip where my wife has an iPhone 5 and I have an iPhone 4s.  Plugging the 5 into the apple port and the 4s into the android port, both phones charge nicely and with a 3-in-1 USB 3.5mm AUX Audio cable for the 4s we can listen to music at the same time.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|One of the best puzzle games ive played in a long time. Made you think and back track and figure out how to get the next piece. Cannot wait for more!
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Really enjoy this show, especially after all the harshness of other cable shows.  Good family entertainment.  Clever, clean and suspenseful.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|The life of Pi is a one of the best novel ever written, the suspense was incredible and very interesting. I would stay up all night reading this adventure. It felt like you were Pi, being stranded in a simple rowboat, stuck in the middle of the sea with a zebra, arangatan, hyena, and of course, a tiger. The survival was killer intense(I could feel my heart beat). This book was indeed, TRULY AMAZING!
B0010SKUYM|5.0|Good Read! Held my attention from the very first chapter.<br />All around great book, had me crying one chapter and laughing out loud in the next. Great character development and you fall into the story quickly.
B004ZN9W5M|4.0|I guess it's my fault for not realizing how dark the themes on this album are.  It's still worth it, but a fair warning to any consumer this music is messed up.<br />Side note: the CD case is made of paper/cardboard and ripped when I tried to get the first disc out.  It didn't ruin the anything, but now I have to look at that every time I want to listen to this.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|Love the game but wish we could open treasure chests without pearls. I will not put real money into a free game.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|I have read all of the Tom Clancy Novels, this latest novel is by far one of the best, thus my 5 star rating.
B009NY43NY|3.0|I have read and loved all the Sookie Stackhouse books.  I thought the last book would bring closure.  It seems to leave you guessing if she would actually stay and be happy with Sam.
B00BLGXL3U|2.0|Was not that thrilled.  it just didn't leave you wanting more. Just couldn't get that much into it.  Wouldn't recommend.
B003UYUP58|5.0|I heard about this book from the author himself, when he read from it during a talk at the New York Academy of Sciences.  I was startled by how beautifully it was written and profoundly stirred by his passion for his mission.  Despite being an oncologist himself, Dr. Mukheerjee does not indulge in jargon;  you always understand what he is writing and his compassion for his patients shines through on every page.  I am not at all surprized that this book won a Pulitzer Prize in 2011!  If you are curious about how we came to understand what we do about cancer, or  how medical science is emeshed with politics, you will find it fascinating, as well.
B0020M99LC|5.0|Loved the movie.  Lots of action , and it is always a pleasure to watch Daniel Craig.  I want to buy it now/
B0090KZDSK|5.0|I will be looking forward to get more from Eva and Gideon. Nice books from Sylvia Day. Can't wait till next.

034580404X|5.0|I loved the story! Wish we could have more Christian POV because I couldn't get enough of his thoughts! .
0752826948|5.0|Harry Bosch has always been introspective and introverted: that is part of his mystique and charm. In \\"Angels Flight\\" his partner, Kiz Rider, lovingly refers to him as being one of those \\"morose detectives who never say much of anything to anybody.\\" However, in this novel Harry is even more morose, more soul-searching than in most that I have read. There are the usual ruminations about his tragic childhood and the references to his experiences in Vietnam. But in just about every other chapter, Bosch takes a close look at himself. Here are just two examples:<br /><br />\\"The idea of a man leaving his mark with the one shot he's given appealed to him... he had the feeling that it was still out there waiting for him. He had yet to take his one shot.\\"<br /><br />\\"He knew somehow that he would be spared, that the righteous man was beyond the grasp of the fallen.\\"<br /><br />There are plenty of reasons for this constant self-inspection in \\"Angels Flight\\": his marriage to Eleanor Wish is rapidly dissolving; his actions might set the whole city on fire, literally; and his friendship with an old partner is heading down a very, very dangerous path. And all this gravitates around a brutal execution on a Los Angeles landmark, the Angels Flight. Bosch is quick to grasp that angels can fly two ways: upward to heaven or downward with the other fallen angels.<br /><br />Time and again, Michael Connelley has proven himself to be one of our generation's most gifted writers. He is not just a mystery/crime novelist. And \\"Angels Flight\\" is as much a brilliant literary work as anything else that came out that year.
B002DQLGHU|1.0|Terrible movie. A real waste of money. Fictional characters dominated by witchcraft. Not something you would want young children to watch.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Kept my attention and I started the second book in the series.  It has captured my attention also. Love the lending library.
B005JTAP4S|3.0|Get ready for a long helter-skelter ride in an alternative world where young Peter encounters many strange and curious characters. He meets mice, elves, monsters in the sir, in the water and on land. There is much magic going on and Peter is soon entrusted on a mission which seems impossible and even doomed to fail. It all begins with a mysterious box with odd contents including a key, and a tall clock which is the doorway to the mystical kingdom.<br />This is definitely an adult tale with enough gore, blood and death to make the reader cringe. It is indeed \\"A darkened fairytale\\". It isn't my cup of tea and I struggled to complete it. But fans of mystical lands, elves and monsters, where every thing turns chaotic and the hero is lost in the confusion, will love this book.
B007FIY3VW|3.0|For a free app it provided just what I needed just when I needed it. I would recommend it and figure I'll be using it over and over.
B00CEB5QU2|5.0|I bought this with the intent of using it for backing up my photos on vacation. I didn't want to bring a laptop, and even considered copying RAW and JPG files to the cloud for backup. I discovered this product entirely by chance, and after testing it out for a few days, here's my preliminary impressions.<br /><br />Yes, you can use it to backup photos from your SD cards. With the MobileLite app running on my iPad mediating the process, I can transfer MOV, RAW & JPG files to a portable USB hard drive connected to the MobileLite Wireless (MLW) from an SD card. I'm impressed that it's able to power a 1 Tb Seagate Backup Plus USB 3.0 and transfer files. The iPad can't display RAW files, but the MOV and JPG files are no problem. Transferring a large number of files can be a bit tedious though, because the app makes you select files one at a time, although the transfer is done by batch.<br /><br />It also works great to stream movies from the hard drive to my iPad via WiFi. The movies display well and show no signs of hiccups. JPGs stored on the USB drive or SD card will also display on the iPad. Great way to check your shots without having to import them to the iPad. Make sure to turn on the security when you set up the MLW.<br /><br />The MLW charges its internal battery with the provided USB cable. The battery can be used as a backup battery for your phone, but I didn't try it. I presume it'll work. Please note that the MLW does not come with any built-in storage.<br /><br />So, for a rather low cost (even lower if you already have a portable USB drive), you can have a backup/wireless streaming solution for travel. Light and compact too! I can probably fit the drive and the MLW with cables into one of those portable hard drive cases. And, it works with my iPad or iPhone. An Android app is available too. No need to lug around a laptop!
B0060MYM3S|3.0|I may step on some toes here, but after watching two seasons it finally became clear what I miss on this series. I love the genre, I love the acting, story is great too and the scenery is splendid. But I missed something. In series two it became clear what it was: the screenplay.<br /><br />A picture says more than a thousand words. As such it is the hard task of a screenplay writer to translate long sections of text into often just seconds of film. But he or she also must make sure the relevant elements in these segments are still noticed by the viewers. Also sometimes pages of text are to build characters and therefore important. In season 2, this is where it derails on occasion.<br /><br />Sometimes long scenes are wasted on things which even in hindsight added little character or storyline. E.g. Snow's story is full of these details. Now I like, no love, slow stories and even more so Snow's character, but in the end every second of film is at the expense of another. It is not and-and, but or-or in the expensive business of film. So the result is that on other occasions important events are a bit rushed. Out of now where two new kings with massive 100.000 men pop up, making the hard struggle of the North with its original 18.000 men not so heroic and impressive. Or Winterfell is seen burning with little explanation on where its sieging friendlies have gone.<br /><br />Note, before someone tries to comment on these specific examples. All of them have explanations, but it is the mapping of the events in the books onto the film in terms of time spend which go wrong on occasion.<br /><br />That said, the acting is very good, and so is the décor and storyline itself. I'll be buying season 3 for sure, but season 2 was not as great as season 1 due to the lesser screenplay.<br /><br />To finish the review. The DVD box itself is of high quality. Except the gluing of the outside inner box is sloppy. Both in season 1 and 2 the paper on it was lose out-of-the-box. Nothing some office glue could fix, but this should not happen with such an otherwise great quality DVD box.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Great graphics and good puzzles. I had a great time solving this game. More please. This games should have many rooms.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This will keep you busy for a while. Lots of fun. It is challenging to the point I had to use pen and paper to write down details. Great for a rainy day.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|These three books have been great.  I can't wait for the fourth book to come out to see how things end up.  I couldn't put the books down!

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I hope there is Season 4, I absolutely enjoyed every minute watching how the story developed into<br />happy moments and horribly sad ones.  It really is about a huge family upstairs and below.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|This is a totally engrossing tale and a parable on being human in the natural world of animals and earth's elements--up close and personal, while the world of the spirit informs all. Will read it again and again.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|great app you get your very own virtual horse and you name it and take care of it and you level up as well its just a great app
B0064X7FVE|1.0|this used to be the best weather apt for kindle, Now with july'13 update it is the worst. Is crashing and freezing since the moment the update came. the radar is fuzzy alot and cannot be seen clearly. unless it is fixed there are others that are better. deleted from my kindle fire. do not bother it's not worth the trouble
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this is a realy a good game and if you are reading this you might whant to buy it it is just a realy good game
B00C1BHQXK|4.0|It's about One Thing so you can't expect much, but it's a great reminder of a principle to a fullfilling and disciplined life: focus, and make sure to make your One Thing a priority.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|the book was recommended to me by a couple different friends with varying tastes who all loved it, so I figured it was worth a read.  I couldn't put the book down and found the writing to be engaging, witty and unique while the story was touching and impressively crafted.
B009PEKRY6|5.0|I never knew Brigit Mendler could sing. I love her acting talent but never would have guessed this girl had soul like she does! album makes me all feel good-ish inside! MUST BUY! you will not regret it!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|i wish there was more then 10 levels.  it is a bit of a challenge but not so difficult that it is impossible to finish.
B00B2QG3K2|5.0|well, according to Amazon's rate rules, I have to say a bit more, but Paramore is the absolute BEST band out there, in fact this album was rated #1 on the Billboard 200 list in April 2013 with over 106,422 sales!!!!!!!
B00A81MV3U|5.0|When I watched the trailer I didn't think the movie would be that great, but I was very wrong. This movie is hilarious! It is one of my favorite movies. It's has a good cast and the humor just makes the movie.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|Initial review was in regards to crashing on kindle fire.<br />App has been working for months now, until the latest update.  Now it is saying there is an update, which forces you to the app store.  There is nothing to download.  From the app store the only option is open the app.  Clicked on update all apps and there are none to update.<br /><br />This game is really fun and is very enjoyable for my two little girls.  They both love it.
B00866JL96|4.0|It didn't drift too far from the book, which is always a plus when they make a movie off of a book. I am a big Zac Efron fan and this was one of his better movies.
B00AY7Q01C|5.0|This is a must see story of redemption. It is the butterfly effect of human existence.<br />I wish I could see his show in NYC in Oct. Humility and love are enduring.
B006Y5H74W|5.0|It's just the kind of show I love. And steaming one or two shows a day makes it even better. I love streaming!
0920668372|1.0|Some nice friend of ours gave this book to us when our son was born. I have always found the mother's feelings for the son to be a little....strange. The part that I find creepy is when the mother sneaks into her grown son's bedroom in the middle of the night and cradles him while he sleeps. Something not quite right about that. It seems like she's unable to let him grow up and away from her. Later I kept thinking, \\"I wonder how this guy's wife feels about his oddly close relationship with his clingy mother.\\" I'm all for parents having unconditional love for their children, but it's also important that your children know that your entire life does not revolve around them. I'm sure people will think I'm overthinking this, but this is not what I want my kids thinking a healthy parent-child relationship looks like.
0547884591|5.0|Just as described!  I love the product.  Would highly recommend.  Would definitely do business again!  Thanks for the fulfillment of my expectations.
B0000013GT|4.0|All the songs are good but to me the clear stand out track is 'Atliens'.<br />The rest sound very similar because the beats are very basic but overall production is good.<br />Good lyrics, no gangster rap here.<br />But, I can't help but wonder how much more I would've liked it if I had got it 15 years earlier when it was fresh.
030746363X|5.0|Just as described!  I love the product.  Would highly recommend.  Would definitely do business again!  Thanks for the fulfillment of my expectations.
B00004TH6O|3.0|The first couple of times thru this album I enjoyed it. The songs seemed fresh and original. The instruments are played well and the production is good without sounding over-produced.  But, listening to it again a couple years later only one or two songs seem worth keeping.
B004TO3UZK|5.0|This ergonomic mouse truly lessens the stress and strain on your wrist.  It may take a few times to be accustomed to the mouse's design and applicable buttons.  However, the time and money invested in this product is worth every penny.<br /><br />I highly recommend this product.<br /><br />Beth
B0089LOG02|4.0|Living over seas I had never hear about these story's. Very much enjoy it. Was a lovely read. The cold people live in then and may be now?

B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway suffers is the #1 game in my head. My family approves of it. My neighbor is 4 and he plays better than me. It is a game for all ages even the elderly.
B00C7JGDBW|4.0|This was a nice movie to watch.  I especially liked how they made references to &#34;The Wizard of Oz.&#34;  It brought together who the wizard was to become.
B008FRFN7A|4.0|I chose this app when I purchased a printer that eprints. I tested it yesterday using my son's university email address to make sure it would work for him. After following the directions printed from the new printer, it worked well. I still need to find a way to eprint from my kindle. I have the app and would like to print recipes from an online cooking magazine. Haven't figured out how yet, so I will update after I try it. I don't know how much we will use this, but it is available if we need it. All in all, it does what it says it will and it's FREE. Can't beat that!
B00846TRHY|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie. Although a lot of violence, it really made me think about life more about life.
B00BEJOMIW|5.0|One of my favor movies with Robert Redford and Mia Farrow. I love watching the high quality Blue Ray version.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|I was upset after Google shut down Reader. I had read some good reviews on Feedly but saw some negatives saying it didn't sync with Feedly Cloud on the Fire version. I guess that was in the past because it works great now. I love that it syncs to my phone and web as well so I don't have to sift through things I have already read when I change devices.<br /><br />Highly recommend Feedly
B0028R3NCU|5.0|Thank God this little thing has the string to attach to a keyring or something.  This is very small, but well worth the money.  My old one which was huge, stopped working.  I ordered two of these, they arrived promptly and worked like a charm.  Am very pleased with everything about this product.  No down-side at all.  A++++++++++++
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this app it is so fun if you are even considering getting this app GET IT. I have no doubt that that you will love this app. and it's free! you can't go wrong!
B003G4W49C|5.0|It's always a great pleasure to be engrossed in a breathless story. And in that story, to discover everything you thought you knew was something else indeed.
B003BW0CB6|4.0|Typical Connelly.  A bit predictable, but his usual attention to detail relative to the legal processes again proved to be educational as well as highly interesting.  It shed a bit more light on my daughters feelings about defense lawyers as she is a federal prosecutor.  Enjoyable read as always.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I bit my tongue trying not wake my son up by yelling at the computer screen while I was watching this season. Action packed, thick with plot and plenty of tragedy. The writers captured real personalities of humanity in this show so much more clearly than in other programs. Right down to the fact that you can't corrupt a person who knows it is better to die a good person than to love a bad one, men with power will only ever want more power at any cost and that the end of the world truly sucks. I was glued to the computer for three days because I couldn't wait to find out what happened. GREAT SHOW!!
B004W1GCNC|2.0|Had to make myself finish the episode.<br />I found it very boring and uninteresting. I don't Care for the film.

B0044XV3R8|5.0|*Limited Conceptual Spoilers - Read at your own discretion*<br /><br />Instant Classic!<br /><br />I really appreciate works of art that make you think, explore deep issues, and provide a satisfying conclusion.  This movie delivers abundantly on each point.  Some, like this one or Star Wars or The Lord of the Rings, do it in a more cinematic and action adventure way, whereas others, like the Fountain or Solaris or Cloud Atlas, do it in a much deeper, more intensely personal and emotionally driven way that can leave you weeping for days and frankly require multiple viewings to truly understand them; but I appreciate both methods.  So what is Avatar all about?  Read on.<br /><br />Avatar is a massive cinematic action adventure with spectacular effects and a deeply engrossing story line that effectively portrays the clash between those driven solely by the limited pursuit of economic gain and personal prejudice vs those more interested in a deeply spiritual, connected and rewarding way of life.  The visuals, alone, of the various Pandoran ecological zones, are worth the price of admission.<br /><br />I really liked the idea that a wheelchair bound military veteran could be an action hero star (albeit with the help of technology).  The natives are admirable if a bit simplistic, and the human villains are over the top bad. The emotional growth of the hero from mostly self centered and isolated (understandable given his situation) into an empowered native rights and environmental activist is deeply satisfying.  In fact, its interesting to see how each of the five main characters (sorry dont remember names so their roles are: Hero, Native Girl, Doc, Commander, Corporate Guy) and your impression of them changes over the course of the movie.  One, especially poignant, scene is later in the movie and revolves around the concept of the powerful becoming helpless if certain basic environmental variables changes.  (Viewers should be able to figure out which scene I am talking about – think Pod.)  This is poignant because we as a species tend to think something or someone is either powerful or weak and that status is somehow permanent – which it is not.  Change is inevitable of course, everything changes, but we just don’t like to believe that, so we push it out of our minds and pretend its not true.<br /><br />I realize some people object to certain aspects of the movie (they would argue its too emotional, too simplistic, etc) but if we as a species do not wake up, grow up (stop being self focused) and accept responsibility for our own actions - then we will get what we deserve.  Perhaps this movie might spark that realization.<br /><br />Anyways, I heartily recommend this movie and hope you enjoy it.
B005ZOCF5E|4.0|Good read start s a little slow but picks up in the middle.  He keeps the plot twisting throughout the book.

B004ZMWUCU|3.0|Interesting story about people held back by family, duty, appearances, the past,feelings of insignificance and how they overcome it all.
B002361MLA|1.0|I actually don't doubt that Eckhart Tolle had an experience of awakening, but this book shows what happens when you make a concept out of your experience, and then proceed to idealize it. The difference between him and many other spiritual practitioners who have had awakening experiences is that he decided to write a book about it and craft it into a source of income.<br /><br />You can certainly do worse in the spiritual literature section than this book. But this gets 1 star because you can do a whole lot better and very easily.
1452101248|5.0|What a gorgeously done book...I cannot wait for the one coming in September! Since I was in their fab shop in the Belgravia area of London, I know their recipes are wonderful! CB
0761172726|5.0|I am organized to a fault... usually!  With two kids, sports, work duties and a husband who frequently travels, I have found the perfect organizer!  I found the wall calendar to work great in the kitchen and the kids love putting on stickers and filling in the birthdays and special events for me!  The format works great, and I just add activities for each person as they come up. I use the fifth column for \\"babysitters\\" so I know who I have booked for date night.  I definitely recommend this item. (as an aside, the orgnizer/notebook that you can order with it I didn't find as helpful..) I am about to order this item for the 4th time because I love it so much.
B00006LFGD|5.0|Her voice is timeless.  Always a treat to listed to her. These songs and duets are classic.  One of my favorite cds.
B00CC8789O|4.0|I could not pinpoint if the movie promotes crime or something better. Criminals won at the end. Or tell me?
B0052GACNM|5.0|Tony and the assembled partners are amazing.  Totally floored by Lady Gaga and Amy Winehouse. I first heard this on PBS and now am glad I bought the cd.
B005LAII0I|5.0|Imagination was used in creating the story, found it had humor and some little off the wall things. How about giant dwarfs?
B0002X314C|3.0|I was a little disappointed.  But lots of people like him, so I will listen several times to see if it grows on me too.
1401307957|5.0|The book is so nice to read. I was so excited to get it that when it did finally come I sat down as soon as I got home and read the whole thing in one go. I really think that when I am in a creative rut - this will help! I am excited to NEED the inspiration so that I can open up this fantastic book! Danny Gregory seems like such a nice person and it was so fantastic to learn a little more about him through this book.<br /><br />I do wish there were more colored drawings. But, it is still a high quality and fantastic book to have for any artist!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Can sometimes be difficult. Fun to play. The puzzles make you work harder as you get further into the game.
B00CISC2DA|5.0|This is everything anyone could expect from any release by Boards of Canada. There are no sweeping changes in sound or style, but one cannot improve upon perfection. I can wait six or seven years between releases so long as the quality of the product is this consistent. I am extremely pleased with this recording, and I won't belabor the point. Why are you still reading this review? If you even looked this product up, you know in your heart you should purchase it!
0525953590|4.0|If you are looking for a book that trains your brain muscle and rekindle your lost ally of curiosity, this is a book to consider.<br /><br />It is a book on the journey of the discovery of the Higgs Boson particle.  If this particle name sounds Greek to you, how about the other particles like electrons, protons or neutrons?  Isn't it amazing that the world is just made of a few basic particles yet yield such a pleasing variety for our eyes?<br /><br />The author has done a cool job in journeying this discovery of the particle and its relationship to what makes up the mass of matters.  He makes a seemingly PHD topic to quite an enjoyable read and is a test to the readers' curiosity about what the world is made of.<br /><br />Why would anyone care about the discovery of this new particle explaining the mass of matters and could also be proved later to be not completely right?  This is not the kind of discovery straight to cancer cure, a new cool gadget or the like.  Yet consider the discovery of Electricity centuries ago, how much do we rely on it on our daily life today? In its early journey of discovery, Electricity was little more than an intellectual curiosity.<br /><br />Our innate curiosity has beaten us  by pressures of real life.  We stop long time ago asking how the world work, and rather figuring out how to make it work for us.<br /><br />It is a refreshing but a sophisticated read.
B00AFEX83C|5.0|i bought this dvd pr for my sons since the new one is coming out. he loves it . it works great. it came very fast. highly satisfied. would recommend to others
B003G4W49C|5.0|A friend of mine suggested this to me. I am so glad that I got around to reading it. I went back and re read parts of it too! Fun fun fun!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I cant wait for more ,these books are hot and hard to put down . I find myself re-reading why I'm waiting form the next ,I find myself reading another book and in-between other books I go back to this series , thank you for a great read
B008GM1G70|4.0|at times NOT sensible, but overall GREAT concept! I like that real actors are depicted in it and how the imaging, changes from ALMOST regular film/ visual to the animated version..
B00DGMVJAO|2.0|Slow and boring does not even come close to the book I know it's a movie but they should at least  try
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|very fun and exciting game. cannot get enough of this game could be a lil better if more upgrades were available sooner
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|Funny for all ages. Great story.we really lived the minions and all the characters. Voice if Steve Carrell was an added bonus.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Fun game! It could have a bit more instruction to help you get started. It takes a little time to figure out what to do.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|What can I say?  This was one of the b e st books I have read this year. Never bored with the story or characters.  It was well written throughout. Get I t and read it,I know I was glad I did.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I'm 16 &amp; it's addicting! lol cant wait to see the movie<br />oh &amp; it can be slow loading sometimes
B0042RJWTM|5.0|Loved the story- fantastic acting-Lee Marvin and Jack Palance were so believable  as the original cowboy and how each took a different view on the changing of the cowboys role and how they would accept the changing times-jt
B009POCG5Y|5.0|Typical Eastwood direction, clean and to the point.  Good for people interested in the aging process and for those who don't age well.  Like me.  Also for those who love baseball.
B00474IVGA|5.0|I love this movie, and I could watch it every day...that's how much I love this movie, the songs rock, and the actors/actresses are awesome!!!
0688152023|2.0|The aspects of this so called workout book is; it really is one long advertisement for the NYC Ballet. There is some work out but it seems like a \\"heavy\\" pitch to show case and advertise NYC Ballet.<br />A work out book? NOT SO MUCH! This book should not be \\"billed\\" as a work out instruction book. It's many other things but not work out.<br /><br /> After pages and pages of this self-absorption, cameo shots of the NYC dancers, indeed half the book,they finally get around to the reason I bought this workout book; the actual workout!<br /><br />The workout itself is poorly arranged, poorly written, unclear in directions and desired outcome, and once again with the \\"half-naked\\" men stuff. I get the drift they aren't targeting the women who frequent Amazon to buy work-out books.<br />There are certainly some \\"pretty boy\\" portraits in this book. If you are of THAT persuasion, then this is a wonderful book.<br /><br />For me (and many others)I like traditional ballet, and ballet work outs. This publication pretty much advances what some might call \\"avante guard\\"agenda, but I think with the plethora of pretty boys, you can make up your own mind about who their target audience is. Certainly not middle American women.<br /><br />Of course they strike the pose of someone who is also impressed with themselves SO MUCH and they are naturally \\"curing cancer\\".......<br />Nothing could be more important than what they do, is how this comes across.<br /><br />I find this book self absorbed, and narcissistic. Glad to not<br />be in the world of dance anymore, but where oh where does one find a good balletic workout that actually does what it says it will do?<br /><br />I have a favorite work out book/program; look up Mary Helen in the search box on Amazon. She's a traditional ballerina sort that has taken balletic work out to the next level in a new and wonderful way, and is doing a phenomenal job in how she conveys and portrays her workout instruction! She's not narcissistic or selfabsorbed. and her beauty shines through even though she's not \\"beating her own drum\\". If you want a serious workout, I would NOT buy this.............just one person's opinion!!! This book is NOT for a serious workout, unless you call pouring over half naked guys a work out-then by all means, yes, go for it! yuk. (Freedom of speech and all that!)
B0059WTMLW|5.0|it is a good game, a lot of type sudoku,<br />play it on the train, and it is free, love it.
B007SAKYOM|5.0|Very great album that I truly enjoyed to the point of becoming physically excited.  Go ahead and buy it man!
B00AVFO41K|4.0|this game is very fun, but there is one thing that isn't very fun about it... every time you make a move, more balls pop up.  another thing, even you first start playing the game, you don't really know how to play. but, if you read the title of the game again, you know you have to MATCH 5 IN A ROW! The game is very addictive. NOTE: THIS GAME MAY MAKE YOU ANGRY AT IT. JUST START OVER AND TRY AGAIN!! :)
B00CF34B2I|5.0|I've been playing this series since its first release and each time they add just enough to show real progress. Sealed deck play and an Android release make this the best yet.
B004A8ZX2I|4.0|This movie was ordered on impulse and I had no idea what to expect; fortunately it turned out to be an entertaining film that held our attention all the way through. The movie starts out innocently enough and one wonders where the adventure could come from with such a prosaic sounding story ahead. What happens is full of the unexpected and leaves the viewer wondering how in the world is the movie going to explain all that?<br /><br />Well, explain it the movie does and in a completely satisfactory manner with no loose ends of any significance. This is an entertaining evening's adventure that has minimal violence and is suitable for the family. I recommend it.
B008N9AAQ4|5.0|Great picture quality. Showing unusual places and cultures accompanied by beautiful music. Great continuation of the series. If you liked two first buy this one.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I enjoyed it but it could use more rooms. :) anyone can get through them fairly quickly with a little thinking ;)
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I read all the books and the movie stayed right on track, loved it.hope the second movie does the same.
B007ZXK08C|5.0|Expect the unexpected! Great story, reminds me of 'we need to talk about Kevin' if u liked that, you'll like this!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|However, since it's free I can't complain.  I really liked being able to explore the whole room. Also, the fact that on some levels it was a bit more intricate than 100 floors. Thanks for the game!
B00AVFO41K|2.0|On easiest, I maxed out at 560. Maybe less balls in the face would be a good thing unless you like to be regularly beaten. A swap left to right or top to bottom option would do wonders for this game. Even with all the negative reviews, I thought that I would give the game a chance. I'm still not sure if it is worth more than 2 stars but I see potential.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|It doesn't help me at all. I can't get the game that is on face book on my Kindle Fire HD.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|Love both games and would recommend to anyone that this game rocks and how do u play as a zombie I kinda want to know
B00B8WXFWE|5.0|NKOTB just get's better and better each Time, the come out, with a New Album !<br />Proud to call myself a Blockhead 4 Life !
B005HSL626|5.0|Great game for all ages. Entertaining and a good way to pass time. No money spent so its a win win.
B004N868DS|1.0|Huge hard mouse pad.  For get about using it on a regular slide out computer desk tray.  Hard material totally Impractical for everyday use.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|If you liked Temple Run, you're going to LOVE Temple Run 2. It's in a different setting with different things to collect. Another thing--it's free!
B006N0YWGY|5.0|I have played this game several times and I have fun each time. For me, it's very addicting and I'm not a 'game' person, however, I really love playing it.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|This game took a really long time to load, and then I couldn't even escape from it. I had to shut my whole device down and start it up again. I WAS looking forward to playing, but I guess not.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This is a cool game to play on my fire. Makes the brain work, for a change. Bring on the new levels.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|This is a nice update to the classic Missile Defender from the 70s.  Game play and control is easy and manageable on a tablet.  I like the coin and upgrade system so you get to keep up with the challenge as you progress through the levels.  This game is fun for adults and for young gamers!
B00D6BQG1W|3.0|It was a cute movie but a little slow at times. It had a happy ending, which made up for the slowness of the movie at times. I would watch it on cable (for free), but I wouldn't pay for it.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I'm a newcomer to watching Masterpiece Theatre and I am totally hooked on this wonderful series!  Lots of twists and turns, and so many you don't see coming.  Can't wait for next season and what it will bring!
B003JTHWJQ|5.0|Anyone who values reason and empirical data will find Dawkin's arguments very compelling.  Also he writes at a level I can understand, especially about the scientific arguments.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|A BIT DISAPPOINTING BECAUSE IT WAS NOT THE END OF IT. I CAN'T WAIT TO READ THE NEXT FEW BOOKS FOR THE OUTCOME
B0007KTBIU|1.0|I was so excited to see my childhood favorite come in the mail! only to find when i opened it that the dvd had a scratch and the dvd case itself was snapped in half:/
B00BUAEYVK|4.0|25 years since the first Die Hard and this is probably the best since the first, lots of implausable over the top  action (CGI), if you look at this movie as fly by the seat of your pants dont think about it too much entertainment you will enjoy.<br />Good simple story line that does enough to keep you interested with a some twists that does not bog the movie down and lets it flow with a few questions about parents off spring and how  well a parent knows their child.<br />Academy Award material its not, now that Bruce Willis has introduced his son he would be wise to only play on the sides of any future actioner and leave the implausible stunts to the next generation if the franchise is to continue.<br />All in all, a solid actioner.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this the best game and I always did like despicible me so when I heard they made a game I was like I have to get this game.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|I love that it holds and doesn't wiggle its way out of the usb port. I would rather use this than what is packaged along with the Kindle Fire.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Everytime I read a Clancy novel I pick up my newspaper with headlines straight from the novel. I read this story about cyber warfare between China and the US during the newspaper headlines about the NSA looking at everyone's email. My Wired magazine had a cover story about the US's cyber warfare office and the use of Stutnex against Iran's nuclear facilities with the response of Iran against Saudi-Aramco and the US financial centers. I am waiting for the shooting war that will follow.
B008RA3X5E|2.0|I thought this would work good as an alarm but it is not the good or easy to use. We decided to use a different one.
B00AB7IA1S|5.0|If You Like Games Like TrainYard, Then You'll Love This Game.  Fun Graphics, You Get To Play With The Camera Angles And Get To Tilt And Rotate The Screen.  Cool 3D GraphicS.  StaRts OfF Pretty Easy But Does Get Tougher.  Very Fun Time Killer.
B004P4S4NM|5.0|I love her voice! She just sends me into another world with songs. I didn't realize she had so many songs that I enjoyed. She is a cross-over artist that identifies with every emotion!
B00B69UQJY|4.0|Seems like the sound of older depeche mode when they got their start. Sill fresh yet retro at same time.
B00136NUG6|5.0|I love hearing the music from back in the day! I find myself blasting the music without intending to-LOL...  It just takes you into another era, which I love!
B007NWCZR4|4.0|A lot of great songs on here. Pet shop boys always delivers, this was a solid album. 4 songs worth it.
1400069807|5.0|Changed my opinion on all processed foods and the mega companies that produce all of this deadly junk.  Have given it to 3 other people to read.
B008B0QH5S|5.0|As good as they get. Liked a lot of the tracks on here. Very solid album all around and worth a listen.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|This game is a lot of fun. Its really cool how you can make your own little reef and learn about the ocean. I thought it would be a game where just little kids would enjoy joy it but I had a bunch of fun with it!
B000FC2KL0|5.0|I've been a RHCP fan for over 20 years now and little did I know... I had no idea how much or how long AK struggled with his additions so needless to say this was an eye opener for me. I really enjoyed reading the chronology of their albums & how they coincided with my own life.<br />Highly recommended read!!!
B000JCQCW4|2.0|Usually when I see a show that has been described as \\"gritty\\" it mmeans it will be about characters who have pretty  much only negative trauts in a story where they pretty much only prove themselves to be worse than the original crappy characterization showed them to be.<br /><br />This movie was no exception.<br /><br />If you are looking for a movie about people you would mostly rather feed into a woodchipper than watch inteact this is for you
B008NW1M4K|5.0|hilarious. i hope it will be translated at one point to english, for everybody not being fit in german!!!!!<br />it will poss. will get slaughtered while doing so. some of the stuff is just not translatable!<br />so, learn german LOL. beats everything i have read in a while!
0345803507|5.0|Love the last of the 3 books just as I loved the first two.  This one is more &#34;laid back&#34; as family is growing and they are settling into a full-blown relationship.  I could read another 1-2 books as the family and businesses develop.  Can't wait for the movie to be out -- but I KNOW it won't be as exciting as the books are.......or it will be XXXX rated!:)
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I'm totally in love with this couple. Can't wait until the next one comes out. Please Sylvia Day....hurry :) :)
B003QTWR08|5.0|This an enchanting movie and speaks subtly to our choices and throw away society.  And unlike Disney, there's no death or violence.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Can't get enough of Gideon. Can't wait to jump into the next book!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I love the steamy romance scenes and the HOT SEX!
159463176X|3.0|The plot was hard to follow through out the middle of the book with so many characters, flashbacks, etc.  The ending did pull the story together well though. I would advise another reader to keep a flow chart of characters to help keep track of the many characters.
B00846REIS|5.0|After having just read the 50 Shades series, wasn't sure how this was going to compare. I'm glad I read it. The sex was just as hot and steamy, but a different spin on the characters. loved it!!
B00C33M2EE|5.0|This is absolutely awesome. Suitable for all ages, for music listeners of all genres, for any occasions! Everyone would love this :)
B00D37UQ1K|5.0|Excellent actresses and actors, stayed true to the book. I love Saoirse Ronan in just about everything she does and the guys who played the love interests were both hotties! Also the chemistry between both &#34;couples&#34; was very believable.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Lots of fun. I like the mental challenge of looking for all the clues. Having the multiple screens are my favorite.
0425263916|5.0|I REALLY ENJOYED THIS SERIES AND WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO ALL US EROTIC BOOK LOVERS.  COULDNT PUT IT DOWN AND DID NOT WANT IT TO END.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I planned my wedding, decorated my home, and became a decent cook using ideas on pinterest. It's a fantastic app.
B000FCK65W|5.0|Book had a nostalgic story line.  I couldn't put it down.  I recommend it to everyone.  What more could I say.
B0083EY9EI|5.0|Emeli Sande is one of the best artists out there. Actual music I can listen to and enjoy over and over again.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|Entertaining, good game, but runs slow on occasion on my 1st gen Kindle Fire. Would still recommend as it is free.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I choose this because of my grandaugther and she just loves playing this game.  I have to limit the time she plays the game because if not she would play for hours.
B00881VLCE|1.0|I loved the old version of this<br /> This new update sucks it doesn't work right there is bad lag when you move the pieces and they are really small the old one was so much better please fix this. I will not continue to use and buy puzzles if it stays the same and I have ordered two puzzle packs that never came and I tried to contact the company with no luck this update wad the last straw. PLEASE FIX!!
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|This game was fun to play and had me thinking all the time as to how I should positoin the little things to shoot.  Very good game to play.
B0007LXPBI|4.0|I bought this because my twin granddaughters ( age 11 1/2) are getting ready to go to camp this summer.<br />It was perfect for them.  They really related to the age and loved the funny parts.<br />Good movie for kids...and grandparents.
B00CM9JKQM|5.0|Every album since Promised Land was one boring piece of crap followed by another boring piece of crap. Just when I thought Queensryche was washed up, they come out with an album that's comparable to any one of their classic albums. Todd La Torre sounds as great on vocals as Geoff Tate sounded in his prime. It's hard to believe that Geoff Tate passed on these songs.<br /><br />This is a must have for any fan of classic Queensryche. The music is classic Queensryche.<br /><br />Geoff Tate, you suck, hang it up. You haven't been able to write a descent song since Chris Degarmo left. Your new album is another boring piece of crap, and your phony version of Queensryche will fade away before you know it. Your washed up and I can't wait to see your face when Queensryche reclaims their past glory.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|like it a lot. can't stop playing.  have to use your brain to work your way out of the room!
B00BWJ7LYG|4.0|a wonderful story that transfers to the screen well.  Still one of my favorite tales of middle earth and bygone times.
B004UID2LC|5.0|um this app is AWESOME the only thing is it will shut down only 1 time then just get right back on so GET THIS APP
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I just started watching this TV show in rerun status.  I got hooked after the first season.  I never have bought a TV series but loved the show so much I had to buy all 3 seasons!  Season 3 so far is my favorite!!!
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|Enjoyed his movie very much. Denzel's ability to characterize emotional states facially really shows in this role. The subtle build up of the lead characters angst throughout the film is very well acted & produced. Personally responsibility is a value we don't see enough of in our current cultural state. Recommended for viewing & discussing with family.
B00CL50KDY|5.0|Lots of laughs! Great story! Had me laughing and entranced with what would happen next. A great movie for zombie lovers!
B009AMANBA|5.0|I can't write a review on this book due to the fact that the book was a gift. However, the feed back from the gift recipient was positive.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I'm always bord with all my other games. I always beat them so easy but this one I always have a new thing to do
B00B7Y0206|1.0|Just downloaded it, it doesn't work..... it uploaded all of my YouTube info, but it won't play video do for some reason.
B004ADH1RI|5.0|This is our time.  The theme resonates throughout the movie and makes you proud to be part of that age group.
B007L3BMGA|4.0|It is a woman's book and very detailed. Enjoyed reading it during the evening mostly. Very sensual and recommend it to all women.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I think coin dozer is a really fun game about math and strategies. Also coin dozer works people's mind out.
B0053O8AQE|5.0|I was surprised at how great this show is. Well written, great one liners, amazing cast! This show reminds me of Two and a half men's humor! This show will be around for a long time,, I know it! I bought it on DVD the same day it was released,,, and watched it countless times. Well worth the purchase. Can't wait to get season #2. LOVE IT~
B001L51RQE|3.0|The Police were always a high energy group in the 80's. I think they could have used a few Energizer Ever Ready Bunny batteries before they went on  stage. Watched it once, and will probably donate it to my local library.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|If you like puzzles you'll love this game. It took a few minutes to figure out what to do, but that was part of the fun. I wish there were more rooms, as I finished in two sittings. (Or maybe I'm just that good!)
0062238868|5.0|This was a well written bookthat told one mans story without glorifing him. It showed the human side of one solder and his struggles and accomplishments!
B00DC7N9NS|3.0|If you are a fan of family guy you may have a problem getting past Mila Kunis playing the roll of the Wicked Witch...all you hear is MEG!!!
B000JMKQX0|5.0|This book is written like a war journal.  It is very realistic considering there are zombies.  There is also deep co consideration for the many facets of war.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Easy to navigate. I use it when doing my Bible study lesson.  Easy to hop from one area to another.
B003BW0CB6|5.0|I love the Lincoln Lawyer series. Wish there were more. But then again, I love all of Michael Connelly's books. I'm never disappointed. Always wondering, right up to the end. Don't hesitate to buy
B009CF7GRY|3.0|It's was OK...good for a Saturday afternoon movie.  LOVED the original movie though I think more for the actors in it.
B0047Y17P2|5.0|I was so glad another book in this series came out. Can't get enough. I wish I just found this series so I could be just beginning to read them. Connelly can't write the fast enough.
B00B5HQKNI|3.0|so lets see, the movie opens and it has a scene about that computer drive and that chase scene which was very similar to the one of taken2... well its a small world after all...<br />and after a few obvious car product placement, a train scene where the train will not stop eventhough the carrage is destroyed, bond is shot and falls off a bridge. we all know he survives, and this moment felt a bit like the nuke in indiana jones4<br />i mean come on a gunshot+fall off a bridge at a high speed (momentum would tell us he would hit the other side of the river before he would hit the water, but this is a nitpick)+falling flat on his back+waterfall+adelle should = to a dead bond but no. one does not simply kill 007<br />he just reapears, then finds out that a hack caused mi6 to blow up... (not even remotely possible) which leads bond to go on an almost wild goose chase that is somehow known. so after 1hour or so we finally see the villain(cyanide is not an acid BTW)<br />and after a plan that is impossible to happen, silvia escapes and tries to kill M but fails so they hide in scotland...<br />why scotland, where if they are found, they are sitting ducks.<br /><br />the gadgets are very weak, a radio and a gun... when q talked about the exploding pen i said yeah why nt bring that aesome gadget back. i mean enemy of the state had better gadgets. even stormbreaker had better gadgets than a gun and a tracking device. also a 40 year old british car that was rotting inn a garage wouldn never start.<br /><br />after a scene rip off from home alone...  really? home alone? couldn't rip off something a little less noticeable?<br />M is killed which was a surprise to be honest<br />and so was silvia the end.<br /><br />the only person i was sad to see die was the car from goldfinger.<br /><br />also, near the end of this movie, it seemed that bond was just in the way of silvia's attempt to kill M, which made bond more of a bodyguard and less of a secret agent<br /><br />one thing iwondered... what happened to that hard drive bond died for, wasn't that the whole reason he left for his mission?
B006LSZECO|5.0|I loved the amazing twists and turns in this novel.  I didn't figure out the mystery before the end and that makes it all the better.  Some people complained about the language.  I didn't even notice it because it was so well in character.
0061367036|4.0|This book did have a good amount of the supernatural monsters, and information on them which I enjoyed, but I thought it should read more like an encyclopedia. I did not like that the book was formatting as if someone was talking to you. Its just weird to read
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I hate the format of the new update.  The map takes longer to load and is harder to read.  I'll be removing this app and looking for a different weather app.
0765365278|4.0|Just finished it and it was a wonderful experience and I'm looking forward to more of the series. That being said it's not without it's flaws:<br />*Spoilers*<br />- The book is a long read and it runs into the problem of becoming slow and a possible chore for some readers although the ending does make up for it. For many parts of the book until the end, I kept asking myself what's the point, you know the overarching plot that connects all the characters and it wasn't until the end of the book that I finally \\"got it\\".<br /><br />- The book has an interesting caste system where people are judged based on their eye color and it works until every other sentence has a \\"light-eyed officer walked up\\" or a \\"group of dark-eyed men were carrying shields\\", my point is after a while it gets annoying that every character or scene with people must have their eye color stated, it just got a bit annoying to read. This is just a minor issue and doesn't really take away from the book.<br /><br />-This one is just my opinion but I think some of the divisions between men and women in the book are somewhat ridiculous. They have \\"men's\\" and \\"women's\\" food in the book and that stretches kinda far in my opinion. I understand suspending your disbelief, but come on. It's not like I'm part of the feminist brigade or anything, but it just stuck out, especially after reading writers like GRRM that do a good job of writing from the female perspective (or so my female friends say).<br /><br />-As far as character development go Sanderson's best developed character is Kaladin, but that might because we got to see flashbacks of his life and no other character got that benefit. I looked forward to reading from his POV the most, that couldn't be said for Dalinar or Shallan( I did love her later chapters).<br /><br />- The interludes besides Szeth's didn't add much to the story on my initial reading, but maybe I'll see something's I missed on a reread.<br /><br />Overall, the The Way of Kings is a great entry novel (you'll notice most of my issues with the book were minor) for a The Stormlight archives which promises to be a great epic fantasy and a must read for fantasy buffs.eat entry novel (you'll notice most of my issues with the book were minor) for a The Stormlight archives which promises to be a great epic fantasy and a must read for fantasy buffs.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|Hot book, just needed more going on in the background. Good sex, but lacked a real story line to it. I just finished it and I'm not sure if I can even tell you the climax of the story... Plus, I have no idea where it was going at the end. This could be a good thing though. Still, I'll read the next one bc I love this couple and their messed upness.
B002KCO6QA|3.0|I like this movie but didn't realize that it was from the UK..and that I couldn't play it on my DVD players or Xbox....it'll be too much work to return it so I think I'm just gonna buy an all region DVD player :/
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I really enjoyed this story, though I wouldn't think it would be for everybody. I liked the characters; I've known people like them, so they were very believable to me.
B000DWMN2S|5.0|I absolutely love this movie so I was super happy when I got it. Highly recommend this movie. Its great.
B0061S073A|4.0|I am able to trust his independent play without worrying he will get frustrated with things beyond his skill set.
B00BFUUMO8|1.0|I thought this game was fab, worked on it every day and really enjoyed it. ThAt was until the last update and everything got lost! App is now binned as totally lost everything I had patiently built. FAntastic update guys with no support :-([[ASIN:B00BFUUMO8 Jurassic Park(TM) Builder]]
B00932A66Y|4.0|Fortunately this movie follows the book quite well otherwise it might have been harder to follow and still read the subtitles.  The acting was good and the realism of the outhouse and crash scenes was great.
B00DEG4Z1W|5.0|Very interactive for child 7 - 10 years.  Visuals very effective with many options.  Easy to operate and no instructions required.
B00CO8D3G4|4.0|James Altucher's book is not going to sit well with some who think that it is a dog eat dog world but he has succeeded because he chooses to give great value and do what is right by him.
B00364K6YW|5.0|I think the restored edition is perfect. Since I received the movie, I have watched the movie numerous times. Perfect
B00AOCLWF6|4.0|The show is exciting to get into, if a little predictable. The acting is good and the script is well written. Fun little science fiction survival situation.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I was looking for a solitaire app that would allow me to kill a few minutes every day while just relaxing. This app delivers exactly that. The game is visually well-designed, and the controls are very simple. You can customize some of the simple variations of classic solitaire with an easy-to-use menu. If you want to play lots of solitaire without needles frills, this app is for you.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|The first few levels were lots of fun however I cannot do the scene with the automobile.  I can't find the last teapot and have no idea what the pyramid code is all about so I quit playing.  Sad because it really was fun.
020530902X|5.0|Really helpful when high quality written are required. The examples are very useful. I carry it in my bag all the time.
B000Y0Q5NM|5.0|At first this started off a little slow. I wondered why they made so many seasons.<br />But boy did I get hooked. Story lines were over all excellent. You really get involved in the characters relationships with one another. Nothing can compare to Star Trek series and movies, but StarGate Universe is up there in my opinion.
B0090KZDSK|5.0|Loved it!  Gideon & Eva's relationship is tested once again and made stronger. Sylvia Days books keep you captivated right to the end and leave you wanting more.
B0053O89WY|5.0|Love a series that I can watch time and time again and find myself laughing time and time again. Strongly recommend.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|I'd recommend it to any adult or any parent, a great way to look at loving being you and allowing your child to be themselves as well.
B00000099Y|5.0|Great album, great band, great musicianship that really shows in every single track. I just had to have this album to add to my collection. Recommend for anyone looking for a great experience.
B009NY43NY|5.0|Great ending to a fun series ... Loved the closure at the end. All of my favorite characters revisit the story line to make a wonderful ending.
B00005B36H|5.0|Great album, great band, great musicianship that really shows in every single track. I just had to have this album to add to my collection. Recommend for anyone looking for a great experience.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I found it difficult to keep up with all the characters as it jumped around from one to the other. Felt a little disconnected until later in the chapter.
B000000993|5.0|Great album, great band, great musicianship that really shows in every single track. I just had to have this album to add to my collection. Recommend for anyone looking for a great experience.
B003JBI2KM|5.0|IMHO the bible for anyone who wants to start or improve their knowledge in home brewing. Have been recommending it to everyone I know who home brews.
B000EULJLU|5.0|Great album, great band, great musicianship that really shows in every track. I just had to have this album to add to my collection. Recommend for anyone looking for a great experience.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|Lots of fun keeps you wanting to play more.  Love it and will recommend to my friends.  Good job glu.
B002361MLA|5.0|Referred by a friend. I  finally understand the concept of the power of now. Living in the past and future no . More
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I will say this one wasn't as good as the first two & it once again leaves you with a cliffhanger! But it was still fabulous & more to the story of Eva & Gideon. It is more predictable in what is going to happen, but also less volatile. As if you could love Gideon Cross more, you will fall further in love with the man.<br /><br />Highly recommended!
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|Yes This Is The Best Strategy Game.<br />What Else I Should Say.<br />It Have Good Graphics.<br />Its The Most Fun And Challenge Defensive Game.
B001NA6096|4.0|Uplifting and touching. I needed a little romance and this did it. Nice to watch a movie where nothing is exploding or being tortured.
B00CF34B2I|1.0|I'm downloading it now..it's at 100% and won't go any further.. it's been 5hours. It's been a week of downloading it always get a caution at the end.. not worth downloading
B001N9ESQ4|4.0|Had just watched Before Sunrise so of course I needed to watch Before Sunset to see what happened. Nice, slow pace. No gimmicks just human dialogue.
B00A8ECU24|1.0|I downloaded this app twice but it would never let me play.  It downloaded completely then turned to a white screen.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|No excessive waiting. lots of fun and lots of options! Can spend a few minutes playing or hours! Totally enjoyable!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I honestly couldn't put this book down. I read it in two days. I have to thank Amazon prime free book club. I doubt that I would have bought this. It turns out that I 'll buy the rest of the series. It's a don't miss
B009LGO88E|4.0|I basically got this for Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate. Works great, would never play it without it, but its hardly portable, and I wish Nintendo would just release an updated 3ds with a second analog. Oh well.
0547564651|4.0|From birth through college, Tough combines a thorough review of the research with on-point interviews and visits with programs and staff who try to change the trajectory for high-risk children. He also captures the voices of the children themselves. It's a bit uneven in how it approaches topics and parts are too long (I do not ever want to hear another word about middle school chess). However, as a policy advocate for low-income children, I'd consider this a great introduction to what we know and what can be done in your community.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|This app is the best picture editing app ever!! I highly recommend it! You can do so much with it!! Love it soo much!!! It has plenty effects and collage layouts! Must get this app!!
B001NA6096|4.0|interesting characters and dialogue, believable plot; not bad insight into the inner workings of the female mind;  Delpy is lucious
B0056BMK6K|5.0|Great read for up and coming authors or even the author that hasn't written a sentence yet.  The book makes you feel empowered and inspired while keeping your feet planted firmly on the ground.  Recommend!
B001N9ESQ4|4.0|Nine years is a long time after which to rekindle a brief romance, but these two are definitely good for each other.  Looking forward to the next reunion.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Very handy app!!!!!!!!!! I love the style. Just wish they had more options to choose from but for the price it was good. :)
0385535147|5.0|John Grisham's books never disappoint.  This one is excellent with an intricate plot that keeps you guessing until the end.
B00CLZ48FA|5.0|I enjoyed this movie. Story line was a great version of the original classic. Also the ending of the movie was amazing.
B00BMUVW5O|5.0|Inspiring as the first book. Much better than fiction. I NEED Bob to come teach my three cats how to high five because I'm sure not having any success with that. Thanks for sharing your rewarding story with us!
B008K9UZY4|5.0|I played it on the GameCube and now the kindle fire. I would recommend it if u want to play this game
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Game was challenging and enjoyable. Looking forward to more levels. There are a lot of puzzles and you get to use your imagination.
B00D23GXB2|4.0|With vibrant prose, erotic sensuality  and  a  mouth-watering  delight  on  every  page ,  I  have  to  say  this  poet  left  me  wanting  more. The  poems  to  the  eyes were  like  graceful  music  to  the  ears.  Full  of  heart  pounding  ,  desirable  and  tasteful  treats  that  I  could  not  get  enough  of.  My  only  regret  is  that  this  book  was  not  a  little  longer.  This  would be  a  perfect  gift  for  newlyweds,  lovers  or  anyone  who  has  a  taste  for  fine  art.  This  collection  of  poems is  a  work  of  an  artist.  I  hope  to  see  many  more  from  this  author.  The  book  was  simply  in  a  word..\\"  Sizzling!\\"
B009UZBLSG|2.0|It works fine but you are warned  to handle with strongly care. The cable is totally inflexible. It will be broken up by minimum twisting. This is my second SlimPort and I thing is already on way to be broken. (I've been using it for 2 weeks).<br />If I could, I would suggest to the manufacturer to make the cable flexible or even totally rigid to avoid this failure.
B0064J6OMO|3.0|Too many boob shots for my taste, some tasteless humor on top of that. I wish I could say it was better, I was really disappointed.
0785168109|5.0|Bought for 10 year old son who loves it!  And as for mom..I had no idea about all the different iron man suits out there.  Very interesting and descriptive!
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|Many of my knitting buddies are Dr. Who fans, and now I know why.  I haven't yet completed Season 1, but Christopher Eccleston, the ninth Doctor, is my favorite.
B0097C8XL0|5.0|This game is very addictive. Passes time and cute even for kids. Wish some things weren't as expensive but keeps you playing to get what you want.
B002WV5A9G|3.0|In my opinion Kirk character is less than likeable.  Young Spock is great, and having Leonard Nimoy adds to movie greatly.  Not the best Star Trek movie I have seen, but definitely needed as part of the whole series.
B005K17RU0|3.0|Too much info on the screen. If you could customize your page to show only the info you wanted, (ie maps, current conditions, hourly forecast, and weekly forecast), then the screen would be much easier to navigate and would focus solely on the individuals needs from the app, while eliminating all unnecessary info. (ie temp trends, videos, daily temp graph etc)
B0011Z32KI|4.0|Michael always comes across strong, and his voice is always pleasant to listen to. I will buy more of his albums.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|I LOVED the old version. The update, which is automatically done-blah- is BAD. I don't like the look, it's more difficult to navigate, and the map function freezes and shuts down my Kindle Fire EVERY time I use it. Already deleted it and downloaded a different one. :(
B00COGY2P2|3.0|Cruise is a great actor, but if you are a fan of Lee Child, then you know Cruise does not fit the bill.  Cruise did a good job acting, but I just can't get a handle on him playing this part. Movie is good adaptation of one of the better Reacher novels, but really needs a hero like the &#34;old&#34; Schwarzeneger actor, big and brute type.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I love that each floor is a small puzzle but I don't like that it doesn't have your work if you have to leave the app.
B00BETX5PS|5.0|Daniel Craig is great.  Ending sad, but an excellent way to phase out Judi Densch since she can no longer make movies. I look forward to the new &#34;M&#34; with Ralph Fiennes.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|really enjoyed this game had to keep on playing. to see what would. happen next, played great on my kindle, no problems.
B00CS74W0C|5.0|this book has a great plot! I am not normally a reader but these book held my interest and I had trouble putting the book down!
B00CISAPJS|4.0|This is one we will watch many times...especially with the grandkids.  Bought the online version as it is easy to find and no scratches. Lol
B009VIZDLI|5.0|Thought this was a great book. Yes, the out o e is as expected but I found myself warming to the characters and really enjoying the read
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|I hope you have lots of free time when you start watching this show. It is nearly impossible to watch one episode and it not turn into watching 5. Can not wait for Season 3 to start July 16!
0451232852|5.0|A strong beginning for the trilogy - will be interesting to see if the story can maintain for another 2000 pages!
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|very good watch just need to make sure 100 percent that you know it is a fiction movie that all kids know this before watching
0451418441|4.0|Follet's sojourn into medieval times provides authenticity and a good story line.  Not quite as good as &#34;Pillars of the Earth&#34; but an enjoyable read.
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|the movie is great for kids boys exspecialy.  they also have a sequal part two out now. Its worth the rent
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is great. So far Paris has been my favorite update. I definitely give this five stars. I recommend this to everybody.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|I thought the first two seasons were excellent and would give them each 5 stars, but this season had some okay moments, good moments, and excellent moments. I know plenty who would disagree with me, but I just thought it was as consistently good as the first two seasons where I was glued.
B00466H3DG|4.0|The film is a great love story(or lack there of?) with Jim Carrey actually acting as someone else.  The style is one that I rarely see in movies from a calming rain scene to dream like scene transitions, it is absolutely beautiful.  However like other people have said the blu ray I ordered lacked any bonus content despite the page description saying otherwise but if you just want to see this masterpiece in the best video/sound quality possible definitely recommend this version.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|Cannot access ebay at work so i installed this apk on my android phone. Now I don't have to worry about being blocked at work for ebay access
B001K3EXTA|4.0|I loved it once it got going. It was a real tease waiting for about 30 minutes movie time to finally have Robert Redford show up on screen. I guess that was the intended affect LOL. Redford played Gatsby brilliantly--meaning a rich tycoon by questionable means still trapped in his now awkward first boyhood crush. At first I thought Mia Farrow's acting was a bit fakey, but as the movie progressed I realized she was acting exactly as the Daisy she portrayed--shallow, hopelessly immature, affected, selling her soul to the highest bidder.  If you can be patient enough to wait for Redford's grand entrance, and if you can roll with the idiosyncracies of that era, you're good to go!
B000002JSR|2.0|It amazes me that anyone has given this 4 or 5 stars. These are leftovers.  I can't quit you baby is the only song of note. As I said this is for collectors.
B001VQB25E|5.0|I have owned these over 6 months and wear at least once a week. These are very comfortable and fit well (150-180lbs). They are also durable showing no signs of wear and good in warm weather. I use these on my long rides (3-4hrs) because of the comfort.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|I love how the show plays with historical fiction. I wish my kids could watch the great story line progression and fine acting. They are huge fans of Lord of the Rings..  BUT the sex scenes are too explicit (and way too many.. that's my only complaint).
B0000AMRJD|4.0|Bought for my adult son!  He really loves it watches it all the time.  Can't get enough of it.  Excellent
B000ICZD5M|1.0|Didn't love the movie. I've heard the books are better and the author even wanted to disown this movie. Seriously not good!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Fun game that's easy to learn and each puzzle takes no time s ok you can do it whenever yo want to waste a minute or two
0783226063|1.0|This version is not, repeat NOT, 'widescreen'.<br /><br />It's letterbox.<br /><br />When someone comes out with a truly widescreen version, I'd like to know about it.
B004GYY714|5.0|This is wonderful for finding the music you love and want to hear from anywhere in the country.  I have such varied taste in music, no one radio station can do it but this meets all my needs.
B00A7YZ1KI|1.0|I am not really sure what to say. This book was HORRID! I enjoyed the series but really this book seems like it was thrown together in a few hours with no real thought to plot
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Loved this game, very fun to play.  Keeps you wanting to play more and find one more clue! Can't wait for more levels.
B00BSBY38A|2.0|The cinematography was amazing and mind-blowing.  The story was actually trivial at some points and not great when it was all over.
B008K8U13K|4.0|Sonic 4 Episode 1 is byfar one of my favorite games to play on my Kindle Fire!...Except for one issue, there's something wrong with the sound effects! The SEGA chant, the rings, they're all oddly distorted in this port! Other than that, the game is great Sonic fun! SEGA, just fix these weird SFX please!
B002JXK5VU|5.0|Started watching this show a few weeks ago.  I can't seem to put down my Kindle when I am watching it.  Great concept of a town full of geniuses, great cast, and great near-doom plots.  I recommend to watch if you enjoy syfy.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|What a disappointment, waiting months for this and then to have a non-conclusive, poorly written book was infuriating,  Too bad there's not a money back guarantee if readers are not satisfied.
0141301066|4.0|Matilda is a genius. Before she even enters school, she's able to read and do mathematics. Her family is not impressed. They don't value books and believe Matilda is impertinent when she voices her thoughts. The five-year-old impresses her first teacher, Miss Honey, who rallies for Matilda but is ignored by the parents and school administration. Most grownups don't want to believe in Matilda's giftedness.<br /><br />The whole class loves Miss Honey, but they're all terrified of Headmistress Trunchbull. She is one mean, violent woman who loathes all children. Matilda has played clever pranks on her family, and now it's time to get back at Miss Trunchbull by using her brains and some newfound magical abilities.<br /><br />This book is full of many extremes. Matilda is immensely intelligent, Trunchbull is ridiculously cruel, and so on. This would bother me in other books, but the author blended everything so nicely that I didn't mind. Like Dahl's other works for children, this is humorous and has a main character readers will adore.
B00CW665VI|5.0|Loved this book, the writing was just so engaging.  Difficult to put down, leave you wanting to know more. Highly recomend.
0345803507|5.0|Quick Ship - goods as represented online - plan to share with friends then keep for myself.<br />The series was very interesting and raised many questions in my mind.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is the best game ever and you should buy it on your device I love it and you will to
0345803493|5.0|Quick ship - enjoyed the book immensely.  Received as represented in ad - plan to share with friends, then keep for myself to re-read.
B00C7TAF3Y|1.0|I was going through the tutorial not once, but actually started over about 5 times. It told me nothing. I'm not really good at these games, but to be stuck at the beginning is downright stupid. I wish I could delete it from my Kindle. It sucks
B00BUAEYVK|3.0|I had enjoyed all of the other movies in this series but this one was lacking something that the other movies had.  I can't quite put my finger on it.  Fast paced but still did not care for this movie in the series.
B000KUD2G4|5.0|This solved a difficult hum problem without reducing the voice quality of our pastor's sermons while doing digital recordings. I highly recommend it.
B000TEUSJK|3.0|My son wanted this for his movie collection, and told me it about it. And I thought I had seen most movies, I was wrong. My son likes this movie, and is happy.
B00333IA1M|3.0|Awesome book, one of my favorites, but the picture and headline said a vintage copy. Got the plain newer version. Was disappointed.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This app is awesome! You will love it too! Its kind of like subway surfers. Its my favorite app right now! Please get this app, its awesome!
B0092SQ5EG|5.0|Great inspirational movie that is clean enough for the entire family to watch.  It is amazing to see how such a talented person could have failed had she not been self motivated.
B00C7JGDBW|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie. I thought it was really a great story of how Oz became Oz. I recommend anyone that loves the original Wizard of Oz movie to see this. Very enjoyable.
B008Y2FRFO|2.0|The game is very slow<br />When you have used the coins you have to wait for more or buy more
B00C7NKPPS|5.0|I have always been a fan of Paul McCartney and Wings. I just love his music. All the songs on this cd are fantastic. I recommend it to any fan of Paul McCartney and Wings.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Enjoyed this app,, one of the better Ive seen. Wish it was longer, hope for a update soon.  I would like to see the next levels, this is fun.
B009NQZVKG|5.0|Stumbled onto the Sigma Force series a few months ago. Got hooked right away with the diverse plots and characters. This is the best yet, providing dome satisfying closure to dome dub-plots and intriguing twists yo be resolved in the next book.
B009NQZVKG|5.0|James Rollins at his best!  This book holds your interest from start to finish while enhancing his characters from previous Sigma series books and introducing new ones.  Makes you eager for the next one.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I have always love My Little Pony when I was a kid and still do... Now my daughter love them also... We can play the game together... Thank you...
B00D37UP4S|3.0|Just not enough story and substance. Movie could have really took off with the concepts & beautiful scenery in the canyon.  Movie just didn't seem to fill what I expected.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great story. Not sure if I want to see the movie or not. Definitely need to read the next book.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Watched it 3 times in 24 hours. Was better each time! So well done I checked out producer and director and studio.
B00DHNJ0I0|3.0|Movie contains a very predictable and overused plot. The action scenes are decent but most very unbelievable 1 guy fighting 20 and not getting a scratch. Overall was a decent rent, wouldn't buy it
0240815807|5.0|Mixing Secrets has forever changed the way I look at mixing and has dramatically improved my performance on all aspects of the mixing process. I will always keep this one by my side in the studio !
B009CG29RK|5.0|One of the best movies I've ever seen!!! Worth watching again and again!! And it's great for any age group. :)
B005544TRQ|5.0|Great characters and an awesome storyline. Whitty, charming and sexy.  Gabriel macht is great and newcomer Patrick Adams is funny.
B0091WAWTM|5.0|Great movie regarding the beginnings of genetic modifications of plants and the mental results of those who tend to the plants.<br />It will burn you up to watch this.
B000UZQI0Q|3.0|As the title says, it is good enough and fast paced enough for me to read the third and last book of the series.
B000SGSU58|5.0|I picked up on the Harry Bosch series about five years ago and have been going back every once in a while to read the classics. While the character has changed a lot over time he has pretty much stayed the same. Smart, gritty, and human.
B0010SKUYM|4.0|I have read many fantasy series, and this one is starting to grow on me. To be honest a few chapters in I was thinking WFT?! Many readers love Rothfuss as a new, up and coming writer, but the first few chapters seemed clunking and going nowhere. Then we are told this is really about a story told within the story. Really? Okay, so I decided to read a bit more to give it a chance. And I ended up finishing and quickly reading the second book. I ended up liking the University scenes more than I thought (I am well-educated educated adult, so I don't go in for the Hogwarts sort of hokus pokus). Some of Kovothe's adventures get tedious, put the plot generally moves along and the world building is tight. Characters are mostly well developed, though not at all in George Martin's league. When the third book comes out, I will certainly get it, though not at hardcover prices.
B00AVFO41K|2.0|I downloaded this game and decided I didn't like it. I came back to the appstore to write a &quot;don't bother&quot; type review, and the appstore wouldn't stay open longer than twenty seconds. I turned my Kindle off and restarted; nothing I did would work. No matter what app I was looking at at the time, the appstore force closed after a few seconds. I couldn't resolve the issue until I deleted this game from my library AND the cloud. Since then, I've had no more problems.<br /><br />I don't know if this will happen to you, but I will not give this developer a shot at any more of my money. I also think that Amazon should be ashamed for allowing such shoddy apps as the FAOTD lately. Spyware, malicious programs and permissions, and sub par developers are making it hard for me to trust anything Amazon is offering.<br /><br />Please, Amazon, fix this mess before you lose your paying customers.
B002LC8HF0|4.0|In general I like the Mistborn series a lot. It is very good fantasy writing, though I think Sanderson's new series the Stormlight Archive is better. In fact I read the first Stormlight before Mistborn. The fantasy magic/world building aspect is the best part, characters are okay, and relationships between characters are probably the week point.<br /><br />I thought this last book ran out of steam at the end, put there seemed really no place to go by the end...all the major issues were resolved. There is another book taking place 300 years after this one, and I think I will skip it in favor of finding new authors to explore.
B00785P2QC|3.0|Not as good as sim city but considering its free I can't complain. I won't buy credits on games like look e this so it takes a while to do anything.

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Love it!!!  The minions are so funny and the game is great.. my 3 year old is obsessed with this game
B00BZW5W3W|5.0|I can be considered one of many who have loved Maysa since her beginnings with Incognito put her on the map.  Along with her Incognito work, I've enjoyed many of her solo recordings.  With this new CD, &#34;Blue Velvet Soul&#34; Maysa has achieved a wonderful listening experience and simply her finest CD to date!  This is one of those rare CDs that has no weak songs on it, so I'll just make note of my favorites:<br /><br />Be There, What Can I Do, When Your Soul Answers (#1 for me), Inside My Dream, Quiet Fire, Love Me Good<br /><br />I encourage all lovers of real singing and real music to purchase this wonderful CD and elevate her to the level of recognition that artists of her caliber deserve!
B004LWZW2E|5.0|If you like movies such as \\"The Shining\\" or \\"The Ring\\", then Insidious is most likely for you.<br /><br />Don't let the message on the dvd box \\"From the directors of paranormal activity\\" fool you as paranormal activity was not scary at all and is nothing like Insidious. Insidious isn't no teenager/young adult slasher film, it's true horror film with realistic normal people. The movie is straight up weird in a creepy way.<br /><br />The spirits/figures appear in the weirdest parts in rooms at the least expected time in the movie. Some things can be seen in the background where most of the audience won't see until they watch it for the second time. Good/different storyline along the way. It isn't a typical ghost movie, it is something deeper than that.<br /><br />What helps this movie become creepier is the music. It has a feel of a old school horror film. Good horror flick.
B00C81AVNU|4.0|Kinky Boots is the current runaway hit on Broadway that won 6 Tonys, including best musical score and first Tony for the iconic Cyndi Lauper.  She wrote excellent music for this show and the lyrics clearly help to carry the story.  I look forward to experiencing the whole production in the near future.<br /><br />It's interesting to be able to identify the Cyndi Lauper sound in all of the material.  The music is highlighted by the show's co-stars, Stark Sands and the Tony Award winning Billy Porter.  Out of all the excellent material, the song I find to be the highlight of the soundtrack is the incredibly powerful and emotional &#34;Not My Father's Son&#34;.  The entire soundtrack is an uplifting listening experience and I recommend it highly.
B00594XOZU|4.0|Hi i had kik for  a long time&amp;&amp;when i had a group chat it said kik app stopped working what do i do? Other than that great app c: kiki me at Raylene__3
B0055G9L9U|4.0|These guys are just funny. Not for children that you don't want exposed to swearing. Homage to Men in Black, Dragnet, Bond and CosmoCon.
B00ACBN9CI|2.0|The game seems nice but I can't do anything before I just spin around and loose total control I can't shoot  becuz it's just that stupid controlling stuff, there should have just been buttons instead of moving the device so I give it 2 stars for looks and the realism in planes
B00B5HQL50|5.0|Not many gadgets (emphasized in the movie dialog).  Spoiler: new Q. If you like explosions and burning buildings, you will like this.
B00785P2QC|4.0|I like the game cause i like building stuff and making citys (i am a girl) but one thing i dont like is th a t it keeps have missions like like us on Facebook or anything Facebook, it is a game for kids for gosh saicks.
B00CLVEPFC|3.0|acting was stiff. Fairy tale but really, those weapons? Seemed as though parts of the movie were cut out. The visual effects were good.
B00CO52NLI|3.0|Well I didn't like that you have to buy the other levels<br />at all, and you do the same thing over and over again.
B004BEMC6G|5.0|Lots of action.  Unexpected plot.  If you purchase and download Salt from Instant Video, you will get a different ending than if you stream it. Even when Jolie is battered and bruised and bleeding, she is still eye candy.
B009O2XY12|5.0|I love this game! It's so fun!<br />And i love at the end of a<br />level the little squirrel thing hugs the minnie<br />squirrel thing! It's just so cute!!
B004Q3UL56|5.0|Love is everything. Winning the market becoming CEO cannot compare to our love one. I would recommend this movie for biz men.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love to play Minecraft.I love to spawn animals .I like to do<br />Survival and creative.It's so fun and common.
0061900656|4.0|We're preparing my two-year-old son for the birth of a sibling and he has really enjoyed this book. We'll see if it helps in 4 weeks!  :)
B00BOXZAG6|5.0|If you are in the mood for &#34;once upon a time in a kingdom...&#34;  Then you have found the right romantic movie.  If you are out to be a plothole and physics critique then avoid this film.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I loved this game it passed time and is good for children chains long car rides I think it's a must get game
B0019LY5IM|4.0|Okay, so I stayed on this through the whole ride and was mostly satisfied, even during the frustrating parts. If you have gone through the first four seasons... keep going.
B000LB7G00|4.0|I am using ZW3D at home and this works really good. It improves modeling speed and it is much comfortable than using mouse alone.<br />In the office, I use a different 3D CAD called Caelum Xxen. I use this software almost 4 hours a day but unfortunately it does not support 3D mouse.<br />Be sure to check your CAD vendor if they support 3D mouse.
B00008G1KJ|5.0|A double album on 2 CDs (at least in what I bought), and arguably his best effort.<br /><br />It is dense, creative, imaginative, and very complex at times. Talk about layering guitars!
B009X01GJ2|5.0|I really love this product. The only thing I was disappointed about was it didnt come in designs. i would reccommend this product.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Great to watch this season as one show. I lose interest waiting week to week for a series to air on regular t.v.  And free with Amazon Prime!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love it. It's just like Temple Run, but even better. challenging for my eight year old who also loved the movies.
B000VZYPB4|3.0|I love this show. What I dont like is that I can't burn it to a dvd. Once that happens I'll buy them all the time
B006LSZECO|5.0|As soon as I thought I figured out what was going on, I was wrong. Characters are all so loathsome it actually made me feel good about myself : D ! I am now reading the other two books by this wonderful author. I would love to meet her personally and express how much I enjoy her dark humor. Like minds, I say... Thanks for a great read that kept me riveted to the end.
B00003CXWV|5.0|How can you get any anybetter than a coke dealing Johnny Depp?! And the fact that it's based on a true story makes it well worth the money!
B002RRWWQ4|5.0|My family has enjoyed the books and we also enjoy the movies.  These movies do a decent job of following the book.  Just like a lot of movies madE from books they have to leave out small parts of the book.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I really like this game.<br />I play a couple every night so that I don't lose all my coins and options to play longer on the weekends.
B008N1V11U|4.0|The controls are a bit &quot;clunky&quot; with trying to steer the view and moving (similar issues with other Gameloft games). Graphics are great even on the 8.9&quot; HD.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This was a gift for my 10 year old grandson who has spent hour upon hour trying to build and furnish structures while avoiding the destroying factions.  Great array of graphics and sound effects. .
B0049J2BSM|5.0|Fantastic movie.  The picture was amazing.  So glad that I had a quick and easy way to watch this before seeing the new one.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is such a great game. Fun for all ages. If you loved the movies your going to love this game. Can not get enough of it.
B003U6BE8I|4.0|It was fun and the family enjoyed it. The action was great as were the effects. It was a surprise as we had never really heard of it.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This Game Game Makes Me Think Lots And With My Job That Is Good Because That Means I Won't Be Slobbering All Over Myself Sleeping Like An Idiot.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The 3 seasons have been wonderful.  The writing is great, casting couldn't be better, story keeps you wanting more.  Just sorry season 3 is over.  The finale was not what I was expecting.  Waiting on pins and needles for season 4.  You can't go wrong watching this series.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I would suggest this game for any age. Nice clean fun that the whole family can enjoy.  Great!! Fun!! Simple!!
B002JWD6AS|5.0|I almost cried! I didn't but I almost did. I was in the car with my mom and I was like, HE DIDN'T DIE! Ya, real classy of me, but seriously, good book.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Well-written, grabs you by the shirt, whips you around and keeps you enthralled to the very end.<br /><br />I am often reluctant to read much-hyped books but Gone Girl met the mark.  Just don't let any well-meaning referral spoil the plot for you!
0525478817|3.0|Page 3: ROFL, this is hilarious! Pfft, I can't believe people would say this is sad.<br /><br />Page 30: Ok, things are getting deeper.<br /><br />Page 100: I think we all know where this is going.<br /><br />Page 150: Hmm...seems okay so far. Some emotional wreckage, but nothing too serious.<br /><br />Page 230: I hate all life. And this isn't fair. Why why why why???<br /><br />Page 250: Oh, God.<br /><br />I could go on. But I figure that is enough.<br /><br /> There were many moments where I was laughing/crying at the same time...in school. It was horrid, guys.<br /><br />My list of good things:<br /><br />- Let's LOL together. Like I have mentioned above, this is out laugh out funny. No joke. To name a quote:<br /><br />\\"I told Augustus the broad outline of my miracle: diagnosed with Stage IV thyroid cancer when I was thirteen. (I didn't tell him that the diagnosis came three months after I got my first period. Like: Congratulations! You're a woman. Now die.)\\"<br /><br />-Totally emotional. This is an emotional roller-coaster, if you're into that thing. Which I definitely am.<br /><br />-Beautiful writing. Every page I devoured, thanks to the writing( and perhaps 20 different other things.)<br /><br />-Quotable. This goes along with the beautiful writing, but this book is totally quotable. I usually never notice these types of things. I noticed in this book. I just wanted to highlight 3/4 of this book.<br /><br />-Does not sugar-coat things. This is reality, this book. It holds true meaning throughout it. Green obviously doesn't hold back, when it comes to these things...maybe that is why it is very emotional.<br /><br />-Amazing characters. This helps make this book hilarious. I mean, the characters are mostly hilarious throughout, and they also were a huge part why I enjoyed this book so.<br /><br />-Very re-readable. You guys. Usually, after I finish a book, I'm like, never gonna read this again. Not this book. In fact, I plan on re-reading it right about...now, maybe?<br /><br />My list of bad things:<br /><br />-Obvious plot line. I have to admit that from page one, I knew how it ended. It still didn't lessen the blow. Also, it didn't ruin the book for me, which is pretty surprising.<br /><br />-Too sad. This doesn't apply to me, since things are never too sad( unless you kill off all the people I like.). Perhaps, though, you despise every sad book...yeah, not for you.<br /><br />-Very John Green-like-Ok, I'm judging majorly off of reviews. But I couldn't think of any other bad things. Don't judge me.<br /><br />All in all, this book was truly amazing. And though I have heard it is like a very typical cancer book, I don't care. Because of the writing, because of the characters, because of the sadness that will linger within my heart forever...I do not know. Probably all those things together is what did it for me. I had average expectations for this book because it seemed like a contemporary, but it seriously did soar over my expectations. Way, way over.<br /><br />My favorite quote:<br /><br />\\"People will say it's sad that she leaves a lesser scar, that fewer remember her, that she was loved deeply but not widely. But it's not sad, Van Houten. It's triumphant. It's heroic. Isn't that the real heroism?\\"
0132350882|5.0|Not a textbook but a fun read that everyone who calls themselves a developer should read. Boom boom boom boom.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|A fun game for horse lovers. Only thing that bugs me are the ads. After level 9, they started popping up after every mini game
B00785P2QC|5.0|its so addictive I play every day. I'm so happy it is free. I would recommend it for everyone who likes a challenge.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Cute game!!! Great for kids. It's works great on my kindle fire.  It's sorta like subway surfers, but a lot cuter!
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|I really enjoyed this book  I felt like I knew the characters and I really enjoy the way he wove the story together.  It was a beautiful enjoyable story.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I really like this game. The 3-d graphics are amazing, and the picture is so clear. The controls are so simple and it has many helpful tips. Also when you want to buy stuff with bananas it always make me smile because, the idea of buying something with fruit is so adorable. To all those who are going to get this app, be patient. It take a couple of minutes but it is worth the wait, trust me. The only problems are that you can't earn coins you have to buy them, and when you have to defeat someone you can't get out of it until you beat them. I'm trying to defeat meena and she smokes me every time. Overall it is a great game .
B008Y6WMEY|5.0|Great acting, great directing.  Funny and scarry as hell.  If I had to pick only 5 movies to survive nuclear holocaust, this would be one of them.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game was fun all around. It wasn't so hard that I threw my kindle out the window, but  it wasn't completely easy. Can't wait for more rooms.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|This book chronicles the rise of Fascism after WWI and the subsequent rise of the Nazis before and during WWII.  The propaganda machine that fueled Nazi Germany and the Soviet Red Army has chilling parallels with our own mainstream media today.  An excellent follow up by an excellent author, it looks more at the politics of the time rather than the actual war.  Read the first book and then this one if you are a WWII buff.  It sets everything up brilliantly.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|This app works great and operates just like it should !  I normally use Facebook to stay connected and up to date, with this app it makes it a hundred times better. Very satisfied.
0061928356|5.0|The book is more about Mothers than daughters, their love and sacrifice and the importance of family.  It can be an education for any daughter.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I really enjoyed this game one I started I couldn't stop I just had to figure . It the next puzzle I would totally recommend this game to anyone who likes search and find your games
B001BC5HXG|5.0|John Steinbeck, master wordsmith and story teller. I am reading slowly so that I savor every chapter every word. This book is a true masterpiece of literature.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I more than live it :D<br /><br />When I was reading the first chapters, I was wondering if I can even finish reading it. I got confused and all mixed up and I wasn't sure if I was getting the story.<br /><br />But everything just felt right when it finally focuses on the two main characters (Sky and Holder), the attraction, getting to know each other, hidden glances and smile, tormenting each other, those first times, making out, exchanging text messages and it was nice that finally Sky was feeling something deep and extremely new to her.<br /><br />Just like any other novel, it got this mysterious moments circling around every moment Sky and Holder are together and even not. Especially Holder who tends to get easily mad and softened the next time.<br /><br />It's perfectly written that I was feeling giddy whenever they kiss, they are not even having sex and yet it was sweetly close to it that it feels like they are more than making out, it was like I was Sky and I was the one being kissed (yes, seriously!!!!)<br /><br />It might sound like I'm being biased and that Colleen Hoover is one of my favorite authors, but really even on Slammed, I definitely love her writing style. And here she did it again, it might be simple but between those sentences, they have deep meaning that you have no difficulty grasping. She also have originality, and make words with new meaning. And I learned another from her again:<br /><br />\\"What?\\" He shakes his head, trying to understand<br />my response.<br />\\"Live. If you mix the letters up in the words like and love, you get live. You can use that word.<br /><br />When I was already halfway from reading it, I was sort of reading it slowly because I was not ready to end it. I rarely ask/wishes for a sequel, because its painful to wait, but this time I was hoping that this was a series or there is a sequel, cause I need more Holder!! My perfect Holder!<br /><br />The twist here is new to me, but the best part here and of course there is no doubt, is Dean Holder is freaking too perfect to be real anymore. For being so open-minded, understanding, patient, loving and strong for the both of them. For me he's the reason the story keeps rocking!<br /><br />Colleen Hoover, filled this story with hope and moving forward. I will give this full 5 stars, because it's more than i LIVE it. :D
B00CRMWMZ0|3.0|I am actually a little disappointed in this album. Maybe its just too slow for me? I love the great musicians playing and contributing, the real instruments used. Some of the upbeat songs are great to dance to (Get lucky) and others are plain old Daft Punk awesome (Gorgio, Get it right). Yet the slower songs like Game of Love, Within, are borderline cheesy and just too sleep inducing. For this guy who still loves to listen to Homework all the way, Random Access Memories does not have much shelf life...
B000FCKGPC|4.0|Nothing much happens in this book...but I had to give it 4 stars because Martin's writing is so addictive. I think he could make a laundry list into an gripping tale.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I like it so far. Coins take a bit to earn, but not too bad. Great game if you like horses.
B00AB7IA1S|1.0|This game is HORRIBLE. I was having great fun when I got to level 3.7 in which you get to use the tornado fan. It look easy, but no, there had to be a glitch. The first tornado fan is glitched. When I put it out, the balloon crashed into it like it was a wall! It was telling me that the balloon had crashed! Please fix! And If they don't fix it, for those who are looking to buy this game, don't wast your money.
B000I3W1XS|5.0|Can't beat the original cast.  Set quality is coming up and the action rolls on.  A must for all trekkies
B00BI6SSMC|4.0|I know Sam Beam has a bunch of kids to feed, so I don't blame him for shooting for commercial success.  A couple of top forty hits would be nice at this point in his career.  This album is less folk and more pop.  Unfortunately for me I like I and R when the mandolins and pedal steel are prominent.  Good album, but Shepherd's Dog had more of that twang I love.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|Loved the action.  Can not wait to find out what happens in the next book. Hope Clary has more powers.
B009B1UZ7C|5.0|Jake Bugg is a great mix of folk and rockabilly.  Good poetry and lots of energy.  If you like Dylan, Woody, Elvis, or Bright Eyes.  you will enjoy this.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|I wanted to see the new one in theaters but I hadn't seen this one yet.<br />The movie was very cute and family friendly.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|I don't know how you keep making a story more and more interesting, but this series does it!  Can't wait it read the third book!
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|Does not allow me to update it with the new ice park when I click App store  to update it and when I click silk It still does nothing
B007V80WUC|5.0|What can I say?  This is truly fantastic modern progressive music.  Circus is lined up to succeed DT as top prog-metal whenever DT decides to close up shop.  The guitars, drums and bass are on par with DT in terms of skill and technical/songwriting prowess.  The keys and vocals are better.  The keyboardist actually contributes to the melody rather than scratching wildly on touch-pad like Rudess is known to over-do.  The vocalist sounds like he is trying to mimic LaBrie in some places, but fortunately can not manage to be that bad and does not succeed.  I would challenge any DT fan to say that they could tell the difference between some of the guitar passages on this album and some of Petrucci's work.  Not possible.  The sound is in places identical and the musicianship on par. The only criticism is that in several places you can actually hear passages from DT songs in their music....not exact but pretty darn close. Overall, a great sound, great compositions, phenomenal guitar work - a joy to the progressive ear.  I like Nine the most so far.  I tried Isolate and am not quite caring for it as much, overall, although there are some fine songs in there.
B00D6BN9NK|4.0|Nothing can beat the original die hard, short movie went by quick, but hey Im a big Bruce willis fan, so I give it 4..
B001ANSSDC|5.0|The book was very good.<br />Here is my option<br />It was funny and it was touching.<br /> I really liked Pat Peoples.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|A good app to  people who love  horse  or any animal in general. Thus app is defamatory a five star app
B00C9U9YOW|5.0|There are very few albums I listen to over and over again the first time I play them.  This is one of them.  I've listened to little else since I purchased it.... in my car, my home, my ear buds, my head.  Can't wait to see QOTSA live.... again.
B002GSXKN8|4.0|Have this for myself and my grandson want the same<br />he had two of them but not all 4 and his were damaged from excessive use<br />He is a major Batman fan.
B00011D1OA|5.0|Old time classic, great stars, and priced right... This is a 2 disc special edition with excellent sound and picture quality...
B00CHI5B7A|4.0|Good story and good action. Knowing it was based on real life characters made the movie better. Worth watching this one.
B005FLX1HS|5.0|Loved the music. Arrived on time. Everything about it is great. The songs are pretty damn good. I'd recommend to any dubstep lovers.
B00CCEHYO2|5.0|This is definitely the best STS record to date!! They have grown so much as musicians compared to their previous two records (which I love); it is a worthwhile endeavor to explore the sound scapes of this growth. STS have what I love in my music: melody, beauty, great song writing & progressive elements. These are also the qualities that set them apart from other progressive bands. They have also raised their song crafting to another level; at times, I am even reminded of Satriani & Dream Theater in thier prime. With regards to this whole djent fad that is consuming most heavy music nowadays (i.e. dumbing down superb metal riffage for low 8th string mindless chugging),  I can certainly say that when it finally keels over (with Animals as Leaders & Periphery as the very, very few survivors), STS will still be standing making amazing & memorable music. This album is a phenomenal combination of clean delicate transparent guitar tones, memorable melody lines, dense guitar riffage, luscious songwriting & borderline Dream Theater complexity. This is probably the best instrumental album this year. Hands down.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is awesome i played it on ny step moms phone addicted my phone doesent have enuf space but i didint know it was avable on kendalls im sooo happy yay
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|great I love this game its for all ages and I love playing my friends!!! great job!!! I usually play this game when I'm not busy '!!
B00A77II0U|5.0|I enjoyed this game....I would definitely recommend. Great story line...not too hard, yet not too easy either. The hint button helps when you get stuck.  It wasn't a short game either. Had no issues with bugs or anything else. A+++
B00BRH2MN8|5.0|I LOVE her sound. She has amazing vocals, beats and lyrics. Her words are not superficial and very relate-able. So good
B003IN7YPU|5.0|There are newer documentaries about WWII out there but this is still one of the best. This series looks at not only the conflict that was WWII but the home fronts, the politics, philosophies, the aftermath on all major combatants and the dark side of the war. One of the things I like best about this series is the act that since it was completed only a few decades after the war many of the actual people who lived the experiences are the ones being interviewed capturing memories and experiences before they were lost forever to time. The digitization of the pictures and sound on the blu ray set are in keeping with the high quality established during the original production. This is a must have for WWII historians, buffs and enthusiasts.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|95 percent dialog and very little action until the last few chapters.  Mr. Martin also has a habit of killing off my favorite characters. Interesting but frustrating.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Just downloaded this game to my kindle fire, and have played it only once, and I love it!! I can't wait to share it with my grandchildren!! I know they will love it too!
B008I3QZKU|5.0|Great album, few amazing songs, a couple boring but overall a great achievement by brandon and his band, good service from amazon, very pleased
B005OT2YVA|5.0|Prime membership is well worth it.  watched Transformers - star trek - and others while the kids were on the video games on tv
B0053YGYO4|3.0|the album presented it self with a couple of amazing songs, but overall the album was quite of a disappointment, definitely not their best...
B000HKYOK0|5.0|Amazon Prime works as promised.  enjoyed watching the original star trek while the kids were playing their video games on the tv
0805088997|5.0|I like what I buy is a good deal for the price is a nice buy I really recommend this book
B00270WH3Y|5.0|One of those that I originally had on vinyl, then on cassette tape, then on CD. Somewhere along the way the CD got lost. But, saw it in the $5 album list and had to have it again. Some great tunes by a classic group; just two guys with a guitar (and sometimes some additional instrumental accompaniment) with some fantastic harmonies. If you're not familiar with these guys, this is a great deal at $5.
B00BOUL9DM|5.0|This is fun and challenging.  I enjoy the pictures and the clever way they are associated.  Love sitting on my deck in the evenings and unwinding with this simple game.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|This app was easy to d/l, easy to set to preferences, easy to use and very affordable, but it wasn't boring.  Which is what you usually end up with when you have all the former.  That for me was a big plus. I use it A LOT bc I travel quite a bit and I have a tendency to run late.  Now, I set little alarms ahead of time bc I`m always with &quot;nose in Kindle Fire HD&quot; anyway. :oP
B00CRWJ5GO|4.0|All I can say is this movie has kept me thinking about it for 3 days now. At first I was confused but as time went on (it is a long movie)<br />I began to see the different meanings. Then the next day I went back and used my roku to hit various scenes throughout the film because I<br />felt myself being called to take a second look. I didn't of course have enough time to sit and watch again and I used the roku remote to<br />hit through various scenes. It helped and I saw things that I had missed the night before as well as came away with a new understanding<br />which has made me want to run out and get the book.<br /><br />This is a moving and touching film and it matters. It's a film for thinkers as well as doers. I think it's an underrated movie and is deserving<br />of an award for the major and I mean colossal effort it took to translate this film from a book onto the big screen while keeping the flow of<br />such a film from becoming a visual and metaphorical nightmare. It's anything but that. All I can say is, WOW!
B0081X8AE6|5.0|I got turned onto Michael Kiwanuka while searching YouTube for less listened to Jake Bugg songs.  Bugg does a very good cover or Kiwanuka's song, \\"Tell Me a Tale\\".  I loved it so I looked up Michael Kiwanuka and haven't stopped listening to him since then.  There is a spate of good music out there these days and Kiwanuka is near the top.  He writes with such passionate simplicity that the lyrics alone will completely draw you in.  On the other hand, melodically, he has been blessed with genius.  Like Bugg's first album, there isn't a loser on \\"Home Again\\".  I have listened to it over and over again and never tire of it.  My husband (a musician) says he wakes with Kiwanuka's songs going through his head and that's a totally good thing.  Almost forgot - Kiwanuka's songs have a very healing, spiritual element to them.  Those of you who have listened will understand when I say, without Kiwanuka, I'm just bones!
B009XIXVU6|2.0|This book by Khaled Hosseini disappointed me.  After reading his first novel, which I could not put down, this one was a disappointment to me.  I hope he continues writing, but can recapture the charm of the first novel he wrote.
B00821PCJS|5.0|Good plot. Good acting and exposition. Newish spin on the old post-apocalyptic survival story. Character growth is subtle and so-so. However, the solid, well paced character development and fast moving plot picks up the slack.
B00DC7N9NS|2.0|For the amount they spent on the the Computer generated graphics it's a shame they didn't spend more on a decent Director and script. Found myself constantly skipping ahead because the dialogue dragged and seemed long and unnecessary like it was just there to fill up space. It shows a powerhouse of video graphics on top of an amateurish production. While I can watch Tim Burton's Dark Shadows numerous times and never tire because of it's quick pace and excellent editing that removed all unnecessary scenes and dialogue, this movie does the opposite. Do we really need a young womanizing Oz who uses his magic tricks to exploit women for sex, and was OZ really responsible for the creation of the Wicked Witch after he used and dumped her in favor of her Sister ? Oh well, guess I can count myself lucky I didn't spend $25+ to own this release, the irony being we are watching a movie about a flim flam man who uses cheap tricks to make money off people's gullibility.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I loved the season three except for one thing. I won't spoil it, but what a surprise. Of course I'm glued on pins and needles for season four. No other show on tv has ever kept me glued to watch but Downton Abbey. If you've never watched it..start from the beginning, it is surely worth it..I promise.
B0063M22QO|5.0|This game rocks.  I recommend it to anyone who likes to play Mahjong on facebook, I like it a lot.
B00CWY76CC|1.0|I played a version of a Room Escape game on a friend's laptop. I was enjoying the game until it froze on the third screen. None of the items would open so I couldn't solve any of the puzzles. There's no skip feature so I couldn't get past the buggy screen. I tried reinstalling it. Sync didn't help either. I'm using a First Generation Kindle Fire, so maybe that's the problem. It's not difficult to solve the puzzles. It has a nice look. A more powerful processor would probably help.
B000W1T1Q6|5.0|I had never heard of Shirley Horn until this week.  My friend Rhonda sent me a taste of the album and I love it.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|After reading the first two in the series I couldn't wait for June 4th for the final book.  It was amazing and everything I had waited for until...spoiler alert...I found there is now a 4th!
B00DGNO3WE|5.0|Wonderful movie with wonderful actors!  Dustin Hoffman did a great job bringing it to the screen. He also directed the movie.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|What a fantastic game that makes critical thinking really fun! I couldn't stop playing until I got through all 10 levels. Now I can't wait for more! Hope the developers open more levels soon. I'm hooked!
B006IMY5ZU|5.0|Five stars not because it is the best movie I have ever seen but because it is perfect at what it does: pacing is perfect; acting altogether entertaining; and it tells a story that we already know without boring us for even a second.  I was entirely charmed by this film.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Most fun out of all the puzzles I have played. Fun or all ages. Simulates the mind and very relaxing. A must try puzzle!
B000GCFO08|5.0|OK ITS A LITTLE UNEXCITING AND ALL AFTER WATCHING IT 70 THOUSAND TIMES BUT STILL A GOOD AND GOREY MOVIE
B00499QUK2|5.0|I would definitely recommend this series. The Acting is excellent and the plots exciting and fresh, I wasn't sure I would like a modern day take on Holmes and Watson but I really enjoyed the show.
0345803485|5.0|Even more adventure and alluring, this final book can keep you awake just to know what is going to happen at the end.
B009GED3HS|5.0|I absolutely love this show. My favorite on tv. Give it a shot if you've never seen it. (Two more words were required, so here goes...) Legen -- Dary :)
0345803493|5.0|Just more things developed during this second book, definitely unveils both characters .. couldn't stop reading it and waiting for the final one.
B00499NHLC|4.0|Much better than most of the bs currently on TV, but its not at the level of The Wire or Breaking Bad.
0345803507|5.0|Definitely worth reading it and kept you in the story, you just want to read more and more about both characters.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|I love twitter, and it works very well on the kindle. I really enjoy reading my tweets and looking at pictures.
B00CRS88IO|2.0|It started quite good. I enjoyed the detailed descriptions of WWII weaponry that spoke to a level of detail that I didn't anticipate.  Unfortunately, this attention to detail did not extend to the font, the grammar and in some instances gaps in the storyline that spoiled what could've been a pleasant read.
B008MEM24S|5.0|We did the Secret Agent phone tracker at Epcot. Where they give you a cell phone and it gives you clues. It is a lot of fun for kids, and this was a great way to supplement there love of puzzles and riddles. it also is actually a logic and reason game, so it helps develop skills.
B00DC7N9NS|5.0|With the way the main character started out, I honestly didn't think I would like it. The character development in the movie is superb, and I fell in love with the characters.
B00C7DGQ9C|3.0|Relatively entertaining, the plot while thin moves along and there are enough action scenes to keep you entertained.  Good enough entertainment.
B002G01EPC|5.0|Yes, its the most bad ass character of Dragon Ball ever, all green and purple and ready to make your others toy look like crap. This figure is amazing, is a perfect tridimensional recreation of the character, and is the same size than most Marvel Legends, and almost the same as DC universe Classics. Got lots of accesories like interchangable hands, 3 heads, the cape, and a set of croosing arms, for resting after blowing your shelves with a Makankosapoo
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Great show.!!! I would recommend it to everyone.Thanks Amazon for having it on Prime.It makes it easy to watch.Can't wait for season 3.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I have my own horses which I am currently away from. This is all the fun with non  of the work!
B0064X7FVE|2.0|I really liked the prior version of this app but the upgrade stinks! It is cumbersome and the ads at the bottom a big distraction. Removed it from my Kindle.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|Being an animal lover of all kinds, this was wonderful to see such love from a dog, that loved his owner picked out by himself.<br />You wonder if animals could pick their owner would they pick you?  The love from Hachi went beyond the death of Richard Gere,<br />how many of us have done the same for a loved one, never forgetting the devoation from that person special. A great movie for a teenager or new pet owner, to know the love you give a animal will come back to you ten fold.
B000E1ZBFY|5.0|This movie was enjoyed by all in our family which includes 2 - 20 somethings. This was a true story of the life of Pope John Paul II.  I was very surprised to learn the extent of the different facets to his life. His legacy will live on forever as the church will elevate him to Saint in December.  If anyone is intersted in having knowledge about this wonderful human being please buy this movie!! Loved it!!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I was so engrossed in every word. I couldn't stop reading. Every word, every sentence left me wanting more. Excellent
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I like the game but needed more levels. You may think it is broken but the point is to tap on things and find your way out
B00CLD65X0|5.0|Downtown Abbey, is truly the best.  We are looking forward to season four! One just can't get enough of the on going drama but it's with so much taste and style.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I just felt in love with the way is written and Is easy to read even if English is your second language.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great game way better than temple run and subway surfers combined. The game is very fun and is hard to put down I am hooked to the game
B00785P2QC|4.0|i used to play this game a long time ago but i stopped and now i started playin it again
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|I love this game it's just like the movie I recommend it if you like games like dragon vale or tribez  you will never want to delete it
B00D41H2PS|5.0|I enjoyed playing this game, solving the puzzles, and noticing the details in the scenes.  The games aren't really &quot;games&quot; just object manipulation which you can't do if you don't pay attention.  It is short but that's perfect since I don't have a lot of time to spend on a long and involved plot.  It costs just over a buck and I think it was worth it.  (I am not a developer, when I read a couple bad reviews about the length I just have to shake my head and wonder what the heck people expect for a buck.) I rate it 5 stars for this reason.  If it cost more, I may not have given 5.  It was well done.  Thank you.
B00DHNJ0I0|4.0|Danish director Niels Arden Oplev brings his talent for relentless uneasiness on the screen in this story by Joel Howard Wyman. The theme is not good guy versus bad guy because every character in the film is a bad guy/girl  and once the audience tunes into that then the emphasis is on that elusive human reaction to trauma called revenge.<br /><br />Victor (Colin Farrell) is a Hungarian immigrant whose wife and daughter were killed and he is out to destroy the Albanian crime gang that caused their death. He has infiltrated the crime empire run by ruthless kingpin Alphonse (Terrence Howard), with the single purpose of making Alphonse pay for destroying his once happy life. Victor's best friend is crime cohort Darcy (Dominic Cooper) whose obsessive curiosity about his friend opens the story for insertion of all manner of bad tings. As he meticulously orchestrates his vengeance from his high-rise home, Victor watches and is watched by Beatrice (Noomi Repace, a mysterious young woman, her face is disfigured from a car accident, who lives with her mother (Isabelle Huppert) in the apartment across from his. On the surface a fragile woman-child, Beatrice seethes with a rage of her own: she sees the death of the drunken driver who caused her facial excoriations and rebuilding attempts. When she uncovers Victor's dark secrets, she threatens to expose him unless he helps her carry out her own campaign of retribution. Each fixated on avenging the past, they devise a violent and cathartic plan that could change their worlds forever.<br /><br />One of the reasons this film works so well is that incredibly magnetic brooding presence of Colin Farrell, but the other reasons the story pushes along at a breakneck speed is the quality of the rest of the cast. Noomi Repace, Isabelle Huppert (still one of the finest actresses on the screen today), Dominic Cooper, Terrence Howard, Armand Assante, F. Murray Abraham, James Biberi, Luis Da Silva Jr., Stu Bennett, Franky G and all the members of this huge cast deliver well for director Opley.<br /><br />This is a dark film about the dark subject of revenge. With Colin Farrell at the helm it works very well! Grady Harp, July 13of this huge cast deliver well for director Opley.<br /><br />This is a dark film about the dark subject of revenge. With Colin Farrell at the helm it works very well! Grady Harp, July 13
B00CTKHXFO|5.0|The nes games are in the menu for snake eater BTW. Younger players may have trouble playing the old views and controls- in mgs 2 especially. Don't expect to have your hand held through this either, they are difficult games, but that's part of what makes them masterpieces. No one does it quite like Kojima.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|What a wonderful story. I am a dog lover at heart and Denny's determination along with Enzo's was inspirational. I cried so hard at the end that my own dog came to me too give me her love.
B008518MOW|5.0|Quick Shipment. And the product is wonderful but than again I saw the movie in theater and I loved it then and I love it now.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|This was the best Lincoln movie I've seen. It does a better job of catching President Lincolns sense of humor then other movies have.
B0063GORYU|5.0|If you are not familiar with the game, it it a similar type game to solitaire where cards have to be placed in sequence to build total decks - from K at the top, to 2, A at the bottom.  I've known this game for a long time but just now downloaded it to my iPhone.  It is modified from other versions I've known, to be quicker responding, and that seems to make it more fun, in so far as if you play the game at a fast pace, it can keep up with you.  Other versions do not.  I like the game a lot; it serves as an easy break when I need to &#34;get away&#34; for a few seconds, and can't actually go anywhere.  And I like it a lot because you don't have to rely on someone to make a move in the game before you can!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|This book is the best of her series by far.  It is a book that you can not put down..
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is so much fun!! J love playing with mu friends and trying to.bear their highscores!<br /><br />Have fun playing this addictive game! You'll her hooked on it!
B007R21JJK|5.0|I am very happy with this motherboard.  It was super easy to install and it saved me a bunch of money by not needing a separate GPU for my non-gaming rig.
B00CM9JKQM|5.0|This is the music Queensryche is known for; thought provoking and orchestrated! This cd moves from song to song like Operation Mindcrime. I'm one of their fans, seen 'em 4 times and now would love to see this tour. It's been too long for Tate not to show off that brilliant escalating voice! A must have for your cd collection.
B000FC2L1E|5.0|Loved the story however it was slow going occasionally I am looking forward to the next installment of the Outlander.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|This edition is really just as much fun as the first. Th New powers add a bit of variety, and the fact that it includes some of the space physics is really awesome. Great game all the way around.
B009HQ9UHC|2.0|Not nearly as fun as angry birds and the numerous ads make playing the game so slow. Already removed it from my kindle.
B00B0TO3PI|5.0|I love watching this show. I agree that the third season feels different than the first and second season, but I like it none the less.<br /><br />Does anybody know why a married woman could have breakfast in bed, while a single woman could not?<br /><br />Also, when the family is done eating they look at each other and say \\"Should we go through\\"? Any idea what that means?
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I like how real it looks, I really love horses and dream of owning one, one day! I already am addicted to this game.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|It's a very cute ,fun, and unique app there is so much color and excitement I would recommend this app to everyone children and adults the graphics are awesome and so is the game itself the only problem I ever had was that u had to pay with real money
B009EAO38C|5.0|This is a really great CD!  I had never heard of these guys before and I saw a friend's post of Facebook highlighting one of their songs.  If you like some music to help you unwind from a long day at work, this would be the ticket.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this app. It helps me take care of my horse. My horse is sweet and everything an owner can wish for.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|You know when people say, &#34;I couldn't put the book down&#34;?  I've never experienced a book where I felt that way, until now.  This is one of the best books I've ever read.
0316044695|5.0|I'm starting to get into reading a lot, and this was a great start. Easy to get into. Incredible story.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is amazing and addictive. I have only played this for one day a nd I'm already in love with it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I think that this is a wonderful was to pass the time. It is soooo much fun. I totally recomend it to anyone!
B001RTP3Z0|5.0|I love this recording.  I have played it over quite a few times and have enjoy it just as much as the first time I watched it.
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|This movie was full of action and emotion. Very fun to watch. Visually interesting. The one-liners were fun and clever, but not overdone. All in all, a great movie for the whole family.
B000HEWEDK|5.0|It's already established fact that Forbidden Planet is one of the best movies of its kind, introducing the concept of hyper drive, and measuring space travel time in parsecs. The monsters from the id idea is strongly parallel to the Biblical truth that human nature is corrupted by sin, which can only be conquered through death, therefore the true cause of death is moral. The movie closes with the statement that man is not God, in a context that demonstrates that technology cannot remove evil from human nature. Christ Himself taught that the human heart is the source of all evil in the world. I found the bonus movie, The Invisible Boy to be most entertaining,especially the end, and the discussion of Science Fiction films featuring George Lucas, Steven Spielberg, James Cameron, and Ridley Scott, narrated by Mark Hamill, to be quite good as well.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|Awesome Game For Children Who Love To Play Them Shooting Games.  Also This Game Has A Lot Of Graphics That Help You See The  Game In A Totally Different Way.
B009FZFONO|5.0|The series just keeps getting better, and this season really blew us away! Don't get too comfy with any of your favorite characters...!
B00AQ71FLK|4.0|I like the game a lot. However I am a little bummed out that you barely get as ny money after a game. Plus many of the heroes are overly expensive. Other than that it is a really good game.
B005LAIHY0|5.0|Sent to Austria, although it is not possible to download the digital copies or use the streaming services over here. A big minus!
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|I have had so much fun on this game. It's so fun to play all 4 classes in the amazing maps. Recommended
B004EPYZXU|5.0|Sent to Austria, although it is not possible to download the digital copies over here. A big minus! Try again
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love this game and I love all the levels when I think of the levels that I have to come across I think that they are hard
B00C7TAF3Y|3.0|Just a little information as to what is expected to find what your looking for.  I spent too much time before I discovered you could move the key and around and that you needed to in order to fit the key.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|The only thing I wish was different is that you only get 3 helps and then nothing, maybe if you were on a point system or something and every 10 or 20 puzzles you completed perfectly gained you another help.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Some stories are easy to predict what might happen next. This did not, grabbed my attention and did not disappoint.<br />I had to buy the Videos (season 1 & 2) to go along with read.  Looking forward to Book 2.
0061146307|2.0|The narrator treats the story very matter-of-factly, with a sort of aged tone, yet without making much use of \\"big\\" words or complex language but rather saying things like \\"Of course\\", \\"Indeed\\", \\"On the other hand\\", \\"I suppose\\", and \\"Perhaps\\" quite often, which lends it a slightly cheesy or even phony quality. (I say this since the word choice is drab to me most of the time, and if it was more impressive it would support the old-fashioned tone heaps more.) The reading level is elementary, not quite at Harry Potter's, although the narrator seems to talk down to the reader a bit and literally explains the definitions of various (and not very difficult) words at least once every chapter.<br /><br />The humor is subtle (or at least meant to be) and everywhere, yet at the same time almost nonexistent as it is not even that funny. It's more of a character or tone quality than actual punch lines, where the specific subject isn't predictable but the humor itself is, kind of the same old thing, which makes it a bit of a chore to get through (unless you like that sort of thing). The narrator expects the reader to take the story quite seriously for the humor to be at all effective, which could work for some young readers I guess. The characters themselves seem to be just a collection of tropes, and even breaking the fourth wall isn't nearly as exciting as one would expect, not at all tongue in cheek. I would call the book's humor mild at best.<br /><br />The author does deserve credit for the story line itself though, as it's really very good, and comes close to balancing the rest of the book's faults (which accounts for its best-selling status); I just wish it was more tastefully delivered. That's the decisive factor for me personally: good taste. The book left me feeling ripped off in that regard, as that was the whole reason for its purchase - which, according to popular belief, should have been satisfactory. When it comes to matters of taste, apparently this is where I differ from the rest.<br /><br />- Robby
1781162646|4.0|An amusement park with it's own ghost and a dark secret. A little boy with a gift of second sight. A college kid working through a failed relationship with a summer job at Joyland finds more than he bargained for. This was a great summer read. I didn't want it to end.
B00AVFO41K|3.0|this downloaded and functioned fine on my first gen kindle.<br /><br />this game is just okay - if is relatively easy to play even without the instructions - you makes lines of 5 or more marbles to make them go away - every time you move a marble more appear, which is one of my complaints, because too many appear too quickly to really get a handle on the game. there are special marbles that can help if you match them up.... but even with those it fills up quickly. the game is not horrible just not one that is going to hold my interest long - it takes some strategy and some luck (as to what color / type of marbles that show up) and may be amusing to someone into this type of game.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Everything about this show is brilliant. You become more and more attached to each character with every episode. The story lines never let you down and the twists in the plots leave you wanting more.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This book will be read again.  I have recommended it to friends.  The medical facts portrayed by an esteemed surgeon sets this book apart from the other NDE writings.  I was truly sorry the book had to end...excellent writing was a plus!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It's fun and challenging. Gotta be quick. Would recommend this game to anyone especially someone who has kids. Really enjoyable.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|I had trouble with a brand-name charger previously, so I returned it and bought the charger from Anker. It worked exactly as advertised.  No muss, no fuss; just plugged it in, connected my phone cord, and forgot about it--which is the way all chargers should work.
B0058A119G|5.0|More than wonderful. If I let it, it's the kind of music that can saturate my mind and soul like therapy.
B003ES61EE|5.0|This product works for the camera and it works very good. It's cheap and affordable for camera lovers like me
B0051ANPZQ|3.0|It was slow paced but overall a good book. Well and stuff didn't blow up which was a bummer .
B005CKPQNE|3.0|Had to wait a month to watch it because amazon won't let me watch the shows I purchased in Mexico. Good series.
B008JGSM6G|3.0|It's okay to play when you are tired and don't want to think too hard!!  It's good when you are killing time for a short period.
B00DMM3WVM|4.0|First time I've played a mobile game that actually scared me.  when i got to the trees it just got scarier.
0142403873|5.0|My little guy loves this book so much! He is ten months old and smiles and gets excited when we take it out and laughs throughout it. We read this to him multiple times a day...I can recite it word of word from memory and I'm sure he will be able to someday too.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I really liked this book because Suzanne really described and I just really liked how many details she put in the book.
0142405809|5.0|I love this story, it's not my son's favorite but he does enjoy it. I'm sure as he gets older he will appreciate it a little more. It is a nice break from the typical child stories.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Great game when I first downloaded it. I even got pretty far with no issues. And then the Update. Contacted Amazon, and they were unable to help. Contacted the game company, Ludia, and have yet to hear back. But the issue has been resolved!<br /><br />The new update includes an Ice Age theme, complete with Ice Age mammals! If you uninstalled the game because of the update issue, I recommend reinstalling and giving it a second chance. As for how to install? I attempted to log in, same as the night before, expecting the same issue. Instead, to my happy surprise, a loading bar appeared at the bottom of my screen (apparently the update), and my game loaded, nothing lost but a little time.<br /><br />The new expansion can be accessed through the same portal as the Aquatic expansion. There are quests ready and waiting when you arrive. Still a great game!
B005544V6A|5.0|The first time I began watching Suits was with a girlfriend who just had it on. It's fairly witty and well written. Given the setting in NY, the pompous prestige of Harvard Law, and the fashion, Suits is an interesting drama full of deceit and sexual innuendos.
B00499QUK2|5.0|My son told me about this show so my wife & I decided to check it out. We were hooked by half way through the first episode and will be watching all the available episodes as we find the time. Highly recommend it to anyone with even a remote interest in Sherlock Holmes.
B004UJTG6Q|2.0|Hard to understand with old English!! Though I really do like the storyline and tom and hucks adventures. But the old English was horrid
B005WKKI96|5.0|I bought it for my wife and she loves this CD! the only problem, she playing this CD to much everyday and some times boring myself.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|This episode is awesome!  I'm soo ready for Season 9 to start.  The ending of this season leaves you wondering and ecstatic 😁 for the next episode!  Really loved it! 👍
B0042J6VUS|5.0|One particular thing, which I did expect, is the product is put together cheaply. Very cheaply, indeed but in all fairness, I didn't expect much more for only costing me a total of a couple dollars. The shipping took 3-4 weeks since it was coming from China but that was also something divulged up front. Cheap product, honest seller, and really, I got more than my money's worth.
B00847KFDS|5.0|good  old Fogerty tunes, but  getting old ! Should have done different versions of the tunes with all that talent on hand. But as a Fogerty fan, I still enjoyed.<br />Frank T.
B002BU0DPE|4.0|I don't use these for gaming, but use it for conversing on Skype, Google Hangout, etc. several times a day for remote work. The mic does a good job of ignoring the usual background noise like fans and what not, and the headphones have good sound.<br /><br />The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars, is that there is a constant noise in the headphones when it is on, that isn't noticeable when there are other sounds, but if you're waiting for a conference to start, it kind of makes you want to stab your ears out after a few moments.<br /><br />Also of note: you cannot use the headphones at all unless it's plugged into a powered USB port, even if you don't want to use the mic. It has a separate headphone cord, so it seems like it should work, but does not. No big deal.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|This book was recommended to me by a co-worker as an enjoyable read. I started reading it and really liked the story as I am in the medical profession and liked the &#34;medical&#34; story very much. After reading maybe a third of the book my own Dad got ill and passed away so I needed to put the book down. Now I had an entirely new perspective on the book and really enjoyed the &#34;proof of heaven&#34; aspect. Some of the book is a little wordy and over-descriptive which helps you realize that &#34;heaven&#34; is beyond words. The book is very helpful with loss. Very well written and a good quick read. I have recommended it to many of my friends!
B007L3BMGA|5.0|Really interesting... Had me glued from the beginning!<br />I was intrigued by Christian and it was a wonderful escape from daily routine. When is the next series of books?
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is simply a wonderful app.  Works perfectly and comes in handy.  I appreciate that the numbers and buttons are large and the display is clear.  I also like how it displays what numbers and operations I have entered.

B00CEF014E|4.0|I personally didn't find it that dark, but I do think it is a good read. The young girl, Dana, she's had psychological issues in the past. She's even spent a little time in a couple of institutions. Her boyfriend goes missing. In the search for him she falls into the hands of an ancient cult. I thought the concept of the entire story is really good. Kind of wish I could give this story 4 1/2 stars. The ending is really what I wanted to see, but I didn't expect.<br /><br />Was given a copy for a review.
B009ZQ8FQG|2.0|Snoozer.  Loved the first two seasons.  Hopefully killing off the goodie-goodies this season will improve season four.  If you haven't watched season 3 yet - skip it.
B006FE83UE|5.0|this movie has lessons that apply to all generations. it was a required reading when i was in school.  should be the same now.
B00CHSPB8Y|1.0|Never got to play it.... keeeps asking for a update but ky kindles not big enough... so either the game sucked or my kindle does
B00BEJ5O6Q|5.0|Once again Blake Shelton has a home run! It has fun songs and songs that are thought provoking. I've listened to it many, many times.
B005IQZB14|5.0|I looked forward every evening to joining Cheryl on the trail. What a transforming adventure she had. Loved every page.
0811729117|4.0|My husband reads military history and is enjoying this book. Since it is written from the point of view of the German tank commander it is unique from any other books he has read. My husband is a retired Army tank commander and has much respect for the Panzers. He is taking some of it with a grain of salt since after all the German's were our enemies and his father was a tanker in WWII.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|I was just browsing for something to watch when I found this, I started it up and watched a little to see if I would like it then shut it off and waited a week before I finished watching it. I started it over again to understand the story line and couldn't stop watching once the action started.
B00D6BU8GG|3.0|Competently made, pure entertainment value, do suspend your disbelief as story is full if holes and its star, Bruce Willis, a bit long in the tooth to play the hero (even though they gave him Millenium age kids to attract the coveted 18-34 demo segment.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|Challenging yet fun as it engages you in an exciting world of adventure. The graphics are very realistic. Definitely one of the best
B00CHSPB8Y|1.0|Slows the phone way down, I kept getting annoying updates. Graphics are good, gameplay pretty repetitive, not great. Menu is not user friendly.
034580404X|5.0|I would definitely read again when i have time.  I have also lent these to several friends and they have enjoyed too.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I don't usually write harsh reviews without at least a little praise or constructive suggestions but there is no alternative here.  This redesign is a sad, garbled, useless mess (as of July 9, 2013, Ver. 4.1.2x adad45d).  We've used the Weather Channel app (Android version for the Kindle Fire HD) since late 2012 and found the earlier version immediately intuitive and sensible, especially the at-a-glance multi-day view.  But this pointless update drove a 5 star to a 1 star literally overnight.  The new interface is a non-intuitive mess that looks like something a first time app designer slapped together.  We've switched to Weather Bug for now.  If the Weather Channel doesn't switch back to a more intuitive, sensible app design we'll be deleting this permanently.  We don't object to the ads or the points - we understand the realities of monetization for free apps.  But this incredibly poor design will simply drive away your potential traffic.<br /><br />And I'm not talking about tweaking it to make it better.  I can't think of a single constructive suggestion to merely tweak the redesign and make it better.  At the very least you might consider making the old version optional for tablet users, if the goal was to redesign the app primarily for smaller mobile devices.<br /><br />Update 7/17/13: I tried the new Weather Channel app for a week alongside the Weather Bug app.  The Weather Channel app is crap.  I deleted it.  I'm reasonably satisfied with Weather Bug, although I'd like to see the old familiar and immediately intuitive Weather Channel app return.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|Action Packed, enjoy the personalities, great mix,<br />I can overlook and enjoy everything except the invisable flying aircraft carrier. Really?
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Everyone can play this game it is so fun any age can but sometimes it is a little hard but so fun
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Very visually entertaining.  Keeps a fast pace that calls to you to continue .  Not sure yet if it is worth the highend pricing:-)
B0063IH60K|5.0|I really like this app it's really fun it is simple but it has some cool features love the app.
0307271080|5.0|Adichie takes us into America from a different perspective, that of an young African student, as she deals with other blacks in America of every type and how greatly they differ from each other.  She also describes the differences among American whites in fascinating ways as the heroine makes her way-- searching for work, getting into academia, falling in and out of love.  Her writing is wonderful, with surprises in every chapter.  Very hard to get anything else done while reading this book!  Just want to read it and read it then go and talk with her young heroine about sharing her life in such an open way.
