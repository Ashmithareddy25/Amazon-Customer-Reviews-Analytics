B006VFLIYK|5.0|I love David Baldacci's books - but this one by far is the best!  Very action packed - I couldn't put it down.  If you like Lee Child's Jack Reacher series, you should like this.
B001MVYUPC|5.0|Acting , Direction ,screenplay , costumes ... There were no weaknesses in this film . As I remember ... This was up against a number of excellent movies including  \\" E.T. the Extraterrestial \\" . Fans were stunned the E.T. didn't win ... Gandhi was a quiet great movie . I saw it by accident years ago and it has become one of my favorite films since .<br /><br />  It is long ... There are no car chases or photon torpedo's ... Just the story of one of the most remarkable men of all time . Watch the movie ... you won't be sorry .
030758836X|2.0|I'm not a fan of pop fiction but after many glowing recommendations I gave Gone Girl a try. I found nothing to like (or learn from) in this twisted \\"love\\" story between two unlikable flawed characters in an uninteresting setting.  On a positive note, it kept me reading right to the end, often bored but still hoping.  The concept had potential so I hung in there, trusting, amusing myself with thoughts of how the story could twist and/or turn and end up meaningful or interesting but alas, it did not happen. When I got to the last line, I turned the page to start the next chapter only to realize that it was over.  It was an unsatisfying, irritating non-ending!  After 480 pages, the characters did not evolve other than being more forthcoming with one another about their psychological shortcomings.  In addition, had I read the author's acknowlegement section (many pages, on and on with cutsy in-jokes etc), I would not have chosen the book.  The only thing that might have saved this book is if it had been hilariously funny.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|As many have stated this is a great movie but i thought I'd mention the audio quality on the blu ray.The 7/1 sound is just awesome and was actually better than in the cinema.If you are lucky enough to have a room big enough for 7 speakers this movie makes adding the extra 2 worth the effort as it just pushes all 7 speakers to the extreme and the base just makes you feel the sound that much more.If you were wondering how I was able to post this before the U.S release date, is i bought the blu ray in Australia and it was released a month earlier.Can't wait for the next one as I'm sure with the success of this there will be many more.Bring it on

159514188X|5.0|Thirteen Reasons Why is a compelling novel by Jay Asher about a young man who mysteriously receives a box of tapes. This box of thirteen tapes contains the life story of the young Hannah Baker who has just recently committed suicide. These tapes have been sent around to everyone on Hannah's list of people that contributed to her demise. Driven by fear and the threat of Hannah Baker having the tapes released to the public, Clay Jensen begins to listen to all of the tapes. At times Clay finds the contents of the tapes to be humorous and at times they are heart wrenching. Overall this book will keep you on the edge of your seat, always guessing what, and who, Hannah will be talking about in the next tape.  I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who enjoys coming-of-age novels.
B0061Q13V2|5.0|This book is well written and easy to read. One would never know that behind those big beautiful eyes there was so much pain. She was the best of the best at what she did, yet it was never good enough for her parents or coaches (The Karolyis). Like everything, gymnastics has its ugly politics and corruptness. To handle everything she did as gracefully as she did makes her a hero. She turned out a well balanced and beautiful woman. She was a gymnast, but anyone who has ever been pushed to excel at something will get something from her story.<br /><br />Dominique, thank you for your story and being brave enough to tell it. I was never a gymnast, but can relate to you on so many levels. You are an inspiration. God Bless you and your family.

B004JN1D2I|4.0|After spending a summer in Haiti after the 2012 Earthquake, I returned home not knowing a whole lot about this new HBO series. In fact, I had never hear of the books either, but my father in law was there when I got home and got me spun up on it. After watching the series on TV, I got hooked which is was surprising at the time since I normally like to spend time doing other things and not glued to a tv set. The one of my co-workers suggested I read the books instead, and I followed his advice. Now I want to advice any who reads this review to do as I did since you will find out a lot more that is left out of the from the TV series.  This books are very addictive, one you read a chapter it is going to be very hard to put the book down since you will want to know more and more.  I will leave it at that since I do not want to spoil it for anyone. BLUF, I you can't wait until HBO airs out the following season to Game of Thrones, you need to start reading.  These books are awesome.
B003VANOFY|2.0|The headset arrived well Packaged by amazon and no damage was noticed when received.<br />Pros: very good sound and the 7.1 surround sound is great. I will only be buying 7.1 for now on. Comfortable.<br /><br />Cons: the mic has horrid quality. I play video games with my friends a lot and they hate how I sound on the mic. I use a $20 mic from an old headset now and mute the Logitech. The wireless is another con because it can lose connection even when sitting still at the computer. I am not near any devices that cause interference also.<br /><br />Overall it just has great sound and comfort, but the mic is horrible and sound does cut out when losing connection making it worthless for gamers in my opinion. I would not suggest buying this for gaming.

B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Beautiful Disaster is most definitely one of the best books I have ever read!!  I literally had to stay up all night to finsh it; I couldn't put it down.  Granted, I like almost every book I read, but I love this one so much that I have become completely obsessed with it.  I loved how it starts off right away with Travis showing a particular interest in Abby, and as the book goes on it shows how the hate she has for him develops into friendship, and then into something more. Of course, there is certain content in this book that isn't for young readers, but it's that one book I'm forcing all of my friends to read.  I seriously can't wait to read Walking Disaster (already have the due date marked on my ipod calendar) :) and I am freaking out hoping that Beautiful Disaster will become a movie too!! xxoo

B0041B785Y|5.0|As many reviews at Amazon note ( and I have to agree with all of them ), at this time Meshuggah has returned to their 90s tech-thrash roots, when they've  released two ultra heavy post-apocalyptic poli-rhythms based efforts: Destroy Erase Improve and Chaosphere, perhaps two of the finest metal albums ever released. I simply love every album of them released in 2000s, specially Obzen, which already hinted the direction they would follow, but Koloss is my favorite Meshuggah since Chaosphere...<br /><br />Total brutal, insane and quite extreme metal. A MetallicA with brains put on acid. Some of the most awesome metal riffs ever written. At the same time, Meshuggah is able to reach a contemplative state, something almost like a mantra, something that grabs your mind and soul and takes you somewhere inside  your self.<br /><br />And it is pure metal. That is perhaps my favorite part..
B008MG1E4A|1.0|Disclaimer first: I am a veteran of the U.S. Army. I served in Afghanistan during '09-'10 as a combat medic in support of Operation Enduring Freedom.<br /><br />This book is a classic example of just what a great agent/publicity department can do for a wholly unremarkable work if it catches the world at just the right time. For those looking for the cliff's notes, here goes: If you've read/seen the \\"leaked\\" blurbs of this book on the news, then you've got all the \\"juicy\\" secrets this book has to offer. There's no bomb shells here and the writing is at times discursive. After reading this book one thing is patently obvious: Matt is a man with a COLOSSAL ego. This book is all about Matt: Matt's heroism; Matt's struggles; Matt's accomplishments; Matt's great shooting; and ultimately what appears to be Matt's grudge against Team 6. As a former soldier to other soldiers I would say this is a book \\"all about me instead of we\\" from a guy who clearly feels that way. Does Matt reveal details that will jeopardize future operations? In my unprofessional opinion, unlikely. But is Matt a Blue Falcon (military for Buddy f'er)? You betcha. Now to my review.<br /><br />Matt appears to be a guy with an axe to grind who ran head long into a historical event, and a corporate publishing house that knows how to turn a fast buck. Matt Bissonnette, aka Mark Owen, doesn't like President Obama. Mr. Bissonnette likely parted SEAL Team 6 on terms less than ideal by his thinking. This book is his attempt to run Team 6 through the mud in such a way as to make it impossible for them to respond without disclosing their identities. Obama is a politician after Machiavelli's heart, and Joe Biden reminds them of someone's \\"drunk uncle\\": so says Team 6, according to Mr. Bissonnette.<br />(Begin quote from book)<br />\\"You know we just put admiral's stars on Jay,\\" Walt said during the speech [President Obama informing the nation of the successful raid]. \\"And we just got this guy reelected.\\"<br />\\"Well,would you rather not have done this?\\" I said.<br />\\"We all knew the deal.\\"<br />[Here Matt decides to speak for all of Team 6; and apparently the entire SOCOM community as well]<br />\\"We were tools in their toolbox, and when things go well they promote it. They inflate their roles.\\" (end quote).<br />Such a quote serves only one purpose, and that purpose is not to \\"set the record straight\\" or \\"honor those who made it possible.\\" It's a kneecap job. Plain and simple. Just to make his intentions perfectly clear, Mr. Bissonnette delivers a coup de grace. [Obama meets with Team 6 to congratulate them. Biden is there, evidently, and makes \\"lame jokes.\\" Team 6, according to Matt, is not impressed.]<br />(Begin quote)<br />\\"I don't recall much about the speech. It was straight from the speechwriter playbook:<br />'You guys are America's best.' [Obama speaking] 'You are what America stands for.' 'Thank you from the American people.' 'Job well done.'\\"<br />(End quote)<br />After the speech Obama purportedly invites Team 6 to the White House for a beer. Walt, a fellow member of Team 6, just \\"smirks.\\" Sometime later Matt realizes that the \\"invite\\" hasn't come and says to Walt.<br />(Begin quote)<br />\\"Hey, did you ever hear anything about that beer,\\" I asked.<br />Walt's smirk was back.<br />\\"You believed that sh@!,\\" [profanity altered], he said. \\"I bet you voted for change too, sucker.\\"<br />(end quote).<br />Two things: One, as a former soldier, what is said in uniform, stays in uniform. Two, \\"outing\\" the supposed political opinions of men who cannot respond is beyond the pale, and beneath a former SEAL. That's not setting the record straight. That's trying to ruin others reputations. Sounds like there's bad blood between Matt and Team 6. And really, there's nothing more to the book. I shelled out 13 bucks for it. As a former soldier and a veteran of Afghanistan, I would have bought this book no matter what the reviews were. My recommendation to those out there is to take a pass. Really, it's poorly written and there's nothing groundbreaking here AT ALL. Just a pissed off former SEAL looking for some cheap payback.<br /><br />Edit: So here's what I think are two fair and well thought out points brought up by comments on this review.<br />1. Are you an Obama supporter? Is that your beef?<br />2. What's the big deal with Matt talking about soldier's supposed political view points? Don't they have the right to speak their minds. And Matt is out of uniform, so why can't he talk about other soldiers?<br />I'll take question two first because it will answer #1 in my opinion.<br />Do soldiers have the right to speak their minds while in uniform? I'll try to keep my answer as brief as possible. First the one word reply, NO. Now the reason. Suppose the military decided tomorrow that Obama shouldn't be president. How would We The People go about stopping them? Do you think a rifle in the hands of a civilian is a match for a main battle tank commanded by a trained soldier? What stops the men and women in uniform from overthrowing our civilian government isn't a fear of the Second Amendment, it's a sense of honor and duty. Maybe that sounds corny to you, but that's the gist of it. There are millions of people, right now, in this world living under a military junta. Our military is hands down the strongest in the world. We The People are no match for it.<br />Now I'll expand on that idea. Suppose Obama wins the upcoming election. To be frank, I hope he loses. But suppose he wins. Suppose another mission comes up with another high value target. That's not far fetched at all. What if Obama is sitting in the White House and being briefed on the assets available? Delta Force says they can do the job; the Navy says its SEALs are up to the task. What if Obama picks Delta Force? What if, only for a tenth of a second, Obama thinks \\"Would the SEALs burn me down?\\" Is that something we want any president to think? Do you want the president worried that the military plays favorites? Now suppose Obama rises above it and picks Delta simply because they are best for the job. What do you think the admiral in charge of the SEALs that just lost the mission would think? \\"This is because my SEALs can't keep their mouths shut. Obama didn't pick my guys because my guys said they hate Obama.\\"<br />These two ideas: that the military must never dominate the civilian government; and that the politicians must never come to think the military plays favorites, or would act to damage a politician, are well understood and vital to our democracy. Ask Gen McChrystal and Gen MacArthur and Gen Fuller what happens when a soldier gets near that line. So what's my point? Matt knows this. Every soldier knows this. Ask yourself this: What is something like, \\"I bet you voted for change too, sucker,\\" doing in a book that's supposed to be about the Osama mission? To me the answer is clear. Matt used America's interest in hearing anything new about the mission (of which there's nothing here) as cover to tag his old teammates as Obama haters. That tag will stick with them and the SEAL community for a while. It will damage their careers. In my opinion, that was the ONLY reason this book was written. He could have waited until after the election. That's just two months away. Why publish now? This book does maximum damage in a close election by making it look like the military is bias.

At times throughout the book I was a bit confounded as to the actions of the characters, but it ended up being worth it.  The only reason I didn't give it a 5 was that I thought the ending, while great, needed a bit more explanation.

0812550706|2.0|This was one of two books that everyone recommended when I was on a commuter train and found myself seated around a bunch of bookworms. I followed their advice and picked up both books.<br /><br />I was quite bored with the story and characters. The word \\"ingenious\\" has been used to describe this story yet it is really nothing more than a series of training drills with one surprise. I did not find that a plot twist made up for the process.  I might have liked it when I was 10 years old. For the most part it seems like a book that would appeal to kids, boys more than girls of course. The premise requires that you either suspend judgement of plausibility or are too young to know the absurdity. Unfortunately I was already 40 when I read it. I am amazed at the number of fans this series has acquired. At the right time of your life it may hit you in such a way you never forget or stop appreciating it.<br /><br />The other book recommended was George R.R. Martin's Game of Thrones. I would not have been interested in the Fantasy genre had I not heard the compelling opinions of this group. I eventually read all of The Ice and Fire series up to the bloated stage. I have only been discouraged from continuing with it since. A couple of other great authors I have discovered are Robin Hobb and Patrick Rothfus.
B001DF68MA|4.0|Carrying your baby in the front of the bike where you can see them and talk to them is much better than the back. They can get into all kinds of trouble back there. Especially having less to look at, they'll get bored. Babies love to interact with people you pass as you ride, and they can look up and see your face. If there's a problem with the straps or anything, you can see it and fix it.<br /><br />You have to be aware that they can mess with your brakes or push your handlebar with their hands and feet, so take the time to get used to it before doing anything ambitious. Even under the best conditions, your attention will always be divided between riding your bike and what your kid is doing, so you have to think about the inherent risk.<br /><br />Having spent time with both, I prefer the WeeRide LTD to a seat that mounts on the handlebars. It's more stable, especially when on the kickstand. You still can't walk away from the bike with the kid in the seat, but at least the kickstand will hold it up. I recommend using this in combination with a Click-Stand folding bike stand.<br /><br />The sleeping pad works great. The main reason I wanted to try this seat was that the iBert Safe-T-Seat I had didn't support the baby when she went to sleep, so she just slumped over. Apparently the newer iBerts have this feature.<br /><br />With a seat that pushes their legs right up under your handlebar, it's also a problem to stuff the baby's feet under the handlebars in seats like the iBert, and even more of a problem to get the kid out of the seat when you stop. You wish you had three hands. Only a high-rise handlebar avoids this problem with the iBert.<br /><br />The massive steel rail of the WeeRide that mounts to the steering head and the seat tube is way too heavy, but it's very simply made and probably can be replaced with some aluminum stock. Keep in mind that you need some clearance to attach this rail above your top tube. If your head tube is flush, the WeeRide won't work at all. The head tube should stick up above the top tube at least 1/4\\" to just squeak by; I'd look for more like 3/8\\" to be certain. Go to WeeRide's web site and download the PDF instructions and read them so you know how this is supposed to work before you buy.<br /><br />The straps and the buckle on the LTD are better than some, but like most car seats and other baby seat belts, they're a pain. I use a Bongo Tie as a chest strap so seat's straps don't fall down off their shoulders.<br /><br />The other trade off with this type of child seat is that it fills up the space between your handlebars and saddle, so you probably won't be able to stand over the top tube. You have to lower your seat post a bit and stand on your toes while on your saddle, unless your top tube is extra long and you and adjust your saddle very far back. In addition, because the child seat is near your knees, you will probably have to spread your knees a bit wide as you pedal. It works, but if you tried to ride fifty miles that way it might be really uncomfortable. This seat is appropriate for slow rides of only a few miles.<br /><br />The bottom line is, will you and your kid want to use this -- or any -- bike seat? It depends on you and your kid. Borrow a seat if you can and see if it's something you're into before spending any money.k at all.

0307951529|5.0|A partner and I have been running a handmade bookbinding business for the past year and a half, and we have definitely been learning as we go. This book showed me that while we're doing a lot of things right, there are lots of EASY things that we can be doing WAY better to help our business grow.<br /><br />Since reading The $100 Startup, we're making our website customer-focused (vs. us-focused), building up partnerships with other small businesses (printers and photographers we already know), and  NOT spending money unless we can make a quick return on investment. These things seem simple, but I had been bogged down in my day-to-day and overlooking them. The examples in this book were inspiring and eye-opening, and helped shed light on areas I needed to improve. I love how Chris keeps things simple, and I love that I feel like I'm on a first-name basis with him by the end of the book.

0345803485|2.0|I really wanted to like this book. I bought it because I heard it had been banned from our local public library so of course normal human curiosity took over (I haven't confirmed that but it's Gwinnett County, GA, in case anyone's wondering). And the writer at least had the courage to write erotica involving activities considering \\"kinky\\" by many, if not most, people. So that's why I gave two stars instead of one.<br /><br />But the characters are completely unlikeable and that always ruins a story for me. Anastasia Steele is immature, boring, and has an appallingly low level of self-esteem. She also seems to have a bit of a gold-digger side to her - yuck. Worst of all (because this is an erotic story) she's a VIRGIN!? Really?! What's wrong with a female character whose had a little life experience and yes, sexual experience? I don't mean she has to be with hundreds of men but a handful at least, and be old enough to know what she wants. Heck, this girl doesn't even know who she is, let alone what she wants. I actually thought the roommate was slightly more interesting.<br /><br />And Christian Grey? He's not a dominant; he's a narcissist. Yes, women like confidence but we don't like arrogance. Or at least, we don't if we have any self-esteem. And his great love for her doesn't in the least appear to be based on an actual understanding of Anastasia as a person. She's just a fantasy to him. He loves her for what she is willing to put up with.<br /><br />Speaking of what she's willing to put up with, if you are going to write a sadomasochistic story, why not pair the sadist with someone who really is a true sexual masochist and not just someone going along for it out of \\"love\\"? I put love in quotes because the story is really about infatuation and not what I would consider love. I really think a better story would have involved characters who were a little bit older, with more life and sexual experience, a male character with more balanced personality, a female character with...well, a personality and a female character who actually enjoyed the new experiences because she was a good match for him. This pair was far too unmatched and far too unlikeable.

The difference in sound quality when lisenting to FLAC and ALAC audio files with this device is more than I could have hoped for.

B004LWZW6U|3.0|As one can see by looking at the balance of review numbers from 5-1 stars this film is pretty contradictory in nature. There are some great,surreal moments and some truly awful ones .<br />The story is your basic bad ,greedy entrepreneur does something illegal that lets the monsters out.<br />It has a lot of t and a in it and the usual flock of 20-somethings waiting to be slaughtered.<br />Overall it's well done and a lot of fun with David Hasselhoff being very funny in his cameo.<br />The bad guy isn't nearly as slimy as the one in the last film which is good because it made the movie less enjoyable.
B007SGM084|5.0|Enjoyed the trilogy so much I cried when it ended.  Got so involved with the characters and their growth thru the books.  And of course the sex scenes were awesome and touching. Would love to read more from this author.

B004DI7HZ6|5.0|Thought this book was a great read. Took a couple of days to finish only because I had to work. The development of the charators and the visual picture of the settings made it tough to put down. My only disappointment was when the book ended because I knew I had to wait almost a year for the next one. I bought the 2nd one in hard cover the day it came out. Read that and enjoyed it as much with the same disappointment only because it ended. Then I wanted to read this again because it had been so long but I could not remember who I loned it to last. I bought it again, but for my kindle this time. Then read both this and the 2nd straight through. She is a terrific writter. It is a great story with vivid visual discriptions that are 2nd to none. I would recommend this book and have to many of my friends and family.
0452289963|5.0|Although I liked this book very much the first time I read it a few years ago, it was on the second reading this year that I deeply connected with what Eckhart Tolle is sharing about the extraordinary times we are living through, wherein \\"consciousness is awakening from the dream of form.\\" Perhaps it is the rising energy of 2012 that lends greater significance to his words. At any rate, I found A New Earth to be one of the best books I've read about what some have called the Great Shift in awareness on our planet. Tolle's analysis is at times conceptually dense, which some might find hard to make their way through. (Stick with it; it's worth it!) I myself wished for a little more personal, emotional content when I first read it, but that is not really his style. As I reread the book, I was so inspired that my own feelings carried me on a wave of enthusiasm and epiphany right to the last word in the last chapter. Outstanding and truly visionary!<br />Peggy Kornegger<br />author of Living with Spirit, Journey of a Flower Child
0345803485|3.0|This is your typical romance fantasy though with more sex scenes than imaginable, and it's way too repetitive. The idea that it should make any sense isn't even on the drawing board so readers should dispense with that notion immediately.  Then again that isn't the object of the book.  Though whatever that object is can be found in the heart of the reader.  Let's just say that it has a healthy enough dose of kinky, B&D, and S&M sex for whatever that portion of the romance novel market is that dances to that tune.<br /><br />I finished book one because I don't like to comment on a book if I haven't at least read it thru, but it took some persistance.  One has to be an ardent reader of this oueuvre' to tolerate the repretitive use of the author's \\"holy crap\\" type of dialogue; but quite obviously, from the success of this novel, many are out there.<br /><br />Like most of these novels it's written by a woman.  That is, a man would never select these types of descriptive phrases and pile them in the proper places like a women would and in this case does.  It was a kick to read it in one way because it was downright goofy as to its story line and if you either have two of everything or no sex life at all and want to get started, this could appeal to your most prurient of interests.<br /><br />Knock yourself out!
B0000041Z5|5.0|This would have to be narrowly my favourite performance of the Brahms symphonies for both the passion of the interpretations and the magnificent playing of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. These performances, and those by the Philadelphia Orchestra conducted by Riccardo Muti, manage to combine the impressive power of the full orchestra with tender lyricism in the quieter sections, like the adagio 2nd movement in the 1st Symphony and the `andante' 2nd movement of the 3rd Symphony - so lyrical it was made into a popular song that Mario Lanza recorded. This 4 CD set also includes the intense Tragic Overture and the Academic Festival Overture that date from 1880, composed between the 2nd and 3rd Symphonies. This is a fine, uplifting account of Brahms' orchestral music.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000007ODY Brahms: The Complete Symphonies / Karajan, Berlin PO]]
B005H9B44A|4.0|Thor is a movie that has to be looked at on a number of levels. The action and effects is outstanding. The movie scenes are rich in design and colors projecting an art deco version of Valhalla. The action scenes are loaded with drama and in some cases with elements of humour. What is unexpected is underlying theme of loss and redemption, a raw callous youth coming to understand responsibility is all about. Thor's banishment to Earth, his realization of loss, and his redemption through being to willing to sacrifice his life to preserve planet is a theme one does not expect in a live action comic book. Thor works on all levels. There may be a few problems with the script and some parts that should have gone on the cutting room floor but overall a very enjoyable flic.
B004HW7JMO|5.0|Incredible series... The effects are much more realistic with each passing season. This is the great back story to crixus and his ascension to glory, as well as the ascension of the house of Batiatus..

0425263908|2.0|Sorry girls .......love sex and romance as well as anyone.  However I only made it to the first four chapters, everyone is beautiful, hot, rich and hung !  Too perfect for me.  Haven't you ever met someone that was just average but sexy as hell !  And you couldn't figure out the attraction but you knew you were hooked.  Now that's a story !  I became very turned off because it seemed the driving factor was who's going to get layed and how often.  Maybe I shouldn't be writing a review without finishing the book but it wasn't  for me......... Just my thoughts.  GH

B0025UHKNS|1.0|I really needed something good for my distance running and did a lot of research before settling on purchasing this Garmin.  This is a great watch, in itself - a little complicated to master at first, but then was fine.  The major problem is that the strap is not good if you've a small wrist.  To get it tight enough requires a little pull to get it through the slot... and within six months, the strap itself broke.  I had it replaced - NOT CHEAP.  Then two weeks ago, less than six months after new strap was put on, it came apart at vital connection points on the watch.<br /><br />My husband purchased this for me for over $250, another sum for repair and new strap... and it ended up in the trash a year later.  I've gone back to a simpler, cheaper time/distance-only model with a flexible, lasting strap.
B008MEM24S|5.0|I bought this game because I enjoyed &quot;Where's My Water?&quot; Honestly, I half expected it to be a licensed clone but was pleasantly surprised to see that it has its own set of challenges. Between this and another franchise about flying, destructive birds, I have no time to waste on other things. It's a very fun game and well worth the money.
0345803485|5.0|I must disagree with the people who gave this bad ratings.  I'm a serious reader and this book had my mouth gapping open at the pool.  Christian Grey has made me want to date again.  Yes, I know he's fictional, but OMG.  Women of America have made this trilogy #1 all summer, and with good reason.  Obviously we American women are missing a big part of life when we get so caught up in these characters.  Men, sit up and take notice.  Bring some excitement back to your wives or girlfriends life.  Of course not every many could pull off the Grey character.  Only a certain type could do this well.  I dread finishing the last book.  Then what????<br />The only problem I have had with the books is the quality of the actual book.  The pages fall out.  Why was this so cheaply made when clearly we will want to keep these books and re read them.  But over 170 pages have fallen out of book 1.  For Random House to have published them I must way the binding (ha ha) is very bad.  Can I get a hole puncher and make my own book from the pages that are falling out.  Other than the physical quality of the book, the content, writing and idea behind these books would bring any woman alive again.  THANK YOU E.L. JAMES!!!!!<br /><br />And I really hope Matt Bomer plays the part of Christian Grey in the movie.  While reading the book it's his face I see............perfect.

B005Q1W10A|5.0|I love this series! I was a little late jumping on the bandwagon with this one and I tried to catch up through my local tv listings. I got frustrated and ended up ordering both seasons on DVD. Totally worth the money. We've watched both seasons at least 3 times now.

0525953728|5.0|In No Easy Day, you see an account of the raid to capture or kill Osama Bin Laden from the eyes on someone who was there - one of four team leaders on the ground that night. The account is most definitely gripping, I could not put it down and I skipped sleeping to finish it - yes, there will be hell to pay at work tomorrow.  But, nowhere close to as much hell as the operators in DevGru (aka Seal Team 6) undertook to get into DevGru and to stay there.<br /><br />The first  thing that struck me was just how elite a team the US sent on that raid. To be a member of DevGru you have to ALREADY be a Navy Seal. Most who apply don't make it, but they go back to being a \\"regular\\" SEAL which has nothing regular about it. For the Bin Laden raid, they essentially assembled an All Star team of the most seasoned DevGru operators from multiple teams and put them together on a team consisting of the best of the best of the best.<br /><br />My next takeaway on the actual raid itself was how many things actually went wrong.  Here you have the best of the best taking part in a historic mission, and all kinds of things start falling apart. Yet, amazingly (to me), despite all the problems, it still worked out. Thats because everything that could have gone wrong was previously anticipated, contingency plans made, and all back up plans were rehearsed multiple times.  While I considered the mission to be successful, the impression I get is the members of DevGru thought they could have done it much better. (I'll leave out the details as to avoid spoiling the story).<br /><br />This leads me to my next takeaway which is just how devoted to perfection and exceptional performance these operators seem to be. One thing that surprised me is how much they train when they aren't deployed. If they aren't jumping out of helicopters on a real mission, they are jumping out of real helicopters for practice. The missions are abroad and the training sessions are state side but often away from home too.<br /><br />In short, these guys don't ever seem to be at home very much, it just takes that much work and training to be as good as these guys are. I for one am glad they are on OUR side and my appreciation for them has certainly gone way up after reading this book,<br /><br />No Easy Day very much gives you a view into both the Bin Laden raid but also the years and in some cases decades of demanding work that led up to it... And the title IS accurate, there doesn't seem to be ANY easy days as a member of DevGru.<br /><br />Overall a gripping story on the Bin Laden raid with excellent perspective on the life of the operators in DevGru (Seal Team 6)./><br />In short, these guys don't ever seem to be at home very much, it just takes that much work and training to be as good as these guys are.

0385737947|2.0|I admit that I am only partially through this book, but I have to agree with the majority of the readers on here that it is sloppily written and the main characters are not even likeable.  Thomas is a whiny, irritating ass that I have found myself asking \\"what the hell???\\" over and over again at his actions and reactions to what he learns/discovers about the Glade.  He needs to act like the hero he is supposed to be and not someone you wish were killed off in chapter one.  IJS.
030758836X|3.0|I won't bother recapping what this book is about.  There are over 1,000 other reviews (plus you definitely don't want any spoilers on this one!).  I'll just let you know what I personally thought about the book... Gone Girl is an exciting read, with twists and turns around every corner although it is VERY DARK.  I personally did not care for it.  Both of the main characters are vile, and have zero redeeming qualities.  Half way through the book I was sick and disturbed, but I couldn't put it down.  So that in and of itself is a selling point.  If you're into dark thrillers, I think you'd love this book.<br /><br />Despite not liking the book, I gave it 3 stars because it IS very engrossing, just not my cup of tea.

0312641893|4.0|Humans and Androids are common in the city of New Beijing. Earth is being ravaged by a terrible plague. The answer may reside with the lunars, the ruthless species in the moon. Cinder is a mechanic, and a cyborg. Her body is part human and part mechanical. She is a second class citizen with very little rights and servant like status. When Prince Kai suddenly arrived at her shop asking her to fix his android, things forever change for Cinder. She becomes tangled in a web of conspiracies, war and the plague.<br /><br />Cinder, by Marissa Meyer, is a modern re-telling of the classic Cinderella. Cinder is a great character. She is far from perfect. Her body is literally not entirely human. She has a shitty life. She is a servant. And her only friends are an android and her step sister. The classic Cinderella had it better. But, I loved Cinder. She was smart, capable and independent. She was a greatly written heroine that is extremely likable.<br /><br />Kai, well...he was a boy and CInder is a girl...you make the math. Other than that, he wasn't that memorable or even that omnipresent in the plot.<br /><br />The plot was a rush. i could not get through the pages fast enough. Times like this is when i wish I was a speed reader. There were elements of cyberpunks, other races, plagues. The usual cyberpunk, post apocalyptic-ish story. But, this one is very well told. I highly recommend. I cannot wait until Scarlet, the next in the series because this book ends in quite the cliffhanger.
B003VANOFY|2.0|The headset itself is fairly nice. The earcups are large enough not to touch the ears whatsoever, and the general build quality is satisfactory. The \\"push up to mute\\" feature of the mic is nice, however the indicator light to show that it is muted is not visible while wearing the headset. The range is rather impressive. In most environments you will not see anywhere near 40 feet, but it is still better than most headsets.<br /><br />The Problem:<br />Driver drivers drivers. I managed to get the drivers installed and the headset working, however that is as far as it went. The software to emulate surround sound and tweak the equalizer would not open and the Logitech Gaming Software did not detect the headset's presence even though it was functioning. I troubleshooted(troubleshot?) this for an entire weekend with no improvement. I tried FAQ steps from Logitech as well as numerous suggestions from online forums. This is apparently a common problem based on the number of posts. I tried newer drivers, older drivers, uninstalling my sound card, disabling other sound devices, etc etc etc but nothing produced any useful results. Other reviews state that the sound quality of this headset is very good, but that it requires EQ tweaking. Since I was unable to access the EQ, the sound quality was actually very poor.<br /><br />The battery life is advertised as \\"up to 10 hours.\\" This probably is with the sound muted and the mic disabled. I got less than five hours, and there was no warning when the headset died. That you can use the headset while charging is a great feature, I just wish that it would give a warning so that it could be plugged in before it got to that point. I did see somewhere that the software monitors the charge, so perhaps it would have been different if that functions.<br /><br />I have ordered a Steelseries Siberia V2, and will be returning the Logitech as soon as it arrives. It is a real shame that such a nice piece of hardware can be rendered inoperable byfaulty drivers.

B002JVWR9U|5.0|I remember hearing about a show being made based on my favorite L.J. Smith books and I was skeptical. I didn't think it would be good and I felt it was being shoved out due to the popularity of Twilight. YUCK! I didn't watch it until I came across this amazing parody video made by The Hillywood show. For some reason it made me want to watch the show, and so that's what I did.<br /><br />My first impression based on the first couple episodes was exactly how I thought I would feel. The beginning of the first episode seemed to me to be a very cheesy scene from a horrible horror movie. The exclusion of characters I knew from the books and the inclusion of different characters taking their place was a bit upsetting for me but I got over it eventually. I slowly watched through the episodes, getting severely disappointed with the Twilight insert during one scene, and after about five episodes through I actually started to get into the show. I've just finished watching the first season and absolutely LOVED it!<br /><br />The actors and actresses are great, and I really love what they did with Elena, making her a more likable person. The story line change is great too. Personally, I loved the first four books and didn't find them boring at all. But the show definitely makes it ten times better!

068987149X|3.0|I've purchased several Eric Carle books over the last few years with my older son who is currently 3.5 years old.  We like the artwork and the usually positive messages.<br /><br />This book doesn't disappoint in the artwork, although I wish the tiny seed had been more obvious somehow from the rest.  And this book does ultimately have a positive message that even a tiny seed can grow into the biggest flower of all.  But it gets to this message in a weird way- sort of a survival of the fittest but this fit seed stays on a middle path.  For example, it doesn't fly too high because the seed that did caught fire (Icarus reference by the way, right?).  Or the one that flew in the wind too low near the water which drowned.  So I'm not sure about this- I want my son to try to fly high and to take chances.  And although I want him to do this within reason, I'm not sure a younger child can pick up on this subtle lesson.  I'm even conflicted about this and not sure it was the intended message.  (By the way, it says Age 2 and up on the description for this item)<br /><br />But what bothers me more is the use of strong, intense words for the fate of the other seeds.  One is said to die, another drowns, another catches fire.  My son is very sensitive to emotions and feelings.  He picked up early on this as what I believe is part of his own nature.  And he recently learned the word \\"kill\\" from a trip to grandma's house (she didn't know the difference between Nickelodeon and Nick Jr!) and somewhere else about death (I think it is from the goldfish he buried at another trip to grandma's house!  Don't worry they love him and just forgot what kids are like since he is their first grandchild, but they are remembering!).  So the fate of these seeds was a little intense.  Although I did explain why it caught fire, I've so far chosen not to use the drowned word or the died word.  I say something like they cannot grow (which is language from another part of the book too).<br /><br />The end of the story is positive as the tiny seed that became the biggest more beautiful flower now sheds its seeds into the wind continuing the cycle of life.  Of course, my son's first reaction was sadness that the flower lost its petals.  So we talked about this and it was a good discussion about how life and nature is a cycle.<br /><br />So overall, I believe this book means to send positive messages.  But it may lead to some discussion and initial confusion in a child who is sensitive.

B007VGXS8M|5.0|Good app, great value, worth the money. I gave it four stars because I feel like I'm giving out too many five stars. I know that's a stupid reason. Okay fine I'll change it to five. Sheeshio.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|Usually I hate apps that are more than a dollar, but this app is just outstanding. Drawing Pad gives you the full art experience without the mess! Truly a very well put together app. I strongly reccomend this for everyone.Even if you are into art or not, you won't regret buying this app.
B008MEM24S|3.0|I guess it's okay, but not much different from Where's My Water? Same thing, Disney is just trying to pick up some more money. Same with Temple Run Brave. Why pay 99 cents when you can get the same thing for free?!?

0307592731|1.0|One of the worst books I've read in a long time.  The author was a complete trainwreck at the beginning of the hike.  Unfortunately, she was just as much of a mess at the end of the hike.  I kept waiting for words of wisdom learned, so I finished the book.  There were none.  There was no moment for her when she pulled herself together.  She now has 2 children, which is the scariest part.  She hasn't set boundaries for herself and now she's teaching young children?<br /><br />I thought the hike itself would be interesting.  Unfortunately, every time you turn a page, she's hitchhiking.  I know people who have done the entire trail.  They were responsible and planned well.  Cheryl was so irresponsible I actually considered if she made things up to have the book sell.  Nobody could really be so foolish to have created such bad situations for themselves.<br /><br />Don't waste your money.  There are too many great books about real life situations about people who have accomplished great things.  The best part of this book was the title.
0525953728|5.0|Well,  it would appear as though the media, government and certain individuals have completely blown this book out of proportion when it comes to any \\"secrets\\" the book would reveal.  The fact is, that the author himself, states at the very beginning, all information contained herein is from public sources and conversations he could recall.  He even warns, that if you are looking for secrets, then this isn't the book for you.<br /><br />Did anyone ever mention the fact that he hired a Special Ops attorney to review the book to ensure it was free from \\"forbidden\\" topics and information.  No.  Did they mention he wanted to become a SEAL after he read a book portraying the SEAL life called, Men in Green Faces by Gene Wentz?  No.  Typical hysteria before anyone can even read and absorb what is written by him.<br /><br />I'm glad he wrote it, have the confidence that nothing was \\"leaked\\" in this book that can be used against our great country which these SEALs fight to protect everyday.  Including our ability to write books such as these.<br /><br />Great read and I'm glad I own a piece of history and have a much higher respect for all in the military now.
B008Z9YLV2|1.0|NOTE: I have not read the book(s). I am hopeful they are superior to this yawner. Tweens, teens and teens-at-heart might enjoy the movie. I have no idea why.<br /><br />Give this slick, polished, visually above-average (but not enough to save it) movie a miss and watch the vastly-superior, MUCH more violent Japanese \\"Battle Roayale.\\"<br /><br />Seventy minutes into the movie another person watching it awoke with a start. \\"What'd I miss?\\" was the question. A ten-second review ending with \\"and now they're gonna start hunting each other\\" elicited a snort of derision from the sleeper. \\"Wake me when it gets good,\\" we were told. Our friend was able to slumber on undisturbed for another hour before it being roused for a cup of tea to accompany the closing credits. We had debated at exactly three points as to whether the action was sufficient to cause us to waken our buddy but as the action ended quickly and the point was rendered moot. It wasn't even determined to be interesting enough to review on appeal!<br /><br />I wish I could have those two hours back. I regret the waste of three hundred ninety nine pennies to rent this from Amazon.<br /><br />If you've read this far I expect it means you probably hated the movie. If you're under 16, you'll enjoy it.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|To me, this book was romantic porn. I stopped reading it. The guy named Gray is twisted. For some reason women like it. Go figure.
B0086700CM|5.0|absolutely love this game!!!!!!!!!!! Works great on my kindle fire!!!Addictive.  can play for hours love it recommend. it to every one
B009329ZF2|1.0|I cannot possibly list all the scenes in this movie that are apt to make a person puke.  Yes, there are aliens that are pretty cool.  Sure, there's neat battle scenes.  But everything in between makes you feel like you're being slapped in the face with a ham sandwich.  It is Pearl Harbor with aliens.  And if you didn't catch it in the credits, I believe the number you're supposed to call after watching that film is 1-800-GO NAVY.  As a bonus for signing up they'll give you a ipod full of AC/DC songs.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|Homeland is a smart show. Really smart. It does everything right. In terms of plot, it quickly ensnares the audience in a seemingly simple situation that gets evermore involved, complicated and detailed. There isn't really a single episode that lags or drags and it rapidly exhibits a mastery in how to engage the viewer. It's a hugely addictive season that has the best elements of The Killing and Damages without ever yielding to the obvious or convenient.<br /><br />The casting could not be better. There are also some complex threads running in a story that combine everything demanded of a show like this: political drama, family life, teen stress and over-arching themes of what's right, what's practical and what really happens. It meshes together perfectly and consistently executes to interest, surprise and question the viewer.<br /><br />I don't want to give away any part of the plot since it's best consumed without knowing much about where it's going. The lead characters shine in their roles and I'm once again wondering why it's so hard for mainstream movies to understand how they do this. If you enjoy quality TV dramas such as The Killing and The Walking Dead, you'll be glued to this story. And I really do hope that regular film figures out the trick soon.
0525953728|5.0|I give my utmost respect to Mark Bissonnette for what he did and the stand that he takes today. Mark said, \\"We all knew the deal. We were tools in the toolbox, and when things go well they promote it. They inflate their roles,\\"<br /><br />It was said even more distinctly and vividly in David Mulldune's book,  The Mailman Went UA (A Vietnam Memoir). Author Jack Flynn wrote, \\"If you were too young or too old for Vietnam and you want to know what it was like over there, this book is for you. But be 100 percent sure that you want to know the whole story, because David Mulldune's book pulls no punches and gives you the unrelenting, unvarnished truth of it. You don't like raw language? Men talking like men in war? Men acting like men in war? Then, this book isn't for you. Go get yourself a watered down, abridged version in a children's library.<br /><br />In The Mailman Went UA, David Mulldune is your real life tour guide into the bush and villages of Vietnam, but it is no Fantasy Island he takes you through. It is the day to day, moment to moment, life and death experience of a US Marine in the bush for 13 unendurable months. Mulldune puts it this way, \\"Your brain never gets a break.\\"<br /><br />Finally, the platform for the truth about military operations and the political grandstanding for personal gain comes out.
0439023513|3.0|Let me start out by saying as a whole, I really enjoyed the series. Hands down, The Hunger Games is easily my favorite book of the whole trilogy and in my opinion, the strongest. I felt like it went downhill after the first book, but not so downhill that I wish the sequels weren't written at all. I just wish that they had lived up to how I felt about the first book.<br /><br />What I found weak about Mockingjay was also what made it strong, which was withdrawn Katniss because of all the trauma she had experienced in the previous two books. Especially with what happened to Peeta, who had become her touchstone to normalcy in a sense. However, while probably realistic (I've never actually been in combat), it didn't make for the best read if that makes sense. It seemed to lack something extra--I called it a spark in my review for Catching Fire. For some reason, the story itself felt incredibly flat to me. While I couldn't not read it because I needed to find out what happened to all the characters, I didn't devour it like I did with The Hunger Games.
B0023P1D8S|2.0|This is my favorite Black Sabbath album, but I am sorely disappointed with this \\"remaster\\". It doesnt sound any better than my original. Its got a murky low sound just as it always has had.You couldnt prove to me its any better sounding.I liked the 2nd cd of extras but nothing really standout.The 1 new song was cool(thats why 2 stars)Weevil Woman. Overall the cd set is not worth the money as I think its kinda shoddy at best.....support your favorite artists...........
B00000251N|4.0|This was such a soft soundtrack with songs that really played off of the book. Neil Diamond provided a powerful voice behind the story and the music was all very soft and sweet. Great album to listen to when you just want to relax.
0525953728|5.0|Most of the one star reviews are from former or current military members. My thanks to you for you service first and foremost. Secondly, the government sold you out a long time ago. Prior to this book being written. However you probably didn't hear about it because the media doesn't want you to hear about it.    It's very simple. The white house gave unprecedented access to hollywood filmmakers to make a movie out of the raid. Detailing who was involved the number of people on the op etc. etc. and much much more information.    Don't believe me? Read about it for yourself, there was a FOIA request and all of the emails and information from these filmmakers and the DoD and White House are there. They even were given a first hand account from one of the other ST6 operators on the mission. This movie was supposed to come out in October just before the election, until it got moved back to December. I think when you read these redacted documents and then see the movie you'll see why you should be less quick to place judgement on the author of this book.    This details the FOIA request with links to the actual documents. [...]
B00884GR0W|5.0|please put this app on the free app of the day it is so good that I would play it all day but the free version wont save your worlds and what you do in them
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Absolutely loved this book, once I started I couldn't put it down! The author did a wonderful job of building the characters and plot. You will not be disappointed with this book.
B000KJT8IG|4.0|This movie has become a Christmas family tradition.  Every year when putting up decorations, we put this movie in to watch.  The movie is a classic, and you'll love it if you like Chevy Chase movies.  The Blu-Ray is a good conversion.. looks good.. much better than VHS, but hard to tell if it's much better picture quality than a DVD.  Good thing about Blu Ray is that they are scratch resistant.. so even if the picture isn't noticeably better, it should last a lot longer!
B006LSZECO|5.0|This is Gillian Flynn's best book by far. The creativity, cleverness and mystery throughout the whole book keeps you on the edge of your seat. Once you think that you have the book figured out you are thrown another curve ball. It's brilliant!
0385504209|5.0|This is one of those books that once you pick it , it is hard to put down. I enjoy reading, but don't often because I tend to quickly get bored. Every now and then one comes along that keeps my interest. This was well written, and read very quickly. It keeps your interest with action and mystery. This was the first Dan Brown book that I purchased, and it prompted me to read his other books. Great read!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Very cute game!  Get for all ages.  I have had minimal problems.  I recommend this game to all.  Come and join the fun.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I have just started using this on my kindle fire for the majority of my classes. it saves paper and is much more organized than a cluttered notebook.
0345803485|4.0|Well, I didn't hate the book, and actually I was surprised by the \\"love story\\" aspect.  Everyone has to get over the writing...it really isn't that bad. You have to think about how you talk to people and explain your stories to people, and you will realize that you speak very similar to the way the sentences are in the book. I love the way they email back and forth, and I like the internal diaglog, which is what draws me in.  Although, the one thing that is disturbing is that Grey seems to have borderline personality disorder (I am self diagnosing), so his quick turn around to love is not quite reality. The quantity of sexual relations (seriously, do people really do it that much??), in addition to an emotionally unstable man making a turn around in a matter of months, seems very unrealistic.  I am just into the second book so obviously there is a lot that I don't know about the characters and plot yet.  But if you just want to read something for guilty pleasure and not reading into it any more than that, it was an all around good read.
B0095P27DE|2.0|The Video Quality is very pixelated and blurry. I checked my internet connection and it is working fine. I tried watching another video and it looks fine. I have no idea what is going on but this sucks.
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|This app is a cool twist on Cut The Rope. There are lot more cool and fun ways to play and there are so many different levels. You cant get this version for free, but it's definitely worth the money.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Its useful and very worth the purchase. it works great and quick when  calculating. I would highly recommend this to anyone.
0525953728|5.0|Couldn't put it down. I don't know why all these people are freaking out about it. It's no different then the 2,000 other SF, SEAL, Delta, Force Recon SAS, or sniper books out there where soldiers give the first hand accounts of missions they've conducted. This guy has changed names, dates, times, so on so fourth to protect the actual classified facts of the various missions detailed in his book. It's a great story that any fan of this type of stories will really enjoy.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I have always loved Pintrest and this App has just made it so much easier to use.  I love being able to rearrange my boards and pin things while on my kindle fire.  I'm so glad that this is available now.  Great job!
0525953728|4.0|I must first say, I don't understand why the politcal stage seems to have picked this book up. It is basically a war story, just a bit more in depth, in fact almost less in depth than a discovery channel feature on Seal team six I have recently seen which basically divulges more about tactics than this book has.<br /><br />This book is good writing style and talks about some of the intense fire fights this individual and his team got into, and it does become a Tom Clancy novel after awhile, but still I find myself unable to stop reading it.<br /><br />I say, the pentagon is full of shit and has somehow turned this into political rhetoric, which is does not need to be.
034580404X|4.0|Wife loves her new set of books, its a great packaging, print, binding and cover to hold all 3 books. I can't comment of the books as I haven't read them yet, but she likes what shes read so far!
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|You can say I became addicted to the story. I've heard a lot of people hemming and hawing because of the theme of the book. But you know what to me it was like a fantasy. As much as women are independent and strive to be their own person, there is one tiny bit of us that wants to be wholly encompassed (or consumed in every way possible) by a guy. We want that bad boy with the tats who has his own fight club and is successful at it. There's something incredibly sexy with having a guy want to own you body and soul and isn't afraid to let everyone around them know it. Lot's of people will say that isn't a healthy relationship. Then again, what constitutes a healthy relationship? A peck on the cheek in the morning after coffee? Reading the newspaper with your partner before you both head off to work? Sometimes I think women want that tempestuous relationship (I know I did as teen, early 20s Had a very similar albeit dangerous relationship). Why is Twilight, 50 Shades, Bared to you so popular? I'm not a psychologist at all, but I think reading these books unleashes an inner fantasy. Women for some reason want to be taken cared of and in return wants to do the taking care of. Whether it's cleaning, cooking, or doing whatever needs to be done in the bedroom. Travis and Abby may not have the healthiest of relationships, but what they did have was fantastic.<br /><br />Abby Abernathy is attending Eastern University to get away from her drunk mother and her down-on-his luck father. Who blames her for all the bad things that has happened to him. She attends with her best friend, America, who she hopes will keep her in line and away from the bad boys that she seems to attract. This Abby is turning a new page and will be a good girl. That is until she meets Travis \\"Mad Dog\\" Maddox. Who just so happens to be America's boyfriend's cousin. He's also a ragtag fighter in an underground fight club that he seems to be the king of. Once Travis has taken a liking to Abby it's no holds barred for him. That is until Abby finds herself attracted to Travis' fellow frat boy, Parker. A nice boy from a nice family who is looking to head to Harvard for medical school. Parker is everything that Travis isn't.<br /><br />However, Abby has lost a bet to Travis and has agreed to stay with Travis for one month in his apartment. She agrees, but it becomes plain that Travis cooked up this bet as a way to keep Abby around (originally the hot water heater in her dorm broke so staying at Shep's and Travis' was a good idea). Abby finds her feelings conflicted for Parker and Travis. He dates with Parker have ended poorly because of Travis, so the two decide to wait until she is back in her dorm before going out again.<br /><br />The beginning of the book is like a slow burn. You know that Abby is instantly and instinctively attracted to Travis, but she doesn't want someone like him. Once you figure out who Abby is and why this is no good for her you understand, but Travis' determination and stubbornness makes you root for him as well. I liked Parker, but I knew right off that he wasn't right for Abby.<br /><br />One of my favorite parts of this book is Travis' nickname for Abby, Pigeon or Pidge. It just seemed natural and it was only for her. There are a ton of ups and downs and you wonder if these two are really made for each other. They both seem to enjoy drama and pain. Travis gets beat for a living and Abby is trying to escape her past which has to do with Vegas, mobsters and her sick father. (He's a former gambling legend.)<br /><br />Another heart palpitating story. Some may not enjoy this book as much as I did, but like I stated in the beginning. It's a fantasy. Who doesn't want that bad boy who loves us with everything he has?<br /><br />I'm definitely looking forward to Travis' version of the story. It'll be interesting to hear his take on things and now there is a movie in the works. I just hope they get the casting down. I have an idea as to how Travis looks, but it's not like any star, it's just something that I thought up in my own head., but it's not like any star, it's just something that I thought up in my own head.
0793906091|5.0|As with everything else I've purchased through Amazon, the Star Wars trilogy did not disappoint. My grandson received it in excellent condition, original wrapper and in a timely manner.
B008QZ1ZYQ|1.0|This app loves to drain battery faster than any other app I have encountered. I loved the original game aand this one is the same, if you have the first one then don't get this one
0767817664|5.0|Ok first off the 2011 remake was horrible don't buy it, full of lousy acting and even worse CGI in almost every scene,infact the best part of the remake is the end credits. I wonder who the studio executives think want to see these remakes. The original Fright Night takes you back to a great time the 80's there is no internet, smart phones, CGI and the characters don't tweet in every scene. The story is great about a young all american boy next door Charlie Brewster  who loves classic horror films and wants to score with his girlfriend.The trouble begins when a vampire moves in next door. As the film shifts into gear he now has a ticked off vampire after him and his friend \\"Evil Ed\\" and his girlfriend Amy don't believe the guy next door is a vampire.The only one he can turn to is the local TV horror host Peter Vincent. The two then do battle with this vampire in a great fight sequence. This film creates an excellent atmosphere set in an all american town instead of cheesy Las Vegas and Roddy Mcdowell is brilliant as the Horror host Peter vincent.To bad they don't show horror films on local TV anymore, I mean seriously those were the days of great old horror films being shown by a horror host dressed like a ghoul or some other creature of the night. By the way\\"Evil Ed\\" steals the show and is not a whiny geek like in the remake.The film also pays homage to the classic Uniiversal horror films as well as the Hammer films you can see little signs of both hear and there in the background. So if your tired of crapy, wimpy, sissy vampire fare such as True Blood and the Twilight films buy 1985's Fright Night. I just wish there were more special features other than the trailer, c'mon not even a tribute to the late Roddy Mcdowell.
B0011UBDTK|2.0|As other reviewers have mentioned, several discs in this set do not work. I received SatC: The Complete Series as a Christmas gift, and it took me a while to go through all the discs, so I did not notice the problems within the 30 day window. A few months later I was frustrated to discover that some discs would not play at all, so I called Amazon and they let me send it in to exchange for a new set. I had the same problem with Round 2 so I returned it within the 30 day window and used the credit to give the Deluxe Edition a whirl. I'm much happier with that one. All the discs work - yay! Yes, it can be a little tough getting the discs in and out of the holders, but overall I like the presentation of the deluxe set much better, and it's nice knowing that I can pick an episode to watch with no anxiety about whether or not it will play.
B005FJ7DOM|4.0|It was a good film, sure parts of it where cheesy and low budget, but for a scifi fan, its worth it. Alot of the film reminded me of the ROAD, same mysterious beginning, what happened and how, etc. Overall plot was worth it. Its no big budget film, but it did the best with what it had, and I LOVED it. Watch it and make up your own mind!

0767903374|5.0|I can't express how fortunate I am to have finally found material that can guide me forward in a truly connected way. Written from one Highly Sensitive Person to others, each activity has a personal resonance for those who have struggled to value their sensitivity and find their niche in the world. I hope to have all of Dr. Aron's books in my \\"library\\" one day, to read, re-read and share, yet find \\"The Highly Sensitive Person's Workbook\\" especially helpful for those looking for a more hands-on experience of writing down a lifetime of trial and error, and transforming it into renewed hope each day and a much greater sense of self-worth and purpose.
0515141429|1.0|I read the first five novels because I wanted to get into this character. I love Mitch Rapp and Scot Harvath, so thinking Jack Reacher would be another I would like didn't seem like a stretch. Story line is too inconsistent. The writing is downright mediocre, at best. The research was non-existent. I can't begin to explain all the problems with Reacher's superhuman skills. He does things not even the best trained snipers in the world can do. He has the instincts of a career detective, which could have been honed in the special investigations unit he belonged to. He is as technically and tactically proficient as the most combat tested career special ops soldier. If he was any one of these things and the writer had done his research, the story would be more compelling and not unreadable.<br /><br />He would be alone as the only person in the world with the level of proficiency and skill sets he possesses. He would not be this disenfranchised drifter without a history. He would be very well known in the military world and very sought after when his military career concluded. He would not be one of these guys who falls between the cracks and no one cares. So the only explanation is he was intentionally a mediocre soldier who sold his country short by hiding his skills.<br /><br />My last criticism is the way people talk in the novels. I don't care where you are from in the US, the incomplete and incoherent phrases are not used by anyone. It makes the reading that much more difficult.<br /><br />I so much wanted to like these books and this character. Maybe his writing and research gets better after the 5th novel, but I just couldn't take it anymore.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book will leave you craving more! You won't want to put it down and you will wish you can meet Christian!
0374214913|3.0|I think this novel's description is trying very hard to sell this as a quirky mystery but the book doesn't really fit that genre.  I honestly have no idea what genre this would fit into besides fiction.  There is a little mystery to the book but the places where a little suspense could have been drummed up fell really flat for me.  Maybe I was hoping for something a little more adventurous than what boils down to computer techies doing computer techie things.  Don't get me wrong, this book was fun and there are interesting characters; I guess I was expecting more along the Dan Brown line of things with puzzles and a little action that this book didn't deliver for me.  This was an easy, light, fun read, though, and I would recommend it for anyone who is a little bit of a techie maybe looking for something to read on the bus to work or for a long flight.
0345803485|5.0|Hi,<br /><br />I got the book really fast, faster then minimum the date that it should be shipped.<br />the book itself really really good as the reviews says.
B000SGGUWS|4.0|Actual Rating: 3.5/5<br /><br />The cover:<br /><br />I like this cover. It suits the story better than the new cover featuring the TV Show's actresses as the characters because they simply don't fit the descriptions of the girls in the story. Also, I think the best covers are the Australian ones, their covers for the series are simply beautiful *_* (except they don't have a cover for this particular book -the first one in the series-!).<br /><br />The storyline:<br /><br />Okay. I had the most fortunate and unfortunate luck to start watching the TV Show based on this series before starting the books. It was both good and bad. Good because I knew what to expect from the book and was thrilled to find more details and twists that are not available in the show. Bad because I was spoiled most of the book, I kind of knew what was going to happen. And also because the characters in the book aren't like the ones in the TV show.<br /><br />However, I'm reviewing the book objectively as if I haven't watched the show. So this is my honest review of the book separately.<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />For those of you who have never watched the show or heard of it (like me less than 2 weeks ago...), here's a short spoiler free summary for you :).<br /><br />This book is about five best friends Alison, Aria, Emily, Hanna and Spencer. They've been best friends for sometime now and it's the end of seventh grade. They're now having a sleepover at the night to celebrate the beginning of summer vacation, however, Ali disappears that night.<br /><br />The book starts by explaining what happened the day Ali disappears, but then picks up three years later with the girls getting ready for Junior year. They're no longer talking to each other and are living separate lives although they are still in the same small-town of Rosewood. It gives us a glimpse to what happened to each girl separately and how they've been dealing with Ali's disappearance. And throughout the story, we get to know more about each character's relationship with Ali and what secrets she had on them. How they've been living and what's up with them now.<br /><br />Then suddenly, Spencer, Emily, Hanna and Aria start receiving anonymous text messages about past secrets that only Ali knew about and new ones that no one knows about.<br /><br />At the end of the book, the girls try to bond back together.<br /><br />What I liked:<br /><br />- The storyline itself is very unique and compelling.<br /><br />- It is full of mystery, sadness, twists, scary moments, thriller, loss and heartbreak.<br /><br />- The girls' friendship is very unique. They had each other and all of a sudden it was taken away from them. We all could relate to that.<br /><br />- I loved the fact that each chapter is told about a different characters. It is mostly in this order: Emily, Spencer, Hanna then Aria. But it changes a bit at the end.<br /><br />- There's no specific narrator. The author tells you the story as she sees it.<br /><br />- It deals with real high school problems.<br /><br />- \\"A\\"! I love \\"A\\" as crazy as it sounds!! &lt;3.<br /><br />- It was a fast read.<br /><br />- The ending :').<br /><br />What I disliked:<br /><br />- I didn't like the writing style that much. It was somewhat fast paced and everything was happening so quickly. But it might be just me because I'm not used to it.<br /><br />- There is a lot of swearing words. I don't think such sophisticated, young and somewhat wealthy and well raised girls should swear this much if not at all!<br /><br />- Not to mention, the girls smoke! It's just not right... I'm not against women smoking, but I think 16year olds shouldn't. (Again, a personal opinion.).<br /><br />The characters:<br /><br />Alison DiLaurentis (a.k.a Ali): She's somewhat the main character in this book. A very malicious, deadly and unfriendly girl who becomes friends with Aria, Spencer, Emily and Hanna. Only she's mostly toying with them, taken their secrets and then threating to expose them if they don't do what she says. She disappears in the summer of their seventh grade and doesn't show up. The girls thought they're safe because their secrets are gone. Guess what? They were wrong.<br /><br />Aria Montgomery: The hippy friend. She's been been always made fun of by Ali for her weird style of dressing. After Ali's disappearance, she stayed a year and a half in Iceland and came back later for her junior year of High School. She meets a very attractive guy and they fall in love instantly. Later on, turns out that this guy is her AP English teacher, Mr. Ezra Fitz. Throughout the book, Aria goes into a lot of trouble keeping an old secret and a new one, but unfortunately, A gets to her and start warning her. Aria is very nice, friendly and cute in her own way. She's one of my favorite characters in this book :).<br /><br />Emily Fields (a.k.a Em or Emy): The jock girl. A very nice, shy and good swimmer. She's the shiest in the group and tries to keep to herself. She tries so hard to hide the fact that she's gay from everyone thinking that they'll judge her and hate her. However, when she meets Maya, the new girl living in Ali's house, she starts to have very serious second thoughts about herself and her feelings. \\"A\\" obviously doesn't miss a chance to torture her and ruin her life.<br /><br />Hanna Marin (a.k.a Han): Han has serious problems and very bad morals (part of why I don't like her this much in these books so far - reading Flawless-). She used to be treated very badly by Alison, who used to call her Hefty Hanna, because she was fat and had grease everywhere in her body. When Ali disappeared, Hanna continued her commitment to try harder and be the next It Girl, which she achieved, using every thing she could do or get. Now the most popular girl in Rosewood Day, she faces other issues, including \\"A\\". She's now dating her longtime crush Sean Ackard who happens to be a member of the Virginity Club. Her father also comes back in her life and things are complicated again. \\"A\\", as always, being the \\"nice\\" person, intervenes only to make things even worse.<br /><br />Spencer Hastings (a.k.a Spence): The smartest in the group. Her family is very strict, serious and always the first in everything. She has a very nice and unique personality (she's my 2nd favorite character in this book :).) with loopholes as usual. She's always the one who stood up to Ali and was the last one who saw her before she went missing. Now, three years later, she's as determined and serious as ever, wanting to beat her older sister's, Melissa's, records. But, there's one thing she always wants despite her having everything; her sister's boyfriends. And so, she meets her sister's soon to be fianc&eacute; Wren who's British, an intern to become a doctor, funny and cute. And the problems begin and get more complicated as \\"A\\" threatens to share her secrets, including those only her and Ali knew about.<br /><br />Other characters worth mentioning: Mona, Hanna's best friend since Ali's disappearance. She used to be harassed by Ali and her group (although Aria, Em, Han and Spence never said anything to help or stop Ali) for being a nerd and she tried so hard to be Ali's friend, but never succeeded, until Ali wen missing. Mike, Aria's younger brother. Darren Wilden, a cop who almost arrests Hanna. Ashley, Hanna's mother. Byron and Ella, Aria's parents.<br /><br />Favorite quotes:<br /><br />You wonder how someone so...well, so much like you went missing. You thought only girls who entered beauty pageants ended up on the sides of milk cartons.<br /><br />Well, think again. --- How it All Started.<br /><br />Aria headed into the classroom and fell into the first desk she saw. She put her head down and took heaving, emotional breaths.<br /><br />\\"Hell is other people,\\" she chanted. It was her favorite quote by the French philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre and a perfect mantra for Rosewood. --- Chapter 5: Starts and Fitz.<br /><br />Life's somuch fun when you know everything.<br /><br />Just how do I know so much?

But what's the fun in that?<br /><br />I'll be watching. --A --- What Happens Next...<br /><br />Conclusion:<br /><br />Ouf. Finally!<br /><br />Well, I do favorite this book. It has been good, the series still has some potential, it could've been so much better.<br /><br />What do I have to say? Okay. If you've never watched the TV show, start this one first. You'll have an idea about the TV show and also you'll enjoy it much more since you won't be spoiled ;).<br /><br />If you've watched/you're watching the show, don't have high expectations! You might be really disappointed... First, you'll be spoiled, second, you'll feel like that there are unnecessarily details and most importantly, you'll probably dislike the characters (the best example for the last one is Hanna, in the TV show she's nice and thoughtful despite her being the It Girl, in the book, she's a complete bitch).<br /><br />From an objective point of view (regardless of my opinion on the TV Show): Give this book a chance. I didn't dislike it. I just think it could've been better :). If you're a fan of: mystery, thriller, murder, suspense, twists and at the same time a quick read then pick it up. You won't regret it :), because whether you like it or not, you'll have an opinion and an experience of your own :).<br /><br />Now time for me to finish Flawless ^_^.and things are complicated again. \\"A\\", as always, being the \\"nice\\" person, intervenes only to make things even worse.<br /><br />Spencer Hastings (a.k.a Spence): The smartest in the group.

0061801313|4.0|From Tween 2 Teen Book Reviews:<br /><br />Before you read please note, this book has content for older readers. It is not appropriate for younger readers.<br /><br />  Now that that's settled, on to business. The idea of Pretty Little Liars is very good. I love the whole, getting text messages from a missing/possibly dead person part. The plot always kept me on my toes. I'm always wondering what's going to happen next. Secrets are everywhere. Revealing memories can come out at any moment. And nothing in the book happens by accident. There is a reason for everything.<br /><br />  There a four main characters. There's Spencer. She is a nice girl, but can't help but feel jealous of her sister. Her parents tend to notice her weaknesses more than her strengths, so I can't blame her for being jealous of the sister everyone else thinks is perfect. There's Aria. She's also a nice girl. She's always remembering when she was younger and how insecure she was. Now she's very comfortable in her skin. She has some guy problems that need to be worked out, but she's decent. Then there's Hanna. Of the four characters, I liked her the least. Or at least, I liked her the least at first. She's a very popular girl who isn't very nice, but as the book progresses, her many insecurities are revealed, along with some family problems. My favorite character is Emily. She's a nice girl who at first, seems like she has a nice life. Though her parents aren't as nice as the seem. Emily's always strived to be perfect, but what if her parents can't except her for who she is?<br /><br />  I loved the idea of the book. The details weren't amazing, but I liked it. The point of view switched between the four girls, so when a secret was revealed at the end of a chapter, it made me want to read more until I got to that girl again. I read this book in one afternoon and can't wait to read the next one. I give this book four stars.<br /><br />[...]
B007ZZKWHY|5.0|I have waiting to see this movie for over a year now for the most part I was not disapointed. I would have liked to see the backstory on how they got to the moon in 1945 and a little expanding on the presidental campain would have been nice. The blue ray treatment was good but the extra featurs were a little sparse (all the Teaser trailers should have been included)<br />Very good story. For the budget spent as good as  \\"sky captain and the world of tomorrow\\" which had a much larger budget and better than almost every Scfy chanel produced movie.<br />Hollywood should take notice of this film and what can be done on a very modest budget.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I loved the book. Their is a story, along with all that good sex in it. I loved all three books.:-)
B008CLI3TE|5.0|This is the best show currently on television in my opinion. The books are fantastic and the show does a pretty good job of keeping true to them. The acting is top notch by everyone in the cast and the adult nature keeps it grounded in originality. Every episode leaves you dying to know what's going to happen next (unless you read the books before) which I can't say about every show. I'm so tired of seeing tv shows based around hospitals, doctors, police work, or crime scenes. I hope George RR Martin keeps writing books so the show never ends!

B004529NLG|5.0|really couldn't believe it - I'm a guy who hates \\"do you think you can dance\\" so tape so my wife can watch who loves it. BI bought it for her but the 3 D knocked me out! plot sucks so bad so no need to pay attention but I rate the 3 D as one of the best in our collection 2nd second place - next to Res Evil.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|Book #2 of the 'Song of Ice and Fire' series manages to up the bombast on all the high points of Book #1 with more drama, more backstabbing, more action/violence and all around more goodness.  At near 1000 pages this one is a whopper but Martin's excellent cliff-hanger'esque pacing provides a first rate beach read.  If you've already watched Season #2 of the HBO series this volume is still worth reading as the 2nd half significantly differs over the TV adaptation.

038541627X|5.0|Let it be known that the title of this review could be applied to both the book and how I feel about the man, Isaac Asimov, in general. The tales contained within \\"The Complete Stories, Vol. I\\" explore broad topics including space exploration, colonization, politics, relationships, war, and even religion, nearly all of which are as thought-provoking and interesting today as they were when they were originally penned 50+ years ago. The short story format makes this book easily digestible and most of the stories are fairly brief, between 5 and 15 pages. Isaac Asimov's unique voice, visionary ideas and nimble grasp of language redefined what science fiction means to me. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and highly recommend it to anyone looking for big sci-fi in a small package.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Suspenseful and easy to read. A good ending to a series of books. I would read more of the series if they were ever written.
B004K8WJ3Y|4.0|Since the \\"Good To Be Bad\\" album Whitesnake released their 11th album Forevermore, and David Coverdale has secured that he is a legend in my mind after listening to Forevermore.  It's typical Whitesnake so you won't feel cheated although it got released in 2011.  Each song on this album is good, and the songwriting is up to par to anything done decades ago.  Coverdale's voice has aged a bit and you can hear it in the last two albums, but he still has his highs and their is a youthful fire in the heavier songs.  This album shows that after all those years their is still that bluesy element complimented with metal riffs that Whitesnake is known for.  The band have to be credited for it's refreshing sound, and we know that Coverdale always had top musicians in his staff so Forevermore will not disappoint.  The title track \\"Forevermore\\" is one of my faves on this album.  It starts slow then it goes into a heavy middle eastern riff that reminds me of Led Zep or Coverdale/Page album.  It starts strong and ends strong.  If you are a Whitesnake fan you are not complete without this album.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|Love, love, love the series... Martin keeps the reader guessing which way the story will go because the characters are all so fallible that they don't fit into the stereotypical character molds. As always, the books are much better than the TV series, although the series does a credible job of capturing a lot of what is in the books. The only complaint I have in reading the books in Kindle format is the lack of accessibility to the detailed maps of Westeros found on the front pages of the hard copy book... difficult to swap back and forth when I want to refresh my memory of the layout of the world.
0062206281|5.0|...and back to Barcelona of 1958, to the bookstore owned by Daniel and his father - and to the story told by Daniel. The \\"Prisoner of Heaven\\" opens some Russian dolls that were left unopened in the first two books, but it turns out that the ones inside have their own secrets and wait to be opened. We learn what happened to Daniel after \\"Shadow of the Wind\\" story stops; we learn what happened to David Martin after \\"The Angel's Game \\" ended; we visit again the Cemetery of Forgotten Books.<br /> There is no devil or \\"real\\" magic in this story, but sometimes people commit deeds worth of evil and the mysteries of real life can compete with the miracles of fairy tales and horror stories. At least, this is what I felt when I read this book.  And I walked the streets of Barcelona again - even if only in my imagination.<br /><br />Easily, 5 stars - and it looks like we can expect more books found on the \\"cemetery of forgotten books\\". Something to look forward to.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Evermore helps people organize things that are important to the consumer. Then makes them handy in an easy way to find in a very mobile way! 4.5stars!!!
0439023513|2.0|This book left me very angry.  It was written completely different than the first two with no character development!  I kept waiting and waiting for it to happen and it just worsened until the end.  There is no way this is a young adult book - it was a adult tyrant about war.  The little romance in the first two books was completely lost and Katniss doesn't become a mockingjay at all.  This book had so much potential - I could come up with dozens of better story lines.  I hope the movie takes a different look on it.
0441020712|5.0|A novel which strives to impart the 'Overview Effect' upon it's reader, that shift an astronaut experiences when the focus of his world view is shifted forever.  Blue Remembered Earth, is one of Reynolds best works and it is a difficult task which Reynolds took upon himself in trying to impart that cognitive shift upon the reader, and as such it will not be successful for every reader. There are several negative reviews of this book, in which I feel, the reviewer failed to make the leap.<br /><br />The book starts as a standard quest narrative, and focuses the reader in on tiny details as one tries to put together the pieces like a mystery novel. All the while a huge plot is constructed around the plot thread. When the final reveal occurs the whole focus changes outward to a very large field of focus. This book *is* space euphoria if you can make that leap from written fiction. This elevation of perspective is the goal of good science fiction, and this work achieves that goal. A euphoric read for serious science fiction fans.
0525423281|4.0|Stephanie Perkins is the Queen of writing Swoon-worthy YA contemporaries. Anna and the French Kiss made my top ten books of last year, so I was eagerly anticipating the companion novel. First of all, let me mention Lola and Cricket, I loved them so much more then Anna and St. Clair, and I think it was because Lola was a rocker-esque artsy girl, so I feel like I was able to connect to her more. She was so well-crafted and such a unique character, and who dosen't love a swoon-worthy boy next door??!! Although St. Clair I think was a bit more romantic, I still loved Cricket.<br /><br />Ok onto Lola and Crickets' romance, for some reason I feel like the chemistry between Anna and St. Clair was so much more authentic and felt more natural, where as for some reason it didn't click as well with Lola and Cricket for me. I loved them as individual characters but their romance didn't feel as authentic for whatever reason. I might be alone in saying this but the cameo appearences of Anna and St. Clair in this book kind-of annoyed me, yes you heard me right, I found their characters in this book to be borderline annoying, and I feel like they didn't really add anything to the book, instead made it kind-of borderline cheesy.<br /><br />Although I feel like a few things were lacking for me, I also know that I had REALLY HIGH expectations going into it and that might be why I was a bit more critical then I might normally have been. I still really enjoyed the story, and love Stephanie Perkins, she's definitely an author I have on autobuy (meaning whatever she writes, i'll buy) and if you love a fun, swoon-worthy, quick read Lola and the Boy Next Door will not dissapoint.
1475143389|4.0|A friend told me about this book so I thought I would give it read.  Only took a couple hours to get through it and I found some very interesting concepts that have never occured to me before.  I've alwasy been in the camp of 3 sets of 10 on every exercise and hit your targeted muscle group with enough to burn out.  What a shocker that that's not neccesary.  The nutrition info was also eye opening.  Turns out, just increasing you protein intake and adding some suppliments is not the ideal method.  I'm ready to give this plan a try and see the results.
B0091XRL86|4.0|A silly, entertaining tale. Fast-paced. In the beginning the film tried a little too hard to be funny, but it got better over time. It's fun and the claymation is really well-done.

0375842209|5.0|The Book Thief is set during World War II in the town of Molching, just outside of Munich. It is about a girl named Liesel Meminger, who is the book thief. She first steals a book at her brother's funeral, and then is brought to Molching to live with Hans and Rosa Hubermann, her foster parents. Hans is very kind, and he teaches her how to read, and soon she is stealing books from Nazi book burnings and the mayor's wife library, among other places. Then Max Vanderberg, a Jew, arrives, and is sheltered in their basement, changing Liesel. All very well, you may say, but the interesting thing about this one is that the book is narrated by...Death. Death himself. I thought that was certainly an interesting idea, especially in a time of war, when  Death is so busy. The interludes where Death muses on...well, death, for the most part, aren't quite as clever as Zusak seems to think they are, though are intriguing, and foreshadow what's to come. And amusing, somehow, with a sort of grim, dark, humor. I enjoyed The Book Thief just as much as before; there's just something about it that makes it very compelling indeed. The Book Thief is certainly not an easy book to read, to grapple with, and it can be very sad and also moving. Zusak's style in this one is also very distinctive, quite different from his other book, I Am the Messenger. I would recommend to everyone.<br /><br />All of my reviews can be read at my blog novareviews.blogspot.com.

I can't wait to read the next two! Don't know what the people writing negative are looking for, but this is an excellent book.  It makes me laugh, and want to cry.  I love the main characters.  Especially Christian Grey.
1609611543|5.0|This book is amazing and the scientific research included in it is hard to doubt. After having eliminated wheat and gluten products for three weeks, I have lost one pants size (two inches) and have more energy than I have had in a long time.  I can focus mentally and I have very little between-meal cravings.  Even my mood is better.  I plan to stay gluten-free for life, thanks to Dr. Davis and his great book.  Ignore the naysayers - this book is the real thing, and going wheat-free is the secret to better health.

1451627297|5.0|I don't have much to say here about this novel.  When a novel quenches my thirst like this one did, words often seem superfluous.  I just wanted to award it 5 golden stars, in my humble opinion.  And encourage others to read it.<br /><br />Sometimes my green card blurs to yellow.  And to red on sunny cloudless days when it should be the brightest green.  Our time here is precious and fleeting.  Do the day and let the day do you.  And let the obdurate past do itself.<br /><br />That's what Wireman still says...

B0000067L4|5.0|Simply one of the greatest rock albums ever released. Or, if you like, three of the greatest live tracks ever released with 3 studio tracks added on but not an 'album'. What does it matter? Because the only thing wrong with this CD is that it doesn't contain a fourth live track instead of, or in addition to, the three short studio tracks.<br />With CD allowing much more space than the original LP it's a disgrace that Polydor haven't rectified this. With one or two extra live tracks it would have the makings of what discophiles like to think of as an 'album' and people compiling recommended discographies might stop moaning about it being a(n)(arbitrary) hodgepodge and completely forgetting to rate it primarily on the musical quality of the individual tracks rather than as some sort of meaningful, tidy or satisfying arrangement of numbers.<br />This 'record' has been sadly undervalued ever since its release simply because it is neither a studio album nor a live album although there was an obvious reason for this since there were 3 studio tracks left over after Cream broke up. The three very well chosen live numbers which were added used up all the remaining space on the vinyl format. What more could people want?<br /><br />But a friendly warning, this is not for the fainthearted, or the musically fainthearted. These live tracks need to be given total concentrated attention, the sort of attention you would give to a Beethoven development section. Nevertheless, music of this split-brain intensity in the playing, and Nietzschean heroism in the vocals, is not for everyone, and I fear there's nothing to be done about that. But I suppose there is always the much tamer 'Wheels of Fire' studio album which has two of these numbers, 'Politician' and 'Sitting On Top of The World', for those who want something less demanding - primarily less demanding in terms of passion; the concentrated contrapuntal tension is what is necessary to produce it. But when Bruce is on good vocal form, as he is here, his singing is immeasurably more passionate than anything he or anyone else, except perhaps Plant, could achieve in the studio.<br /><br />For those who do appreciate this album there is unfortunately only one other disc to match it. That is the live 'Wheels Of Fire' disc with the very famous 'Crossroads' and the 16min live version of 'Spoonful'. I think this live 'Spoonful' is probably the finest, noblest achievement of rock music so far, both on account of Bruce's vocal performance and the superbly maintained tension and architecture of the long middle section. I have heard quite a few of their live Spoonfuls on bootlegs etc. but this one is undoubtedly the best. The three live tracks on 'Goodbye' run it pretty close and are the next most important pieces we have.<br />However, it is also worth knowing that there are at least 2 very fine live performances on 'Live Cream Vol.2' ( Sunshine Of Your Love and Politician) and that there is a longer and better version of N.S.U. to be found (only)as part of the 4disc set 'Those Were The Days' which also contains  better stereo balanced mixes of the less satisfactory ones on both 'Live Cream Vols.1 and 2'. It's also worth noting Bruce's particularly fine vocal on 'Deserted Cities Of The Heart' on LC Vol.2. - another magnificent example of what can only be found in Cream as I have described above.<br />But the stereo mixes of these three tracks are as good as they can be, and 'I'm So Glad' in particular is far better than the mix in the box-set. The other mix of 'Glad' is only useful if you want to study exactly what Clapton is playing since the lead guitar is brought much further forward. Unfortunately this destroys the competitive balance with the bass and the performance ends up being much less exciting than it is on this original album<br /><br />It's obvious that what the record company should have done long ago (as soon as Cream started appearing om CD) is to move the studio tracks on this album to the Wheels Of Fire studio album where they really belong and would work well as fillers to bulk it up a bit. The remaining live tracks should have been supplemented with various other live tracks which have emerged since the original vinyl albums - there is at least one bootleg in fine quality of an Oakland concert which has different versions of Spoonful, Crossroads, Sunshine and others, and there is another Sunshine released on a Clapton CD single as a third track as well as the NSU mentioned above in the box set. There are also different performances of Crossroads, Sunshine and Spoonful on wolfgangsvault.
6304779356|5.0|I loved this film. Mostly because of the sexy sax man in it. However, the rest of it was good, too. I watched the sexy saxman over and over, like ten times. Sometimes, I have to put it on and just watch him walk the stage and shake his hips. Well,anyway, that's my review. You guys just screw off.
B0000067L3|5.0|This performance of 'Spoonful' is the '9th Symphony'* of Rock, combined with 'The Rite Of Spring'. Jack Bruce is the human race individualised. He is the first and last man on earth. He is Job, Prometheus, Mani and Zarathustra. His song is a great humanist assertion or a great song of Gnostic defiance or both. You say it's just a blues with two chords? No, it's the blues transcended. It's the apotheosis of the blues - and it could only be achieved with Bruce's heroic jouissance as a singer, and simultaneously playing bass which is partly where the incredible tension comes from: i.e doing both: Robert Johnson achieved a similar contrapuntal tension singing and playing the guitar at the same time but only connoiseurs seem to be able to hear it.<br />No one else could have achieved this, and the performance of course also depends and benefits from the tensions contributed by the other two as well. These tensions, need I say, are mainly rhythmic and contrapuntal (rhythmic contradictions and ambiguities are also what this neo-contrapuntalism is all about). And that's all there even before you get to the improvisation which is sustained three part contrapuntal concentration but with plenty of light and shade and variation of dynamics. The most powerful example in music of the neo-contrapuntal style apart from this is Stravinsky's 'Rite Of Spring'. There aren't really any other examples worth mentioning of it being the sustained principle of the work, or the piece, outside of a handfull of other live Cream performances. Otherwise there are only a few examples, usually much shorter and less rigorous, of live rock music by such groups as Led Zeppelin.<br />Cream did occasionally play straight blues but in their best work they achieved a Beethovenian affirmation of life in the face of everything that ALL human beings are confronted with. In these performances the blues has come a long way from social marginalisation and right to the existential centre. In other words there isno longer any sense of this being the music of the powerless underdog or self-conscious social deviant.<br />Many other people have said a lot about Crossroads and given it very high praise which is fine by me except inasmuch as they neglect Spoonful (and 'I'm So Glad', 'Politician', and 'Sitting On Top Of The World' in the live versions found on 'Goodbye Cream').<br /><br />The studio disc here is disappointing, as ever with Cream, but at least this time the stereo sound stage is normal and the sound and placing of the drums is convincing. The problem is with the overdubbing of guitars and the usual studio frigidity of the whole thing. Another problem is the thin, brittle sound of Clapton's guitars. The remastered versions on the 4disc set 'Those Were The Days' are better in this respect with a warmer guitar sound.<br /><br />*Beethoven's obviously.
B004LROUW2|5.0|However hard I have tried for many years to read and get in the habit of reading, I was never able to do so. Loss of focus, tired eyes, not having the patience (of course coming from movies is not easy). And readers kept on telling me that I have not found the one I really like, or my style. Few weeks ago someone at work left 1Q84 Audio book on the 'free table', I didn't know what it was at first; I just picked it up because it was FREE and big. Later in the day, I realized that it was a book.  \\"Aha.. Maybe this will help? I thought to myself, it must not be good. Why would someone leave this kind of big item on the table for anybody to take? Generally they will try to give it to someone who will appreciate it or keep it for themselves? No?'  Just small thoughts that rushed through my head. Still, determined to give it a try and to feel what reader feel when they say \\"I couldn't put the book down, Oh, don't tell me you didn't read this or that? \\".. So I started listening to the story to/from work/home. Soon after, I was lost in this fictional world; I literally took the stairs to this new world of moons to do my reading/listening; very far from here yet I can reach to this place almost instantaneously.  At times I even had to take vacation time (few hrs.) from work because I couldn't leave my car when I get to work, after 45 minutes of commute and so I sit and get consumed and eaten by the story. This is my first ever book experience I have read or someone narrated it for me and I actually finally got it!<br /> After the fact, I read all the reviews, few warning others \\"you shouldn't start reading Murakami with 1Q84, try like the Norwegian - Wind etc....\\". Well it was a little too late, to me this book actually opened up a window in me that I never knew it's existence, I can see through it clearly and feels amazingly new and fresh. Through it I discovered my taste buds for books or types of stories I really enjoy. Still I can't read but listen. Since then (last week) I have also run with him when he was talking about running.  This actually gave me a tiny little insight to the creator of the world that swept me off my feet that I couldn't stop listening.  Now I can say I know what it feels when you find the book you like to read. It's way better than movies, and I am just realizing that fact although I have heard it many times before. Thank you Mr. Murakami for making me fall for your thoughts and opening my window that I have never seen before. I can't wait to discover more.<br /><br />I still don't know who left the book on that free table at work.
B004ADB17Y|4.0|I have loved this movie since it first came out and now my kids enjoy it.<br />This is a movie you will never get sick of watching.
B008ETOSYI|5.0|Get out your Kleenex folks and get prepared for a movie that touches your heart in many ways, those who are dying overseas, love, faith, determination and destiny. This is probably the best movie I've seen since \\"On Golden Pond\\" and will likely be in the same category forever. It will make you laugh, make you cry, give you encouragement, and make you angry - but lastly, will make you happy in life and all its memories - good and bad. The message? You only live once, so make the best of the life you have. You never know when yours ends or those of whom you love the most. A definite 5 star production, with excellent film quality. Don't forget the Kleenex - you will need it. Me? I blubbered all over my pillowcase. Now it's time to change it. Wish I'd had my Kleenex...Be well, all.
1594744769|5.0|I was a little worried when I purchased this novel that it would be a teen/children's book and not satisfying for an adult reader. I was happily proven wrong. The book is very well written and entertaining. This is story telling at its finest level. Characters and plot are well developed and believable. I had difficulty putting the book down and read it in a day. I was left wanting more at the conclusion and hope the author is inspired to continue his writing. It seems to me there is much more to tell about these children and their circumstances. I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good story that is well written.
B002X02V02|5.0|I bought both of these albums in different Transactions. I think when I purchased it, there was no option to purchase both THE FAME and THE FAME MONSTER from the Deluxe edition of THE FAME MONSTER.<br /><br />At any rate I'll start by saying that initially I hated Lady GaGa. JUST DANCE was just another pop song about a sex crazed girl getting crazy at a party. LOVE GAME was just about a sex crazed girl getting some booty. I even hated PAPARAZZI, which I curse myself now for doing cause its such a great song. POKERFACE though ... it spoke to me in many ways after I finally started listening to the words. But even without the words, I love the beat and her casino/gambling metaphors. The lyrics are great for setting the scene. Something that in general she has a knack for, painting a good picture about the topic she is singing about.<br />Reflecting on my foolish way, I realize that I was just hiding my love for GaGa behind a façade similar to an in-the-closet homosexual republican who's tyrannical heart is filled with denial and hate on the GLBT community. As soon as I came out of the closet I also came to appreciate GaGa. So much so that I'll be listening to these songs for the rest of the time I write the rest of this review and maybe the rest of the day.<br /><br />There are many fantastic songs on both albums. I could listen to all of GaGa's albums back to back on a daily basis they wouldn't get old. I like music too much to limit myself though, and she would encourage me to expand my horizons. Her metaphors are sometimes a stretch, but I think with her personality it isn't that out of place. It is hard to say which song is a favorite. POKERFACE, BAD ROMANCE, PAPARAZZI, SPEECHLESS all the ones from the radio are on it for a reason, but the other songs are just as good.<br /><br />Her bodygaurds better keep her alive until I die. A world without GaGa is a summer without sunshine, a spring without rain, and a winter without snow.
030758836X|3.0|Book was great in the beginning.  I especially liked the way the author used two narrators:  husband writes in the present, while we hear the wife's side of the story from her diary entries.  Husband and wife are married 5 years and their marriage is on the rocks.  On their fifth anniversary, wife disappears.  Of course, everyone thinks hubby did it.  The story unfolds from the two narrators.<br /><br />As the story unwinds, I kept going back and forth between believing husband was innocent and then thinking he was guilty as sin.  She had a great plot going until the end.  Absolutely hated the ending:  It almost seemed like the author was just tired of writing and stopped.
B004K4AUZW|5.0|Eventhough I liked THE FAME & THE FAME MONSTER more than this album, I really enjoy how GaGa took some of her music in a completely different direction, yet most of it stays in the same general area without being called the same. She still has her digital dance beats and piano ballads in others, but its the rock factor that really spikes the punch. ELECTRIC CHAPEL & EDGE OF GLORY are 2 of the best songs on the album with surprisingly good electric guitar incorporation. There are others, all of them pretty amazing songs. The whole album is really, really good so I'm just going to encourage you to really consider HEAVY METAL LOVER & GOVERNMENT HOOKER. Those two songs are just hot. But YOU AND I stands just below BAD ROMANCE as nearing the pinnacle of her talent.<br /><br />I have heard my friends and family say that they listened to some of the songs on this album and they just didn't think it was as original as her first. Many think she is copying off Madonna, that whole bit. There are a couple songs (FASHION OF HIS LOVE) that sounds like Madonna wrote, and composed, and sung them back in the late 80s early 90s. I would have been with her removing FASHION OF HIS LOVE from the track list for this reason, and because I think that she could have done the same thing with almost the same lyrics, but in a different way. It does fit into the Christian theme that she seems to be trying to incorporate. BORN THIS WAY is one which I have a problem with being so bashed because it is so similar to EXPRESS YOURSELF. Even if GaGa did rip off Madonna, I think it is for the greater good. She wrote a song that gives people hope in themselves and their future. The overwhelming majority of the album isn't anything like Madonna, past or present. Madonna also twisted this \\"reductive\\" mishap into a advantageous gag when she mashed the 2 songs on her MDNA tour<br /><br />Once again, I could listen to this entire album back to back. She really seems to have poured her heart and soul into making this record and that has to be why people respect and idolize her. She knows how to take those emotions, questions, struggles, etc and make a great song. Basically, Lady GaGa is a spectacular philanthropist. I cannot wait until ARTPOP hits.ing this record and that has to be why people respect and idolize her. She knows how to take those emotions, questions, struggles, etc and make a great song.

0765316994|1.0|What a piece.  I cut my losses on this one about 60% of the way through it.  Why?  Why not.  It was either stop reading or slit my wrists and I figured I had to live in order to write this review.<br /><br />It's a shame that this book is so terrible.  I like the author and  the Old Man's War is one of the best books I've read in the last few years.  However, Redshirts just doesn't do it for me.<br /><br />As I read, I just kept asking myself, \\"what the heck am I reading?\\"  I'm not even sure how to classify this book.  I think it was sort of a cross between Star Trek and The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.  In other words, take the Star Trek model and make it stupid.
B004YM6JI2|5.0|This is one of the best shows currently running for a couple of reasons:<br /><br />1. It is a well blended entertainment.<br />(The characters are intelligent and have senses of humor, which allows them to lighten the tension, when needed, with a well placed quip, which also lets the audience know the characters are reacting to what's going on in pretty much the same way the viewer is. Great for pulling the audience even further into the story. But it is not, in any sense, self-parody. When the scary strikes, you take it seriously.)<br />2. It never falls back on Scotty to save the day.<br />(One thing that weakened the otherwise brilliant Star Trek series was that, after having gotten trapped in some dire situation and struggled through 80% of the episode trying to deal with it, in the last few minutes Scotty would always come up with some techno-babble based solution to the danger by routing the impulse engines through the tractor beam or whatever. Once, okay, I buy it. But do it every week and it merely becomes a plot resolution convenience that is expected, totally ruining any tension. Supernatural never depends on some convenient or coincidental solution to the problem. And the tension remains high due to the fact that they've already killed off major, continuing characters... Dad, Bobby, Rufus, Ellen, Jo, etc. etc. Every life is up for grabs each episode which makes it nail biting week after week.)<br /><br />If you've never watched this program, try the first few episodes of season one. If it doesn't grab your interest, then it isn't for you. But if it does, make room on your DVD shelf for the entire series, because this is a show you can watch over and over again and still enjoy.
0765322889|1.0|After reading about 100 pages of this book, it came to decision making time... should I hang myself and end the misery or not?  Lucky for you, I simply put the book down and stepped away.  No really - lucky for you.  Otherwise, you would have to read a much longer review that broke down in amazing detail how messed up this book was.<br /><br />I used to really try to read bad books all the way to the end.  Heck, I stuck with that turd Cryptonomicon until the conclusion.  I even stuck with On the Beach.  However, after reading numerous terrible books, I've found that I have just lost the patience for it.  It's like going out to dinner with a girl that you can't stand and having to listen to her talk about her problems.  Ahhhh... just let me pay the bill and get out of here!  I've had the appetizer and I can tell that the rest of this meal is going to suck.<br /><br />After 100 pages, I would expect a book to make some semblance of sense.  Who are these people?  What are they doing?  Why are they doing it?  What the heck is going on?  Why is the soul of some dude running around in a puppet?  Where did the author come up with these ridiculous names for people?<br /><br />If you want a true measure of how bad this book is, look at how many reviewers stopped reading it after about 100 to 200 pages.  That seems to be a common theme running through the poor reviews.  The readers give it a reasonable chance, but just can't take it anymore after 100 to 200 pages.  Lots of books get their share of bad reviews, but it is unusual to see so many people simply quit reading out of frustration.<br /><br />I read one favorable review (on another website) that stated that if reading epic fantasy was like jumping into the deep end of a pool, reading this was like jumping into the ocean.  The reviewer stated that the author has created an epic fantasy world and drops the reader into it with no background or explanation.<br /><br />Yeah, I think that is accurate... and that is the problem.  An author dropping you in the \\"middle of the ocean\\" is a good thing how?  While some may view this approach as admirable or profound, I just found it to be an unnecessary pain.  There are dozens of books that I wish to read, so why put up with this nonsense?  It's like being a rock star - I have dozens of groupies waiting outside my hotel room, so why put up with the \\"high-maintenance\\" one.  I'd rather just dump her back in the hall and grab another that won't make me have to put up with her crap.

0545123275|1.0|First off, this will be short, because I admit - I didn't finish this book. I got to about halfway through, holding on to hope that something was going to happen but unfortunately, nothing did. I picked up this book a couple days ago, and today, I can barely even remember what it's about. Something about a girl with a crush on a wolf, and a wolf with a crush on a girl - and they both think about it a lot. And that's IT.<br /><br />I'm bummed that I didn't like this book. I'm actually really drawn to a lot of the writing in it. Some parts were simply beautiful, and very atmospheric in a way that I enjoyed. But eventually, even among pretty writing, I still needed something to actually happen in the story. I know that sometimes you need to invest in a book in order to really get to the meat of the plot - but in books like that, in order to keep the reader invested, you really need to have amazing characters that make the reader want to wait to find out what happens to them.<br /><br />Unfortunately, that wasn't the case here either. The characters came off sort of flat and predictable, and I just couldn't find it in myself to continue reading to find out what (if anything) ever happened to them.<br /><br />It pains me to give any book 1 star, because I have such a love for books and realize that authors put lots of work into them - but this one just wasn't for me at all.

B003YL4LYI|2.0|If I wasn't already thousands of pages into this series I would have considered dropping it after Feast for Crows.  I found myself skipping over paragraph after paragraph of useless descriptions of food items and repetitive character thoughts and insight.  Also find myself wishing there was some corresponding timeline between all the characters.  Also, the original credit I gave the author for his willingness to kill off some popular, central characters has turned sour as now it seems like everyone must die and we are left with characters who have not been fully developed are have too few pages dedicated to them. Hopefully the author will wrap this up neatly in the next book and be done with it!

0345803485|1.0|Like so many other reviewers, I cannot believe that this book is so popular and is still clinging to the Best-Seller List after all this time.<br /><br />How can this piece of rudimentary drivel can appeal to so many people?  After all, it is ridiculously repetitive, horribly structured, and appallingly written (\\"Oh my, I think I just used more variation in writing one sentence than the author did in hundreds of pages,\\" I murmur while cocking my head to one side and flushing 50 shades of crimson).<br />Considering the fact that this book was meant to target an older, moderately educated and more or less well-read population, it is infuriating to discover it was written this way and was somehow still well-received.<br /><br />At least the Mormon lady who wrote Twilight wrote it for hormone-infested idealistic teenagers...<br />This lady, on the other hand, doesn't have the same excuse and should very well be ashamed of herself.<br /><br />Most reviewers touched on the redundancy of this \\"novel\\", yet I must address the unbearably unrealistic aspect of this book:<br /><br />A 21-year-old VIRGIN majoring in English Lit. falling hopelessly in love with a SLIGHTLY older self-made BILIONARE (who instantly cannot live without her and who is, of course, all kinds of perfect), goes on a sexual journey towards what I assume is going to be a fairy-tale ending (I cannot bear reading the other two books, but am sure this will obviously happen)...<br /><br />First of all, this is taking place in 2011 right? I mean, that's what it says... How the hell is this girl still a virgin? And how is she so excited about the aspect of BDSM when she was never even touched in the first place??<br /><br />Speaking of BDSM, I must admit I was a bit excited to read about things I never tried myself (the \\"contract\\" was actually mildly entertaining),  but was utterly disappointed to see that all the sex was taken from corny romance novels about naughty upper-class ladies from 19'th century England.Wouldn't one assume that if the promise of kinky sex is implicit, the author would deliver on said promise?  I'm no pervert, but I am fairly certain that constant spanking is not exactly what BDSM is all about.  For how much the main character whined about being a submissive or whatever, she definitely talked far more than walked.  It was incredibly annoying.<br /><br />In addition, please tell me (I beg you), how did both of them manage to have so much friggin' sex and so many friggin' orgasms without fainting and\or having a heart attack?  I know for a fact that most people cannot have so much sex and/or orgasms without some sort of hormonal misbalance and a whole lot of free time coupled with tons of performance-enhancing drugs.<br /><br />And let us not get to the whole \\"look at me, I found the perfect job right away with my degree in uselessness...\\"  Don't get me wrong, I got my bachelors in English AND Communications myself, but had to go back to school and take classes in science because there were NO JOBS.  Did no one tell this BRITISH lady the economy here sucks?  What is up with this picture-perfect scenario?  I am pretty sure the genre wasn't fantasy, so why did it not make ANY SENSE???<br /><br />Moreover, shouldn't one write about places one is familiar with?  I am positive the author just googled street names and famous places in Oregon\Washington State\Georgia because even though I've never been to these states, I am damn sure none of it is actually the way she described.<br />To be honest, I was incredibly pissed at the daftness of her descriptions, like \\"this is how America is supposed to be like, right?\\"<br />Well, maybe you should visit before deciding that we live our lives exactly how they show it in 50's sitcoms (minus the humping, of course).<br /><br />Common lady, get real!  We are no longer teenagers here (I hope, because I'd hate teenagers to think this is how life and screwing is actually like).<br /><br />Also, I really hated the special \\"consideration\\" she gave to \\"diverse\\" characters; \\"African American\\" pretty receptionist with hoop earrings, and a fiery Latin-American \\"Jose\\" who says \\"dios mio\\"... Really?? How come none of the Caucasian characters had to be described as \\"White-Americans\\" with blonde hair and blue eyes? Are we stupid enough to not realize that if you name a character \\"Jose\\" he is most likely Hispanic?<br />\\"Oh triple crap\\", I whisper as I roll my eyes.<br /><br />OK, I obviously let a bit of steam here, so I am sorry for this extremely long review (it is my first time caring enough to actually write something), So to make a long story short, DO NOT WASTE YOU MONEY!  Unless you get this for free and really need a day to feel stupid, there is no need to encourage this lady to write any more and make her even more undeservedly rich.  Let us not repeat the Stephanie Mayer fiasco.
B005ZMUXDC|5.0|The artistry is fantastic! Highly detailed and the facial expressions very life-like. The story is well done and very entertaining. I have watched it many times and find something new in it every time. I enjoy all the songs as well and just have to sing along. Definitely a Disney Classic and very funny!
0743298039|5.0|Oh my, I loved this book. It is woven like a fine tapestry, one thread at a time, adding color and texture as you go. I am sure that the beginning of a weaving is a bit drab and unfocused until the pattern emerges and starts forming before your eyes. Thus, for me, it was with this book.<br /><br />I actually started it a year ago and put it down because I couldn't seem to get in to it but the book was highly praised by a friend whose judgement I respect so I decided to give it another try. Am I glad I did. Once the two protagonists meet and you start to hear the life story of the elderly protagonist there is no stopping.<br /><br />\\"I will tell the story my way, in order. No questions, no jumping around,\\" warns Vida Winter, the beloved author whose life story is being recorded for the first time. And tell it she does. Of course, she's never told the truth before when it comes to her story so can we be sure what we're hearing now is the truth, the whole truth?<br /><br />Corroborating stories lend a Roshoman-esque quality at times but it is the growing relationship between the author and her biographer that really sets the scene. The story grows steadily as more color and texture is added and just when you think you know the whole story a new thread is introduced and the pattern is enhanced and becomes even more vibrant. This is a story I was sorry to see end.<br /><br />Do you believe in ghosts?
B008Z9YLV2|2.0|I know that transforming a good book into a movie is a difficult thing to do, and though I thought Lord of the Rings was exceptionally good for instance, it still fell far short of actually reading the books.  But this was not that good at all and could have been so much better.  I am not sure that some of the very favorable reviewers really understand what makes a good movie and what makes an average one.  I shouldn't be surprised I suppose, the droves of people that descend upon the nearest cineplex based on hyped advertising for extremely poor films is a sad reflection of the discernment or lack of it out there.<br /><br />Anyway to the film itself.  What really spoilt this film for me was that if felt rushed, and the characters and story were very badly developed.  Having read the book, I knew who everyone was,  but I hate to think how I would have been puzzled had I not read it.  An best example of this is in the characters of the other tributes.  I can hardly remember a single one of them and they certainly had no character to speak of.  The story was also rushed and plagued with poor continuity.  Some of the acting was wooden and stilted.  Lenny Kravitz and even some of the tributes were very one dimensional and unsympathetic.<br /><br />All in all, this was a big disappointment that probably suffers from those responsible having got away with making millions from the mediocre Twilight series.  Unfortunately, we are all to blame - we flock to see these things and buy the DVDs whether they are good or not because we just have to see/own them because they have cult status.  In the case of Twilight, how can you be a tween female and not swoon over Edward and Bella.  The same goes for The Hunger Games.  A fairly well written trilogy gains cult status and so the film automatically makes millions whether it is any good or not.  I just hate to think what they are going to do with 50 shades of boredom.  That's not even that well written from all I hear - but as i have not read the books I'll reserve judgment - it just seems we have turned into a race of 'me too' followers who can't resist jumping on the bandwagon, whose contents are usually a big disappointment, but we carry on and make these mediocre artistes filthy rich!<br /><br />C'est la vie!  I watched it too - but I will not be watching or buying the DVD!
1583334386|5.0|Most books about willpower and discipline give trite, useless platitudes and examples. Dr McGonigal uses science and her professional experience to reiterate the important aspects of willpower as well as bring counter-intuitive ideas about willpower. I recommend this for all readers.
B001HN6922|3.0|As much as our entire family loved the first installment of Cars, we were rather disappointed with Cars 2.  In plain words, it feels like mixed salad - too many ingredients i.e. characters, the plot is not clear, and the dialogue is rather poor.  That said, I will probably not buy the third installment of \\"Cars.\\"
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love this version of solitaire! I love the options it gives you and its images are great. Highly recommend this for solitaire lovers.
B008MG1E4A|3.0|I had mixed feelings about purchasing and reading this book. I saw `Mark' interviewed, but I wanted to see why a Seal would write a book about a Seal mission. I thought there was a code among the Seals, so I googled and found this sentence included in the Seals code: \\"I do not advertise the nature of my work, nor seek recognition for my actions.\\" My concern was about a Seal writing about a Seal mission.<br /><br />But . . . I admit I was curious, and there is nothing better than reading a first-hand account of any event. I have always respected the Seals for what they do. These men are exceptional American heroes, and I am glad they are working for me every day. Like the title states, Seals have No Easy Day. Therefore, I didn't see the necessity to humanize the Seals in the way `Mark' did. There was no reason to share their senseless pranks in a book such as this.<br /><br />`Mark' also states this isn't a political book. Yet, he mentions more than once about the Washington machine (his words) being slow in the decision-making, and how the military doesn't have all they need. He comments on American tax dollars paying for a nice paved road, that isn't in America.<br /><br />`Mark' describes how he became a Seal; this degraded the Seals high standards, because he makes it sound like he barely made it. I don't understand why he included this detailed information.<br /><br />After reading, No Easy Day, I'm still not sure why `Mark' wrote this book. I hope there's nothing more sinister behind it except the monetary gain. No one wants to see repercussions for any of the Seals and their families.<br /><br />The book was well written, and I did learn a few things from reading, No Easy Day:<br /><br />1. Seals should not get married. If the job comes before family, they shouldn't have a family.<br /><br />2. I wasn't aware how much the Seals dislike President Obama.<br /><br />3. Osama Bin Laden was more of a coward than I originally thought.
B007R0Y7VO|4.0|I loved this movie!  I never thought I could get so emotional over a movie with a horse being the main character.  You could just feel the raw emotion of the people and horses come to life through your T.V.  I would watch this movie again and again.
B007UPNA6Y|4.0|The Jack Reacher books are by far my favorite series to read and the only book I sit counting down the days waiting for but I do have 2 gripes thus far.<br />1) For the time being I have had enough of Reacher's escapades being set in the country, bring back a city setting.<br />2) How many damn detours is Jack going to come across on his way to meeting Miss Virginia girl? I understand the thrill of anticipation but I don't think I can stand one more book dragging this out any further.<br /><br />Aside from this, A Wanted Man had plenty of Jack's delicious wit and cunning and of course a good helping of Jack tenaciously kicking the bad guys asses. The plot kept you guessing although the ending was perhaps a bit anticlimactic and glum, with all explanations/revelations made rather quickly as if we were running out of room in the book. But it was all in there and A Wanted Man certainly didn't disappoint, so bring on the next one!<br />Although I will say, this latest book did give me an eerie sense that we may be approaching our heroes inevitable demise...?
B0055MI8K2|1.0|Bought these for my husband who LOVED his Terra Fi 3 SN 6670 and wore them until they literally fell off his feet. He was so excited when he got these and then a few days later told me that they are not the Terras he knows and that there must be something wrong. I looked around and nothing is to be found except these. He says the support is not nearly as good, they are stiff and rigid and he feels his ankles and foot arches are not nearly as happy. So all I can say, we need some big changes to the way it was before.
B005LAIH2W|5.0|Loved this movie.  Because they didn't market this film right, it didn't do well at the boxoffice.  It was not the films fault as it is and exciting, well acted and terrific film.  Great special effects, nice story and deserves to be seen by every scifi fan around.  If you haven't seen it, buy it or rent it and watch it today,  you won't be sorry.
B004LWZW6U|3.0|Writing a straight-up serious review of PIRANHA 3DD is a bit beside the point.  Plot means little; something about a guy opening an adult-themed waterpark, his step-daughter opposed to the changes he's made, and suddenly the prehistoric fish from PIRANHA 3D show up and make a mess of things.  That's it, there you go, a few romantic angles thrown in--some predictably touching, some there for nothing other than nudity and graphic violence.  Oh, and humor--bucket loads of dark humor, just like with any horror comedy.<br /><br />PIRANHA 3DD isn't quite as funny/enjoyable as its predecessor, if only because we've been here before and know what to expect (what a great ending, by the way; not quite surprising, but still gutsy enough to feel new).  The acting is what it should be--over-the-top from the supporting cast, more authentic and realistic from the main pair (Danielle Panabaker and Matt Bush).  We've got David Koechner doing his thing; Christopher Lloyd back from the first one; Gary Busey making a nice intro cameo; and especially David Hasselhoff, doing probably the best role of his career--himself (he also comes away with some of the film's funnier lines).  The effects are predictably modern-cheesy (I didn't see the 3D version; still not convinced it's the wave of the cinematic future), and the script and direction are similar to the first.<br /><br />That's basically the gist: if you liked PIRANHA 3D, you'll like PIRANHA 3DD.  It's for those of us who don't always take our movies seriously.  It's a break from the Oscar-worthy dramas and the horror films that take themselves far too seriously.  If you like movies that focus on gore, nudity, and humor, then check out PIRANHA 3DD.  If you don't...well, no harm no foul, but you'd be best to look elsewhere for your evening's popcorn entertainment.
B002SS8S7E|5.0|Hadn't seen the movie. Wanted to catch up prior to seeing the latest at the theaters.  I'll buy the series as I was really impressed.
B008S4YZCO|5.0|very good game. I would download more from gameloft! monster life is one of the many few I would rate five stars though:)
B004LWZW7Y|5.0|This is a very cute movie and very family appropriate.  I bought it for my granddaughter and she loved it.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I did like the story line of this book. It kept you wanting to know what was going to happen next. I, however, thought the over abundance of sex was annoying. Not that I am against it. But it was like...oh we just had breakfast, lets have sex...oh we walked down the hallway, lets have sex. It was a little ridiculous. But I have recommended the book to others. Oh and the \\"Inner Goddess\\" thing is so obnoxious. There is so much repetition in this book.
B008MG1E4A|3.0|If you're read other Navy SEAL books (like Lone Survivor) a lot of the what-it's-like-to-be-a-SEAL stuff you've heard before, and that's sort of what the first half is, aside from a teasing first chapter that's about the OBL raid.<br /><br />But boy, when the author writes about first getting strange clues they're about to go on the mission of a lifetime, it just motors from there.  You can't put it down.  I read it in one day.  Fascinating stuff, and some humorous anecdotes about SEAL ideology are sprinkled throughout.<br /><br />It's not quite on the level of Black Hawk Down or Bravo Two Zero, but it's a good, fast read.  You'll learn a few things that contradict the \\"official\\" story of the raid (all of which have been in the media before the book even came out), but nothing that will reveal the official story as a fabrication from top to bottom.<br /><br />It definitely reinforces the idea that the Navy SEALS are just the best of the best.  I didn't even realize prior to reading this that there was an elite SEAL group within the SEALS themselves--and that's who was on this mission.<br /><br />Well done.
B004LTA9MK|3.0|CD is advertised as having 13 songs on it, but when listen to, it only has 9 songs and reads as disc #1. Which must mean there is a disc 2 and makes the package incomplete. Very unsatisfied, which I would  have noticed this before I left positive feedback.
B008MEM24S|5.0|This is not a paid opinion.  This game is very addictive.  The controls are simple and the game is challenging.  It was $.99 well spent!
B008N9AASC|5.0|...of this film a few days ago. the director, the producer & the composer of the score were all there<br />taking questions & making comments afterwards. i took a little posse with me...we were 5 total.<br />it's fair to say that, between the 5 of us, our tastes run a bit varied. i say this to illustrate<br />just how hands down amazing this film is. we all came out bewildered. it's a truly<br />amazing piece of work in all possible ways. i urge everyone to see it.
B006OCM0G0|2.0|I've noticed that my money is constantly disappearing, usually when i leave and when i cook. it would be great if you could fix that.
B008N1LL42|2.0|This is clearly a child's movie.  The aliens were unrealistically vulnerable and aren't frightening in the least.  The script contains no thought provoking dialogue, however, the special effects are great.  If you are 14 or younger, this would be an OK show.
B000SEGUDE|5.0|I love reading books that are refreshingly unique and surprising, and Cloud Atlas is definitely one of them.  Cloud Atlas consists of six chapters set in six different and ascending time periods, with the first five ending halfway through in cliffhangers.  Each story involves a character discovering the previous chapter/time period's story in various forms, and just like the reader, each main character finds only half of the previous story.  But have no fear, the sixth chapter is told in completion and then the next five revisit the remaining five stories in reverse order, picking up the cliffhangers and carrying them to the end.<br /><br />After a strong recommendation from a close friend with similar reading tastes, I gave Cloud Atlas a try and was initially very turned off by it.  Mitchell gives each chapter a distinct voice, which often means frustrating dialects, and many chapters are written as diary entries or letters, which often means cryptic references or shorthands.  Thanks to the encouragement of my friend I pushed through and found that while I may not always like the main characters or the style of writing in a particular chapter, I loved the stories and layered themes.  I was also impressed that Mitchell could write these chapters/short stories in such difference voices and styles and yet snake through them continuations, linking them all together.  There are a lot of themes running through these chapters, especially about human nature and cyclical patterns, but for the sake of avoiding any spoilers, I won't go into any further detail except to point out my least and favorite chapters.  I won't include any real spoilers, but if you don't want to know anything about the individual stories and want to be surprised when you start each chapter then don't read any further...My least favorite chapter was probably the Cavendish one - I just couldn't get invested in the character and while the story was entertaining it seemed almost like filler to me.  My favorite chapter was the Sonmi one, set in a futuristic South Korea filled with clones that are created to perform the more menial tasks.  Sonmi's world was not only fascinating, but her story was exciting, dark, deep, and nail bitingly tense at times.  I also found her to be one of the most interesting and complex main characters.<br /><br />Each chapter definitely has its highs and lows, but taken as a whole Cloud Atlas is an amazing read.  I couldn't put it down and would've finished it faster if only I didn't have the stupid inconvenience of going to work.  I highly recommend you give this book a try, and please give it a fair shot at grabbing your interest because that first chapter can be a bit of a turn-off at first.  But if you're in the mood for a good read (not some sort of light and fluffy brain candy, but a more complex and interesting read), then start with chapter one of Cloud Atlas and don't stop until you hit the end of chapter six.  If you still don't like it and don't care how each of the stories will end then sure put it aside and move on to another book. But I seriously doubt that will happen.orite chapter was the Sonmi one, set in a futuristic South Korea filled with clones that are created to perform the more menial tasks.

0345528581|4.0|When I first saw some of the workout routines and exercises suggested, I thought I had wasted my money on the book but, once I actually gave them a chance and started on the programs, I found them to be a challenge and something I could really use as a bodyweight workout program.<br />The book has now become my official exercise bible. The workout routines are simple to follow yet physically challenging. And he leaves you room to adjust the difficulty of each exercise to fit your own level of ability.<br />The beginning of the book spent a little too much time trying to convince me why his way is the best way. As if he was trying to sell me a product I have already bought. And, on some of the exercises, could have used a little more detailed description on proper form so that I could make sure I was doing them right.<br />Still, a worthwhile investment for someone looking to exercise without having weights or a gym membership.
1609611543|5.0|First 2 weeks: 10 lbs lost, starting from 250lbs. Eating better food, experimenting with new, and researching new ways of preparation. Without any wheat flour products.<br />  For the average layperson, Dr. Davis' book can be heavy technical reading, but the later chapters are the most guiding information about weight loss program. We just ordered his other book for additional information, so I can get to the 40-50 lbs loss that's my goal.
B00127RAJY|4.0|I just finished this DVD before moving on to the next one. This kicked my butt! I would recommend that anyone who isn't used to exercising start by walking or something first to get used to it. I was a little disappointed with level 3, as level 2 was probably the most difficult (for me, anyways). Overall, I really liked this DVD, though, and I lost over 10 pounds in less than 2 months using it combined with Yoga Meltdown. :)

0525953728|4.0|I have to split this review in two parts. The first is the content of the book, and the second is if it should have even been written.<br /><br />First off the story. Beautifully written it spreads the hugely detailed narrative of the Osama raid throughout the book building to a huge finale that I couldn't wait to get to, in fact I read the book in one sitting. In between you are filled with the author's account of how he became a Team Six SEAL and a myriad of other missions he participated in during more than a decade of service, all of which was in non-stop, front line combat. The men of SEAL Team Six are without question the very tip of our spear and are executing in a way that seems directly from a movie but of course isn't. What these men are doing for our nation on a daily basis is told in a very moving way. The book is a wonderful read.<br /><br />The second part is if this book should have even been written. The very nature of the elite teams of the US military, the Navy SEALS (in particular their Team Six) and the Army Delta Force,  have lived in a black ops world where the idea is you preform in service of country, you seek no recognition for, and you simply don't talk about it. Over the decades the SEALs have lowered these standards (some, but far less books on Delta Force have been released) and over the last decade literally dozens of books have been released detailing their lives, many of them bestsellers. This book has really pushed the farthest revealing blow by blow much of how the biggest raids, like the Osama raid, are executed. While the author makes pains to not glorify himself in particular, it strikes as disingenuous his attacks on senior Officers and President Obama that they inappropriately were leaking details of their operations for Political gain (which I agree with) but failing to see that it is easy to construe the very authorship of the book a year after the raid as the same.<br /><br />In a way I wish these secrets remained secrets, but they are out there, and this book is a beautifully written account of a hidden world of men who protect our nation daily while we go about our lives, enjoying the freedom they provide.

B008KWHM6U|2.0|I loved the first album so I bought this second without previewing it closely based on the fact they showed so much talent on Tourist History.<br /><br />So far I've played the album twice and both times haven't been able to finish listening to it. It's not horrible but it doesn't contain the elements that grabbed me on the first album. The electronic drums have been replaced by a real drummer so they sound more indie than electro pop. There's also a lot less of the earnest upbeat numbers and more wishy washy crooning. So for me they've gone from an exciting upbeat electro pop band to a so-so indie group. If you're like me and tend towards the harder rock, techno, electro, trance side of music this is fair warning you should give it a good preview before buying. There's no \\"Do You Want It All?\\" and \\"I Can Talk\\" on this album.
B007L3BMGA|4.0|What a great story! Sexy and relatable! I thoroughly enjoyed the story line and kept me wanting more. I have fallen in love with Ana and Christian and sign me up for any other Christians out there:p Great way to escape reality would (and have) recommend to all!

I appreciated the humor in this book, especially since it there were several heavy topics. I loved the romance in this book; it was sweet, it was electric, it was frustrating, it was worth seeing how it played out. It was a worthwhile read.

B008MG1E4A|5.0|If you're looking for an entertaining, easy to read, impossible to put down, military related book, this is it.  If you're looking for SOF secrets revealed or political points/blame to be made, you're going to be disappointed.<br /><br />This is a first hand account of a former SEAL's missions and training including the taking of the UBL compound.  It details his personal hopes and dreams, successes and failures, strengths and weaknesses.  It's his story, told from his viewpoint.  It's his attempt to tell the most sensationalized, politicized and publicized military operation in recent memory from the standpoint of someone who was actually there.<br /><br />Frankly, I don't think anyone who doesn't have an interest in or connection with the military will enjoy this.  Although he explains the acronyms as he goes along they could confuse a reader unfamiliar with their use.  As a veteran I liked the feel of being part of a mission again.  I was along for the ride.<br /><br />Sine Pari

It takes you right back to the best of the early 1970's prog rock: Genesis, Yes, Jethro Tull, but with a distinct sound of their own. This is a very English album with a beautiful sound, created by some very talented musicians. If you only buy one album this year, make it this one ....but then you'll want to buy the back catalogue as well.<br /><br />If I could give it 10 stars I would!<br /><br />English Electric 2 is out next year (2013).....can't wait.

B003O86FMW|4.0|This was just a good book in my opinion. I tore through it like the other two of this trilogy. These are not the kind of books I usually read, but a friend suggested it and I'm glad she did. I surprisingly enjoyed the movie as well. Not that the writing is similar, but it took my back to when I was a kid when I enjoyed reading Stephen King.haha

Extremely entertaining, with pretty good character development considering how many actors made this a good movie. Nice ending, especially after all that the lead actor had been through. Beware; there is a lot of blood and gore. The movie didn't hide how brutal hand to hand combat is. It was not gratuitous violence, combat is what it is and this is a movie of bravery and war.<br /><br />The movie seems to imply at the end that there will be a sequel. I doubt it, but this left me satisfied enough.

B007JM4CWY|5.0|I love this game! the puzzles range from easy to hard. the first time I played I had to do some research on how to play..but once I figured it out, I loved it! tons of puzzles and they're always adding more!
B007SGM084|5.0|I'm not a reader but I read all three of the books loved them<br />These books are not for teens to read
B007HJ84ZK|5.0|I don't have HBO but am a HUGE fan of A Song of Ice and Fire book series so I've been watching a Game of Thrones through amazon and its GREAT. Its the closest adaptation of a book I've seen so far. I am so glad the creators decided to go with an in depth series instead of a movie that would have left out too much of the story. Now people that haven't read George R.R. Martin's amazing tale can get a quality story extremely close to the books :)
0307730697|5.0|This book is well worth reading.  This soldier's life story is a journey that falls to the depths of despair and addiction and then reaches the heights of success in his faith, his family, and his role as one of our elite Navy Seals.  It is an inspiring life story that will challenge each of us to see beyond ourselves, to love harder, to realize anything really is possible, and to truly honor those soldiers that serve our country.<br />Much praise to the author for a wonderful job telling this story.  I will look for his other books!
B008IYR2BA|5.0|Season after season this show has more than impressed me, it actually sucks to end a season because you want to see the next season right away.<br />Anyways season 6 comes back with incredible twists, unexpected outcomes, and of course dexter is walking a fine line between his dark side and his work. A new cerial murderer is in miami claiming to \\"begin the apocalypse\\" according tithe book of exodus in the bible. And I haven't seen a conclusion to a season as good as this one since season 4.<br />I honestly thought they couldn't keep dragging this show on, BUT IT KEEPS GETTING BETTER!<br />Definately worth watching.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I was so glad to finally have a Pinterest app for my Kindle Fire. Others have mentioned problems logging in but I haven't had any issues. I just wish there was an easy way to pin on the Kindle. :)

1451627297|4.0|A very entertaining novel. There were a lot of side plots that<br />slowed down the reading. Overall, it was very entertaining.
B00866H7SS|4.0|A great book, you get caught up in the characters lives, There are sex scences but they are normal and easy to read, not disturbing like some other books I've read.<br />Cant wait for the next one
B006LSZECO|5.0|Like the title said, I loved reading this book.  It was the very definition of a page turner....couldn't wait to see what was coming next.  I especially liked Part 2 of the novel when a new narrator steps in.  He/she was so delightfully hate-able, but sooooo hilarious (and filthy...seriously, if you are offended by naughty language, don't read this book).<br />It's hard to review a mystery/thriller, since anything you say could be considered a spoiler.<br /><br />If you like a twisty turny story filled with characters that can be difficult to sympathize with, I think you'll enjoy this book.  As for the ending, it's not what I would have wanted, but I suppose it fit (sorry for the vagueness, if you want more detail, I could go into it in the comments section).
B003TH2LA8|3.0|I'm a bit of a fantasy and science-fiction geek, and also a bit of a movie nerd. So I tend to have fairly strong opinions about everything from plot and setting to cinematography and special effects. Because of this background, my tastes and my opinion may not jibe with yours; YMMV.<br />I should probably also make it clear here that I've never read the original series of books; this is not a post-partum rant from a fan.<br /><br />Legend Of The Seeker had some earmarks that perked my interest - magic, a quest, a wise-cracking wizard, an enchanted sword, and cackling evil. YAY!<br /><br />Unfortunately I found out that the magic was a panacea, the quest was basically to kill the wicked witch of the west, the wise-cracking wizard was more the non-sequitur-spouting wizard, and the cackling evil was more along the lines of evil for evil's sake, which I find kind of boring in an M.Bison kind of way ('OF COURSE!').<br /><br />For those who think that Game of Thrones is an excellent, mesmerizing display of everything that a fantasy series should be, in both book and televised format - I agree.<br />This is not that series. And it will not live up to that level of scrutiny. Seeker doesn't deserve to be mentioned in the same breath, and here's why:<br /><br /> -The plot is swiss cheese, made of equal parts cheese and holes. I especially love how the characters keep on finding each other pretty much instantly, in the middle of vast stretches of<br />wilderness, whenever the plot wheezily suggests they might have three lines to say to each other - in spite of the fact that the bad guys can't seem to find the good guys, and vice versa, in same.<br /><br /> -The acting is mediocre at best, and at worst, reminiscent of Eragon. Bruce himself couldn't save the lines that Raimi forces these actors to say, though, so all blame cannot rest with the actors.<br /><br /> -The special effects were decent, but certainly not anything to write home about, given the levels of technical expertise on display in such series as BSG and GOT.<br /><br /> -I have been given no reason to root for the main character; he's a cardboard cutout of a hero, saying all the right things without ever seeming to mean them or having a valid reason to say them, and as such, the battle scenes leave me cold; I just don't care whether good or evil wins the fight.<br /><br />But you knew all this going in. It's a Raimi series, and once corrections are made for the source material and technological advancements, it plays like every other Raimi series - shoddily produced, played for laughs at inappropriate moments... I could go on, but I won't. If you like what Raimi does to the other works he's produced since Army of Darkness, then by all means, jump on in, the water's lukewarm as always. If you don't, then I'd suggest staying the bleep away.
B0057A6GA6|4.0|i really enjoy this game a lot. I'm waiting for them to update it with more levels as I've beat it already! but it took me a long time to beat so it has great play value.

B004J4WLB4|4.0|I Loved this book.I am a gardener, but even if you aren't the meanings of<br />flowers and the language a young girl learned who had no family to belong to<br />was an amazing read.  The young girls life in foster care, the woman who wanted<br />to be her mother and finally the work she could find in floral design using<br />the language of flowers is an inspiring read.  A surprise love story, with the<br />thorns evident but ultimately removed.  This is a book you will love and lots<br />of visions of flowers you will remember.
B004T0E2S8|5.0|bought this a few months back. use it on the kindle fire. granted anyone with common sense would just go to the site right? well once you log in you don't need wi-fi to access your favorites--which there is now a button for. very simple layout and navigation.and to anyone who doesn't know ultimate guitar they have every variation of every song you could imagine. its measly 3 bucks anyhow..beyond worth it.
B00913DPW2|4.0|I really enjoyed this game. Well worth the $1.99 Great scenery and puzzles. Can't. wait for the next one which is supposed to be out around Halloween.
0525953728|5.0|Great Book and what a dedicated group fully focused on their mission and not distracted by the DNC political machine who would like to write Obama into the decision making process.  We all know he was on the golf course and in no way supportive of killing a Mid eastern terrorist of the muslim faith.  Was this terrorists actions just \\"workplace violence\\" like the Ft. Hood murderer?  Give this administration enough time and they will re-write the real history of a terrorist who evaded Bill Clinton and George W. Bush.  Great book, great team and thanks you SEALS for taking this bad guy out for once and for all!
B005ZKYXZI|5.0|I really like this movie. The only problem that I had encounter is that having a movie theater speakers I can not enjoy the English multichannel. The sound is only stereo. I have 4 speakers and the sub-woofer but when I play the movie (blu ray disc) I just get and stereo sound. When I play the French language or Spanish the sound comes for all the speakers and is sound great, just the English version had that problem. Now for those who think that the Disc maybe damage I can tell you that I buy another to see is that was the problem but it have the same issue. But the DVD version is Ok is only the blu ray that came with that. Is there any body having this problem?
B007549W62|4.0|The bomb/fallout shelter environment depicted in \\"The Divide\\" is graphically presented. Unexplained (plot weakness 4-star justification) intrusion by armed raiders raises everyone's violence level beyond paranoia, and beyond growing annoyance with short rations (the divide) and with tedium. But \\"The Divide\\" recalls issues discussed during the 1960s fallout shelter craze: \\"Who is in and who is out?\\" In The Great Recession's Wake IMO surviving homeowners surrounded by foreclosures face similar questions because the homeless often react badly to \\"Go home!\\"

B0092MKFIY|5.0|The only thing that I don't llike about this album is that the songs \\"Nothingleft to say\\" and \\"rocks\\" are combined into one track, which is annoying when  Iwant to listen to Rocks andneed to FFW through the other song until I find it.<br /><br />Other than that I love everything about this Album.
B000PKG7I4|5.0|Listened to the radio every day from 2002 to 2011, but never heard Amy Winehouse songs played until a collegue played her on his ipod during work in 2012.

She would have given the world many more musical treasures if she had had the time. RIP Amy.

B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Mockingjay by Suzanne Collins<br /><br />The conclusion to the epic series, The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins.<br /><br />STOP READING NOW IF YOU DO NOT WANT SPOILERS FOR THE FIRST TWO BOOKS!<br /><br />You can read my review of the first book by clicking here, and the second book by clicking here.<br /><br />Mockingjay by Suzanne Collins concludes the series, and the story of Katniss Everdeen in Panem.  The second book left off with a horrible cliff-hanger with Katniss being removed from the Hunger Games stadium before the games were even completed.<br /><br />Katniss finds herself awaking in the hospital and discovers she is now in District 13, a District which does really exist.  And much to her great sorrow, most of District 12 and most of its inhabitants have been killed as the Capitol goes on its quest to subdue all of the districts, destroying the ones who do not obey.<br /><br />Katniss' family has escaped and her best friend, Gale, is safe too, but the boy she was beginning to fall for, Peeta, was not rescued from the stadium at the games, and now he is being tortured and controlled by The Capitol as a weapon, one which they intend to use directly against Katniss.<br /><br />Katniss discovers the rebellion and learns of its plans to overthrow the Capitol, and to begin by gaining control of each district one-by-one.  And it is Katniss.  Katniss Everdeen that they choose to have as their leader, their symbols, their Mockingjay.  The sight of which brings strength and power to all those who see her.<br /><br />And yet Katniss is torn apart, tortured by the thought of what is happening to Peeta and destroyed by the new control under which she finds herself and her life.  Overwhelmed by guilt that but-for her, most of District 12 would still be alive...<br /><br />Will the rebellion be successful in convincing Katniss to be their symbol?  And will Katniss have the strength to cooperate?  And what of Peeta, locked up in the Capitol and being tortured by President Snow in order to break Katniss?  Will their efforts be successful, or is there something much, much, much more sinister at work?<br /><br />Read Mockingjay to find out!<br /><br />Definitely the least favorite of the 3 books in my opinion.<br /><br />Katniss is basically completely broken, and you no longer see the strong young woman, the one who volunteered as tribute to save her baby sister.  Instead it's all self-pity, self-loathing, and more self-pity.  It makes it hard to empathize with her.<br /><br />Yes, she's been through more than any of us can have imagined.  1.5 hunger games, and seeing the man she loves locked up and knowing he's being tortured.  But she's so self-pitying it's almost hard to read.<br /><br />It took me a lot longer to finish this book than it did for me to finish the other two.  The first two I almost couldn't put down!  And when the second ended on such a cliffhanger, I couldn't help but start the 3rd immediately.<br /><br />Maybe there's something in me that always hates seeing a good series end (ask me how I feel about the epilogue in Harry Potter #7) but I really think it's more than that with this book.  Mockingjay just simply isn't as good, isn't as captivating and isn't as compelling.<br /><br />We meet a few more interesting characters, see a lot of the same old ones, and the tired attempts at twists just don't quite do it for me.<br /><br />And yet, if you've read this much of the series you really should finish the third.<br /><br />All in all for this book alone, 3 out of 5 stars.<br /><br />For the series as a whole though, 4 out of 5, largely carried by the first book, The Hunger Games.nt Snow in order to break Katniss?

B007PT3QOQ|4.0|It's fun but I dislike how I cannot do certain things unless I contact friends to also play the game or spend real money.  I'm not interested in doing either.
B007Y6OZE0|3.0|This certainly isn't a bad record and it's not nearly as horrible as their last output, but it isn't exactly The Offspring's best either.  There are some really good tunes on here, such as \\"Secrets from the Underground\\", \\"Hurting as One\\", \\"Dividing by Zero\\" and \\"Slim Pickens\\".  Hell, I even like \\"I Wanna Secret Family With You\\".  But there are other songs that aren't exactly great, like \\"Cruising California (Bumpin' in my Trunk)\\" which is the worst song they've ever written.  Yeah, I realize it's a joke, but it's a pretty poor one.  Then there's \\"OC Guns\\", which is highly grating as well.  The rest of the songs are alright, but nothing to write home about.  I guess you could say this is a typical post-\\"Americana\\" release, where half of it is pretty good and the other half is...well, meh.  The only album to break this pattern was \\"Rise and Fall, Rage and Grace\\" and that was only because nearly every song on there was awful.  This one's definitely a couple steps above that.  Overall, it's alright but the 12 bucks I paid for it feels wasted.  Get \\"Smash\\", \\"Ignition\\" or the self-titled album before this one as those are their best - \\"Ixnay\\" and \\"Americana\\" are also solid.

B006M7JCC2|5.0|I am so grateful to the lovely Anita; to the the best teacher in the world- Wayne Dyer; and to Hays House for making this story available.  I felt (and still feel) some of the strongest emotions of my life ..especially joy and affirmation.  I wanted to jump up and shout 'I knew it! I knew it!  I think we all do deep inside, but we let that 'knowing'  erode away until it's totally buried.  Rediscovery of something so precious is the greatest joy...Thank you
B001GSTOAM|4.0|I know Bob would say that a developer needs to know as many languages as they can get their hands on but the truth is I am not yet the master coder this book is urging us to be. I can't fault him for making all his samples in Java, that is one of the most common languages today, but the amount of code he forces us to slog through would make it tiresome even for a native Java coder.<br /><br />With that aside, there is a lot of great content here. I wish I had a chance to read it years ago. I've struggled with my concept of what a developer should be when compared to the state of software development today. At times I would feel like my dedication to technical excellence was at odds with what matters to business. This book helped me realize that not only was I right to try to raise the bar but that I was still setting the bar too low.<br /><br />This books is just a beginning in that it paves the road to becoming a professional developer. It contains a number of concepts that should be studied and applied but it also urges you to continue the journey beyond what is covered in the book.<br /><br />Some would argue that he sets the bar too high and that this will cause frustration for developers. But the fact is, it is apathy and lack of professionalism in our industry that causes the most angst. Most true developers want to be better than they are but often struggle with the culture that derides that type of commitment.<br /><br />I remember scoffing at those developers who would discuss design patterns thinking that they were not interested in real work. I mocked Test Driven Development as a fad and a waste of time. It was only after years of struggling with unmanageable code did I realize that something was fundamentally wrong with how code usually got written. Even then it took a few years of applying proper OO principles and Test Driven Development for me to truly believe the value of disciplined practices - my code works.

0393338827|5.0|Incredible as it may seem, Michael Lewis has managed to write a book about economics that actually crackles with energy, emotion, human interest, plot, and character development and makes the subject as clear as a bell. The very next thing I'm going to do is get my hands on \\"Liar's Poker\\", his earlier work.<br /><br />My takeaways from the book: (1) It's the bond market, not the stock market, that sunk the economy. (2) The stock market is open, well-regulated, and can be participated in by most of us; the bond market is closed, essentially unregulated, deceptive, and closed to all but the wealthy, corporations and investment banks. (3) Shorting stocks carries unlimited risk. But shorting bonds using the deceptively-named credit default swaps carries very little risk that remains fixed. (4) The bond rating agencies were both duped and part of the game; they are essentially worthless. (5) Extreme avarice and simple unchecked greed underlie it all. (6) The dumb and the crooked were rewarded, and handsomely so; never blamed or punished. Now I know why I never really liked Alan Greenspan! And, most importantly, (7) although Lewis never says so directly or takes a partisan political stance, it is clear to me from his book that our two major political parties only say different things but do the same thing. As Lewis puts it: \\"Free money (i.e.; no risk) for capitalists, free markets (i.e.; risk)for everyone else.\\"<br /><br />This isn't just a good book. It's a great book; a must read.
B0078X2LKY|2.0|I was disappointed that this appears to only be the book (with words and pictures) rather than an interactive application like  my grandchildren enjoy on their parents' Apple iPhone.<br /><br />I loved reading the book to my children when they were little, and think the book itself is wonderful, but after watching the grandchildren engage with the interactive version on the iPhone, it was a letdown to only have a book, and to pay what seemed like full price for a book.

B001FES0IE|5.0|A night at the opera is arguably Queen's best album in its entire course of history. Every song has its signature remark as I had never perceived so in other Queen's albums. With its world hit: Bohemian Rhapsody is propagating into the ears of millions of audience in the 70s and 80s that can still be felt today.
B0059XTUVI|1.0|Can I give a review with zero stars?  This movie was extremely disappointing.  Consider all that Margaret Thatcher accomplished, the change she brought to the UK (good or bad) and you have a compelling biography.  Now focus on her late life dementia.  This movie played as a political hack job instead of an intriguing biography.
B006JSXYPA|5.0|Transformers: dark of the moon arguably has the best action compare with its predecessors. However, it does have the worst story compare with the previous two movies.

B005LAIHPE|1.0|It's bad.  But if you liked Skyline and Battle Los Angelos, also lousy movies, then you'll like this one.  So, what will you find in this movie?<br /><br />A pretty good beginning, but after that, it went downhill fast.  It's a cookie cutter alien flick, complete with absolutely ridiculous, leap frogging marine craft.  That's right, they came from zillions of light years away, but have no idea how to build a boat, so they hop like frogs.  And of course, today's audiences don't much care for beam weapons because they don't explode in big fireballs, so these 'advanced aliens' are using armor penetrating, explosive projectiles which tumble in the air and just happen to always land point first.  /sigh/<br /><br />The entire movie basically centers around the 'bad brother' being forced to \\"grow up\\" by taking command in the alien invasion, where his boat is cut off from the the rest of the fleet by a force field.<br /><br />All of the cliches and nuances of bad sci-fi/alien films are here, including aliens who are constantly switching weapons for no reason.<br /><br />The actors are cardboard (except Neeson), dialogue reused from the last 50 B movies, special effects are not special at all, ending is predictable, etc, etc.  I think you've got the idea.<br /><br />If you just like 'cool stuff' and lots of shooting, then this is for you.
B0086700CM|5.0|This is the most exciting and exhilarating game I have played in a long time! I never tire of playing this game. It will definately make your heart race as you start running from the wild primates while you try to turn,  jump,  duck and collect coins on your way to the goal. The game has awesome sound effects and great graffics. I would highly recommend. this to young and old alike!!
B002ONC9NM|4.0|Based on an article in Granta by British journalist Lynn Barber, An Education is a tremendously well acted film about a precocious sixteen year old who is seduced by a dashing thirty something who takes her on whirlwind romance only for her to discover that he is a married con man.  Carey Mulligan stars as Jenny the young girl in what was a star making turn.  She is absolutely charming and winning in the role and she received a well deserved Best Actress Oscar nomination.  Peter Sarsgaard is David the con man and he gives a smooth, icy performance that was definitely worthy of a nomination despite one not being received.  The film is set in England in the early 1960's and the plot seems completely unplausible except for the fact that is based on Ms. Barber's actual experiences from the time. The film was nominated for Best Picture and Nick Hornby's sharp script picked up a Best Adapted Screenplay nod.
B006Y9DY8Q|5.0|See this film period! As far as Anime goes, this is the gold standard in production quality, artistry, and plain punch. There hasn't been an Anime title in many many years to compare to this (some great old titles do come to mind...Akira, Ghost in the Shell, etc..). However, this film is the scrawny little scrapper among brainy cinema giants who never gives up!!! Redline is what seeing your first Anime should be like,....a straight forward but well developed story line, absolutely beautiful and detailed animation, and a massive dose of adrenaline!!!! Get off your behind and watch it!!!! Redline, I've missed you!!!!!!!
0385737955|5.0|I went into this book knowing nothing. At all. Very much like Thomas, the main character, and so I was on the edge of my seat through this whole entire crazy, thrilling, and terrifying book!<br /><br />I think the thing that deserves the highest praising is the world-building. You're thrown into a completely unfamiliar environment, and slowly learn how things work. Seeing how the Glade has developed, and how they function as a society is really interesting. And the idea that anyone in the world would decide to set children into such a horrible situation is probably the most terrifying thing.<br /><br />The characters were all fascinating. Those which we were introduced to had very distinct personalities. I think my favorite characters were Chuck and Teresa. Chuck might not have been the smartest of the bunch, but he was kind and forgiving and loyal and I loved that about him. And then there's Teresa. Even though she's kind of in a coma for most of the book, I liked her attitude and personality and seeing how she interacted with Thomas.<br /><br />The writing was different from what I usually read (I'm used to a female narrator I guess), but it certainly wasn't bad. I wasn't a big fan of the swear words they'd developed in the Glade. It was really excessive (although, what should I expect from a bunch of boys?) and drove me crazy!!!<br /><br />And one thing that bugged me throughout the whole book was this: It's made well-known early on that they get one boy once a month, and that they've been there for two years. Well, that would equal 24 boys, right? Except I'm pretty sure at least a dozen people died before Thomas ever showed up. So now we're down to twelve. But there are definitely more than twelve guys around. And then near the end it's mentioned that there are well-over 40 boys there. Now, where did that number come from? This is never cleared up, and was nagging me the whole time.<br /><br />So, all in all this book was really good, with just a couple minor problems. And, most importantly, it left me begging for the next one (which I promptly, at 1AM, requested from the library)!oblems.

0525953728|1.0|What a disgrace that someone who signs a confidentialy agreement, then writes a book with state secrets, is allowed to peddle his wares on Amazon and profit at the expense of our national security. Shame on all of you who buy this garbage and shame on Amazon for carrying it.
B007SGM084|1.0|After hearing everyone else talk about the series, I thought I would enjoy it too so I bought all three at once. It was only a little cheaper bundling them, so next time I will only buy one at a time. I read the first few chapters of the first book, and was very disappointed. So books two and three were money wasted.
030758836X|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. A must read. I could not stop reading.Writing is brillant.  It took you on so many different paths each unexpected. I did not want the book to end,but I could not wait to see how it did.  Ending did not disappoint. I did not see that coming either.  Amazing wife or psych bitch.  You be the judge.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|very entertaining would reccomend to anyone. keeps u wanting to do more. I play none stop as much as I can.
0071762345|4.0|I picked this up because I was attracted to the concept of making social media more relevant, authentic, and helpful to customers. I was impressed with the author's in-depth knowledge, practical and plentiful examples, and highly readable style. There's a great overview in the appendix of the major social networks and what each of them is best for. This book is also useful for understanding how the use of social media affects the sales cycle. I recommend this book for anyone who wants to understand how to market more effectively using various social networks and tools, or anyone looking for an approachable introduction to the commercial use of social media.
B008VBYN80|5.0|Sure do love this game.  Wish I was able to get add-ons with Kindle.  I play a couple of Gameloft games and the also have ad-ons but not for Kindle Fire.
B0064NTZJO|5.0|...but I loved it. I can see why people who were expecting an action movie were disappointed. It hit all the right notes with me, though. I loved the way L.A. is shot, like a minimal neon dreamscape. The pulsing pseudo-80s soundtrack is also great. Ryan Gosling gives an excellent, low-key performance and the supporting cast (especially Albert Brooks) is terrific.<br />  It's a lot different from the book on which it's based. The Driver gets hardly any back-story like he does in the novel, and it seems like 80% of the dialogue was cut out. Also, the \\"love story\\" barely gets 10 pages in the book, whereas in the film it's pretty much the main focus. Still, the director had his own take on the story and a specific way of telling it and the film is so so well done that it succeeds on its own terms. I have the blu-ray and I've watched it many times. It'll probably turn into an all-time favorite of mine.
B0010YSD7M|2.0|At some point, though always fuzzy, there needs to be a reasonable respect for physics and the rules laid down in the past- as well as common sense.  From Adria's zeroth hour revival (being twice completely vulnerable), 50 caliber machine guns relentlessly pounding away within our hero's spaceship without inflicting more devastating damage to the ship from within than the threat from without, Teal'c taking two staff blasts, defeating a host of jafa, pummeled relentlessly by his arch enemy and suddenly finding the strength to achieve a super human victory, Sam and Daniel solving impossible technical problems instantaneously and repeatedly when all hangs in the balance....it all defies this rule.  It always bothered me that they never addressed the infrastructure needed to maintain and build the technologies they were using.  In Arc of Truth, the plot descends into a pathetic string of melodrama that pained me to watch.  The last two seasons followed this recipe, sadly.  If they took the time to tell the story and let each encounter be solved in a 'reasonable' way through hard-won, incremental and reasonable experiences and adventures it would pass the test. But, sadly, the Arc of Truth left me with an A__ in Pain.<br /><br />I can't help but retain my appreciation for the first 8 seasons and the wonderful characters and adventures to which I was treated.  I was happy to hang out with Teal'c and Daniel again and SG-1 will forever be one of my favorites.  I guess the team producing this just got tired of it.  In retrospect, the show should have been stopped at season 8.
B004LWZWBU|4.0|This was a great film due to the actors, and the great photography.  You do not have to enjoy bird watching or know anything about birds and the movie is not just about birds, but about people.  Good delivery time.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|i first started reading this book about 2 years ago. back when the first one had only just come out. as soon as i read the first book i was hooked. i fell in love with the characters and plot and i couldnt wait for catching fire. dont wait, read this series! you wont be sorry!
B0064Y5U24|1.0|I like Nickelback. I have Silver Side Up, The Long Road, All the Right Reasons and Dark Horse. I wasn't too crazy about how Dark Horse turned out to be. It was ok. Here and Now? Fail. Got it on sale and after listening to it, I regretted the purchase. Nothing really stands out. Sounds like the same song over and over. People seem to forget this is the same band that made \\"How You Remind Me\\". Some of the new songs are loud just for the sake of being loud. While I like catchy, fun tunes, this album is not even good enough to be a guilty pleasure.
B007EC27QM|5.0|I would recommend this to everyone. it has helped a lot with high school math.  I also you it for about most everything.
B007JCP8FE|4.0|This album is great. It has excellent loud, rock songs and great slow songs. While I wasn't particularly fond of \\"Bully\\", I got the album on sale and what a great catch! Worth full price. Most songs are way better than \\"Bully\\". My favorites are: For My Sake, Amaryllis, I'm Not Alright and I'll Follow You.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Definitely an adult book but very good. Will be reading the entire series in the next few months. This was recommended to me by a friend - again, strictly adult.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|If you are in the mood for a fun sci-fi fantasy adventure, then look no farther.  JOHN CARTER is your movie.  This movie sucked me right in and put me in a world that I didn't just want to be in but fight for.  While it was in theatrical release, I saw it nine times.  That's NINE times.  I hadn't seen a film that many times in a cinema since the original STAR WARS debuted.  As other reviews point out, you may have seen some of the elements of John Carter in Star Wars, Avatar, Superman or  Flash Gordon, but that's because all these properties \\"borrowed\\" extensively from the John Carter novels published 100 years ago.  Some critics berated the film for showing these elements anyway, a line in the sand arbitrarily drawn by them just for this movie.  Like the original Star Wars movie and the Indiana Jones films, John Carter has a Saturday matinee appeal to it and the 19th-century setting adds a certain time-lost charm to it.  And the plot is refreshingly deeper than you might expect from a movie of this sort.  If you have kids, they will absolutely love Woola and you probably will to.  The two lead actors, Taylor Kitsch and Lynn Collins, are virtual unknowns but I believe that works in the story's favor as you're figuring out their characters.  In any case, they're both likeable and athletic enough and Ms. Collins does an admirable job of turning what could easily be merely a 2-D pinup and turning her into a flesh-and-blood person.  Willem Dafoe, Samantha Morton, Mark Strong, James Purefoy, Ciaran Hinds and the rest of the cast all turn in enjoyable performances.  Bryan Cranston from \\"Breaking Bad\\" even has a small role in the movie.  The only relevant complaint I heard about this movie was after one of the showings was from two kids complaining it ran a little long (it's 2 hours, 12 minutes), an observation that applies to the Pirates of the Caribbean films as well.  That said, the first few viewings that I saw had people in the audience clapping at the end, myself included.<br /><br />Now the other reality.  While John Carter did well overseas (it set records in Russia), it did not do great business here at home.  This is not the fault of the film.  Disney did a very poor job of marketing it.  You have to soften the ground a bit when you bring back a 100-year-old franchise that the mainstream public no longer remembers.  You have to re-introduce it, give them the history, remind them why the property is important and ground-breaking.  But no, Disney Studios treated John Carter like it was just another action film.  Disney did not show respect to the property and the American public followed their lead.  At the same time, a decision seems to have been made by the Hollywood media to take Disney to task for funding expensive tentpole movies like Pirates of the Caribbean, John Carter, etc. (which prevents small productions from getting made) so the fix was in to bury John Carter before it even debuted.<br /><br />But you probably don't need to know all that.  All you need to know is this: If swashbuckling adventure with a strong, brave hero and a devastatingly beautiful, kick-ass princess both fighting for a worthy cause is your thing,  JOHN CARTER is definitely your movie.  This movie is at least worth a rental but I HIGHLY recommend you purchase it.  Because if you're like me, you're going to want to own it.<br /><br />A possible sequel is still in doubt and could use your help.  If you're like me, you're going to want to go back to Barsoom.  There's a petition available online.  Just do a search for john carter sequel petition after you see the movie.  Kaor!
B008XG1X18|3.0|I have a kindle fire and don't see a search option or category page. I need to go through my boards and go through my pins and others to get anywhere but no options to search! very frustrating but I am at least thrilled that there is a kindle app.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|After reading all of the stephanie meyer's books, I was disappointed in the women reading them and their adoration for Edward because of his controlling/abusive behavior. Now I read the newest sensation in literature and it is even more of the same!  Why is everyone so excited by abusive porn?
B008G33PMI|1.0|I was really looking forward to this, as I love Tarja, and was hoping to get some of her great Nightwish music but without the male vocal parts which I've never cared for.  I own every other piece of music (that I am aware of) that Tarja or Nightwish (with Tarja) ever recorded.<br /><br />Unfortunately, whoever mastered \\"Act 1\\" is apparently stone deaf (or was trying to turn Tarja into grunge).  The base is so overpowering that much of the other music is lost unless you apply massive equalization, which helps, but can't fix the huge amount of distortion since either the audio was overdriven when it was recorded, or the mastering levels were done so high that the equipment itself was clipping and distorting.  Not only is the base terrible because of this, but in the powerful sections of the music, everything, including Tarja's voice suffers from terrible clipping and distortion.<br /><br />I'm not even going to bother ripping these CD's, instead I'll be asking for a refund, as for anyone who really likes music with any clarity at all, both CD's are just terribly painful to listen to.
B000KKPN5C|5.0|I really like this little flash. I bought it for my Nikon D40. It is small and comes with a padded pouch.  It slides off or on quickly and locks in place. I like that the flash is adjustable and can tilt in four steps - Horizontal, 60 degrees, 75 degrees, & 90 degrees. This is a great little flash at a good price.
B008476HBM|5.0|It's just one of the best book I've ever read! Love it! And the movies are great too. Strongly recommended to read.
B005LAIHPE|3.0|This is just another typical action pack sci-fi  movie. Very predictable and for the most part just held my attention to the end.  I don't understand why there always has to be some sort of love interest in these movies where the time could have been used to help improve the story or just add to the movie maybe making the aliens more of force to reckoned with.  Just okay and only worthy of a rental.
B003K1EYM6|1.0|RIP-OFF! The Camera Connection Kit I received was not an Apple Product. The box looks almost identical but is missing the Apple logo. There were no instruction booklets included. Neither connector worked, but the ones from the Apple store that I replaced them with functioned perfect. Apple's price is even less. I would not trust this seller in the future. Item being returned for refund.
B00007GZQZ|5.0|A must see classic. Tom Hanks at his best. His laugh when the tub falls through the floor is up there with Daniel Stern's scream in Home Alone. Brilliant.
B00124DSR0|5.0|I first heard Chicago (or CTA as they were then known informally) right after the release of this record.  The guitar is more predominate than in later recordings and I think this works very well. With the exception of one track this is basically there live stage show and the recording and playing are hot and have a very live feel.  Of course after 40 years SOME of the tracks would benefit from a little tightening up.  I combine this CD with the track \\"25 Or 6 To 4\\" written just after this recording was cut for a very nice playlist.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love being able to look at pinterest on my fire! the browser makes it difficult to repin so the app helps tremendously!
B00138KHAQ|5.0|This is a very nice period recording of the San Francisco rock take on Chicago blues.  Steve Stills appears on several great cuts.  As an added bonus three of the tracks appear twice once as released with ADDED horns and once as originally recorded live with out them. Recommended.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I've tried lots of alternative keyboards and have to say this is the best. There's certainly room for improvement but SwiftKey is so much better than the other keyboards that I would still give it five stars.
B003JSSPSY|5.0|I really enjoyed this dvd i had not seen it as it aired on tv sorry i missed it i would of recorded it every week. I love the story line of the wizards and the seeker i have watched it over and over. i would recommend this to anyone who lives fantasy and magic and soccery, played by some great actors this is a must see.

B0000C0F8W|4.0|I loved this album but the gatefold inside seems to ripple a little bit. also I don't know if it is from overplaying or just something wrong but the re's scratches in the grooves so a song or two skips.
B008TRUDAS|4.0|I have to admit, I was iffy going into this book; I wasn't sure if it would be for me. But after hearing such great things about it and other bloggers recommending it, I decided to give it a shot!<br /><br />Unfortunately, this book has some serious insta-love. I really wanted to love the romance because it's full of so much emotion, but I had a hard time really feeling it when Layken and Will only knew each other for three days and were already \\"in love.\\" They had one date and then when they couldn't be together anymore, they were completely despaired and it was like the whole world fell apart. They spent months \\"getting over each other\\" when there was nothing really there to begin with (no relationship). I wished I could believe it and relate to it, but it just didn't happen.<br /><br />Sometimes I quite liked Layken as a character, but other times she really annoyed me. But in Colleen Hoover's defense, Layken's annoying actions were probably extremely realistic. She very accurately (almost too accurately) goes through the five stages of grief and loss. So when something bad happens, she denies it. She goes things to busy herself to escape reality--to the point where if someone brings it up, she just changes the subject. She gets PISSED. Like, seriously pissed. She treats her mother horribly and given the circumstances (which I won't spoil!), it's really, really saddening. Layken acted like a really immature teenager.. but I guess teenagers do act like that. So I'm struggling between being annoyed because Layken annoyed me, and applauding Colleen Hoover for writing about what happens when a teenager isn't able to deal with something big and bad.<br /><br />But problems aside, this book had me cracking up! The dialogue is hilarious without trying to be, and felt so real and natural. Slammed has some of the best side characters I've ever seen in a book. I think Eddie might be one of my all time favourite characters. She kind of forced her way into Layken's life, stealing her cell phone and putting in her number, and basically saying \\"We're friends now, okay?\\" LOL! She was so strong, funny, sweet, and dependable.<br /><br />The end of this book..did crazy things to me. It's like everything I was feeling in the world suddenly came out. It was 3:30am (I stayed up late to finish the book) and the last page broke me. I started bawling my eyes out and nothing could stop me. I cried, and cried, and cried. Then I texted my boyfriend, desperate for some kind of loving communication. And I clutched my phone, waiting for him to reply, and cried, and cried, and cried. Finally I must have drifted off to sleep.<br /><br />Even though I wasn't completely feeling the romance in Slammed, this book still affected me. I think once I accepted that I wasn't going to love the romance, I found other things about the book to love (like the side characters). And good God, this book is heartbreaking. It's like everything bad that could possibly happen, happens. But some good things happen too!<br /><br />Slammed is an emotional roller coaster of a book. It's about more than just romance, and instead it deals with life. This book is about the good, the bad, the hard, first love, family, school, friends, loss, grief, and hope. I'll definitely be reading the second book!aling her cell phone and putting in her number, and basically saying \\"We're friends now, okay?\\" LOL!

B008JMKN4Y|1.0|First off, there is no book where I sympathize for a character that treats women like rag dolls. Travis is a controlling son of a bitch and I was in no way waiting for him to change his tune. My last straw was when he asked Abby to live with him, starts to express his interest in her, then throws a temper tantrum and brings home two women to have sex with right in front of her. Sure, they were still considered \\"just friends\\" at the time, but what woman would feel comfortable with that situation? Not me.<br /><br />Check the rest of my review for Jamie McGuire's new book, Beautiful Disaster, on my romance book review blog, Reading Until I Fall Asleep: [...]

0345803485|3.0|Before Fifty Shades of Grey, the only experience with the BDSM genre I had was Vishous' book in the Black Dagger Brotherhood series, Lover Unbound, by J.R. Ward. (And I suppose if you count the cult classic movie, Manos: Hands of Fate, which I in fact do) While it's a pretty epic book (my favorite in the series), I was not completely prepared for what was in store for me from Mr. Grey. I had my expectation, and this book certainly exceeded them. But as much as there were some hot, steamy moments, there were a lot of things that left me cold.<br /><br />Check out the rest of My review for this novel, posted on my Romance Novel Review Blog, Reading Until I Fall Asleep.

B006XF5BTG|5.0|After feeling that my physical fitness was deteriorating and I started some doing more Cardio I was not content with my results. So I started looking for some good advice how to improve my health and my looks. I was doubting my own common sense approach and the book certainly gave good practical advice, but it also gave it in a logical step-by-step way by creating a foundation of concepts and building on them. I have read very little on the subject, but I am convinced that the advice given in the book gives results.

0307951529|5.0|I usually do not read books on business because by the time an idea ends up in print, there is a good possibility the idea has started to decline in worth.  I did find this easy-to-read book valuable in a few ways:<br /><br />1. It inspired me to read about the featured businesses, not because they made money, but because they followed their passion.  There aren't enough of those types of examples out there.<br />2. I found small business resources for services I would pay for anyway, I'm happy to support many of the business listed in the book.<br />3. It has helped me explain to my students the importance of having a process, BUT not allowing your processes to get in the way of your goal. The short forms, emphasizing getting straight to the point are valuable.<br />4. Finally, the book serves as an indicator, that the world economy is changing and employment and work/life balance matters to the the best and brightest young people who will soon lead industry.<br /><br />Overall the information in the book is timely,  informative, motivational and a great tool for the creative person who knows they want to strike out on their own, but needs a place to start.

1439102732|1.0|I've worked at a public library for the past year and saw a lot of Jodi Picoult's books pass over the check-out desk.  \\"Hmmm, must be an author worth reading,\\" I thought.  So, Sing You Home is my first book read by this author.  It will also be my last.<br /><br />The reason for authoring this book seems to be to portray evangelical Christians in the worst light possible while exalting the bliss and virtues of a lesbian relationship.  As I read the book, I wondered how I could have been lured into reading such trash, thinking I surely must have missed some clue on the jacket's review.  I re-read the jacket's description of the plot; there is no indication this book would take this bent.<br /><br />It is a fairy-tale.  No pun intended.
B008KWHM6U|5.0|Some of the early criticisms  say this album is more predictable, \\"boring\\", or formulaic than their previous.  In a way, that's definitely true.  If Tourist History was their college album, this is their \\"first job\\" album.  This band is growing up.  It's like they did a bunch of juvenile rocking out and experimentation on TH (that is not a negative; I love TH), settled on a flavor they liked most, and went in that direction.<br /><br />Beacon is eminently enjoyable, solidly upbeat throughout, maybe a bit airier than their last (especially towards the end of the album).  It is also more musical; there is greater emphasis on musicianship / instruments, and the vocals are somehow less prominent, complimenting and meshing with the music rather than stealing the show as the centerpiece.<br /><br />For my part, I loved every song on this album on the first play, and it just keeps getting better.  If Tourist History was an album that really resonated with you through its kidlike enthusiasm, it might be worth listening to the samples here and weighing your purchase.  But if you felt like TH was a glimpse at a band with exciting potential as they matured, grab this straightaway.

030758836X|3.0|i was getting pretty excited about this book.  It had some good twists and turns throughout the first half and then, the twists and turns were too hard to keep up with.  I was really, really excited to see what Nick had planned at the end to get some vindication.  When I got to the end, I just scratched my head.  Really??  I spent all of these hours for this?  I loved the book, hated the ending.

I have streamed movies from Amazon before with no issue, but apparently Amazon has recently decided to cut MAC and Linux users out of using their videos and blaming it on a flash update.  Clearly, my flash player is not the problem, since I have the most current version of Adobe Flash PLayer.

1597801585|2.0|I got this book after seeing positive reviews and seeing it was nominated for the Hugo/Nebula.  I read a lot of sci-fi and fantasy and I think this book fell squarely in a very common trap for these genres.<br /><br />In a nutshell this is an excellent exercise in world building that is deficient in every other respect.<br /><br />I could not get into any of the characters in this book - the author would assign a single trait to each one of the narrative centering characters and then fail to develop them at all. They were so one dimensional, often it was hard to tell why some of the narratives existed, except to show off the world building. The title character, was really the worst. She had no personality and her one motivation - to escape to a possibly mythic community of others like her - was to flimsy to sustain any interest. Not one character ever actually appeared to care about any other or about what was happening outside of the one assigned trait or goal. Each just moved through the landscape with marginal interaction.<br /><br />Ostensibly there was a story about politics but you never could keep the sides straight or understand what was happening except people were fighting and things were going to hell. Even as these events occurred I kept waiting to care about any of it but I never was able to because none of the characters were emotionally responsive or changed in any way. The story telling was incredibly wooden and awkward.<br /><br />I found the politics of the author (the agri-busneses as huge villains) to be a bit simplistic and heavy handed as well. Yes, Monsanto et al have jerky, very unethical, business practices that take advantage of the poor, but they're far from civilization destroying. Overall I can't believe this book won awards!  But on the other hand, I think there is a history in Sci-Fi of ignoring bad writing if the world building is interesting, so maybe it's not that surprising after all.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|I'm hooked on this game! I didn't care for it on my iPhone as it is really too small to see; however on the KindleFire it is great! Hardest part is that the icons (tiles) are large on some puzzles then small on others. Great game and works well former!
B002FOQXZK|5.0|I first found out about Kid Cudi when I heard the song \\"Day N Nite\\" and after that I was hooked.  I went searching for albums and mixtapes and have yet to be disappointed, this guy is talented.  I downloaded this album when it was released in 2009 and still have not tired of it.  His music is unique, he makes rap/hip-hop music but he also succesfully blends electronica and spacey beats in here.  It's not the run of the mill rap that you hear everyday.  His music is great to just relax too.  This has easily become one of my favorite albums of the decade and it has one of my favorite songs of the decade, \\"Pursuit of Happiness.\\"  Unfortunately, artists like him don't get as much attention as they truly deserve and are usually sidelined for the more mainstream acts like Drake, etc.  Every song is amazing on this album but the best songs in my opinion are \\"Day N Nite,\\" \\"Pursuit of Happiness,\\" \\"Cudi Zone,\\" \\"Sky Might Fall,\\" \\"Soundtrack 2 My Life,\\" \\"Up Up & Away,\\" \\"Enter Galactic,\\" and \\"Alive (Nightmare).\\"  The replay value of this album is extremely high and I highly recommend it to anyone who likes rap/hip-hop but is looking for something unique and interesting.  Check out his other albums and his rock project WZRD as well, it make take a few listens to appreciate the rock album but you won't be disappointed.

0307951529|5.0|This book as with books like the Four Hour Work Week create a new paradigm in thinkig about how business could be started. After decades of thinkig in a particular way it is refreshing and helpful to have a book showing alternative ways to approach the starting/building of a business. We all become creatures of habit over time and this book serves as a way to break through the old, stale ways that I and many others have succombed to over the years. I highly encourage anyone interested in starting a business to read this first.

0374214913|3.0|I liked this book because it was different. It piqued my curiosity.<br /><br />Penumbra brought to mind Harry Potter's Professor Dumbledore - the older bookstore owner is magnetic, intelligent, a kind of hero who doesn't back down from bullies yet who needs assistants to help him hunt down answers to a variety of quests.<br /><br />Clay Jannon, the newest clerk at Penumbra's bookstore, is also a likable narrator - he is extraordinary at finding the resources needed to get jobs done and find not only answers, but things that reveal answers. His close group of friends who help him throughout the book are talented, quirky and interesting. I like them all, though found it hard to relate to some of them at times because they're all exceedingly smart (and I am quite ordinary). Sometimes I felt like the detailing of the processes (new technology, Google goals and direction toward those goals, even the book cult and their single-minded mission to find the key to immortality) bogged down the story and took away from the personal connections I sought with the characters.<br /><br />There are two things that stood out as highlights for me - things I liked best. One was how Clay used both a mysterious source called Grumble, and his favorite books and the author who wrote them for clues and help. The second thing is the ending. Although I stumbled through the code-breaking and war within a book cult I found not very appealing as well as not something as a book lover I would want to be a part of, I could relate to and did enjoy the way Clay made his final presentation and summed everything up. The conclusion was satisfying and complete.

0307956350|4.0|Kate Moore is an ex-CIA agent now living in Luxembourg with her husband, Dexter and their young children. Dexter's job is to ensure the security of banks. She doesn't really know much more than that. When a couple, Bill and Julia befriend them, Kate gets increasingly suspicious that they are not who they claim to be. She soon discovers that she is surrounded by deceit and deception.<br /> THE EXPATS is a clever debut novel by a book editor. Chris Pavone should know better. His book meanders along at a maddeningly lethargic pace. Characters are well conceived and realistic enough for this type of suspense novel. The problem occurs at the end when it takes over a dozen pages to explain all the intricacies of the over complex plot. Thankfully, no gun wielded by a villain as all was being told. This is an entertaining book and a slid first novel.

1451627297|5.0|This was an absolutely wonderful read in so many ways. Time travel, love story, horrifying at times and of course; stopping the Kennedy assassination.<br />This novel is brilliant in capturing the feeling of living in the late fifty's and early sixties.<br />George Amberson finds a time slip in the back of an old diner that sends him to 1958. His mission: To prevent the assassination of John F Kennedy, and take out Lee Harvey Oswald. But George learns quickly that the past is fighting against him.<br />The premise of his plan, was that by Kennedy living, this would avoid Vietnam, thus saving thousands. But what really changes is mind-blowing.<br /><br />A valiant novel. King continues to outdo himself and his fans.

0374203032|2.0|I will not comment on his philosophy in the area of Politics and Justice, but the area of economics must be a complete mystery to the good professor and deserves a response.<br />Below are a few quotations from  Sandel's book.  They are a small sample, but a good indication of his embrace of virulent progressivism as a philosophy regarding the political economy.<br /><br />Page 7  \\"...It was the expansion of markets, and market values, into spheres of life where they don't belong.\\"<br /><br />Page 10  \\"These examples illustrate a broader point:  some of the good things in life are corrupted or degraded if turned into commodities.  So to decide where the market belongs, and where it should be kept at a distance, we have to decide how to value the goods in question - health, education, family life, nature, art, civic duties, and so on.  These are moral and political questions, not economic ones.  To resolve them, we have to debate, case by case, the moral meaning of these goods and the proper way of valuing them.\\"<br /><br />Page 11  \\"The great missing debate in contemporary politics is about the role and reach of markets.  Do we want a market economy, or a market society?  What role should markets play in public life and personal relations?  How can we decide which goods should be bought and sold, and which should be governed by nonmarket values?  Where should money's writ not run?\\"<br /><br />Page 88 has this gem:  \\"The notion that economics is a value-free science independent of moral and political philosophy has always been questionable.  But the vaunting ambition of economics today makes this claim especially difficult to defend.  The more markets extend their reach into noneconomic spheres of life, the more entangled they become with moral questions.\\"<br /><br />Many such phrases come early as in the introduction, throughout the book, and cast doubt on Sandel's understanding of the market.  He appears not to know that the market economy is simply the total of all trades individuals make with each other.  I am not sure he understands that every value within the law has an economic base.  He apparently feels the market is a living thing that can influence the tides of the political economy, that somehow markets direct human activity and are to be controlled.<br /><br />But the market really consists only of numbers.  Those numbers occur when people freely decide to trade or not trade.  Individuals exchanging goods and services are the market and use a myriad of thought processes of which we know nothing.  Nor do we need to know why people trade or not trade because they will likely change those thought processes in an unknown manner for the next trade or refusal to trade.  The morals or even the justice of the trade is of no interest to the economist.  He only cares that no coerced action has occurred and the price is in evidence.  Economists like to follow trends to predict the future because it is all they have until they are willing to accept a workable theory of money and credit.  Trends only work until the unpredictable actors who make up the market change their minds.  It is true that no economic crash has ever been predicted by a consensus in economists.  They will always miss it because they cannot know the collective individuals thought processes from which the market acts.  They can see the past trends, but are completely ignorant of rapid future changes.  The only things Sandel can control in the market are the people.  He can only do that by resorting to violence or threat of violence, and enlisting the aid of government, which has the monopoly on violence.<br /><br />The tenor of his book leads me to believe Sandel is trying to apply epistemology to economic activity.  These are two different fields.  I know that I am way over my head when I try to relate human thinking to the mechanics of action and vice-versa.<br /><br />Dr. Sandel leaves no doubt he blames our economic problems on the market.  He tells us themarket is faulty.  He is completely wrong, as are most of his far left colleagues who float from Universities to think tanks to government service and back.  They blame the \\"failing market\\" for the results of their own massive interference with the market.  More than enough written economic knowledge and history is available to blow that progressive theses out of the water.  We can look back at about a dozen major economic disruptions since the founding of our country.  Each one, whether it is called Contraction, Panic, Depression, or Recession, has been caused by rapidly expanding the supply of money and credit from thin air.  Lower interest rates from these counterfeiting operations always eventually lead to enough misallocation of capital to lower the demand for the goods people really want below the point at which those loans, with interest, can be repaid.  The market does not fail, but the government does.<br /><br />After a time of large credit expansion, the economy always crashes.  This is happening now.  Over the last several decades, our twelve trillion dollar economy has managed to load itself up with over fifty trillion dollars in non-performing loans - that is, loans made for projects unable to generate enough growth to service that debt.  The money for such vast borrowing never did exist, having been created from nothing.  Our treasury now is foolish enough to attempt relief by dropping interest rates to near zero and then trying to paper over the problem by creating more credit from nothing.  Would you fix a problem by doubling down on the process that caused the problem?  It never works, but somehow Sandel wants to blame the whole thing on that nasty market.<br /><br />Left to its own devices, the market is self-adjusting.  Whenever political interference with the market warps it far enough, those that made the wrong bets must liquidate the losses and someone else takes over their assets.  All the actors in the market then move forward with appropriate exchanges consistent with productivity and the market again gives accurate statistical data in the best manner to facilitate full use of the market prices.  Growth returns.  Dr Sandel and his cohort either do not understand or refuse to acknowledge the fact that the political act of printing money and credit to bail out the those who acted on false market data and lost is, in fact, only adding more damage to the economy on top of the original damage, thus deepening and further delaying the correction.<br /><br />Dr. Sandel uses many examples, including queues, to illustrate his points.  Unfortunately, he applies economics to solve perceived problems outside the realm of economics.  Usually he ends up in the fields of social justice and politics.  For instance, take his analysis of what he calls Lexus Lanes.  These are our familiar HOV (High Occupancy Vehicle) automobile traffic lanes arbitrarily assigning priority to cars containing more than one person.  I do not think he even understands that economic analysis does not apply to the situation.  No market forces were evident in bringing HOV lanes into existence.  It was all done by government decree and a modicum of bribery for the cities who really had no choice in the matter, let alone those individuals who make the market.  These lanes would never have been developed within the market because the cost of the lanes is so high due to additions to present roads and control features that their cost approaches that of a properly designed highway with enough free lanes to handle the traffic.  Dr. Sandel falls into the trap of automatically assigning full political control to situations best left to the market.  Progressives, such as the author firmly believe that government leaders know far more than the masses and that the proper duty of government is to take control of individual's lives - a most unnatural state of affairs, that has the opposite effect of bettering the masses.<br /><br />Throughout the book, Dr.Sandel uses the word, \\"We\\" in reference to deciding how to determine what goods and services must be bought and sold and what goods and services will not be sold.  Obviously he believes government should be the \\"We\\" and since the market, by definition, is only made of interpersonal exchange, then \\"We\\", the actors, must be subjected to coercion, which means the market is no longer free.  Which also means totalitarian political pressure abrogates the market.<br /><br />Of course, markets require some political interference; the most practical amount in the world so far was worked out by our founding fathers as they designed our constitution for minimum market interference, but still retaining a monopoly on violence.  No country in the world has ever come close to matching the United States in terms of productivity and standard of living.  Maximum interference with the market, like North Korea's totalitarianism suppresses the free market to the point it barely functions and people become uniformly poor to the point of starvation.<br /><br />Dr. Sandel apparently does not believe in meaningful market function.  By inference, then, he believes sovereignty should pass from the people into government, which flies in the face of virtually every economic study of many hundreds of countries' political economy.  Where the free market is supreme, the quality of life is good.  Where politics overrides the market, we have to stumble over the wreckage caused by government interventions.  As well written and easy to read as his book is, I believe a critically thinking reader might agree that Michael J. Sandel would have been far more comfortable discussing his political economic philosophy with Karl Marx, Mao Tse-tung, and Fidel Castro than he ever would have been with Thomas Jefferson, Friedrich A. Hayek, and Milton Friedman.

B005CVWWJY|2.0|I stopped reading this book about a third of the way through because it just became unbearable. After a short introduction into of what the future is supposed to have become, the author has us watching his hero use an ancient laptop to enter into a virtual 1980s world where he lives out a Dungeons and Dragons fantasy. That was enough for me. Unless there is a completely unexpected plot twist, this was not a book I'd like to read, and not the book I thought I bought given the description. Maybe teenagers with inexplicable 1980s nostalgia will enjoy it, but I can't imagine that anybody else will.
0066620996|5.0|It has been ten years since I first picked it up Good to Great and, as expected, it is as valuable today as it was then.  If you read it a while back and liked it, perhaps it is time to re-read it with fresh eyes and a decade of experience on your resume.  There's so many fascinating discoveries in this book that anyone will find a few golden nuggets.<br /><br />Jim spoke again this year at the Willow Creek Leadership Summit, framing most of the presentation around the 1911 South Pole explorations by Roald Amundson and his rival, Robert Scott.  Responsibility, leadership performance, and luck were the major themes.  Collin's presentation got me thinking about the book again, and I decided to go back and re-read it.  There's a ton of things I missed or forgot over the years, so I am thrilled to have the new learning.<br /><br />Good to Great is the second in the series by the author, though it's really the starting point to the project (think Star Wars series?).  [[ASIN:0060566108 Built to Last: Successful Habits of Visionary Companies]] logically follows this one, and then concludes with [[ASIN:0977326411 How The Mighty Fall: And Why Some Companies Never Give In]].  Last year he released [[ASIN:0062120999 Great by Choice: Uncertainty, Chaos, and Luck--Why Some Thrive Despite Them All]], which I have heard is excellent, also.<br /><br />Early in the book we get a taste of what's coming: \\"Greatness is not a function of circumstance.  Greatness, it turns out, is largely a matter of conscious choice.\\"  The companies who made the leap made the choice to be great, and, through rigorous research, interviewing, and vetting, Jim and his team figured out how they did it and anyone else can.  This saves us a lifetime of work trying to figure it out - just read the book and apply the learning.  The book is very much a roadmap to success, if you have the courage to follow the path.  Given that only 11 of 1,435 companies made the final cut, it's easy to see that this is not the path of least resistance, nor is it one for people who choose to argue with the findings.  The data speaks for itself: either you choose to use this as a leadership development tool or you choose not to.  Either way, you choose.<br /><br />If you have the desire to be excellent and the will to do the work, along with a healthy dose of humility, this is the book series for you.  Take a year to read all four, earnestly apply them in your life, and by this time next year you will be a vastly different person - for the better.  Remember, Good to Great is not about doing more and burning yourself out, it's about doing what works and stop doing what doesn't.  As the author states on page 208 \\"If it's no harder, the results better, and the process so much more fun - well, why wouldn't you go for greatness?\\"  Well said, Jim.ath of least resistance, nor is it one for people who choose to argue with the findings.

The first puzzles are very easy and might mislead you into thinking that the game is TOO easy.

I know Britney's music is not for everyone and isn't deep, moving, or terribly unique, but I do find it fun to listen to.  There are a couple that still haven't grown on me (particularly \\"Criminal\\" and \\"Trip to Your Heart\\"), but the dance songs are dangerously addicting.  I do wish there had been a bit less synthesizing, etc., but that does seem to be quite a trend in dance pop today.  Overall, I enjoy listening to the album when the mood takes me.

I am an avid reader and very rarely put a book down, or stop listening to a audible version, but I have had enough.  This is not only bad writing, but not even enough to keep my interest.  Between the \\"Oh my's\\" and the lengthy over descriptive monotone voice, I just can't take anymore.  I wish I could return it and get my money back.  The last time I felt this disgusted was as a teen reading the Happy Hooker.  Thousands of books later, I am throwing this one back.  Try something different, please!

B007FG9LIE|4.0|This book surprised me with its originality and the cleverness of its basic story idea. Frankly, I'm amazed that no one has told this story before. It's got that ring of both surprise and \\"inevitability\\" that good stories often have.<br /><br />Though Crouch is a good writer, there were a few things about the telling of the story that I didn't love. One was the seemingly excessive focus on the physical torments that the main character endures. There's enough \\"big idea\\" substance to this story that I felt the focus on physical traumas was a bit out of balance. It feels relentless after a while. Crouch also reverts, over and over, to an odd type of sentence structure that doesn't serve him well as a writer. In these awkwardly clause-heavy sentences, which seem to appear on almost every page, much of the action is relegated to passively constructed phrasings that contain an excess of present participles (the \\"-ing' form of a verb). It became distracting once I started noticing it.<br /><br />But I really like this book still. It would make a terrific movie (though with a different title, which would have helped the book as well). I wonder if anyone has optioned it for film development. It's a highly imaginative contemporary horror story, but at the same time disturbingly \\"possible.\\"<br /><br />This is the first Crouch book I've read. I'm sure it won't be the last.

B008K9SG9K|4.0|This is an excellent album.  But the strongest songs on the album are lifted from from prior EPs.  So in some ways this is a bit like a Greatest Hits album with a few new songs thrown in as a bonus.  Also, some of the new songs feature a more prominent synth sound, which isn't my cup of tea.  I much prefer their acoustic-based sound and am a bit disappointed that this album goes in a slightly different direction.  For example, I was hoping that the new album would include studio versions of Darkness and Destination (which have been played in live sets but never released on prior EPs).  I also miss the counterpoint of the female vocalist (and keyboards) that used to be a staple for Imagine Dragons.  What happened to Theresa Flaminio?
0446572993|4.0|I liked this book as it was interesting and a page turner.  However, at the end I felt that the climax was \\"too much\\" as every thing was happening all at once.  (Just my preference...)  Nevertheless, I would read more of David Baldacci's novels.

1451648537|3.0|The legendary life of Steve Jobs. One of the founders of Apple. Not popular as a kid growing up. Always felt abandoned as a child and adult. Got into making computers and fast forward to what we have today, one of the world's largest companies in history. Apple. I am not even half way through this amazing biopic of the man who changed technology, but am loving his compelling story of a man straight out of being a hippie,going through hardships creating his own company, but in the end manages to pull it off beautifully. Sorry when I make my reviews that I have not completed the product, sometimes not even viewing it before I write but I love reviewing products that make me a happy person. Anyways back to the book. Such an amazing, fabulous, and compelling read of what I have devoured so far- A little long roughly around 576 pages but a great one at that. Biographies are made to be that long to indulge the reader into an immerse world of great people who in spite of being told wrong, accomplished great feats over the course of their varying lifetimes. Anybody who wants something to make them stay up late with a lamp turned on over their shoulder than this biography is for you. If you have a biography project in school then read this- Of course of you are under the age of 11 then this book will be very challenging for you. I hope this bio review was helpful to you.Bye.
B008GOAFBQ|5.0|Wow, this sounds better than I thought it would! The remixed/remastered tracks have more low end and high end, with everything in between.<br /><br />  \\"Detroit Rock City\\" The sound reaches out at you! Bass is brought out and some unused sound effects are added. Every crescendo is explosive!<br />  \\"King Of The Nighttime World\\" The twin leads are more apparent and Peter's great drumming sounds better than ever!<br />  \\"God Of Thunder\\" Wow! This will rattle the walls! I love what Bob did with this mix. I have heard many mixes and this one is the best!<br />  \\"Great Expectations\\" A personal favorite, Was always annoyed by the ripple in the tape at the line \\"Million miles away.\\" And it's gone! The choir and  the guitars sound amazing! With Peter's thunder drums. This put a smile on my face!<br />  \\"Flaming Youth\\" OH NO! The much talked about \\"hiccup\\" is definitely annoying! It ruins anything positive about the mix!<br />  \\"Sweet Pain\\" I love the alternate version, not just the lead guitar, it is a cool alternative.<br />  \\"Shout It Out Loud\\" Sounds like it was recorded today! Much fuller sound! The removal of the echo on the final chord is a bit drastic. sound like he just hit the stop button.<br />  \\"Beth\\" Bob  creates a masterpiece! Acoustic Guitars that were not used in previous mixes, are brought up and play through the whole song, not just the final chord! This sound so fresh and a joy to listen to! This track is the holy grail.<br />  \\"Do You Love Me\\" I wasn't expecting much but as soon as those drums started, my jaw dropped! Like \\"Shout It..\\", sound like it was recorded today!<br />  \\"R&R Party (outro)\\" It is what it is.....<br />  \\"Sweet Pain\\" A fresh version of the lead we all know!<br /><br />All in all, for the price, it's worth it for any KISS fan. Yet, I still will keep the original. The disc itself is not silver, it's black! Much like the old PlayStation 1 games. When did this change happen?

B000Z1LOBI|3.0|DEMONIC got some good TESTAMENT songs like JOHN DOE and THE BURNING TIMES...but is BY FAR the TESTAMENT album i care less...After one of their BEST EVER LOW, the band got only Eric Peterson and the GREAT Chuck Billy...and the songs are TOTALLY DEATH/BLACK METAL!!!!! i think it´s rawer and heavier than what PANTERA and SEPULTURA were doing at the same time, at the late 90´s....well, i like most ALL the stuff TESTAMENT recorded, but DEMONIC is the TESTAMENT one i think is not so great....The best ones are THE NEW ORDER, PRACTICE WHAT YOU PREACH, LOW, THE GATHERING and FORMATION OF DAMNATION!!!! TESTAMENT RULES!!!!!!
B000AYEL6U|5.0|Elizabeth Gaskell's strong and emotionally deep characters are treated with dignity in this film. This film had my interest from the beginning, however when Margaret walks into the room with cotton fluff floating through the air and sees Thornton severely overseeing the works. I was caught. The filming is breath taking. The director allows a relationship to develop between the actors and in turn as a member of the audience, I believed. The film feels more real than Pride and Prejudice, perhaps this is due to John Thornton's hard work and determination.  His love for Margaret seems more poignant as nothing comes easily to him. Like Margaret I grew to admire the difficult life and spirit of determination that prevails in the \\"North\\".  Also, like Margaret I fell in love. This breathtakingly passionate film has an ending that took my breath away with its gentle touch. It has left me yearning for more. A lovely film that is easy to recommend to anyone who loves Pride and Prejudice.

B008IJTFYW|5.0|Just selecting the sounds for my meditations cause my heart rate to lower. With the first couple of notes my mind begins a journey to peaceful places...walking a shoreline digging my toes in wet sand, crunching twigs underfoot as I meander thru an ancient forest still moist with morning dew, laying in bed at camp just before falling asleep enjoying cricket songs. How much more pleasant &amp; productive I am after meditation with the aid of this app.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|this app is really nice. there are lots of options, and the sounds dont sound cheap, only soothing. my personal favorite is the river sound.
0345803485|1.0|Ok, so the only possible explanation I have for the success of this book is that millions of women are deprived of both good, erotic sex and good literature. This sexual exploration feels very '80s and very vanilla. Guess James got stuck there when she put her writing on hold. And, speaking of the writing-- it can only be called \\"writing\\" because it uses words strung together in sentences. Where was the editor for this book? The book is a poster child for poor literary quality. Wait, what quality? There is none. Can't even classify this as poor, and certainly not as literary.<br />I agree with some other reviewers about the overuse of cliches and phrases and chewing lips and blushing. And, what 21 year old says \\"Oh my!\\" or \\"I'll fetch it.\\" Once I learned that James was British, that explained somewhat, but then she should have kept the location in Britain, not Seattle.<br /><br />On top of that, the characters are empty and just plain unlikable. If I met Ana, I'd want to spank her just for being such an idiot.<br /><br />I won't bother wasting my money or my time with the other two \\"books.\\" And I'm so disappointed that money will be wasted on a film. Good for James that she'll be making some big bucks, but that's sort of like saying good for \\"Octomom\\" Nadya Suleman, that she can make money dong bad porn.
B006IMY5ZU|4.0|I'm not much of a movie person, so in order to get me to watch one, you have to pretty much nail me down. I am a baseball fan.  I never read the book, but just the same, I'm aware of all that went on with the A's.  Well done movie.  Entertaining and a bit informative.  Worked as filler for a 4 hour train ride I took alone.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|Handy app. Found it useful and insightful (nice to see 'good' on battery's condition). Had no idea how hot my battery got for one thing and is very handy to know how much juice you have left for each type of use (reading, surfing, playing 2D amd 3D games etc.).
B008IJTFYW|5.0|This has got to be the absolute best and relaxing app out there.  It doesn't take me any time at all to just relax.....let alone sleep.
B0063IH60K|4.0|It is a good game. The ads are bothersome but now that I know how to skip them. I enjoy the game.
B007URVZJ6|2.0|Your cover looks great. The content has some tips. But the formatting just didn't work. I had to buy another book to fix it.
0345803485|3.0|I bought the book because everyone was talking about it, how amazing it is, how erotic & such. I genuinely did like the book, I thought the story line was cute in the \\"Will Christian ever love her way?\\" so I will be reading the other two so I can find out.<br /><br />As for the erotica, I honestly expected a lot more. I thought I was going to dampen my panties, the way people were raving about it. I was more into the scene when Christian opens up, than the sex ones. He barely did anything to her in the playroom. Hit her with a riding crop and banged her against the wall and then he 'flogged' her and banged her on the bed. I've read a lot more steamier books.<br /><br />I thought the emails back and forth were very cute.<br /><br />All for all though, the book did make it to #1 New York Times Bestseller so Kudos to the author.
B005KDDUVS|5.0|Read it because it was my sons Spanish assignment.  Excellent story and could not put it down.  Some of the words were \\"catellano\\" so I needed a dictonary to understand the meaning.
B006III9B0|5.0|I have watched gLee from episode 1... So naturally, I wanted the soundtrack to my favorite show. In the show, you don't get to hear entire songs from start to finish, so I was very happy that the songs on the cd are performed in their entirety.
0439023521|5.0|What can I say... I loved it. I loved the narrative, I loved the characters, I loved the love story, I loved it all. I couldn't wait to read the next two and then I was mad b/c I wanted more!
B0015AARJI|1.0|It was a PS3 Copy, the buttons were really rough and did not responded very well on the game. At lesat they return what i paid
0345803485|3.0|If you've never read erotica, this is a good place to start. It's basically a modern Cinderella tale with BDSM. No, it's not that well written but give the lady a break... it started out as fan fiction and exploded to what it is today. The sex scenes were hot and I was always eager for my hubby to return from work after reading :)
B003YFIUW8|5.0|From the mouths of babes, this story flows perfectly from a young boy that has never left \\"room\\". The author's voice through a young boy, is masterful. He speaks directly to the heart of the reader, and you feel like you are in \\"room\\" with him.
B0062OCNAI|5.0|Terrific read, but be warned.  Once you start it you will not put it down.  Difficult to classify it.  It is a good murder mystery, a great love story, and a bit of the paranormal.  It is fast-paced with the suspense building almost from the first page when a school is torched.  The mother Grace, and her teenage daughter Jenny are the victims.  To their chagrin the police close the case without finding the right person.  As the story progresses, Grace learns a great deal she did not know about her family and friends.  It is rare to discover a book with an original and different presentaion such as this.  It reminds me in some ways of \\"Lovely  Bones\\", and it may be the best book I have read since \\"Lovely Bones\\".  I look forward to reading Ms. Lupton's original novel, \\"Sister\\", hoping I will find the same magic.

B002W19I8U|5.0|I loved this movie when I was a kid and now my kids love it.  Classic 80's fantasy movie. The effects are a bit dated but I still find it magical.  Maybe I'm just nostalgic.:)  Great soundtrack too.
0679731369|3.0|Julian Barnes is an English writer who has been shortlisted for the Booker Prize I can't remember how many times (he actually won it, once, with his novel \\"The Sense of an Ending\\").<br /><br />He's a keen Francophile and, apparently, his love of France is a mutual one, with many awards to his name and a title, \\"Commandeur de l'Ordre des Arts et des Letters\\", which I'm sure not many Anglo-Saxons can claim.<br /><br />Barnes wrote several quasi-mainstream novels but, beware, this isn't one. \\"Flaubert's Parrot\\" is in fact a much more complex affair, a literary divertissement testing the boundaries between biography and fiction.<br /><br />On the surface, \\"Flaubert's Parrot\\" is about a retired English doctor obsessed with Gustave Flaubert. This leads him to investigating the mystery surrounding two stuffed parrots, both claiming a role as source of inspiration for one of Flaubert's short stories.<br /><br />Does this little piece of sleuthing eventually lead to an answer? Hardly the point since Barnes is more concerned with non-linear storytelling and subjectivism.<br /><br />Early in the novel you will encounter three different chronologies of Flaubert's life: one is very flattering, the second is starkly negative and the third is made of quotations by the man himself. The life recounted is the same, the resulting story altogether different. Many chapters follow, each either employing a different style or switching narrator.<br /><br />This is a very clever novel and Barnes' talent with words shines throughout its length. Having said this, some of you at this stage might be wondering whether it's an enjoyable one too.<br /><br />I can only answer from personal taste and my reply is, as it often happens, two-fold: \\"yes, but don't expect a page-turner\\".
B002SJIO5E|1.0|This is the WORST movie ever made.  It was soooooo bad that after making the mistake of buying it -thinking it would be like V, or Independence Day-, I ended up ejecting the cd from my dvd, and actually tossing it away to the wastebasket in the middle of the movie.  DO NOT BUY, IT REALLY IS THAT BAD!
B007ZCQJOM|5.0|I can't stop listening to this album. Standout tracks, to me, are Myth, Wild, Lazuli, Irene, Troublemaker - but I usually just listen to the whole album.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|My daughter wanted to read this book because she heard it was a 'hot' romance book. I rented it for my kindle from my local library and read the book. It is far from a romance book. It is a glorified s&m bondage fantasy erotica book. I hate that we have downgraded our reading to promote this trash. New York Times bestseller list really.
0345803485|1.0|Ok, so I'm probably not bringing anything new to the table when it comes to talking about how terrible 50 Shades of Grey is. I read it because I like to keep abreast of what people are talking about and I was truly astonished by how terrible the writing was. I am not exaggerating in any way. The only thing that made the book entertaining was how poorly the book was written, and then when it got to the sex scenes I was done. They actually made the book worse. I simply cannot understand how this terrible, repetitive book with mind-numbing dialogue and unrealistic characters and situations has completely captivated so many people. Is it because everybody likes erotica? Read Anne Rice's Sleeping Beauty trilogy, they're fascinating and entertaining. Is it because people today don't want to have to read anything with any amount of intelligence? Why are they reading at all, then? I cannot believe how much money this woman has been given for poorly-written fan fiction.

B003TSEEDY|5.0|\\"The Perks of Being a Wallflower\\" is simply an amazing book. It is written through the perspective of a ninth grade boy whom the reader soon finds to be psychologically impaired. It's not until the end that you really find out the reason why. The book is basically about growing up through high school and being yourself even if that makes you the quite one. Chbosky writes wonderfully and in good detail. He has a great imagination and I cannot wait to see how the movie turns out. This is a must read. I read it in two days. :-)
B004VMUS9G|4.0|This is a pretty good app.<br />It does take a lot of battery so I recommend charging it at night-or when alarm is needed.<br />Other than that, this is a great app. it is vey customizable and I really love that I can set my alarm to wake me up with one of my songs on my kindle fire. In conclusion this is a great app.

0439023513|2.0|I read the second book in a day and couldn't wait to read the conclusion.  What a disappointment.  There were pages of this third book that I was absolutely bored with.  Things and people I didn't have any interest in hearing about, and the main characters relationships didn't have any depth.  It was like Ms. Collins was tired of the story, and was in a hurry to get to the end. I hope that when they make the movie that the screenwriters do a better job, because this book needeed a lot of fixing.
B007D2XSW0|1.0|It seems to have the features I want, but doesn't seem to save to sd card, has no menu, no save as feature (png or jpg). Can't find a previously edited photo. Not sure if it saves transparency. Back to Canvas.
034580404X|3.0|Don't you hate it when you are sucked into purchasing a controversial best seller and end up questioning what the fuss was about.<br />This book reminds me of the Twlight trilogy. (Notice any similarity in the book covers?) Young brunette, just out of college. Unaware of of her beauty? Virgin? Come on! Best friend always having her back. Meets Handsome,rich, exciting slightly older man who introduces her to a different world of sex.<br />Ana gets her panties all tied in a knot over the older woman who seduces Christian when he was 15 years old.  Well, isn't that what he's doing to her.  If he wasn't a billionaire would she bother?  I like a good erotic story once in a while, but this book did not leave me wanting more.  I think the writer just put a different twist on \\"Twlight\\" for adult audiences.  Oh well, back to my dollar store smutt paperbacks.
B008MEM24S|5.0|Absolutely love Where's My Perry...<br /><br />I bought this for my children; however like all of the other games I purchase I usually play some of the game to ensure that it is age and skill appropriate for my children.<br /><br />I COULD NOT PUT THIS GAME DOWN until I personally finished the available levels and kept pushing the purchase more levels at the end.  Engaging, fun the extras will give you a laugh.<br /><br />This game has kept my children occupied and engaged in many hours of logic problems that are fun.  They will go back and play previous levels for the enjoyment.<br /><br />Worth the buy at 10 times the cost;  I hope Disney produces more levels soon.

B005WUHAX8|2.0|My husband bought 4 (count them, 4) Lifeproof cases (one online and 3 at Best Buy) to a tune of $300+ and I was really disappointed with mine. I wouldn't spend the money on it. I did the water test as indicated and everything was fine. A couple of days later, I went Kayaking in the Keys and slid the iphone inside the case in my life jacket. We jumped in the water to cool off. Once I got back to shore, I noticed my phone wouldn't turn on. I thought the battery was dead. Charged it and nothing. It was water intrusion- one of the claims of this Life Proof case. Turns out, the yellow O-ring or seal inside the case was loose, so water got in. I lost alot of pictures, memories and had to buy a new iphone! SO, $350 later, I recommend you buy something else.  I called Life Proof and asked them to cover at least 1/2 of the cost of my new phone because their product had proven defective. They said no and only sent me a new cover. I have also noticed that if the phone falls with the cover on, the case edges don't close properly any more. SO, BE CAREFUL - don't drop it, don't immerse it in water ... ohhh, wait a minute, THESE ARE some of the things your phone should be protected from!!!!!! I would NOT spend $80 on this case. Buy the Gumdrops case instead. It's military edition and starts at $54.95.
0553801473|4.0|I went into reading DWD with two things in mind: one, how truly annoyed I was with FFC; and two, how many reviews I'd seen and people I'd heard saying that DWD was as bad or only slightly better than FFC.  As I slogged through the description-laden early parts of the book, I took frequent breaks (something I never did with the first three) when I simply got too tired of hearing about Castle Black politics that involved a bunch of characters I didn't know, or frustrated with Maureen politics that involved a bunch of characters I didn't know with tricky to remember names.  Sometimes I would get so pissed with a particularly lengthy meal or wardrobe description that I'd throw down my book and go do something else.  Basically, I felt the same way I did with FFC: he's spending too much time on needless description, and even the plot advancements don't involve storylines or characters I care about.<br /><br />However, about halfway through the book, a funny thing happened: I started to actually CARE about some of these new characters and plotlines.  The goings-on in Dorne and even places like Volantis began to intrigue me, as did the new directions of old characters like Tyrion (although I won't deny that I never much got into Jon's wildling-saving travails).  It took a book and half to happen, but by the end of DWD, GRRM managed to more or less pull off something pretty difficult in a series: he mostly replaced the plotlines he'd developed in the first three books with new ones.  This is hard to do for the same reason it's hard to make a roller-coaster take a right angle turn; you have to slow it down a lot first.  It took me a long time to let go of the momentum that had built up in SOS, but it did finally happen, and by the end of DWD I was really enthralled with the climax, especially all the forces converging on Maureen in a sequence of chapters that reminded me a little of the excellent sequence at the end of COK during the Battle of the Blackwater.  I think those segments of palpable strife and foreboding surrounding one location, all told from many different perspectives, are the best parts of the series, and the fact that this book had one of those segments automatically earns it 4 stars from me.<br /><br />Yes, I will admit that there is too much description in the book, and the whole thing could have been chopped down or sped up a lot and benefitted greatly from it.  But, on the other hand, I'd rather that it move too slow than too fast.  Another one of this series' strongest points is its way of moving the plot forward significantly without the reader even realizing it.  This is all done through character development and, often, tons of description.  The Red Wedding was great, but how much less powerful would it have been without the reader's knowledge of Walder Frey's demeanor, or Stark characters' many little concessions to honor, or Tywin and, later, Roose's prolonged brooding in Harrenhal?  The red wedding was actually strategized and laid out at the Twins, Harrenhal, and Kings Landing over a long period, but the reader never sees that.  And yet what they DO see hits them like a hammer, because all of the little pieces are there that make it totally reasonable, even if it happened suddenly.<br /><br />The reason I bring up the Red Wedding is that I think a lot of the groundwork for later Red Wedding-esque moments was laid in this book.  The pieces may be taking a little longer (OK, too long) to fall into place in this second batch of plots (and I do think that's what you should consider everything after SOS to be), but that is somewhat understandable when one considers the relatively more mammoth scale of everything post-SOS.  I am confident GRRM will bring the series in for a landing.  That line from the last Dany chapter about \\"going backwards to go forwards\\" could be this series' mantra; because GRRM isn't afraid to go backwards plot-wise by leading his characters on circuitous paths through the story, often skirting the main issues, the plot's forward-jumps resonate with more force.

B005Z8V72M|4.0|I really like Ellen. She cracks me up. While many other reviewers disliked this book because of the \\"silly\\" chapters (Ellen meditating, Ellen making funny sounds), I found there to be shards of sharp social commentary throughout the book as well. Overall, Ellen is someone i really admire for her positive attitude and genuine desire to brighten the day of people she doesn't know. And at 3 discs, it was a quick and easy read on audio. While this book likely won't change your life, I recommend it to anyone looking for a light read that makes you laugh, and also looking for some worthwhile ideas worth passing on to others- like positivity, kindness, and being yourself.

145162445X|4.0|A Universe from Nothing by Lawrence Krauss<br /><br />Nothing comes from nothing, nothing ever could, right?  There's no such thing as a free lunch?  Apparently not.  As Krauss explains, not only does the something of stars and dust and planets and galaxy proceed naturally from from the \\"nothing\\" of empty space, but the \\"nothing\\" of empty space (which is actually measurably something, since it can be warped and twisted and imposes laws upon that which exists inside it) proceeds from actual nothingness, according to recent models.  The book builds to this point; the rest of it sets the context both socially and cosmologically, explaining both the importance of producing something from nothing and exactly what space and nothing are, and something of the scientific history that led to these models.  The fact that Dawkins wrote the afterward to the book may indicate the social setting.<br /><br />What's Good: Krauss tackles what should be a very complex subject conversationally.  That's not to say everything made perfect sense on the first read-through, or that I was able to get through every page without my eyes losing focus and floating away, but generally the concepts, the explanations, and the descriptions are all comprehensible; I didn't feel like I was ever reading another language.<br /><br />What's Bad: The book was presented with the tone of absolute truth, and I'm not in a position to judge otherwise.  Sometimes the book backs it up - it discusses how the predictions of quantum mechanics have been tested to an accuracy of billionths. But many cutting edge physics theories are discarded a few years later when better tests are run (Krauss discusses this), and I didn't feel that the hardest science and the speculative science was clearly delineated.<br /><br />The Takeaway: Whether the entire book was \\"hard\\" or \\"speculative\\", Krauss has done one thing, at least - he's demonstrated that something did come from \\"nothing\\", and something -could- have come from true nothingness, and that's worth talking about.othingness, and that's worth talking about.
0307716546|4.0|There is a fire in a school...the unthinkable happens, Grace has a child inside the school.  Panic sets in and so do her motherly instincts.  Grace races inside and the next thing she knows she is waking up in the hospital.  Grace and her daughter watch as their bodies are on hospital beds but they, or rather their spirits are alive and well wandering through the hospital watching the investigation unfold.  Why was their a fire in a school, who is to blame?  Will they survive?  Will they find the truth?  Ultimately, through many twists and turns Grace and her daughter Jenny will find the answers they are seeking.<br /><br />Some of the answers the women seek are easy for the reader to figure out, but the author does a great job of continuing to shift the story just enough to keep other parts of the story in question!

B0084IG7KC|3.0|An interesting story, and since I didn't read the book I had fun trying to predict how the writer would make sure the couple would survive. The Shakespeare moment was fine considering the audience is too young to know Romeo & Juliet. But the whole movie was filmed with a shakey hand-held camera. It was extremely annoying and I almost turned it off after 10 minutes. With a 60\\" screen, it makes viewers uncomfortable if not dizzy. But again, knowing that most kids will watch it on an iPod or iPad, motion sickness shouldn't be a problem. I know they have stabilized hand-held cameras in Hollywood, so I wonder why it was made to look like it was filmed with an iPhone. The violence was totally lost in a blur of the shakey camera. The special features offers a great audio test for 7.1 surround.
034580404X|3.0|Overall, light fun reading. But I recommend to read the 1st and don't bother about the 2nd and 3rd. Unless u wanna ruin the Christian Grey's sexy, untouchable image in your head ;p

B00005JKCH|4.0|This, the first of the theatrical Spidermen movies was a colossal hit for the time period. Almost every actor cast did a wonderful job, save for JK Simmons, and his over the top portrayal of J. Jonah Jameson. Thank goodness he was used only sparingly. Nevertheless, this movie really hit the spot for me. Cliff Robertson was fantastic, as were all of the other supporting characters, save for perhaps Dunst. Yet that was not her fault as she was given little to work with in this movie. All she did was scream. I kid you not; she was in three situations of extreme danger within the space of only a month of movie time! Get real! The festival at Times Square, the attempted gang rape by tough thugs and last but not least the kidnapping by Green Goblin. That was too many times. The second time was contrived and written in just to exhibit Kirsten Dunst's voluptuous figure in a wet T-shirt. That scene should have been edited out.<br /><br />Comparing and contrasting the two films is fairly straightforward. The 2002 Spiderman was sheer comic book action showcasing a superhero recently endowed with his powers fighting a mad scientist bent on destruction whilst saving the damsel in distress. Peter Parker's parents are never alluded to, and while this kept the action centered in/on the story, it left us wondering about his backstory. Without offending the great Martin Sheen, I liked Cliff Robertson's Uncle Ben the best of the two. The same goes with Rosemary Harris as Aunt May. She looks and feels more like \\"Aunt May\\" than Sally Field. Field is 20 years younger than Harris is and thus there is a 10 year difference in their characters' ages (2002/2012). The scenes with him and his Uncle Ben are very dramatic and emotional. I liked them greatly for their depth of emotion.<br /><br />The Amazing Spiderman with Andrew Garfield was a more in-depth movie. The subplot with Peter's parents disappearing gave us food for thought, as did the very end of that movie where The Lizard converses with a mysterious (Osborn?) man. The acting was just as good and I liked the romance between Parker and the cop's daughter more than I did the love triangle that existed with Maguire, Franco and Dunst. I can't understand how friends would let themselves get placed in that position, especially since Franco's character could have had (Attracted) any girl (Better Looking Girls Too) with his Dad's money!<br /><br />In a nutshell, I loved both movies, but the characterizations were the best in the 2002 movie (Save For J. Jonah Jameson). The reason I give Spiderman Four Stars is because of the writer's penchant to place Mary Jane Watson in too many dangerous situations. Come on guys, we are in the 21st century, women don't scream like Fay Wray anymore! To me it was unseemly, not to mention extremely unlikely for a single woman to be walking down dark streets in New York City in this day and age! No way would that happen in any big American city!<br /><br />Despite its few faults, this movie was a technical masterpiece and brought back Spiderman to the masses after decades of waiting since Nicholas Hammond last played Spiderman (He Too Was Pretty Good For His Time Period).<br /><br />A.

0385737955|5.0|I absolutely love this book!! I was sucked in immediately and completely consumed with discovering the secret of the Glade and the maze.  I think the plot was unique and intriguing, and I loved the way the author presented everything as a giant mystery.  There were constant twists and turns in the story, and this kept me guessing until the end.  I love dystopian novels, and this is definitely one of the best ones I've ever read.  I finished this book, and literally ran out to the bookstore right away and bought the next two books in the trilogy.  I would recommend this to anyone!! Well done :)
1583334386|3.0|This reminded me of various ways my mind has accommodated itself to my actions.  The numerous considerations resulting in an act of will or the course of least resistance.<br /><br />It is the kind of thing most folk will probably get out of occasional newspaper articles or NPR stories.  Those very heavily involved with themselves might want this bible around to remind themselves of tricks they will not let themselves get away with.
B005VPRG10|5.0|gave this to my son on his 9th birthday (6 months ago) and he still loves it. can't go wrong with star wars legos!
B0083Z614S|4.0|This is a well written book.  The theme is completely different from other story lines I've read.  I did really enjoy it.
B008JJM88Q|5.0|Cant stop playing this game one second I think maybe I will finish the level on a game called hot donut (also very addicting) but then Im trying to think of another character for him to guess. You should try it!!!!!!!!
B0002BO0US|2.0|After reading all the hype about this album over the years, I decided to finally listen to it, because my favorite music period is the late 60's - early 70's.  In my opinion, it's much ado about nothing.  I got tired of the irritating Beach Boy harmonies and over-production very quickly.  Most of the songs are nothing special.  They aren't in the same league as Traffic, Queen, Yes or Led Zeppelin.  Most of the lyrics are  trite and pretentious - and the singer really isn't very distinctive.  The song writing is far from spectacular.  I've always liked, \\"Tell Her No\\", and \\"She's Not There\\", but I heard nothing on this CD that matched the quality of those two songs.  WHAT am I missing!!!!?!?!  I'm convinced that the reason why this album has a cult following is because the hooks in some of the songs stay with you like ear worms and drive you crazy! I listened to it twice and will recycle it at my local used CD store.
B008MEM24S|5.0|This game is so addictive!  I got the app for my kids but find myself playing it more than they do!
B0087HT36U|2.0|This game is ok it doesn't need a lot of skill to play. Bombs are way too easy to buy for young kids.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|this app is awesome because I can look at how much battery have and it gives me siginals for when my battey is low and need to charge it
B008MEM24S|5.0|I bought this video game for my four year old grandson.  He loves to play it and has learned to get through the variety of skill levels.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I think this book was okay.  Nothing to write home about.  Too expensive to boot!  So those are my thoughts.
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|Ok. So don't get me wrong I LOVE LOVE LOVE this game. But it has a few bugs. The hog magnet and golden hog upgrade keep coming un-equipped after every time I finish playing,  and that's annoying. Also sometimes when I am trying to fly I let go to go down and Barry just keeps on flying. That is REALLY annoying. My game is fully upgraded. I have all vehicle upgrades and all clothes and gadgets. I almost have all accomplishments finished. And when I finished my last mission it wouldn't let me start over so It just said 'no new missions available right now ' :( But I still love this game. It is extremely addicting. If you loved Fruit Ninja, you'll love Jetpack Joyride!
B008XG1X18|3.0|I've been having to open it twice before it works everytime. other than that seems to get the job done
B005ZUR724|5.0|Don't be dissauded by previous reviews complaining about not being able to log in due to updates.. that is how gameloft updates this game. This game is highly addictive, challenging, and so much fun! It is strategic, action packed, includes great graphics, gear, really cool looking characters and beautiful scenery. Totally worth the price. I have been playing for 3 months now and am not even close to having lost interest. Ive even made a few friends. As a married mother of 2 I would say its not just a teenagers game but fun for all. Although it has a lot going on for younger kids I would reccomend for ages 13 up. My 9 yr. old son lost interest after only 9 levels of completion.
B0094K1PW4|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie.  It created such a realistic world and did it with no excuses or failures.  The nostalgia of the scenes, the plot and the acting truly made this movie.  If you have a good audio system, crank it to watch.  There are scenes that just come alive with both visuals and sound (no spoilers... ;)  )<br /><br />The acting was much more than I'd expected from a teenage group of actors. Obviously thier direction was superb, but few would have pulled off what this group did.<br /><br />If I had more than two thumbs, they'd all be up.
B00785P2QC|5.0|I LUV the PC version of this game the sandbox and now I can take it on the road. the best pass time.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|I overheard a woman at my beauty salon talking about it nearly a year ago. After I interjected myself into her conversation, I discovered that we had some similar tastes, so my curiosity piqued. When I told my boyfriend I was interested in checking out the series, he was ecstatic b/c he thought I wouldn't be willing to watch a serial of this genre. Despite the auspicious anticipation and high expectations of it (which usually lead to disappointment, at least for me), I was enamored from the first episode. It's just edgy, sexy, silly and epic enough that you might like it too! Prob too spicy for anyone under 16 though--and even then...
B0054JZC6E|3.0|I like some of the games and some of them I hate. A few of them are super addictive and dome of them are super stupid. Some of them are really challenging. Several people complain about the update. This hasn't happened to me yet but if my progress gets erased I ail be pissed.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I love this battery app it shows the diagram of how I charge it and. it shows the battery percentage which works perfectly for me!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!and there's no lag
B004XJHBCE|5.0|I have to say that this app is the best folder app I have ever used. Lot's of others have touted the features so I will just tell my favorites.<br /><br />1) Uninstall. With Apple, you can touch and hold to uninstall. Android probably won't ever have that. This is the next best thing. Touch and hold within the folder to pop up options on the app. Uninstall, Relabel (Move folders), Share... Did I mention uninstall?<br /><br />2) Auto organize folders in folders. I have a lot of apps and recently they organized within folders, sub-folders that make sense.  Open Games and you see a folder with all your Brain games and puzzles, or your arcade games.<br /><br />3) Favorites. Just touch and hold to make a favorite. Once made, you can switch the folder view to just favorites.<br /><br />Love it!
B004UID2LC|5.0|I LOVE THIS APP.<br />IT IS A GREAT SOURCE OF GETTING VIDEOS, SONGS,<br />AND THOSE KIND OF STUFF.<br />I HAVE SO MANY SONGS DOWNLOADED AND VIDEOS AND MY MOM HAS THE APP TOO.<br />SHE SHOWED ME IT WHEN I GOT MY OWN KINDLE.
B005IQZB14|2.0|Since a member of my book club selected this book, I read it.  However It was disappointing.  The writer's stated purpose was to document a hike on the difficult Pacific Coast Trail as therapy for her troubled life.  It is not very well written...is repetitious and filled with gratuitous details of sex and drug experimenting.  How it landed on best seller list, I do not know.
1594744769|5.0|I love this book. I finished it within two hours, because I couln't put it down. I love the scenery, the children and Miss Peregrine. When I first saw the cover, I just knew this book was something for me. I loved the photos too, it was so speciel and unique. I wanted to read it again, after i finished it and I'm doing that now. The one thing that bothered me, was that it was a bit boring at first when he arrived at the island. But yeah otherwise, it's brilliant.I loved it, and I can't wait for the second book. And i absolutely love Millard, don't know why though. I just like him, he was so funny.
B008KRJWEK|5.0|awsome cool I love it want to _play it all the time so cool fung kill things by runnigin them over with cars
B004UNXUW8|5.0|This is, hands down, one of the most well-written books I ever read.  The author paints a glorious host of images and presents us with intriguing characters.  Only sorry when it ended.  A total word Smithy treat!
B0002VFXFE|5.0|I used Arctic Silver 5 compound paste in few machines I've built so far. I've seen other brands, but prefer to use only this one. It is thick enough not to run when installing cooler and works just great. 3.5g tube would be enough for at least 2-3 CPU's if you apply it correctly.
B008E374PO|3.0|I've been listening to Owl City for quite a while now, in fact, he was the only artist that made me like anything other than Rock or Grunge. I remember listening to All Things Bright and Beautiful and recall thinking, \\"this guy just keeps getting better and better.\\" Now however, I'm kind of bummed with this album. I don't hate it or even dislike it but...it's just not working for me. It just seems like him collaborating with other artists took away some of that originality and spark that made me love Owl City. I'll give him credit for trying something new but, compared to his other work, it's no where near as good. Like many other reviewers said, the tracks all sound too clich&eacute; and the beauty and originality of his previous work is not present. Most of the songs sound like countless other tracks you've already heard on the radio and doesn't stand out at all. I only give it three stars because like I wrote earlier, it was a brave attempt by Adam, but lets just hope that he decides to work on his own for the next album and produce more amazing music like his other albums.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|I bought Cooler Master Hyper 212 Plus CPU cooler in the beginning of 2010 and installed it onto Phenom II 955 BE. It provides amazingly great cooling for the CPU. Yesterday I've built another machine with Phemon II 965 BE (for my kid), so I bought the same cooler for it without a doubt. Easy to install, large but quiet fan, great efficiency. Not sure if it will give the same results in tight and closed case, but if you have a good gaming case and it is wide enough to fit this pretty big cooler, then go for it. You will not regret. Also, I would recommend replacing supplied paste with Arctic Silver 5. (My cases are Cooler Master Centurion 590 and Rosewill Challenger. Cooler fits just right)
0525953728|5.0|I remember first hearing about this book a couple weeks ago and thought, \\"hmm, this could be interesting.\\" As a person who isn't very interested in American history, I thought I'd make an exception and read his book. I always felt like there was more to the Bin Laden raid and although It's perfectly fine that I don't know all the details, (why would I anyways, I'm not in the military or a high ranking politican) I felt like the public should've had more information.<br /><br />I heard over the last couple of days how many people are considering \\"Mark Owen\\" a traitor for writing a book on such a delicate subject. I on the other hand, think this book is superb and praise him for his courage and honesty. The book is fast paced and goes through the different stages of the authors career in the NAVY Seals. He starts off talking about the time he was preparing to be screened to see if he was good enough to join a special group called the \\"Green Team,\\" which is basically like a test group where only the very best will be picked for DEVGRU, the name for Seal Team Six. It was amazing learning about the emotional struggle and the mental battles a Seal has to go through when preparing to jump off a helicopter into hostile territory or jump into shark infested waters, or save a hostage from a bunch of pirates. I started reading this book the day it came out and finished it that same day.<br /><br />I would not consider this book a bad thing or even consider him a traitor, in fact, I think it's an amazing thing that he risked getting into legal trouble just so he could be able to tell his story to those of us who aren't privileged enough to participate in these highly classified missions and operations. I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in Army or Seal stories or anyone who is intrigued by the things that these unknown heroes do for our country while the rest of us lead our ordinary lives and take a lot of things for granted. If you're going to call him a traitor, why don't YOU go out and do what he did and see how you end up, it's very easy to point fingers and accuse when knowledge is not something you hold.raitor, why don't YOU go out and do what he did and see how you end up, it's very easy to point fingers and accuse when knowledge is not something you hold.
B005IZLPMY|4.0|this is a excellent movie, the movie have got very nice special affect . the sound is brilliant.<br /><br />thanks<br /><br />best regards
B004ADH1RI|5.0|One of the old classic movies that is great for a family night with the kids. Includes adventure, comedy, suspense.
0439023521|5.0|Loved the book! It's great for all ages! I am 40, and my daughters are 18 and 12...we all loved it! Best book I've read in a while!
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|Loved the movie version of this book!  There are very few movies that even come close to the book--this is definitely one of them.
B006BGZJJ4|1.0|As other reviewers have noted, there is a clear defect in the white insulation. My cord lasted less than 3 months (being used once or twice a month) before the insulation began cracking and peeling. I requested a return, but was told that I'd have to pay for shipping and would only receive a partial refund - ie, the shipping would cost more than the refund. Do not buy this cord!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I liked A SEA STORY because it had detailed 9/11 and hostile boardings of 9/11. It showed family strife that goes with serving. NO EASY DAY had better action, but both books are best out there! GO NAVY!
B002OSXDAU|5.0|Excellent read... awesome research into all connected topics...<br />But most of all, a thought provoking approach to thinking.<br /><br />I expected to find the book long and boring, but the gripping story line and the description of characters was just too engaging to put down.
B002DPRLEI|5.0|Great movie and was happy to be able to see it on the kindle.  I hope other Doris day movies receive the same compliments.  Her movies have always been clean funny and moral. She is a well rounded actress- singer and dancer who has provided hours of entertainment when I was able to watch her movies on DIaling for DOllars when I was in grade school.  I hope they will always be available.
030758836X|3.0|****SPOILER ALERT..SPOILER ALERT***** Do not look below if you haven't made it to the 3rd part!!!!!<br /><br />This book was great..kept my attention..really enjoyed reading it...then the 3rd part started and Amy returns to Nick..then gets pregnant and now they're forever stuck together. I would've ended it much differently..<br /><br />I don't feel like I wasted my time..but I'm a little disappointed
B008WCP2KG|5.0|Mark October 23rd on your calendars as that is the day \\"Magic Mike\\" (the box office sensation during the summer of 2012) comes to DVD and Blu Ray.<br /><br /> \\"Magic Mike\\" stars hunky Channing Tatum (in probably his best role to date) as a male stripper who decides after years of stripping for women as a sideline job that he has had enough.<br /><br /> When Mike (Tatum) befriends a young 19 year old named Adam at the beginning of the film Mike gets Adam into the stripping business only to discover that Adam gets involved with drugs which leads to many problems for the two. Mike then decides he wants to lead a \\"normal\\" life, have a relationship with a woman and settle down.<br /><br /> The movie is loosely based on Channing's own real-life as a 19 year old stripper in Florida.<br /><br /> Gay men and females will LOVE the film as not only does it show off Channing's back side (and I am not talking about his back), but the dance numbers, music and story are very strong and believable.<br /><br /> Other studs in the movie include Matt Bomer from television's \\"White Collar\\", Alex Pettyfer, Cody Horn, Joe Manganiello and Matthew McConaughey.<br /><br /> The movie was an enormous box office hit becoming the runaway hit at theatres during the summer of 2012 making over $155,000,000 at the U.S. box office alone on a $7,000,000 budget!!!<br /><br /> The special bonus features will include extended dance sequences, a featurette that contains Channing Tatum being interviewed on what it was like to get his fellow actors into the mold as male strippers and much more!<br /><br /> In July, 2012 Channing announced that the studio and he (as one of the producers) are indeed working on a sequel as the film was an enormous successs.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|i love this!! tells how long you need to charge your kindle for. its easy to understand too. also tells you what waste your battery.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This is way too much fun.  It's easy to use on my Kindle Fire, and it's really easy to get caught up in it and forget about the time.
0062059882|1.0|Yes, the book is anticlimactic.  Yes mythology is interesting.<br /><br />But, nobody warned me about the homosexual content (Not that there's anything wrong with that).  I would definitely have bought another book if I would have known.  There are plenty of other great books in the fantasy genre to waste money on something which has parts of it I find distasteful.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Absolutely loved this series of books - one of the best I have read and enjoyed- very detailed and suspenseful along with history and government dealings in Sweden which I thought were very interesting and sometimes disturbing.
B006DRVFRQ|3.0|it is cool but if you forget to refresh it won't mark your read items as read when you open your browser.
B005MMY9A8|5.0|This is one of the first movies I've watched via Amazon Prime Movies. I really liked this movie! I thought it was very well done and a very nice change from all of the blood and gore you see on so many movies and it has a very nice story line. I was afraid it was going to be a bit hokey but it was not. I recommend watching this movie!

B006LSZECO|2.0|I enjoy books that I can get something out of.  Not necessarily information, but books that can help me think more deeply about myself, my choices, my relationships, books that help me to count my blessings and that help to see my faults and shortcomings.  This book did none of the above; it was a complete waste of my time.  A lot of reviewers have complained about the end, but honestly, the entire book is ridiculously unrealistic and there is basically no protagonist in the whole story (but maybe the author wanted it that way.)  As a Midwesterner, I found the author's perception of the Midwest and Midwesterners to be negative and borderline offensive.  I actually quit reading it about half-way through, but decided to finish it because it was for a book club night that I really wanted to attend.  I cannot believe this has been on the Bestseller list. I'm ready to see copy and copy of it in my local Goodwill store very soon.
B008ODZEQ0|5.0|I loved everything about this movie, from the portrayal of an incredibly interesting individual, the gorgeous cinematography and perfectly matched soundtrack. You learn as much about this man in his words as you do from his craft, the intimate camera work and contextual scenes and candid discussions with his sons and people who interact with him daily.<br /><br />It is rare that a film moves me so emotionally, especially given the subject matter and genre, but the blending of images, setting, sound and story is immaculate. The only tip I have for you is: pray you have a good sushi restaurant near by, because you will get a sushi craving like nothing else during this film.
0425263908|2.0|On the heels of the Fifty Shades of Grey phenomenon, there were bound to be some look-a-likes floating around. Quite obvioulsy, Bared to You has been marketed to be the next Fifty Shades and so I had to pick this little treasure up and give it a try.<br /><br />Bared to You features a young woman named Eva who has recently moved to New York city. With her troubled past seeminly behind her, she looks to start fresh in the city with a new job and her best friend Cary. Of course, things never go according to plan as she meets the devistatingly hansome and weathy Gideon Cross. Together, they find that they have a lot in common and much more in the chemistry department.While their sex life may be stellar, they both have deep routed issues that they must face as a couple. These issues will either make or break their relationship and they must find out whether they are strong enough to make things work.<br /><br />I will start off by saying that I did not enjoy this book as much as I did the 50 Shades series. I've recently re-read these novels and while they are racey and have some graphic content, I still enjoyed the characters and storyline very much, probably even more when I read it the second time.<br /><br />While reading Bared to You I felt was a poor atempt at catching the E.L. James's audience. I have to admit, the story was a little more unique and the characters, especially the female lead, were different. With this being said, I still felt like I was reading a story where someone was purposefully trying to shock me, and it didn't work. I won't go into too much detail as I don't want to ruin the story for anyone, but I often times felt like Day just threw certain extra intense sex scenes into the story just to add some scandal and to be more like Fifty Shades of Grey and I didn't love it.<br /><br />I think one of the bigger problems I had with this book was the use of the \\"c\\" word. I hate that word. While there are other words used in the English Language to describe this particular part of the female anatomy, I think the \\"c\\" word is the worst. While in real life (okay, just when I'm not typing to an online audience) I have the mouth of a sailor, but that word never crosses my lips. It's demeaning and disgusting and anytime anyone uses that word around me, I wince. I think it's a horrible word and to hear it used as a sort of sexual endearment, I had to cringe.<br /><br />The characters also didn't do much for me. While Eva was  a different character than Anna from 50, Gideon was a poor mans version of Christian. I didn't believe his back story and I had a hard time falling for him, especially as the book came to a close. I just didn't find his actions and his relationship with Eva to be believable, which made it very difficult to get into the story.<br /><br />Lastly, I've heard a lot of bloggers say that they enjoyed this book more because the writing was better. While I agree that Day's writing was better edited and had more of a flow, I thought the plot was repetitive and boring. The constant running away that Eva did and the back and forth between Gideon and Eva (I want to be with you, no I don't... I want to be with you again, no I don't...etc.) grew very tiresome. I was also confused at times of the story. I felt like the pacing was off and I was rushed in some spots and in others, the story drug on too long.<br /><br />Overall, I was bored by the plot and the characters and while the writing was better, this novel didn't hold a candle to the 50 Shades of Grey books. I felt like I had to compare them because Bared to You because everywhere I went, I saw the two books together. Now, I say that I won't read book two, but I most likely will and when I do, I hope I like it better.<br /><br />Happy Reading :)<br /><br />5 out of 10scribe this particular part of the female anatomy, I think the \\"c\\" word is the worst.

B0083TXXZ4|3.0|I hesitate to write such a negative review since this may be a very fun toy when it works.  But mine did not work.<br /><br />It was reasonably easy to put together.  The only tool required was a screwdriver in order to insert the batteries.  It was a little tricky to snap a few of the pieces on, but generally not a problem.<br /><br />I had it all set up and ready to show my 4 kids.  They'd been wanting a nerf gun for a long time, and now I had what I thought was the king of all nerf guns.  I had them follow me outside so that I could show them the \\"hailstorm\\" of nerf ammo that I was about to shoot.  I pulled the launch trigger.  Nothing.  I tried several more times.  I had my husband try it.  Nothing.  We took the gun apart to see if anything was wrong.  We found that there was a piece that needed to go back further to get itself behind the Nerf pellets so that it could be pushed forward by the launch trigger to push the pellets out.  This was not something that we were supposed to have to adjust.  It was not mentioned in the product instructions at all, but it was clear to see.  Ours didn't move when the launch trigger was pulled.  So we pushed it back into its correct position by hand, put the gun back together, and got the kids all excited to see the \\"hailstorm\\" begin.  My husband pulled both the acceleration trigger and the launch trigger (as you are supposed to do), and the first dart shot out of the gun.  Then, nothing.  The acceleration trigger (not the one that had caused the problem the first time) was stuck.  The motor just kept whirring.  This is apparently a known problem, since the instruction manual gives you instructions on what to do if this happens.  We followed those instructions (which say to pull the launch trigger all the way back), but it didn't work.  The motor just keep incessantly whining and whirring and nothing would come out of the gun.  Taking the batteries out only stopped it temporarily.  Once they were in, the motor was always on.So we had to open the handle to manually fix the trigger.  That stopped it, but now it won't work at all.<br /><br />If it had worked, I do think it would have been fun, although I also thought it was very big and heavy.  It has to be, I guess, to hold so many darts and to shoot them so far, but I think the kids might tire of holding it quickly.<br /><br />So we had a lot of disappointment and only shot on pellet.

B008Z9YLV2|1.0|This  film is worse than the twilight series. It just refuses to go away.<br />Purchase on instant streaming for teen and tweens in our home. But I decided to take a<br />peek and see for myself what all the fuss was about. After about a half hour into<br />this Battle Royale rehash for American teens I felt like a deer in the headlights.<br />I shook it off and walked away from the film. Feeling slightly traumatized I picked<br />up a book and felt all the better for it.
034580404X|5.0|I love this book, a very good read.  It is very detailed, exciting, a good story line.  From the first time I started to read Fifty Shades of Grey it was hard to put it down. I usually take my time reading a book, not in any hurry, but this book, looking forward to finishing this one, so I can read the next one. The author is always keeping you wondering what is going to happen next.  I would recommend this book. I am glad that I brought the volume, because if I hadn't, I denfinitely would be looking for the other two books.
0451232852|1.0|If I wanted to read about others' sexual escapades, I could have bought a $5 romance novel and saved myself some money.  I only got through about 150 pages and didn't have any desire to finish it.  In my opinion, a good author can portray love and romance between characters without going into detail about their sexual encounters.  Instead of portraying the characters with depth and personality, the explicit sex in this book makes them look shallow and cheap.

0547260695|3.0|The pop-up art in this edition is fantastic. On some pages it is static while other pages are movable via tabs. Still others pop out in the more traditional way when the page is opened. The variety of the way the pop up art is \\"paper engineered\\" adds to the childlike wonder when viewing the world that is at the heart of this classic tale. It is almost as if the Little Prince himself designed them!<br />So why must I give this book less than 5 stars? The new Howard translation manages to take the poetic wonder of the original and reduce it to a \\"grown up\\" version devoid of much of the magic in Katherine Woods' translation. Not having the proficiency needed to read it in the original language I can not be certain if what I loved as a child and learn from again and again as I grow older is there in the words that Antoine de Saint-Exupery penned. I strongly suspect that it is, as the story has been loved by people from almost countless cultures reading in numerous languages. The Woods version, published as the official English translation for the first 55 years or so after Saint-Exupery completed the French original, certainly conveys a poetic sense of wonder that is lacking in the newer Howard account. When I ordered this edition several months ago the description stated the text was the full, unedited translation by Woods. It appears Amazon has since corrected this oversight. I'm sure I was not the only person disappointed when the book arrived to discover the text was Howard's instead of Woods' translation.<br />If you've read the Woods translation already I can recommend this edition on the strength of the pop up art. If you have not read The Little Prince I would recommend you find a used copy of the Woods translation or look for it online.

B003ZSJ212|4.0|I am a Star Wars fan no doubt, but I HAVE to admit though that even though Episodes 1, 2, & 3 look awesome on my 47\\" HDTV, Episodes 4, 5, & 6 Look TOO good.<br /><br />What I mean literally is that I felt watching the older style late-70's films was that you could see how \\"hollywood set\\" the movies are. Plastic, simple, blocky props, etc. They just felt fake in a lot of scenes, which stinks because I am so into BluRay and HD and was excited to finally have all 6 episodes in the HD box set.<br /><br />I know not everyone may agree with me on this but I actually prefer watching 4, 5, & 6 in Non-high definition format.<br /><br />At least I got it on a promotional sale and did not pay retail sticker price for it Thank Goodness!

B000FCKGPC|1.0|I got interested in this series of books by Martin by watching the HBO series.  After each episode I felt this deep sense of dissatisfaction.  The characters were flat, the plot line jumped around without giving you any \\"meat\\" .... poor character development.<br /><br />So I decided that the books \\"just have to be better\\" since many times that's the case when you move words onto the screen.  Well, I was WRONG.  The first three books were okay, then I got to this book.  I don't know how to express it properly, accept I found myself skipping chapters and wondering when ANYTHING was going to get resolved.<br /><br />I've read the reviews of the 5th book and have decided to ditch the HBO series and the books, I have better things to read and watching \\"Hoarders, Buried Alive\\" is actually more interesting.<br /><br />Don't waste your time and money on this series.  It is absolutely nothing like anything Tolkein ever wrote or other great authors like Marion Zimmer Bradley - and probably many, many others.<br /><br />There is so much potential in the original idea for this series of books that I have to just make some suggestions.<br /><br />First, the characters like Arya, Sansa, Daenarys and the other younger characters should not be children.  It would work so much better if they were in their late teens/early twenties.<br /><br />The dragons would not take an eternity to grow.  In fact by the third book they would be nearly full grown.  Why not, they're dragons after all.<br /><br />With those changes I would leave the plot line much like it is to the point that Tyrion escapes.  He would escape in a fast ship in the harbor and head for the free lands.  There he would have some interesting encounters and eventually would wind up in Daenary's court.  There after proving himself to be trustworthy and the good guy he really is, would become her counselor and friend.<br /><br />Arya would go to Braavos, actually talk with Sam Wise and learn what was going on with her family and the threat in the northlands.  She would be trained as a warrior/assassin and sent by the Brotherhood of the Many Faced God to Daenary's court and become her friend and confidant.<br /><br />Cersei would continue to be a plotting scheming \\"queen\\" contract a \\"love disease\\" and die a painful death, but just before her last breath she would tell Jaime that she always loved him and was sorry for being such a witch to him.  Jaime would become the regent and tell Temmon that he was his father - lots of tears and hugs.  Brianne would become Captain of the Kings Guard (first woman, would stir up some controversy) and things in Kingslanding would have some interesting side stories.<br /><br />As the dragons grew Daenary, Arya and Tyrion would become dragon riders.<br /><br />Mean while in the north.... Rob Stark would not have been murdered and would not marry.  He would unite with Stannis to fight the \\"evil in the frozen lands\\" and set up a kingdom at Winterfell.  Jon Snow would still command the Wall and make peace and alliance with the Wildlings (and probably marry someone really wonderful).<br /><br />Skipping right along.  The \\"evil in the north\\" would begin to move south and attack the wall.  Arya would fly north on her dragon and find Bran (who by now would be something like a wizard/Merlin type character) and unearth the old magical weapons left by the First Men that will kill the \\"evil in the north\\" with the help of the dragons and dragon riders.<br /><br />The big war begins, dragons with riders armed with the magic weapons engage in the attack (great descriptions of battles, , aided by Rob, Stannis and Jon.  At the last minute Jaime and the knights from the south join in the fight.  Big huge gut wrenching battle, Arya finally kills the really bad head evil in the north, some live, some die (probably Jaime dies to regain his honor at last and end the curse of being the \\"King Slayer\\"... maybe sacrifices himself to save Tyrion).<br /><br />Rob falls in love withDaenarys, they marry, Tyrion becomes a great counselor, Arya finally meets someone to love her (could be a girl, who knows)  and the kingdom is ruled by their descendants for 10,000 years in peace and justice.<br /><br />May be a little corny, but it might just work!Daenarys, they marry, Tyrion becomes a great counselor, Arya finally meets someone to love her (could be a girl, who knows)  and the kingdom is ruled by their descendants for 10,000 years in peace and justice.<br /><br />May be a little corny, but it might just work!

B0054JZC6E|5.0|this app is a very good time killer and I enjoy being able to earn the money by playing the games and I like the fact that they have new opportunities to get sales such as half off game price. all the games are free you only have to earn money by playing games by buying more and if you would like to purchase coins with REAL money than you can.  I do have a few suggestions though such as they should have a feature where you can go onto other users page and they can request them as neighbors and they can send them some of their money if they wish. also the users should have the opportunity to type in a idea for a new game on 101-in-1 games. overall it is a great app but with a few suggestions. I would reccomend this app.

0385342063|5.0|This book by far is my favorite book that I have read by Sophie! Now I haven't read Can You Keep a Secret yet so we will see.  The story kept my interested from beginning to end!  I was actually sad to see the book end! I loved Poppy and her whole story!  Sam was a favorite of mine too!!  I just love the way that Sophie writes and they are a funny, witty and quick read!  Enjoy!!!
B008TRUDAS|5.0|WOW! 6 stars!! What a beautiful and powerful book! Definitely a MUST read!!<br /><br />I loved this book for so many reasons... I loved that Will and Lake were wonderfully refreshing hero and heroine characters because they were realistic, smart, not annoying in any way and didn't make stupid decisions. I loved the author's writing style - its very simple but very powerful and its one of those books that really makes you feel what is going on with the characters.<br /><br />I was completely and utterly shocked to find that I loved the Slam poetry. Boy is it powerful (I know I've used that word a lot here but it seems to be the best of that fits what I'm feeling). I've always hated poetry - was never able to absorb it or relate to it but in this book, it is so effecting in giving the reader a view of what is going on in the characters' head and heart.<br /><br />I loved the intensity of Will and Lake's feelings for each other. I had butterflies in my stomach for most of the book and could stop turning the pages.<br /><br />This book brought me to tears more than once. And my cheeks were damp throughout the whole final 10% or so. Loved it!!!<br /><br />This book is about love and loss and life and death (not the death of the hero/heroine though, fear not lol).<br /><br />I'd highly highly recommend it to pretty much anyone and everyone who loves to read.<br />Now I understand what all the fuss was about - everywhere I looked here, people were raving about it and now I'm joining that club!<br /><br />I'm off to go read the sequel now - I can't wait to read more about Will and Lake...<br /><br />\\"I got schooled this year<br />by<br />a<br />Boy.<br />a boy that I'm seriously,<br />deeply, madly, incredibly,<br />and undeniably in love<br />with.<br />And he taught me the most<br />important thing of all ...<br />To put the emphasis<br />On life.\\"
B007UPNA6Y|3.0|Lee Child's Jack Reacher series is one of the best in the adventure novel genre. This is the 17th in the Jack Reacher series and IMHO is showing signs of running out of steam. I enjoyed The Affair because it was a prequel going back to his military days. It was a refreshing a break from the several post military Reacher books where he drifts across the USA on his own, with no fixed address and little identification.<br /><br />The story started like most post military Reacher stories when he walks (or more truthfully gets a lift) into a dangerous situation. For more than half of the book this is typical post military Jack Reacher where he works out how to get out of a bad situation. In the latter half of the book the plot becomes complex, difficult to follow and almost unbelievable. Reacher has always been a super hero, but in this book he becomes a mega hero taking on and defeating 26 baddies almost on his own.<br /><br />I read recently that a Jack Reacher movie is currently in production, starring Tom Cruise. Reacher is 1.95m (6ft 5inches) tall and weighs around 100-113Kg(220-250lbs) while Tom Cruise is 1.72m (5ft 7 inches) tall and weighs around 77Kg (170lbs). My mind boggles at the dissimilarity between them. If he was younger Steven Seigal (1.93m/6 foot 4 inches) would have been ideal.<br /><br />I recall this saying about your imagination when you are reading - \\"When you read, there are no limits; with a book you can bring vistas and textures and emotions to life that have a meaning to you and you alone\\". I think I will leave my imagination of Reacher untouched and opt out of the film.<br /><br />Jack Reacher fans will be pleased to know that he takes the road again at the end of the book.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I do not write reviews often but enjoyed this book so much I wanted to add my praise even though this book is so highly rated. Its one of those that you never want to put down but as you near the end you don't want to pick up and finish because you don't want it to be over. Don't let the summary make you think this is a typical dis-utopian story where a character leaves their little haven only to find that the world outside is really awful..this book is not about what is outside, its about what is inside that makes the book so good. Trust me, buy it and read it.

B008GX2YQQ|5.0|The pressure has well and truly been ramped up in anticipation of this latest Animal Collective release following as it does the commercial breakthrough album 'Merriweather Post Pavilion' and the equally impressive 'Fall Be Kind' EP. The expectations are different this time out, the last album was considered more accessible and even contained a genuine indie hit in the form of 'My Girls' - it goes without saying that many listeners will be hoping 'Centipede Hz' follows a similar path to its predecessor. After living with this album for a week I'm not convinced everyone is going to be won over by the direction the band have taken, this is abrasive, dense, busy - some will baulk at the seemingly cluttered and slippery arrangements. The closest recent parallel for me would be someone purchasing 'Embryonic' by the Flaming Lips hoping to find another 'Yoshimi', both albums are clearly the work of the same band but where the earlier album applies a smooth and clean approach to the production and keeps the writing concise the later release revels in throwing up an alien sound palette of initially perplexing and jarring noise which it marries to far looser song structures. It goes a long way to explaining why I awarded this album 5 stars when you consider I actually rated 'Embryonic' my favourite album of 2009 ahead of 'MPP'!<br /><br />'Centipede Hz' really is a full on sensory assault right from the off - after a quick snippet of radio noise 'Moonjock' jumps straight in with pounding drums and distorted vocals, as a standalone song perhaps not the band's most focused composition but it works perfectly as an extended intro here particularly because it is followed by the incredibly tight tribal meets carnival intensity of 'Today's Supernatural'. I suppose it is at this point I should point out that this album is somewhat dominated by Avey Tare vocally which is fine by me, I've always favoured his style but Lennox fans may be slightly disappointed by the lack of Panda lead vocals. This leads us neatly to track 3, a short number sung by Noah which to these ears has a touch of early Talking Heads to the guitar parts - it is a pleasant diversion but ever so slightly insubstantial.<br /><br />Luckily the album gets back on track with the simply phenomenal 'Apple Sauce' that has just got to be considered one of the band's best ever moments - the composition contains so many separate parts it is unbelievable! The chorus when it arrives for the first time (at the 1:50 mark no less!) is just so perfect for the band melodically and in particular listen out for the added detail provided by the backing vocals which take it to that extra level. Even better, just when you think they may be losing their way and milking the chorus a little too much an outro brilliantly bursts in - 'One, the eagle!!... two, the nobel!!...'. Great stuff.<br /><br />'Wide Eyed' is up next and is a bit of an Animal Collective oddity as it is sung by the returning guitarist Deakin (he sat out MPP) and it does a good job of keeping the momentum going, sounding refreshingly different to all that has preceded it. In a way it is a shame the band haven't incorporated his lead vocals in any of their past material as the only gripe I have is it does have the feel of a guest spot, especially as the rest of the band don't provide any backing vocals - perhaps this won't be a one off going forward? 'Father Time' is a classic Collective composition, it sounds vaguely tropical and is another highlight. I'm always surprised no one ever compares Portner's vocals to Perry Farrell of Jane's Addiction, there are some huge similarities in tone and inflection there - a good thing in my book!<br /><br />'New Town Burnout' is a decent Panda Bear number that builds slowly and comes into its own as the layers of samples build, by the end it has created an intoxicating atmosphere and allowed for a little respite from the full on assault of beats and harsh effects found elsewhere...although this respite proves to be a short lived as a repeated sample of machine noise heralds the start of 'Monkey Rich', a singalong Avey number with a tribal meets industrial feel and chanting vocals in the chorus - one of the more instantly catchy songs and likely to be a live favourite. 'Mercury Man' has a creepy edge with disembodied vocals somewhat rescuing the track at the end, 'Pulleys' is more satisfying and similar to 'Father Time' in being a more typical Animal Collective tune. The disc is rounded off by the excellent and suitably grand 'Amanita' which adds a touch of Eastern flair to the mix, the song gets increasingly psychedelic and distorted as it races to its conclusion.<br /><br />I can see why this album might get a bashing from some quarters and I can also agree that 'Centipede Hz' may not be the certified improvement/refinement of 'Merriweather Post Pavilion' we perhaps expected but as a fan of Animal Collective at their most intense and discordant and as someone who really enjoyed the challenging 'Strawberry Jam' and similarly no holds barred releases from other artists ('Embryonic' and Sufjan Steven's 'Age of Adz' spring to mind) I have to applaud the band for releasing such a uniquely different recording once again - as always essential.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|The prose in Wool Omnibus is close to being as finely tuned as Bernard Cornwell's prose in The Warlord Chronicles.  Excellent descriptive scenes, strongly drawn characters, and a plot that keeps you guessing through a good part of the book.<br /><br />The action scenes are compelling, and quickly draw you into the scene.<br /><br />Overall an excellent light sci-fi read!
0380730405|5.0|The first book in quite a while that I had trouble putting down. Takes you back to feelings you had when you were a young lady with a lot of insecurities. I loved how she described the setting of Manderley.  A perfect blend of romance, psychological drama with a little bit of spooky thrown in. A fairly easy read. I watched Alfred Hitchcock's movie the next day which was good but I didn't enjoy it nearly as much as the book.
B001CDHDM2|5.0|this is the best of both worlds. joe is simply 1 of my fav composers of all time. he has such a way with his music that u'd just want to here a track more then once. he really does the movies he composes justice in evry way. u can tell he puts great heart and effort in his work. the music just grabs u in every way.<br />  and as for kitano.....this man is just legendary in his films. every piece he does is truly amazing and memorable. not to mention his artistic and comedic eye he adds on the big screen. i followed his work ever since i saw the movie 'brother' which was my 1st kitano film. and after that i just had to see more of his work. i consider at least 80% of his movies to be favs of mines, to many to list here. but this man sure has an eye for entertainment.<br />  as for the soudtrack itself, its just the best of evrything. my only regret is that i wish there was more music in it, like the music from 'zatoichi' which joe and kitano also worked on. other that i must had burned through this soundtrack a 100 times already for this is truly a must have for any kitano and joe fan. and the best part is you get the best of both worlds in 1 soundtrack.

B008MG1E4A|4.0|I had been waiting for No Easy Day to come out since I started hearing all the hoopla about the trauma this book would inflict on the entire SEAL community due to security & sensitive material being leaked to the general public. I read the book in one day, feeding my family sandwiches for dinner so I could keep reading. I thought it was well written and gave great insight into what these men do for our country. The sacrifices they make in their personal lives to defend our country is truly humbling.<br /><br />The only thing I took exception with was the cavalier attitude regarding combat dogs. Now I'm sure in the grand scheme of things people will think I just had to find something to gripe about - I did. Just tossing a dog out of an airplane, or sending the dog over a ridgeline first only to find it dead when our troops go over the ridgeline is just wrong. How many dogs have you seen lined up at the military recruiment office begging to be a SEAL dog? What is their reward for this? An unlimited supply of milkbones? Shame on us for treating animals with no dignity.<br /><br />Good book, very well written & I would recommend it for anyone who thinks our military personnel are not worth extra pay, benefits for their families, aid when they return from combat or that there is so such thing as PTSD.

0375758992|5.0|Those who are upset or dissatisfied with \\"Don't Let's Go to the Dogs Tonight\\" tend to be too concerned with the fact that it didn't meet their own expectations of what a white person should think and feel about Africa. Women's issues, the treatment of Black Africans, and the Rhodesian War, for example. Fuller and her family are not members of a privileged, white ruling class, as some reviewers would have you believe. I inferred from the book that they are relatively poor, rootless, and prone to drink. They stay in Africa, even after the end of white-rule, because of a love of the land and the people.<br /><br />Fuller tells her story of an African youth the way it happened, and makes no apologies. \\"Don't Let's\\" is a terrifically interesting book, told from the point of view of someone who struggled time and time again and survived to tell about it.

No doubt, cognitive skill and IQ make a big difference, and vocabulary matters. But the psychologists and neuroscientists researching, studying development and education are challenging the idea that IQ test scores, are the only concern in a child's success.<br /><br />Paul Tough argues in How Children Succeed, that the qualities which matter most are linked to character. Those core skills, like curiosity, awareness, optimism, and perseverance are a lot more crucial to the cause of success. He argues there exists now lots of evidence that supports those vital strengths of character rather than the cognitive skills, being at least as fundamental in a child's progress, \\"and quite possibly more important,\\" says Tough.<br /><br />How Children Succeed introduces parents and educator to new concepts researchers and psychologists uncover the secret clues to character, while applying the tools of science, for the first time since the reformed system of free grammar schools was established in modern British education system. Tough follows the links between stress and childhood early success, to uncover the surprising ways  parents prepare their children for adulthood.<br /><br />Paul Tough themes will not only engage readers, but could change our understanding of childhood development in aware and responsible adulthood, provides us with new insights into how to help children growing up. This illuminating and inspiring book could motivate a change to the ways parents raise their children, and how educators plan educational systems and run schooling, which could change how 21st century America may reform our social safety net.minating and inspiring book could motivate a change to the ways parents raise their children, and how educators plan educational systems and run schooling, which could change how 21st century America may reform our social safety net.

It does everything it says it does and more - you can even personalize it a bit by choosing the color of the battery. Where it's dark blue here you can change it to whichever one you choose on a color wheel.<br />It also shows you which apps use more power than they need to run and shows you ways to lower it and save battery power. There's a graph that charts your power usage as well and in the settings you can have it alert you when your battery reaches a power level of your choosing. As if that wasn't enough if tells you how much time you have to perform certain activities with your current level of power and how much time you have until it's completely charged. There's also a feature that calibrates the app with your device so your readings are more accurate. I'm VERY happy with this app.
B0016OLC5Q|4.0|Look, nowadays, a cheesy afterschool special featuring \\"Billy\\" trying to say \\"no\\" to the drug dealers that live in his southside apartment complex is just not going to cut it for getting wisdom across to the next generation. (heck, I don't even think it worked with mine!) A movie like this, however, it just perfect.  Just when we think we can make our future dreams be today, right now, instantly gratified, a movie like this comes along, and shows us what happens when someone actually cuts past all other things in life to that.  We die young, inside and/or out. A young man seeing his future as an old man, cannot be an old man overnight.  And that's what Christopher tried to do. The people he met along the way and what they gave him were what he was actually seeking the whole time: Love.<br />Eddie Vedder makes a great soundtrack, the cast was perfect, Sean Penn does some fantastic directing, and it really makes a perfect film to pass along to someone who feels discontent, anger, youth angst, or whatever about how they were raised or where they grew up.  (Not to down play AT ALL how he was raised.  That is not easy to overcome, and tends to create a somewhat delusional person). This movie does a much better job at getting a message through, and if someone still wants to venture the same road, by all means! At least, they'll know to bring a compass and a map and maybe research survival techniques before heading out to the great unknown.<br />I love the ending because his conclusion is what was before him the whole time: Happiness is best when shared.

B00866JL96|4.0|By Jim Clark, publisher, Lee County Courier, Tupelo, MS<br /><br />U.S. Marine Logan Thibault (Zac Efron) is on his third tour of duty in Iraq. He's sitting in rubble waiting for orders after surviving a night raid. Something in the debris catches his eye. It's a photo of a pretty girl. On the back is written \\"keep safe x.\\" Just then a mortar lands where he had been sitting, killing those in the immediate area.<br />Stunned but glad to be alive Logan carries the photo around asking others in his platoon if they recognize the girl or know who the picture belongs to. No one does.<br />Just prior to returning home, Logan and a fellow soldier are driving and joking about the picture. The humvee is taken out by a roadside bomb. One dies. Logan lives. He convinces himself that he's carrying a photo of his guardian angel.<br />Logan tries to resettle in his native Colorado, but the only one he can get along with is Zeus, his German Shepherd.<br />He has spent time researching a lighthouse which appears in the photo and determines it was taken in Louisiana. So he sets out with his dog to locate his guardian angel.<br />He finds her where she works at a dog kennel. The lady Beth Clayton (Taylor Schilling) finds it weird that a grown man would walk with his dog from Colorado to Louisiana. So she is wary. Her grandmother, Ellie (Blythe Danner) sees something else and offers Logan a job. Beth is irritated by his presence, but begins to warm to the soldier because he develops a good relationship with her son, Ben.<br />Beth's ex is a sheriff's deputy, and the son of the town's judge, who will do anything to send Logan in another direction.<br />It's a love story, but along the way, teaches important lessons.
B00006I53S|2.0|I'm an amateur moving to pro so my review is geared towards folks that are looking for a medium-wide zoom lens. There are some things I've learned over the past couple of years. 1) Prime lenses are always going to look sharper and have greater saturation than zoom lenses. 2) The Canon 28-135mm has lost a lot of perfectly focused shots for me.<br /><br />It's a pretty cheaply constructed lens with a lot of dust getting inside of the lens (no amount of self-cleaning can remove it, must be sent to Canon). I'm now building up a small arsenal of prime lenses and shopping the 17-40mm as my walk-around.
B005LAJ16I|4.0|By Jim Clark, publisher, Lee County Courier, Tupelo, MS<br /><br />Carrie Mathison (Claire Danes) is a CIA operations officers working in Iraq. She has an asset in prison who is about to be executed. He has information she wants. He tells her she can't help him now. Carrie convinces him she can help keep his family safe.<br />He tells her that an American prisoner of war had been turned by Al-Qaeda.<br />During a Delta Force raid, Nicholas Brody (Damian Lewis), a U.S. Marine Sergeant, is rescued. He has been a prisoner of war for eight years.<br />Jessica Brody (Morena Baccarin) and his two children, Chris and Dana had suspected he'd been killed. Nicholas' best friend and fellow Marine, Mike, also thought him dead so eventually began a relationship with Jessica.<br />Carrie is convinced Nicholas is part of a sleeper cell, waiting to carry out another terrorist attack on American soil.<br />Homeland is the best post-911 show I've come across. As an audience member I was continually trying to figure out if Nicholas really is the bad guy, or perhaps some kind of double agent deep under cover.<br />I am not alone. The pilot episode received 1.08 million viewers, becoming Showtime's highest-rated drama premiere in eight years. At the 69th Golden Globe Awards Claire won \\"Best Actress in a Drama Series.\\"  Homeland also won \\"Best New Series\\" from the Writers Guild of America Awards 2011.<br />It earned a season 2 -- production began in May 2012 where the series films in Tel Aviv, Israel for two weeks.
1419701533|5.0|Awesome read for kids as young as 6 year old and equally enjoyable by adults.  A must have for all kids.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I realy enjoyed this book.  A first hand look at what happened to this most wanted person.  I could not put it down and read on until I finished.  Appreciated the Ending pages, giving honor to those we lost.  I know my husband and others will enjoy this one.<br /><br />The only people that, in my opinion, who will not enjoy it are those who made up their own accounts of what happened.  WOW, what liars.
B0079XPUOW|5.0|Yet another great book by John Scalzi.  Scalzi's storying-telling style and creativity makes him such an outstanding original and, for me, the Scalzi brand is something I actively track in anticipation of his next release. I think of \\"Redshirts\\" as fitting into a sci-fi genre that is coolly clever and hip; it definitely put a smile on my face from the first chapter, and was often laugh-out-loud funny. I suppose that to realy appreciate the story one needs to have been a fan of Star Trek - but i thi thats a good thing. Plenty of page-turning suspense and just an overall really cool idea for a story - a story which is so much the better because it's John Scalzi telling it, with his characteristic blend of solid sci-fi and unique and unmistakeable Scalzi wit.
B008EQIEWS|4.0|good movie. The first time my 12-year old watched it on TV with his older cousin, he got nightmare. But he couldn't help wanting to watch it again.<br />I consider it is okay.
B000E8QVWY|3.0|Joaquin Phoenix takes on the early life and times of Johnny Cash, with something more than an assist from Reese Witherspoon as June Carter. It's great material, more factual than many dramaticized biopics, but seems like it's always standing just a hair away from fully embracing the man and his mythos. Phoenix emphatically pours himself into the role, but can't quite nail the man's authoritative, larger-than-life presence either on the stage or off it. That, along with his ever-so-slightly imperfect take on Cash's legendary singing voice, had me seeing the Oscar nominee as a tremendous impersonator but not a living, breathing character unto himself. Surprisingly, Witherspoon fares much better in a role that seemed on the surface to be terribly miscast. She's sweet, streetsmart and talented, and much of the trauma we endure from Cash's self-inflicted trouble is drawn from the toll it takes on her. An ambitious picture that has its heart in the right place, but can't fully recover from a few crucial, disappointing near-misses.
B004DI7HZ6|2.0|As someone who is fascinated by both fiction and non-fiction writings about witches and vampires, I was definitely motivated to read this book and became engrossed pretty quickly.  The main character, Diana, came off as strong but not uniformly so, and the writing was quite eloquent at times.  However, as my title denotes, this did not last.  By about the mid-point of the book, I started to lose interest.  The characters lost their depth, and even the supposed plot twists became predictable.  In the end, I felt that it was an interesting story that got away from the author.  Here are some additional specifics...<br /><br />CHARACTERS<br />Pros:<br />The characters are generally complex and real (at least early on).  They have strengths and faults, and, even though they are creatures, their behaviors are contextualized in ways that make you feel as though you understand these people/beings.  I liked Diana a lot in the early pages.  Although I don't think she presents as a thirty-something academic very well, she seems like a real person.  The vampires are more a mixed bag with respect to their depth, but generally I liked the way the author conveyed them in the gray area between right and wrong.<br /><br />Cons:<br />The characters, good and bad, became more unidimensional as the story went on. The bad guys became just bad and the good guys became (mostly) just good.<br /><br />Some characters seemed to be introduced as an afterthought because some aspect of the story were not falling into place properly.  This made the story meander more than it needed to.<br /><br />THE LOVE STORY<br />Pros:<br />Although I rarely admit it, I can get engulfed in a good love story.  In this case, it is a classic forbidden love but with a supernatural twist.  As it started to unfold, I enjoyed the tension of not knowing whether I wanted it to be successful or not.<br /><br />Cons:<br />The emergence of the love story was too obvious too early.<br /><br />The main characters become particularly nauseating as their relationship develops.  My guess is that the author was trying to capture the ferocity of love that comes with finding the right person (something everyone should be lucky enough to experience), but it comes off as more and more childish over time.<br /><br />By the end of the book, the Bishop house was my favorite character.<br /><br />THE INTERTWINING OF WORLDS<br />Pros:<br />The intertwining of the occult world and the modern world was fascinating.  The presence of creatures in every day life was handled with a lot of finesse that made suspension of disbelief very easy.  I even felt myself looking around the world and imagining that we, as humans, might actually be living in such a world.  I really enjoy books that can do that.<br /><br />Cons:<br />The collision of worlds became too predictable, and the human side of things all but disappeared.  As a result, I stopped feeling that sense of being able to feel a part of the story world and felt like an outsider reading about a world that I could not engage.  This was probably the biggest disappointment in a book so long.  By the last 200 pages, I felt like I was reading just to get it over with.<br /><br />Finally, I think Harkness is a talented storyteller and writes very appealing prose.  I just think this book needed some serious and strong editing to make it hang together.  Now, I will have to decide if the strengths are enough to get me to try the sequel.
B0058S0OMS|5.0|This movie is an instant classic! It is a must have! Any Halloween fan needs to add this to their collection!

0345803485|1.0|Heard a lot about this book. Picked it up in London (over paid for it) with great anticipation for a good read on a long flight home. You must be kidding! It reads at a 5th grade level. He has grey eyes and a smirking smile. She bites her lip. I kept waiting for some character development or depth. Neither happened. I forced myself to complete in hopes something (anything) would happen. Not for me.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Fifty Shades Trilogy was excellent. I read the books because everyone was talking about the books.  No on mentioned the story and I was pleasantly surprise that the books had a very good storyline. I'm looking forward to seeing the movies. Today the news reported that Ryan Gosling may play Gray. Perfect choice if it is true. I would definitely read other books from this author.

B00138KDO6|5.0|My first indoctrination into Rage music was a video from their first album, \\"Freedom\\". It tells the story of a Native American Indian, Leonard Peltier, who was found guilty in 1977 of murdering 2 FBI agents. The song's lyrics struck a chord with me personally because I have been a follower of Leonard's case (and cause) for a long time. Without getting into a long discussion of how he was railroaded by our government and denied a fair trial by the bureaucratic system of our courts, the song was not only a calling out of the \\"Machine\\", but the music surrounding it was  outstanding and nothing short of heroic. I personally became an instant fan and have been a die hard follower of them ever since.<br /><br />Whether you're a fan of only the music, like Paul Ryan, or are a hardcore fan due not only to the greatness of the musicians but the heavy undertones of the lyrics, this band of artists is not to be missed. This album is just another example in a line of greatness for these talented individuals. And bless Tom Morello for putting into awesome perspective the hypocrisy of one sad individual, Republican VP nominee Paul Ryan, for loving the riffs but not paying one ounce of attention to the real message of this bands' music. Ryan has just proven again of how far-off politicians are from the heartbeat of America. Of course, you'd have to go far away from Fox News to have seen anything of Morello's response to Ryan's total ignorance, but one sided reporting by the clueless worshipers of anything elephantine working at that \\"news\\" network is nothing new.

This book is one that I won't easily forget.
B007B6T3K4|3.0|The small demo songs seemed really cool.  It's just that an entire album of the music gets a bit much.  I'm not sure why.  I didnt make it through the first listening without fast forwarding most songs.  Bad sign...
B00008DDHY|3.0|I'm working backwards through Director Paul Greengrass' body of work starting with \\"United 93\\" then \\"The Bourne Supremacy.\\"  I never heard of \\"Bloody Sunday\\" the movie or the event, which happened when I was a young adult.<br /><br />I can see why Paul Greengrass was chosen to direct \\"United 93\\" because of \\"Bloody Sunday,\\" as Director Greengrass said in the bonus material on \\"United 93.\\"<br /><br />In \\"Bloody Sunday\\" Director Greengrass is  recounting an horrific event.  All is done in hand held letting us be right next to the charactor.<br /><br />The only thing missing in \\"Bloody Sunday\\" is the big budget like Director Greengrass' following works:<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000GH3CR0 United 93 (Widescreen Edition)]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0002ZDVEU The Bourne Supremacy (Widescreen Edition)]]
0006513778|5.0|Hercule Poirot is by far my favorite detective in any mystery book. His ingenious ways of solving mysteries, his appearance and his \\"grey cells\\" complete one of the most interesting detectives of all time. This is the complete collection of his SHORT STORIES, these are not complete book. I read a number of reviews complaining that the text was too small... IT WAS FINE! I had no trouble reading it and considering how many stories are there, the text is perfect. A great buy.
B00395ZYVS|5.0|This is a must read for all mothers and daughters.  The characters were so real and I loved how some of them grew in the story and I could feel the pain of both the birth and adoptive mother.  The author did a wonderful job of making India come alive for me and I could imagine myself there with its poverty, sounds and smells.  This a a wonderful book and I encourage everyone to read it.

B000TXZVGQ|5.0|I was ending high school when I started watching My So-Called Life. But I watched them when they were playing on Mtv. I didn't know the show started on ABC. I was just starting life, But still enjoyed watching this show. The show made me miss all of the high school years. All of the love, hate, friendship, and drama.<br /><br />Now I am 28 and married. My husband and I don't have any kids. We have been married for 7 years. I am now able to identify with this movie in a different way. I  identify with the Chase parents. We might not be as old as they are, but I see a lot of my husband in Graham and a lot of me in Patty.<br /><br />I wish this show never ended. It is a joy to watch. I even got my husband watching it with me. I read the book that comes with this show and it sounds like they had great plans for more My So-Called Life show's. Graham would have left Patty. Patty would have gone into a depression. Angela would have to take care of the household because Patty was too depressed to get out of bed. Ricks teacher would have been going threw fights to keep his job after the school board fond out Ricky is living with him. Patty comes out of her depression trying to help Ricky and the teacher. Sharon would have ended up pregnant. I don't know about you, but all of that sounds like a great show.<br /><br />Even though this series isn't complete I am happy to own it. I lived life like Angela. I had good strict parents. I lived in a nice house. I made friends with people who lived different then me. I was a crazy in love. The scene when Jordan grabs Angela's hand while walking down the schools hall made my heart go back to those special moments in high school. I even have to rewind that scene a few times.<br /><br />I think the Christmas episode with Ricky's hard life is very sad and hard to watch. I didn't have any friends who were homeless like Ricky was, but it was still heartbreaking to watch. This whole series is great and I don't think any teen or even young adults show pass this up.ults show pass this up.

B000DWMYQ8|3.0|Look, even if these movies are for kids, can't the bastards in Hollywood TRY to be a little creative? Would it really kill them? It's the same plot, again and again and again: a kid is an outsider in his society; he is ridiculed, he makes major mistakes, his parents can't relate to him (especially his father), but he has a certain ability and he ends up saving his town/village/world/family from certain destruction, at which point everyone realizes he's just great and the feel bad about having demeaned him in the past.<br /><br />HOW TO TAME YOUR DRAGON---the son of a Viking chief is a misfit, living in a village harassed by dragons. The son, who is an inventor of sorts, brings down a dragon with a catapult, then befriends said dragon. Boy saves village.<br /><br />PARANORMAN---the son of a fat man is able to see and speak with dead people. Other live people cannot do so, so they think that he's nuts. He lives in a Salem-style village where a witch was hanged centuries ago. The witch comes back to destroy village. Dead people give the boy clues to stop her. Boy saves village.<br /><br />CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS---the son of a shopkeeper is an inventor whose inventions cause havoc. He invents a machine that turns rain into any kind of food. The village becomes famous. Unscrupulous mayor wrecks machine, which goes totally out of control and starts to destroy village. Boy saves village.<br /><br />CHICKEN LITTLE---the son of a rooster causes an alarm in the village because he thinks that the sky is falling when a metallic object falls from the sky. He is ridiculed for the panic. Another object falls and the village is attacked by space aliens. Chick saves village.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I love all of nicholas sparks books. I found this one enjoyable because of the different pov's, especially her husband. I've never experienced or known anybody in a abusive relationship but I feel like this book really portrays the emotional and physical tolls that kind of relationship can take on and woman and her husband. It's definitely a book that's hard to set down and keeps you on edge as she stumbles through life in her own.

The best part about Gabaldon's writing (as I have cautioned readers new to the series) is that no one is forgotten.  Take note of everyone who crosses their paths.  Everything is explained, sooner, or, perhaps, later.  I love the series.  Am about to start #5, had to take a break (family and business, you know).  Can't wait to get started again.  In a word....... WOW!

030758836X|2.0|Just finished reading the book and feel ripped off.  I was not expecting such a let down of an ending, I am left adrift.  I dislike endings that leave it up to your imagination.  The only other thing I can think the author was thinking was she would leave room for a sequel. Either that or she just got tired and thought \\"I will let the reader decide how it ends.\\"  Without giving away the plot, the story was left unfinished. I agree with the reviewer who said she didnt care if it ended happy or sad but at least have an ending.<br /><br />I totally was into the psycho drama and the language didnt offend me a bit.  The ending offended me!  Ugggghhh
B000FC1MM8|5.0|Michael Connelly writes a fabulous story. His Harry Bosch series always have well developed characters and intricate plots that make you keep reading.

0345803485|5.0|This book is fantastic.  I have NEVER written any reviews on Amazon, but I had to write this one. Yes this book is erotic but the storyline between Christian and Ana is what got me.  You feel so connected with the characters in the book.  This book makes you happy, sad, mad, and it defiantly has a shock factor.  Everyone should read it.  If you read the first one book you will read all three.  Get some caffeine in your system because this book is a page turner.

B007PF7MGS|5.0|I was inspired by the movie Forks Over Knives, but was a bit skeptical of the seemingly wild claims until I read The China Study (the foundation for Forks Over Knives).  But I still did not completely understand how to adopt this way of eating.  I also had several questions about vitamins and supplements.  The Starch Solution answered all my questions, and covered other important issues I had not even considered.  The Starch Solution is much, much more than a diet book - it is a complete & practical education in nutrition for the layman.<br /><br />Also noteworthy is the excellent selection of recipes.  The Tunisian Sweet Potato Stew is now my favorite meal.  These recipes were key to getting my wife and I past the initial withdrawal from the fatty Standard American Diet.  To those considering adopting this diet, be sure to give it a 100% trial for a few weeks.  It takes this long for one's palate to adapt, so that the flavor of the whole foods can be fully appreciated.  Fatty foods are truly an addiction, so half-measures probably won't work.  For me, it was important to follow Dr. McDougall's advice regarding salt - a little salt applied at the table is OK, and it makes all the difference for some recipes.<br /><br />After four months, I have dropped 25 pounds to a stable BMI of 20.  I have given up all supplements and my statin (I did start taking B-12).  My total cholesterol is at 149 (and still dropping).  All my 'plumbing' is working way better than it ever did, and I feel great.  I believe I have significantly reduced my chances of developing arteriosclerosis, diabetes, cancer, and every other 'disease of affluence'.  I no longer feel I am doomed to the heart disease that has afflicted all of the men in my family tree.<br /><br />Thank you Dr. McDougall - you have made a profound and positive impact on my life.

B000XCZGV8|3.0|When as a child growing up in the Bay Area he was told by his father that the notorious serial killer the Zodiac had announced he was targeting children on school buses, David Fincher says he discovered the ultimate boogeyman for his childhood. His haunting by the case inspired his first movie ever about serial killers, the beautiful and memorably cruel SE7EN, and then later resulted in this extremely elaborate recreation of the Zodiac's murders and the attempts by three men (a cartoonist for the San Francisco Chronicle, his reporter colleague, and a local detective) in solving the killer's identity (which to this day remains officially unsolved, though the film makes clear who the three men think committed the murders). By focusing on the puzzle-solvers rather than on the committing of the crimes themselves (which are disposed of nearly completely in the film's first half) or the victims, Fincher is truer to his interests but makes a duller and less engaging movie than he might have otherwise. He seems to care very little about the Zodiac's victims or their families or the survivors of his crimes. The murders are re-staged with painstaking scrupulousness to detail, but except for a lovely beginning sequence of two of the most famous of the Zodiac's victims meeting to drive to a lover's lane amidst a trippy Independence Day evening celebration in a local neighborhood, there's no sense of the victims really as people at all. The stakes of the film are thus not very high: all you care about in the end is seeing the puzzle solved for its own sake.<br /><br />Exacerbating the problem is the thinness of the three central protagonists. Although Jake Gyllenhaal brings his beautiful haunted eyes to the role of the cartoonist, he doesn't really flesh out the part beyond the descriptors of \\"obsessed\\" and \\"former Eagle Scout.\\" Robert Downey Jr. relies on tricks he uses far too often playing yet another loveable mouthy screw-up with substance abuse problems; only Mark Ruffalo,as his darkest and most intense, seems to generate much heat as the grouchy detective. There are beautiful sequences in the film, mostly at what would be its most difficult junctures, i.e. to show the considerable passing of time: one involves a beautiful CGI re-creation of the building of the Transamerica Pyramid (via simulated time-lapse photography). Fincher is marvelous as solving technical problems but fails to solve the larger problem of making the story involving for audiences not as obsessed with the Zodiac case as he himself already is. The film is much longer than it needed to be, and much less exciting. The two-disc director's cut is worth seeing for two excellent appended documentaries, one about the case against Arthur Leigh Allen, the prime suspect in the case, and the other (of particular beauty and elegance) about the four certain murderous attacks of the Zodiac killer, which involves interviews with the detectives and policemen originally on the cases and the two survivors of the attacks.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I recommend this book to any person who wants to know the real events behind the killing of Osama Bin Laden. As usual the so called news media has reported nothing but what they could make up and hype up. The politicians made hay  of the story for political gain. But the real story is here, in these pages.

159562015X|1.0|Yes, you get to take the test and then it gives you your top 5 strengths.  What it fails to do is allow for you to revisit when circumstances have changed and time has passed.  What they do offer is a line about proven science etc etc.  Myers Briggs and many others all explain that our strengths may indeed change based on life experiences, Gallup says they don't OR in the inverse they welcome you to buy ANOTHER copy of the same book to get the same information you already have in the book (wasteful but profitable for them) and possibly a different test result.  You can do better than this book and the information it provides.

B005LAJ212|5.0|My 13 year old daughter and I got into this show late last season...had originally blown it off as nothing that would interest either of us....newsflash....we were wrong. Other than the gorgeous Madeline Stowe, I saw nothing worthwhile in the previews to make me think my time would be well spent watching what I guessed was a crappy attempt at night time soap opera material. This show is wildly creative and smart! The bad guys are top of the line, (the entire Grayson family) the accessory's to the crimes are entertaining and funny (Nolan!!)and our female heroine, yes heroine, is bad ass and afraid of nothing!!! My daughter and I bonded every week as we tried to guess what would happen next. So glad to get this dvd set before the show returns this fall so we can watch it all and figure out what we dont understand.<br />Surprised by how well written this show is, surprised at the acting, which is better than I expected and thrilled to have a new lead female character to root for every week now that I have broken my daughter out of the Bella trance. :)

B0073XV2W2|4.0|An Imaginative, technically believable thriller that keeps you on the edge of your ejection seat.  The conspiracy part gets a little heavy at times and is less than believable, but if you get by that, its a book that is hard to put down.
B00499LTLM|5.0|It's a shame CBS will try to produce their own/Americanized \\"Sherlock\\" this fall.  Regardless of how audiences take to it or don't, you should consider watching what inspired a major American network to resurrect the 100+ year old consulting detective.  With a proper nod to Doyle's classic material, which the series writer draw more than just mild inspiration from, the stories here are rich.  Layers of plot, true mystery, with witty dialogue and excellent casting.  Benedict is fantastic as Sherlock and \\"that little hobbit\\" next to him isn't too bad as Dr. Watson either.  It's probably important that anyone used to traditional television episodes note that \\"Sherlock\\" is really a series of mini-movies.  Each episode is 90 minutes or so and when you see the production value (which justifies a HD viewing), you'll understand why only 3 episodes per season.  Smarter than 99% of television shows today ... this show is designed for a viewer who doesn't mind a little thinking while watching the idiot box.  If you're brain needs mental cotton candy instead of fiber, stick to NCIS.

B000VOC90Y|5.0|I searched for two months for the right backpack by reading reviews. This is exactly why I am leaving one, to help you also decide which one is right for you. I'm a full-time college student. This bag is very strong, can hold all the books I need at a time. The zippers are unique in the way that they slide so effortlessly. It has every pocket you could imagine along with a top pocket that I put my cell, sunglasses, car keys and wallet in. A mesh pocket on each side to carry a water bottle in each. I have a 15\\" laptop that fits this bag with room for a larger one. The laptop compartment is in the back. However, its holder is on the opposite side as your back, unlike most other bags I found. I love this. It is very padded and protected. I'm also a very small lady and noticed that the shoulder straps are comfortable even with the weight of the books in my bag. As far as Swiss Gear itself, I've seen many others in college who have chosen their brand of laptop/backpack as well. I'm 100% happy with my purchase.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I love this app. It is easy to use and does everything I need it to do. I am able to put appointments on the calendar as well as have a check list of things that need done throught the week.
B008133DO8|5.0|Professor Moriarty ... that's the central player of this season. No surprise assuming you've already watched season 1 (highly recommended) and you recall the season ending cliff hanger.  All three episodes are entertaining but Sherlock faithful will be truly rewarded by the season finale.  Without any spoilers, I'd only say that Season 3 will find our central characters changed profusely.  As with Sherlock season 1, the production value is outstanding (HD recommended), dialogue crackles and the acting is terrific.  If you enjoyed season 1, season 2 is a must!

B00008G7UF|4.0|I endorse the good reviews of this movie. Worth every penny. In fact, I've owned a copy for several years and wanted to have a widescreen version instead of the letterboxed one, so I ordered this version that is described as \\"widescreen, 2.73 ratio\\" and so forth.<br /><br />Just arrived, and it's the same as the earlier version with only the DVD cover changed. Still low-resolution letterbox format. I need subtitles these days to help with the dialogue, so I can choose to blow up the image and lose the subtitles or watch a movie that fills only half my high-resolution television screen.<br /><br />This is still a very fun movie to watch and not worth returning at this low price, but the DVD is disappointing.<br /><br />I'll give it to someone and be glad I've got a copy, even in letterbox format.

055357342X|5.0|A Storm of Sword is the third book in the Song of Ice and Fire series (after A Game of Thrones and A Clash of Kings, and before A Feast for Crows, A Dance with Dragons, The Winds of Winter (forthcoming) and A Dream of Spring (forthcoming)). Since I have read the UK paperback edition of this book, which is split into two volumes, I have written two reviews. Here they are:<br /><br />***Part One - Steel and Snow: When even the hero might not make it...***<br /><br />Pieces continue moving across the huge chessboard of Westeros.<br /><br />Against her son's orders, Catelyn Stark has sent her hostage Jaime Lannister to Casterly Rock, escorted by Brienne of Tarth, in exchange for her daughters Sansa and Arya. Returning to Riverrun, King Robb also has a surprise for his mother, which might jeopardize certain alliances.<br /><br />While Arya and Gendry are trying to reach Riverrun, Bran and his new friends Jojen and Meera Reed are fleeing Winterfell towards the Wall, following Bran's dream visions.<br /><br />Beyond the Wall, Jon Snow has infiltrated Mance Rayder's Wildlings. He's falling in love with the warrior Ygritte.<br /><br />After the battle at King's Landing, the Onion Knight, Davos Seaworth, has been rescued from the sea and taken prisoner in Stannis Baratheon's dungeons.<br /><br />Sansa is still trapped in Casterly Rock with her betrothed King Joffrey, while the latter's mother Queen Cersei and uncle Tyrion the Imp are plotting against each other.<br /><br />In the East, Daenerys, accompanied by her dragons and Ser Jorah Mormont, is buying slaves and setting them free, building herself an army to reconquer Westeros.<br /><br />You'd think that after a while I'd have learned that with George RR Martin, nothing ever goes as planned. But no, I still hope for the good to triumph once in a while. And they don't. One step forward, at least two steps back... but that's actually what makes this grim tale so gripping, when you're not even sure the hero, at least, is going to make it.<br /><br />***Part Two - Blood and Gold: (...and doesn't) Hecatomb!***<br /><br />In this volume, we follow Danaerys in the East, as she makes her way towards the Narrow Sea, conquering cities and building her army with the help of her dragons.<br /><br />In Westeros, Arya Stark is still trying to go to Riverrun to join her mother, but it seems like everyone is set on putting stokes in her wheels! Meanwhile, Catelyn and Robb are on their way to the Twins, to make amends with the Freys by marrying Edmure Tully, Catelyn's brother, to Roslin, Robb's former betrothed.<br /><br />Jamie Lannister decides to save Brienne from Vargo Hoat and takes her with him to King's Landing, where Sansa and Tyrion are preparing for Joffrey's wedding to Maergery Tyrell. How will Queen Cersei react when she sees her beloved brother in this diminished state?<br /><br />On Dragonstone, Davos the Onion Knight is trying to save Robert's bastard Edric Storm from Stannis and Melisandre's sacrificial impulses, whereas further North, Jon is coming back to the Wall to defend it against Mance Ryder's army of Wildlings.<br /><br />Maybe the overlarge cast needed some trimming indeed, and I surely should have seen it coming, but I'm still a little shocked at how many central characters George RR Martin manages to kill off in half a volume! I'm not sure there's a causal link, but this installment might actually be the one I enjoyed the most, so far. More action and intrigue, and fewer chapters on military planning must have made the difference.ng to make it.<br /><br />***Part Two - Blood and Gold: (...and doesn't) Hecatomb!***<br /><br />In this volume, we follow Danaerys in the East, as she makes her way towards the Narrow Sea, conquering cities and building her army with the help of her dragons.<br /><br />In Westeros, Arya Stark is still trying to go to Riverrun to join her mother, but it seems like everyone is set on putting stokes in her wheels!

0525953728|3.0|I do not agree with the book coming out and violating the code of silence of SEALS.  Proceeds should go to the families of those fallen in battle.<br /><br />As for the book, it is just another recount of one soldier's story of how he got to be a seal and his journey into a mission.  You will not find details that you might be thinking are secret.  Even the helicopters used to infiltrate was covered up by saying they were Blackhawks, when we all saw in the news that the remaining tail rotor was not.  The book is very well written, you can visualize the characters and the setting, with the principal role being that of Mark Owen, the hero \\"leader\\", who stars in his own book.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I did not want this book to end.  I am very much looking forward to the next book.  Keep 'em coming Mr. Follett... please.
B006WQLH7G|5.0|Every thing stays secure. Good control.  Other than an occasional update, you don't know it's running. I would never Trade it.
B000YMQI6E|4.0|It was surprising and the acting was good. Ryan Gosling was much younger in this film, but you can tell that he is going to have a very successful movie career. And Anthony Hopkins is good in everything...lol
0307277887|3.0|After spending two weeks rewatching 60+ hours of the serial killer we love. I was still jonesin' like a crack addicted; God I can't wait for Season 7 to start. So I decided to read [[ASIN:0848833031 Darkly Dreaming Dexter]] the book that inspired the series. I usually don't read the books that inspire television show. With nearly a month between when I finished season 6 episode 12 and season 7 episode 1, my craving would have made me start the series over again.<br /><br />Okay. So when I started I expected a condensed version of the television show. This is not it. For the most part you get the broad strokes of the Dexter season 1 in this novel with several changes. Dexter Morgan seems less principled in the novel than in show. I didn't really like that aspect of the character. His Dark Passenger is also more of an entity than an aspect of his personality. It makes him seem more schizophrenic than psychopathic.<br /><br />Even Deborah seemed less confident and capable in the novel. At least the show writers still managed to bring Deborah's foul mouth. I think that was one of the highlights of this novel. Her foul mouth is a creation of Jeff Lindsay and not the show writers.<br /><br />For the majority of this book it reads like a very condensed first season of the television show. It made for a very boring read. But it does have few twists toward the end that makes it worth the read.<br /><br />There are several differences but two major ones that firmly separated the novel from the series. The death of a character at the end of this book; along with Debs discover of Dexter's secret. It changes the dynamic of the novels going forward. Debs discovery is just now only being address whereas the novels has five or six more books to deal with this complication in Dexter's life.<br /><br />After reading this novel I'm less in enthused to read the next novel but at some point I will finish the series. As I sit here and write I'm starting to ask questions that weren't addressed. Some come from the differences in the novel and series and others come from the novel itself.<br /><br />I recommend this novel to those dedicated fans that love Dexter. Casual fans may not appreciate the differences between the two. I know that the novels came first and I still don't like some of the differences, they enriched the characters.
B008JH5CVS|2.0|Guy Pearce tries his best to elevate this movie beyond its mediocre script, but no one else seems to care. The result is a high concept movie with bland execution and it just isn't fun.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I was intrigued by the amount of 5 star reviews for this book, and with the super low price I wasn't worried about giving it a try.  Even with the high expectations I had from seeing the over 90 percent 5 star reviews, I was still surprised by how clever and entertaining this book series is.  The first of the 5 in the series, however, was absolutely the best. Extremely well done, with many twists for such a short story. In short, buy the series, its worth your time and money.
B006BGZJJ4|1.0|This product was defective and didn't charge my Kindle fire! What a waste of money on this item! Boo! I am not a happy camper!
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|I finished The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry the other day and loved it.  This is a story that is funny, touching and thought provoking.  It made me think about my relationship with my Father and with my Son.  I am about the same age as Harold and I can relate to his need to resolve some issues that he has ignored for years.  My wife has just finished the book and she enjoyed it also.  We have discussed the issues raised by the book and the way the author captured the sense of loss and confusion that we all experience at some time in our lives.<br /><br />Rachel Joyce has written a great first book and I can't wait to see what she writes next.
B002I9Z8G2|5.0|I had this on regular DVD, on my 60inch TV it kinda sucked.  I bought the blue ray, It was AWESOME, wow, what a difference. The sound was great also through my sound bar. The graphics were so much better. I'm so glad I bought it, I also bought it used. It works great. Best Star trek movie ever.
B000N2HCM4|2.0|I read this in an effort to see inside Obama, try to understand him better. When I was done, I didn't feel I understood him any better. To say that Obama is preoccupied on the subject of \\"power\\" is, I feel, quite an understatement. Often negative, I couldn't understand how someone seeking power (eventually the Presidency), could be so negative about it. The other recurring subject was about race. Again, a mixed bag. Finally, as written it reads more like The Life of Barrack Obama than about Dreams From My Father.<br /><br />Throughout the book, I kept wondering how anyone so young could be so analytical, so philosophical about life, their roots, where they belong, and on and on. At this point, I don't buy it. What I truly think is that more than an autobiography, it is political positioning!<br /><br />Repeatedly throughout the book, something that happened was presented in story form, followed immediately by Obama's reaction/thoughts on issues underlying the story. Not reactions or thoughts as an adult, but at the time they happened.<br /><br />\\"black\\"! Anyone with an ounce of honesty and an IQ above 3 knows that \\"blacks\\" have gone through hell to get where they are today! But not everyone \\"black\\" has history. Obama never had to deal with racism first hand. This book makes it obvious that first and foremost, he considers himself an African American with Kenyan (actually Luo) heritage. Could he be after \\"the black votes\\"? His book reflects a young man who often discusses \\"black\\" issues with his friends. His friends saw him far more concerned about his weight.<br /><br />It is understandable why Barack devoted few details of his dad due to their nature. A book about Obama, Sr. might well be entitled \\"A Fallen Star\\". In short, highly intelligent, a Harvard education, all throw away by stubborness, arrogance, and a dream. The dream - to have the recently independent Kenya governed by a SOCIALISTIC REGIME.

B005LAIH4A|4.0|Thneed-ville has everything you need, so you don't have to leave the city for any reason. There are no real trees left, but you can buy trees that turn on by remote control and then select which season you want for the tree, and it only uses 96 batteries. Why, you can even buy fresh air. Well, actually you will need to, but you are in luck because they sell that too!<br /><br />The Lorax is about consumerism and the need for conservation. Achieving a good balance is essential for the survival of all beings on our planet. The short, orange Lorax speaks for the trees. In the movie, the young and successful entrepeneur called Once-ler gets carried away and chops them all down. When he is older, he realizes where he went wrong. Sadly, trees have gone the way of the dinosaurs and are only the stuff of daydreams. Yet, hope is found in a seed.
B002WNC5BU|4.0|I didn't expect a concert film and am glad it was much more than that.  I've been around for a few decades: loved the work of these guys when they first came on the scene and admired they way they have evolved.  To have all three together was an inspired idea.  Well worth a view by anyone who was, and is,  influenced by blues-based rock and its derivations.  I need to single out Jack White because he is the newest of the three: creative, committed, talented.
B003B96AOW|4.0|This figure is pretty cool. Only have a few minor issues. First, I don't know if it was just a factory defect or something but the hand and leg joints on my particular figure are kind of loose. This is weird because I purchased this item brand new.<br />Second the Diamond Select toys are a little bit bigger than the standard Marvel Hasbro or Toy Biz Marvel Legends toys by an inch or two. Where these action figures are about 6 inches the Deadpool has to be about 7 to 8 inches. Now this isn't too bad, but just note of you are a collector the Diamond Select figures can tower over the standard ones. Oh and for some reason there legs aren't very pose-able.<br /><br />As far as the figure itself. Pretty cool. Comes with twin handguns that you can put in the leg holsters, two sais, a machine gun, and two katana blades which you can store in the figures back sheaths. The figure is armed to the teeth like the comic book counterpart would be.

055310277X|5.0|A riveting, heart-breaking and blood-boiling account of the colonization of the Americas and the genocide of Indigenous People and their cultures required to achieve it.  Reading every empty promise, broken treaty and manipulation by the white man towards Native people paints a very simple template of how the white culture achieved its dominance over and over again.  Each story breaks the heart a little more as the reader wonders how the predatory, parasitic eurowestern race came to be created and differ so radically from Indigenous races across the world, and even more baffling, came to think & promote itself \\"civilized\\" or superior to Indigenous Nations in any way, when the reality is the very opposite.<br /><br />If no other history ('his stories') is taught in schools, this book should be the only required reading for it tells the clearest account of how the Americas were \\"developed\\", and any other \\"developing/developed\\" (colonized) nation, for that matter.<br /><br />If Europe's colonization across the globe (known as globalization today) does not enrage you already, this book will help that process, and it will begin the necessary global imperative of DE-colonization, or as Native American artist and activist John Trudell puts it, un-mining our mined minds.  For those of us living on stolen Native land anywhere in the world, we MUST de-colonize; we owe it to the human race of the past, present, and future.

B000PY6BBI|5.0|I loved this film! Ladyhawke is probably one of my favorite movies. I think I first watched this on TV during the 1990's but not sure.<br /><br />Several critics mention that the film score by Alan Parsons is a bit misplaced in this film set in the middle ages. I suspect the background music may be the very reason I liked the film so much. As any young man of the time, I'm a Pink Floyd and Alan Parson's fan. Maybe that's one reason I liked the film so much. Ladyhawke was nominated for an Oscar in the category of sound effects. Those horses clomping around sounded so real. I bet they were!<br /><br />I suspect this film may be based on a true story. . . I held a friendship once with someone who was living in the Philippines - and just as I would wake up in the morning they were going to bed. We were two souls who couldn't meet. The feeling reminded me of this film. I suspect the author, Edward Khmara, may have ties to India or Malaysia and may have been writing about what he knew. A true story, so to speak.<br /><br />I gotta admit (spoiler alert) I didn't really like the ending much. Or rather the ending after the ending. It seemed kinda unnecessary, having the Bishop try and stab the beautiful maiden at the very end of the film, to try and keep the lovers apart, apparently. You think the Bishop would be used to the idea of not getting the girl after that much time had passed.
0525952616|4.0|Having been introduced to the sci-fi genre by Michael Crichton books such as \\"The Sphere\\" and \\"Andromeda Strain\\", my expectations were high. Daniel Suarez is almost as effective in his use of technology to enrich his plot; however he sometimes digresses into a few paragraphs of dense tech explanation in a chapter that otherwise moves along smoothly. While their styles may differ, Daniel Suarez has created a believable, exciting sci-fi thriller that will satisfy fans of Crichton books.

B004LWZW4W|4.0|Spoilers Below. . .<br /><br />Rise of the Planet of the apes is a loving prequel to the earlier Planet of the Apes series. It's not what you expect of a 'blockbuster' movie. There's some action (very effectively done) but the film is not driven by action. For the most part, this film somehow avoids the racial allusions made in the earlier literary and celluloid versions of Planet of the Apes. It's a great film none-the-less. Be sure and stay till the very end of the film!<br /><br />It's a perfect prequel. On a television playing in the background, you hear about man's 'first mission to mars' launching. Later in the film you realize these must be the three astronauts who come back to 'earth' in the first Planet of the Apes film. It's a subtle allusion. It doesn't fully make sense till the end of the film - wonderfully done. It did bother me a little, because I've never seen the very beginning of the first movie. Even seeing it 3 times on television perhaps (the first time during the 1970's) the earliest I remember tuning is was with the original astronauts crashed in the water wondering what year it is - as if they had traveled in time - and they also did not know they were back on earth. It was only a small thing. It made for one tiny loose-end as far as I was concerned in a very well done film. The way the Apes take over makes much more sense going by the story told in this film, plus it plays into the fears we have in this day and age. The film stuck to it's strengths. It's not as if the film has great insights into 'human' nature, or as if it is about the development of Caeser's character, but it sticks to Caeser's story.<br /><br />There is a huge problem in the film, however, and so I deduct one star at least. At the beginning of the film the young protagonist desperately wants to continue experimenting on a new drug that raises the intelligence of monkeys. His corporate sponsor's say no - in a show of amazing stupidity (for all we know a violent reaction Is the intelligent response to being a fated lab animal). Later in the movie these same corporate sponsor's want to continue experimenting, no matter what, and the young scientist doesn't agree and even quits his job rather than continue experimenting. Without greater explanation (and it would have taken quite a lot) the turnaround (and both scenes) just seemed like very stupid passages in an otherwise great film. I suspect the film was reverse engineered. The young scientist, well, he's the star, so he has to be a good guy. So he provides a warning of sorts to make him a good guy. Caesar is a protagonist too, so he's a good 'guy' also. Perhaps he's a good guy because he's educated and has good parents. It doesn't hurt that he happens to be a main character in the film. I do feel this is a great film, anyway.the intelligent response to being a fated lab animal).

B000V5W8Q8|5.0|Odo's character is really fleshed out in this episode. I greatly enjoyed watching this episode, because Odo is the most memorable character in this series. Being the only shapeshifter on DS9 and apparently in the entire quadrant, he knew nothing of his origins, but here comes a murdering thief to tell him he is a changeling and hand him valid proof of the existence of his species.  From this episode onward, Odo knows that he is not the only one of his kind.

0307951529|3.0|First, I want to say that I enjoyed this book a great deal. I finished it instead of losing interest halfway through, so that says a lot about Chris as a writer. He made the topic enjoyable and exciting.<br /><br />That said, when I finished $100 Startup, I felt like I'd missed something. I went back through the notes that I'd jotted down throughout the pages, and over and over again I'd written the word HOW?? with a line underneath it, signifying that the author hadn't given enough information. How exactly did business owner A accomplish task B? How exactly did person X find their way out of situation Y? There were a lot of places where there needed to be more information, especially if the point of the book is to inform potential entrepreneurs that might face a similar situation as was being described.<br /><br />I was also left feeling like there should have been more details about a few of the businesses Chris discusses, as I found myself more than once putting the book down and looking up the name he mentions to find out exactly what he was talking about. It was a bit of a distraction that could have been avoided by giving an additional sentence where he vaguely mentions a person's business *type*, but doesn't explain exactly what it is they do.<br /><br />Towards the end, I felt like the book ran out of steam. The chapter on franchising yourself felt disjointed, like it was a conglomerate of a few other half-written chapters that didn't quite come together in the final edit. That could be the editor's issue, but still, the book was affected. The last chapter didn't really accomplish the task of pulling everything together; rather, it limply dangled on the end as if asking, \\"What are you going to do with all that you've just read?\\" Where's the excitement building? The GET OUT THERE AND GET TO IT feeling? Chris had done such a good job of this throughout the book, but the end wasn't terribly inspiring.<br /><br />The final thing that bummed me out is that there were a few areas of the book where I wanted more information, and when I went to the 100startup.com website, there wasn't much there. I was funneled into Chris' site, where I learned he's more than happy to sell you one of his products that contains all the stuff that didn't end up in the book for hundreds of dollars. (yes, really - like $150-over $400. Yikes!) I was surprised to see that he'd reserved some of the most informative stuff for his own private products - something I'm surprised his editors were ok with. Like, how exactly does one set the value on their products? The book doesn't say - it just recommends business owners set a price based on the product's value, not what it cost you to make it. Ok, well, where's the information that tells you how to gauge value? It's sort of ironic that I'd have to pay a couple hundred bucks to find out more about what to price my own products at.<br /><br />So, read the first 3/4 this book because it's a fun read and you'll get some good details, but if you want to go the distance with Chris, plan on shelling out a few hundred bucks.were a few areas of the book where I wanted more information, and when I went to the 100startup.com website, there wasn't much there.

0525953728|5.0|Read No Easy Day - It's clear that Bush is the reason that they caught/killed UBL & Co. The trail started at Gitmo, went through Khalid Sheik Mohammed and broke with a lucky/dumb call by UBL's courier, who the Bush people patiently tailed for years (when they could have grabbed him at any time) - The only \\"decision\\" Obama made was to shoot him or leave a bomb crater. I am all the more impresses by how the Bush people handled themselves after the raid now, when they clearly could have claimed credit.<br /><br />I guess that is why the DNC Platform quietly reverses the \\"promise\\" to close Gitmo. What did Clint say the other day about \\"an idiot\\"?<br /><br />The book also shows how screwed up things are in Afghanistan now. Over-lawyered and PR focussed. The team had to sneak in country to avoid 'our side' screwing it up.<br /><br />I look forward to the movie that shows the whole story, starting on Sept 11th, rather that the current picture that tries to show this as a 1-night no-knock raid by the new sherriff in town.

B005LAIIRQ|4.0|`The Grey' isn't usually my kind of movie, but after hearing nothing but good things about it, I gave it a watch and I wasn't disappointed. It's actually quite a suspenseful survival-thriller and I loved it from the first minute to when the credits started rolling.<br /><br />Liam Neeson is John Ottway, a hunter working on an Alaskan drilling station who keeps the wolves away with his trusty rifle. On his flight home, his plane crashes in the middle of nowhere with just him and a handful of survivors, as they try and make their way to people, they find themselves under siege by wolves while battling it out with the cold weather and injuries.<br /><br />Director Joe Carnahan knows how to keep things edgy, he uses the thick darkness of night and the low visibility of the blizzard to great effect; in one scene, the wolves let out a terrifying howl in response to Ottway's challenge and all we can see are their cold breaths and we never know when one, or several, are going to jump out and maul one of the survivor's to death. And it helps that they also give the wolves an almost eerily human quality; they take revenge for the fallen, they send pack outcasts to test the group, they use tactics...you get the feeling that Ottway and co. aren't just facing a pack of wild, mongrel wolves, they're facing an organized and formidable enemy. The dangers don't just come from the wolves, the weather, the injuries and the dangerous terrain the group traverse only serve to make their situation that much more dire.<br /><br />But it's not all action and I'm thankful that Carnahan also had the mind to take time out to build the characters, give us insight into their pasts and their relationships with each other and to get you emotionally connected to them, especially John Ottway. It really made their deaths that much more painful to watch in the end, especially further into the movie, where the remaining guys had already been through so much, a few of the deaths might even make you a little misty. Along the way you get a little exploration of death, faith, God and courage to give you a little food for thought, necessary or not, it does give the film some appreciated depth. `The Grey' is worth the watch.

030758836X|4.0|What impressed me the most about Gone Girl was Gillian Flynn's intelligent and skillful writing. As a reader, I was lead one way and then the path would change and my opinion would change. I never knew where the story was going. Although it was a dark story, it held my interest and I read the book fast. Several times had to stop myself from looking ahead. I did murmur aloud several times that the two main characters deserved each other. The ending did not disappoint because it went along with the twisting and changing story. Would I have liked it to be a different ending,the answer is yes. However, it did not surprise me.

B005LAJ16I|5.0|Addendum to review on night after the Emmys: Mandy Patinkin was strangely missed. He was a prime basic character. His scenes with Clare Danes were some of the best chemistry in the show and I loved watching them. Can't fathom his being overlooked; hopefully next time.<br /><br />Absorbing  narrative. Good acting and directing. Lewis does a goodjob of playing ambiguous as he keeps us guessing about his real aims.<br /><br />I was distracted by an error with set design in Brody's family's house: the back of a couch, facing away from the open-space kitchen/living room, is about six inches from the burners of a stove. No one would live with the tops of the heads of people vulnerable to spattering grease or the potential mishap of a tilting, boiling pot. No one ever sits on the couch. (As why would they?)<br />(Clare Danes') apartment has an enticing view of an outdoor patio, but she never sits there. Where does it lead? Is it on the first floor? What kind of building is it?<br />The Brody house's front door looks as flimsy as that of a cheap inner door of a cheap apartment pr hotel door. More attention could be paid to buildings and contexts of buildings. Esp. for those of us unfamiliar with D.C. living<br /><br />All actors excllent. Boy Issa excellent. Brody children excellent.
B005LAJ22Q|3.0|I just finished watching the complete Second Season. Season One was interesting. I liked it. I couldn't wait to watch season 2, then I saw disc 1 of season 2 and quickly became disappointed. That disc dragged on into nothing. Nothing really began until Disc 2, and by then I had lost interest, but watched the next discs anyway.<br />Overall, season two is full of action, yet it is also full of stupidity: the blind leading the blind, which turned me off immediately. I can't stand to watch stupidity. For me, this is the last season I will watch. I'll wait until the show ends and then read about what happens. Of course, that is just my opinion, but watching a tv show where stupid people continually do stupid things led by an even dumber person is not my choice for entertainment. It is a miracle called Hollywood and scripts that even keep these characters and this thing going. Realistically though, just how long can they keep this show going? Enough with the zombies already.

B0016YBFZ8|1.0|Item I purchased was a gift, sent it off, then found out it stopped in the middle and there was nothing after that. Replaced it at a local major store.
0374203032|2.0|I first read a review of this book in The Economist.  It noted \\"Anyone who sets store by capitalism and markets will find [this book] uncomfortable reading. [It] should be read all the same.\\"  Ok, I'm one of those kind of people and like to be challenged.  So far so good.  Unfortunately, the author lost me in the introduction.  He attributes the financial crisis of 2008 as a market failure and takes off from there.  At the end of the introduction, he says:  \\"When we think of the morality of the markets, we think first of Wall Street banks and their reckless misdeeds....\\"  No mention of all of the market distortions from the artificial low interest rates imposed by the Federal Reserve to the almost monopolistic actions of the 2 big GSEs:  Fannie & Freddie, to various incentives by the US tax code & other regulations to over-borrow for housing to the mysterious capital requirements discrepancies imposed first by the SEC and later Basel II to finally the massive bailouts of financial institutions all over the world that confirmed to big institutions that lending prudence is not really necessary.  OK, lots of folks are unwilling to acknowledge these market distortions and instead focus on a small piece of \\"deregulation\\" in the form of the Gramm-Leach-Billey repeal of Glass-Steagall.  I'll forgive the author on that one but I'll remain skeptical.<br /><br />From that foundation, the author launches into a series of anecdotes that are intended to show that markets can produce \\"immoral\\" outcomes or something.  In the first chapter, he rails on how terrible it is when people pay other people to stand in line for them without acknowledging the market distortions that create those lines in the first place. (That said, to the author's credit, he does a reasonably thorough job of explaining the different dynamics and perspectives on this topic.)  In the next chapter, he rails on how terrible it is that people are offered cash to get sterilized, to get good grades,  to lose weight, etc. without acknowledging the market distortions of government dictated health insurance, government run schools, etc.  Then he includes a strange chapter on hiring friends, paying for apologies, why people resist giving cash gifts, etc.  The next chapter focuses on the \\"horrors\\" of the life settlement industry where people with terminal diseases ell their life insurance policies to strangers for upfront cash so that they can enjoy their final days without acknowledging that the life insurance industry's primary foundation is it's favorable tax treatment.  In the final chapter, he complains about how money has infiltrated into organized sports (and other public activities) in terms naming rights, luxury skyboxes, and other kinds of advertising.  He seems to miss his youth when baseball tickets were $1.50 and owners exploited their federal exemption from antitrust laws to underpay their players.<br /><br />I ended up skimming the book in an evening.  There were a few slightly interesting anecdotes but overall this felt like a bunch of personal complaints about economic activities that irritate the author.  Does my bias shine through?
0446547646|2.0|This will be my last Nicholas Spark's novel.  I just can't do it anymore.

What's wrong with a truly happy ending?  And ghosts?  Seriously?

0307454541|4.0|As you read the other reviews, you'll see that I don't have anything profound to add; however, I had been fairly warned when I was about to read this book by three different bookie friends that this book is INVOLVED.  There are many characters, but you are reminded very early on who the important ones are.  If you don't know much about Swedish geography, try not to let it bother you.  I didn't, and it didn't take away from the reading.  Larsson describes the scenes as you need to know them.<br /><br />The only other thing is the violence against women.  The original title is called, \\"The Man Who Hated Women\\" and it is graphic in some areas, but it wasn't too much for me to handle.  If you are sensitive to this, you may want to skip the read.<br /><br />I am eager to see the film and read the remaining two books in the series.

I couldn't obtain any evidence that there were any  Lessons Learned' in this incredible experience. In spite of his service and commendable record as a sniper, I am simply not interested in reading a narcissistic account of how great 'One' is.<br /><br />Sounds like the book should have been titled 'I', 'Me', or 'I'm great!' At any rate he doesn't strike me as a 'Quiet Professional'.<br /><br />The book reviews indicate a poorly written work. Enough said! Again, thanks!

B008MG1E4A|5.0|I am a former Army Soldier. I served in the 82nd Airborne, and a few other units. I was never High Speed or Special Ops, and this book is awesome. The people that give it a bad reviews seem to have their own axe to pick. When the POTUS uses something to get himself reelected, and then Washington leaks so much BS about an even, it takes people that had boots on the ground to stand up and to shed light on the event.<br /><br />The author did a fantastic job, he gave away zero OPSEC, and hell, we all knew that wasnt an MH-60 that flew those SEALs into the compound, they are calling them GhostHawks and he didnt even talk about that! If you saw the photo and you know anything about the UH-60 airframe, then you know that that wasnt one. Another thing, I would be surprised if the guys flying it were not even from 106th SOAR, we all know they were from the other unit in VA.

When I updated my unclassified resume a few months ago, I ran it through prepublication review with the folks I work for now.  The NDA signed by Mr. Bissonnette was extremely clear on what is required of him if he were ever to publish a piece that mentions his work.  I consider him a criminal.
0525953728|5.0|A great read.  Exceptionally well written.  Last 100 pages fast paced and exciting.  The truth needed to be told.  Interesting how these things get done.  Clear that great risk and, therefore, great courage is involved.  Great skill and training too.<br /><br />One star reviewers lose this one. It's going to be around a long time and get the recognition it deserves.  Many of the one stars probably come from people who are fans of Obama or disagree with breaking the code.  The Seals weren't fans of Obama.  The code was shredded by others, opening the door to setting the record straight.<br /><br />Read this book and \\"Leading from Behind\\" to figure who really deserves the credit for this exploit.<br /><br />Books like this create respect and gratitude for those brave souls who protect our freedoms.
0345803485|1.0|I  was excited to read these books due to all the hype. But to be honest after reading the whole trilogy I have got to ask where they hype came from. I did not find the first book interesting at all but decided to really give it a shot and read all three. It was like reading the same awful book three times in a row.<br /><br />1) Characters:<br />The characters are uninteresting and boring. They are taken directly from twilight but made worse. It was almost laughable how much the characters were like their twilight counterparts. But on top of that the hero is abusive. I am not sure why anyone would find him a heart throb. The heroine is a wimp.<br /><br />2) Plot<br />There is none. Simple as that. I will admit in the second and third books there is a bit more plot but in the first book there is absolutely no plot at all.<br /><br />3) Sex<br />While I admit the first couple of sex scenes were kind of fun by the end of the first book I was so tired of reading them they just got plain boring. It was the same sex scene over and over again with just a small twist. But they became predictable. The reader knew exactly what would happen, what would he say, what would she say etc... and this does not change for three books. Not to mention the characters have sex like 5 times a day every day. I was begging for them to stop having sex and have a plot but this does not happen. (If I ever hear the phrase inner goddess again...)<br /><br />I honestly could not recommend this book or book series to anyone. There was nothing interesting. Please save your time and $ if you plan on buying these. At least I got mine from the library but that doesn't help the fact that I wasted so much time reading these books.

B004XN3FHA|5.0|I got this light from Lapolicegear not here.  The version I recieved was the newer 860 lumens not the 800 lumens(The lowest setting is the kicker.. 15L over 10L).<br /><br />The light was going to get 4 stars due to the rattle from the battery compartment, but it was easily fixe with a small strip of duct tape wrapped around the top portion of the Battery compartment(yep 1 more use for duct tape ;)  ).<br /><br />After my mod, the TK41 feels solid and is very well constructed. I really like the switches as they are much easier to use than on the rear like other lights.  The light is very bright so don't blind your Dog or Cat(please).  feels great in my hand and seems well balanced.  The memory function is great as it will remember the last settings.<br /><br />The only negative was the rattle, but was easily fixed with duct tape. I will be getting some more enloop rechargeable batteries as they are the best I have ever used!!

B0089J29C6|4.0|Betty Grable, who had been Hollywood's number one female star for 10 consecutive years, was turning her crown over to Marilyn Monroe when \\"How to Marry a Millionaire\\" was released in 1953.  Both gals, along with Lauren Bacall, are at their comedic best in one of the wittiest and most fun comedies of the 1950s.  Add to the mix urbane William Powell, handsome Rory Calhoun, everyman David Wayne, and oh-so suave Cameron Mitchell, and you've got the makings of a lightweight but delightful story line.  All three ladies \\"settle\\" for love and only one unexpectedly snags her millionaire.  But the fun is in the hunt, and these three gorgeous dolls know how to hunt!
B005LAIHPY|1.0|The story was nearly as bad as the acting.  This movie could have really been good.  The chezzy stuff Hollywood puts in this movie is really pathetic.  We were disappointed with this.  Glad we only rented it.  Felt like I was watching a show for 10 year olds, sort of like Super friends, or the old TV Batman.  Pick another.
B0035JLVWY|5.0|It is an awesome, spell-bounding, movie!  It gets you from the very beginning to the very last minute.  One of the best movies and the best endings I have ever seen.  I have watched it THREE times- it is one of my top movies of all times!!!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is great because it is very fun. At first you dont think its fun but as the levels go on they get harder and the more you want to solve them. The diffrent colors are good to spot the design and to locate its twin. I also enjoy this game because of the fourth of math. Math IS my favrite subject and i like solving puzzles. If u like or struggle with math this is a very &quot;smart &quot; thing to play. - from snowball123456789000
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book avoided the saccharine factor.  Considering the subject, that is something.  The way the kids behaved in this book was so realistic that I had to put this book down at times. Another YA book that completely won me over.

B000GDH9JQ|5.0|This movie is excellent! I was very happy with the prompt delivery my movie was delivered. It was brand new just like the seller said. Baryshnikov and Hines are very entertaining to watch. Semi biographical for Baryshnikov who also defected from Russia to America. All fans of dance should add this movie to their collection.

B008RJ6TTC|5.0|Well, I am a bit confused now. The number of discs listed is only 8, but the actual number should have been 34 pieces, right ? For a complete series, the latter number looks more logical to me. Anyone to confirm this ?
B006M7JCC2|4.0|Anita Moorjani shares with her readers a true and powerful history of her own experience that leads us all to reflect on our own lives and attitudes. It is a great life-lesson and I've share my impressions with many of my friends.<br />An important sentence by her in this book: \\"It was then that I understood that my body is only a reflection of my internal state. If my inner self were aware of its greatness and connection with All-that-is, my body would soon reflect that and heal rapidly\\". This is so true, we should spread it to all human beings!
B001UV4XIS|2.0|But the actual DVD skipped multiple times and some parts of the movie had audio that did that not match the picture. Very bad. Very disappointed. Two stars because I was able to watch the film on digital.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|I read this book (as well as the other two) over the duration of a weekend. I found them to be interesting and an easy read. There are certainly aspects of the book that are unrealistic; but it's called FICTION for a reason. The comparison I would make is when you go to certain movies, you know going in not to look too deeply at some of the back story because you will find holes in the plot - the same applies here on multiple levels.<br /><br />That being said, I found the dynamic of Ana and Christian to be interesting; neither having previously had a \\"normal\\" relationship, they had to figure it out as they went and of course made mistakes along the way. Haven't we all in our relationships? I think most of us can relate to the lust that exists in a new relationship when everything is new, different and exciting.<br /><br />Christian finally finds a reason worth facing the demons of his childhood while Ana has to be patient and understanding while trying not to lose sight of who she is in the process.<br /><br />And at the end of the day, don't most women feel the need to \\"fix\\" wounded people? And don't we fantasize about being swept off our feet by someone who is gorgeous and wealthy?<br /><br />Again, there are holes in the plot and aspects that are unrealistic - but focus on the dynamics of the relationship, attraction, lust, love, forgiveness, etc. and I think you will find a story worth reading more than once.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Although I'm familiar with Stephen King's writing style, this was actually my first Stephen King book. I've only seen the movies. I was getting caught in a \\"genre rut,\\" so I decided to branch out and give this one a go. This is the perfect mix between fact and fiction, and there are definitely no conspiracy theory tendencies, which go hand-in-hand with the Kennedy assassination.<br />  With time travel comes the \\"butterfly effect.\\" You can't change the past without changing the future. Mr. King proves this with 11/22/63. What would the world be like today if Jack Kennedy had survived Lee Harvey Oswald's assassination attempt? While Jake Epping's goal is to prevent the death of the president, there are so many more stories happening at the same time, including a bit of a love story between our main character and the clumsy Sadie Dunhill. King keeps it all moving in his own style, proving that the past does not want to be changed.<br />  This book went so much deeper for me than saving a doomed president. It gives new meaning to the saying \\"everything happens for a reason.\\"
0091940737|2.0|The antics of the adolescent female (British, in this case), who is also becoming a young woman, learning her way through all the mysteries and miseries of  growing up provide lively reading.  Despite the teaching of generations of parents and middle school teachers, the use of foul language doesn't trouble her, and after a while it becomes totally lacking in shock value.<br />The change in the book and the girl comes about when she discovers Germaine Greer and feminism.  The mood changes and becomes serious, with occasional lapses, as she considers the meaning of feminism, and moves rapidly into woman's place in the workplace and the world.  However, it all wears thin as the book wears on--and really, in my view, becomes unutterably boring.  (It reminds me of my reaction to Shades of Grey: boring, boring, boring.)<br />The British reviewers evidently liked it; perhaps you will too.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Really enjoyed this book-it kept me guessing the whole time and the ending was not what I expected.  Plan to read more Gillian Flynn books.
B007KOYEOC|5.0|*And the crowd goes wild* Take a bow Ms James. You have done it again! You have made it to the absolute top of my list. The Fifty Shades books are going down in history as my #1 favorite of all time - Congratulations to you!<br /><br />I am lost for words, I don't really know where to begin. I loved the first book Fifty Shades of Grey, but felt uncomfortable at times for Ana, sweet, innocent, caring Ana, being pushed around and manipulated. A contract? What the? My heart broke for her page and page again. I love love loved (note the extra loves :D) the second book Fifty Shades Darker and was dumbfounded and astonished at the changes Ana & Christians relationship went through, and just completed the third book Fifty Shades Free, I am finally sated - It is the bees knees, the absolute of romance, and the book that makes my world spin. I tried to drag this book out, for as long as humanly possible, because it gave me warm fuzzys. It covered everything I wanted for Mr & Mrs Grey and for that I am so grateful. It spoke to me on so many different levels. I adore all the emotions, and talking and expressing and seeing them interact with each other in every way a true relationship requires - all the true trials and tribulations of married life. The bedroom, bathroom, kitchen, loungeroom, car parts (if you get what I mean :P), those bits just left me feeling dissatisfied and in search of my own hubby. Man, has that boy got the moves? Whoa...<br /><br />I have a final few words to say to my dearest friends;<br /><br />Christian...my darling, Christian. I will love you for the rest of my days. What a multi-multi faceted, astonishing, swoon worthy character. I feel like you must be based on a true person, because the world would be a place place for not having you in it. Thankyou for being Fifty Shades, You have shown me the world through your eyes and I thankyou for that. I will remember you forever.<br /><br />Ana...You light up my, I mean Christians world. Without you, therewould be no Christian, you have definitely made him what he is today. Without you, he is only a shadow. I think everyone loses a bit of themselves after they marry, maybe it's the whole \\"I promise to obey thing\\" but you have just gone from strength to strength. I am wrapt that you finally understand and grasp your power. Your unconditional love, and persistence are qualities that a lot of people lack, without those, and your quick thinking & the ways you express yourself so fluently making Christian hear you, these books would not be the note worthiest of note worthy. Thankyou for being you.<br /><br />Ms James. I am forever grateful to have Christian and Ana to fall back on in times of my physical and emotional need. I will forever buy whatever you write. Your way with words and emotions delight me. Thankyou for being you.
B008KL2ITW|3.0|I couldn't put this down, but that was mostly due to being unable to look away from the carnage of the central relationship in this book, much like Ana's and Christian's from Fifty Shades.<br />Two college students sleep in the same bed each night, and Abby is totally okay with her bed buddy screwing two girls on the couch outside while she listens. WTF? I wanted to scream at her to have some self respect. I didn't like Abby, at all. Much preferred her best friend, America.<br />All that being said, I read through it in one day so it must have done something right.
B00846REIS|5.0|Great book, couldn't put it down! Wanted something to read after Fifty Shades Trilogy. Gideon is amazing! Can't wait for next book to come out!

This book was cheesy, unrealistic, and badly written.  I completely agree with others that have said the subject matter is scary.  Look at all the 5 star reviews this book has gotten! Over-the-top jealousy and physical violence is okay as long as you're in love, right?  Give me a break.

0765316994|5.0|You need only know two things to sum up my thoughts on Redshirts by John Scalzi: while listening to the book, I laughed out loud and I cried. I don't often cry when reading books. The last time was the seventh Harry Potter book, but I expected to when I cracked that book. When I cued up the audiobook of Redshirts, I didn't even see it coming, which is, to be honest, better. So, if you want to stop reading this review right now, go ahead. If you want more details, read on.<br /><br />Redshirts is John Scalzi's parody/love letter to Star Trek. After a funny yet unexpected prologue, the novel introduces Ensign Andrew Dahl, newly assigned to the starship Intrepid, the flagship of the Universal Union. (Think Enterprise) Dahl and his new group of friends start to get accustomed to their new duties and lives aboard the Intrepid but the seasoned crew members all act weird. It soon becomes apparent that the members of the Away Missions (off the ship for you non-Trekkies) always seem to face some heretofore alien presence. Said alien almost always inflicts bodily injury or death to a member of the away team, yet the senior command staff never suffer any harm. It's as if the lower staff members are jinxed to die if they go on the missions.<br /><br />To put this in context of Star Trek, let me explain. In just about every single episode, Captain Kirk, First Officer Spock, Doctor McCoy, and some member of the the crew, nameless until the first commercial break, wearing a red shirt, perishes. For the rest of the episode, the lead characters emote over the death, emerge victorious by the end, and live to trek on another day. If you ever wondered what it was like to be a member of the Enterprise crew who didn't have a job on the bridge, this is your book.<br /><br />Where Scalzi provides the bulk of his humor, early on, is in the myriad ways the crew employ to avoid going on an away mission. Naturally, Dahl gets himself assigned to one and, while he is injured quite badly, he survives. The other crew member does not. As a long-time fan of Trek, I was laughing at all the obvious references to actions done in a 1960s-era television show for dramatic purposes and what really might have happened were all this stuff real. Wil Wheaton, who played Wesley Crusher in Star Trek: The Next Generation, provides the narration with just enough snark to truly bring out the best in Scalzi's prose. He reads the boisterous captain's lines with gusto, the science officer's lines with calm precision, and the rest of Dahl's friends with skepticism that borders on incredulity.<br /><br />Now, the story turns on a plot device that I loved. In fact, as a seasoned crew member gathers Dahl and his friends to explain his theory as to why all these occur on Away Missions, I had a thought: what if Scalzi did This Thing? Well, cool as it is, he did. I will not give it away here because I want you to be surprised.<br /><br />The full title of the book is Redshirts: A Novel with Three Codas. In short, these are three epilogues that resolve some of the more human aspects of the story and, for me, these are what gave this book its emotional depth. In the final two codas, I was listening while doing something else which is one of the best reasons to listen to audiobooks. As the second coda wound down, I paused and felt the tears sting my eyes. You know, I thought, if that coda got me this way, I knew I was in for it as soon as I learned the subject of the final coda. I had to get up and walk away from everyone as I listened to the last coda. It got me, and it got me good. It got me so good, in fact, that, later that day, I could barely get through a retelling of the story to my wife without breaking down. Not sure she's ever seen me that way over a book.<br /><br />You know what? I haven't seen myself that way, either. I loved this book, both for the laughter and the tears. It moved me, and isn't that what a great story is supposed to do?

B00005ATZT|4.0|Richard Kimble (Harrison Ford) is convicted of murdering his wife but he is innocent. He escapes from the authorities and instead of fleeing and hiding he sets out to prove his innocence and find the people responsible for his wife's death. He knows that a one armed man was involved and killed his wife; the only problem is how to find him.<br /><br />Everyone thinks Kimble is guilty and all the evidence points to him trying to collect on insurance money. He escapes when other prisoners try to escape. He has no choice as he is convicted to death row. Something is strange about Kimble as when he is escaping he saves the life of one of the guards of the prison bus. True criminals don't behave that way.<br /><br />US Marshalls are called in to capture the escaped prisoners and Marshall Samuel Gerard (Tommy Lee Jones) is the head man in the effort to find Kimble....<br /><br />This is an outstanding movie featuring and all-star cast. This remake of a television series was a smash hit and it is really worth the time and effort to get a copy and watch. Tommy Lee Jones and Harrison Ford just make this movie something special. I really enjoyed the movie and I recommend it to you. It features a great script, excellent actors and the movie is well directed. You can't ask for a more suspenseful movie that is very entertaining.
034580404X|5.0|I was on vacation when the book fell into my lap and so I began to read it.  Became addicted to the story.  Loved it!  As soon as I got back I purchased the triology and couldn't wait to read the remaining two books. I had heard about the book and its erotic content but that is so not the interesting part about it.  The characters are enticing and the story is addicting.  Getting ready to read the triology again.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Very addicting game that I've spent hours playing. I haven't experienced any bugs that some people are talking about and it runs flawlessly on my Galaxy S III. Great fun for a free game.
B000P0J0AG|5.0|A professional and life long criminal, Neil McCauley (Robert De Niro) is planning an armored car robbery and he has formed a crew to work with him in the planning and execution of the plan. Neil steals an ambulance to use as a cover for the robbery. One of his right hand men is Chris Shiherlis (Val Kilmer) who is assigned the task of buying the explosives for the job. One hotshot on the team kills a guard and as a result the men kill all of the guards.<br /><br />The Los Angeles Police Department is in charge of the investigation of the robbery and Lieutenant Vincent Hanna (Al Pacino) heads the investigation. The robbers took bearer bonds worth over 1.6 million dollars. Hanna realizes the the men were top notch professionals who had a plan, a schedule, and knew how to use high-tech shaped bombs.....<br /><br />This is a movie that is extremely well written and an intellectual film. This is what happens when a smart cop meets a smart career criminal and they face off across the opposite sides of the law. Both men have a lot in common with disrupted and chaotic personal lives.<br /><br />The cast in this movie is simply outstanding and they play their roles to perfection. Not only are the male actors in the movie are the best, so are the women with Diane Venora, Amy Brenneman and Ashley Judd playing key roles. If you love suspenseful and well done movies with a great plot then this film is the one you want to see. I loved this movie and I recommend it to you.
B007EW9ISM|4.0|I'm not sure that there is a perfect stylus out there but this one is very good.  The size of the stylus is great because it is very wide but the tip provides for very precise writing.  There is a slight delay from screen touch to actual writing.  Overall, this is the best stylus that I know of and would recommend to anyone.

B007IXWL2C|5.0|I read all three \\"50 Shades\\" books and totally enjoyed them all.  The plot was interesting, the twists and turns in the characters enjoyable.  These books have made for some interesting reading and now my Fiancee is reading the first one and she loves it!  Funny enough, I'm a Marine Navigator and work in the Gulf of Mexico, this was recommended to me by a Dive Supervisor working out here, LOL!  His wife TOLD him to read the first \\"50\\" before he came home off of the job we were working on...  By his own admission, he wasn't happy at first being \\"Told\\" to read it, but once he got into it, she never had to remind him once to keep reading it!!!  ;-)
B00701L5XS|5.0|This program allows you to zoom in and out on your knot, slow down the assembly video process, spin the assembly around in a circle- it's just like someone's standing in front of you showing you how to do it.

B002T9H2LA|5.0|This movie is crazy.<br /><br />I love a great Tarrantino movie because they always seem to be 70-85% dialogue and 15-30% action. His villains are totally sadistic.<br /><br />Inglourious Basterds is the best Tarrantino movie I have seen so far, being that it is both split into French and English. I love the characters and how Quentin developed them and the story.<br /><br />Christoph Waltz earned his oscar, because his turn as the Jew Hunter goes right down there in the villainy hall of fame. Eli Roth also did a good job as The Bear Jew and Brad Pitt was great as Aldo the Apache and makes me long to earn my keep by getting my 100 \\"Natzi\\" Scalps.<br />This movie is great fun

B005FISBTO|1.0|The only positive reviews are from people streaming it, not the DVDs.<br />  I too am furious about the 'climatic' season ending that is shown in the showtime promo when the discs start. (cannot be skipped or fast forwarded) Imagine sitting down to watch THE SIXTH SENSE, and the coming attractions show you that Bruce Willis' carechter is really dead the whole movie. IDIOTIC! I am peppering Showtime Corporate with e-mails, phone calls and written letters untill SHOWTIME gives my money back. I'm not holding Amazon responsible. THERE IS NO O-M-G FACTOR in this season like the earler seasons of every episode. The only O-M-G factor in this season, is in the last six seconds of the last episode... that they showed you in the beginning promos already!!!!!
B008XG1X18|3.0|I like the app, but have found it has a tendency to freeze a lot when I first open it. Usually I can close it and reopen it without problems, it's just a little anoying sometimes. Other than that, it's nice to have a mobile version:)
B007L3BMGA|2.0|This book was so well publicised that I had to give it a go myself.  Unfortunately it was immature in it's writing and I was so angered by the main characters 1950's attitude of \\"do whatever the man says\\".  I did finish it but I shall not be buying the 2nd or 3rd books.
0345803485|2.0|I had heard so much about this book from girlfriends and co-workers.  They told me it was scandalous and \\"like a porno.\\"  I guess they haven't been exposed to a whole lot in life.  I wasn't a big fan of the author's excessive use of the term \\"down there\\" to describe the female character's nether region.  It was as if this book was written by an unexperienced teenager.  I wasn't aroused nor was I really entertained - though I admit I did crack up on a few occasions.  I just can't believe how many people are talking about this book.  Borrow this book and use your money on quality writing.
1451648537|5.0|I loved reading this book. I couldn't put it down, I read the whole book within a week and have recommended it to friends and collegues to read it. Other people may think different but  I think the author did a great job. I have always been a fan of Apple products and reading this book really gave me insight as to the progression of Steve Job's projects and personality as well as history with the apple products. I learned alot and can put what I learned from the book to good use in my own personal life. Really a great book in my eyes.

B0084IG8TM|5.0|This movie was good. Really good. I saw it before reading the books. (Trilogy) I was glad because I felt it provided me with good visuals of the capital and a face for Katniss Everdeen. However, the movie does not provide all the info in the books. If you see this movie and like it then I highly recommend reading the books. All THREE of them. You will not 'get' the whole story unless you read all 3. I think Jennifer Lawrence is excellent in her portrayal of Katniss. You can see the emotion in her eyes. The costumes are wonderful and Woody Harrelson says 'sweetheart' like no other. Personally, I feel this movie sets up the rest of the story Suzanne Collins has to tell us. The Hunger games story lays the groundwork of what lies ahead for the people of Panem. Please remember that some things may not make sense. This is for the next 3 movies to tell. Excellent work by the cast, director, special effects and oh those costumes and makeup people......love it.

B007X4ECMI|1.0|This movie had been on my \\"Wish List\\" for a long time. I had high hopes for this as a grand space opera science fiction rescue the Presidents daughter adventure. What i got was a poorly written \\"trapped in a prison with dozens of maniacal inmates\\", very, very little science fiction and virtually no space opera. It was a lot like a Steven Segal movie, lots of martial arts but no story line, no sense of adventure. The trailers you've seen online are the sum total of the very few good parts of the movie. I literally fell asleep watching it. BORING.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|An excellent book.  A great story and superb character development.<br /><br />Mr. Ryan creates a detailed and rich world and populates it with personalities that come alive in the pages.<br /><br />I'm looking forward to book II.<br /><br />Bravo!
B0059XTTW8|1.0|This is clearly not a movie for everyone, judging by the disparate reviews seen here.  As much as I enjoy a good spy film, this one for me was just too dark, too slow, too all over the place, too many characters to track, but mostly, I just didn't care who was the mole.  I wasn't shocked by the identity of the mole and didn't even care that there was a mole!<br /><br />I can appreciate that people were able to enjoy the film; I just wasn't one of them!  It's one of those films that you have to watch for yourself to judge, instead of relying on the opinions of others.
B008LY9AWG|5.0|Michael Connelly is one of, if not the, best contemporary fiction writers. Unlike many popular authors who have one or two good novels in them and then hash out a series of poorly written books to satisfy the publishers, Connelly continues to improve with every work. In this trio of previously published short stories, he once again proves he has the chops. If you have ever written or studied short stories, you've probably read \\"The Gift of the Magi,\\" by O. Henry, in my mind the best short story I've ever read. I read it in high school over 40 years ago, and it never left my mind. The quality of Connelly's sort fiction writing mirrors and matches O. Henry's talent. In this trio, Connelly has created three precise stories that in different ways show us the universal truth of life's bittersweet ironies. No complicated plots here; just life saying, \\"Watch this.\\" I'm so grateful he's so young and still working so hard to improve his already superior craft. Thank you, Michael!
0142419400|5.0|Reasons I wasn't sure if this book would appeal to me:<br /><br />1) It sounds like a cheating book. I hate cheating books.<br /><br />2) It takes place in Paris. I don't like Paris. I know, I'm weird, but when I visited Paris, I just didn't like it. For whatever reason. I don't know. I just don't like it.<br /><br />3) The summary uses the phrase \\"swoon-worthy,\\" which makes me cringe.<br /><br />HOWEVER.<br /><br />None of my problems with this book turned out to actually be problems with this book. Which was a pleasant surprise.<br /><br />I loved Anna. First off, Anna also kind of hates Paris, and thus I felt a kinship with her. She also is socially awkward and goes to painstaking and impractical lengths to keep from coming in contact with other humans, and I was like, YES. I can relate to this!<br /><br />And then I also liked her friends. So often in books, I wind up liking the protagonist and then hating their friends, and then wondering why they're friends in the first place. Not so in this book. They had a natural friend dynamic, where every member of the group had a distinct personality and role to play, and you could see why they would all have gravitated toward each other.<br /><br />Of course, the majority of the plot circles around her relationship with Etienne St. Clair, and her struggle to determine how she feels when she knows he has a girlfriend and she has a maybe-something-or-other back in Atlanta. I was prepared for this to be extremely irritating, either because their friendship wouldn't feel like a real friendship, or because one of them was going to cheat. And I just can't root for cheaters. Period.<br /><br />But. It wasn't irritating. Or at least, not irritating in a way that kept me from enjoying the book. I was irritated alongside Anna. She berated herself for looking for hidden meaning in his actions, and I could completely sympathize. And while there were a few times I just wanted to throttle St. Clair (who, while not a cheater, was a monumentally crappy boyfriend on several occasions), he never crossed that point-of-no-return line where I simply would not be able to hold out hope for him and Anna anymore, because I'd be too busy thinking he was scum.<br /><br />I liked that their friendship was real. They were comfortable, their personalities were complementary, and they just worked well together. One of my favorite chapters was their back-and-forth holiday email exchanges, which is normally one of my least favorite book gimmicks. But their banter seemed natural and easy, and I enjoyed it.<br /><br />Anyway. I could keep talking about this book and how much fun it was and how I loved Anna's snarky yet awkwardly endearing inner monologue and how happy it made me to read about friendships that felt real and a friendship-turned-romance that didn't feel forced. Or I could stop talking and you could just go read it.

0765316994|5.0|This is a wonderfully funny story, with a mind-twisting premise that is intentionally unbelievable -- until you get to the end and are pulled in by the humanity that underlies it.<br /><br />Scalzi is, for me, one of the best SF writers around.  I would rate Stross and Gibson as better users of language, but Scalzi is a master of telling a good tale (\\"Old Man's War\\") and at making it amusing in the process (\\"Last Colony\\").  His first-written novel, \\"Agent to the Stars\\", is one of the most delightfully funny and playful books I know, and he carries that narrative voice forward into this book, albeit with a more complex narrative.  I chuckled through an afternoon of light-hearted encounters with the absurd and then walked away from the codas with a sense that I'd been given something extra, something touching.  Great fun and a great story.

B008CP93S0|2.0|It had a solid cast, a few jokes but overall I was rather disappointed in its drawn out storyline and failure to capture my attention. I think while watching it I kept checking Facebook to see if anything else was more entertaining than this movie.
B007MJSYF0|3.0|I was happy to watch this film because, as a fan of the Hunger Games books, I have been told dozens of times that they are merely a sanitized ripoff of Battle Royale.  Having seen them both, I don't think that the one influenced the other.  Like many have said, there is a long tradition, going back to the gladiators, of people being forced to kill other people for sport.  And the hunting aspect strongly smacks of The Most Dangerous Game.  I enjoyed Battle Royale very much, mostly because it was a lot funnier than I thought it was going to be.  The video explaining the rules, was fantastic, that whole scene was very funny- I could watch that over and over.  But I'm not sure it was intended to be funny, but the over-the-top, flat acting, just made what should have been tense and terrifying, actually loud, chaotic, and campy.  And unlike the Hunger Games, were you have children being sacrificed in a ritual slaughter where half the horror comes from the foreknowledge: the reaping, every year thinking about what might happen, then being chosen, knowing what is going to happen to them while the rest of society is observing, encouraging and celebrating the horror- no such tension exists in Battle Royale.<br /><br />The world of Battle Royale the film is much simpler.  To the point of inanity.  The children are bad, disrespectful, the old do not like the young,  therefore the government is going to secretly kill a few teenagers.  I don't understand the goal of the Progam, the endgame, really.  In Hunger Games, there was a purpose, punishment for rebellion and a reminder of the central, absolute authority: everyone had to watch.  It affected all society.  No one sees what happens on the island in Battle Royale, not even the people RUNNING IT (it is a seriously low-tech distopian torture game), and the students, while they seem aware that Battle Royales have happened in the past, are sufficiently in the dark that none of them seem to know what is going on, even after they have been kidnapped and told this is Battle Royale.  They are like, what, what are you asking?  So in this society, it isn't even serving its purpose as...I don't know what.  Whatever the point of the Program, it sucks, because clearly no one is getting the message.  They need to advertise.  And get some professionals in there.  The teacher that runs it seems clueless.  Apparently the kids teased him (one even randomly stabbed him in the leg 2 years ago, but this is the kind of authoritarian society where the kid wasn't punished, WTF?), so now, he's going to watch them die with gleeful commentary.  He is also apparently primarily motivated by a snotty disrespectful teenage daughter who isn't on the trip.  (Again, clearly The Program is not effective)  Actually, he is pretty funny.  But the premise is insane, and not at all scary, or haunting, or thought provoking, because it is so stupid.<br /><br />The violence, however, is the best part.  It is bloody to the point of absolute camp.  They show every death, so I guess that is what people mean when they described it as \\"not watered down.\\"  Except that you don't really care that they are dying. The characters are, needless to say, static, more caricatures than characters, they don't get a chance at any sort of development.  You watch one fall after the other and what you are really hoping for is that they die in an interesting manner. And they do.  Because in covering 40 deaths, there is about 30 seconds worth of character development -for most of them seconds after they are introduced and mere moments before they die.  It usually goes, confess secret love to girl/boy you've barely spoken to as you die, or he dies, and then, survivor gets shot/stabbed.  Repeat.  The girls are worthless, they are either sheep or, if they actually decide to fight, portrayed as total sociopaths.  The \\"heroine\\" of the piece is literally carried through the movie by male after male after male declaring his willingness to die for her.  No reason, of course, I guess because she's pretty.  Girl power.<br /><br />The boys are more interesting.  This was a fun new aspect of the Program, we never really got to see contestants plot their way out in the Hunger Games, because that hunt had the additional element of tributes being hunted by the game masters and constantly on camera-but in Battle Royale, it is a budget torture, they don't televise or even observe it, so you get to watch all sorts of strategies, by the boys.  These run the gamut from sheep, to sociopath, to noble hero trying to find secret love of his life, to covert resistance fighters.  All in all, they were pretty good.  But still not enough time to care about them so that you were really sad if they died.  I watched like 40 people die in Battle Royale and didn't care half as much over that bus full of kids as I did over one death in the Hunger Games.  The violence and the acting in Battle Royale is so over the top, the motives so simplistic (You teased me, now DIE!), that you honestly don't care if these kids live or die.  Which is good, because they die like, every 5 minutes.  The pacing is beautiful, which is good, it keeps you from trying to think too hard about the weaknesses in the plot.<br /><br />It is, however, super-entertaining.  Funny, violent, well shot- every sadistic smile or high pitched girly fit.  But it isn't the pointed social commentary everyone told me it was.  It left me chuckling, not wondering \\"wow, what would I do?\\"  Maybe they develop something, anything really, more in the book.  Especially the POINT of all of this.  The most affecting image in the film is the first 2 minutes, when they show the outcome of the previous Battle Royale.  The smiling girl with her blood drenched sailor-style school uniform and baby doll.  It implied a sense of public awareness about the Program, like it might inspire national fear.  But none of the kids seems scared in the flashbacks, they ditch school happily and stab their teacher in the leg with immunity, so I'm still puzzled as to the point of all this glorious violence.  But glorious it is, and you should totally watch it.

0525953728|1.0|LIES LIES LIES.. and more PROPOGANDA FROM THE nazi faction that controls america!<br /><br />America is waking up. We know our government is lying to us about 9/11. The people were never told that THREE buildings fell on 9/11 and not just the two that were shown on TV. How did the third building fall when it was across the courtyard and not hit by a plane? Well, the government is hiding the fact that scientists found nanothermite explosives in the rubble. Who planted the explosives in the building before the planes crashed? In addition, why was at Fema waiting at ground zero the night BEFORE 9/11? Why were most of the terrorists found alive in the middle east after our government gave us names. It was all lies!<br /><br />Our government is under the control of the Illuminati bankers, the families who brought hitler to power. They moved over the five thousand nazi scientists after nazi germany into the united states, and they have continued their experimentation on the population. They are murdering the people in the U.S. slowly by poisoning the food,water and air. The food is filled with chemicals and GMO to mutate the human body and cause illness. The air is being sprayed with chemtrails which have been found to contain military created viruses. All vaccinations are dangerous! They are being used to poison the population.<br /><br />You may want to go to Alex Jone's channel and watch the movie the \\"obama  Deception\\" and find out how these elite bankers want to get rid of us and they are also crashing the economy. They did 9/11 in a similar fashion to how Hitler did the Reich-stag fire. If you don't believe this now, do the research and your life will forever be changed with the lies you uncover.

1594203059|2.0|I have been reading Niall Ferguson's material ever since graduating as a freshly-minted political scientist at the beginning of the Nineties.  Ferguson's strengths and weaknesses are comparable to those of the late novelist Michael Crichton: both are/were bright polymaths whose prose, while vigorously readable, reflect unbearable self-satisfaction.  Like many pseudo-Renaissance men of our times, they spout the hoary prejudices of the privileged as if they were biblical epiphanies.  Both have written works which are useful insofar as they challenge the reader to extract facts from folly.  I suspect they've found such a wide audience because they uphold the given world order so well.<br /><br />In \\"Civilization: The West and the Rest,\\" Ferguson uses the trendy term \\"six killer app's\\" for six virtues which he sees as uniquely Western: competition, science, the rule of law, modern medicine, consumerism, and the work ethic.  He weaves Anglo-chauvinism throughout these themes (after taking a moment to extoll his own work ethic).<br /><br />As a historian, Ferguson simply doesn't cut it; it is arguable whether these six trends are unalloyed virtues, or are responsible for Western success.  Moreover, none of these trends are uniquely Western.  In many cases, Western medievalism delayed these advantages from penetrating European cultures while they were being freely employed in the Mid and Far East.<br /><br />His interpretation of the work ethic is a classic of Fergusonian folly: like so many British academics before him, he asks why Northern Europe throve while Southern Europe faded into obscurity.  His answer is as old as it is self-congratulatory: Protestantism.  He cites the conversion of over four-hundred million Chinese to Christianity as the reason for their current economic success; they've become Protestants!<br /><br />With typical overstatement, Ferguson opines that the West is fading because we've forgotten these \\"killer app's;\\" global warming is a relatively insignificant problem.  We could solve it if we simply retained old Western chutzpah.  Perhaps the West would be better served if defeat - Rommel's \\"great educator\\" - would disabuse us of Fergusonian arrogance.significant problem.

Right from the start, McGuire drew me in with her perfect attention to details, letting me know all about her world from its sights, sounds, and smells. She made me laugh, and she made me cry, and WHOA! did she make the temperature in my livingroom go up about 10 degrees.<br /><br />This book is about a your girl named Abby, who runs off with her best friend to Eastern University trying to escape her past and not let it become her future. Abby wants safe and predictgable. At least that is what she wants to want, but when she meets Travis Maddox, the sexy, tattooed, ladies man, her world seems to be quickly slipping into reverse. Will Abby settle for what she wants, or will she finally discover what she needs? Place your bets, and get started reading.<br /><br />Beautiful Disaster gets 5 stars from me, and it will definitely be going on my list of books to read over and over again

I also strongly recommend the phone app for this since it makes keeping track of ladders and reps so much easier.<br /><br />I am very pleased with this book.  It is a bit simple and the writing isn't deep or complex but it gets to the point of things fairly easily.
0345529057|3.0|Book four of the series \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\", \\"A Feast For Crows\\", has pages 767 through 830 cut too short and the action in those pages cannot be followed since the bottom several lines are missing. I want to add that after this, I was finally able to contact amazon and they have solved that problem. Hopefully the substitute book will not have the problem. It is a most interesting series and hate having to lay the one I'm reading down. I found this series more interesting than The Lord of the Rings which I found quite boring at times after the first book.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|most people critical of the book, either didnt read it, believe the bs hype about \\"secrets\\" being leaked, etc. There was no secrets being leaked. A 5th grader could find out weapons, tactics etc, from any Janes pub. The only fools are the ones in washingtoon that leaked the info hours after the raid anyway. He didnt tell on anyone, he didnt disclose facts that werent on CNN anyway. He didnt give real names. This info is common knowledge to anyone with a brain, Google, and other readily available sources. Our government would NEVER tell the truth (and havent anyway about what happened.) Good book, well put together, good facts and story. If you dont like it, then go back to your dreamy life in candyland, thinking your goverment will take care of you, because you cant.

0525953728|4.0|Seriously? I completely understand the thought process behind most of the comments left. The whole 9/11 conspiracy Nazi stuff...not so much. Regardless, if you want to debate the book, trash talk, or what have you, do you really think Amazon.com's comment review section is the best place? This is to review the book itself. If you didn't read the book, don't down vote it when you \\"have not and never will buy this book.\\" If you want to bash it/praise it strictly on a political level and agenda, there are plenty of websites that are there for that purpose specifically! Have at it!<br /><br />Having said that, I pre-ordered this book about a month ago. I read it in one day. No one, in my opinion, is entitled behind my reasoning in buying the book either. Just like I really don't care to know anyone else's! I digress. The book is definitely a page turner. I didn't want to put it down. If you have no background in military terminology, I can understand being a bit lost in that. I even had to call my brother a few times for help. Like I said, it was an entertaining story that was informative and entertaining. However, it seemed very jumpy at times with no clear cut transitioning. One minute you'd be reading about his conversation about the possibility of finding UBL, then you are 9 years in the past. But that is easily overlooked, just not with my ADD.<br /><br />I really didn't want to seem like I was attacking, I just really think the reviews on a book should be strictly on the book. Let the commenting I am sure to receive commence! :-)

B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This was my first YA adult book dealing with college students. And I loved it. The story hooked me. It all started with a bet...Abby is trying to be the good girl and Travis is a bad boy who is used to girls fawning over him all of the time. Despite their differences they become friends, but Travis seems to want more unlike Abby who isn't interested. They end up making a bet that if Travis loses a fight he won't sleep with anyone for a month and if Abby loses she has to live with him in his apartment for a month. That's when things get more interesting between these two. Their friendship progresses into something more which everyone but Abby seems to realize.<br />I liked the intensity and passion that they created when they were together. Their relationship was deep and at times borderline unhealthy, but I could not stop reading. It took me on an emotional ride that would not let up. They each came with their own set of issues and baggage. I liked how the author explored some of their background, so that the characters could be better understood. Even though their relationship was crazy, it worked...they worked. They made each other happy and understood each other like no one else did.  I was rooting for them the whole way.

Unfortunately, the connection would lose signal for him, but even worse, the same would happen to me at home in the same location! We read the reviews but wanted to hope for the best. No matter what the price is (although I believe it's high), bottom line is it isn't worth it, which is too bad.

B00756GKBA|5.0|I don't understand people judging this album, i mean, it's not her best but definately not her worst. The album has amazing quality songs like Love Spent, Masterpiece and Beautiful Killer.<br />People think it's bad because the first single is the weakest track on the album, but there are other singles like Girl Gone Wild and Turn Up The Radio that deserve to be bigger hits.

B007SGM084|5.0|Fifty Shades Trilogy was the best read!  I loved Christian and Anatasia. My favorite parts were the lively banter between them on email.  Dark turning to light is the best way to describe the underlying theme. The onslaught of sexual tension was amazing.  Christian's total dedication to his wife was refreshing in today's world of unfaithfulness.  I will read it again!
B0011XBLUS|5.0|This classic Western just gets better every time I watch it. The movie opens on an arid panoramic vista, and we are serenaded by the familiar coyote's howl that became the most recognized five note theme in cinematic history. Suddenly, a grizzled face of a bounty hunter pops into view in extreme closeup. From this first scene to the last, where \\"the good\\" Blondie literally vanishes into the landscape like an element returning to its natural state, Sergio Leone's complex masterpiece has enough visual treasure and multi-layered meaning to satisfy the most demanding movie lover.<br /><br />Clint Eastwood biographer and Time movie critic Richard Schickel does a decent job with his commentary, but I was surprised by his take on composer Ennio Morricone's stunning finale. Mr. Schickel, that is not postmodern decontextualized mariachi music, that is Morricone's interpretation of the merciless Mexican bugle call \\"El DeGuello\\", sounded when the order \\"No Quarter\\" is given. It is Death itself charging through the air.<br /><br />This movie is fundamentally a meditation on the question of how to live when surrounded by death. The ultimate question we all face, just not as bluntly as portrayed here. \\"The ugly\\" Eli Wallach's brilliant portrayal of the genial bandit Tuco, who never loses his love of life, is also an Everyman. Tuco somehow muddles his way through catastrophes with the help of his mysterious friend Blondie, played impassively by Clint Eastwood. Yet the ungrateful Tuco doesn't realize how many times Blondie has saved his life. Or does he?<br /><br />Fans of Flannery O'Connor will recognize the operation of grace in Leone's fallen and corrupt world of grotesques, where everyone robs and betrays everyone, and deserving death has nothing to do with the fact that it comes for all. The \\"good\\" Blondie is called Tuco's guardian angel by<br />the \\"bad\\" and magnificent Lee Van Cleef, who gives us one of the finest portrayals of villainy ever filmed. Everyman happens upon angel and devil in his struggle through life - which will he side with in the final showdown, as he vainly fires his empty gun?<br /><br />It took years before Leone got the credit he deserved for his gimlet-eyed but not unhopeful portrayal of an American West full of sweaty, dirty, violent men, downtrodden women, flies, starving dogs, ruined towns, bombed-out churches and a wasteland of war dead and wounded. Yet amid all the sorrow, and with no justification that we can discern, the<br />irrepressible Tuco cheats Death one more time, laughs his belly laugh, and lights up the screen with his smile. And we light up with him.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|After all of the huffing and puffing over Mr. Grey by my girlfriends, I decided, why not?  These books are NOT only about kinky sex as some may say.  It is a book about love and compromise above all else.  Quit reading the reviews and start the book with an open mind and give it a shot, you won't be disappointed.
0062101897|5.0|This book is amazingly detailed. When I got it for Christmas I couldn't help just flipping through it for hours just looking at the glossy pages and pictures. When I actually read it, it took days! It is incredibly heavy, so I recommend propping it on a pillow in your lap. It has a lot of little interesting details about the filmmaking process as well as behind the scenes details - like why Harry has blue eyes in the movie instead of just wearing green contacts.

B0036BK6MW|4.0|I had heard many rave reviews about \\"The Blind Side\\" and I had read an article (I believe the book came later) about Michael Orr in the NY Times magazine section so I know the story. So I came to watch the DVD expecting disappointment. But I was pleasantly surprised. Although a tad sentimental the movie manages to stay just one side of schmaltzy and a much of this comes from the no-nonsense practical understated sensibility of Bullock's portrayal. This is a woman who does what she thinks is right, rooted in her faith and ethics, but without making a song and dance about it and just doing it.<br />Bullock's supporting cast could not be better. Each one of the actors completely inherits his or her character and dialog flows easily and naturally a quality which is not always easy to maintain. There are some nice little touches too - the Thanksgiving Dinner where Michael, inspired by a Norman Rockwell painting, insists on eating at the dinner table while the others are watching television, and ends up getting his Norman Rockwell minute.<br />This is not the very best sports movie I have seen which is why I rate it 4 rather than 5 stars. That is still \\"Chariots of Fire\\" in my book. But it ranks with \\"Remember the Titans\\" and \\"Hoosiers\\" which is pretty high praise.
0307477479|2.0|This poor kind of writing made me realize that just because a work won the Pulitzer Prize, it isn't necessarily good.  No depth, no new ideas, nothing really \\"real\\" in the characters, and questionable presentation and organization.  Maybe I should try writing something and maybe I'll win a Pultizer too, if their standards are so low.  Authors should really try and come up with something original, something new, but at the same time something that people can relate to, and not try to cater to naive tastes, which is what this book seems to do.

B004DLPXAO|3.0|I just started using the Kindle for Android app and I am a little disappointed with the apparent lack of user controllable settings on the application.  I attempted to read one of the books that I had downloaded in PDF format on my Nexus 7 and the app would not let me adjust the font size for easier reading.  The only thing it would allow was to \\"pinch\\" to reduce or expand the virtual screen which would cause the text to overflow the physical screen so I had to keep scrolling back and forth (left/right) to read the text instead of reformatting the text to a larger font size.  The instructions say to tap the center of the screen to bring up a control to set the font but for some reason that did not work.  I am using the latest Kindle app from the Android store and it indicates that there are no updates available.<br /><br />I was hoping that the Kindle app would bring a good reading experience but I am not happy with it.  Maybe it works better with Kindle formatted books instead of PDFs but I would be reluctant to buy a Kindle formatted book only to find that it was equally unpleasant to read.<br /><br />I would be interested in hearing from the Kindle support folks to see what answer they might have.

B007J4T2G8|2.0|So after months of being heckled by my friends and family for not picking this \\"amazing\\" book up I caved and read it. I am an avid reader of romance, erotica, etc, and the book captured my interest in the beginning. I actually enjoyed the first chapters and thought the writing was easy to read and interesting; I was hooked on wanting to see where the relationship was going. Now, everyone has a right to their opinions, but I am a little shocked at some of the negative feedback about the BDSM that occurs in the book....did those people not read the reviews? Of course it is about bondage, and I went in looking forward to reading about the dynamic.<br />  That was the beginning of the end for me really. I was happy to see the author took the time to lay out the rules and  start to explore the BSDM culture that the plot leans heavily upon, however she loses all control of where the plot goes with it. It was extremely thin and honestly, I grew tired of reading about Grey, who was supposedly so dependent on this lifestyle, and had never been able to move away from it, now seemingly tortured immediately after meeting Ana to throw away a large portion of his rules, hangups, and sexual preferences, so he could please her. I mean he never sleeps with a woman but sleeps with her almost immediately, time after time, with little to no protest?? I guess that I know too much about the BDSM lifestyle to be able to comfortably read through this mans sudden change in lifestyle for a woman that he barely knows. If you have a certain need and desire for that lifestyle you dont just keep forgetting those needs because she \\"chews her lip\\" and blushes every two seconds.<br />  Which brings me to the biggest problem I had with the book. I absolutely disliked Ana. Not so much in the beginning, but by the end I had the opinion that she was too annoying for me to contemplate reading another one of the books. She is juvenile, petty, and just plain ANNOYING. The fact that she starts this \\"relationship\\" with this man who is about as straightforward about what he wants from her as he can be, and she knows from the get-go exactly what the relationship will entail, but every encounter is her agonizing over him, the sex, their relationship because she wants him to change everything he wants to be the man she wants him to be, absolutely disgusted me. I was laying the book down at times, thoroughly so disgusted with her I had to leave the book for a time. Anas reactions, the fact that she wants to please him then doesnt, then changes her mind, then again...and on and on and on. Jeesh. He wants her for a reason, he is open about it, gives her every option to work out her needs in their relationship, is attentive, caring, and bends time and time again to try to please her. She whines, cries, demands more, complains, is never satisfied, and acts like a spoiled child when he doesnt change right away to be the person that SHE wants. Too annoying to deal with. I understand the character cant be expected to fall right into this lifestyle with a man she hardly knows without some angst, but a whole book worth of whining? Write about a WOMAN next time who may be scared and has issues, but that we can explore the realtionship with, and watch as the characters grow, engrossed and cheering for them the entire time. If you enjoy this subject, there are many books out there that are wonderful, fulfilling reads; this one I could have done without.onship\\" with this man who is about as straightforward about what he wants from her as he can be, and she knows from the get-go exactly what the relationship will entail, but every encounter is her agonizing over him, the sex, their relationship because she wants him to change everything he wants to be the man she wants him to be, absolutely disgusted me.

0812550706|3.0|This book was recommend by so many people and there was so much positive feedback that I finally read it.<br /><br />I found the book very hard to read and it took me a year to finally get through it because I did not find it all that interesting. However, I'm not a SciFi fan, so you may take that with a grain of salt. The book was decent enough to keep me sufficiently curious to continue to the end to see what was going to happen. I also wondered if there was some surprise ending or message at the end that would pull it all together. I was disappointed to get to the end and not find that twist or 'ah ha' moment I was seeking.<br /><br />The book is simply a unique science fiction plot. It is written well enough and the story is original with some subtle, but real, connections to reality that will make you consider your own views on life--if you so desire--but there was no profound message or lesson.

1932100660|5.0|This is a must read, after purchasing Forks Over Knives I was settling into a vegetarian diet but once i started reading The China Study i became totally vegan and I am enjoying the benefits.  One being i have lost 20 kilos or 44 lbs in 20 weeks. I was not by any means hugely overwieght either now i am the weight i was in my twenties and i am even back pounding the pavements.  This book really will change the way you think about food and gives you the formula for long term health and weight management.  If you are interested in improving your health and or overcoming any weight issues forever then this book is for you.  It is well written and easy to read and it just makes sense! Any sane person will question the Western Diet's benefits if any once completed. I give it a big thumbs up!!!!
B0091VTISO|2.0|The story is nonsense, and I mean NON SENSE.  The bad guy gets the final piece from Conan's father than can't figure out for how many years what to do? I assume PURE meant \\"virgin\\" and all indications thru out the movie with the bitchy daughter would lead one to conclude that.  She drinks the blood of the main female character AFTER she's had an orgy nite with Conan and what?  The whole s.....t with the quest to get all the pieces to achieve immortality is pure nonsense!
0307959856|1.0|Here's a universal truth: this book stinks.<br /><br />I should have read the reviews before I purchased. I saw an ad in a magazine, and even though it crossed my mind that it might be bad, I love Jane Austen and I love P.D. James, and couldn't resist. I am now half way through \\"Death Comes to Pemberley\\" and can say one thing with confidence. The victim in this \\"case\\" is P.D. James. She has been murdered, and the crime has been covered by a hack ghost writer and a greedy editor, because there is no way P.D. James wrote any of this.<br /><br />The manuscript -- it can't actually be called a book, it reads so much like a first draft -- drowns the reader with page after page of run-on sentences in a fake \\"English\\" style featuring dreadful description, joyless characters, pointless red herrings, and a plot so dull and heavy it could be used as a blunt instrument and kill someone. And I won't even talk about the many downright errors.<br /><br />Shame, shame, shame on the editors who saw a chance to make a quick buck and capitalized on it: you got me!

The vinyl has a lot of dead space, so the grooves could have been wider for better sound.  Confusing:  Why was Bob Ezrin dressed like Count Dracula in all of the pictures?

B007J4T2G8|5.0|I had seen some reviews on this book and wasn't sure if it would be enough to keep my attention. Wow! The story is fantastic. Yes, where could you ever in your life find a Christian Grey perfect type of guy, but you know what, we don't read these books for the absolute realism. We read it for the drama and the fantasy of it all.<br />Reading this book was like having a window into these two young folks' heart as they start a relationship neither one of them believe they are capable of. The relationship and how it forms and is nurtured is what this book is all about! Ok, there are some awesome other parts that folks talk about, but read past it and see the relationship. That's the real story.<br />Great read! But be warned that once you've read the first book, you have to read the other two to get the entire story. Enjoy!

B002MQYOFW|5.0|While the party may have ended, the band has packed up their instruments and is boarding their bus back to Panem, the streamers have been torn down by the kiddos, and everything that could have been said about THE HUNGER GAMES has probably already been said, I still feel the need to review it. Why? Because I've never been very good at marching in step with the rest of the crowd. Plus, as I write this, THE HUNGER GAMES occupies #9 of the Amazon Kindle eBooks Bestseller List for only the 840th day.<br /><br />So how did Suzanne Collins create this international party with a rabid group of followers? By writing a damn good novel, and despite catering to the YA crowd, she held nothing back with the violence, as she dropped it across the blood spattered pages. As for her main character Katniss Everdeen, she is the real hero of this story, and she's the glue that holds this entire novel together. Without being inside of her head every second of this novel, the entire structure on which it is built would fall apart. You can claim that this should have been written in third person, and that it would have added suspense, as well as rounded out the other characters. But it would have changed the focus of the novel entirely, and it would have lacked immediacy. In order for first person to work successfully, a novel needs a strong, well-defined main character. Check and check.<br /><br />She does a great job with world-building, and I was sucked right into the kiddie pool with the surroundings, circumstances, characters, districts, and everything else that she so expertly articulated. So what if the love triangle is overdone? Without it, the story would have lacked heart. Besides, if you really want to talk plot, there are only seven basic plots, according to Cristopher Booker. Sure, this number ends up being a bit arbitrary, but it's not like authors have an unlimited number of plots to choose from. So what it really boils down to is execution. Over and over again this book proves its point with Katniss, the quick flip of the pages (or push of the button for us Kindle users), the action scenes, how far we get into Katniss's head, and the world-building. If you haven't already hopped on THE HUNGER GAMES phenomenon, you better board the bus now, or you're liable to miss out on the after-party.<br /><br />Robert Downs<br />Author of Falling Immortality: Casey Holden, Private Investigatoroves its point with Katniss, the quick flip of the pages (or push of the button for us Kindle users), the action scenes, how far we get into Katniss's head, and the world-building.

1401923127|1.0|In The Biology of Belief, author Bruce Lipton presents two basic messages with conviction -- and then retracts them.<br /><br />One message is that we can heal ourselves and achieve great things if only we believe without a shimmer of doubt that we can do these things.  He cites a few silly examples (but no data on a scale that convinces).<br /><br />Then he backs down and says that until we can conquer the powerful subconscious, we are not going to be able to believe to the degree that makes healing and achievement possible.  Has anyone conquered the subconscious? Well, no, says Lipton, but practitioners of energy psychology are working on it (for big fees, observes this reviewer).<br /><br />So, Lipton hands us the power of belief, and then takes it away.<br /><br />The second message is that the self exists outside the material body. Each individual's cells have a unique set of receptors that download the self from the environment.  Lipton asserts, \\"Every functional protein is a complementary 'image' of an environmental signal.  Therefore we are made in the image of the environment, that environment being the Universe, or to many, God.\\"<br /><br />Then he ratchets the environment down from Universe/God to Earth.  He notes that we are destroying this environment and changing the signals while our receptors remain the same.  Then he says that we are like Mars rovers that receive information from an interactive environmental controller -- NASA in the case of real rovers, or Spirit in the case of . . . us, I guess.<br /><br />So, he hands us eternal existence outside the self and then says, no, it's information coming from a controller, and we alter that incoming information by the way in which we lead our lives.<br /><br />Where does that leave the reader, Dr. Lipton?

075669910X|4.0|There seems to be a big mistake on page 14 where the book indicates that the distance from the sun to the edge of the solar system is 3700 billion miles.  I think that was supposed to be 3700 million miles or 3.7 billion miles. Actually 3.7 billion miles is the distance from the sun to Pluto and there is still more solar system after Pluto. Voyager 1 is currently (as of mid-2012) at around 11.1 billion miles from Earth and is considered to be near the edge of the solar system.  I haven't read the whole book yet, so I hope there aren't any more mistakes like that one.  Other than this mistake, I really like the book.
B008BIN9EW|5.0|I can't say more than what was already said about this game.  I will say this though.  This is only the second review I have done.  The first wasn't too great.<br /><br />I had gotten this game when it was the FAOTD and I've been hooked on it ever since!  I've not delved much into the online portions of it since I don't like to wait too much.  I've been playing the Solo after playing the Campain portion.  I don't know how many hours I've spent on this game, but I've ran the battery down on my Kindle Fire more than half a dozen times since I've gotten this game.<br /><br />This is one of those games that is well worth the $4.99 they are asking for it.  You can have a LOT of replay value on this, and that is BEFORE you get to the online portions!!  The online portions will give you so much more!!!<br /><br />Developers.....As some others have said.....Thank you for not creating a game that requires a lot of questionable permissions!

B008P76UKE|5.0|Lorin Maazel considered requests to create a synthesis of Wagner's Ring cycle as a continuous `Ring without Words' twice before finally agreeing to the request made by the recording company, Telarc, in 1987. The resultant 75 minute recording proved to be a big seller and in Maazel's opinion it helped to create a new audience for the operas.<br /><br />In creating this continuous synthesis Maazel attempted to produce a reduced version which followed strict chronological order and which introduced all the main themes and motifs without adding a single note not written by Wagner. In this he reinforced Wieland Wagner's view (Wagner's Grandson) that the essence of the work lies in the orchestral score.<br /><br />Weiland Wagner's view is worth considering in this context and can be quoted as stated to Maazel at a rehearsal of the Ring as `The orchestra, that's where it all is - the text behind the text, the universal subconscious that binds Wagner's personae one to another and to the proto-ego of legend ....'<br /><br />As one who has known The Ring cycle for around 40 years or so this synthesis is both impressive and intriguing. It is also successful in terms of what was attempted as in paragraphs 1-2 above. It is impressive because it covers so many of the key moments and intriguing because it jumps unexpectedly from one key point to another without including what you would expect to hear next! It becomes a sort of quiz - spot the excerpt, and a rather enjoyable one too!<br /><br />The whole experience is enormously enhanced by the wonderful playing of the Berlin Philharmonic at full strength. Four harps is an impressive sight not to mention vast ranks of strings and incisively burnished brass. If ever an orchestra was born to play this music it has to be this one. The visual impact provides a real advantage over audio only reproduction.<br /><br />In terms of reproduction, this early example of high definition recording from 2000 is a complete success with crisp imaging of considerable clarity and fully involving camera work. The sound is wide ranging and presented in DTS-HD 5.1 as well as stereo. There is a short bonus in which Maazel says much of what is relayed above and which is even more fully covered in the sleeve notes.<br /><br />As a keen Wagner Ring enthusiast, I still found this a very enjoyable experience for all the reasons above. I would expect it to give much pleasure to all but the most hardened of purists and, in addition, it might be a very useful way of getting to know the basics of the opera cycle as an introduction in miniature so to speak. For all the above reasons therefore, and in my own personal opinion, it seems only reasonable to rate this as a 5 star issue.<br /><br />In conclusion, I would suggest that this fine disc should, at the very least, warrant serious consideration from purchasers interested in this popular program.<br /><br />........................................<br /><br />Some dialogue from the comments section that may offer further help:<br /><br />A wonderful review. I was at first thinking of the Ring exposition I heard in college, which was definitely with words and accompanied by the London Philharmonic. That was in the 1960s and long before digital recordings. I look forward to this recording all the more.

B00846REIS|2.0|This book is so annoying. Its such a copy of fifty shades of grey. The characters aren't nearly as likeable as Anastasia or Christian. The author took someone else's idea and altered a few things. I couldn't finish the book because the story was way too famaliar.
B00632HWOG|5.0|The app. For android is easy to manage and works exactly the way it was designed. I have not had a single problem with it. It works just like the Pc version. Navigation is simple and direct. I have used Yahoo mail for many years and found it to be the least complicated of them all.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Very well written, enjoyable read. for someone who has never served he gives an account that anyone can follow.<br /><br />Politically, he was pretty neutral. It is obvious that he in no a big fan of pres. Obama but then again I got the impression that he was not particully a fan of Washingtion in general. The latter I believe is probubly the view of most service men and women.<br /><br />The book its self is a pretty clear look into seal team 6. Very intresting Very Well Done.<br /><br />Good luck to you in the future 'Mark Owen' thank you for your service.
B007CMD5EC|4.0|I've been a fan of John5 for many years, he motivated me to try learning guitar after seeing him on the Holy Wood tour when he was playing with Marilyn Manson.  This album is a prime example of how he has mastered his craft and effortlessly floats between notes while leaving you stunned.  My favorite track is easily Noche Acosador.  I was disappointed by the DVD, especially when that's what held up the album for so long, but everything can't be gold.  Highly recommended.
B005LAIGQE|5.0|I loved this movie, a human relations story. People of interest, the whales just a representation of what goes on every day somewhere.  It showes how we can work together, share culture and our resposibility to care for God's creatures.
B0063FGFK0|4.0|I went in to this not expecting much, but I was pleasantly surprised.  I liked this movie a lot, and I'd feel confident recommending others watch it.  It was also very cool to see Slaine in it, I'm a big fan and it's awesome to see someone be able to perform well in more than one medium.  This edition is more of the definitive one as well, with another ending and a ton of bonus materials.  If you're going to pick up The Town, this is the one to get.

0345803485|1.0|Right. I've already spent some time trashing Harry Plodder, now it's time for me to get my teeth into Fifty Shades of Sheeet - oh, I am sorry, I mean Grey. I bet no one's ever made that joke before!<br /><br />So, putting the Bristol Stool Chart aside, let's take a look at this phenomemenonemonon that has swept the world's literary er... world. First things first, E.L. James can do characters. Before I diss everything else, I'll give her credit for nailing the most irritating, weedy and pathetic little w*nk sock that has ever been portrayed in fiction. Because that is what Ana (unfortunate that it only has one `n', because I keep thinking of anal) is, a big crusty sock that doesn't complain whenever someone uses it for self-pleasure.<br /><br />Actually, you know what? I'm glad they're going to make a movie of it, because surely no script can be as badly written as this. Maybe they can get an actress good enough to make the main protagonist likeable. Maybe they can find a Titan to kill off that sodding `inner goddess' that she keeps going on about. Maybe they can give her a backbone and some spunk. Oh, no. Not that. No.<br />And why does she keep saying \\"Oh my\\"? No one says that. No one British, and I've certainly never heard an American say that post-1956.<br /><br />Christian is her abuser, her `sexy' abuser. What sort of man pushes a girl into doing things she doesn't want to do? I have the answer, and it's A GIT. An abusive GIT. How is that sexy? Yes, a man taking control - sexy. A man who knows what he's doing - sexy! Even better, a man who listens to what his partner wants - extra sexy! But I'm afraid I found his arguments about what she had to do a real turn-off. It's at that point that I would go to the local plant rental company, hire a JCB and drive it into his stupid, smug, rapist face.<br /><br />And what about his amazing body, massive knob and beautiful face? All I got when I imagined him were pictures of a boss-eyed, hairy, inbred psycho with a nose like a pig.<br /><br />Anyway, it seems that feminism may be dead (of course he's also rich - I mean, you can't have a sexy poor man, can you?!?), but James created some believably unlikeable characters.<br /><br />What else can I comment on? The beautiful prose? The striking yet tasteful imagery? No. Because the writing in this book is bad. And not just poor, pop-fiction-style basic, but BAAAAAAAAAAAAD.<br /><br />First off, I hate first-person narrative. Very, very few writers can make it not sound like a child's description of what they do each day, or an instructional DVD on how to glue bits of newspaper to your furniture in order to obtain a fashionable-yet-rustic finish. It just sounds puerile. And crap. And... oh, so unbelievably basic. There are sentences that should be cut into two parts. A comma is not a full stop! Argghhhhh,,,,,,,,,,,<br /><br />And the nouns she uses to describe the environment - look - the idea of writing is not to just describe what you see like there's a blind person next to you, it's to provide atmosphere! Don't just say you're intimidated. Say that the building leers. Or perhaps it creates shadows that claw at the ground beneath and your soul within? Or what about saying that the steel-wrought skeleton shines so cold that the sun shatters off it in shards of ice-coloured light? Add a bit of artistry, woman!<br /><br />Then, as I got to the sexy bit, I realised that there is no imagination in this book. But S&M is a bit daring and imaginative, surely? What, are you kidding? Who hasn't tied their significant other up? Who hasn't been a bit rapey? Erm... More to the point, how many other erotic novels have been published (and more literarily valid ones) that explore more interesting sex? Judging by the number of self-pubbed sexy books coming out at the moment, thousands, I'm sure.<br /><br />The dialogue is banal. It's like James has taken all of the really dull conversation that goes on between two people who actually secretly hate each other, and has then chosen to print it. I'm referring, of course, to the relationship between Ana and her roomy. Ana doesn't actually like Kate. Judging by her thoughts, she wants to fudge her up, big time.<br /><br />Oh yes, and you should never write \\"Mmm\\" in the middle of a sex scene. What's going on? Has he just had a nice mug of Bisto? Are they eating chocolate mousse? Are they Alan Partridge?<br /><br />Clich&eacute;s. There are many of them. You know that when you see `pedal to the metal' within the first two pages that you are not in for a terribly inventive ride.<br /><br />Just as nine out of ten people are said to enjoy gang rape, it seems that judging by FSoG's aggregated rating, nine out of ten people seem to enjoy reading about a woman with the mind of a child being taken advantage of.

B005CK76ZA|5.0|I was iffy about purchasing this after reading some of the reviews on Amazon, but I do have to disagree. I am really impressed with the sound quality, especially compared to the original CD that I still have. The bonus content is awesome, the only disappointment is the lack of \\"Endless Nameless\\" at the end of the original album, but not every copy of Nevermind had it.
B0063IH60K|5.0|easy to play. I like the options that you have. don't. have a problems with ads so it is free.
B001IWV04Y|4.0|I can't get enough of Prison Break. I wish the series was still on. Lots of excitement and drama. It's worth watching.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I absolutely loved these books! Initially I was reluctant to read them (just didn't seem like my kind of book) but I had several friends ranting and raving about them so I gave it a shot. I was totally engrossed in the story and couldn't put my kindle down until I devoured all three books. I am so glad I bought the triology so I could keep reading without having to stop. I would highly recommend this series!!!
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|My daughter and I both are addicted to this game! Hope they come up with more like it!Especially enjoying the fact that it is s free game and never crashes my Kindle.

0307594009|5.0|I've been familiar with the Anne Frank story for a long time, but only upon reading her story completely has it become fully real. This is an excellent edition to read, as it contains much more material than previous published versions. It was a joy to follow Anne through the formative years that she spent in \\"The Annex.\\"  She was so bright and full of life. So filled with teen angst and frustrations as she matured from a little girl into a self realized young adult. I have a daughter that is the same age as Anne when she entered her hiding place. Reading her story, from her own perspective, was like watching a beautiful flower as it slowly matured into the fullness of its beauty. Anne was not without her faults, but she did surprisingly well considering the conditions. Her story was so full of promise. She ultimately recognized her faults and her strengths and began to chart a course for her future life after the war. She was to become a journalist. Think of the impact she might have had! But then the evil Nazis plucked that gorgeous flower and smashed it under their dirty boots. They killed the precious young girl at the prime of her life, just as they killed so many others who never had a chance to tell their stories. Hitler deserves to be damned for this one soul, but his crimes are magnified by millions. As I read the Afterword, tears came to my eyes. Every pacificist and appeaser should read this story. If only we could have entered the war a few months earlier! We were so close to saving her and her family - we were close, but too late. My heart of thanks goes out to all the heroes who died to bring an end to the Nazi atrocities.
B0069G5Z9K|2.0|First I will say that the gameplay is great. However, after buying so many gadgets the game starts to say that I did not buy ones that I had. It also lets me buy several of the same gadget. Its frustrating to unlock gadget levels and then have to rebuy gadgets to unlock the level again. The game needs some improvements...
B007M45XL8|5.0|I love this album. From start to finish it is great. I have loved many albums by Dr. John especially \\"Babylon\\" and \\"In the right place\\", this album has many things in it that stick in my mind for days. Every song on this album could stand by itself, they each flow from one song to the other very well. I am actually trying to get down to Nashville tonight to see him play tomorrow. I have never seen him at a live show and i think it would be a great experience. Truly an icon. I hope you purchase the album and enjoy it as much as i have.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|There really isn't much one can say against this app.  It truely is a free calculator, the buttons and &quot;screen&quot; are large and very easy to read.  The screen show the most recent input as well.  The ads are small and at the top and are not ar all intrusive.

B0058SNJG6|5.0|I bought the Crocs Women's Jayna Slip on Loafer for my daughter who is a beautician.  With her doing hair all day she is constantly on her feet.  She had been wearing the Black Dansko Clogs for over $100 a pair but when she tried out the crocs she was amazed at how good they felt and how much money she could save by switching from the Dansko's to the Crocs.  She wears them for up to 10 hours each day and swears by them!  I definitely recommend the Crocs.
B008O69SZ0|5.0|Followed this guy since '69. Classic album after classic album. Writes more intelligent lyrics than anyone in the biz. (You know , the ones you enjoy reading when you're listening to the disc)<br />Can't wait to hear what Ian adds to the live set from WIP.<br />The disc rocks hard and repeated play benefits the listener. I spun it four times in a row after receipt.<br />The cd is truly a band effort , and what a band !<br />\\"When I'm President\\" demands a second term !<br />Jesus , this cd rocks !

B00004UIP1|2.0|This recording of Mozart's sublime 'Cosi fan tutte' was issued in 1999 and almost immediately received many, many accolades.  The mainstream classical press lauded it to high heaven, and judging by amazon's customer reviews, many buyers are totally satisfied with their purchase.  So mine is clearly a minority opinion, but I think it's a dud.  I've owned the CDs for years, and despite pulling it out now and again to give it another chance, have never warmed to it.    Some people accuse modern opera performances of being conductor-driven, that is, oriented around the conductor and not the singers.  That seems to me to be the core problem with this set.  The most interesting performer here is Jacobs.  The \\"freshness\\" so many reviewers comment on comes from Jacobs's nearly constant attempts at finding new things in the score, new balances of instruments, new tempi, and overall new effects.  It does indeed sound very new, but it's not clear to me that this newness comes from Mozart or Jacobs's tinkering with Mozart.  It's exciting, but it's also disorienting and a little willful.  One is constantly aware of the orchestra, aware of it even when arguably our focus should be on the singers.  And they, unfortunately, are a not terribly exciting bunch.  The most distinctive is Gens, who has an interestingly colored, immediately recognizable timbre.  People seem to love her, but tone quality aside, I find her technique iffy and her characterization superficial.  Despite her experience with baroque music, she fares no better in her part's difficult coloratura passages than any of the classic Fiordiligis of yore (Schwarzkopf, Caballé, Lorengar, the Prices).  She is also occasionally quite off pitch.  She sounds like a good singer performing Fiordiligi's music and not, well, like a Neapolitan noblewoman in the midst of a crisis of conscience, or like a great singer trying to approximate that character.  The rest of the cast is, frankly, completely forgettable.  They all performperfectly well, but none of them has a voice distinctive enough to stick in my mind even ten minutes after hearing them.    This would be a problem with any recorded opera, but it is especially problematic with Cosi, which is an exploration of complex human relationships, and when your singers are as tonally one dimensional as they are here, they never really register as human beings.  They register as sounds.  Some reviewers comment on how well the ensembles come together in this recording, but these moments stick out because they are inherently more vivid than the arias.  The arias themselves seem to go for nothing.    If this set brings new listeners to Mozart's and da Ponte's profound, deeply human work of art, then more power to it.  But I, for one, would recommend just about any commercial recording from the 60s, 70s, 80s, and even early 90s over this.  I'll now duck to avoid the spears that will likely be thrown at me, while reaching for the entirely inauthentic but gloriously alive Leinsdorf/RCA recording to remind me just how much humanity, and how much life, is to be found in this opera.
B006J38144|2.0|I think this season was a little too over the top - heads in the bag, head in the chile, and too cliched.  Too many good characters were killed off, just to start a new story line - next season will probably be about dealing with the big mobster wanting revenge for his daughters death.  And the new regime - Clay trying to take back his spot, Gemma reconciling that she isnt the big girl on the block, now Tara is.  She is now just the ex presidents old lady - or she and clay will have to work it out - or stay broke up etc. Some of it was a bit too much and too bloody.  I must say this season was less than optimum in my book and I have been watching for a long time now.
B008KWHM6U|4.0|In 2010,the Northern Ireland trio, Two Door Cinema Club, busted onto the indie-pop scene with their debut album TOURIST HISTORY.  It was an album that carefully balanced melodic rock with rhythms bold enough to dance to.  This time around, the band feels a bit more confident in their music and lyrics, with the music venturing closer to disco/dance at times (not in a bad way though).  Their 2012 release BEACON is good, but it's just not quite as good as their debut - while it does feel more mature in regards to their tone and lyrical style, the album doesn't quite capture the fun, wistful spirit of its predecessor.<br /><br />The album begins with \\"Next Year,\\" one of the album's best tracks.  BEACON does well to start with its best foot forward, and this song contains many of the band's trademark sounds: electronics blended with indie sensibilities, careful attention to melody and harmonies, strong propulsive rhythms.  The band's push towards electronic-oriented sounds is apparent on \\"Handshake\\" and \\"Wake Up.\\"  This shift never feels alienating though - it feels natural, and it's incredibly infectious.  On \\"Pyramid,\\" the song's verses use strange, disorienting percussion/electronics - it might take a while to get used to, but it's an interesting listen.<br /><br />The album's lead single, \\"Sleep Alone\\" treats listeners to a larger-than-life chorus -- the chorus of \\"Sleep Alone\\" pushes forward with some giant harmonies, breaking up the pace of the album and preparing listeners for the more subdued \\"The World is Watching You.\\"  \\"The World is Watching You,\\" a duet with Valentina, is one of the more quieter and intimate songs on the album, but it's a strong track.  Vocalist Alex Trimble and guest vocalist Valentina have a nice back-and-forth delivery here that's worth checking out.  After this nice duet, the band doesn't pick up steam immediately: \\"Settle\\" is another slower song, but it bursts into action during the chorus.  For the last song, \\"Beacon,\\" the band is able to create a more smoky and moody atmosphere for their music - while it's not as energetic as some of their other songs here, it's a nice sound, and a promising direction for the band.<br /><br />Overall, BEACON is a solid album that delivers some memorable melodies and a few songs that you're sure to have on repeat.  If you've actively been waiting for BEACON, it will prove to be a treat.  If you're new to Two Door Cinema Club, I would recommend starting with their TOURIST HISTORY before dipping your toes into this album.  I would recommend this band to fans of Bombay Bicycle Club, Young the Giant, and Phoenix.  Essential tracks to sample/download: \\"[[ASIN:B0092SQDNY Sun]],\\" \\"[[ASIN:B0092SQBVI Next Year]],\\" and \\"[[ASIN:B008IN1DCA Sleep Alone]].\\"  BEACON is a good album, and one that won't disappoint, but it just doesn't quite reach the same heights as TOURIST HISTORY did.to create a more smoky and moody atmosphere for their music - while it's not as energetic as some of their other songs here, it's a nice sound, and a promising direction for the band.<br /><br />Overall, BEACON is a solid album that delivers some memorable melodies and a few songs that you're sure to have on repeat.

B004I8WD6E|5.0|I dropped my iPhone 4 once and I was sad when the back case was broken, since then I've had to get cheap replacements of the back cover with Blue/Silver plastic/glass backs. I decided to get this clear case sometime ago, the reviews about it being hard to get off is very true, but that's why I bought it, because that sounds very sturdy to me! I wouldn't want my iPhone 4 to slip out very easily!<br /><br />I have dropped my iPhone 4 more then 15 times since I've gotten this case, and not a single time was my iPhone 4 cracked. It landed face down or faced up, even from about 160CM it was dropped on two occasions and the iPhone 4 was fine. I am scared to drop it on purpose however, because I am not sure if it actually is possible to break the iPhone 4, haha...<br /><br />A warning to iPhone 4 users with a cheap replacement cover (back or front), it is likely to break upon drop or sitting on (I have skinny jeans with back pockets only). I am not sure how the back cover cracked, but I assume it was from me sitting on it all the time. Either way, I can't confirm with cheap back or front glass pieces. I learned my lesson, I will carry it in a shoulder bag from now on :)!
1609611543|5.0|Alright, I'll be upfront here, I went on a low carb regiment awhile ago, and I've gotten great results from it, so I won't fully contribute my weight loss to this book.  Just recently, I got a report however from a newsletter I'm signed up to, talking and praising this book.  So, I figured I'd give it a shot, see what happens, I mean, what the heck right.  I'm doing well, but, the newsletter said, what I don't know about Wheat might be killing me.  I had gone to eating whole wheat when I had carbs thinking those were the healthy carbohydrates to eat, as doctor's have said and nutritionists have told me.  This book opened my eyes to why I feel worn down a lot, to why my body feels like it's been put through a ringer.<br /><br />I'm six days now wheat free and I already have a bit more energy, able to stay up to eleven o'clock compared to falling asleep at eight as I had been doing.  I haven't gotten those mid-afternoon dull periods since the third day I've been wheat free, and coincidentally, that was first day I was back to working, which you'd expect to feel worn down.  Though I have my cravings for carbs, I'm not sure I'll ever want to go back, I feel so great with them.<br /><br />We'll see how it does on my sinuses that always act up in the winter and I'll see if I lose more weight than I'm already losing.  I'll keep everyone posted and edit this in a month or so.  Right now however, Wheat seems to be the culprit for my lack of energy, my slow weight loss for the eating plan I've created, and my general aches and pains, all of which, in the last six days, have seemed to go away.<br /><br />Look, I wouldn't call this book a diet book, and I think a lot of his directions are hard to follow, some of them involve foods I haven't really heard of, and, with latest evidence, organic foods just haven't proven to be better than regular foods.  Again and again reports like that come out, and as a working class individual who struggles to pay the bills every day, I think anyone who puts an emphasis on organic foods does a slight disservice.<br /><br />Nonetheless, great book, buy it.<br /><br />I've really been reading up and reaping the benefits of great books time and time again of late, with more than 14 pounds lost.<br /><br />I'd be remissed if I didn't tell you about [[ASIN:B008YH9S9U The Three Diets Solution: The Proven Methods For Fast and Sustainable Weight Loss]] from which I created much of my weight loss eating plan from, and from which I've lost more than 14 pounds at the moment, and still dropping.  I also learned a lot about the possibilities of a low carb eating plan, along with low fat, and low calories.  It was also the authors newsletter that told me about this book.<br /><br />The critics aren't wrong when they say this is a low carb diet, but, there are far better books that describe low carb eating, I'd recommend, [[ASIN:1439190275 New Atkins for a New You: The Ultimate Diet for Shedding Weight and Feeling Great.]]<br />[[ASIN:0982207786 The Primal Blueprint: Reprogram your genes for effortless weight loss, vibrant health, and boundless energy (Primal Blueprint Series)]]<br />[[ASIN:1451648650 The 17 Day Diet: A Doctor's Plan Designed for Rapid Results]]<br />and if you want to get all the information on why a Low carb diet works and why it won't kill you, which should always be on your list of concerns when planning a diet, check out,<br />[[ASIN:1400033462 Good Calories, Bad Calories: Fats, Carbs, and the Controversial Science of Diet and Health]]<br />or his simpler book<br />[[ASIN:0307474259 Why We Get Fat: And What to Do About It]]

B000TM1CKQ|5.0|This box set series is definitely worth the money. I purchased for my brother as a birthday present. The shipment was so quick and everything was packaged so quickly. Extremely happy with the product.
B004XWLN20|4.0|I really like the casing it is packaged in.  However I think because of the way it is packaged, some of the discs have small scratches on them.  So far only two episodes have been effected by these scratches, the others have not been significant enough.  Other than these scratches, this is a great product!
B005V2EVBQ|1.0|Awful. Do not waste your money on this. It is nothing like the picture, anything like I expected. The quality is poor, the style is poor, the function is poor. All I wanted was an inexpensive cover that would stand up & help alleviate the problem with the on/off switch on the bottom. It was not worth the hassle if returning it and end up paying shipping both ways got nothing! Better to shop in stores rather online for a cover.
B00846REIS|5.0|Bared to You was an incredible book.  I could not put it down.  I don't think I have ever read a book so fast.  I enjoyed 50 Shades and read that Trilogy about 3 times - then found this book and I am so excited for the next book to come out so that I can see what happens with Eva and Gideon - I would definitely recommend this book to anyone that likes romance & sexual situations, but with a plot.
B0077SGMXM|5.0|I love this game, its very addictive and solo many enjoyable levels. It has lots of variation and lots of items to unlock. Plays superbly on my nexus tablet
B004ZRV3AU|4.0|It took a little time for me to actually get the correct technique down- i found it works best when you hold the bottle horizontally and pour the boiling water and freezing cold water over the score line- it pops right off!  But i've done almost 100 wine bottles now and it's still working great!!!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I think there are a few things to be fixed. but I'm so happy they finally made an app. now I have it for when I'm on the go or waiting somewhere
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this app!! The little things you can do on pinterest go a long way!! I don't know what I did before it. my family loves all the things I can create weather it be new recipes or projects. I would really recommend this to anyone who loves to try new things!!!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I don't write reviews for books, but I will on this one. Mark's accounts of what it is to be a Navy SEAL are so engaging that i could not put it down, stayed up to 1 a.m. to finish it. Here is a man that set his goals from childhood and accomplished what he set out to do and be one the best in what the Navy has to offer.  As far as his account of what happend when we went in to kill Osama Bin Laden, it was gripping and if felt like i was in the helicopter with them when it was going down to when they landed back safely at the base with Osama Bin Laden's body. I can understand why he wrote the book after reading how many leaks came out after the raid and how soon. Theses guys are the best we have to offer and for what they do and put themselves in harms way for us i will always be grateful.<br /><br />This is not the first Navy SEAl book I have read, Kris Kyles American Sniper is really good. What these guys do and the code they live by is how we should all live our lives. My opinion is read the book and be thankful we have guys that are willing to do this job, and have familys that support them.
B008602KQI|4.0|First of all, Amazon needs to be recognized for getting the movie to me on release day!! I was expected the movie to come on Monday, two days after the release, so when I got the movie on Saturday I was over the moon with excitement.  Amazon was always good about this with the Harry Potter books too. As for the movie, I loved it because I loved the books. I just wish it was longer and less edited so more from the books could have been included.
015603008X|5.0|this book was great and was in great shape. i recommend everyone to read it because it is very beautiful. great quality too
1439192812|4.0|This seems to be a book more for the masses.  It's not as technical as some of his other work, but it's a good start for someone who needs their eyes opened.
B007TNS6JI|4.0|Great game but less fun than first and second one. Really good for some short time killer. But imo difference between free gear and paid gear is too big. Im also playing rage of bahamut really good and absorbing game. If you try it after tutorial you can enter my referral code: ock58155 it will give you some boost for start and I also will get some profit from it. Have fun :)
B008RA3X5E|1.0|Like other reviewers have said this app was broken in a recent update. At 11:10pm the clock showed 22:21:6sun. The developer clearly needs some better QA before they push out updates. I'll try reinstalling in a week and will update my review but as it stands this app just is non-functional.
B00899F0G8|3.0|This show would make a very interesting whodunit kind of thing..... I think intimate relationships could be left out.... because just the secrets and trying to figure out who is part of this group A is always enough to keep you watching with all the twists and turns.  I personally could careless about the relationship part though, I don't think they are well written....
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love Pinterest and have been unable to enjoy it until I got this app. it does still have some bugs and force closes a lot or just won't open. with that being said I like the app because I do get to use Pinterest more than I would without it. I only have a Kindle Fire no PC, so to be finally able to use Pinterest is a big deal to me. I like it and I wish they would improve it a bit. still 5 stars anyway.
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|this app is soo fricken slow how do u make your money this is rediculous I'm still waiting its been a week

B008JMKN4Y|3.0|This was not the best book but for some reason it was as addicting as crack.  I do not really understand my addiction because I was frustrated a lot through the book.  A. This book has NO detail.  I was confused about the timeline and I don't even know what some of the main characters look like- I have no real understanding of what Abby looks like and Shep and America were barely described if at all. The book also rarely goes into detail about what Abby is thinking or maybe she isn't a deep thinker. B. ABBY - frustrating character- she never  listens to what Travis is saying, and holds on to her tongue instead of being honest or if she is honest it is when she is angry and a bitch and therefore everything is prolonged-Loved America though! C. if you just finished reading fifty shades and/or bared to you like me- then this book will seem like a PG compared to those NC-17- nothing wrong with it but come on, the book is for those over 17 and the book has no foreplay or description - just sex and it doesn't even seem like Abby enjoys it.  At least with bared to you and fifty shades the ladies were taken care of.  BUT. this book was so addicting, I had school work to do and it was distracting me- I am going to re-read it.  I do agree with some of the other reviews, I love love love the beginning and the middle was frustrating (can not wait for Travis POV on the middle), and the end seemed rushed- in a way she could have made another book - focused on the details, and prolonged the ending into something better.  I will read walking disaster and I think it will be much better through Travis' pov.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I love this Bible app! I appreciate the many different translations available to choose from. There are also many different reading plans that help one focus on certain topics or simply to guide your study of the Bible. These are helpful and can generate some deep thought. Overall, love the app!
B00006AW2J|3.0|CD case broken although shipment packaging was intact and uncrushed - I question how \\"new\\" item actually was on arrival
B007SGM084|5.0|I vowed that I did not want to read this series, it was said to be poorly written (and it was in badly need of a thesaurus) and I wasn't interested in it just for the erotic sex but my best friend said I needed to give it a chance.  I read all three in five days, the story was so touching although I will admit that I had to skip over some of the sex scenes because they became so redundant that it was boring. Ana was wise beyond her years and it was great, so glad I didn't skip this one!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Read in one day, I guess many people have their 9/11 experiences I had mine too. Kudos to the professionals for getting the job done and providing a closure. I don't think book reveals any secrets nor it is political. It is written by a professional guy and why not when bunch of idiots leak things in DC and media speculates about everything the guy just wrote an honest account without compromising any national security interest.<br /><br />Finished in few hours!
B0061S073A|5.0|I this the app is wonderful. my 3 yr old son knows right where to go for his fun and I don't have to worry he going places I don't want him to go
B007IXWKUK|3.0|I am somewhat disppointed thus far in the books. They seem to be juvenile in their presentation. Of course we are reading on to see what happens, but overall I have read much better books in the past.
B008DW6VOQ|4.0|This app gives me everything I need to keep track of my stocks!  I highly recommend this app for its ease of use!
B006LSZECO|2.0|When I read the last page of this book, I actually said out loud \\"that's it?\\" I was very disappointed, it was almost like she got tired of writing or telling the story and just stopped.  Maybe it's me, but I turned off my Kindle thinking that I missed something, perhaps I did.
B00899EOIS|4.0|I really wanted to catch up on my show but could not find them any where for free so I was very happy to be able to purchase these episodes to get caught up on. they were easy to purchase and easy to watch.
B0086700CM|5.0|I've seen a lot of positive and negative reviews about this game. I for one side with the positive. But don't take anyone's word for it. Think it's worth trying? Then get it. If not, let it pass you by. But know that not all games are for every one.
B0052RDHTM|2.0|I was dissappointed in the book in general. It started well but then tended to be political theme . I will not recommed this to anyone nor will I rerad the rest of his trilogy
B002PEP4C8|5.0|While I can't say I loved the subject of this book (rape & violence) I'm glad I read it.  It is an excellent book and well-written.  The book was upsetting in the fact that it was true.  It set off a lot of buried feelings in me.  I am always amazed and impressed by women who go through things like this and come out whole on the other side.  There often seems to be an underlying unfairness about the way rape victims are treated by law enforcement and some members of society.  I read the book in one session, as I couldn't put it down.<br /><br />This is Alice Sebold's story and I admire her bravery in sharing it with the rest of us.  I would recommend this book to anyone mature enough to understand the subject matter.  There are probably some teens who would be able to appreciate and learn from it.  Others may be too young, so I would suggest parental guidance.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|I'm going to have to write another review after I do the workout/diet program described in the book so I can share my results.  However,  I bought this book without knowing it contained a specific program/blueprint that anyone could just follow.  I bought this book because I've always wondered how the body takes food and turns it into energy or muscle.  What is insulin?  What are high glycemic carbs?  I've read plenty of articles that touch base on these things but they always left me confused and missing the overall picture.  THIS BOOK SOLVES THAT PROBLEM.  It provides a simple, comprehensive look on how the human body interacts with different foods, lives, and grows... additionally (and more obviously) specific things you can do to take control of that process.<br /><br />I loved this book.  I'm doing some long distance cardio until November which would severely hinder any bulking, but after that I plan to put these methods to the test and write another review with my results.<br /><br />-Alan Cherney<br />29yr. old marathoner dad
B0050PYNP8|5.0|Awesome movie features a lot of funny people in it from other good comedy movies, different type of plot so its good, a lot of ALIEN type tributes to a lot of other movies STAR WARS, E.T., Ect VERY COOL MOVIE WORTH BUYING!
B008O69SZ0|4.0|Another solid offering from Ian Hunter, clever lyrics and well-crafted melodies. Nice performances and arrangements. By all rights you should expect music this good from someone far younger, but I guess Hunter is giving credence to the concept of learned craftsmanship.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I know it is probably silly to review a CD, but I just LOVED WICKED so much when I watched it live I had to own the album.  I received this CD yesterday, and popped it into my cd player when I got into my car.  It took me about an hour to get home in stressful traffic, but I didn't care, because I was reliving every moment of this fabulous musical (goose bumps & all) with this fabulous cd.  If you love Wicked, or if you just love good music from incredibly talented singers, this CD is amazing!
B007V4LKRU|5.0|Off the top, I want to comment on the production, as that seems to be more polarizing than ever. Bottom line: it is straight-up 21st century. If you don't like modern production values, if you believe there was some golden age of audio 30 years ago and as such can't hear songs for the sonics, this one's not for you. That said, the production is (in uncompressed formats) clear, meaty, and driving. Also delicate when needed. To my ear, there is plenty of dynamic range, and the band sounds more \\"live\\" then they have in years. The drums sound like real drums, the guitar's actually more focused and less layered than on the last couple albums, and the bass is pitch perfect, fat and rumbling but also clear, with plenty of mid-punch; when Alex drops out for a solo, you don't even notice the rhythm guitar missing. Which is quite a feat. Yes, this is mastered louder, per current standards, but it doesn't digitally clip like 'Vapor Trails.'<br /><br />Production technicalities aside, what we have here is that rarest of albums, one that can easily stand alongside the band's \\"classic\\" releases. Haven't seen a band pull that off since Iron Maiden's 'A Matter Of Life And Death,' back in 2006. Rush even surpasses their own legacy in some ways, as there is an element of maturity here that would have been impossible 30 years ago. The songs are for the most part uniformly strong, with even the slightly weaker ones (\\"Halo Effect\\" and \\"Wish You Well\\") being buoyed up by the conceptual tapestry surrounding them. At the same time, Peart has given us a batch of songs that (for the most part) can stand on their own absent knowledge of the concept.<br /><br />Speaking of that concept: whether intentional or not, 'Clockwork Angels' is something of a sequel to '2112,' thematically if nothing else. Different protagonist, different backdrop, different plot development, but the same notion of the individual pitted against an overarching system that thinks it knows what's best. He struggles, learns, finds, loses, and then finds hope again. But whereas '2112' was the band's furious reply to the idea that they needed to compromise to survive, 'Clockwork Angels' is an examination of where you are when the dust has settled, when you've been through the best and worst life has to offer. '2112' asked this question as well, but the answer was one of conjecture, one of howling, suicidal escape rather than capitulation. 'Clockwork,' on the other hand, is a story of just how much a person CAN survive, and ultimately, in \\"Headlong Flight,\\" sees its protagonist proclaim, \\"I wish that I could live it all again.\\" All. Not just the good parts. Which is hugely relevant, both to the fictional storyline and what lyricist/drummer Neil Peart has lived through in his real life. The album ends with \\"Wish Them Well,\\" a surprisingly turn-the-other-cheek response to those who would wear you down via relentless negativity, and \\"The Garden,\\" a gorgeous closing meditation on the need to tend to one's own sense of meaning and satisfaction. \\"Happiness is where you find it\\" becomes \\"happiness is where you grow it.\\" A far cry (reference intended) from slitting your wrists just as the elder race shows up to save you.<br /><br />But, before we get to closure, we get the fury of beginnings. And there is plenty of that anger, albeit not as scathing as '2112's onslaught. \\"Caravan\\" kicks off the proceedings, establishing both the main character's motivation and the band as a still-towering paragon of musicianship and chemistry. The main riff and chorus are great, but its the instrumental bridge section that really lets us know Rush is back in a way we haven't seen in awhile. Much like \\"Show Don't Tell\\" some 20+ years ago, the song gets its melodic hooks in you and then lets the band loose for a good two minutes in the middle. Tight, punchy, borderline-funk riffs, capped off with a daringly atonal guitar solo from Alex Lifeson.<br /><br />Next is the album's heaviest track, lyrically and musically: \\"BU2B (Brought Up To Believe).\\" An attack on the fictional plot's Watchmaker, an attack on pre-determination, on the enemies of free will...an attack even on God, if you choose to read it as such; \\"BU2B\\" imagines an overlord who \\"loves us all to death,\\" and the band backs it up with verse slabs of down-tuned guitar, juxtaposed against an unexpected 'Grace Under Pressure'-esque bridge.<br /><br />From there we hit the title track, the album's promised epic. And while it doesn't quite live up to the hype that it would be a multi-parter in the vein of \\"Natural Science,\\" \\"Clockwork Angels\\" still stands as the band's longest, most varied song since 1981's \\"The Camera Eye.\\" Characterized throughout by a rolling 6/8 (or swing, depending on how you look at it) feel, the song moves through a series of moods with great efficacy, with another great Lifeson solo and even a lyric lifted from an In 'N Out Burger shake cup. This song also brings me to another point of contention regarding this album: Geddy's vocal melodies. They make this song. I've seen a lot of reviews claim his voice is shot, and that there are no real melodies on the album. I couldn't disagree more; while its true that his range isn't what it once was (and hasn't been since 1980, really), the melodies on this album are incredible. Very complex and varied, much moreso than the early years, but absolutely there. I half wonder if the confusion stems from people WANTING simpler melodies. There is some legitimacy to this, in that the simpler melodies of yesteryear were a significant part of what helped make Rush's otherwise complex and sometimes downright bizarre music more accessible, but for the purposes of this album, I think the busier lines work perfectly, revealing themselves almost exponentially on repeat listens.<br /><br />Moving on, we hit \\"The Anarchist\\" and \\"Carnies,\\" the former executing a clever bassline-that-becomes-vocal-line trick and featuring another riff that hearkens back to the chorused-out80s, and the latter doing a pinch-harmonic take on what could be a rhythmic reference to \\"Working Man.\\" Nowhere near as blatant as the \\"Bastille Day\\" tag in \\"Headlong Flight,\\" but still arguably there. Lyrically, both songs serve to back our protagonist into a corner as he is manipulated by one of the story's villains, though \\"The Anarchist\\" also sees a perhaps embittered version of 2112's hero lamenting a world where there was never \\"time enough to sing that song.\\" Its the guitar being smashed at Syrinx all over, but with a different character outcome. \\"I never wanted to belong/I was so strong,\\" he proclaims, the eternal mantra of the outsider who decides to hate the world before it can hate him.<br /><br />\\"Halo Effect\\" is the album's first soft spot, and would be something of a throw-away if it didn't serve as a bridge to the rest of the story. While not a bad song, it doesn't have much variation and comes across more as an interlude than a stand-alone piece. The song it leads into is another of the record's epics, \\"Seven Cities Of Gold.\\" Reportedly equally influenced by Cormac McCarthy and the Spanish myth of lost North American cities of gold, the song opens with a straight-ahead riff that wouldn't have been out of place on 'Fly By Night.' This is a solid, satisfying song, though it plods a bit in comparison to the preceding heavies (and also sends the story off on a something of a lyrical tangent).<br /><br />This brings us to \\"The Wreckers,\\" a story of murderers who causes deliberate shipwrecks for the purpose of plunder. This song to me is more significant for the light it sheds on Peart's current philosophy than it is for its place in the narrative. For the most part a ballad, it features a beautiful chorus where the the protagonist laments \\"All I know is sometimes you have to be wary of a miracle too good to be true...Because sometimes the target is you,\\" and ultimately that \\"sometimes memory can be too much to carry / Striking down like a bolt from the blue.\\" One of the album's most powerful moments, without a doubt.<br /><br />And then we get to where I started, \\"Headlong Flight.\\" A rollicking, 7-minute barn-burner, with the already-mentioned \\"Bastille Day\\" reference front-and-center, this song is as close to pre-'2112' Rush as we are ever going to hear, ever. Featuring a spiraling, Tool-ish opening bass riff, absolutely ferocious drumming (including a fullblown solo), and a wah-drenched Lifeson shredfest that really could have been airlifted in from 1974, this is the band giving it all they've still got on the straight-up attack front. And of course, tied together with Geddy's belting of that great line, \\"I wish that I could live it all again!\\"<br /><br />In closing, I think Rush have made an album for the ages, one that I'd be as comfortable giving a new listener to the band as a starting point as I would, say, 'Permanent Waves.' Perhaps the most successful group to ever have its fanbase defined predominantly by those who want to see their favorite band evolve with each release, Rush have made good on that promise, consistently, for almost four decades, and Clockwork Angels not only is no exception, but, should this be the last go-around, will serve brilliantly as a summation. It is also, for all its conceptual grandiosity, possibly the most lyrically personal album in the band's catalog. Neil Peart doesn't give many interviews, and when he does, his personal tragedies are explicitly not touched upon. And while I respect that, particularly in that he hasn't given in to the current memoir culture of misery voyeurism, its been hard not to wonder how such events affect a mind so given to exploration of ultimate meaning as Peart's. This isn't to say the world isn't full of people who have suffered as much or more, but rarely are they in a position of similar intelligence, eloquence, and public exposure; I contend the man's two-cents on these matters bears more resemblance to gold doubloons than actual pennies.<br /><br />Lastly, Geddy and Alex. Neither has lost an ounce in instrumental ability: if anything, Geddy is more fluid than ever, and Lifeson's solos are still exercises in a glorious sort of transcendental freneticism. Geddy's voice has lost some range, and he has trouble keeping up vocally live, night after night, for three hours at a pop, but he sounds great on this album. If this is to be Rush's final album, let it be said they went out bringing the same intelligent fire that put them on the map in the first place, way back when their first A&R man said, \\"I don't hear a single,\\" and three guys from Willowdale responded: \\"We Have Assumed Control.\\"<br /><br />(Lastly lastly: a note on format. This album sounds far and away the best on vinyl. If that's too cumbersome, definitely track it down lossless (FLAC, wav, ALAC, or on good ol' CD); it does get a little brittle in compressed formats like MP3. Still plenty listenable at 320k, especially in a car or in the background, but for the full experience, you're gonna want all them wavelengths intact. Matter of fact, I half wonder if a good chunk of the people who don't like the album's sound have only heard it compressed; that's becoming more and more common, I'm sad to say.)
B000RW3VD4|5.0|Yet another movie that I would watch bits and pieces of on cable--before finally getting around to viewing in its entirety--Oliver Stone's Wall Street is one of the finest movies, arguably the finest, that I have ever seen.<br /><br />--Spoilers Ahead--<br /><br />Wall Street opens beautifully with montages of Manhattan \\"waking up\\" to a golden, sunny morning--Frank Sinatra singing in the back ground. How can you beat that? It stars Charlie Sheen as Bud Fox (youthful; growing/sly as a), a young twenty-something who has chosen to by-pass law school in the hopes of making it big on Wall Street.<br /><br />Working at Jackson Steinham & Co., Fox spends his workdays cold-calling potential clients (Fox has a list of wealthy doctors, lawyers, etc--and \\"cold-calls\\" them, out of the blue, hoping to sell them huge blocks of stock which he believes will be the \\"next big thing\\").<br /><br />Oh yeah, there is another thing Bud does every workday: he calls up the already legendary Wall Street \\"player,\\" Gordon Gekko (lizard), portrayed by one of my favorite actors: Michael Douglas.<br /><br />Bud is hoping to get \\"just ten minutes of\\" Gekko's time. After yet another turn-down, he laments to his co-worker pal Marv (John C. McGinley), that one day he wants to be the guy on the other end of that phone. \\"Don't we all,\\" Marv replies, adding that \\"the Gekkos don't talk to the nobodies such as us.\\"<br /><br />Fortunately (or unfortunately) Bud isn't one to easily be dissuaded.<br /><br />On Gordon Gekko's birthday, Bud, handsome young man that he is, charms his way through Gekko's office--and personal secretary--and manages to get himself a meeting with Gekko. It doesn't hurt that he has brought along a birthday present: some Havana cigars (Gordon's favorites).<br /><br />Before entering Gordon's immense, intimidating inner sanctum, Fox adjusts his tie, takes a very deep breath, and says: \\"Life comes down to a few moments--this is one of them.\\"<br /><br />He then proceeds to totally messup. Having initially impressed Gekko with his persistence, he stammers on about being \\"a fan\\" and tries to sell him on some boring, going absolutely nowhere, stocks. Sensing that he is about to blow the whole deal, Bud lets slip some insider information: Bluestar Airlines is about to win a lawsuit and is in the process of setting itself up to become a major player in the airline industry. His father, Carl, played by real-life father, Martin Sheen, has given him this information innocently--Carl Fox is the chief mechanic, and union rep, at Bluestar.<br /><br />Gekko pounces on this information and uses it to his HUGE advantage. He also decides to use Bud for his own personal advantage, too. Seducing him with dreams of wealth, power, drugs and beautiful women--one in particular, interior designer Darien Taylor (Daryl Hannah)--whom Bud falls head-over-heels for--Gekko gets Bud to secure insider information for him...particularly inside information concerning one Sir Lawrence Wildman (Terence Stamp)--a corporate raider with a lot more wealth and power than Gekko, himself.<br /><br />It seems Sir Larry stole a pharmaceutical company out from GG's nose a (not too long) while back. Gordon loathes him.<br /><br />Bud is quite successful in his role. He does gain some insider info that Gekko is able to use to \\"hurt\\" Wildman (more embarrass than hurt, actually, but I digress...). Bud also gets a promotion at work--including his own office; a new, luxurious apartment on Manhattan's Upper East Side; and fantastic sex every night with his new, gorgeous \\"girlfriend\\" (actually, Darien Taylor is yet just another one of Gordon Gekko's pawns).<br /><br />Bud even decides to help make his old law school friend, Roger Barnes (James Spader) rich with his newfound knowledge--all the while trying to gain inside information from him, too!<br /><br />Yeah, Bud has completely gone off of the deep end....and it all starts to crash down around him.<br /><br />Bud wants Gordon to gain control of Bluestar Airlines and let him (Bud) run it. Gordon, however, wants to trash the airline and soak all the remaining stock money out of it that he can.  To Bud's face, he goes along with his plan (while all the time twisting the knife).<br /><br />Even worse, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is starting to get wise to Bud's schemes. They start \\"sniffing around\\" Bud so much that Roger Barnes tells him to stay away.<br /><br />The worst, however, hits when Carl (at a Bluestar/Gekko/Bud meeting) tells Bud (in front of Gekko, no less) that the whole \\"benevolent takeover\\" is a fraud--and even if it isn't, how does \\"working summers in baggage\\" qualify Bud to be Bluestar's president? This leads to a father/son blow-up, and shortly afterwards Carl suffers a (non-fatal) heart attack.<br /><br />In addition to his father's heart attack, Bud has also (now) found out about Gordon's betrayal; his relationship with Darien ends when she refuses to stand with him against Gekko; (and) he is forced to sell his apartment.<br /><br />In a great scene, a world-weary Bud Fox, realizing what he has (or almost has) become, leans against a tree in downtown New York. A tree that is the only \\"real\\" thing, amid a fantasy world of kitsch and glamor, that has supported him in the past few fantastic, wonderful, and ultimately horrible, months. Great job of symbolism here by director Oliver Stone.<br /><br />Bud hatches a scheme to save Bluestar. Turning to Larry Wildman of all people, he gets him to agree to save Bluestar in exchange for an iron-clad contactual promise he won't destroy it. Wildman buys up all of Bluestar's stock, right from under Gekko's nose, and gains a (quite) financially viable airline, while at the same time making Gordon Gekko look like a fool.<br /><br />Yes, (Sir) Larry Wildman wins.<br /><br />Bud does not.<br /><br />Gekko sells out Bud Fox to the SEC, and he gets arrested--at work, of all places, and is humiliated in front of everyone. However, Bud then proceeds to \\"sell out\\" (if you can call it that) Gordon Gekko, wearing a wire and getting GG to admit to his illegal ways of doing business. Gekko will have to ultimately settle for a couple of (well-placed) punches to Bud Fox's face as the only \\"victory\\" he is going to claim in this movie. He is about to go to jail. For a very long time.<br /><br />Bud is, too, but at least it won't be for long--most likely, less than a year. Driven to the courthouse by his parents, Carl tells Bud that \\"maybe this is for the best.\\" That now Bud can get the foolishness out of his life and go on from here to make something of himself. The real--not the fantasy--way.<br /><br />The movie ends with Bud Fox walking up the courthouse on a gray, dreary, winterish day. Great shot; even greater symbolism.<br /><br />My thoughts on this fantastic movie in a moment, but let me first go over the dvd's<br /><br />Special Features<br /><br />Disc One--The dvd contains an excellent commentary track by director Oliver Stone. It is literally Film-making 101 for any aspiring, would-be, directors out there. And, it is highly entertaining in its own right. If you like this movie, you owe it to yourself to watch it at least once with the commentary own. Stone gives away a wealth of added information to go along with your (regular movie) viewing experience.<br /><br />Disc Two--There are two excellent documentaries found here. One is entitled Money Never Sleeps-The Making of Wall Street. The other  is Greed is Good. Both documentaries add even more to your viewing experience. Money goes into great detail about WS's casting: Michael Douglas was not the first choice for the role of Gordon Gekko--Warren Beatty and Richard Gere were the actors first considered for the part. The fact that Wall Street was released shortly after the Stock Market Crash of 1987, was in no way an attempt to capitalize on tragedy. Stone discusses that the movie had already been show and had its release date set well before Black Monday occurred.<br /><br />Greed is Good talks about the movie's themes and touches on the fact that Gordon Gekko is actually considered a role model for many aspiring Wall Street players. The documentary contains interviews with several real-life Wall Street players, and they discuss why and how the fictional character of Gordon Gekko inspired them to do what they are doing (or hope to be doing). Is Gordon Gekko really an evil person? This is discussed in lengthy detail.<br /><br />There are also deleted scenes and a nice movie introduction by Oliver Stone, himself.<br /><br />My Thoughts<br /><br />*To begin, the movie is excellent. As I already have said, it is arguably the best movie I have ever seen--it is definitely on the short list. I should add that I have never had any interest in the stock market, MBAs, or business, itself...at least, no interest in pursuing any kind of career at all in this field. Yet, this is one of my favorite movies--so that in itself speaks volumes of what an excellent, entertaining movie this is.<br /><br />*Please allow me to also add that the first time I showed this movie to my fiancee--an artist, with no interest in business, either--as soon as the film was over, she pulled Disc Two out and watched both of its documentaries. She liked this movie that much!<br /><br />*I love the \\"feel\\" of this movie. It screams New York, Manhattan and the 1980s all over. I love this. While this movie should not be defined as a \\"1980s movie\\" it does excellently capture...from the hair, to the fashions...to the everything...just the entire essence of the 1980s in the City. Again, I love this!<br /><br />*Gordon Gekko has some great quotes:<br /><br />(Speaking about a rival) \\"The guy is such a loser, if he owned funeral parlors, nobody would die!\\"<br /><br />\\"Greed is good.\\"  The film's iconic line. This line is delivered at a stockholder's meeting that Gordon Gekko, along with Bud and Darien, attends. Gekko is in the process of taking this company over, and in front of the large assembly, he totally humiliates the company's president (Richard Dysart-the \\"funeral parlor guy\\"), whose only response is to call Gekko \\"greedy\\" and \\"out of line.\\"  Gekko responds with a discourse on how we live by our own greed for things in life: love (which is ironic, considering just a few scenes earlier he told Darien that he and she were too smart to believe in \\"anything such as love\\"), wealth, happiness...and concludes with, \\"Greed, for lack of a better term, is good.\\"<br /><br /> \\"If you want a friend, get a dog.\\"<br /><br />(Hysterically angry after learning he has been \\"betrayed\\"--he does not yet know it is Bud who betrayed him) \\"I will tear his eyeballs out. I will suck his f***ing skull!\\"<br /><br />Wow.<br /><br />And, not so much a quote, but early on in the film GG gives Bud an ultimatum: you are either with me (as a industrial spy) or not. Fox bites, and Gordon Gekko, peering out through the open window of his limousine, gives the most wickedly evil and charming smile you could ever hope to see.<br /><br />*You do know, don't you, that Michael Douglas won the 1987 Academy Award for Best Actor for his portrayal of Gordon Gekko? I thought so.<br /><br />*Not so much a \\"thought\\" but I want to mention that this movie's excellent cast also includes: Sean Young, Franklin Cover, Saul Rubinek, Tamara Tunie and Hal Holbrook as Lou Mannheim.<br /><br />Mannheim, based on Oliver Stone's father, works with Bud Fox at Jackson Steinham & Co. and provides reason and conscience (along with Carl Fox) to Bud throughout the movie. In particular, right before Bud is arrested by the SEC, he pulls Bud aside and tells him (putting his arm around him) that he \\"likes him.\\" And that: \\"Man looks in the abyss. There's nothing staring back at him. At that moment, man finds his character, and that is what keeps him out of the abyss.\\"<br /><br />*It is nice to see this movie's \\"wisdom\\" come from Bud's father and Mr. Mannheim. Two \\"Everyman\\" type characters--and not the characters with all of the wealth and power.<br /><br />Finally<br /><br />An irony of this movie is that, while Gekko is the \\"villain\\" and Wildman is the \\"hero\\" who helps save the day...their roles could easily be reversed. Gekko has, no doubt, bought businesses in the past--to rebuild--and will no doubt (once he gets out of jail) do so again in the future.  Wildman, has bought (and--I'm certain--will continue to do so) businesses simply to shut them down.  He's also played fast and loose with the rules--he stole the aforementioned pharmaceutical company from Gekko by bribing one of GG's secretaries for inside info.  The difference between these two men is: Gekko, in this movie, does not have any qualms in using/seducing Bud Fox to do his bidding.  Whether Wildman would do the same...well, we aren't told.<br /><br />Furthermore, I do believe that Gordon Gekko's character does like Bud Fox. I believe GG sees a younger version of himself. Perhaps he sees his own youthful self--before he became corrupt--and deep-down likes that...who knows?<br /><br />Finally, I do not, as some apparently do, see Wall Street as anti-American, or even anti-capitalism. It does rail against capitalism out-of-control: \\"Greed is good,\\" etc, etc. And, I do agree with this particular sentiment, which reminds me of Theodore Dreiser's short story, A Deal in Wheat. However, anything taken to the extreme level is certainly never, ever good...and, considering capitalism is our system--I am glad we have warnings such as this out there, firmly in place. It is not right to profit off of the misfortunes of others. That is, in my estimation, what this movie is about: a condemnation of a particular form of capitalism, but certainly not anti-American propaganda.<br /><br />If only this film was required viewing for all of our elected officials.<br /><br />Thank you for reading.<br /><br />Wall Street<br /><br />Released in 1987 by 20th Century Fox; Directed by Oliver Stone<br /><br />126 minutes; Rated R for strong language, drug usage, sexual situations and nudity.<br /><br />Written by Oliver Stone and Stanley Weiser<br /><br />The (excellent) music in this movie is by The Police's Stewart Copeland.<br /><br />Disc Specs: LANGUAGE (AUDIO) ENGLISH 4.0 DOLBY SURROUND/5.1 DOLBY SURROUND/FRENCH MONO/SPANISH MONO/WIDESCREEN 1.85:1/SUBTITLES ENGLISH/SPANISH/CLOSED CAPTIONED/COLOR/DUAL LAYER/1987/126 MINUTES
