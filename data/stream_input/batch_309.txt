0671027344|5.0|The first thing i wonder when reading negative reviews of this chbosky's novel is always, 'What happened to these people to make them forget what it was like to actually feel your experiences?' Before we became jaded and stopped looking everything in our lives was like it was for the narrator Charlie. Back when things were still new to us and we experienced each event as if it could be our last I like think there was a little bit of Charlie in all of us. And while yes, Charlie does go through a rather extensive list of firsts: love, wet-dream, suicide, masturbation, girlfriend, broken heart, loss of innocence, homosexuality, abortion, abusive relationships, etc., it's fiction. But we all at one point or another in our lives had to deal with betray your sisters trust because you love her or if you keep her unhealthy secret because you love her. And music was all new, just once, and it was ours because we were the ones listening to it. And we watched and learned with our friends that life isn't always fair. In another authors hands this book would have had the false sincerity of Dawson's Creek episode. But no one in this book has all the answers, because we sure didn't. And because of all this, reading this book is almost like having a best friend get nostaligic on you. Because these experiences are so believable, it's not to claim them as your own. But we all had drives in pick-up's through tunnels with \\"Landslide\\" playing as our best friend drove, and our other best friend/true love stood with her dress waving in the wind, as we all just felt the safety of knowing that we were with one another. Driving use to be a big deal at one point. And this book reminds us of all these things in an almost lyrical way. The Sound and the Fury is my vote for best book ever written, but this is my favorite book ever written.
B000002C1W|4.0|...This may not be the best Floyd album ever, but its pretty damn good!  Learning to Fly and The Turning Away are surely not my favorites.  But, One Slip and Sorrow are GREAT songs.  My favorite part of the album is what is billed as Terminal Frost (the instrumental interlude) between The New Machine parts I &amp; II.  I know that I have never heard a more tentative approach to hope in any other album.  It is hope surrounded by darkness.<br />If for no other reason, this is one of my fave Floyd albums.  Dust it off, turn off the lights and give it another listen...
B00008J4P5|5.0|This is a great album.  I don't know if it will be a true classic, but it's one of the best things to come out in a good long while.  The big thing to note is that you can tell the group poured their heart, sweat and tears into this record.  My taste in music is generally much harder (Jane's Addiction, Ministry, Zeppelin, etc.) but there is real emotion in the music.  This is what you get when you make an \\"A\\" effort.  Too much music is just B+ (good enough) lately.    (That's why music sales are down, music industry people!!!)<br />Listen to \\"There's No Home For You Here\\" and \\"Ball and Biscuit\\" to hear Jack being a guitar hero.  He's not Hendrix in skills, but he's closer to George Harrison - meaning -  by playing just what's needed and not much more.  \\"In the Cold, Cold, Night\\" isn't a masterpiece, but it's easy to imagine Meg's singing it just to you.  <br />Take the album as a whole.  No song is overly great nor is there any \\"throw-away\\" title, but there's a great consistent emotional involvement with the band all the way through - and that's refreshing to hear.
0671027387|5.0|It's definitely not high brow literature, but I love this book anyway!  It is a very fast read, a good thing since I couldn't put it down and stayed up late two nights finishing it.  The plot can best be described as a mystery military sci-fi thriller, which means you will probably love it if you are into those sorts of books.  And, according to the first few pages of the book, &quot;the organizations and technologies described in this book are real&quot;... which had me looking out onto my deck every now and then and wondering if I would see a black clad Delta force operative with a night vision scope...
B00008DDXC|5.0|The magic is back and is the story is bigger and better than the first.  The special effects have become better and so has the acting.  Harry has returned to Hogwarts against the advice of Doby the elf.  Ron and Herminoe are back to and so is Malfoy causing all sorts of trouble. <br /> The sequel introduces more characters including Malfoy's father and Doby.  The one character that is under used is Robbie Coltrane who is excellent as Hargid but doesnt get a lot of screen time.  The story may be a little compilcated for younger children who have never read the books or seen the first film but will easily catch up because Harry seems to repeat everything thats said to him. <br />The second disc of the dvd is good for younger children and should keep them entertained for a few hours but for the older children they may become bored farly quickly.  Compared to the dvd extras from from the first film there are a lot fewer and makes this second disc a bit of a let down as there are no interviews with the director and writers just J.K Rowilng and a few 2 minute chats with the main memebers of the cast.
B000002UB3|2.0|George Harrison saves this otherwise mediocre effort of Lennon/McCartney by writing the two best songs on the album, Something and Here Comes the Sun.  Without these we are left with the mediocre (Come Together, Oh Darling, I Want You), the silly (Octopuses Garden, Maxwell's Silver Hammer), and the incomplete but pasted together fare of Polythene Pam, Bathroom Window, Mr. Mustard.<br />Interesting to note that George not only had the two best songs on Abbey Road, but the best song on the White Album (While My Guitar Gently Weeps), Revolver (Taxman), Rubber Soul (If I Needed Someone) and With The Beatles (Don't Bother Me). <br />No surprise that George's first solo effort &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; was so much better than Paul's &quot;McCartney&quot; or John's &quot;Plastic Ono Band&quot;.<br />As for Abbey Road, I've framed the cover, but no longer play the CD.  Too dated.
B00005B6N7|1.0|Here we go again, Hollywood stealing the history of another nation and passing it off as their own. It amazes me that Hollywood feels the need to steal the history of other nations when there are many untold stories of American WW2 success that could be told instead. This doesn't just insult the British (who actually captured the enigma machine before America even joined the war), but it's also an insult to the Americans to have Hollywood try to pass this off as American history, not to mention an insult to both the American and British military personnel who actually fought this terrible war. ...
B00008DDRX|4.0|I've been waiting 3 years for this DVD, since the first time I had seen this film.  'Le Mans' has stood the test of time to be considered one of the great racing films ever made.  There are many failures, including recent ones like 'Days of Thunder' and 'Driven'.  The minimalist plot doesn't take away from the incredible racing footage, and McQueen captured one of the most exciting eras in racing, as Porsche battled Ferrari with V-12 monster cars.<br />I'm a little dissappointed that there is no additional commentary or documentaries included with the DVD.  Chad McQueen hosted an excellent 'Making of Le Mans' that could have easily been included.  But the film itself can finally be seen as it was over 30 years ago in the theater: chrystal clear, widescreen, and Dolby surround sound. Grab a copy, you won't be disappointed.
B00008LDPU|1.0|If logic had anything to do with hollywood you might expect that if you liked the Matrix you will like the Animatrix.  Wrong!!!  Unlike the Matrix, the Animatrix is collection of short anime's (to short to hold your your attention, let alone remember them to recamend to a friend).  The animation itself isn't bad,  infact it's pretty good,  the problem is, that the only thing they are showing is naked chicks and these fake looking robots that could come straight from an H. G. well's production!  It's sad, really, because the Matrix appealed to so many people,  unlike the Animatrix which will only appeal to adolescents wanting some cheap thrills.
B000002WYT|5.0|Crash was the first DMB cd I purchased, and I've been hooked on their music ever since.  It is fully worth purchasing DMB cds because all of them can be listened to straight through in complete enjoyment.  The music featured in DMB's Crash sounds so great ultimately because of its many elements, compiled into one jazzy, folk-rock sound.  Crash is such a good cd also because the song lyrics are all about enjoying life, and living life to its fullest.  I definitely recommend Crash, as well as DMB's Under the Table and Dreaming, featuring much of the same sound.  DMB's other cds are a little more jazzy-sounding, some others more folk-based, but are just as great, nonetheless.  The live cds are also great because they offer different versions of everyone's studio-recorded favourites.  All in all, Crash is my favourite cd in particular because it includes a collection of upbeat songs fully illustrating DMB's musical talent and diversity.
B000089RVX|5.0|This is a fantastic cd with cool beats, fast-paced songs, and good lyrics.  My favorite songs are Bring Me To Life, My Immortal, and Haunted.  Bring Me To Life is a totally awesome song with some added rap.  My Immortal is a beautiful song with meaningful lyrics.  Haunted is fast-paced with a good beat, and you can get the meaning of this song from the title.  Fallen by Evanescence is definitely worth getting!  I'd recommend it.
B00003CX8J|3.0|The \\"X-Men\\" movie had to make a lot of changes from the comic book to make it more acceptable to the general public.  In the orginal comic book, the X-men get their powers, because their parents were exposed to atomic raditation.  For example, Sunfire became a superpowered mutant because his mother was in Hiroshima when the bomb went off.  Soon after she gave birth to Sunfire, and then she died.  In contrast; the movie \\"The Conqueror\\" (1956), starring John Wayne, was filmed downwind of above ground atomic tests in Nevada and Utah.  About 70% of the people associated with this movie died of cancer.  There were no reports of superpowered mutant children being born afterwards.  Also, Mystique was an enemy of Ms. Mar-vel.  Mystigue tried to kill Ms. Mar-vel, then she murdered Dr. Michael Barrett, a friend of Ms. Mar-vel.  Then Rogue, an ally of Mystique tried to murder Ms. Mar-vel and in the process Rogue gained Ms. Mar-vel's super powered ablities.  Carol Danvers, (Ms. Mar-vel),  survived to become Binary and then Warbird.  Rogue left Mystique, because Ms. Mar-vel's memories were overwhelming her, and then she went to the X-Men seeking help for her condition.  In the movie, the X-Men get their powers from their genes, not from raditation, and there is no metion of Sunfire or Ms. Mar-vel.  Rogue and Mystique have no prior relationship with one another in the movie.                        As far as the movie goes, it tries to compare prejudice between regular humans, and superpowered mutants to other types of racism based on skin color, or religion, and I feel that is overreaching. The film has a scene set at a WWII death camp and I think that including it was tasteless in the extreme.  Most Marvel comic books are set in New York City; will we get a Marvel superpowered person movie that includes scenes of 9-11-01 in it?  I hope not!  The film is okay as far as acting, photography, dialoge, and special effects for a movie based on a comic book, but, I wish Patrick Stewartand most of the others could find a film more worthy of their obvious talents.  In comparison to other comic book movies; \\"Superman I\\" and \\"II\\" were the best, followed by the \\"Batman\\" movies with Michael Keaton, then \\"Spiderman\\" with Toby McGuire, and \\"X-Men\\".  I did not see \\"Daredevil\\" with Ben Affeck, about a totally BLIND superhero!  I do recommend \\"X-Men\\" as it is a good, not great film.
B00005JLRT|4.0|The darker Treks are by far the most superior of Star Trek. When I look at these types of Trek I usually see what Trek should have been on TNG (on TV), Voyager, and Enterprise could have been and should be. These \\"dark Treks\\" are Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country, parts of Star Trek Generations, Star Trek First Contact and the subject of this review Star Trek Nemesis. While Star Trek: Deep Space Nine is hands-down the best Star Trek television show, Nemesis is almost the best film and the reason is that the producers took steps to go beyond the normal realms of television and family values. Deep Space Nine dealt with necessary evils, war, and realistic relationships, which include loss, and all the relationships had balance (like Kira and Odo...we know what happened!!! Can't be said about Worf and Troi in TNG). First Contact gave us realistic violence and touching issues. In TNG or Voyager, we usually saw our main characters misplaced in the past or future (and DS9 too) but in First Contact we get that \\"human\\" feeling of being lost and being thrust in a future universe. Nemesis, if not for intense cutting, would have been perhaps the most realistic, dark, and fascinating of the Star Trek films. What we are left with is almost on par with VI and First Contact (while none of the films can touch DS9) and is great entertainment despite what Trek fans know is not released.<BR> When I look at the DVD I see that the special features contain deleted scenes but what is truly lacking here (and I can say this though the release isn't for 18 days) is a \\"extended cut\\" of sorts (like the LOTR packages) in which all the deleted scenes are added into the film. This would make Nemesis the strongest Trek film ever. Some of the scenes cut are Data and Picard drinking wine, Crusher dancing, and explanations to why Wesley Crusher is at the wedding.<BR> I will admit that a lot of Nemesis and TNG lore in general is lacking. Troi and Riker have had a lot ofbuild up but there have been so many holes in their relationship that the wedding seems inconclusive and unsatisfying. I also feel that Nemesis should have taken a DS9 approach with its characters by letting some of them go. Worf and Troi I could live without. I think Worf ended perfectly in DS9 by becoming an ambassador...but wait! he's back in Starfleet uniform. Just another large hole in the TNG plotlines. Besides, he has become the Gimli of TNG by providing old jokes and repetitive humor. One of the best things about the last season of TNG was Riker and Worf became very good friends but that diminished quick. What about Riker's ship... `naw', said Berman, `lets not bother showing it. I'm sure we'll make millions!' Millions less my friend! I digress. Nemesis is the victim of its own producing. They managed to produce a solid two-hour film but a fantastic film lie in its extra footage room. Beverly Crusher has always been a consistent companion to Picard and Ms. Gates has great chemistry with Mr. Stewart. There is one beautiful scene that had a lot of potential but is quickly forgotten as further scenes take it over.<BR> The truly fascinating thing about Nemesis is its villain. Next to all the movie villains, V'ger, Khan, Kruge, the God-thing from V, Chang, Soran, Borg Queen, and Ru'afo, Shinzon is perhaps the greatest of them all, and I expect a lynching for this, especially from Khan fans. But truthfully, what makes Nemesis great is that Picard finally meets someone who is his match. Picard always looks confused and taken aback by Shinzon when with every other villain from Q to the Borg, he can remain calm and defeat them with swagger. Hardy's Shinzon is amazingly captivating and though may be physically weaker then half the Enterprise-crew, it is his Picard like thinking and cockiness (from Picard's Academy days) that make him so threatening. Hardy and Stewart are amazing to watch. They shine with speeches of humanity, good, and evil. Though Nemesis is extremely action-oriented, the talking between Shinzon and Picard is the most captivating. Hardy is a great final nemesis for Picard. It is only fitting that Picard's final battle is against himself (essentially). All the characters endings are fitting except maybe Data's and if you haven't seen the movie I won't blow it for you but let's just say that Data's \\"brother\\" B-4 is a script saver just in case another film comes up, though the chances of that are slight. Riker gets one last fight, Worf gets one last fight, Geordi gets a very limited but special moment with his best friend Data, and even Troi gets to do something. That leaves out Crusher but what did the writers give her to do lately anyways. I see Nemesis as a fitting end to TNG that could have been better but still good in its own right though there are many holes and misplaced things due to editing that make the Trek fan and a casual viewer wonder, 'I wonder if Nemesis has more to offer'. The DVD might release some of that extra stuff but just like the Gladiator DVD, the deleted scenes could have made the movie thirty times better (at least from word of mouth for Nemesis) but the films themselves manage to stay on solid ground without the help of their wordy cut-backs.
B00005JLEU|5.0|This is a wonderful film for anyone that likes to watch a good screenplay turned into a great movie. These are the kind of movies that define new pathways, I can't recommend enough that you watch this movie. Read above the rest of the reviews. <BR>I do have some comments regarding this two DVD's set, I disliked the fact that so much importance was given to the people at Disney for their translation and distribution efforts: don't get me wrong here, I think the lipsync work is great and the english version came out very good, but I do feel that Miyazaki and the studio should have had more relevance in this DVD release. I would have liked to see so much more instead of the interviews to the people at Disney! There is a great Japanese program showing the making of the film, but few images of the procces, aside from the storyboard. I would've liked to see thumbnails, the conceptual paintings, more on the digital aspects of the production (the 3d effects are stunning, but nothing was said about them) information on the design of the characters.... I hope that Disney will publish something better on this movie later, it would be a shame otherwise.
B000002MNL|5.0|&quot;Vauxhall and I&quot; is probably the most critically acclaimed album of Morrissey's solo career and is certainly my own favourite. This is the most mellow, gentle of his works. Here the music flows marvelously from start to finish with stunning beauty while Morrissey's lyrics are as wonderfully honest as ever. Personal highlights include the opener &quot;Now My Heart Is Full&quot; (which references Graham Greene's terrific novel &quot;Brighton Rock&quot;,) &quot;Why Don't You Find Out for Yourself&quot; and &quot;Used to be a Sweet Boy.&quot; I find this to be the perfect album to listen to on a pleasant Summer evening.
B000005JA8|5.0|I'm only writing to negate some of the 1 star reviews. I don't want to get into what's cool and who's cool and my Dad can beat up your Dad and I'm in on some joke and you are not, etc.<br />The negative reviews and the positive reviewers all agree on one thing; this stuff is challenging. I have a feeling the positive reviewers may have heard this thing for awhile before ever writing a review, whereas the 1 star posters are displaying the typical knee-jerk reaction.<br />I know I've been listening to this thing for more than 20 years and this is the first time I've bothered to post a review of it.<br />My overall feeling about this record/cd is that it's a supreme work of art. That doesn't mean I hear it alot. There are lots of cds/movies I think are classics which I'm not in the mood to hear/watch very often. They demand too much and may make me depressed, etc. <br />I can't remember the last time I heard this thing all the way through at one setting. This music is so intense that sometimes one song is enough to get you going. <br />The one thing I would like to point out, as other posters have done, is that this music is not improvised and it's not a \\"joke.\\" At the time there were statements that the Captain wrote it all in 8 hours on a piano, and had it transcribed, blah blah. It's alot of hype put out by he himself to add some mystery. <br />In fact, he goes out of his way to make things sound spontaneous, but they are in fact well-rehearsed. Even down to the \\"clicks\\" of the portable tape recorder; making you think he's sitting by a creek and coming up with the next line and then turning the recorder back on again, which in fact he may be, but that's not the point. It's just a particular spin he wanted to put on things when in fact the band spent a long time rehearsing this stuff as can be evidenced on the \\"Grow Fins\\" box set.<br />Of course, does that make it great? Not really, perhaps the band is too tight and makes things more difficult than they have to be. When you know stuff backward and forward that can happen. Also, this is not the best mix job in the World and perhaps it was not even tracked that great. Evidently the Captain and Zappa had different ideas about how to track this thing. <br />But those problems are small in my opinion compared to the sincerity, dedication, humour and sadness contained in this work of art.
0553573403|4.0|Martin himself quotes that \\"the devil is in the details\\", and he was not wrong for \\"A Game of Thrones\\" has devils aplenty. One of the main reasons I picked this book up was because it is dialogue driven. I later came to realise that each chapter, in fact, revolves around one of the many central characters to the book. The plot evolves from the point of view of each character, and the reader gets a nice, solid, all-round overview of what's going on.<br />If only it were that easy. The plot, in fact, becomes almost over-developed, with so many little twists and turns, backing up on itself with the unexpected, that it almost leads to nowhere and leaves the reader insanely frustrated, reminding me distinctly of the Wheel of Time series. Is this yet another marketing ploy, where readers are held in jest, never getting anywhere, and forced to buy more and more books? I hope not.<br />The details in this book are quite phenomenal, and vastly beyond my capacity. There are more \\"sers\\" and \\"houses\\" than I have cousins in real life - and if I can't even remember who all my cousins are, how on earth will I keep track of all the characters in this book? What holds the book together, thankfully, is the focus and development of a number of key characters that are particularly appealing, mostly the members of the Stark family, and let's not forget the parallel story of Dany, who's in another world entirely (for which we, sadly, have no map). Her world is stranger still, but there is a fate yet, for this blood-of-the-dragon girl.<br />The first book focuses mostly on setting a background for following books, along with an entire history for the older characters. There is little magic, a lot of fighting and cruelty and killing, but also some love making which helps alleviate some of the darker tones of the plot. You know that the children of Stark will be important in all this, but after all, they are still just children, and limited by adults and their plots. The personalities are more than just a little appealing, and Martin seems to get the characters exactly right, with flaws and human limitations and all.<br />For those that have a stomach for (physically) heavy books and the patience to read them and their details, I would strongly recommend this book. A Game of Thrones is a pleasure to read and a true fantasy masterpiece, right up there with the best of them.<br />Why only 4 stars - well, I just wish Martin had held off on some of those devilish details and created a somewhat more angelic book to read.<br />.more than just a little appealing, and Martin seems to get the characters exactly right, with flaws and human limitations and all. <br />For those that have a stomach for (physically) heavy books and the patience to read them and their details, I would strongly recommend this book.

B00008DDXC|5.0|Daniel Radcliffe is the only Harry Potter! I love this movie! I think most people, even people who are not H. P. fans, will love this movie. I give it 5 stars! A must-see!
0553579908|4.0|It's not surprising that Martin needed magic coffee to write this book; I wish I'd had some magic coffee to read it -- even more devilishly detailed than the first in the series, this book requires some serious dedication from its readers. In the end, one is rewarded with some focused development of plots.<br />The plot thickens, deepens, twists and turns, and takes on new shapes. Many, many people die in this book, but the reader is also introduced to what must seem like a thousand new names. The pinnacle of this for me was the battle in the bay at King's Landing, when we are suddenly required to remember the names of the ships of two entire fleets in order to make sense of the battle (I skimmed this section, needless to say). The battle was confusing - I suppose battles always are, but the story doesn't have to be. A bit more editing ... perhaps?<br />In similar construct to the first book, Martin dedicates each chapter to a character. Some new ones come about, and some more interesting than others. I personally felt that Dany contributed nothing to this second book, and her role could have been reduced greatly (or her plot should have advanced more quickly). But on the other hand, the book has some extremely interesting developments: Tyrion the Imp, for one. And some of the Stark children, such as Jon, Arya and Bran also find new twists of fate.<br />Largely, the book is overwhelmed by names of \\"sers\\" and \\"houses\\" (as was the last book), and an overdevelopment of the plot. Readers certainly need to be awake to plow their way through this one - no bedtime reading here.<br />What saves the book is that the pace and interest picks up again towards the end, and we can only hope that this will continue in the third book. For avid fantasy readers, and those that like extended sagas and series, this will be a fantastic read.<br />.
B00008977N|5.0|I've been a Peter Gabriel fan for years and have been to several of his shows, but until last week I'd never seen the \\"Secret World\\" concert footage before (although I've listened to my \\"Secret World\\" CD hundreds of times.) After seeing it, I can't stop smiling. What an amazing show - right up there with Talking Heads' \\"Stop Making Sense\\" and U2's \\"Live in Boston\\" as my all-time favorite concert movies. <br />I shouldn't be surprised, given Gabriel's gifts as both a musician AND a visual artist. Certain images will forever remained burned into my brain... trapped in a bright red British phone booth during COME TALK TO ME; his \\"breathing shadow\\" at the end of SAN JACINTO; rowing down the conveyor belt \\"river\\" during SLOW MARIMBAS then happily skipping around the stage while singing SHAKING THE TREE; and ending with a completely exuberant IN YOUR EYES.<br />I'm not going to quibble with video quality (it wasn't apparent to me) or sound synching (very minor... don't worry, this ISN'T Britney Spears lip-synching our National Anthem, for crying out loud!) What I was left with was an immense appreciation for Peter Gabriel's infectious energy and charismatic stage presence. Add to the mix a VERY talented band (Paula Cole is luminous) and one of the most innovative stage shows you'll ever see = an incredibly satisfying way to spend an hour and a half... over and over again! <br />What a feast for the ears and eyes.
B00005RHGL|5.0|Being from Arizona and growing up with the legends of Tombstone, I am immediately skeptical of any Hollywood western that tries to depict the actual story on screen. I was very impressed with Tombstone. The way the movie presented the actual lives of the Earps, who all REALLY had ex-prostitute wives and of Doc Holiday, who really wasn't a very good guy, are worth recognition. Being careful not wash the dirt off the story by Hollywood splendor, the film delivers a very gritty and accurate account of the events leading up to and after the now famous gunfight at the OK Corral. The film also reminds us that the \\"heros\\" in the story weren't powerful, heroic or perfect men, they were just men. It is also worth noting that Val Kilmer gave one of the most incredible performances of his career as Doc Holiday, a shady southern gambler inflicted with tuberculosis. I fully recommend this movie to anyone looking for a great modern western.
0440237688|4.0|How would living in a flawless world of sameness feel like? In Jonas's mind it is a perfect place. No pain. No secrets. No war. It is just as if living a dream. Everyone has a role in the community and is placed in training at the age of twelve. Each year prior to twelve, there are ceremonies. For example, at the age of nine, the child receives their first bicycle. Then at age seven and eight, sweaters are given to teach the child how to put it on and eventually how to button it. Every one of these gifts is meant to teach proper life skills for the future.<BR> Well, it is time for Jonas's twelve ceremony. Everyone is excited to see the jobs chosen for each child. As he stands nervously awaiting the announcement of his name, the announcer mysteriously skips his name and moves on to the next. Come to find out, he is chosen for the most difficult and rarest job in the community, to be the next Giver. So, later he begins his training. Jonas works with the Giver and finds out about what the world was like in the past. The Giver tells him that nobody has feelings or emotions, that the only one who can hold the memories and pain of the entire community is Jonas. <BR> By transmitting the memories to Jonas, he experiences life like no other. At first it is true pleasure feeling the warmth of the sun melting over head. Then the brutal bloody scenes of war approached. Jonas starts to see that sameness is not good. His friends don't understand why he acts out against them when playing a game of war. They're curious about what is happening to him and his odd behavior. When it is just too much for the Giver and him to take, they devise a plan. Will Jonas make it out of the sameness community? Or will they track him down and have him punished?<BR> The Giver is probably a science fiction combination futuristic novel. This book has a very good sense of creativity and suspense. The only weakness is the ending. It does not imply much about what is to happen next. Lois Lowry's writingstyle is phenomenal because of the excellent detailing work and all around eagerness. I would recommend this novel to ages 12+ only because of the vocabulary and understanding of it.
B000002J20|5.0|I consider &quot;Tales From Topographic Oceans&quot; one of the great rock albums, but I can easily understand why some people, including devoted Yes fans, hate it. It's pretentious (particularly the lyrics), inaccessible and unlike anything Yes or any other band has ever done. But I'm surprised that none of the other reviews on this site has mentioned the most unusual and impressive thing about the album: Almost every theme, in all four movements, is built on the same five-note motif: G A G F E.  Sometimes that motif is inverted, sometimes backward (retrograde inversion!!) and sometimes as a background lick in an unrelated melody, but it's the glue that holds the entire composition together. <br />The use of one theme as the basis of a multi-part composition is a common device in classical music, but I know of no other rock album that uses it as extensively or successfully as &quot;Topographic Oceans.&quot; &quot;Successfully&quot; is the key word; no composition technique means anything if the result is a failure. But (in my view, at least) this album succeeds brilliantly, and an understanding of what Anderson and Howe were doing when they wrote it can only help the listener.
B00008S2VG|5.0|I pre-ordered  the limited edition and was very satisfied  with its  box set of contents. A long time member  of Madonna's fan club, I listened to each song and compared  them to her previous  releases... Almost with an anxious ear, I listened  to  each track and heard many of  her famous nuances coupled  with Mirwais' attempts to mindwarp the music.  But, Madonna has once more, effected, translated  and penetrated her audience with a new kind of vulnerability and a new message. A  legend  before  her time  and definitely of her time, I highly recommend this album  to the young, who need to hear  the &quot;real&quot; messages and Hollywood's celebritisms and the  older, who understand the wisdom behind the lyrics and will enjoy the tongue in cheek bantering.  :)-)
B00005JKNC|4.0|This box-office sleeper seemed somewhat interesting, so I sat down to watch.  It turned out to be a rare treat.  The story is told with gentle strokes, giving enough time for the important characters to develop.  Lesser characters are drawn in such a way that communicates volumes within their limited screen time.<BR>There's even a quiet sub-plot that is just a love poem to the movies - the Majestic theater is at once a crown jewel (visually) and a hometown niche that's as comfortable as an old chair, with the townsfolk waiting at once starry-eyed and homesick for opening night.<br />Jim Carrey gives a suprisingly nuanced performance, acheiving depths as an actor that I had not seen from him before.  I agree with another reviewer who said this should have been an oscar-contender performance, had anyone been paying attention.  Judging by his comedic films, you'd expect Carrey to be a one-trick pony, but his performance here brings across the subtleties and variations in his conflicted character with unexpected grace and seeming ease.  Who knew Jim Carrey had this in him? <br />As for the McCarthyism plot, some reviewers here have complained that the courtroom scenes at the end were just over-the-top, or that the film's plot takes an ill-advised turn away from the more interesting part of the movie.  I think these folks are missing the point.  The core of the film is not the McCarthy era specifically -- it could have been any one of a number of controversies or conflicts that drove the plot.  What is important here, and what the film excels in focusing on, are broader questions:  things like honor, duty, integrity, love, community, dignity and self-respect.  These are the themes that make Capra &quot;Capra-esque&quot; -- not &quot;what-if&quot; experiences or earnest young men with unruly forelocks waving the Constitution about.  These are the things that drive Peter Appleton's transformation, these are the themes that Carrey's performance brings out so well, and theseare the values that are at the film's heart.
B00000HZFP|4.0|This cast album of Hedwig is hindered by poor sound work.  The music and score are brilliant, but the sound production is so bad that the singers sound like Marlon Brando with way too much gauze up his cheeks.  These lyrics need a clean, crisp articulation in order to have their maximum impact.  The singers are doing their best, but I would recommend the movie soundtrack if you want to hear what the actors are actually saying.
B00005OAA6|5.0|I like this album a lot. To bad it wasn't released in North America. My favourite song is \\"That Kind of Girl\\". This album really puts you in a good mood. Whenever you just want to relax, and get your mind off everything, put this cd on. I personally find Australian and UK pop much better then American pop. I can't wait for Victoria's new album coming out in a couple of months. I hope she comes out here in North America. Victoria is cool!
B00003CXB4|5.0|Is by far the best animated movie ever created, to date. I loved everything about this movie, and i am anticipating it's release. You don't have to be a kid to watch and love this movie. I am so pleased Disney is bringing this back out, i was so thrilled when i heard the news! Everyone must own this movie.
630522885X|4.0|This visually impressive movie provides a circus like portrait of the famed Lola Montez.  Those seeking a movie bio of the famous Irish lass turned Spanish strumpet and exotic dancer of her day will be somewhat disappointed by the film's treatment here.  While rich with visual appeal and unusual scenes, it tells little about the woman or her life.  The French actress who plays Lola is attractive, but has little of the fire and passion that her subject had.  She is too French and restrained in her acting.<br />Peter Ustinov and the whole circus routine is a unique way of showing what a circus Lola's life actually was with constant travel, lovers and scandal.  Sure we get a few historical references about her life here and there inbetween the circus acts, but the overall story about this woman's life is shallow and weak at best.  People who like artsy, unusual foreign films will no doubt go big time for this one, but those seeking a more substantial movie bio of this most fascinating woman of the 19th Century will surely not find it here.  Even the part of the movie which deals with her famed affair with King Ludwig I of Bavaria is slow and vague on details.  We see little here to indicate that the Bavarian monarch was so taken by her.  Perhaps the best and most authentic part of this movie is the Bavarian regimental band parading by playing &quot;Bayrische Defiller Marsch&quot;.  A nice touch of historical accuracy with correct uniforms of the Bavarian army.  Otherwise we learn little why Lola became such an annthama to the kingdom and why she was instrumental in provoking a revolution there in 1848.<br />Overall a unique and visually stunning movie which leaves the viewer knowing little about its subject.  Lola Montez would be a compelling topic to make a movie on today if they could restain themselves and do a decent job.  Her life was certainly colorful and interesting and deserves a better biographic treatment that what she gets here.  Also the picture quality on this French movie looks more like 1930s as opposed to 1950s.  So much for French technology I guess.  The DVD has done little to enhance the film or provide any extras.this French movie looks more like 1930s as opposed to 1950s.  So much for French technology I guess.

B00003CXXJ|4.0|I don't see what all the hype was over, it's just a average, feel good animated movie, i enjoyed &quot;Toy Story&quot; more, but it is a great DVD to own.
B00005MAM2|5.0|This is the story of a Biker gang.  They run across mutant freaks and one of them (Tetsuo) becomes jelous of Kenada.  The military takes Tetsuo in and unleash his latent physic powers. Tetsuo goes on a rampage and Kenada must stop him.  Truly a great anime movie!
0316779237|4.0|To call David of Sedaris's sense of humor unique, might be an understatement.  In \\"Holiday's on Ice.\\"  David delivers his wicked black humor with a Christmas theme that will doubtfully ever translate into a classic made for TV movie.  These are certainly not heart warming, life affirming tales to read in front of the fire place with a nice glass of eggnog.  To Sedaris, Christmas is an odd assortment of disgruntled department store elves, ..., tv executives, and suburbanites struggling with the \\"true\\" meaning of Christmas.  \\"Give until it bleeds.\\"<BR> As always Sedaris uses his unique viewpoints, and sometimes personal experiences to create rich and creative stories.  \\"Holidays on Ice\\" is a collection of his finest holiday based stories.  While not as involving and complete as \\"Naked,\\" or \\"Me Talk Pretty One Day.\\"  \\"Holidays On Ice\\" is a nice Sedaris for beginners book.  Stories like \\"Santa Land Diaries,\\"<BR>and \\"Dinah, The Christmas Whore\\" are as involved, and as well told as any other story in his longer works.   \\"Holidays on Ice\\" proves once again that David Sedaris is one of the finest Humorists, and all around story tellers in America today.
B00005QHPQ|5.0|the album has a variety of style that can reflect to everyones personal taste. personally i love the way his style of music can go from a sweet balad to a strong pop single. i have been a fan for many years now and i would recommened this album to anyone who has followed enrique's career throughtout the years.  he is a brilliant song writer and interprets the song with such passion.  when it comes time to make the video it helps you identify with what he is try to express.<br />He's great! to me he's one the sexiest and most talented latino in the world.
B000089RVX|1.0|These guys remind me of Hot Tonic and \\"mini-metallers\\"/\\"mini-goths\\". Honestly, some kids must have nothing else better to do than to listen to [ordinary] music on the badio and follow trends set by mtv and other such screwy tv channels. This is definetly not original and no, people who act depressed and dark are not \\"cool\\" if that's what kids are after these days *cough*. Although some people do think it's \\"original\\" and \\"cool\\" so that's why they're so drawn to this new band. \\"In a world where everyone is the same, it's better to be different\\". Come on, seriously, where the hell did that come from? Every human being is equal to one another, if they're normal or not. It's ok to be normal. This cd is not worth the money, I suggest you look around some more.
B00005JKJA|3.0|Not great; not awful.  Glad I didn't pay to see it in the theater.  Frankly, I expected better from Lynch.
0553573403|5.0|I've already seen some of these other lengthy 5-star reviews and there's really nothing more for me to add. The bottom line is that this is--without a doubt--the best opening to a fantasy series that I have ever read. I probably wouldn't push it on my 10-year-old, as the content is clearly aimed at the adult fantasy market, but that doesn't take anything away from the quality of this work (indeed, it only adds to the depth in my opinion). This is a must-read for any avid or casual fantasy reader--hell, anybody that likes to read a great story.
B00005JKPF|5.0|As hard as it may seem X2 was better than the first one, Awsome action scenes right from the beginning.
0553579908|5.0|I have nothing profound to add. Martin is the master of fantasy and this one is no exception. I just wanted to add my own 5-star to help drown out the clueless few who had the nerve to give it only four. I know literary taste is subjective, but I truly cannot imagine how anybody could not love this story (this entire series--thus far--for that matter).
6304437315|1.0|Sorry, but it's not a good one... &amp; I love most Clint movies... sorry to have to give this one a bad review.<BR>To sum up- alot of fighting- but boring!
B00006BTCA|5.0|I first heard about Interpol when they came to play here in Bloomington, IN.  I really only came for the other two bands that opened for them, Turn Pale and The Impossible Shapes (both bands are fantastic!).  When Interpol came on, I wasn't really impressed (pun if you know some of their lyrics).  Maybe I was primed by the other bands.  It sounded at times like Interpol was trying to be their influences: I heard Bowie, lots of Radiohead, not really JD but saw the visual resemblance.  I saw TOTBL in a store for [a few bucks], and bought it.  I thought the studio work was totally removed from the performance, and I really liked it!  Each song stands on it's own, with no filler songs between.  It fit in well with my other musical tastes: Cure, Bright Eyes (letting off the happiness), Velvet Underground.  I can just let this CD repeat!<br />Now, I gotta take issue with ppl who say they're just another JD.  First of all, I don't think Paul Banks sounds anything like Ian Curtis.  Secondly, in terms of originality (there's a whole thread about the Matrix being unoriginal in IMDB.com forums), new artists are heavily influenced by other artists... is that originality?  Bands play songs from other bands and either make it sound better or worse but is that being original still?  If not, then we've been listening to people ripping off Velvet Underground, who was influenced by other earlier musicians and composers (and under the influence of a lot more)... So... everyone is a pale comparison to Beethoven, trying to recapture the originality and the spirit of his compositions.<br />Interpol is a new take on a feeling combined with a type of music which has a feeling all it's own that may or may not have anything to do with the feeling Interpol is infused with.  Like Thom Yorke, Paul sings kinda slurred and you can't really make out what he's saying, but that's alright cuz the clever stuff comes through and most of the time I'm paying too much attention to the electric guitars talking to each other or the catchy bass or the whole composition of it all, and to me the composition is IT.  All the songs are well-paced, they lead me through the duration of the song rather than waiting 8 measures for something new to happen.  Yeah, some of the lyrics are strange, obscure, or just plain don't make sense.  Guess what?  Interpol isn't the first to do that, either!  Unoriginal ...:)lking to each other or the catchy bass or the whole composition of it all, and to me the composition is IT.

630280082X|5.0|A movie that covers all bases, and covers them well. The Mississippi Delta blues legends are explored against a backdrop of fantastic music and a good &quot;road trip&quot; narrative.<br />The guitar duel sequence in the last ten minutes of the film is the finest moment of all movies ever.<br />It is unbelievable that this classic (a thousand times better than &quot;Karate Kid&quot; and certainly far less dated today) hasn't been released as a DVD packed with special features, documentaries about the Blues and Robert Johnson etc etc. Simply a treat, especially if you play guitar yourself. You'll find yourself telling people that they &quot;got no mileage&quot;, or that there are &quot;no goodbyes on the road&quot; for years after you see this.
B00008S2VG|4.0|Why do I love and respect Madonna? For having a point-of-view and having the guts to express it. That is why it is hard for me to see her denouncing the past 20 years.<BR>Why do I feel disappointed? For not showing the original video of AL and playing it safe. Censorship kills creativity especially when self-imposed. <BR>Why do I give this album 4 stars? Because it is a cohesive collection with a couple of good songs (nothing fails, love profusion, easy ride, x-static process, and Hollywood) and some songs with very shallow lyrics and tired subject-matter (mother &amp; father, I'm so stupid, and no body knows me).
B00008S2VG|5.0|I read the review by the guy who said that Madonna should throw in the towel.  Did he like any of her previous albums?  Because I really don't see how you could dislike this album, especially if you have been a fan through the years.  She sounds great.  A lot of the songs make me want to dance, others make me just enjoy listening.  So, ignore that guy.  This is a great CD!  I do not regret buying this CD at ALL!  In fact, I think this might be one of her best albums!
B00008WT5E|5.0|In my opinion, this is the best of the Bon Scott albums.  Actually this is my second favorite ac/dc album after Back in Black.  Not only are there great riffs, killer vocals, and thumping basslines, but this album best reflects what ac/dc is: a pumped-up, amplified blues band.  Best reflected in &quot;Down Payment Blues,&quot; &quot;Kicked in the Teeth,&quot; and &quot;Up To My Neck in You,&quot; this album just oozes dirty blues riffs.  Surprisingly, it also has more radio friendly fare such as the fantastic &quot;What's Next to the Moon,&quot; and &quot;Gone Shooting,&quot; two songs that don't focus so much on the traditional power chords, but rather on the voice of Scott and the subtle backing guitiar of Malcom Young.  Highly recommended for Scott era AC/DC fans.
B00008J4P5|5.0|What a brilliant album. They have such a refreshing sound. The album deserves 5 stars for the intro song along. <BR>All the neigh-sayers go back to the drivel on MTV..

B000002NHN|5.0|Plain and Simple. This amazing woman, as a young girl, actually aspired to be a veteranarian. Hard to believe that she almost took a completely different path in life, if it wasn't for her mother pushing her to create music. <br />One would think that music which combines Celtic, Latin, Eastern, folk, rock, r&b, classical, new age, African, and Mediterranian rhythms would sound awkward and unfocused. Believe me, that couldn't be further from the truth. Loreena blends all of these influences to create her mesmerizing, masterful works of art. 'Dante's Prayer' and 'The Mummer's Dance' have to be the strongest cuts on this cd. They're just amazing! Loreena knows the human mind and spirit so well that she can create music that can sooth the soul of every person that listens to her recordings. Anyone who makes this purchase won't be disappointed for a second.
B00008S2VG|5.0|This album emerged amidst controversy surrounding the war in Iraq.  That historical fact, however, does not diminish the power of this album inh any way.  Lyrically, it's the most accomplished work of Madonna's career.  Musicallly, well it's simply dazzling.  This is music that anyone can relate to whenever they encounter hurdles in their own lives.  The themes of the album are universal, not the &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot; reflections of a has-been.  This album rocks!  Madonna, who never rests on her laurels, exceeds her former accomplishments in &quot;Ray of Light,&quot; both vocally and musically.  This is an album you can listen to repeatedly, whether you seek consolation or feel a compulsion to rant againt the current global climate.  I think this is a fantastic concept album.  Many songs look back to former hits and invoke elements from them.  But Madonna, intrepid as ever, revisits them with a mature, enlightened focus and reaccentuates those aspects relevant to modern American life.  The album is a touchstone for an era, where terrorism and technoligical advances have left otherwise complacent individuals distrubed.  This is an introspective album, highlighting Madonna's refined vocal technique.  Ballads like &quot;Nothing Fails,&quot;&quot;Love Profusion,&quot; and &quot;X-Static Process&quot; are absolutely gorgeous.  In addition, Madonna caters to her devoted fans by supplying no less than FIVE immenent dance-floor smashes.  Forget about the controversy surrounding the release of her video and first release.  This album is a keeper for anyone who has succumbed to the entrancing rhythms and lyrics of our nation's premiere icon.
B00008PX8P|5.0|For those knowledgeable rock and roll fans of Led Zeppelin, this is the one we've been waiting for! This will blow the covers off of their well know DVD release concert footage; \\"The Song Remains The Same\\".  DVD1 chronicles the group at their zenith when they were as hot as a summer stroll through the sierra. For those with bootleg recordings of these excursions know how valuable they are in the annals of Led Zeppelin and rock and roll history. DVD2 offers additional footage of famed Zeppelin journeys that the viewer will sure to enjoy.   Take the week off when this as well as the live double CD,  \\"How The West Was Won\\" is released. I know I am!
0446677450|5.0|The condition of your life today is the result of the actions you have taken and words you have spoken in the past... and THESE are the result of the thoughts you have been thinking in your mind.

This book is the BEST starting place for any person to begin their journey on the road to financial success--no matter what you THINK is limiting you now. Once you learn the way the RICH think, vs. how the poor &amp; middle class do, then you can begin to see the opportunities all around you and your road to finanical success becomes more clear. And as good as Rich Dad, Poor Dad is, the sequel Cashflow Quadrant is even better! However, you need to master the first (reading it several times if necessary) if you are to have any hope of grasping the second. Learn to THINK free, and you will BE FREE. Learn to think like the RICH, and you must eventually BECOME RICH as you will have the same thought processes that they had to become what they are. As the Scripture says &quot;As he thinketh in his heart, so is he&quot;, you must be delivered BETWEEN YOUR EARS if you want the evidence of that deliverence to result in your LIFE!
B00005QIPH|3.0|This album is definetly good but the vines Highly Evolved is <BR>better. The Strokes songs sound basically the same but with the <BR>vines you hear the Beatles,Nirvana, The Sex Pistols and even a little bit of the Beach Boys. After all they were picked by critics as the future of rock. Musically and vocally the Vines are more talented but The Stokes are certainly part of the new rock revolution.
B000002MUW|5.0|This is my favorite Madonna album. Every track is good as she experiments with hip hop when it was just getting big. The best tracks are &quot;Secret&quot;, &quot;Take A Bow&quot;, &quot;Bedtime Story&quot;, &quot;Inside of Me&quot; (which should have been a single), &quot;Survival&quot;.  This album is well worth the money.
B00000K19E|5.0|This movie will shock you. The storyline is about a mam,Anderson, finds out thathis world is not a real world but a computer program. He frees himself and is believed to be the chosen one. His real name is Neo, and he fights off viruses known as the agents. The martial arts are cool, graphics are mindblowing and sweet. MUST BUY FOR SCIFI FANS!!!
B00008S2VG|4.0|Madonna has again given us some great music to listen too.  The album does take an open mind to be enjoyed fully.  This album is not a dance album it is very introspective and hearfelt.  This album is \\"calmer\\" than say the \\"Music\\" album.<br />My favorite track is \\"Nobody Knows Me\\"  which should have been the lead single.  It is pure fun and has killer beats. I hope it it is the second single because it would be a big hit.  Other favorites include \\"Die Another Day\\",  \\"Nothing Fails\\", \\"X-Static Process\\", \\"Love Profusion\\", and \\"Intervention\\".  The weaker tracks include \\"I'm So Stupid\\", and \\"Full Circle\\" and the not so good title track-\\"American Life\\".  But the American Life remixes are much better than the original song.<br />This is not my favorite Madonna album because it lacks the pure fun of earlier albums. If that is what you are seeking stick to Bedtime Stories (amazing album),\\"Music\\", and \\"The Immaculate Collection
B00006JJ1O|4.0|A nice mix of rhythms and harmonies. Songs have beautiful lyrics and the voices are lilting and lovely. I enjoy the bits of Russian mixed into some of the songs, as well as the Russian covers of &quot;All the things she said&quot; and &quot;Not gonna get us.&quot;<br />Some songs does have that techno beat and not everything sounds like 'All the Things...&quot; I recommend listening to clips of all the songs (which don't do them justice), so that a potential buyer can understand the depth and variety of this album.
0553579908|5.0|This series keeps getting better all the time. The characters are realistically created, and their personas develop, sometimes in surprising fashion.<br />As opossed to conventional series, each character can and will surprise you, at the most unexpected moment. For instance,the evil Jaime, turns out not to be so evil after all, the Imp is actually quite honest, once you get to know him, and so on.<br />As you move through the story, you see that the preconceived notions that you have, are shattered time and again. But the characters remain true to their motivations. It is this consistency that is so hard to create and maintain by most writers. If the character is consistent, then he won't surprise you.<br />Mr. Martin however can and will keep his characters consistent, and yet, they surprise you, once and again.<br />It is unbelievable the dexterity with which he does so.
0440236738|5.0|I never write reviews, but for this book I have to. I read this book in about 10 hours. I didn't expect to but I couldn't put it down. Something kept happening and there was a surprise just every few pages. It had enough in it to keep me going and I could not stop until I had closure just like the characters in the book.
B00008PW3Q|3.0|This CD sounds like a follow-up to Tusk. There are some good songs by Nicks and Buckingham, but also some experimental (ie, weird and almost unlistenable) songs by Buckingham. Christine McVie is sorely missed.
B00008S2VG|5.0|This might not be Madonna's best album (I prefer Ray of Light).  After listening to it for the first time I was about to throw it away. But it surely is her most sincere and personal one and after getting used to it (it does not take long) I can't stop listening to it. As expected, Madonna brought something new to music, so some things may dissapoint like the part she rappers (argh!). It's worth though.
B00005JKPF|5.0|I just now finished wathing it and I thought I'd share my thoughts with you.  The movie was Simply Amazing!!!  Director Bryan Singer wasn't kidding when he said that in this movie, they could all let loose and just have a lot more freedom to do things with all of the characters that he couldn't in the first one.  It was non stop action throughout the film and the story progressed nicely without a hitch.  Well...there was one scene that made me say, \\"aww...why'd the go and do that for\\" ( a certain steel-skinned Russian..didn't have a russian accent. )  The film was cranked up a notch toward the end and all of the characters equally got some action.  Also, the ending was a lovely surprise that will leave x-fans yearning for more.  The cast was excellent having kept most of the originaly cast, the sound was decent but one of the main highlights of course was the special effects.  Wow.  Matrix Reloaded will probably be it's only contender this summer.  I liked the first X-men movie but I ablsolutely love X-2 Mutants United.  Luckily I live across the street from a movie theater and I'll be able to see it many many times over.    <br />X-men RULE!!!                         ( X )
0671027387|3.0|Dan Brown gets high marks from some enthusiastic reviewers as a researcher.  But, a little objectivity shows that if you stacked Dan Brown's research against the likes of Stephen Coonts, James H. Cobb, Tom Clancy, or even Dale Brown he would be a C minus student.<br />Open the book to the first page of the Prologue and we find a character quickly tuning his handheld transmitter to 100 KHz.  Sorry, but that just doesn't happen.  But, if you happened to have some sort of super wide frequency radio, the minimum effective antenna at 100 KHz would be about 2500 feet.  Obviously, some researcher had a 3x5 card on LF radio and knew it could penetrate water and ice.  But, the antenna length was an inconvenience, so it was ignored.<br />Okay, that blooper was for convenience, but how about plain old ignorant bloopers?  On page 168 a key character explains that the film \\"Top Gun\\" was ... \\"like a advertisement for the U.S. Air Force.\\"  If you don't know what's wrong with that thought, then this review really isn't for you.  (Hint: Tom Cruise flew an F-14).  There wasn't a single researcher, fact checker, or editor in the production chain who had seen the movie?  Do these folks really care about serious readers?<br />There are dozens of other faults of technical research.  Personally, I also object to making the Delta Force into cold blooded superhuman killers.  Mr. Brown could have invented some \\"Omega Force\\" instead of impugning the real troopers.<br />On the plus side, the idea that NASA is hanging on well past its time is valid.  The Earth science is interesting.  The characters are okay -although showing so many paranoid rascals in positions of ultimate power raises flags.<br />Somehow, when I look at Dan Brown's work in \\"Deception Point\\", it rings hollow.
B000002MTR|1.0|This is the worst chili peppers cd.  With Dave Navarro on guitar, the whole band blows.
B00008DDRX|5.0|Yes, it is true-  The Le Mans DVD arrived today (02May03) and is in my player now.  It looks and sounds fabulous. If you have been waiting as long as I have, for the DVD, get it now!  The classic racing film just got better.
1563898586|5.0|Mr. Moore clearly had fun doing this book. It is chockful of literary references (i.e. Rue Morgue, the Artful Dodger, Fu Manchu, etc.). The characters are multi-faceted not just plain good and evil. Captain Nemo is excellent. I only have praises for this book.
B00008S2VG|5.0|I have two words to say about this album.  ROCK ON!  Madonna does it once again!  Does she ever cease to amaze you?  This album, although not quite her best, mixes the lyric style of \\"Ray of Light\\" and mixes it to the music style of \\"Music\\".  The only negatives I can see... 1.  The CD is way too short.  And 2. Disappointed in the extras.  Other than that, KEEP ON ROCKING, MADONNA!
B00003CX5P|2.0|Star Wars fans waited 16 years for this film, but unfortunately it was not worth the wait. The old Star Wars films were by no means masterpieces of modern cinema, but they were still fairly good and very entertaining. This film, however, is just plain bad. The story is boring and the characters are for the most part weak and one-dimensional (I'll not even begin to discuss Jar Jar Binks). Furthermore, the script is perhaps one of the worst ever written for a major blockbuster. It has been said that the purpose of this film was to set up episodes 2 &amp; 3, but that does not justify making something this poor.

I have not read such a good book for quite sometime it is a beautiful thought provoking story which anyone trying to find there way in the world should read. I liked this book so much I have just purchased another of the authors titles Veronika decides to die which is proving to be another brilliantly thought provoking book!

0151006903|4.0|Baudolino is a very interesting book and follows the tradition of the historical italian novelist Umberto Ecco, who sprinkles the reader with a lot of erudiction and historical facts. When writting this book , he even invented a very particular language, which is used in the very first pages and which is an admixture of Greek, Latin, German and many languages the author is acquainted with in his capacity as a renowed linguist. <br />What makes this book diferent from almost everything else is that everything written comes out of the mind of the very prolific book character Baudolino, who, if we take him solely by his words, had met all the relevant/important historical characters of his time and was present at all the relevant places where History develops. Constantinopla, The Holy Grail, Popes, Emperors and Heroes, weird creatures, are all some of the many ingredients of this fictional story and in the end one has a feeling that what happened did happen only in Baudolino's mind. Or was he telling the truth from the start? Read the book and make up your mind for yourself!! You will not be let down.
B00005JKPF|5.0|Just flipped through the previous reviews, they all gave a high credit to the movie ahead viewing it.  I can ensure you guys, you are damn right.  I have seen the movie this morning, among the first round of preview showings.  It deserves all the hypes and the man is Bryan Singer.  He had once again re-invented the genre into an blockbuster with sophisticated plot in ensemble casts.  It is of course action/FX packed: the opening sequence of nightcrawler alone kicking [butt] along the assasination of the president and it is a lot more epic. It is just breathtaking.  But action asides, there are right enough of the storytellings of each character development, where they ar flowing smoothly in between all the action scenes.  The editing is superb, you will be fed with couple mins of storytellings and then 4 or 5 mins action scenes.  What is the major element distinguishes X2 to other superhero flicks is its not an intelligent-insulting blockbuster, the story is political while playing on the main theme of the conflicts between different groups of human being.  It is certified as 12A in the UK, but I am just wondering that a 12 year old kid may not fully understand the whole story.  It is not just evil and good, its about conflicts between different interests, the historical alliance of the X-men and their nemesis led by Magneto added more interesting layer to the story.  Bryan Singer is the man behind all this, he is the director and executive producer, and involved in the screenplay as well.  He is really good at ensemble movie, without the financial boundary this time, he is capable to pull everything apart and pull them altogether again, and his mastery of mystery and suspense in this movie ar as good as in his classic 'the Usual Suspects'.  Another thing is to put into the right thing in the right time, every mutant with their own speical feature, they are more than fully utilitzed under the setting at the right moment coincided with their own character, sometimes very well assisting the character development, e.g. Pyro's furious fire attack which unveiled his personality and hinted his fall in the dark side at the last part of the film.  It will be a crime not to give credit to the scoring, John Ottaman is back to his collabation with Singer.  His scoring makes the movie a classic, makes it more like a Two Towers than a Spider Man and Singer is the man who makes the difference.very well assisting the character development, e.g. Pyro's furious fire attack which unveiled his personality and hinted his fall in the dark side at the last part of the film.

0060934719|4.0|This is a pleasant story about a lad who lives in a village which is at the border of Faerie.  There, the rules are different: magic works, wondrous creatures exist and miracles do happen.<br />So the lad, on a whim of romance, promises a lass that he will bring back a fallen star which fell into Faerie.  Problem is: the star is a living female creature and there are three or four other powerful entities which desire to capture her for their usage.<br />I could give more details but this would ruin the story.  Perhaps I told too much with the star but that's to give you a taste of Gaiman's creativity.  Overall, a good read and one worth experiencing.
B00005OM4N|5.0|\\"I'm a Slave 4 U\\" This song is so much fun to dance to and its just a great song!<br />\\"Overprotected\\" This song has great lyrics and the remix is even better!<br />\\"Lonely\\" I really like this song and when I had bought the album, I totally could relate to it. It has good lyrics and a good beat.<br />\\"I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman\\" This song was very beautiful and I really love this song. I like to sing with her when I am in my room and listening to this cd. The lyrics are great and you can tell she sings this from her heart.<br />\\"Boys\\" I love this song! It is a fun song to get up and dance to. The remix isnt as great, but the remix is still good. Great song to have fun with and mess around with. <br />\\"Anticipating\\" This is a good song. The lyrics are fun and the beat is fun and her voice sounds fun and its all fun, so yay. It is a good song. <br />\\"I Love Rock 'n' Roll\\" This has got to be one of my favorite songs on this album. It is fun to sing when you are in the privacy of your room. The song is a great remake, and I have to say that she had made the song better. <br />\\"Cinderella\\" This is a good song and I love how the music is. It is like classic and then like modern. Its great and I would love to make a dance for this song. <br />\\"Let Me Be\\" This is a good song, I really like it and I dont know why. The lyrics are pretty simple but I really like this song a lot.<br />\\"Bombastic Love\\" This is a good song, and I like the lyrics, but the title reminds me of Shaggy. The song fits her and everything, but I think the title could have been different. Oh well, I still like the song.<br />\\"That's Where You Take Me\\" This reminds me of certain people. It is a sweet and cute love song. She sings really pretty and soft so I love this song.<br />\\"What It's Like To Be Me\\" This song is very upbeat and cool. I like how it is all fast and energized. I think she should have released this song, but in my theory, I think she didnt because Justin sings in the background, and it would have been weird. I heard that she sings this song at her concerts, though. <br />Overall, this cd is jampacked full of fun! I can listen to this cd over and over again. I bought it when it came out the first day, but it still remains one of my favorite and most listened to cd's. I personally recommend that you purchase it and not download it, it just isnt the same. Have fun with your cd! ~LaNa~
B000007T2Z|5.0|F#A#Infinty is a beautiful, accomplished work by a band who sounds like nobody else. This album seems a tad quieter than what would come later, but it still has the amazing emotional intensity of Lift Your Skinny Fists..., Slow Riot, and Yanqui. The opener &quot;The Dead Flag Blues&quot; is a subdued, gorgeous piece, with an incredibly dark, gut-wrenching intro beautifully executed by the dialog, guitar, and strings. &quot;East Hastings&quot; builds and builds to an incredible crescendo and ends with ambient textures. &quot;Providence&quot; is good, especially when they do the &quot;Dead Metheny&quot; section in concert, but it builds and seems to lead to nothing. The secret track is short, but very sweet. The one problem Godspeed seemed to have at this point was with continuity. The sections of these tracks do not flow seamlessly into each other, something that would be corrected later on. But it's a minor complaint. Overall, F#A#Infinity is an amazing work of music by one of the most underrated bands in the past decade. <br />P.S. See them in concert if you get the chance. I saw them at the Bowery Ballroom this year, and they put on the most incredible concert I've ever seen.
0684833395|5.0|Catch-22 for me, before reading it, held a mythic position amongst books.  This mainly stems from the fact that my mom gave up reading it at about page 50.  From that point on I was determined to read it, to get through it, and to my astonishment, that was not too hard a task.  Catch-22 is an hilarious book, one of the most funny books I have ever read, but it goes far beyond that.  While reading the novel, the most wide range of emotions will be felt by the reader.  You'll laugh at the escapades of Yossarian and his squadron with prostitutes in Rome.  You'll fell heartfelt sadness for the dead man in Yossarian's tent, who never even got the chance to unpack his bags, as well as for the memory of Snowden, just a boy who died too young.  At times you may be surpirised and confused, but that's the plan.  A novel that many consider to be some of the best writing ever done by an American, it does not disappoint.  Set at the tail end of World War II, but going beyond pure criticism of the war, Catch-22 will make you laugh, and then cause you to think seriously at what you're laughing about.  If your asking yourself whether or not to read Catch-22, condsider what the author himself said about it.  When told by a reporter that he had not written anything better than Catch-22, Heller replied simply &quot;Who has?&quot;
B00004TDTO|5.0|Simplicity. That's what makes this Steven Spielberg's best movie. Just four years earlier, he had made his mark with the TV movie, Duel, which consists of automobile driver Dennis Weaver being terrorized by the unseen driver of a diesel truck.<br />For over half of Jaws, the viewer similarly does not see \\"Bruce, the shark.\\"  But he gets to see increasing evidence of the works of Bruce's ... jaws.<br />\\"It's a short season.\\" That's what my old man, a retired contractor, always says of summer in the tourist trap Martha's Vineyard, where he has lived for forty years (and where I used to spend my summers). Jaws was filmed on the Vineyard (specifically, the cheesier, nouveau riche, Edgartown end), which is called \\"Amity\\" in the movie. Peter Benchley and Carl Gottlieb's script, adapting Benchley's novel, perfectly uses the attitude my father expressed: When a series of early season swimmers disappear, the town worthies (led by its mayor, played by Murray Hamilton) fear a business disaster. For business' sake, rather than the public safety, a price is put on the shark's head. Sounds like the Vineyard to me.<br />Roy Scheider, Richard Dreyfuss, and Robert Shaw play the odd trio that seeks to kill the shark: the local police chief, a university shark expert, and a veteran fisherman. What juices the story, is that the shark has something else in mind. (If this sounds familiar, it's only because Jaws has since been ripped off so many times.)<br />John Williams' visceral, Oscar-winning score is the sound of the hunt, the sound of fear. Bill Butler's cinematography is so unobtrusive, as is Verna Fields and Spielberg's editing, that you're unaware of them -- at least for the first few viewings. You lose yourself in the story. (Fields won an Oscar for her work; Spielberg did not credit himself, and thus went unrewarded.)<br />The acting, particularly by Roy Scheider and Richard Dreyfuss, is similarly naturalistic. The most understated performance is by Roy Scheider, who is perfectas Police Chief Martin Brody, an uprooted New Yorker whose facade of restraint belies a nervous nature. But it is the late Robert Shaw who steals the show as Mr. Quint, an Ahab-like fisherman whose obsession with sharks goes back to his experience as a seaman on -- and \\"off\\" --  the USS Indianapolis at the end of The War. Shaw's soliloquy -- which he co-wrote with screenwriter John Milius (Patton) and playwright Howard Sackler (The Great White Hope) -- on the fate of the Indianapolis' crew is spellbinding. (In addition to being one of the most powerful character actors of his day, Robert Shaw was a novelist, screenwriter, and the author of the acclaimed play, The Man in the Glass Booth.)<br />As good as some of Spielberg's recent work -- most notably Saving Private Ryan -- has been, none is as good as Jaws, because he now strives for \\"importance,\\" \\"significance,\\" and \\"symbolism,\\" and for satisfying various constituencies (think Schindler's List), rather than for telling a great yarn. Let us hope that he can someday recapture his early simplicity, and wed it to the technical savvy he's since learned.
B00008MNYS|5.0|As a long-time Robbie fan (Okay then, since Slane) this album shines with Robbie's growth as a songwriter. The many time songwriter of the year winner wins again.<br />Just like the hit song &quot;Millenium&quot; showed the cheeky-rebel can't cheat the oncoming middle age mellowness, but it's a fresh combination that exudes from the earlier tracks in the album. The imp still lives, in the man! Buy it.<br />With Robbies earlier albums already Five star earners, this album should be a six.
006016848X|3.0|By no means this is a good book that provides both men and women new sharp tools to have beautiful and promising relationships.<br />The main drawback is that there are three or four main ideas that are repeated again and again... Probably with half pages it would be equally useful. There is no need for 20 examples that are exactly the same.<br />Regards,
B00004T37H|5.0|During the first few minutes begins a graphic journey of an incredible, and somewhat violent movie.  My children were hooked, and I was a little disturbed.  But as expressed by one of the other reviewers, this movie has a message to all, which I explained to a couple of my children who didn't understand it.  It was about the mistreatment and abuse of nature.  Once I understood the underlying message (when I had the time to sit through a portion of the film) I watched it again and realized what a creative and brilliant movie this was.  Not for all children as it is violent.
038572179X|4.0|I loved this book, I would say it's one of my favorites, I would put it up there with 'To Kill a Mockingbird' - the author has the same ability to really get into every charachter and even writing as a young girl, he really pulls it off! I was totally engrossed in young Briony's world. In our book club, although everyone loved the book, people were split as to which parts they liked best (it's almost 3 stories in one), but we did all agree that at times there is too much detail (hence the 4 stars rather than 5!). Still, it's such a clever premise, the final chapter is especially moving - this is a novel that you could read again and again and see something new every time. Recommended!
B0000028M7|5.0|awesome, awesome album from one of the best bands to come from the early 90's - Alice in Chains. Would? completely blew me away the first time i saw it on tv and this overwhelming feeling of satisfaction always tends to subside me whenever i hear this great, great, great album. Obviously a classic album from an exellent band.. RIP-Layne Staley<br />If you are into Godsmack, see where it all started....
0312305060|2.0|I really don't know what all the hype was surrounding this book, I guess it's a matter of preference, but I found it so excruciatingly dull, I eventually had to give up on it (something that I never do - I love reading!). Maybe it needs a different environment to read (like lying on a beach, rather than on the #5 subway downtown!), so I'll keep it and hope to return to it someday, but for now, it just didn't grab me....
B000002UJQ|1.0|This is ideal bedtime music. Pretty much a snoozefest. No i dont think abstract ...music is cool. No im not a mainstream junkie....I dont like Radiohead. Go figure..
B000001C6M|5.0|young, makeup, and loud music, if you havent see'em like this, buy this album. &quot;Black Magic&quot; is still oen of my favorite guitar riffs of all time. Its sounds very dark. All these songs are very catchy!
B000002UJQ|1.0|No this album isnt 1 star. Yes practically every radiohead fan in the world has rated this album 5 star. No i dont like this style of music. Yes my two favorite bands are Alice In Chains and Tool. Yes Tool is also overrated. Yes they deserve to be. No radiohead does NOT deserve to be. Yes Radiohead are a pretentious band. No Tool are not a pretentious band. Therefore TOOL and ALICE IN CHAINS are better than Radiohead.
B00007BHOE|5.0|Great DVD, has lots of material, lots of energy and stage presence. Stage props, mosh pits, clown antics, 2 dvd's, cheap price, what more do yea want? My only minor complaint was some of the begining and the skits inbetween songs where annoying. There is a bunch of colorful lines, and annoying noises (similar to type-o-negatives dvd). They could have done something way better to kill time.
B00004Y6TQ|5.0|I bought this before I saw the film.  And I liked it.  I really did.  But then I got the movie, and I watched it, and it blew me away.  And now, the soundtrack is even more meaningful to me.  If you like Bjork, and/or you have this album and haven't seen Dancer in the Dark-go see it.  I can't really explain it very well.  I'm just glad we have Bjork.  Ahhhhh.<br />Oh, and the film, it will tear you to pieces.  Sorry.
B000002JR8|5.0|&quot;becoming&quot; alone makes the album worth the buy. I remeber showing this album to my uncle once, who liked older rock (AC\DC, Sabbath, nuggent, etc) He never heard hardcore metal before. When I popped it in and played it, he said &quot;I don't know if I like this!&quot; I said &quot;why?&quot;, he said &quot;I dunno know, it just makes me angry listening to it, it makes me want to go out and beat someone. thats how I used to get back in the days when I listened to Sabbath&quot; I never laughed so hard in all my life! But in some ways it is true: This is some of the meanest sounding stuff on the planet! I can relate to alot of this
B000089RVX|5.0|This cd will satisfy a lot of people. It's got both the fast paced rock (Bring Me To Life) and the slower vocals (My Immortal). This is definitely one of my favorite groups. By this cd!!!
B000002JOH|5.0|One of those few bands that took heads and showed no remorse in there carnage parade! Awsome songs: this love, walk, hostile. If you dont own this, something is wrong with you. Side note darrel once said he had his guitar bridge routed out so he could whammy it at a greater degree, whcihc produces some of his dive bomb sounds.
0553573403|5.0|This is one of the best fantasy book series I have ever read! The story takes place in the imaginery (yet beautifully crafted) kingdom of Westeros, a world filled with battling knights, bloody wars, scheming lords, and strange mystical powers. Fifteen years have passed since King Robert Baratheon rebelled against the Targaryen Dynasty and took the Iron Throne. The story starts out peacefully, but chaos is stirring in the Seven Kingdoms. King Robert's loyal right hand suddenly dies of an unknown cause, and Lord Stark, Robert's childhood intimate and confident, journeys south to investigate the murder. As the plot thickens, so does Stark's perspective increase, and he soon finds out that reason behind the murder... (read the book!) court intrigue, treachery, plans, and strategems all interwoven into one element of conflict: the game of thrones. The book is fantastically written - unpredictable climaxes, breathtaking action, and awesome description! Told from many different characters, the book offers in-depth views of each person and plot. This fantasy series has many sequels, but I feel that I do not need to recommend them because after finishing this first book, you'd be starving for the final one!
B00005U2JL|4.0|the fact that this is spliced together from many concerts takes away from the live aspect of it. Its is still good because it is marilyn, there is many songs, and the qaulity of the sound and picture is awsome, but the concert itself is so/so. There was also times I was questioning just how live the sound was too. There was certain parts of this that sounded prerecorded, then again, maybe its just me....
0345413377|5.0|That this book (and the series as a whole) could be getting less than 5 stars is absolutely RIDICULOUS, especially when the Harry Potter series is doing just that. Comparing Harry Potter to this is like comparing a sketch done by my 8 year old cousin to a Titian, there IS no comparison. To be fair, Rowling's Potter books ARE good, but come on, while Rowling entertains with the adventures of a teenage boy, Pullman has meticulously constructed an allegory that illustrates so splendidly the beauty of love, of life, and of how to live it correctly. Nothing else classified as children's literature comes close; C. S. Lewis and Narnia? Close but Pullman surpasses him. I'll here try to explain why. Everything about the series is absolutely beautiful, and every detail serves a purpose. A previous reviewer claimed that many of the key events seemed subdued, but overlooked the fact that this was SUPPOSED to happen; the protagonists are children and do not have a full understanding of the great magnitude of their actions (hence the battle ending Asrial's crusade could almost be missed by the non-attentive reader). Also, Pullman's choice of children as his protagonists (probably the only reason why this is classified as children's literature; children will probably enjoy the fantastic images presented, but will not understand what Pullman is ultimately aiming at) is key, because of their innocence. Without giving away too much, their playing of Adam and Eve is found in the blossoming of their romance, and in Pullman seems to be saying that this is analogous to the original Fall of man (and that we all undergo this fall in adolescence), and that entering into this love, is our inheritance, and is a beautiful thing; he shows that the Great Fall may not have been such a bad thing after all, because without it we would have been unable to comprehend what true love is, having nothing to compare it to. The chapter \\"There is Now\\" is alone worth the price of admission; In it Pullman fully describes his attack against some tenets of Christianity (catholicism specifically), through Mary's almost objectivist view: that consciousness (and love) alone justifies life, that this life should be celebrated, and lived to the fullest. It is precisely this that makes Pullman criticize the Chruch; it (the church) places more emphasis on the next life, and declares this life to be worth little, while Pullman fiercely believes that this life is immensely important. The ending (which continues this idea with Lyra's charge to form \\"the republic of Heaven\\") is absolutely beautiful and utterly perfect; it evoked very strong emotion in me, something that I find rarely happens in fiction, much less CHILDREN'S fiction. But again, the ending bestows an enormous sense of responsibility onto the reader, and children may find it very unsatisfying. I could go on forever, (raving about how Pullman is able to create scenes of such immense power, how he has tackled an epic-A war on God!-and pulled it off brilliantly, how the dialouge, especially coming from the children, is very believeable, especially in the last couple chapters, the excellent pacing, starting small [as it should] back in the sitting room at Oxford College, and growing inevitably into the war on God Himself, that causes the pages to burn beneath your fingers) but just simply go out and buy the series, starting with \\"The Golden Compass\\" (also, if you can think you can tackle it, read \\"Paradise Lost\\" before hand as well as it was a strong influence on Pullman and the adept reader can find reconstructions of it within). It is completely, utterly brilliant; I very rarely give 5 stars, and this work deserves it.<br />Very Highly Recommendedly describes his attack against some tenets of Christianity (catholicism specifically), through Mary's almost objectivist view: that consciousness (and love) alone justifies life, that this life should be celebrated, and lived to the fullest.

B00008S2VF|4.0|I bought this baby when the doors literally opened the day of her release! WOW! She's really got something to say, and has the 'you know what' to say it!! <br />To be honest, I'm not too crazy about most of the tracks, except for the two hit singles \\"American Life\\" and \\"Die Another Day\\". For such an constantly evolving artist, it just sounds too typical, much like her last album \\"Music\\", the whole acoustic guitar meets electronica sound. Most of the tracks don't seem to stick in my head after hearing them. I was expecting something different for Madonna. However, I do give this album props for making a striking theme about American culture. The pictures and artwork on the album are clever and WORTH the money in my opinion! <br />Bottom line, the music on this album could have been better, but the theme is inventive, confident, edgy, and filled with fun and contraversy.
0060278269|2.0|In Abhorsen, the third book in the masterful trilogy created by Garth Nix, there are many possibilities, but none are fully exploited by the author.  It is hard to feel nervous trepidation when the main villian, Orannis, isn't in the least bit frightning or intimidating, which can't be more different from the main enemy in Sabriel.  In that book, the creature Kerrigor there seems completely evil, with a purpose and a motive.  In abhorsen, the villian appears only at the end, and after we're all tired of hearing how horrible he is.  The formula is tried, and tired.  Even some of the revealed \\"secrets\\" that weren't visable from miles away fail to satisfy the reader.  But undoubtably, the biggest disappointment is the final battle with the Free Magic being Orannis.  Anticlimactic.  There is no excitement, nothing unexpected, or creative in the last several chapters.  It turns out that all the significant characters from the previous two books are somehow linked correctly so that by blessing some insignificant sword they can somehow cut Orannis in half.  <BR>But the book starts out promising, misleading, however.  The king Touchstone and his queen, sabriel, are killed in a stunning assassination attempt, and it seems that the story will be filled with the same, unexpected and sad occuring everywhere.  Misconception.  Half way through, it turns out that they are somehow alive, even though Nix said they were dead, and they help out.  There is nothing more disappointing or annoying than when an author backtracks and covers his tracks with an impossible escape or victory, and it occurs here.  Suprisingly, against all odds, the reader might wish they had stayed dead!  Hard to believe but better than the alternative.  <BR>All the character magic is gone as well.  In the first book, you had a young, adolescent girl strugging to piece her world back together.  Also, you have the mysterious, disgraced touchstone, and thier awkward romance.  In Lirael, you are introduced to a new, fascinating character, and realm.  You meet Lirael, the failure.  The one unable to See.  She often becomes so depressed, that suicide seems the only way out.  Then there's the prince Sameth, who's being forced to become the new Abhorsen against his will.  He also struggles for answers, and ends up starting a journey to locate his misguided friend nick, encountering all the dangers that lie in wait.  But here, in Abhorsen, you are introduced to the same characters, again.  By this time, their troubles and grievences seem boorish and irrelevant - tired almost.  Nothing new here.  <BR>On the whole, Nix has created the same thing as before, except with more disappointments and more temptation to put the book down.  Readers who read Abhorsen first might find it facisating, but others, who have read Sabriel and Lirael will find it tiresome.  An unsatisfactory ending to a great series.
B000001EHS|5.0|Vault is good for someone who only wants the groups biggest hits.The dates are misleading it doesn't cover anything except 1 song before '83's Pyromania album.There are many more good songs off of the first two albums that got no exposure on this album at all.I would recommend Pyromania and Hysteria to even casuall fans,there is enough high quality material on those to albums to please any Def Leppard fans.The songs that made it on this album are good,but I'd buy the individual albums,unless you don't have a lot of money to do so.
B00006CXXU|5.0|I must admit it's kind hard to believe that a singer that performs in a video like Dirty has something good to offer. But Christina does. Her album \\"Stripped\\" is one of the best I've listened to lately. She wrote almost all the songs (except Beautiful)and they're all great. The lyrics are amazing and meaningful, not only heartbroken songs and stuff like that. It's definitely better than her first album, that I also like a lot. But it's different. When you firt linten to it, you think it's a little weird, but listen the sencond, the third, the fourth time. It's amazing! You get rwally hooked to it. The best songs are Walk Away, Fighter, Loving Me 4 Me, Underappreciated, Beautiful, Make Over, Cruz, Soar, Keep Singin My Song. The other songs are also great! It totally worth your money. You won't regret.
B000002L99|5.0|Van Halen lived on in 1986 when they replaced DLR with Sammy Hagar.While 5150 is put down by many fans of early Van Halen.This is some of Van Halen's finest work to tell you the truth.Dreams,Why Can't this be Love,and Summer Nights are the best tracks.The whole CD is very good.I would rank it with Van Halen,Van Halen II,and Van Halen 1984.The Hagar era never reached these heights again though.
B00008OLYN|5.0|...the most hotly anticipated Opeth ablum.<BR>This album is a dramatic change from all the earlier works of Opeth not because they entirely left out death vox and heavy metal sections but because the songs don't have the build ups and changing melodies that truly set them apart. This album has a more Floydish ambience ( probably due the Porcupine Tree influence). The difference is highlighted if you hear songs like To Bid you Farevell (from the Morningrise album) or Face of Melinda(Still Life) along with Death whispered a Lullaby.<BR>Closure is the only song that has that Opeth feeling. I like this album better than Porcupine Tree's In Absentia, which means it is still pretty good, but it isn't Opeth.<BR>Standout tracks are To Rid the Disease (this has that extruciating feel that Opeth are so good at creating), Closure and Windowpane. The remaining songs too are quite good but not so great but that still makes the album one of the best that has been released in 2003. This album probably has the least staying power when compared to the rest of the Opeth albums.<br />I hate what Steve Wilson is doing to Opeth. With him they are making albums with better production but lesser Opethian greatness. With him we will never get to hear another Morningrise.
B000002H97|5.0|Hands down, the greatest album by Metallica. This is the CD that marked the evolution from all-out metal thrash to progressive thrash. The world's greatest band raised the bar for aspiring metal bands across the globe (Pantera, Slayer, Megadeth, Guns 'n Roses, etc.). The Black Album is a milestone on the path Metallica paved through the music universe.
0385504209|5.0|Dan Brown has the keen ability to mix facts along side fiction blurring &quot;reality&quot;. His story is so convincing that one wonders if this all really did happen?? Although, one's suspicion is quickly dismissed by a quick re-reading of the preface where he makes the disclosure that the facts are all true however the tale is fiction.  Theologically his &quot;fictious&quot; story makes sense... he builds his story within the framework of often dismissed theories regarding the &quot;Holy Grail&quot; and the &quot;feminine&quot; aspect of God. His facts are all well-researched and documented. I was fascinated by the story and look forward to reading his other novels as well as taking a second look at DaVinci's works.  This book is definitely a keeper!
B00008S2VG|5.0|Madonna has once again put out a terrific album.  In a few short words to describe the music on this album I would have to say the lyrics illustrate the postmodern condition perfectly.  From songs about what you supposedly need to be happy as in the case of American life, to songs such as Hollywood that display the false nature of the world, and Nobody Knows Me that displays the isolation of the human condition, this cd hits almost all issues of life that everyone can relate to over the head.  Along with Madonna's powerful lyrics the cd contains a catchy beat throughout. I haven't taken it out of my cd player since I bought it. Listen to the entire cd it is well worth your time! Go Madonna!
B00003CX5P|5.0|In this first episode of Star Wars Lucas is once again an innovator. He uses the new possibilities that computerized imaging and creation propose to devise a completely new generation of films. These new tools enable him to freely create hundreds of beings, settings and even situations that could otherwise never be created. He takes great pleasure in the creatures he can create. In a way he is god. So he creates all kinds of monsters, aquatic or land monsters. He also creates intelligent beings with physiques that have little to do with man, and yet they walk and behave in many ways like human beings. Actually he used human models and then created the computerized beings from these models. These new tools also enable Lucas to set up tremendous scenes with strange machines and breath-taking races. This gives to the film a completely new dimension that is pure pleasure for the viewer. At the same time, in this first episode he introduces some characters we have met as older characters in the later episodes, but now in their young age or infancy. We can finally understand why and how the empire appeared and why and how the republic was destroyed. Lack of unity in purpose in the Republic. Democracy hijacked by bureaucracy in the Republic. The desire for a more effective and faster government in the Republic. The desire of the merchants, the industrialists, to impose their commercial rules to everyone and to conquer markets free of any taxation to increase their profits. Finally the ambition of some to seize that power and impose their own will over the whole galaxy. The Jedis are very powerless in front of such a decaying situation in which private interest is taking over collective interest. This film also has a great emotional value with the kid who has to leave his mother, who is freed and has to abandon his mother in slavery, because this Republic goes along with slavery on some planets. A great moment of entertainment.<br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Perpignanignan
B00005JKPF|5.0|Just got back from a midnight showing, and I must say this exceeded all my expectations. The action was phenemonal. The acting was superb for what it is. Everything was flawless. There are two lines of dialogue I would change, and the ending was a massive teaser for the next film. I hope Singer is working on it already.<br />Reccommended even for those who didn't like the first one.
0002171856|5.0|I teach hunter education for the New Mexico Department of Game and Fish and base many parts of my lecture dealing with survival on parts of this book.  I find it to the point, with great illustrations and directions.  I recommend it to anyone with an interest in the outdoors.
0060090367|4.0|At first I was a little turned off by the character's tone (always making little aside comments and digressing excessively) making it difficult to read the book with ease and without getting annoyed. But after awhile, you get used to the style. The story is engaging, funny and a light read. I will definitely try another one of Keyes books!
B00000HZFH|5.0|On the fringes of music you can find some really spectacular things.  It's a journey that's often worth taking- trying to scope out artists doing something unique and passionate in the face of everything corporate and plain.<br />Here's one of those few examples of true gems that can only really be found with a little searching.  Think Sonic Youth but cut the abstraction, and make the music poppier and more accesible, and you've got in in a nutshell.  In all honesty, I'm completely surprised that Built to Spill hasn't recieved something greater than the (albiet big) cult following they've appreciated over the last 10 years or so.<br />This album leads off, uh, perfectly from &quot;Perfect from Now On.&quot;  Where that very incredible album in its own right had sprawling song scapes and drawn out guitar solos that lent it an epic feel, here you get a taste of the epic but also the pop perfection Built to Spill had acheived with its earlier releases.<br />It starts off with probably the most concise statement of their musical direction yet, &quot;The Plan,&quot; which combines sprawling guitar squalor, Doug Martsch's chiming boyish voice, and interesting drum play all into the space of 3 1/2 minutes.  The next, &quot;Center of the Universe,&quot; is probably their most pop statement, with a loping beat and vocal refections on success.  &quot;Carry the Zero&quot; follows with ringing guitar and almost dreampop stylings.  It's the best 6 minutes on the album.  <br />The album swings from one spectrum to another, with stomping rock in &quot;Bad Light,&quot; fun pop meets hair metal in &quot;Sidewalk,&quot; phillosophical ruminations on &quot;Time Trap,&quot; gentle harmonies and longing on probably their most beautiful moment &quot;Else.&quot;  The album concludes somewhat full circle with a stunningly epic track, &quot;Broken Chairs,&quot; the aural equivalent of a relationship breaking.  Few albums can sound so varied and yet seem so consistent at the same time.  It'salso amazing that despite middling in indie territory this band has been able to develop so nicely.  The future doesn't bode well as Martsch has recently released a solo album, but one can always hope that the band will pull an REM ala &quot;Out of Time&quot; and get the success they deserve.  If you love guitar rock and are searching for a band with depth and emotion in a stale time for music, do yourself and this wonderous band a favor and buy this album already.
B00008S2VG|5.0|First of all .. i can't believe how many people judge the album without even listening to it. Many people think that Madonna's latest album is Anti-America or (Controversial). Well, let me tell you, it's not anti-USA or even Contoversial, it's one of her best albums and far better than MUSIC ( which is also an excelent album).<br />Madonna has never opened her heart this way .. her life became an open book .. she wrote these songs from the bottom of her heart .. and also it has less electronica than her previous album.<br />The album contains many styles and themes, it has many GREAT ballads which remind me of her ballads collection &quot;Something To Remember&quot; .<br />I Highly recommend this album and DON'T judge from the first listen .. Give it a second listen and u will be really amazed.<br />Don't listen to those who judged her album after watching the &quot;American Life&quot; Video (which many people wrongfully get it), IT'S NOT anti-USA ..<br />Have A Nice Day ..
B00005JLEU|4.0|If you've never seen the original or a good fansub version of (ahem) &quot;Spirited Away,&quot; you will find it to be a wonderful journey into Miyazakiland. However, if you have a decent fansub, you'll probably be happier sticking with it and passing on the Disney version. The translation is not true to the original - I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and guess they had an inexperienced translator working on it. Better that than the alternative of purposely trying to dumb things down/be PC for the American audience. Words were dropped, nonexistent dialog was added and typos abound. The Japanese version ends with the American-version's cast list. I guess Disney figures Americans don't care about the real actors, even though the voices have more emotion than their English-speaking counterparts. Most of what's written here applies, as well, to Disney's two other recent Ghibli releases. Why couldn't they leave perfection alone?
B00005JKPF|5.0|I just got back from seeing this film and was pleasantly blown away!  This film really concentrates on character building, but there is a great deal of action too!  A few new X-men appear in the forms of Nightcrawler, a Christian who has made an ancient symbol on his body for every sin he has made; Skystrike, Wolverine's \\"twin\\" sister; Iceman, Rogue's new boyfriend who was in the first movie; Pyro, the fire-wielding, leaning towards the dark side youngster and several others who we don't actually meet, but I'm sure we'll learn more about them in the next segment.  <br />It was funny how 2:23 passed so quickly.  I will see it a couple more times in the theatre because you leave feeling VERY SATISFIED.  <br />Way to go X2, you should be a summer smash!!

B00003CXI0|3.0|This movie is good, but not exsactly the best.  I'm not to thrilled with the &quot;witches&quot; and the spells, and so I don't let my young boys watch this movie.  It just leaves too much to have to explain!  But, for older children (like 12 or older, or so), thoes who don't require explinations of pretend things, then its a cute movie.  They did do a good job with animation and graphics.  Sad that the actor who played Dumbledoor (sp?) died!  I hope they get a good replacement!

B00005JKPF|1.0|This movie was a joke.  Talk about silly.  It was way overdone, and if I have to see one more mutant either passing through a wall, or crawling on the floor, I will puke.  I'm sorry, I just found myself in a state of boredom, and felt that the only strong part in the film was Wolverine and his \\"attitude.\\"  Don't wste your time unless you are a real comic fan.
B00005LQ04|3.0|Suspira has alot of happy memories for me from when i was a teenager and first discovering the enjoyment of a horror cinema. I first discovered Dario Argento when i got my mother to hire me the heavily cut VHS version that was only avalible in Australia, (the uncut version has only been avalible here for a short time). When i watch the film for the first time i was caught up with the visual contexts of the film and thought the story of a covern of witches at a school was wicked !!!<br />From there i went on to see all his other films of Dario and thought over time his direction seems to have got weaker. However, you know that your in for an interesting viewing if its directed by Dario.<br />Anyways, to my delight Suspira was released on DVD uncut and full of extras this year and i purchased it straight away. After 10 years i watched this film again and the following is based on this viewing not just happy horror memories from yester year. <br />I still believe that for Italian cinema in the 70's this was one of the best films. It is accessible to international audience due to its mixture of italian and english dialogue and actors. However, i did notice that the english over dubbing was over dramatic and made some tense scenes simply laughable. <br />Furthermore in the scene with the girl and the wire, (its not barbed people, i mean it just looks like what it , large amounts of un-barbed wire in circle formations), how she didnt see the wire before jumping in is beyound me. It nearly a fully lite room and the wire is only about a metre down from her postion. Its like seeing a shark fin in a tank and jumping in. This was my first real \\" oh for the love of god\\" moment of this film and made me question the creditabilty of the film somewhat. <br />Furthermore in the first murder how do we go from the girls room to the rooftop. There is no transion scene from point a to b to c. We just go from the room to the what i guess is just below the roof top as she falls through the centre of the window on the ceiling of the main foyer. It just didn't make sense and hurt any antipation or horror at the scene.<br />I mean when i watch a horror movie i have to be caught up in the atmosphere and the story so that my mind and body begin to tense up but when u are in this state and suddnely you get a muddled scene like this is just changes the mood instantely. <br />Apart from this though the film still held up to my adult eyes and i still really enjoyed the visual style to the movie. The best thing though to come from this movie though is the music. I believed when i was teenager and i still believe today that the chantting of ' witch witch witch' is damn spooky and the way in which the electronic tone increases as the movie goes on is effective, (however get a load of the guys that composed the track on one of the extras, what a joke !!!! the word SAD comes to mind).<br />Overall, the film is a piece of quality italian horror and if u classify yourself as a horror expect you will have already added this too your collect. If your new to it all u may just find it all a bit hokey as the next generation of horror shows how dated this film is. Horror, like everything changes, and what was impactful in the late 70's and early 80's just doesnt cut it with some of the more recent horror films avalible and the new generation who watch them but for a piece of classic horror history, intriguing storyline, (its not as bad as some reviewers have stated), the interesting and spooky sound track and the visual style of Dario, its a worthy purchase. <br />However, i recommend that if your not familar with it to rent first.
B00008R9MA|5.0|This movie was awesome, the action in this movie was incredible, and the Director Micheal Bay did a great job in this one like the rest of his movies but this one takes the cake. I really had alot of  fun, Martin Lawrence is AWESOME he rocks in this movie, his and Will Smith's chemistry were wonderful, THIS MOVIE IS A MUST SEE, I can't wait until part 2 come's out( BAD BOYS 2 OUT JUL,18).
B00008AWOD|4.0|Placebo's latest album is actually a good one..!! I was looking forward to this new CD, but I have to confess that when I was playing it for the first time I had in my mind all the bad reviews it has received from the critics. I was surprised with a very solid collection of songs. The album has some really good stuff on it. Although overall \\"Sleeping With Ghosts\\" is definitely not as good as the band's previous efforts, the CD has some truly remarkable songs, a couple of them could easily be considered as Placebo's best ever. Remarkable songs are the title song of the album, \\"Sleeping With Ghosts\\", plus \\"The Bitter End\\", \\"Plasticine\\", \\"Special Needs\\", and \\"Second Sight\\", all of them very high-quality, classic Placebo songs. \\"English Summer Rain\\" and \\"This Picture\\" are also good. My favourite is \\"Special Needs\\", which I think is one the best songs ever created by this band, it's so emotional, so groovy, so intense, so musically rich.....a very powerful song. Of course, this new Placebo album cannot qualify as a great album, but it qualifies as a good CD. All those bad reviews are an injustice, it has to be recognized that the album has some excellent songs on it. I am happy because it turned out to be much better than I had anticipated. It is worth the money and the time to listen to it. I totally agree with the other reviewer that wrote that Placebo is still a great band by most measures, yes indeed..!!
B00008I8IF|5.0|I'm very fond of Americana and Alt Country music, but I had never heard the Jayhawks.  I got this recommendation on line and certainly am glad that I did.  I'd describe the sound as &quot;Simon and Garfunkle get rootsy.&quot;  Well, OK, maybe the harmonies aren't as tight as Paul &amp; Art, but the have the rough musicality that I love.  I think I'll be buying more Jayhawks.
B000066AXC|4.0|\\"A Beautiful Mind\\" is a well made drama chronicling events in the life of John Nash, a genius with schitzophrenia. I particularly thought that his willingness to fight this disease without medication or shock therapy (after several failed attempts to do so) was really stupid, but it proved to work out just fine! All the actors give fine performances in this film (even those who play the \\"imaginations\\" are good). A good, solid film! Grade: A-
B00006RIO7|5.0|I wish the stars went higher <BR>my mom says she had to watch the title movie 3 times to get it to make sense! itjust screams buy me after you see the movie
B000000OU1|5.0|The Eagles returned with a vengeance with this album! Filled with amazing live renditions of some of their finest songs, including a mexican twist on \\"Hotel California.\\" The four new studio songs are sure to become classics, including the heartfelt ballad \\"Love Will Keep Us Alive.\\" A fine addition to any record collection. Grade: A+
B000089RVX|5.0|Having just recently discovered Evanescence, I can say I'm already totally hooked on their sound. Amy Lee's vocals are hauntingly beautiful and will send chills down your spine. Her range is incredible, and to think she's still so young. I can honestly say there isn't one track on this album that I don't love. My favorite though has to be &quot;My Immortal&quot;. Having first heard it on &quot;Origins&quot;, I was blown away to hear it updated with a string quartet addition which just makes it even more beautiful than it originally was. 10/10 easily.
B00008LDPU|3.0|The Final Flight of Osiris is wonderful. Both the animation and the subject are incredible. The characters are so realistic.<br />The Second Renaissance is the worst of all, I think. Teh subject is really silly. I still cannot believe that Wachowsky Brothers wrote that.<br />Program is okay. Martial art figures and sword fighting scenes are good. <br />A Detective Story is the best of all. Drawings are flabbergasting. Subject is wonderful. You must see it.<br />I've read the synopsis' of the other animatrix films. They seem to be okay, but I cannot decide before watching them. <br />I would buy the DVD just for \\"A Detective Story\\" and \\"The Final Flight of Osiris\\".
B000002AP1|5.0|I can understand the agony of the other reviewers with this CD.<BR>Apparently, this remastered CD version is a far cry from the original issue on vinyl. However, I'm discovering Iggy for the first time, and all I have to say is &quot;Where has this music been all my life?&quot;
B00005JKPF|5.0|Wow! This movie rocks. What else can I say--I liked it even better than the first one which I've seen several times. The first action sequence is spectacular, and there are several more paced well throughout the film. The only time it gets a little slow is toward the end, but that's not enough to detract from the overall experience significantly, at least for me.It's also well-acted, and like the first one has the underlying theme of the need for tolerance of those who are different, and also shows how if you give in to hatred and aggression you will become the very thing you despise (stay away from the dark side).By the way, Highlander fans, there's a regular from that series featured in the film, but I won't give away who it is.
6305546789|5.0|Although Friday the 13th Part 1 was an amazing movie, i think the first Halloween tops it...This was without a doubt the best movie in the Halloween series...There is something about it that is hard to put into words, but it is just a perfect horror movie...The characters are well developed (most horror movies lack), Michael Myers is very scary, and the music is outstanding...Donald Pleasence and Jamie Lee Curtis play their roles perfectly...Most horror films also lack a decent story, which this one excels in...This is all around the greatest horror movie of all time...the only thing that it is missing is gore, which the later films start to use more of...however, everything else about it is so right that it doesnt need the gore...If you haven't seen this film, but it immediately!
B00005JKPF|4.0|I was a bit disappointed with the weak plot and horrible treatment of the characters in the first X-Men movie. As such, I was expecting X-2 to be equally disappointing, if not more so. Boy, am I glad to be wrong!<br />X-2 is what the first movie should have been like (ie closer to the comic). We are forever stuck with the problems of the characters such as Kitty Pryde's character being put in Rogue's body so that in fact we get neither character, Iceman being a student of the school when in fact he is one of the original X-Men, Pyro taking up screen time when he was never part of the X-men (and a stupid character anyway)... I could go on.<br />X-2 also continues the flaw of the first film in that the X-Men are nothing more than few characters with some odd powers they barely control when they should be a fully functioning team with absolute control over their powers. What separates the X-Men from every other mutant is their comraderie and intense training. In the comics, they are powerful, saving the world many times over. In the movies we are constantly seeing them get their butts kicked because they have to stop and concentrate before using any powers. This has improved however. Nightcrawler for instance is one bad mofo who is very close to what he should be. Jean-Grey discovers her powers are increasing (appearantly after the events of the first film) and by the end, she is how she should have been all along. Fans of Wolverine will get to see him actually be Wolverine for once.<br />X-2 succeeds partially because it doesn't attempt to give you some goofed up \\"starting-out\\" story like the first film. It plays like an issue of the comics; you pick an issue up, the action is already flowing, and you have to catch up. From the very opening scene of the movie, you know this is a different film than the first. Every super powered character in the film just seems to be more awe inspiring, capturing the magic of comic book heroes (for the most part).<br />This film sees an even bigger threat to the world than the first film. The previews make it seem to be a threat to the school and about Wolverine's past, when in fact those are really only small parts of it. It's better if you don't know the plot, as I didn't. The finale is ripped out of one of the most dramatic events in X-Men history, and for the fans that recognize it, there is a nice teaser at the very end that makes me think the best is yet to come!<br />If you liked the first X-Men movie, you really should see X-2. It's going to go down in history as one of the few sequels that's actually better than the original (by a good margin I should add). There's more action, more characterization, more FX, and most importantly more story. It's still not as good as it could have been, but considering how lacking the first film was, it's good enough!an even bigger threat to the world than the first film.

B00006F7S4|5.0|Many years ago I saw Beck perform on one of the late night talk shows and--finding the song full of techno gimmicks--I decided Beck's music was not for me.  I recently sat in a coffee shop in Lake Placid, NY, and open-mindedly took in Sea Change--not knowing it was Beck's latest CD.  What a terrificly moving happenstance. If you hear even part of Sea Change, you will run out and buy this CD like I did.  <br />Sea Change is a deeply genuine rock/folk rock master work.  &quot;I Guess I'm Doing Fine&quot; is an aching anthem of life after a loss--already one of my favorite songs (by anyone).  I intend to take a closer look at Beck's other work, but even before I do I am convinced that Beck will sit alongside Bob Dylan and Neil Young as one of the greats.
B00005JLSE|3.0|...<br /> To not make people angry I'll look at the movies good parts first. It has a relievingly dry wit and satire, the script isn't exactly shimmering but it is carried very well by Renee Zellweger, Catherine Zeta Jones (Who, of the nominees, deserved the best supporting actress Oscar), and (to an extent) Richard Gere. It provides a great portrayel of a 1920's Jazzy Chicago that is satirical and realistic (except for the part about people spontaniously breaking in song and dance).<br /> Now the bad. There are the wierd casting decisions such as Queen Latifah (who as far as I'm concerned got nominated because she was in it) and John C. Riley (who got nominated because the Academy thought \\"Jesus, this guy's in everything. Maybe if we give him a nomination he'll stop\\"). The plot can seem repetive, predictable, and all around just plain rediculous at times. But most of all what keeps this from being a favorite of mine is probably the most important element in a musical, THE MUSIC! With the exception of \\"All That Jazz\\" and \\"Cellblock Tango\\" None of the songs are very catchy at all. And the dance sequences were [filmed] in a very uncreative and confusing cinematographic decision, they take place in Zellweger's Mind. Not only that but it flashes back and forth between her imagination and reality, which is not only cheesy but also just [inexpensive] here's this, here's that trick. That kind of thing is easy to do in a movie and is much more impressive on stage.<br /> In short, a half great-half horrible cast isn't going to fuel a mediocre script with tiring musical numbers (well it has, it shouldn't though.)...

I argue with myself, wondering if I should finish it or not. Will something utterly fascinating grab my attention just 20 pages on? Or will the rest of the l o n g book be a total drab?<BR>   Dune certainly has a good plot idea, I'm just not sure that Frank Herbert has the gift of grabbing a reader's attention. <BR>   Please R&amp;R!
B00005JLR2|5.0|Disney has made lots of flaws (not including Pixar movies) since the Lion King. Pocahintas, Hercules, Atlantis and all the dumb sequels and then we got the amazing Lilo and Stich and now Treasure Planet. This movie has the best animation in any animated movie I have ever seen. All the characters are well drawn and it has a good story. Some parts may be to scary for kids but thats why its rated PG. The Supernova part was one of the best climax scenes since the Lion King and Mulan.
B00008PW3Q|3.0|O.K. Short Review.  Some really great songs.  Lindsey Buckinghamd is still a great guitarist.  Christine McVie's voice is greatly missed. Stevie Nicks should be fined if she sings anything. Ever. Heavily fined.  Jailed even. Her voice is beginning to sound like Selma Diamond in the old &quot;Night Court&quot; reruns. Is she sanding her throat with an emery board, does she have a 23 pack/per day cigarette habit, or are those testosterone weight loss shots having side effects?  Inquiring minds want to know. . . .
B00006JJ1O|4.0|Its no secret that this band is a product. It has everything it needs to sell in the West: controversial as always lesbianism, iron courtain feeling and catchy melodies. I cannot imagine a better plan. With this in mind, just enjoy the cheesy music. By the way, this is good pop, with a smart musician behind and really good mixing. I think its the most crude evidence of the music industry of our times, so take it as historical evidence if you want to. I'd rather listen to this cyborg of a duo than to [bands] who really believe in their punk like Sum 41. Its all about who lies less to themselves.<br />TATY is not TATU in russian - its just the \\"y\\" in cyrilic sounds like a \\"u\\" in latin alphabet. Al though they are from Moscow, they are not such a big thing in Russia. You see, Russians are not so easy costumers, and are not thrilled by the controversial, as is the West. And regarding the girls, they could be any two girls walking down Tverskaya St - they are ALL as beautiful, and more.
B00008S2VG|1.0|I have been a Madonna fan since 1984,in fact,it was one of the first albums I bought(I was 10 ;).But this is a disappointment for me,I absolutely loved Ray of Light so this was a let down.<BR>  Lyrics are weak,and probably only makes sense to her alone.The Debbie Harry style of rapping she does in 'American Life' is comical and a dud.Not only that,if that is her take on how American Life is,she needs to stay in England.The love songs dont give me the warm fuzzies either,they are cold and bland.<BR>  Do yourselves a favor,dont waste your money on this one.
0451191153|5.0|This book is about being truthful to one-self. It is wrong to say that this book is not about architecture. First, the architecture of New York and the northern US East-Coast in the 1920s and 1930s is the offspring of capitalism and individualism. Ayn Rand's was born in St. Petersburg Russia and lived through the first years of the Communist Regime, which she detested. She moved to the United States where she developed a theory praising man and what it can do. That is why the characters in this book are so fond of New York - the huge skycrapes are NOT TO MAKE MAN FEEL SMALL, BUT TO ELEVATE HIM THROUGH WHAT HE CAN ACCOMPLISH. <br />On the other hand, you will understand the superficiality of renaissance, baroque, classic and neo-classic architecture used in the early 1920s and 1930s. This architecture is merely decorative. Howard Roark comes to tear all this apart with a concept of unity and \\"objectivism\\" largely criticized but admired by those who do not live with the flow like the passive-agressive Peter Keating who you will probably despise at the end of the novel. It makes me feel like when I finished The Catcher in The Rye.  <br />Other themes include love, sex, jingoism and sensationalism, art, society and socialism. That is why this book is so rich. All this is set with very en-vogue New York as backdrop. I highly recommend this book for prospective and practicing architects and to anyone who appreciates anti-heroes.
B000002MTR|2.0|Com'on let's be real this CD was luke worm--to alright.  The band is just WAY stronger with John back...better songs, compositions, chemistry.  With By the Way there is just more beautiful variation.  Here they are lost and Navarro does not mesh with the band at all.........dave keeps on repeating himself and is in the end just a heavy metal type guitar slinger...
0743201140|5.0|NOW, DISCOVER YOUR STRENGTHS is a fitting sequel to FIRST, BREAK ALL THE RULES also by the Gallup Organization.  Marcus Buckingham was one of the co-authors of the earlier book.<br />This book provides practical information on how to Individualize management based on each person's Strengths which are related to their talents.  Gallup has styled a StrengthsFinder Profiler which can used by organizations and is available for individual evaluation to purchasers of the book.  <br />There are 34 Themes identified which suggest broad talent areas.  The authors assert that \\"...you will be most successful when you craft your role to play to your signature talents most of the time.\\"  It's also true with managers directing their staff.  There are numerous examples of real-life success stories as well as ample information on each of the 34 Themes - both from the individual's standpoint and for the manager.<br />As pointed out in the earlier book also, it's counter-productive to evaluate everyone based on the same criteria and focus on weaknesses.  It's far better to recognize what each position's talents are and hire people with those talents;  with existing staff, move people around as practical to optimize each person's talents.  <br />Another key point repeated in the newer book is not to promote people above where their talent and value is; they are more likely to fail and/or be unhappy.  Find a way to reward and challenge them while they're doing what they excel in.<br />NOW, DISCOVER YOUR STRENGTHS is a valuable resource for everyone.
B00008S2VG|5.0|I have been listening to the Madonna since burning up and i can say without a doubt this is my favorite album by far. Her ability to grow and move beyond who she was before really shows in this effort. I think the songs are catchy and the acoustic guitar work is wonderfull and compliments the techno stuff perfect. Stand out tracks for me are I'm so stupid, and x-static process as well as nothing fails. I can't wait for her to come out with an album of just her and that guitar she is now sporting. I think we can expect great things on the music front from madonna in the future and i think the critics that have dogged this album need to take that nasty fungus covered jewel album out of thier you know whats and give this a another listen. The lyrics may be simple as well as the stucture of the songs,  but simple is not bad, nor does it mean the artist has no real place to come from, or that she has nothing important to say. There is alot of depth and feeling on this album.  This is a great album. buy it now!!!
B000089RVX|5.0|This is one of the moments where there isn't a bad song on the disc.  The producers have done a good arrangement of the tracks on the album - each song compliment the next.<br />Amy Lee's vocals is very powerful.  Her voice stands out, yet blend perfectly with the instruments.  It's not like a typical pop/rock band where everyone tries to compete with each other and all the impression we get is the typical teen angst.  With Evanescence you feel the energy going in one direction.<br />&quot;Going Under&quot;, is a very clever first track to introduce the band.  They slowly introduce everyone starting with Lee's voice and guitar, followed by drums, keyboard, etc. until everyone starts to jam together - all within 25 seconds.  Check it out and see how the instruments slowly piece together within that time.<br />&quot;Bring Me To Life&quot; will always be the most powerful song.  It's the reason why I bought the disc, but definitely the only song worth listening to.  You think it's a slow song because of the piano intro and slow vocals until the drum kicks in and background vocals shout &quot;wake me up!&quot;.<br />&quot;Everybody's Fool&quot; follows the rocking mood.<br />Then &quot;My Immortal&quot; slows things with a haunting violin in the background.  &quot;Haunted&quot; will bring the pace back up, with &quot;Tourniquet&quot; kicking things in full gear.  Of note in this track are the drums and guitar.  As the song ends &quot;Imaginary&quot; takes over, with no pause between tracks.<br />If you think you're in for a slow ride, &quot;Taking Over Me&quot; will continue the rocking pace.  It's &quot;Hello&quot; that gives us a moment to pause.  Piano, vocals and violin - that's it.<br />&quot;My Last Breath&quot; brings the whole band back.  It's like the last song until they give out one more encore song &quot;Whisper&quot;.  Definitely not a quiet track.  A good ending that leaves you wanting more.<br />My suggestion, leave the disc in the player and set to &quot;repeat all&quot;.  Make sure you have good speakers or audiophile headphones to appreciate the hi fidelity of the instruments and vocals. Enjoy.;repeat all&quot;.  Make sure you have good speakers or audiophile headphones to appreciate the hi fidelity of the instruments and vocals. Enjoy.
B000089RVX|5.0|My favorite band right now is Evanesence. Although they don't call themselves a Christian band, their album, \\"Fallen,\\" is infused with Christian themes in much the same way as LOTR.<br />Musically, I would classify them as \\"alternative metal\\" like the band Linkin Park because of Ben Moody's hard-hitting guitar riffs and the occasional use of rap. However, the angelic female singing along with the sometimes classical, Celtic, and choir accompaniment sounds like Sarah McLachlan. Alternatively, they could be called \\"Gothic rock\\" because of the strong dark undercurrent that runs throughout as well as the intense and tragic subject matter.<br />And yet there is light that shines in the darkness. In \\"Bring Me to Life,\\" after describing total depravity as being \\"numb without a soul, my spirit sleeping somewhere cold,\\" lead singer Amy Lee begs and pleads for someone, presumably God, to \\"wake me up inside, call my name and save me from the dark, bid my blood to run before I come undone, wake me from the nothing I've become\\" with almost evangelical intensity. Similarly, irresistable grace is depicted in \\"Taking Over Me,\\" with the lyrics, \\"I believe in you, I'll give up everything just to find you, I have to be with you to live to breathe, you're taking over me.\\" There is an extensive use of creative and poetic language, such as in \\"My Last Breath,\\" with the words, \\"Holding my last breath, safe inside myself, are all my thoughts of you, sweet raptured light, it ends here tonight, I'll miss the winter, a world of fragile things, look for me in the white forest, hiding in a hollow tree (come find me), I know you hear me, I can taste it in your tears.\\" But perhaps the most dramatic and my personal favorite song is \\"Tourniquet,\\" about someone who used to have a relationship with Christ but fell away and committed suicide, and now cries out to God for forgiveness as she lays bleeding and dying from a self-inflicted wound. This song will bring tears to your eyes and may cause some insomnia, but sad songs are good for the heart.<br />This is a ground-breaking, on-the-edge album, showing that it is possible to be fully Christian and fully rock, and reflecting the truth that the Christian life is not about folk rock, happy songs, and Little House on the Prarie but really about intensity, tragedy, and pain while at the same time not relinquishing truth, beauty, and hope. Just so you know, I'm not generally into Christian rock, and when I bought this album I didn't know that the lead singer and the lead guitarist met in youth camp. Anyway, U2 and Jars of Clay may have paved the way, but Evanesence is the next step.
B000089A06|5.0|This one beat the last release hands-down.  Good job done by all.   Of course, without Hopkins, they would all be zeros.  The man must personally understand Fear at a level most of us don't ever get near or he could not pull such a wonderful acting job off in this series.
B00008H2LB|5.0|The new songs have addictive beats and easily remain in your head for weeks. They've mastered the art of blended rock, pop and rap and they're nothing short of amazing.
B00005QZWI|5.0|I have never heard any soundtrack so beautiful and indulging. The music of The Lord of the Rings, composed, conducted, and orchestrated by Howard Shore is amazing. You can listen to it, and you know what the music is for and where it is in the movie, and you get the picture in your mind of what is happening. With music, you know where you are. Music is the base for a movie. It provides feelings. It emphasizes evil, good, fighting. If it's the Shire, you can hear the kids playing, the carefree attitude, the butterflies flying around. In \\"The Black Rider\\", you can see the Black Rider, right in front of you. There is that evil theme, along with black speech that just adds another level of evil to the whole thing. You know it's evil, but the music just makes that much more. In \\"Many Meetings\\", you know that its in Rivendell. You get the first peaceful scene for many tracks. It comes back to the Shire theme, which in itself is beautiful.The elvish just adds to the fact that they have reached this safe land, going back to the Shire theme over and over, because everyone's together with everybody else. Then comes \\"The Council of Elrond\\" and Aniron, the theme for Aragorn and Arwen. You here the wonderful elvish love song. This track finally introduces another theme, that will also be used interchangeably in latter tracks. This is followed by more Shire, and then the wonderful royal tune that I just can't put a name on. The switching back and forth of these marvelous tunes makes tracks 9 and 10 a pleasure. Track 11 and \\"The Ring goes south\\" starts off with a nice slow string melody, and then the strings get faster and faster, introduces the drums, which are a wonderful way to get the beat. The Shire theme plays in a way that you've never heard I before, only by the brass, which gives it a totally different feeling. Then, the climax finally hits, and that royal tune plays again, loud, and in a royal tone, by the trumpets, that were made for this tune. As the trumpet wanes out,the low brass give a little ending melody, into drums which closes out the track. Skipping Track 12 to 13 and \\"The Bridge of Khazad Dum. It starts with a fast royal tune, and into a fast drum beat, which signals the Fellowship running away from the orcs.Finally, we enter a song of the Black Speech, which gives you that evil feeling again. We enter \\"Lothlorien\\", and we get 2 or 3 new themes at the same time. First, the Lothlorian theme, slow, rich, and dark. The elves start singing a \\"Lament for Gandalf\\" in a eeirie way that gives that eerie feeling to Lothlorien, even though it is a safe land. The elves keep singing into the next track, \\"The Great River\\", in a nice peaceful way. The royal theme plays again, into another theme that I cannot name. Then,a theme that I'll just call the up-down theme, playing a scale up, and then down. This is repeated over and over, ending the track. \\"Amon Hen\\", and the Lothlorian theme plays again, speeding up with strings to a climax of trumpets which mark the upcoming of orcs,a mix of the royal theme and many others. The trumpets play a wonderful melody, which ends in cymbals. This trumpet theme is variated again and again, louder and louder, until finally the orc theme from Moria comes, with the low brass providing the evil, dark melody, and the drums giving the constant \\"Boom\\" \\"Boom\\". Finally, we come to Track 17, my favorite, \\"The Breaking of the Fellowship.\\" Starting a peaceful string melody, it turns into a changed Shire theme. This song takes all the nice themes and puts them in one, introducing a few new ones along the way, like the strings with a round, and a little mourning for the fallen Boromir. The Shire theme can be quirked with in so many different ways, and each one sounds so beautiful, like a whole new piece itself. Finally, the pan pipe provides the Shire theme, and it is used interchangeably with other peaceful, soft melodies, with instruments trading off from trumpets to brass, to strings, to clarinets, and of course the percussion just gives it that extra little bit. And once you think the 7-minute track can't get any better, at about 5:30, a song comes, called \\"In Dreams\\" It is very good, interpreted through both the Shire theme and royal theme. Yes, it is in English, and if you want to sing along, words are included with the CD. The words do make sense, talking about how Frodo and Sam are the only ones heading to Mordor, and how they will never be separated, because they are good friends. The final track is  a song sung by Enya, which I really don't give any thought to, because it has nothing to do with the movie, but it is a nice song to listen to, with a nice slow, peaceful tune that includes a beautiful elvish line in every 2nd verse. I hope you enjoyed this review of the soundtrack of  \\"The Lord of the Rings. The Fellowship of the Rings.\\"

B00004Y87O|5.0|If you're an old Clint Eastwood, Spaghetti Western fan, John Carpenter's `Escape from New York' will seem vaguely familiar.  Only the faces and places have changed!  The action is robust, and the dialog is sparse.  The year is 1997, and New York is now a maximum-security prison.    Air Force One is hijacked and crashes into a Manhattan high-rise; and the President (Donald Pleasence) survives by ejecting in an escape pod.  It's Kurt Russell's job to get him out; and he has only twelve hours in which to do it!<br />Isaac Hayes is this film's gun-toting big-man-on-campus.  Lee Van Cleef (looking as trim as he did years ago with Clint) appears as Kurt Russell's handler.  Adrienne Barbeau ......   (And I had almost forgotten, after all of these years, just how heavenly they were!)<br />The movie builds to a climactic drive-across-a-booby-trapped-bridge-and-shoot-me-with-a-machine-gun finish.  Isaac ends up looking cooler.  And Adrienne takes it like a bowling pin and is run over by a car (which, for some reason, I found to be hilariously funny).  But her gorgeous chest somehow manages to remain intact.  (Thank god!).<br />If you enjoyed, as I did, John Carpenter's more recent work, `Ghosts of Mars', you're sure to love this unabashedly formulaic blast-from-the-past antecedent. I thought it was great!
B0000064TT|5.0|I picked up this album circa 1980, after seeing the band on TV's \\"Midnight Special.\\"  I'd been listening a lot to Jean-Luc Ponty albums like \\"Cosmic Messenger\\" and \\"Egocentric Molecules\\", on which the songs had fantastic, intricate opening and closing sections, but in the middle were long solos while the band vamped on two chords.  The Dixie Dregs, who like Ponty were inspired by the Mahavishnu Orchestra, took Ponty's approach to the next level.  While a Dreg soloed, the rest of the band was always doing something interesting to keep the listener's attention.  The result was the best answer America has ever been able to produce to Britain's prog-rock bands like Yes or ELP:  five virtuoso musicians, playing instrumental-only rock music with great melodies, intricate arrangements, and catchy solos, in a variety of styles that somehow all worked together.  Led by Steve Morse, who for my money is the best guitarist on the planet.<br />\\"What If\\" has better production and more consistent songwriting than the first Dixie Dregs album, \\"Freefall\\".  The cuts, mostly written by Morse, include straight-ahead rock (\\"Take It Off the Top\\"), progressive rock (\\"Odyssey\\"), ballads (\\"What If\\" and \\"Night Meets Light\\"), bluegrass (\\"Gina Lola Breakdown\\"), and even a baroque piece for classical guitar and violin (\\"Little Kids\\"--a passer-by once asked me if it was Vivaldi).  The best cuts are \\"Take It Off the Top\\",  the funky \\"Ice Cakes\\", and \\"Night Meets Light\\", but even the weakest track would be a highlight on many a lesser band's album.  \\"Night Meets Light\\" is a stunner, a long, gorgeous tune with a lot of time-signature changes that aren't immediately apparent (there's a lot of 5/8).  The Dregs' signature sound is electric guitar and violin playing in unison to create a wailing sound.  Allen Sloan's violin work is especially stunning, able to both match Morse's breakneck speed and give a impossibly lush, romantic sound to solos on \\"Odyssey\\" and \\"Night Meets Light\\".<br />(1=poor  2=mediocre  3=pretty good  4=very good  5=phenomenal)
B000063JDE|5.0|Blue Velvet is like one young man's giant fantasy come true.  Think Summer of '42 - but ten times weirder and more sexual - and you'll get the picture.<br />Kyle Maclachlan (Jeff) comes home from college and discovers a severed ear being eaten by ants in a field.  He becomes embroiled in a mystery that he attempts to solve - and does.  Along the way, he gets involved with two gorgeous women; one a cute-as-roses high school girl played sweetly by a young Laura Dern, the other a sultry nightclub siren who likes her sex rough and who is portrayed deliciously by the unforgettable (and nicely breasted) Isabella Rosellini.  Using his boyish charm, he coaxes both to fall in love with him - and he manages to bed one of them.  (Guess.)  Both of their boyfriends get [angry]; one of whom beats him up - badly!  Yet he recovers quite fully.  <br />Compared to David Lynch's more recent work, Mullholland Drive, Blue Velvet is fairly linear in its storyline.  Both, in their fashion, push the envelope of acceptable male fantasies.  In the `80's it was sado-masochism.  Today, it's lesbianism.<br />The story reaches a climactic conclusion.  We get to see Miss Rossellini completely naked..., and we get to watch Jeff, our hero, blow Dennis Hopper's brains messily across the living room floor.  Despite enduring a nude Isabella pawing him uncontrollably, Laura still loves him - and marries him.  So everyone gets to live happily-ever-after.<br />Blue Velvet - which uses the song poignantly - is unforgettable.  Don't miss it!

0790729628|5.0|What if, as a person, you came into this world fully-grown, fully aware, experiencing life to its fullest -- but were to die in just a few years?  In that time there could be no family, no grandchildren, and no debilitating diseases to signal the pending of one's demise.  The curtain would close - at the height of one's existence.<br />What if, as a woman, you were also thrusted into the world fully developed -- mature physically, but an emotional novice - and that you allowed yourself to be molded to the satisfaction of your man's desires?<br />It takes a while to get there, but that is what the movie `Blade Runner' - based upon the novel \\"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep\\" by that classic sci-fi writer, Phillip K. Dick - is all about.<br />The film, made in 1982, pictures life in Los Angeles in 2018.  (Even though we're halfway there, we're not even close to achieving the technological advancements depicted.)  Harrison Ford, much younger, is the hero.  He is a \\"blade runner,\\" someone who kills the replicants (fake humans relegated to other worlds) when they trespass on Earth.  The special effects, although dated and looking like something out of `Battlestar Galactica', are still excellent.  The look of the movie is dark and brooding, like  `Alien', another of Ridley Scott's works.  <br />Three replicants come to Earth and Harrison goes to meet them.  He kills a few, and falls in love with another.  There's some erotically gruesome slow motion death scenes of beautiful, scantily-clad women (Daryl Hannah one of them) being shot in the back and in the gut, oozing innards a la Sam Peckinpah-style, which is ok since they're replicants.  Rutger Hauer, who looks like Paul Newman, gives the most touching performance as he struggles to come to grips with the end.<br />The movie is futuristic - but actually much deeper -- which is probably why it's achieved an almost cult-like status.  This is a great feature if one wishes to ponder - the meaning of life itself.  Don't miss it!
B000002VTE|5.0|I personally find it rather confusing as to the extremely varied reception this album recieves, both from clear non-fans and long time supporters of the band. Whilst it is true that if you want straightforward rock, or fear free jazz noise, or fear orchestration, this record will not be up your street, otherwise this is a monumental work on all levels.<BR>The melodies have been broadly criticised here, but to be honest they are more a vehicle for the excellent witty, emotional lyrics, and anyway the meat of the melodicismcomes embedded in the richness of the arrangements themselves.<BR>As to it being over-produced, that is really a question of taste. I think if one was to take that term to mean overly sugar coated, (over-engineered vocals, an airless perfectionism that destroys emotional connection) then that would be totally inacurate. Perhaps the arrangements are incredibly intricate, and perhaps a lot of people brought up more on the pop/rock side of things find that a little hard to get into, but as far as i am concerned, and having lived with this album for about 4 yrs now, it is amongst only three or so records i have ever heard which bear listening over and over and over again, and part of the region to that is in the overall depth of sound achieved.<br />The album is perfectly structured, from crystaline overture to emotional breakdown, to spiritual reconcilliation, but it is the final song which is the sucker punch.<BR>Coming after Cool Waves, offering us the traditional happy ending, (perhaps the forgiveness after a relationship breakdown), Jason gives us the real ending, the twisted, heroin dark, bitterly swampy, emotionally numbed Cop Shoot Cop.<br />It is quite a referential album, to the minimalism of Glass and Nyman, the cyclical music of Reich, the swamp blues of Dr John, 60s psychedelia, 70s sludge rock, 80s drone rock, classic soul and funk, Pachalebel's pastoral grace and classicism, even the fire music of Albert Ayler in the noise jazz sections.But this is not unmediated or messy artistic theft, rather the creation of a confluence of ideas, all filtered through the prism of band leader and lyricist Jason Pierce. <br />I would say however that this is one of those albums that gradually grows on you, rather than announcing itself from the off. For the first few months I thought it was a weak album with three or so really excellent tracks. Then I forgot about it, then I remembered it, dug it out, and after maybe a year or so showed itself as the masterpiece I believe it to be. Which would you rather have: the albums which are great for a couple of weeks, then tossed away, or the ones that live with you all your life?
B00005JLH3|5.0|Drumline is a heart-thumping, feet-stompin', get-up-and-shake-your-...-and-feel-good type of movie that makes one thankful to be alive. Nick Cannon plays a gifted drummer from the inner city who gets a full scholarship to Atlanta T&T, a predominantly black college which has a long history of having an exceptional marching band.<br />Most of the characters are black. A few well placed faces are white. The story, of gifted ambition fighting against the system, is universal. Nick's love interest is Zoe Saldana, a lovely cheerleader (whom I had seen in Center Stage and Crossroads). Orlando Jones (Evolution, The Time Machine) plays an overly conservative band director who is challenged to bring more excitement to defeat longtime rival, Morris Brown College, at the upcoming band competition classic.<br />Nick wears his motor-board and graduates from high school. There's a touching scene where he goes to see his father, who works as a ticket taker - and \\"thanks\\" him for not being there when he needed him. In college, Nick's rebellious nature gets him into trouble and eventually kicked off of the band. He makes a triumphant return - and everyone lives happily ever after (but, of course).<br />Along the way, however, we are treated to the most exciting display of marching band prowess - and drum line percussion riffs - I've ever enjoyed anywhere! Take it from me, you'll never in a million years view such an exhibition on Saturday afternoon NCAA football!<br />The finale is spectacular. On the field, you'd be life-challenged to see black cheerleader mid-driffs more sensual; or black drum beats so inspirational. The bands duel, and tie; and the drum lines face-off for the conclusion. Not a word was spoken, but I've never experienced anything so dramatic; and I literally ended the film with my heart pounding in my chest, and tears streaming down my cheeks.<br />There's a touching moment in the deleted scenes where Nick goes to thank his father - who turned out to offer him a key piece of inspiration in the film. <br />Drumline is viscerally and emotionally powerful; and it is easily one of the best movies I've seen all year (black or otherwise). I'm sure you'll love it as much as I did!
B000002UBB|5.0|I think one of the best tests of an album's quality is if the songs still sound fresh and interesting years after its release.  Well, 27 years have elapsed since Steve Miller recorded Fly Like an Eagle and after all this time it's still a very enjoyable album to hear.  I like every track on this album with the exception of Sweet Maree, which seems kind of aimless and doesn't really fit well with the rest of the tracks.  I also must take issue with the reviewer who referred to Miller's cover version of Sam Cooke's You Send Me as &quot;by the numbers&quot;.  The tight harmony vocals on this track are superb and make it stand out as one of the best tracks on the album.  My favorite tracks are You Send Me, The Window, Serenade, Dance Dance Dance, and Mercury Blues.  In my personal opinion, this CD is one that any rock afficianado ought to own.  It's a classic from a year that brought us a wealth of great music.
B00005JLO2|2.0|The Four Feathers applies twenty-first century pacifity to 19th century chivalry - and the result is not pretty. Cowards become heroes. And those who serve their country admirably are made out to be fools. If you're looking for a movie that will get your adrenaline rushing, this feature is more like a swift kick in the groin. Any excitement is neutered by needless sentimentality. The pomp and circumstance of the British Empire is wasted. Even the glorious battle scenes attempt to demonstrate, not bravery, but stupidity.<br />The means by which the coward achieves his redemption are fairy-tale like in their absurdity. And whereas he appears manly and rugged as a desert drifter, he looks positively preppy and effeminate in his layered sweaters back in England. Kate Hudson, the object of two men's affection, is useless window dressing. Her character's fate attempts to show that remaining faithful to a wimp is always the better choice.<br />The second part of the movie, honestly, is much better than the first. The coward ends up in a prison which is more grotesque than your worst nightmare. Think The Midnight Express in the Sudan and you'll be close.<br />The ending is absurd, and every scene in the movie is too long by half. I haven't endured a war movie this ludicrous since The Thin Red Line with Sean Penn. Be sure to pass this one by!
B00005QAPH|5.0|Otto e mezzo has now entered my top ten movies of all time!
0790737345|3.0|This is dreary. WHile watching the film it seems better than average of its type; moving, original, gorgeous to watch. That, at least, is what I thought before watching the Wim Wender's film 'Wings of Desire'on which 'COA' is ostensibly based. I changed my mind fast. I would dissagree with the amazon.com reviewer above: Hollywood's constant leaching, and abysmal defiling, of European cinema's finest ideas is disgraceful, especially when one considers the amount of money cinema punters wasted on this aneamic 'remake'compared to what meagre earnings (comparitively) it's superior forbearer earned. <br />For those interested, 'Wings of Desire' is, as of my writing of this pseudo-review, due to be released on DVD at amazon.com soon. Check it Out. <br />To sum up: the measure of your enjoyment of these vastly different cinema modes can be gleaned as follows: Do you enjoy Sarah MCLaughlan's soulful, crooningly sappy themesong for 'City of Angels', or prefer songs by Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, a few of which grace \\"Wings of Desire\\"'s soundtrack?<br />Non-'aggrevation induced by sub-titles' is also a must, unfortunately.
B00000DQWT|5.0|I had never heard of Pat Metheny. I was feeling David Bowie's &quot;China Girls&quot; and when the track &quot;This Is Not America&quot; came out, I went and brought this album hoping to hear some even fatter tracks from David Bowie. I'll never forget walking down S. King Dr on the south side of Chicago, and putting in my walkman the soundtrack. When &quot;Psalms 121&quot; came on I was in a trance! To this day, I have no idea how far I walked on that hot summer day of 1988 but I kept turning that tape over and over again, thus was my introduction to Pat Metheny. I am a huge fan of his and was fortunate enough to see him in Chicago during the &quot;We Live Here&quot; tour. There he actually performed for the first time &quot;This Is Not America&quot; and it was an unforgetful, AWESOME show.

B00008H2LB|5.0|When i heard Linkin park was finally coming out with a new album after all this time, i was excited and nervous at the same time.  Hybrid Theory was so amazing as a debut album that it seemed impossible for them to be able to produce an album that would satisfy the high expectations that all their fans had for them.  Meteora has proved itself to truely be worthy of listening to.  It still has some of the feel of the Hybrid Theory, but they have progressed to a higher level of music. You can tell this in songs like, Breaking the Habit and Faint.  This album is extremely addicting; you play it once and it won't leave your stereo.  I would have to say that Linkin park has really outdone themselves this time, and i can only expect more wonderful music from them in the years to come.
B00005YXZH|2.0|So one day, I find myself on the other side of the country in manhattan at the virgin record store and I realize that YHF was released yesterday. So I go looking around for it and I see it on the wall. A most anticipated<br />As I get closer to the listening station, i realize there's this 13 year old, upper east side, pale, dyed-blonde anorexic in a cardigan sweater slumming on the Wilco album. I had come face to face for the first time with another Wilco listener. It was quite a sight given that I am a freaking 35 year old 6 foot tall overweight south asian living in berkeley. What do I have in common with this waif? Anyways, after I listened to the album, then I realized that this album really would appeal to a 13 year old. Diffuse, meaningless lyrics, borrowed gimmicks (if you are 13...you would never know this)...enough to satisfy any teenager's angst quotient. <br />There are some very cool things about the album and some very complex music but come on...give it a rest with the gratuitous Pink Floyd rip. As much as I like Wilco, please...people...pop in Summerteeth or disc two from Being There...the best music around.
B00005JKPF|4.0|Better special effects, more action and an excellent opening sequence. Better then the first.
B000003TAW|4.0|Weezer's first CD is a great one at that. It starts out strong with the beutiful guitar solos of &quot;My Name is Jonas&quot; and carries itself strong until the climax at &quot;Surf Wax America&quot;, where then it slows down again and ends with the long, but still good &quot;Only in Dreams&quot;. Those people who bought this CD because they heard &quot;Buddy Holly&quot; will be pleased, as the CD follows that format. In short, amazing.
B00006CXSS|5.0|This is the HBO mini series following the 101st airborne during WW2.  I have seen them all, Longest Day, Saving Private Ryan, etc. etc. This is the best period.  It is like taking Saving Private Ryan, the Longest Day, A Bridge Too Far and a couple other classics then combine them in one new movie that is like 10 plus hours long not including the special features.  It will make you cheer, cry and see new things about this war.  It will never bore you if you like good war movies.
0394806220|5.0|This is a really cute book.  If you read this to your kid a lot, they start to recognize the words, the colors, and sounds.
B00005JKPF|5.0|The wait is over and super heroine Storm (Halle Berry) and her mutant friends have blown back into theaters.  This time, we are treated to more action, new characters and a visually pleasing film that doesn't disappoint.  While some characters have been scaled back in the story line (such as Cyclops and Rogue), this movie gives us more of Storm and her ability to control weather, young X men in training, Iceman and Pyro, and the Xavier-like Jean Gray.  Villains held over from the previous film are Mystique, whose role also expanded in this film and Magneto, played by the always talented Ian McCellan. Bryan Singer did a good job of juggling the meagerie of mutant characters under the care of Dr. Xavier.  I also like how he exhibits the theme of being an outsider in the movie, such as the one scene in which Bobby (Iceman) returns home.  The scene has Iceman \\"coming out\\" to his parents and revealing the dreadful news that he is a mutant.  It plays like a young man revealing his homosexuality to his parents and shows the broader scope of the theme of exclusion felt by the mutants to the rest of human society.  The most interesting new addition is Nightcrawler, played perfectly by the charming actor, Alan Cumming.  The scenes with Nightcrawler transporting are extremely well done and I hope we learn more about the blue skinned mutant in the next film.  The story line with Wolverine continues with some resolution but leaves plenty of information in the dark for the inevitable sequel.  There is a death in the film that I felt was unnecessary--I won't say who--but it would have been interesting to see this character return.  However, with the number of heroes and villains in the world of the X Men, there are plenty of new characters to choose from for the next movie. If you haven't seen the first film, you might want to check it out before seeing this one, although it isn't completely necessary.  There is enough interesting things going on in this movie to keep your attention and make you a fan of this group of heroes.  The ending also hints at things to come in the next film (for one hero in particular), making me eager to see the next one and dreading the wait for it to appear in theaters!  Make a trip to your local theater for this popcorn flick...you will not be disappointed!on and make you a fan of this group of heroes.

B000002MFN|4.0|OK. This is not \\"Like A Prayer\\", \\"Ray of Light\\" or \\"American Life\\". However, \\"Erotica\\" was unfairly scorned by critics. There are many exciting and very *erotic* songs on this album. Erotica, Fever, Deeper and Deeper, Bad Girl, Waiting, Thief of Heart, Rain, Words and Why's It So Hard are, in my opinion, some of the greatest Madonna songs ever.<br />The music ranges from disco beat to underground (i.e. Waiting) to general pop. It's a nice album to own. It'll grow on you and drag you into a trance of eroticism.<br />I highly recommend it, especially to those Madonna fans out there that don't already have it.
0192833588|4.0|Sense and Sensibility is a pretty slow book. I felt as if I had to wait and wait for something interesting to happen. When something did happen, I found it to be pretty predictable. I think that some parts of this old book have been used in other films. I know I am not all the sudden good at predicting what happens in stories. I think it was just this book. I was confused in the beginning of this book because I spent most of the time trying to get all the Dashwood people straight. After I became familiar with the characters, I started working on the plot. I have to say that the plot was a bit uninteresting at times. When it was interesting, and not predictable for me, I really enjoyed it a lot. There were several surprises in the book. I enjoyed how tricky the plot was. Toward the end of the story I began wondering how the plot was going to wrap itself up. The ending of the book was quite unexpected for me.<br />One of the things that I liked best about this book was that it was so tricky. Once I thought the movie was going to end a certain way, but I was immediately proven wrong. I think this happened at least five times. The bulk of the story may have been a little dry, but with all of the twists in the plot of Sense and Sensibility, I have to say I was entertained. One of the lower parts of this book would have to be the ending. It seemed as if in the space of about three minutes everyone went from melancholy, to perfectly content with their lives.<br />Overall, I have to say that I enjoyed this book. Most Austen fans do not praise this as her best book. Most of them overlook disliking the book because it was Austen's first book. I cant be to sure because I have never read any other Austen books. However, after reading Sense and Sensibility, I am definitely going to dig in to another Austen book really soon.
0156027321|4.0|I think the book is more about the adventure, rather than the life, of Pi. I picked the book because of none other than the Booker Prize.<br />Yes, the first 100 pages make the interesting introduction to the fascinating main character, Pi. I feel sorry for him to so badly want to love God he somehow got it messed up.  The inter-faith dialog incident is simply hillarious!<br />Then the misadventure... what an amazing one. Pi ended up in a lifeboat in the middle of the Pacific ocean.. with a number of zoo animals.  His perseverance and endurance for survival against not only the sea but also the fierce, dangerous animals are candidly written and and elaborated in details. His knowledge gathered as a son of a zoo owner proves handy, and helped him beat the odds many times.. really fascinating.  And this is from someone who doesn't like animals!  There's sufficient elements of surprise and a nice touch of curiosity for me to keep turning the pages.<br />A book with very good story-telling to carry us along with the amazing tale.  Towards the end I even hoped.. &quot;please, don't tell me the alternative story is the truth&quot;.. but no, I'm not spoiling this to future readers :-)
B000002NJS|5.0|Having just listened to her latest offering &quot;American Life,&quot; I have come to realise how great &quot;Ray of Light&quot; really was.  Plenty of positive things have been said about this album, so I guess there's nothing more one can add.  It's so sad though, to see her fall from such rich creativity and maturity to the pitiful, tired, half-hearted effort that is &quot;American Life.&quot;
B00005JKPF|5.0|This is the best sequel EVER made! This makes X-Men 1 look like Pee Wee's Playhouse. This is everything every comic book movie wasn't. This movie is PERFECT! Let me start off with the Nighcrawler scene at the beginning of the movie. That alone was the most incredible action scene EVER in a movie! The Matrix? What's the Matrix? Just about all of the characters in this movie have a balanced time on screen and they all get to show off their powers. The only one who was left out was Cyclops. But he does have more to do this time than last time. Storm gets a lot more to say and plays an important role in the outcome of the story. She still doesn't get to fly but what she does do makes up for it. Wolverine is COOL! Magneto kicks BUTT! But who is the coolest mutant in X2? MYSTIQUE!!! She went from a nobody in the first film to the most incredibly cool character in this one! When you go to see this movie be on the look out for Gambit's name on a computer screen (Remy LeBeau) and Beast on a TV screen (Hank McCoy.) This movie sets up X3's story line which should include a major role from Jean Grey. She is one of the most powerful and important characters in this movie and in the next she will probably be the most dangerous. Go see the movie. If you don't like it there's really no hope for you.
B000050XEI|3.0|Enya's music has been a part of my life for almost 15 years now and I've loved every album she has released - until now. Now I don't hate this album at all, it's still Enya and it's still pretty but it's so formulaic. The sound she explored on her previous album is capitalized here to repetitive effect. The same drums, the same plucky keyboard strings, the same overlayered vocals that are signature to her sound (and sound gorgeous on her previous releases) aren't as fresh here. Even the chant 'tempus vernum' is little more than a 'pax deorum' part 2. Each previous album had it's own unique sonic soundscape and this new one just doesn't stand out to me as much I suppose. <br />I guess I prefer her darker, more stark soundscapes she explored on Shepherd Moons and The Lord Of The Rings. <br />Now, all that said, I still listen to this CD believe it or not. ^ . ^  As I said at the beginning, it's still Enya, and it's still pretty... it's still haunting as always... and if you are a die hard Enya fan, you really must have this.<br />Tracks like \\"deora ar mo chroi\\" alone make this CD worth while, it's one of her most gorgeous music moments in her entire career. <br />ALSO, I reccomend her latest CD set that comiles many tracks from all of her works. It's much more complete than Paint The Sky With Stars and it contains the best off of this and her others.
B000089RVX|5.0|This CD is absolutely brilliant!  I wouldn't call it heavy metal, though (which I equate with Metallica, Pantera, etc.)  It is rather a perfect fusion of darkwave lyrics and melodies, metal guitar with strings, piano, and oh, yes, the voice of an angel &quot;fallen&quot; from Heaven.  My favorite part is the seamless segue from the end of &quot;Tourniquet&quot; into &quot;Imaginary&quot;, it sends chills up my spine.  This is my new favorite band and I also can't wait to see what they do next.  However, despite their spiritually meaningful lyrics, they are not Christian rock (check out the article at MTV.com &quot;Evanescence's Label Tells Christian Outlets to Yank 'Fallen'&quot;) which makes it easier for my pagan sensibilities to enjoy.<br />My only question is, when are they coming to Denver??
B0000797IO|4.0|This movie is so much more than I had expected.  It's a mix of 'American Beauty' and 'any romantic comedy'.  The situations that Justine gets herself into are hilarious, and the colorful charecters that populate her world are amazing.  This movie is truly a wonderful surprise.  The DVD has a few extra features but nothing really to get excited about.  I think this is definately better than alot of comedies out there.
B00008PW3Q|1.0|Un-listenable hogwash comes to mind.  While I do believe myself fully capable of self hypnotic enthrallment when it comes to my favorite artists, this one stretches the bounds of delusion to the breaking point.  While it'll sure just sell and the catatonically faithful will sing it's praises, anyone who stays connected to planet earth during their listening experience has to come away wondering what the hell the point of making this was.  The Mac's done some great stuff in the past, but this is, in my humble opinion, unmitigated [bad music].
B00005JKPF|4.0|I'm really not into comic book stuff, and I never did see X-men I. The trailers for X men 2, as well as my friends, induced me into watching it. Although I'm still not into comic book characters, this movie was quiet exceptional. The best part of this movie are the camera techniques that have been used. The underscoring of the movie wasn't so good at first, but it turned out to be ok towards the end. The lighting, parallel editing, and various shots such as high angle, medium, and long were some of the various techniques that helped to emphasize the fights really well. There was this once scene, where a shot of Wolverine's face dissolved into a wolf's, and then back again. I don't remember the exact word for that. There were times during the movie where I got bored, because some of the dialogue just seems monotonous. Some of the fights scenes, besides the angles being great, were sort of bizarre because the people were just twisting and turning in slow motion. If the music, along with the quick body movements are used to accentuate a fight scene, what's the point of showing the bodies flying around slowly? <BR>I also didn't like how the trailers shows Deathstrike's power. It wouldn've been much better and more drastic if people just saw it for the first time in the movie. And what was up with tha guy without the shirt? Apparently he plays a big role in the comic book, but he's just shown two or three times in the entire movie. <BR>I would definately recommend this movie to those who are really into fiction, but for those who are not, it'd be better to just wait for the video/dvd.
B00005QXDD|1.0|As a fan of the show on HBO, i don't think this album serves the D justice.  It just seems like an opportunity to cash in on Jack Black's success and sudden stardom.  The songs on the TV show, \\"Lee\\", \\"Explosivo\\", \\"Tribute\\" and others were funny and catchy, but only in their lo-fi, mp3 off of Kazaa-type format.  The dual acoustic King Diamond-esque guitar worked on the show.  It doesn't work when they pump it up with guest stars from such legendary heavy metal bands as Phish and, GASP (the caustic lords) Foo Fighters.  If you were a fan of the show on HBO or downloaded early Tenacious D songs you will not like this album.  Unfortunately, it's hard to find the good stuff anymore...
B00005QZ7U|5.0|There seems to be two schools of thought regarding Baz Luhrmann's 2000 cinematic musical extravaganza Moulin Rouge - boring rubbish or shining star in commercial movie making. Considering I have awarded five stars, it's safe to assume that I do not belong to the former!<br />From the creative opening titles (red curtains opening up to reveal the Fox logo, with a rather manic orchestra conductor included), you know you're in for something different to the Hollywood norm. The entire film continuously bombards its audience with an amazing array of visual imagery - constantly moving bold colours, stunning costumes, fast paced editing, energetic dancing and recognisable modern music.<br />The plot is fairly predictable - poor boy falls in love with popular girl, they fall in love and against all odds they come together only to have one die. The entire plot is given away within the first few minutes so it's safe to say that the plot of Moulin Rouge is secondary to the visuals.<br />Ewan and Nicole do an excellent job characterising through song - A brave move for two well known and popular actors to expose their other talents to the world - a move that has paid off handsomely. Whatever people think of the movie, their performances are difficult to fault.<br />The standout actor for me is the Australia Richard Roxburgh. Despite some roles in Hollywood movies like MI2, he remains unheard of outside Australia. As the Duke, Richard shows us another side to his acting - cartoonish comedy combined with evil drama. Richard is an amazing character actor and hopefully Hollywood will see more of him in the future.<br />The 2 disc DVD set is packed to the brim with extras, giving fans the opportunity to explore Moulin Rouge to its' deepest depths.<br />Disc one has the movie itself as well as 2 engaging and entertaining audio commentaries. There is a special version of the movie entitled 'Behind the velvet curtain' where several times during the movie a green windmill pops up and pressing enter on your DVD will bring up a featurette pertaining to that section of the movie, such as the in-depth discussion of the creation of the stunning opening sequence.<br />Disc 2 has many featurettes and interviews to explore. From the music to the costumes, a huge amount of information is divulged for the fans who wish to explore the movie making process. My complaint here it is that many of the actors and behind the scenes crew give glowing accolades to the Director Baz Luhrmann. He may very well be a genius, but we don't really need to be reminded of it every 5 seconds. Aside from that minor gripe though, there are many hours of entertainment in the special features.<br />Whatever your opinion of Moulin Rouge, it has been a pioneer in recent Hollywood movie making, leading to the current revival of the Hollywood musical. If you can get past the thin plot and immerse yourself in the colourful, fast paced world of the Moulin Rouge, you will discover a very special movie.<br />.
B000002LQR|5.0|This is by far the best Chili Pepper album.  The Chili Peppers achieved perfection by combining funk, rock, and rap elements in the perfect blend and proportion.  The album is its best on tracks like &quot;Funky Monks&quot; and &quot;Apache Rose Peacock&quot; where the band is able to truly delve into the regions of funk.  Timeless and still great to this very day, &quot;Blood, Suger,... is one album that can withstand repeated listons without becoming tiresome.  It is a favorite in my collection.
B00006879E|5.0|Marron 5's catchy, up-beat rock songs with a funky beat are what make them so loveable.  Sunday Morning is possibly the most catchy song on the face of this earth, and This Love and She Will Be Loved follow closely behind.  &quot;Songs About Jane&quot; is a must-have for anyone who appreciated good rock music.
6305546789|4.0|This movie was pretty scary with all of the music in the background and when Michael was chasing the girls around.  I did think that there was going to be a little more action or gore, though.  But I did enjoy the movie!
B000001EYW|5.0|STILL WATERS the CD was a gift I received shortly after the death of Maurice Gibb. It is one of their last recordings, released in `97, a few years before THIS IS WHERE I CAME IN. The Bee Gees have gone the way of Led Zeppelin now, and smart people will make this recording a classic. Here are a few of my observations about the CD. I hope they'll be helpful to you.<br />ALONE/STILL WATERS: I think people tend read how other people describe a song and agree with it. I don't. I think ALONE is very Celtic-sounding. I hear bagpipes when I hear this song. It's also very folksy, even as it is a toe-tapper.<br />I SURRENDER/WITH MY EYES CLOSED/STILL WATERS: As a black teenager in the 70's I remember hearing Jive Talking on the Midnight Special (before the disco era ruined it) and realizing The Bee Gees had some definite black roots! Point of fact, they were doing rap before it became mainstream; they certainly pre-date Hall and Oates among the white groups experimenting with the sound. STILL WATERS RUN DEEP is also a lilting toe-tapper that shows me an early Motown influence with the use of the tambourine (How Sweet It Is), plus my ears hear the old Four Tops song of nearly the same name in the rhythm. These two honor their black influences, yet their originality comes through with crystal clarity.<br />These are hands-down my favorite tracks. The bass is kickin' and it brings me back to the days when I had a serious jones for Barry Gibb...and I wasn't the only one at my school who did, either!<br />IRRESISTIBLE FORCE/SMOKE AND MIRRORS: Poor Robin always sounds like someone who's in incredible pain, you almost want to shoot him to put him out of his mystery. ...Couple that with the fact that Robin's looks have improved 100-fold as he's gotten older, and you've got the true enigmatic figure in the group.<br />OBSESSIONS/MIRACLES HAPPEN: I read a reviewer that said the song \\"Obsessions\\" frightened them. Are they insane? Well, I'm not going to rate another review if that's how they really feel, but let the record show that I couldn't disagree more. This song, which could be covered by any number of boytoy groups out nowadays, to me has all the frightening elements of the Piglet movie. Now, Miracles Happen has more ominous undertones than the other. But again, most Bee Gees material is fairly tame. As for me, I love the vocal layering, even the synthesizer works, and I always dig Barry's vocal punctuations throughout.<br />CLOSER THAN CLOSE: I couldn't review this CD without a passing nod to Maurice, who does the lead for this song. I don't recall ever getting to hear his singing voice in a Bee Gees recording before, and I have to say unlike his twin, he has a very pleasant voice. I'm sorry he didn't get more opportunities to do more than a super-high falsetto harmony on most songs.<br />This recording is definitely a new favorite of mine, and I highly recommend it to those who hadn't listened to the Bee Gees for a while. Current Bee Gees fans bought it, regardless. I personally think it's wonderful to listen to a recording with the knowledge that the singers are playing real instruments and are ... good at it, too.they really feel, but let the record show that I couldn't disagree more.

B000069HKH|5.0|alright if you like bruce youre gonna like this album.  but seriously, the people commenting on the sincerity of the cd..who are you to judge.  i think the whole 'he wasnt living close to the wtc as me, he cant understand whats going on' or 'hes rich he cant be sincere' thought process [stinks].  everyone felt it, everybody suffered.  dont let your self rightousness get in the way of enjoying this cd.  FYA
B000000H64|5.0|On Fear Factory's Soul of a New Machine, they took more a death metal edge, but on their release of Demanfacture Fear Factory took more of an industrial metal direction for it. I know a lot people don't call this metal because theres no guitar solos, but honestly I think its criminally wrong to call them anything else. \\"Demanufacture\\" the opening track wastes no time getting to business as your introduced by Raymond's bass drums. Burton chants along \\"I've got no more ... regrets, I've got no more ... respect\\". It really gets chanting along towards the end when its just Burton. \\"Self Bias Resistor\\" is just flat out brutal plain and simple. \\"Replica\\" has that Metallica feel to it without copying or ripping them off. \\"Dog Day Sunrise\\" is a really good cover song which showcases Burton's full talents in his voice. \\"Pisschrist\\" might have the most memorable opening to a song ever. You might recognize it as basically one of the themes for Arnold Schwarznegger in Terminator 2. Well it doesn't last long before just being a brutal track with Burton showing melody. I strongly recommend this if your a beginner in the metal world, and also check out Obsolete and Digimortal. I'd get Soul of a New Machine and Concrete last to just adjust to their previous sound.
B00000K19E|5.0|Even though The Matrix was released in 1999, it can easily be considered the first motion picture of the twenty-first century, a movie unlike any that had come before.  This was the DVD that, upon its release, many of us bought in order to see just how good our new DVD players could be.  The special effects, with an exception or two, were unprecedented in terms of their scope, style, and presentation at the time, and the somewhat complex plot managed to capture the imagination of untold numbers of movie goers.  Combining science fiction, action, and adventure in an entirely new way, The Matrix was nothing if not exceedingly cool.  For once, I will not dwell on the plot; it is hard to explain, and those who know nothing about it can easily find summaries of it.  I will say, however, that I'm a little surprised that so many people embraced this movie with open arms because the plot is somewhat ambiguous, and the ending seemed to invite the possibility of a sequel without coming right out and announcing that it would happen.  I find similarities between this movie and Vanilla Sky in this regard, yet many who were totally confused by the latter film seem to embrace this one.  Laurence Fishburne was the real star of this movie, in my opinion, bringing life to Morpheus in such a way that made the convoluted plot seem plausible; a lesser actor in that role could have doomed The Matrix, no matter how incredible the special effects were.  Carrie-Anne Moss also blessed the character of Trinity with a humanity that enriches the film.  Keanu Reeves overcomes a couple of what I like to call David Schwimmer moments early on and grows into the type of hero this movie demands.<br />As for the special effects, I found them exceedingly good but perhaps a tad overrated.  The early \\"mouth\\" effect, for example, was shockingly unimpressive, and the slow motion wave-like movement of bullets toward the end looks a little hokey to me; everything else was impressive indeed, though, particularly the famous jumps and helicopter sequence.  One of the really nice extras available on the DVD is the feature on the making of The Matrix.  While it takes a tiny little something away from the movie to see how those acrobatic jumps and fight scenes were filmed, one cannot but be deeply impressed by the level of commitment of the actors in terms of their months-long preparation and training.  The movie commentary offers more insight into the movie, and the music-only audio track is also a nice touch.  When I first dove in to the DVD owner pool, The Matrix instantly became the movie by which all of my DVDs were judged.  As time marches on, this has changed a little bit, but age should only enhance the fascination of movie lovers with this very impressive, unique, and extraordinarily cool film that heralded a brand new century in movie-making.rly the famous jumps and helicopter sequence.

B00005JKPF|4.0|My expectations for summer blockbuster sequels have been virtually destroyed by recent summers which gave us watered down mush like \\"MIB II\\" and the feeble Star Wars sequels. Besides, the original X-Men was just a good, if not fully realized, superhero movie. I probably would have been happy if the sequel merely lived up to the original.<br />Within the first 20 minutes \\"X2\\" establishes itself as that rarest of beasts: the sequel that surpasses its predecessor on virtually every point of comparison. If anything it's even truer to the comic, as a cigar-chomping Wolverine comes into his own with the kind of brief responses and one-liners his animated counterpart has spat out for years.<br />The newcomers are engaging, especially Nightcrawler, who opens the film with an action sequence that is made truly breathtaking with rocket-fast camera work, imaginative editing and cutting-edge special effects. Everything I've read so far makes reference to this sequence and with good reason. There is nothing like an action movie that grabs you by the throat from frame one.<br />We learn more about the returning characters from the first film and we get to see them interact in new ways, some not by choice but by necessity. We understand more about what makes them who they are in a way that is universal to anyone who's ever felt excluded or outside looking in. This is due mainly to absolutely top-notch acting from almost everyone. It's like nobody has told Brian Cox, Patrick Stewart or Ian McKellan that they're in a comic book movie and their line readings run the gamut from earnest to grave to brutally funny. I was starting to think Magneto was going to be sidelined for the film but when his moment in the sun arrives, McKellan is so good I actually was cheering for him.<br />On that point, I'll just say that my audience was cheering, laughing, and applauding throughout the film. Seattle audiences are desperately snooty and we're quick to show our displeasure for cheese or lazy filmmaking (a la Star Wars 1999-present) and all I can tell you is this film is a true crowd pleaser. Go stand in line! Every moment is worth it!
B00000251N|5.0|It's difficult to review a CD like this because it is either music that you enjoy or not. Neal Diamond gives a stunning soundtrack to a beautifully filmed movie. This soundtrack will not let you down if you are a Neal Diamond fan. The movie itself is fairly difficult to come by but if you have seen it and enjoy the music, the quality of this CD is excellent. I was NOT disappointed.
B00005JLD4|2.0|I have to say first of all that I enjoyed watching the film--as a fictionalized historical documentary, it works well. The scenery is amazing, the music (sounds, more like it) by Peter Gabriel is very nice, the camera work is good, and the acting decent, but there's really no story here at all. No characters change or learn anything, nobody learns any of the life lessons that drive fiction and drama. Things here just happen, one thing after another, like a plain narrative, and it leaves an empty feeling after the film is over.<BR>The actors didn't have much to work with, it seems, and their performances show it--I agree with the reviewer who says that they seem to be caricatures. Almost all of the white people are prejudiced, unfeeling bigots, and all of the aborigines are subservient, passive people who depend on the handouts from the whites. I don't know if that's historically accurate, but it is somewhat painful to watch.<br />As a historical lesson about the depths to which people in power can sink when they're convinced of their own genetic &quot;superiority,&quot; I would highly recommend this film. As a movie, a story that compels the viewer and helps us to learn more about life, I wouldn't recommend it at all--there's simply no story here.
B00005JKQZ|3.0|A Beautiful Mind is Directed by Ron Howard, and stars Russell Crowe in a critically acclaimed performance as John Nash, a mathematical genius struggling to overcome schizophrenia, in this `based on a true story', triumph over adversity tale.<br />Playing the mentally or physically ill has always been a fast-track to critical and Oscar success. Since 1945, approximately 20 actors and actresses have received Oscars for playing people with some sort of disability including most recently; Dustin Hoffman (Rain Man), Daniel Day-Lewis (My Left Foot), Al Pacino (Scent of a Woman), Geoffrey Rush (Shine) and Angelina Jolie (Girl, Interrupted). However, Russell Crowe narrowly (and somewhat controversially) missed out on his second Oscar even though A Beautiful Mind still triumphed on Oscar night winning Best Picture and Best Director at the 74th Annual Academy Awards.<br />Much debate still rumbles on as to whether or not Russell Crowe deserved to win his second Oscar and whether or not his ill-tempered display at the British Academy Awards cost him his second golden statuette. With this in mind I was intrigued to eventually dust down the DVD my wife had given me for Christmas and to cast a critical eye over this (in many ways) controversial movie.<br />First off, let me start by saying that if you already know that John Nash is/was schizophrenic (and lets face it who doesn't?) then the surprise (and indeed) suspense element of this movie is already spoilt. For it is then easy to guess from very early on in the movie that Russell Crowe's character may be hallucinating and experiencing paranoid delusions. Having studied mental illness and worked with people suffering from schizophrenia another major problem I found with `A Beautiful Mind' is just how saccharine sweet it all is with the real difficulties of schizophrenia being somewhat diluted (if only it was that easy) in what is a very commercial film.<br />Of course, all Hollywood biographies tend to smooth out the rough edges but it is more than a little disappointing that many of the more interesting facts about Nash's life and his relationships are overlooked. For example there is no mention of the fact that his wife divorced and later re-married him, or his illegitimate and shizophrenic son (conceived with another woman before his marriage) or his alleged homosexual/bisexual tendencies, which saw him arrested in 1954. The last omission in particular leaves me to conclude that according to Hollywood morality and the screenwriter Akiva Goldsman (responsible for the lamentable Batman and Robin) it is okay to be insane as long as you're not gay.<br />That said however, there are some very good things about A Beautiful Mind and Russell Crowe is at the centre of most of them. For it is his often understated and considered performance that makes A Beautiful Mind a very watchable movie and lifts it above your average Hollywood fare. Paul Bettany and Jennifer Connelly in particular also offer fine support and it is always a pleasure to see Ed Harris in pretty much any movie. To be fair, Ron Howard also directs this movie skilfully if somewhat by the numbers and Akiva Goldsman's screenplay builds an interesting if somewhat commercial plot, which would be fine if it were not so sugar-coated.<br /><br />In summary, five stars should be awarded to Russell Crowe (and the rest of the cast) but otherwise this is a 3 star movie. Not bad, not brilliant, just typically Hollywood. Entertaining but not real life...dges but it is more than a little disappointing that many of the more interesting facts about Nash's life and his relationships are overlooked.

B00008H2LB|5.0|Linkin Park has blown me away again. For some reason, I feel that this album has more Mike Shinoda than Chester Bennington, as opposed the Hybrid Theory. It's a bit short, but all of it rocks. Don't Stay is one of my favourite tracks. It's fast, catchy, and has no rap. Somewhere I Belong has a much more futuristic feel, with a lot of electronic and rap. There is a good reason it is the hit single. Easy to remember, it can get stuck in your head, but can be listened to time after time and still be good. Lying from You is even more rap, with less \\"music\\", but is still pretty good. Hit the Floor has very catchy lyrics, although the chorus can get annoying. Easier to Run kind of reminds me of a mellowed out Crawling. Lots of rock and no rap, but kind of slow. Faint is kind of like Papercut. Fast, rappish, and stylish. Figure .09 is also full of rap, and can get tedious, but the chorus is one of my favourites in the album. Breaking a Habit reminds me of a mellowed out In the End. It's fast, but not too harsh. From the Inside is slow for some reason, but is pretty hard. The chorus is pretty good though. Nobody's Listening is like High Voltage. That is not an insult, if you have heard the original High Voltage on the Asian import of Hybrid Theory, not the [stuff] on Reanimation. The song is unique, but catchy as hell. Session is even better than Cure for the Itch. The turntable solo makes this instrumental truly shine. Numb is an excellent ending for the album. Hard musically, mellow lyrically, this is also one of the best tracks in the album. Overall, an excellent title that is way too short.
B000002IGV|5.0|Twisted Sister hit the Jackpot in 1984 with \\"Stay Hungry\\". They had Two classic, unforgettable videos that showcased youth rebellion (Who hasn't felt like that kid at one point? Getting fed up and wanting to toss your teacher/parent out of a window. Man, I sure did after taking B.S from my teacher in college last term, even hoping Twisted Sister appeared out of nowhere, but I digress) And as we all know, gained notoriety in the process, landing themselves on Tipper Gore and the P.M.R.C's \\"Hit list\\" of obscene musicians. <br />That said, it shouldn't overshadow \\"Stay Hungry\\" for what it is, pure, full-throttle metal at it's best. By the time of it's release, Dee Snider and the boys had been playing for about a decade, and it really shows in the brilliant songcraft and musicianship. <br />It's a shame that \\"I wanna Rock\\" and \\"Were not gonna take it\\" aren't anthems for my generation today, because they sound as fresh now as they did back then in 1984. <br />\\"Stay Hungry\\" also houses a few severely overlooked Gems, The Jackkhammer riff of \\"Burn in Hell\\", and the up-tempo \\"Don't let me Down\\" with it's fast tempo, chorus segment, and a pounding riff. <br />A few more favorites of mine are the sentimental \\"The Price\\". \\"The Beast\\" is about the beast inevitably approacing, and there's no way to stop him. <br />In closing I'll say \\"Stay Hungry\\" is a must-have for any self-proclaimed Metalhead, If you refuse to listen to this music and call it cheesy, you're missing out and doing yourself a grave disservice. If this by any chance describes you, pick up \\"Stay Hungry\\" today and expand your palette.
B0000028VT|3.0|Mariah Carey´s third album Music Box became one of the biggest albums of the 90´s scoring 4 huge hit singels and Mariah became a huge star all over the world.<br />Primarely Ballads. Music Box is a pretty good album. Her vocals are strong. The production is good. Usually it´s about love but some of them have good message. <br />Although I Won´t say that Music Box is a brilliant album that should be wieved by everyone however those who like this so called Diva music should check it out if you already don´t have it because it is a good album.
B00008H2LB|5.0|When I was first introduced to Linkin Park a year and a half ago, I was pretty amazed at how well they can mix different types of music for an awesome sound.  Somehow I went backwards, buying Reanimation first, then Hybrid Theory. Each album has a slightly different sound, but they are all amazing. When I caught the opening strains of Meteora, I was really in awe. At first I thought that Meteora had a little bit higher-pitched screaming than Reanimation or Hybrid Theory, but I loved it all the same. I would for sure reccommend this CD and all other LP albums to anyone who likes pop, rock,or rap. Those guys have gone to so much work to bring us some really cool tunes, so keep rockin!
B00005J6T0|4.0|True Blue was Madonna´s third album and what an album that was. She hit the charts with Live To Tell. She was no longer this boy toy chick she used to be. Gone were all the fake jewels, the skimpy outfits and the greasy hair and now was a sexy, young female with snowhite hair in cool clothes doing better, wiser and more mature music. The album contains 9 cool pop tracks. She collaborates with Patrick Leonard and Stephen Bray. Musically a lot better then her previous album Like A Virgin which was in my opinion her worst LP. The Music is more diverse and the songs have more quality and better songwriting. <br />Papa Don´t Preach. A song about a girl who grows up with her fateher. She begins dating a boy and finds out she´s pregnant. She has a tough time and does not know how to tell her father or knows wether she´s going to keep the baby. She decides to keep it. A great song that is dancable, catcy and has a message 9/10.<br />Open Your Heart. This is one of the best pop tracks ever produced. Danceable, catcy, well written and produced 10/10.<br />White Heat. A song that has recieved some airplay but has never been released as a single. Has a great hook to it and lyrics. 9/10.<br />Live To Tell. Madonnas second hit ballad. Her first being Crazy For You. Live To Tell is a great track. The melody is good. Madonnas voice is far for perfect but not bad. Musically it is the best track on the album. 9/10.<br />Where´s The Party. Your Average party song. Fun dance track but does not sound corny or cheesy and makes you dance and have a good time with 7/10.<br />True Blue. The title track. Supposed to have a bit 60´s feel to it. Okay song but not briliant by any means however has that little sparkle that helps it from being a total stinker 6/10.<br />La Isla Bonita. A Latin song. Although the song never hit no.1 like so many other Madonna´s songs. It has become one of her signiture songs. Musically a fantastic songs. Her voice raps around it and she sings it well. 9/10.<br />Jimmy Jimmy. The worst song on the album. Very cheesy track but overall decent not terrible. If this had been released as a single it would hav been a disaster. 5/10.<br />Love Makes The World Go Around. A fun track that reminds be a bit on Where´s The Party. It has a salsa feel to it and has good positive lyric to go with it. 8/10.<br />True Blue is not a perfect album but it is extremly good and showcased the Madonna was something else except a Boy Toy bimbo with sex on her mind. Also she hires the right people to work with her which is very important and they bring out the best in her and she helpes them to get on the next level. True Blue is among my favourite Madonna albums and to this day  I still regulary listen to it. Madge should be proud of this album indeed.
B00008S2VG|5.0|This is one of her better albums of late...if you liked &quot;Ray of Light&quot;, you'll like this as well.
0802130208|5.0|To me, someone who doesn't like this book, is like someone who doesn't like chocolate--just plain weird. This book makes me laugh out loud, and I read it every year. I love everything about it--the dialogue, descriptions, characters (who are total caricatures)and story line. I can't say enough good things about this book. I wish it was 300 pages longer!
0064409422|5.0|This book is as good as the Harry Potter series.  I liked reading this book so much that I am reading the other books in the series, such as The Magicians Nephew.  I would reccommend this to readers of all levels and ages.  You do not have to read the previous Narnia books to read this one because all the books have different characters.  I always hated reading until I read this book.
0385335482|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book. I thought it was a light and easy read. I enjoyed it so much that I read the other two Sophie Kinsella books. (Shopalohic takes Manhattan &amp; Shopalohic ties the knot). This book was a great book and I'd read it again!
0060506989|3.0|An interesting book, but I have read many others in the genre that were a better read. I picked this up after watching the movie, and I have to say that it was a good companion read, filling in the missing details from the film. Still, there are better alternatives to this book, unless you are an avid history buff who simply must have all the details.
B00005JKZ3|3.0|MIB II is a disappointment.  It simply does not have the originality of the first and everything is too predictable. Tommy Lee Jones looks like he's been on a bender in this one, too, and hasn't quite got it together.  This was a movie that could have been even better than the first, but it fails by a wide margin.

0375422307|4.0|This is the autobiography of a spunky, smart girl growing up in Iran, in the time of the revolution. At first, since it is done in a black and white cartoon format you may be tempted to think this is going to be a kids book. It's not. With each page you will become more and more afraid for the high spirited girl and her sophisticated, educated parents. Although she's just a kid, her questions and taste for Western music and clothes is dangerous. How long before the secret police come knocking at the door? How will it turn out? You've got to read the book.
B000005ILF|5.0|This album is in my top 5% of albums which I listen to on a consistant basis, so I would have to give it five stars.  Although the first and last songs are a bit somber, they tie in pretty well as a whole into this album.  I was originally excited about &quot;I'm So Happy I Can't Stop Cryin&quot;, but the more I listened to the rest of the album, the more it grew on me.  It's turned into a great album for a hanging out evening (not necessarily romantic) or a drive in the mountains.
B00005JLEU|1.0|I honestly can't believe that so many people liked this movie. My husband and I bought the DVD after reading many positive reviews that described it as &quot;wonderful,&quot; &quot;fanciful,&quot; and &quot;a family classic.&quot; We were horrified when we watched it, though. This movie is full of mean-spirited characters, violence, and scenes that would give a young child nightmares. The little girl who's the protagonist of the movie is basically abandoned by her parents and abused by most of the spirits she encounters. She does end up making friends, standing up for herself, and rescuing her parents from the spirit world, but it's not enough to make up for all of the negativity of this movie. There's no way that I will ever let my kids watch this movie. My husband and I thought it was just plain weird.
B00008S2VH|5.0|As in everything Madonna does, this album will make people talk..alot. <BR>American Life is totally different than any Madonna music you've heard before, it's more mellow, more intimate, warmer and it gives you an insight in Madonna's current state of mind but Mirwais repeated a lot of the effects used on Music, definitely for Madonna's next album, he needs to go or have very minimal participation, otherwise the audience will get tired of the same style over and over.<BR>1.American Life, the title track, even though many people have not enjoyed it, mostly guided by their [imitation] patriotism, the song has a great vibe and it's just amazing to hear Mo rapping.<BR>2.Hollywood, this has to be the Ray of Light of American Life, catchy tunes and chorus, it's a great song.<BR>3.I'm so Stupid, probably the most autoanalytical song in the album, Madonna rejects all that she once worshipped, to be like all the pretty people around her. It's also a dance tune.<BR>4. Love Profusion, GREAT song, kind of mellow but kind of fast paced, there is something about it that will definitely get you, the only thing that kills it is that it repeats the same \\"Ive got you under my skin\\" line over and over, they could have filled the gaps with some effects or another line.<BR>The rest of the songs are fantastic, my least favorite is Nobody Knows Me, there's something about this song that doesn't get to me.<BR>You must definitely hear X-Static Process and Nothing Fails..THE BEST songs in the album.<BR>And to all the Madonna critics out there...get a life, she has conquered the world again..so no matter what you say..This kind of modern life is for all of us Madonna fans.
B00000JLWW|2.0|Titanic is the cinematic equivalent of a pop-up fairy tale book for children, complete with cardboard characters and a plot that would be laughed out of Junior High. Its story and cast of Ogres and Heroes could be described as cartoon-like but somehow manages to be more two-dimensional and is so drawn-out that it seems the voyage is filmed in real time. It's astonishing popularity I can only credit to a world wide stupidity epidemic, perhaps passed on by ship's rats.<br />We start shipping water right from the start with the introduction of `Jack', the main protagonist. He is dressed in period garb but may as well have stepped out of a rap video for all the sense of 1912 he conveys. He sleeps rough every night yet manages to wash his blond hair daily. Funny about that. The rest of the crew and guests resemble nothing more than ones and zeros in the shimmering computer simulation we know the ship to be.<br />But hark! A lookout has spied something huge heaving into view - the iceberg, the real star of the movie, appearing at last? Alas no, it's James Cameron's ego steaming toward us, bent on wreaking havoc below the waterline. Armed with his deathly dialogue and with no way to pump out the bilge water of his drama fast enough, there is no escape and we are doomed to slide beneath the cold dark waves.
B00003CX95|3.0|You'll be looking in the wrong place for history if you watch, but it's fun - as a movie. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy a good gore-fest/love story like every other young male movie lover, but I'm also a historian, and I simply can't understand why movie makers can't just come up with original characters to tell their stories and not go about letting the masses believe that _this_ is factual. In any event, enjoy the movie, but read some honest history before you start talking about Wallace's &quot;fearless crusade against the English.&quot;
B00008S2VH|5.0|The music is worth it, but the &quot;enhanced&quot; &quot;limited edition&quot; is  not, so unless you want a nice box, and enhanced features that don't really do anything, just by the regular jewel box and save the ten bucks.
B00005JKPF|5.0|Having been more than a little disappointed with the lack of action in the first installment this movie did not let me down. The sequel improves on the original maybe three times over. The original X-Men have all returned, with Iceman having a more significant part, but the Brotherhood is missing Toad and Sabertooth (if anyone knows why please email me). The new additions to the roster are the fire-totting, hot tempered Pyro and the teleporting Nightcrawler. There is not a dull moment. From the assault on the White House in the opening scene to the Climax at the Weapon X facility in Canada. The basic plot is that Stryker has begun a campaign to destroy mutant kind and the mutants must unite to fight for their lives. One thing people who have seen the first one will notice is that this movie is much more brutal. X-Men and Brotherhood alike tally up a high body count. If your like me you were expecting cameos from Gambit and Beast, but unfortunately neither are anywhere in sight, but the movie does feature a short, but memorable, scene with Colossus. Expect larger roles for Colossus and Jubilee, who made a brief, non-active appearance. Comic Book fans will have a basic idea of what will happen in the next movie. Basically, go see it.
6305291489|5.0|Being a teenager, I am not usually into the Disney films, but once I saw The Parent Trap five years ago, I fell completely in love with the movie. The Parent Trap is about two girls, Annie James and Hallie Parker who come from two completely different worlds. When they meet at Camp Walden, it seems that they would be enemies for life. Soon after arriving, they figure out that they are twins. Annie had lived with her famous gown designing mother in London her whole life and Hallie had lived with her vintner father in Napa, California, so they decided to switch places and meet the parents they had never met. After trying to live through Camp Walden, lying to their parents about their identities and battling an evil step-mother-to-be, this movie has a fairy-tale ending that will make you want to watch this movie again and again.<BR>This is one of my favorite movies, still up to today. The actors are superb and the story line is unforgettable. Overall, this is a classic movie that will be remembered forever!
B00008S2VH|4.0|For the most part I enjoy this CD.  The lyrics are heart-felt, (but very specific to Madonna only) &quot;Mother &amp; Father&quot; being one of my favorites. <BR>Madonna should leave rap to the rappers.
B00008J4P5|3.0|Make no mistake, \\"Elephant\\" is an decent rock record; its songs are, for the most part, expertly written and astutely executed with bare-bones elements, an approach that requires a considerable level of skill. However, \\"Elephant\\" strangely has little replay value, a trait that I attribute to its prevailing sameness and limited scope. That is, the first listen provides a phenomenal thrill, something subsequent listens are unable to replicate.<br />Jack White has certainly grown as musician over the course of the Stripes' four LPs--after the droning, monotonous garage rock of his band's self-titled debut, he was able to broaden his horizons with more whimsical songwriting, piano and slide guitar, and artsy ambitions. And now, with \\"Elephant,\\" he seems to have reached his peak. He has created a record that combines the raw, rootsy feel of the delta blues and traditional country with the jumpy garage rock of The Stooges and Led Zeppelin, paying joyful homage with only a guitar, piano, voice, and drums. <br />White's amazing talents shine through on the amazing opener, \\"Seven Nation Army.\\" Armed with a faux-bassline, Meg White's assertive drumming, and Jack's best bluesy drawl, the track's creeping melody plasters itself to the listener's memory and provides an exciting journey throughout. While this is by far the record's highpoint, many of the other songs stand out as well. The Meg-sung \\"In The Cold, Cold Night\\" evokes Nico and the Velvet Underground while sounding like a cowboy's waltz through a Western saloon. \\"Girl, You Have No Faith In Medicine\\" has a killer riff and some truly inventive lyrics about medical remedies. \\"I Just Don't Know What To Do With Myself\\" takes the old Bacharach-David for a rollercoaster ride equipped with fuzzy deathray guitars and expressive singing.<br />Yet the highs on \\"Elephant\\" often struggle to overcome the many lows. The first listen to the album disguises these ubiquitous shortcomings in adrenaline-rushing audio thrills, but hindsight reveals a number of fundamental flaws that seem to spring from the Stripes' insistance on existing in the musical equivalent of the Great Depression.  That is, their simplicity and often openly derivative nature bogs down potentially great music.  For example, Jack's guitar playing is hotter than a flamethrowrer spitting out recycled Black Sabbath tunes, but it ultimately is only a guilty pleasure, nothing on the enlightening par of Hendrix's genre-bending virtuosity or Jimmy Page's soulful soloing. This most prominent shortcoming speaks volumes about \\"Elephant\\": it often struggles to overcome its status as a dilution of its influences.<br />More frustrating is the persistently limiting guitar-drums-eight-track aesthetic. While such naive simplicity has won the raves of many critics and fans alike, it has weighed down the artistic ambitions of the Stripes like an anvil. Imagine, for example, trying to pay tribute to such grand visual artists as Van Gogh and Monet using only the primary colors and one brush; your end result might be coherent and even admirable, but it pales in comparison to towering works of greater boldness and complexity. And while I will concede that some of the techy, overproduced music of today is garbage, there are plenty of modern records (some of them made this year, such as Blur's \\"Think Tank\\") that outshine the retro-vibes of \\"Elephant\\" Put simply, the Stripes struggle to find enough variations on a simple theme to keep things interesting: the similiar guitar drones of \\"Black Math\\" and \\"Little Acorns\\" disguise sloppy, underdeveloped songwriting; the punk buzz of \\"Hypnotize\\" sounds unimaginatively similiar to the megahit \\"Fell In Love With A Girl\\"; and the album closer is a fraction of song that has, beneath its fleeting humor, very little to offer.<br />It is hard to create varied and daring art with a severely limited palette; only a few bands have been able to create masterworks using only music's primary colors. The White Stripes are not yet a great band, but the most frustrating aspect of their existence is the fact that they could be a savior band if they would only open themselves to new musical avenues.  Their humour (the overwrought \\"Ball and Biscuit\\" is actually a satire of the cocky attitudes that dominant society, according to a SPIN interview) and songwriting skill (the stomping \\"The Hardest Button to Button) speak volumes of their talent level.  But while their dedication to simpler times is somewhat admirable, it often oversimplifies their songs and leaches them of enduring colour.
B00005JKPF|5.0|Consider the first X-Men film a plot progressing set up, because from the first opening scene in X2 your thrown head first into one of, if not the, best comic to film adaptions of all time, and one of the few times a sequel out do's the original.  Almost all of the first film's entire ensemble cast returns: Patrick Stewart (Professor X), Hugh Jackman (ever perfect as Wolverine), Ian McKellan (Magneto), Halle Berry (Storm), Famke Janssen (Jean Grey), James Marsden (Cyclops), Anna Paquin (Rogue), and Rebecca Romijn-Stamos (Mystique) are all back.  Also, the film goes more in depth with Iceman (Shawn Ashmore) and Pyro (Aaron Stanford) and introduces us to beloved characters Nightcrawler (Alan Cumming who turns out to be nearly perfect in the role) and Colossus.  The storyline finds the X-Men months after the events in the first film, under siege by General Stryker (Brian Cox) who has his own agenda for mutant kind.  Eventually the X-Men must team up with Magneto to stop him, and this is where the film shines.  Director Brian Singer was critiqued quite a bit when it was said that the first film wasn't action packed enough; well, he made up for it here as X2 is action packed from beginning to end and the film pushes the limits of it's PG-13 rating.  The performances are great, and while Jackman is his usually terrific self as Wolverine, he isn't the focus this time around and we get to see Berry more developed as Storm, Romijn-Stamos gets more screen time as well, and Janssen is better now as Jean Grey than anyone could have ever thought before.  The special effects are nothing short of incredible; from Wolvie popping his claws to Deathstrike (Kelly Hu) popping hers, to Colossus' body turning to steel to Pyro's fire spewing shootout with the cops you will be in awe of the special effects wizardry.  The only complaint here is that with the exception up towards the end of the film is once again Cyclops is a criminally underused character.  Marsden is a good actor and Cyclops is a very interesting character and it is a shame he has gone so underused.  All in all, X2 is much better than I could have ever hoped it to be, and this is undoubtadly one of the finest comic to film adaptions of all time.ps is a very interesting character and it is a shame he has gone so underused.

B00006JJ1O|5.0| t.A.T.u embodies a power, an emotion, a sincerity in their music that no other artist does. Teens across the world can relate to their music, there are some who will say &quot;Eww&quot; to it, but the vast majority will say, &quot;Hey, I can relate to this.&quot; And through this music teens are offered a strength, a way to know others feel the same thing, face the same situations, and they thrive on this. They should. They find courage in this, so when they do face the world with whatever revelations about themselves they have, they aren't afraid--or if they are, they have more courage than fear. <BR> t.A.T.u's music is a masterpiece and speaks to the heart and soul of today's youth. Their sincerity is indubitable. I recommend them to everyone.
B00005ASOI|3.0|The murder scene in the beginning of this movie is the highlight. Other than that the movie drags. The imagery is pretty cool too. If you are sensitive to bad acting I wouldn't get it either. But then horror films are not known for great acting.
B000067CPX|5.0|I believe that this is by far the best album of their careers so far. Every track has the potential to be a number one hit. It also has more than the average number of tracks for an album. The lyrics and overall tunes are just mind-blowing, signalling their intentions to stay at the top of the music world for a very long time to come.
B0000024RZ|4.0|Bob Dylan's The Times They Are A-Changin' sternly rejected the romance and optimism of most popular albums of the sixties. On this disc, Dylan all but put aside his streaks of wittiness and tenderness and his knack for rallying the crowds (\\"When the Ship Comes In\\" and the title anthem being exceptions) and focused his peerless song-writing skills on spiteful confrontation. Times is an album of bleak social commentary (\\"With God on Our Side,\\" \\"Only a Pawn in their Game\\"), accounts of romance gone bitter (\\"Boots of Spanish Leather,\\" \\"Restless Farewell\\") and tragic story-songs (\\"The Ballad of Hollis Brown,\\" \\"The Lonesome Death of Hattie Carol\\"). The album, like its more varied predecessor, The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan, presents a catalogue of endlessly covered classics. Times surely continued to cement Dylan's place as the best songwriter of his generation, but, take as a whole, it can be one bitter pill to swallow.
B00006AW2G|5.0|Personally I've never really cared for the original Honky Tonk Women since hearing it from Forty Licks, but Country Honk from Let It Bleed is leaps and bounds better. Long live Country Honk, everybody, cause that song is certainly one of this albums very best. In addition to Monkey Man and heck the whole album is worthwhile. Also, by the way, I've never had any trouble listening to this album on my computer. People must have some awful old machines with Windows ME or earlier still on it, or they must not know what they're doing, because Let It Bleed plays fine on my computer which is a fairly modest Gateway 700 series from way back in 2000 with only an 800mhz Pentium III processor and a 32mb TNTM64 video card in it, with 384mb RAM and a fairly small 40gb 7200rpm hard drive. I also have Windows XP Home Edition on it with the superb Windows Media Player 8. Basically my machine is more than 2 and a half years old with some upgrades on it, and I can still play all of my cd's fine on it, including both my hybrid/SACD discs, this one and Pink Floyd's The Dark Side of the Moon. I just don't see the problem with it playing at all, unless like I said you don't know much about computers or your computer is pretty ancient, but then again my computer's pretty old and it still plays anyway, so who knows? Anyway, don't let certain people persuade you not to buy this glorious album because of their computer mishaps.
B000021XS0|5.0|This album is a prime example of Dream Theatre at it's best. The riffs, drum solos, pianist solos are all amazing.  More proof of how underrated Dream Theatre is.  My all time favorite track on this rock-opera type album is Home, despite contradictory reviews.  It's lyrics are amazing, and the music itself is Grade-A Dream Theatre.  Also, there could not be a more perfect end to the cd/story than Mike Portnoy's ending drum solo.<br />Now, having said that Dream Theatre is underrated, it remains obvious why.  These are not radio/mtv/vh1 songs.  These are not the sort of song that you have playing in the background of a party.  These songs require special attention for full appreciation.  Nor am I speaking solely for Metropolis 2, the same goes for all of Dream Theatre's albums.  They do not have many 2-3 minute songs, and those that they do have aren't as amazing as the longer ones.  One cannot be talking to friends and fully appreciate Petrucci's amazing guitar riffs, or Mike Portnoy's ridiculously good drumming.<BR>I myself find it difficult to listen to this music with a fellow Dream Theatre fan, because as we are talking about the lyrics or trying to figure out a riff, we miss a lot of other things!<br />I gave this cd a 5 star comparitive rating.  I compare all of today's other music to Scenes From a Memory (and Images and Words, and Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence, etc.), and with the exeption of a some, everything else seems so pale.
B00005JLD4|5.0|Watching movies like this is never easy.  It is a period in Australian history that needs to be told and openly discussed.  There are many books written on the &quot;Stolen Generation&quot; at the  moment, and because people just don't read like they need to, the movie is an excellent source of information.  It has hopefully opened the door to an issue that still needs addressing.  The Australian government refuses to apologize for this ugly time in history.  We can only hope that history never repeats.<BR>This is an excellent movie with an astonishing group of young aboriginal &quot;actors.&quot;  It is heart wrenching and, at times, difficult to understand how this can go on in a civilized society.<BR>As an Australian living in the U.S. for the past 13 years I would just like to say &quot;SORRY!&quot;  In the truest, purest form of the word - Sorry!
B00008PW3Q|4.0|There are several moments on Say You Will, the first studio album by Fleetwood Mac's most famous line-up (minus Christie McVie) in sixteen years, when you have to say \\"Wow, they've still got it!\\" Stevie Nicks' \\"Thrown Down\\" and \\"Silver Girl\\" are ballads a la \\"Dreams\\" or \\"Sara\\" that are about as subtly dazzling as those two classics. Meanwhile, \\"Illume\\" finds the singer at her most delightfully cryptic and intense and the title track is one of the most catchy songs she has ever written. Lindsay Buckingham, who produced the album, reminds us of his penchant for unconventional, yet enticing, sonic textures on danceable \\"Miranda\\" and towering \\"Red Rover.\\" Buckingham shines as a songwriter as well. \\"Peacekeeper\\" and \\"What's the World Coming To\\" are two of his best-ever compositions. Meanwhile, the rhythm section of John McVie and Mick Fleetwood is as dependable and proficient as ever. Still, Say You Will, does not fully return Fleetwood Mac to their former glory, due to the absence of the female McVie among other reasons. Phil Spector-ish overproduction plagues tracks such as \\"Bleed to Love Her,\\" \\"Come\\" and \\"Everybody Finds Out.\\" When the lengthy album is finished, though, Fleetwood Mac have proven themselves once again creatively fertile. Most classic rock reunions are (deservedly) greeted with a chorus of \\"It's just not the same.\\" This one comes close.
B000069AUI|5.0|I love Radiohead, alright, I'm very familiar with their music. And I love Coldplay, and know all of their music. Coldplay hasn't been around as long to mature fully, but where they are at this point is higher than where Radiohead was when they were on their second Album. Yes, I understand that they are original and experiment, but their music does sound rough and like static. Oh, they are so mighty for never touring, blah, blah... Coldplay is just as good and soon will be better. I think you always slam Coldplay because you can't deal with the fact that Coldplay may have them beat. Listen to &quot;Bigger, Stronger&quot; by Coldplay off &quot;The Blue Room.&quot; That should shut you up for a while.

B000068PQ0|5.0|There are two types of great concept albums. The first are story albums in which the listener follows an intriguing plotline across a spectrum of songs. The Wall and Tommy are examples. The second type are new-twist albums in which the underlining storyline emerges and submerges, but that is unimportant insofar as the concept allows compelling variations of an artist's style. Red-Headed Stranger and Ziggy Stardust are examples. The Flaming Lips' Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots, which is indeed a great concept album, falls in the latter category.<br />As a new-twist album, Yoshimi is a broadening of the Lip's style, which was redefined on their previous release, 1999's flat-out masterpiece, The Soft Bulletin. The stunning meta-soundscapes are back and so are the epically poignant, yet effortlessly beautiful lyrics (\\"Do You Realize??\\" is perhaps the most moving and powerful song the band has ever recorded). The underlining theme, which, as the title indicates, describes a Japanese girl fighting a swarm of dangerous robots, brings a sci-fi element into play. \\"One More Robot/Sympathy 3000-21\\" tells of an android whose \\"circuits duplicate emotions.\\" \\"All We Have Is Now\\" is about a man from the future who casts new light on how precious and limited life is. And the title track is a surprisingly straight-forward anthem for the title heroine. Sure, the specifics are outlandish (anyone turned-off by the outlandish should listen to another band) but the universal themes of responsibility, struggle, despair and humanity sparkle through. Sprawling, individualistic and chopped full of moments that would be delighting even if taken outside the underlining theme, Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots is everything a new-twist album should be. The Flaming Lips have released two masterpieces in a row.

B00006RU5B|5.0|As a longtime Rage fan, I was initially skeptical of the pairing of Chris Cornell with the former Rage members (minus Zack de la Rocha).  I needn't have worried.  One listen to their hypnotic first single, &quot;Like a Stone&quot;, and I was hooked, though I didn't like the whole CD much on first listen.  However, I kept playing it, and now I can't stop.  In the space of a few weeks I have the whole thing memorized.  Cornell's vocals fit perfectly with the amazing musical work of Tom Morello, Tim Commerford, and Brad Wilk, and all of Audioslave's songs are as intelligently written and performed as Rage Against the Machine's were, though they now have less of a political agenda, which I appreciate.  It makes their music much more accessible.  &quot;Audioslave&quot; should prove to be one of the best albums of the year and deserves a long shelf life.  I'm excited about what's to come from Audioslave.
0385504209|3.0|I purchased this book after hearing rave reviews on NPR (Todd Mundt (SP?) Show).  I was pretty disappointed.  It's really discouraging what passes for good fiction nowadays.  This last winter I read Edith Warton, Eveylyn Waugh, Chaim Potok and Imre Kertesz, really wonderful writing that touches on the human experience.  The Da Vinci Code, and much of the top selling fiction, seems to me to be only a step or two above romance novels in the drug store.  As a previous reviewer has said, the Da VInci code is a good beach read.  Just make sure you borrow a copy. I wouldn't spend money on it.
0140131558|4.0|Paul Auster burst onto the literary scene in the mid-eighties with The New York Trilogy, a series of experimental detective novels (or should I say detective-style novels as only one features an actual detective). In the first installment, City of Glass, a wrong number draws a hermetic novelist into mentally disturbed man's conflict with his religious fanatic father. In the next, Ghosts, a private eye named Blue is hired by a man called White to spy on the isolated Black. In the final episode, The Locked Room, a literary critic searches for a childhood friend who has disappeared, leaving behind a wife and child and a wealth of extraordinary, unpublished fiction. After each tale's somewhat cryptic ending, the truths behind the shady events are still mostly obscure and so is the piece's general meaning. Both of which are especially disappointing given the amount of suspense Auster builds-up. The author is often accused of being clever for clever's sake and is easy to understand why. But if those are your concerns, you are missing what makes these books truly special: atmosphere. Mixing detective noir with postmodern surrealism, Auster paints eerie netherlands that make the reader readily accept the most bizarre circumstances in his fiction. Everything the New York Trilogy lacks in substance, it more than makes up for in style.
B000066NW0|5.0|For her first CD, Avril Lavigne really did a nice job.  Out of the 13 song only one doesn't make my top list.  Her first hit, Complicated, is a good one to sing along to.  I'm With You is a song that shows a different side of this rocker.  I was happy with it from Day 1.  Don't even hesitate to get this CD because you will be soo incredibly satisfied with her songs.  I can't wait till her next album comes out (rumored) this year!
B00005JKN9|5.0|Before I start my review I want to note that I do not feel this movie is a 5 star film. Moreso a 4 star film. I am only giving it 5 stars because I want the avg. costumer rating to be higher. Now, on with my review.<br /> Martin Scorsese's \\"Gangs of New York\\" is a movie I'm sure many will argue about concerning whether or not it's one of his best. Well, lets for the moment say it's not one of his best. Then I feel, it is his most impressive and visually stunning movie. It's probably his most ambitious. \\"Gangs of New York\\" does have a grandioso feel to it. It's one of the rare times when a Hollywood movie wants to tell a story and actually be about something. That though is not unusual for Martin Scorsese. To many he is the greatest living filmmaker.<br /> \\"Gangs of New York\\" starts off with a \\"war\\" sequence that is as harrowing as the opening moments in \\"Saving Private Ryan\\". It's not for those with a weak stomach. Make no mistake about it. This is a violent picture. Many might say it has too much gore. But, to these people, what exactly were you expecting? Here's a movie dealing with 19th Century New York. A time when people were at a civil war. Hate filled the air, and were you expect a nice good hearted fairy-tale? I'm sorry but you'll be disappointed.<br /> In the opening scene Priest Vallon (Liam Neeson) leads his troops of Irish Americans against \\"Bill the Butcher\\"'s (Daniel Day-Lewis) troop of \\"real\\" Americans. As the Butcher likes to say. Vallon has a son, Amsterdan (Leonardo DiCaprio) who witness this war. At the end of it, Priest Vallon dies. What's to become of Amsterdan a small boy, without a father? He is sent away, but, naturally can never forget the sight of seeing his father killed. He plans revenge and will wait as long as he has to. This is the set-up.<br /> When Amsterdan does get older he will of course head back home to find \\"Bill the Butcher\\". Things have changed since he was a boy. It's a new world, and it seems like it's \\"Bill the Butcher\\"'s world. He seems to rule to five points of New York.<br /> It's when \\"Gangs of New York\\" hits this part of the movie it reaches the tone that will be played throughout. \\"Gangs\\" is really a very impressive movie. There is such craft clearly seen. The movie was done with such passion and understanding by a man who truly loves the history of New York. If you can't appreciate this movie strickly on those reasons alone, than I doubt you have any real love of cinema. It's those things besides acting that make the movie what it is. The cinematography, the art direction, the costume designs, & the production designs. All of these things added together give the movie what it is going after.<br /> Is \\"Gangs of New York\\" for everyone? Of course not. Nothing in life is 100%. But, I do feel people should make an effort to see it. Even if you didn't like the movie at the very least you can say you saw it and explain why you didn't like it. Most I think will enjoy the movie. And maybe as time passing on, people will have a kinder reaction to the movie.<br /> The movie also stars Cameron Diaz, in what I felt was one of her best roles. She has really surprised me. I honestly felt the woman can't act. But than she does a movie like this or \\"Vanilla Sky\\" and shocks you. She plays Jenny Everdeane. John C. Reilly plays a small role \\"Happy Jack\\". And Jim Broadbent plays William \\"Boss\\" Tweed, yet again, another small role.<br /> Bottom-line: One of the best films of 2002! A movie of craft and ambition. So, it might not be Scorsese's best, it is still one of his most impressive films.world.

0375414053|4.0|At times, I found this book really frustrating, because it seemed liked no one considered that there might be other options besides the mom working full time or the mom staying home full time. For example: Kate makes more than Richard, and they pay the nanny more than what Richard makes. Why not just have Richard stay home with the kids? But noooooo. Men are too muddle-headed to manage the lives of children, so that option is never even considered! But Kate does have a point about part-time work, as I am discovering: you get sucked in to more and more work (or you get hopelessly placed on the mommy track). Anyway, despite my frustrations with the lack of options--or maybe because of them--I was drawn into the book. I enjoyed the humor and the pathos, and I recommend this for all working mothers and those who have to work and live with them.
B00008DDXC|5.0|I'm very pleased with this movie.  It sticks to the book very well.  The special features aren't that exciting, but the movie is so good, I don't even care.
0446608955|1.0|Sorry, I'm not going to give you a plot summary here. There are already about a jillion of those for this book. On to the analysis...<br />Actually, I really don't know why I bothered to read this book. I guess I'd heard a lot about how Sparks was a skilled writer whose romance novels were great, and I got it in my head that somehow the book might be better than the movie that followed it.<br />First of all, the writing is flatter than a pancake. The narrative goes on and on unremarkably, and Landon's tone seems devoid of extremely deep emotion at times when the page should be bursting with it.(Spoiler Warning) Once Jamie tells Landon that she has cancer, she declines extremely rapidly and the end of the book seems like an avalanche, as if it simply rushed toward a Hallmark-y conclusion.<br />More importantly, character development and creation was awful. Although the fact that Landon isn't nearly as much of a troublemaker in the book as he was in the movie, and that should have made his relationship with Jamie a little more probable, other &quot;relational faults&quot; and weakness present in the book made it almost worse than the movie. If anything, Jamie is even more impossibly saintly (and therefore grating) in the book. Also, Jamie and Landon never really seem to have a ton of meaningful conversation. Oh, sure, they talk about their future, their goals, and everything along that vein, but it all seems so forced and predictable. Finally, there is just a lack of chemistry between Landon and Jamie. Of course, I realized that this book was hardly going to be a steamy Harlequin, but their relationship seemed so hopelessly...demure. And Landon dribbles on pathetically about how beautiful Jamie's hair looks when it's loose. GIVE ME A BREAK. Bad writing, worse characters!
B00008S2VG|5.0|American Life is not Madonna's worst album (Music easily captures that crown, and even that's still four-star material), and yet it's not her best, either.  It is her most mature work, though, and it should have cross-generational appeal as a result.  As usual, a new Madonna album connotes sonic experimentation and reinvention. Picking up where Music's \\"I Deserve It\\" and \\"Don't Tell Me\\" left off, American Life is filled with acoustic arrangements and subdued instrumentation. Typically, it's like nothing she's ever done, and that's what sets her apart from many artists.  A closer look:<br />01.  American Life:  An somewhat ironical song about Madonna's material image and lifestyle.  You know the song isn't supposed to be taken seriously when the rap interlude kicks in (a la Debbie Harry in \\"Rapture\\").  This song is framed by a harsh synthesizer backbeat that doesn't mesh well with the acoustic chorus.  A poor choice for the first single.   6/10<br />02.   Hollywood:  An excellent song (and the second single) that juxtaposes sunny, bouncy arrangements with dour lyrics about the toxic Hollywood machine.  9/10<br />03.   I'm So Stupid:  Madonna does rock.  Like the title track, this is lyrically inaccessible for most listeners -- and it's not particularly catchy either.  6/10<br />04.   Love Profusion:  This is an excellent love letter of a song;  it is stunningly beautiful, the hook is superb, and Madonna's voice sounds vulnerable and hopeful, reflecting the lyrical content.  10/10<br />05.   Nobody Knows Me:  This sounds like a leftover from Music, but it's a damn good one at that.  This is a pure dance track (perhaps the only one on the album) that is destined to become a club hit.  9/10<br />06.   Nothing Fails:  One of the most beautiful songs Madonna has ever cut.  It will inevitably be compared to \\"Like A Prayer\\" -- but the heartfelt lyrics aren't as ambiguous and the production is more subtle.  The best track on the album, it would make an excellent single.  10/10 <br />07.   Intervention: The catchiest song on the record, this boasts an equisitely layered production, touching lyrics, and a killer chorus.  It screams \\"dance remix\\", and is a future hit.  10/10<br />08.    X-Static Process: A pleasant -- if not particularly notable -- ballad that is extremely touching.  8/10<br />09.    Mother And Father:  A song about the heartbreak of Madonna's early childhood, this is sung in a childlike voice (courtesy of a vocoder).  Showcasing excellent lyrics and production, this is the most danceable cut on the album, with a dazzling chorus.  10/10<br />10.    Die Another Day:  You either love this track or you hate it.  I'm in the former category;  however, it is awkwardly sequenced on the album, and it destroys the mood created by the stretch from \\"Nothing Fails\\" to \\"Mother And Father\\", which is organic and often quite moving.   8/10<br />11.    Easy Ride:  A perfect closing track, it lyrically brings the album full circle.  9/10<br />Overall:  9/10 <br />This is an excellent album, but it will no doubt be misconstrued and misunderstood (as Erotica was).  It contains some of Madonna's best music, but the unfortunate choice of \\"American Life\\" as the lead single has perhaps tainted the album's success.
B00006J3T4|4.0|The Ragpicker's Dream is another fine recording from former Dire Straits leader, Mark Knophler.  This CD takes on a more acoustic format so if you like the electric/Dire Straits sound you may be shocked and a bit dissappointed.<br />There are several captivating melodies.  The swing flavored Quality Shoe is a nice toe tapping tune.  The title track has a nice homey feel to it with a little holiday sentiment in the air.  A Place Where We Used To Live and Fare Thee Well Northumberland feature some nice interplay between the guitars and the piano.  Love the folky feel of the later one.<br />Its good to see musicians step out and grow.  Mark Knophler is certainly adding new elements to his repetoire and this makes The Ragpicker's Dream a charming CD.

B0000024RQ|3.0|Bob Dylan's second record, The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan, displays an intimate warmth.  It mostly consists of just Bob Dylan singing and accompanying himself on guitar and harmonica.  Many of the songs take on a political stance. After a while that can be a bit trying especially on some of the long and winding numbers(Bob Dylan's Dream, Talking World War III Blues, A Hard Rain's A Gonna Fall).<br />There are some interesting strumming stylings most particularly on Down The Highway and Corrina, Corrina.  The lyrics are quite captivating on such favorites as Blowin' In The Wind, Honey, Just Allow Me One More Chance, and Don't Think Twice, It's All Right.<br />Diehard fans and lovers of acoustic folk rock should check this one out.  As for me, I can recognize the beauty in several of the songs.  I just fine the all acoustic format and Bob Dylan's whiny voice a little trying.  But it certainly stands on its merits.
0060934913|5.0|I love this book, written by bad-boy chef Anthony Bourdain.  He starts the book like you'd make a roux, mixing together some butter and flour, slowly and surely cooking it together.  He gives us the background for what led up to his decision to become a chef, in an enjoyable but basically \\"oh\\" manner.  The warm milk hits the cooked flour at full-steam all of a sudden when Tyrone at the Dreadnought says to him after he complains about a minor mishap to his hand, \\"Whatchoo want, white boy?  Burn cream?  A Band-Aid?\\"<br />A Rebel with a Claw was born at that moment.  As Bourdain will tell you at the end of the book, his decision to become a chef has resulted in a right hand full of skin tags and bone barnacles.  On the way to Bourdain's inventory of his leather-winged, trauma-sprung appendage, we come to appreciate the thousands of details that make up the Restaurant Biz.  <br />The book moves from pasteurized pharmaceutical strength to fry-basket ionization pitch with the introduction of Bigfoot.  I mean, this chapter is the dash of psychotropic cayenne to the roux-based sauce.  Bigfoot is some kind of Mad Magazine-rendered, charismic, Take-No-Prisoners Restaurant Owner.  He is Why Tony become a \\"real chef\\".  He is the frying pan, the smoking oil, and the maniacal short-order cook frying Tony's brains like street-grade drugs.  Bigfoot was so all-consuming and awe-presuming that Tony got OFF drugs, at least enough to function to Bigfoot's high expectations.  Reading about Bigfoot loving to play dumb like a \\"sunbathing crocodile\\" before moving in for the kill practically drowned me in my own tears.  Real tears, not crocodile tears.<br />Tony's prose style is also like watching a crocodile, that when it moves, moves with fast grace.   The guy has written rhythm, probably just like he's got moves in the kitchen, with efficiency of movement and speed like a militant Merengue dancer.  There must be something to watching a chef in action.  I like my chefs male, just like I think men look better pitching a ball or playing licks on an electric guitar.<br />If people like Tyrone and Bigfoot had not somehow weaned Tony from himself, we would not have the chef or the book about the chef today.  Hurray for Cold Turkey Ego-Bashing.  Now, how `bout a nice Mashed Ego and Cold Turkey sandwich?  With spicy white sauce?
B00008J4P5|2.0|I checked this album out because everywhere I looked I saw critics heralding this as &quot;the perfect album.&quot;  It saddens me that what I heard on the album falls way short of perfect.  I want to like the White Stripes, I want to hear what everybody else does but with every listen I just don't get what all the praise is for. <br />After hearing the songs I don't yearn to hear them again.  Jack White sounds like a whiny Robert Plant, and too much of that makes it hard for me to get through a song or even listen to the lyrics because his voice is so grating. Furthermore, Meg's drum work is reminiscent of children banging on tin cans.  <br />&quot;Ball and Biscuit&quot; is the only song I could partially enjoy because it did evoke a little bluesy, soulful quality.  Unfortunately, that was the only song that I found on this album that didn't leave me completely unsatisfied.<br />Obviously, I'm in the minority with my views on this album, so I imagine many will go on to enjoy &quot;Elephant&quot; for years to come. I just hope one day the White Stripes will come up with a song or an album that I too will think is &quot;perfect&quot; and then I won't feel so confused by the praise.
0316666343|2.0|This book has all the emotional depth of an episode of Without a Trace. The characters felt contrived (except maybe Susie) and I couldn't relate to them at all. I was surprised to see all the glowing reviews because I have read much better books written recently.<br />Sebold has some great moments in this book, but she tries too hard to put in symbolism and metaphors that just don't work. Frankly, I didn't even like the title metaphor about bones connecting us because I was so irritated at how blunt it was. It felt like the book was trying to hit me over the head with the connection theme. The book ends up being so overly sentimental (particularly the chapter entitled \\"Snapshots\\") that, though I was curious as to what would happen, I wasn't sure if I could go on reading. <br />The elements of the plot don't flow naturally from the characters. When Mr. Salmon goes out into the field, for instance, his character had not been built up enough for us to believe that he would knock anyone out with a bat. And when Mrs. Salmon left, I could not feel any sympathy for her no matter how much of an oppressed housewife she was. I felt more sympathy for Laura Brown in The Hours and she didn't have half the possible reasons for leaving that Mrs. Salmon does. Mr. Harvey doesn't make much sense either. Sebold includes excerps about his childhood and how his mom made him steal and his unhappy home life, but I'm not sure why. They didn't make me feel any more sympathy for him. In fact, they made him into a very thin, flat character. <br />Susie was a delightful narrator--I especially liked when she recounts one of the sad tales of another victim who was lured into the back of a van and says \\"I like to think I wouldn't have gone into a van. Like to think it was my curiousity about how [Mr. Harvey] could make a hole in the earth that wouldn't collapse.\\" <br />If it weren't for the last third of the book, I may have given The Lovely Bones an additional star and recommended it to some ofmy friends, but right around that \\"Snapshots\\" chapter the book just spiraled into unbelievability on all fronts.
B000002H38|5.0|This is one of my favorite cds. If I feel tired or stressed I put this cd on and listen to the wonderful smooth voice of Anita Baker.  I can listen to Caught up in the Rapture, Sweet Love and No One in World over and over again and never tire of hearing them.  Now that Anita's come out of retirement I hope she records some new songs.  Love to listen to her she sings with such feeling.

B00005JA2B|5.0|Kansas's masterpiece in 1976 is not only one of their finest works, but one of the finest 70's rock albums. They beautifully combined mid-west pop rock culture with European baroque mood. This album also produced huge hit &quot;Carry On Wayward Son&quot; and &quot;What's On Your Mind&quot; and &quot;The Wall&quot; that you may have encountered through classic rock stations. But it is only the part of its appeal. &quot;Opus Insert&quot; can be your favorite cleaning music while &quot;Cheyenne Anthem&quot; will bring you back to your childhood memories with Disney parade like gaiety at the latter part. It should not be limited to late 70s rock fans for sure.
0385486804|5.0|Living the Self: A Book Review of Into the Wild<BR>\\"I wanted movement and not a strong course of existence. I wanted excitement and danger and the chance to sacrifice myself for my love. I felt in myself a superabundance of energy which found no outlet in our quiet life.\\"<br />Leo Tolstoy<BR>\\"Family Happiness\\"<BR>Passage highlighted in one of the books found <BR>with Chris McCandless's remains<BR> <br />Jon Krakauer, an adventure novelist, was asked by the editor of Outside magazine to write an article on the mysterious youth, Chris McCandless, who had recently been discovered dead in Alaska.  Krakauer writes for many national magazines and newspapers.  He became further intrigued with the investigation and story behind Christopher McCandless after the completion of his nine-thousand-word article published in the January 1993 issue of Outside.  He spent the next several years retracing Chris's past by visiting locations along Chris's journey and interviewing locals in which Chris had acquainted himself with.  Jon Krakauer is also the author of Eiger Dreams: Ventures Among Men and Mountains and Into Thin Air: A Personal Account of the Mt. Everest Disaster.  <br />This novel retraces the path of a gifted individual who disliked the common person's role in society.  Chris McCandless was from a well-to-do family, a brilliant student, a superstar athlete, and a young man of great ... character.  In the summer of 1990, after graduation with honors from Emory University in Atlanta, Christopher Johnson McCandless took on a new lifestyle.  He gave the [dollar amount] in his savings to charity, deserted his personal possessions, and burned the cash in his wallet.  Along with deserting the material-life, Chris deserted his birth name often traveling under Alexander Supertramp.  For nearly two years Chris ventured about the US before making his great \\"Alaskan odyssey.\\"  However, this adventure would be his last, for Chris was found dead four months later by a moose hunter.<br />Chris's emptiness in his societal life led him to desire a non-materialistic life.  Chris devoted his free time to solo road trips in which his family recalls Chris disappearing for weeks at a time without contact.  He was a very sociable person, but he also respected solitude and the outdoor life.  In a postcard sent to Ron Franz, Chris writes,<BR>...So many people live within unhappy circumstances and yet will not take the initiative to change their situation because they are conditioned to a life of security, conformity, and conservatism, all of which may appear to give one peace of mind, but in reality nothing is more damaging to the adventurous spirit within a man than a secure future.  The very basic core of a man's living spirit is his passion for adventure.  The joy of life comes from our encounters with new experiences, and hence there is no greater joy than to have an endlessly changing horizon, for each day to have a new and different sun.  <br />What drove Chris to exchange a prospective lifestyle for [end of life] by starvation in the Alaskan wilderness? Was he another individual uncertain about his life and destiny or was he a sane man living out his passion?  Well, you will have to make the decision yourself by reading Krakauer's novel, Into the Wild.
0688163173|5.0|Lehane, long a favorite author of mine, has completely outdone himself with \\"Shutter Island.\\" This was one of those rare books that avid readers pine for...the ones where the last page comes far too soon.<br /><br />Taking a dark and surprising twist on the standard mystery/thriller, \\"Shutter Island\\" lures you into its story, making you believe you're in for a pleasant and well-written mystery. Somewhere around 2/3's of the way through, you begin to realize that you've been taken to a place you never expected, like the middle of a creepy, dark woods, and left to fend for yourself. To say what this book is about would be to spoil it for anyone brave enough to venture in....so I'll leave it at: READ THIS NOW! You won't be sorry!
0375703861|4.0|White Teeth, maybe despite a couple flaws and couple of slower sections, is an amazingly entertaining book. I can see you there was so much excitement about this novel before it even came out. Read the first five pages, and see if you're not laughing and actually caring about Archie. (I will tell you that if you don't find that section of the book interesting, just put it down. It's not a book for you.)<br />What's great about it: The prose and dialogue is so quick, witty, ironic, etc... You get carried along by the humor of the ride, even if some of event in the scenes aren't your favorites. The characters are at times hilarious, sometimes maddening and sometimes loveable, and their situations are heartbreaking and life affirming.<br />I know, that doesn't sound like it makes all that much sense. But I don't know that real life is all that much different. <br />White Teeth is not for everyone's tastes (as you can surely see from the mixed reviews here), but I do think there's a little something to take away for everyone. I have to think of the last scene in the novel, which is so brilliant and funny and uniting (and which I don't think a lot of readers get to). White Teeth can be a fascinating look that the postmodern world.
B00000ILDF|2.0|This movie is the second worst in the series, the ending of alien 2 offered so many grate chances to make a good alien 3 sequal. But David Fincher had to make it a boaring, depressing movie like he allways does with all his films. <BR>I do think alien resurrection is worse becouse the guys who made that movie had no idea what the alien &quot;Spirit&quot; was about and made a movie that looked nothing like an alien movie too me. I think fincher did a little better then that, but not much better.
0385504209|3.0|I had mixed feelings about this book as I have been a long time reader of the various themes that are weaved into the story, particularly the big Church &quot;secret&quot; that was the focus of &quot;Holy Blood Holy Grail&quot; in 1982.  This perhaps killed the real punch of the book, my fore knowledge.  Brown did some intense research for this book and I did enjoy how closely aligned his information was with what I had known to be true, or at least as true as these sorts of topics can be.  After a time I became annoyed with Brown's technique of walking the reader to an important fact or discovery in the plot, and then delay it for a chapter or two, sometimes even presenting the imagery that the character was looking right at this new tasty morsel of plot.  That got old with me very fast.  Such techniques are suitable when they aren't used so frequently:  That reminded me of the only Stephen King book I &quot;tried&quot; to read.<br />It at times read more like an educational essay on these various topics and themes for the reader new to them.  As I said, already knowing about Templar and Grail legend, secret societies (the Illuminati vs. the Church is the focus of Brown's earlier book, &quot;Angels and Demons), etc. This book did not change my view of what the Grail legends might be about, another reason TDVC failed for me.<br />All in all, this book was a fun read, but it was not a masterpiece by any stretch of the imagination.

B00005JKPF|5.0|The X-Men 2 movie followed the plot of the comics (allocating characters in to the story with excitement, and believable reason) much better than the first. The story started out and spun from scene to scene which kept the audience on the edge of their seats. It seemed every time an X-Man killed someone the audience would cheer. The story was great and moved along, and even though the plot (a death machine that Xavier can use to kill everyone on the planet) was a little \\"out there,\\" it was followed with a Saga that definitely dwarfs the idea of the \\"Cerebro.\\" I believe the next trilogy (you can't use the Phoenix and expect to fit it all into one movie) will be the last X-Men movies ever made simply because the X-Men are outdone so easily. This movie was astonishing, with that one exception or question. How are they going to incorporate the Phoenix, (as it was so shown at the end) and other galaxies in other X-Men movies? I believe the ending (and bear with me here) made this movie lose the awesome realism it was somehow given throughout almost all of the entire film.
0385486804|2.0|i gave this a 2 rating because i felt the author tried to take his very good newspaper/magazine article and expand it a bit too much into a novel. at times this book went to places that really never held my interest.
B00005JKN9|4.0|When I left the theater after seeing this movie, I didn't like it at all. I still think it's not a good movie, because it's very violent. However, it made me think, what Scorsese tried to say, and here's my conclusion: Scorsese took the most heroic and tragic time in America's history, the Civil War, and shifted the attention from the war itself, to an almost forgotten, or unmentioned event: the draft riots in New York. He shiftted the attention from \\"America\\" or \\"American soldiers\\" to the immigrants, that were draffted with no choice.<BR>He is basically showing the other side of the civil war: how could the north be united if even New York wasn't united? There wasn't a general agreement about going to war, and the soldiers didn't volunteer to draft, they didn't have a choice. Yet, it doesn't make the war less tragic or less heroic.<br />I think he's also trying to show us the other side of America: America represents Democracy, Freedom, Equality, Justice, and yet, in this movie, it represents it as the exact opposite. It shows Violent, unequality, forced draffting and no justice. Americaof this movie is corrupted, ignorant, selfish and opressing, and yet, it's ok. A country can't be perfect, all the countries have skeletons in their closet, it just seems that America or the Americans had forgotten the dark sides of their past, and without admitting the truth, one shall never be free. <br />It's irellevant how historical this movie really is, because it is not telling us about history, it's telling us about America today, and how it remembers. In the end of the movie the hero said \\"As If We Were Never Here\\", and that is the essence of the movie- America rathers to forget the darker sides of it's past, and this movie is a remindment.
B00008PW3Q|5.0|Say You Will is an awesome CD. It's also a tribute to Stevie and Lindsey's incredible talents and abilities as singers, songwriters and musicians. Say You Will is a tribute to coming full circle. FM's popularity shot through the roof when Stevie and Lindsey joined the band and now Say You Will is a return to those days. <br />This album is awesome for Stevie's songwriting and singing talent and for Lindsey's incredibly inventive and experimental musical approach. Combined, Stevie and Lindsey's talents result in 18 expertly crafted songs. <br />I think Say You Will is the best FM album for many reasons. This album is a testiment to the fact that Stevie and Lindsey haven't gotten stuck in the past. They have evolved gracefully and they have changed. Say You Will IS NOT Rumours and I say thank God for that. Rumours was great, but that was 25 years ago. <br />... Say You Will surprises me in it's richness and it's depth. It surprises and pleases me with its anti-war statements and social commentary. It surprises me with the clarity of Stevie's voice. It surprises me by proving once again that Lindsey really does know how to produce Stevie's songs. <br />All of Stevie's songs are excellent. I'm sitting here trying to decide how I would rank her songs on this CD and the honest answer is that they are all great. \\"Everybody Finds Out\\" is noteworthy for its emotion and anger and for its instrumental arrangement which shows a sophistication not usually found in FM songs. \\"Goodbye Baby\\" is all about Stevie's incredible voice, as is \\"Silver Girl\\". \\"Destiny Rules\\", \\"Thrown Down\\" and \\"Say You Will\\" all have infectuous melodies and lyrics. \\"Running Through the Garden\\" is a great rock song. \\"Smile at You\\" is a song known to many Stevie fans because it's been circulating as a bootleg. It is so good to hear a production version of the song that is all polished. And \\"Illume\\"...what can I say. This is a beautifully crafted song about the raw emotion of being trapped in NYC during the events of 9-11. Stevie is a talented storyteller!<br />Lindsey opens Say You Will with \\"What's the World Coming To?\\". From the first few drum beats, I could tell the Mac was back. The social commentary of this song along with \\"Ed Murrow Turning Over In His Grave\\" and \\"Peacekeeper\\" are truly timely with the war in Iraq and the news coverage of the war. \\"Miranda\\" and \\"Come\\" are great examples of Lindsey's talent. I have to admit I'm not sure what \\"Red Rover\\" is all about but I'll assume it is political with it's references to red, white and blue. \\"Steal Your Heart Away\\" and \\"Bleed to Love Her\\" are both wonderful love songs. <br />The bonus live tracks are great for the simple fact that as much as I like Lindsey's production of this album, I happen to believe that the sign of a great group is their live performances and FM has always been great. <br />So, in closing...there is no such thing as too much Lindsey or too much Stevie. FM has changed and evolved over time and have proven just one more time that this is not a test...this is real. Rumours was not a fluke...because FM has done it again. <br />Say You Will is every bit as great as Rumours...only different.
B00005UW9T|5.0|I was absolutely blown away when I saw this film! Fox has emulated Disney, not altering the formula but noticably increasing on the quality of the end result.<br />The storytelling is magnificent. Naturally it is not historically accurate, but that comes as no surprise. The adaptation is liberal, and creates a very different story than the historical account. By removing a lot of the grimness of the revolution, the filmmakers could create a sparkling and grandiose mood to place their story into.<br />The songs and score are of a caliber Disney has not matched to date, although I confess that the Alan Menken / Howard Ashman team of The Little Mermaid and Beauty &amp; the Beast comes very close. The music was written in the tradition of the Broadway musical, as Menken and Ashman did, and sounds exceptional.<br />I was especially impressed with the animation. There are no scenes where a particular character is draw badly, so scenes where the characters do not maintain their proportion to other characters, and no continuity errors. The drawing style is very similar to the older Disney - Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty, and that crowd.<br />The characters are believable and entertaining; there are no &quot;awkward moments&quot; where a line seems badly written or placed, the songs are integrated perfectly into the dialogue, the layout work is exquisite, and the use of 3D technology is stunning and smoothly integrated. And Fox picked all the right people for the roles.<br />Overall, this is an incredible film, even more astonishing considering it was Fox's first attempt at an animated film. And it's not just a children's film, as animation is too often considered; it is a family film: anyone can see and enjoy it. Smashing!
0790731002|4.0|If  you  love  movie  villians,  comic  book  style  action,  over  the  top  situations  then  BATMAN  FOREVER  is  for  you!  I  could  care  less  about  the  overly  lighthearted  duo  of  Batman  and  Robin,  I  just  like  this  movie  because  of  the  deliciously  over-the-top  villains!  Jim  Carrey  is  halariously  energetic  \\"brain  wave\\"  The  Riddler(  was  that  mind  controlling  \\"box\\"  invention  some  kind  of  cheesy  attempt  at  social  commentary?  ).  And  even  better  is  Tommy  Lee  Jones  as  the  once  lawyer  turned  maniac  splitpersonality  Two-Face,  who  is  always  funny  to  watch  laughing  at  his  own  jokes(  \\"nothing  like  a  case of  bad  gas!\\"  )  and  ranting  every  time  \\"The  Bat\\"  gets  away.  He  has  this  coin-toss  trademark  that  defines  his  character.  If  anyone  reading  was  as  amused  as  I  was  at  Tommy's  performance,  do  yourself  a  favor  and  buy  Natural  Born  Killers:  Director's  Cut  because  he  is  just  as  if  not  more  over-the-top  in  that  movie  too.<BR>  The  only  thing  I  have  against  this  movie  is  that  if  they  wanted  to  get  into  the  mind  of  Batman,  they  could  have  started  by  not  having  corny/melodramatic  flashbacks!  Another  thing,  Robin,  I  just  don't  like  this  guy.  That  whole  scene  where  he  took  the  batmobile  to  the  mean  streets  and  fought  the  gang  and  kissed  the  girl  is  very  cringe-inducing;  this  guy  just  sucks.  Nicole  Kidman  is  hot.  \\"Was  that  over  the  top?  I  can  never  tell!\\"  The  Riddler's  best  line.<BR>SPOILER:  I  know  that  this  was  a  mega  big  budget  movie  and  they  can't  touch  upon  every  last  detail,  but  I  was  disapionted  at  the  showdown  of  Batman  and  Two-Face  for  one  reason;  when  Two-Face  flips  his  coin  and  Batman  throws  up  like  15  coins  to  waste  him,  where  did  Batman  get  all  of  those  coins?  I  know  it  is  just  a  silly  movie  but  come  on,  did  Alfred  say  something  like,  \\"take  these  coins  in  case  you  run  into  a  bubble  gum  machine  on  your  way  to  the  final  battle!\\"  They  should  have  had  some  scene  that  shows  Batman  loading  the  coins  in  his  pocket  and  saying  something  corny  like, \\"These  may  just  be  Two-Face's  weak  point,  I  better  take  them,\\"  because  simply  having  Batman  randomly  throwing  the  coins  just  doesn't  cut  it  for  me.  That  guy  who  played  The  Riddler's  boss  was  pretty  funny.  <BR>   Get  this  increasingly  over-the-top  movie  and  watch  it  again  and  again;  it  definately  stands  the  test  of  time!  If  you  get  any  other  Batman  movie  instead,  than  you  would  be,  \\"settling  for  the  Bronze!\\"  I  mean  really,  if  you  don't  watch  this  movie  then,  \\"you  won't  learn  nothin'!\\"

B000002A6O|5.0|And passion!  Recorded on the Space Titanic by a group of overwrought teenagers before they crash into the moon in a fiery ball of passion.  This is how it makes you feel, and it does it through a masterful use of unabashed expression, craft, power. This is no more pretentious and/or bombastic than the work of some cold minimalist artiste who is too cool to say I love you or flup off, but with a range so deep and wide that there are moments here other singers and writers haven't even attempted to duplicate for fear they would fall off the wire.  If you think this is just 70's schlock, I can only guess you didn't die too many times as a teenager.

0451457994|5.0|This novel is so enthralling and addicting, I read it in one day. I recommend this to anyone interested in expanding their own horizens. FIVE STARS.
0380729407|4.0|Something Wicked This Way Comes - Ray Bradbury<br />I am grateful to Stephen King for having brought this novel to notice in his horror fiction chronicle-critique `Danse Macabre' (which I will recommend to anybody who is even remotely interested in horror/fantasy media).<BR>The main protagonists of this supernatural adventure are the sunny Will Halloway and his companion and counterpart, the wild Jim Nightshade. The plot centers on how their lives are turned upside-down with the arrival of that very unusual sideshow carnival, Cooger and Dark's Pandemonium Shadow Show (God, this has such a Heavy Metal feel to it).<BR>If it were to be judged by its start-up this would undoubtedly be one of the best books ever. Bradbury in his element comes up with the literary equivalent of a Rick Wakeman solo. The words fly fast and furious, magically arranging themselves into such dizzyingly ornate and mellifluous phrases, sentences, paragraphs that almost threaten to drown the reader in their exuberance and beauty. This major portion of this book contains some of Bradbury's finest literary moments and as anyone who has read his work will till you, that is an achievement of no mean order. Characters like the Dust Witch and Mr. Dark aka The Illustrated Man are described in such vivid and astonishing detail as to strongly etch themselves onto readers' minds. You do not merely read, you see, hear, smell, taste, feel whatever the pen of Bradbury commands you to. This book bristles with parts that I will be happily re-reading for many months on.<BR>Wherein lies the catch? The plot after one of the best build-ups ever constructed grows somewhat loose with several potentially interesting supporting characters (Mr. Electrico, the Dwarf) given marginal footage. Although lavish description is used to paint what Stephen King describes as the `Apollonian-Dionysian' divide between Will and Jim, once the action heats up, this is pretty much left by the wayside, the boys rendered almost interchangeable in their personalities. The story, after a point moves IMO almost into the realms of the straight-ahead thriller format, although Bradbury's writing alleviates a lot of the conventionality and it is perhaps only the cynical bastard in me that finds it difficult to swallow the `Love Conquers All' driven denouement.
0446604844|5.0|This is absolute the best thriller I have read so far. Grisham's fan would love it too. Absolutely page-turning. It is better than even &quot;Last Man Standing&quot; and &quot;The Winner&quot;.
B000002J1S|5.0|There are a lot of progressive rock bands who write far out, mystical lyrics, about god knows what.  Genesis during the Peter Gabriel years were no exception, but they combined an art of British storytelling and fantastical characters that made the listener interested in what the singer was singing.  Peter Gabriels lyrics are amazingly good, the word choices and the ryhmes, the meter and the emotion from his voice are extremely powerful; he'll overtake you and bring you into Rael's fantasy/nightmare.  And of course you have the wonderful, descriptive sounds of Genesis, painting Gabriel's world with splendid color and life.  I wouldn't understand someone who dislikes this monumental double album, it would blow me away if anyone couldn't get into it; for me it's equivalent to watching E.T, Wizard of OZ, --something majestic and uplifting-- for the first time and not being overcome by the brillance of it's existance, and the fact that you actually experienced it.  Wow, just a spectacular achievement by middle-class prep-school kids from some England suburb.
B00008AY3L|4.0|I was well pleased when i heard this album was coming out. In the past i always seem to be disapointed when my favourite artists have released another album, i think i expect to much. I am pleased to say this album was not one of them (which i decided after the first 10 seconds of the first song).  Although not his best it is still a reall good album.  One thing i like about ben is his ability to change styles which this album shows, however this album could be said to over do it. One other fault it that it is over produced lacking the raw guitar and vocals of ben. <br />Although less folky and bluesy than his older material this is still a very enjoyable album.<br />Over all it is possibly more mainstream than others which can serve to make it easyer to listen to.
B00008J2DQ|4.0|This CD was great in some ways and dissapontng in others. The two main songs Straight out of line and Stand Alone are great singles, and some of the others like Faceless were very good, but the rest was kinda bad. This CD I trhought was definatley nothing like there older stuff like Awake or Voodoo. It seemed as if they tried going for a slightly less heavy metal/rock type of singing to a little bit more quieter and nice. Even though as I said it still has many good songs and I do still recommend you buy it
0066214122|4.0|Wow! This book was amazing. It was amazing how inorant some of the people were yet I still believe that that was the true nature of human kind. Micheal Cranton made it seem so real that it makes you think it may have already happened this is definetly a great book.
B000001FFJ|5.0|I have long loved Tom Waits, and have a host of his albums, but this gem of a record remains by far his best effort.  It isn't just that many of his best songs are on this album, but that virtually all of the songs are at least highly listenable.  The quality of RAIN DOGS can be seen in the fact that a large number of artists have recorded this album's songs.<br />Musically, the amazing arrangements sound like Kurt Weill meets Captain Beefheart meets a carnival barker meets a bottle of bourbon.  As the album begins and moves from \\"Singapore\\" to \\"Clap Hands,\\" you know that you are not dealing with a three-chords-and-a-cloud-of-dust performer.  What is stunning after the album's first few songs, however, is how lyrical Waits becomes as the album goes on.  For all the raucousness of some of the numbers, it is easily balanced by the beauty of songs like \\"Downtown Train,\\" the gorgeous \\"Time,\\" or the mournfully drunken \\"Blind Love.\\"  Waits employs a crack back up band, with significant guess appearances with performers like Keith Richards.  The star back up musician is, however, Marc Ribot, who as he so often does provides stunningly original guitar lines that embellish every song upon which he appears.<br />Lyrically, Waits has never been better, turning out one superb line after another.  Several of the songs read as more than decent poetry, and many individual lines pop out, such as (from \\"Time\\") \\"The things you can't remember tell the thing you can't forget\\" or, in the best line about being down, down and out I have heard, \\"When you're east of East St. Louis\\" (with apologies to East St. Louis).  Or what about this great line from \\"Blind Love\\":  \\"They say if you get far enough away/You'll be on your way back home.\\"  Even some of the less well-known songs on the album, like \\"Tango Till They're Sore,\\" are lyrically stunning.<br />I'm a big fan of Tom Waits, but while in his other albums I always find him at least interesting, I still find there are a lot of individual songs that aren't up to the level of his best work.  RAIN DOGS is Tom's best album partly because it contains many of his best songs, but partly because it contains absolutely none of his worse.  This is all the more remarkable given the fact that RAIN DOGS was one of the first albums to take advantage of the greater capacity of CDs to expand the number of cuts.  Despite the larger number of songs, there are no weak cuts and no filler.ngs that aren't up to the level of his best work.

B00005JKPF|4.0|To the film's credit, X2 does a sensational job at bridging the gap between believabilty and sheer nonsense.  It is often difficult for a movie such as this to walk a fine line without crossing over it.  Many motion picture writers and directors miss one very important aspect of filmmaking:  Reason.  You can fill a film with special effects and extraordinary characters, but if you don't have a good reason for why a character looks, behaves, or strives for something, then it is my belief that you are lost.  The sequel chooses to have more fun in the wake of sheer unbelievabilty, while maintaining plausible and often unexpected reasoning behind each action and character trait, and therefore is superior to the original.  Another credit to the filmmakers lies in the way they juggle an ensemble cast as large as X2.  The later BATMAN movies proved that just because you have a big name in a role, doesn't mean people will always go along for the ride.  This film manages better character development, in less time, with less familiar actors.  I have never picked up an issue of the X-MEN comic, and my only knowledge of the story comes straight from the two films.  But I must say that for as bizarre as this film is, it is very entertaining and, at moments, quite humorous.  I also spoke to a number of patrons after the screening, and all agreed that X2 was more enjoyable than X-MEN.  If you are a fan of the comic, I don't think you'll be at all disappointed.  And if you think the whole idea seems ludicrous, I think you may be surprised.
0316666343|5.0|This book is the best book I have read in a long time.  The realness of the story and the narration captures your emotions.  Its gut wrenching and beautiful at the same time.  I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a touching story.

When you say psychological thriller does that mean bizarre sexual fantasies are described?

I would NEVER, for example, loan this audio cassette to my parents or to my children or to my friends.
B00005JKPF|4.0|I thought the first X-Men movie was a mess.  I liked bits of it, particularly Hugh Jackman's performance as Wolverine, and some of scenes were electrifying, including the \\"cage\\" match and the train sequence where Magneto lifts Wolverine into the air and gives him a stretch.  What was wrong with it?  Tone deaf story-telling, for one.  I'd come to expect that from Bryan Singer.  After watching Apt Pupil, I had low expectations about his ability to know a plot hole if it smacked him in the head.  I was right.  The dialogue was mainly lame, as well.  Add to that a rather stupid story with inexplicable inconsistencies.<br />But enough of X-Men the first.  What of this effort?  It's a better movie.  Significantly so.  It still has big problems, and small ones (like Wolverine standing in the frozen tundra and exhaling with no \\"breath\\" to be seen).  But the dialogue is at various times snappy, funny, and energetic.  There must have been a new screenwriter involved, because X-2 has no lines that make you want to burst out laughing.  (Remember in X-Men when Storm and Toad have a dreadful exchange about the effects of lightning?)  The lightness of some of the lines provides a terrific counterpoint to dramatic and intense evil that the film depicts.  I, frankly, never expected a menace as dark and deep as Stryker and company, nor did I expect the fascinating twist at the end.  Frankly, one of the things that was missing from X-Men was a depiction of the vainglorious side of Magneto, in which his pride and arrogance go hand in hand with almost god-like powers.  This is a truly \\"magnetic\\" persona, one who can call and army of followers with his grand ideas and charisma.  McKellan does a star turn in this one (even though he still can't help but mumble some lines).<br />Jackman, as expected, is terrific (although his hair looks just plain stupid in some of the scenes--in what appears to be an effort to mimic the comic books; it isn't the hair so much as the silly appearance that detracts from the scenes).  Anna Paquin is as insufferable and whiny as in the first film.  Rebecca Romijn does a really great, nuanced performance as Mystique (not to mention a drop dead gorgeous scene where she appears as herself, without the blue skin).  Alan Cumming is wonderful as Nightcrawler, who comes across as closest to the selfless superhero mold.  And Aaron Stanford gets an honorable mention as a terrific Pyro.  Brian Cox makes a formidable villain.<br />I could run through the story problems--there are a few--and the fact that this movie could have been so much better.  But, I'm content to leave those points unmentioned.  Go in for a roller coaster ride with interesting plot twists, fun lines, and some great performances.  And then, for me, say a prayer that Halle Berry and Anna Paquin don't make it into X-3.  That, alone, would improve the franchise immeasurably.y appearance that detracts from the scenes).

B000066NW0|5.0|My fave is 'Anything but ordinary'. But EVERY song on this cd is wonderful! I love to listen to it in the shower/getting ready every day. Thanks for a great CD Avril!
B00008S2VH|5.0|This CD is quite different than anything you will hear in today's pop music.  In a way, it is like a retrospective not only of Madonna's career, but of different musical styles in general. These styles are perfectly meshed together in this vibrant CD. <br />The first listen I heard was on the MTV site.  It was nice, but a bit difficult to judge as a whole. It did no justice to the depth and the nuances that are on each and every track.  I was also a bit turned off by the rhyming lyrics of American Life until I processed it a few times and realized how relevant they are to her and to the &quot;American Dream&quot; which everyone is trained to think they are sure to attain if they play their part.<br />On some of the tracks, her voice reminds me of the early gritty innocene that it had and that was common in the early 80s pop scene. This is particularly true in the track Hollywood.  Other tracks remind me a bit of the electonic ballads of early Depeche Mode, but much more upbeat and approachable.  Love Profusion is one of my favorite tracks and goes along this style.<br />There is also a great deal of freedom and playfulness with her voice.  With some help from Mirwais, her voice totally boils over to a disco diva volcanic eruption at the end of Mother and Father.  <br />Although there is a lot of electronica texture and experimentation in every song, the acoustic vibe is also very present and seldom becomes overshadowed.  This will probably appeal to people that do not normally like techno and that were disappointed by Madonna's experimentation with electronica in Ray of Light and Music.<br />This album is a work of art.
B00005JKPF|5.0|Excellent, excellent follow-up of the first movie...more action. I loved BOTH films, but X2 was definitely a bit better. I look forward to the next one!
0385474547|4.0|At its deepest level, Things Fall Apart is a human tragedy. Okonkwo despises his father because of the shame his lazy ways bring to his family. Okonkwo determines to be nothing like his father. With the exception of the brief time in which he comes to love Ikemefuma, he succeeds. Okonkwo gains fame in Umofia for being everything his father was not: hardworking, a man of stature, and concerned with the business of the community.<br />Okonkwo's rejection of his father, Unoka, is an act of social self-preservation. It also becomes a form of self-hatred. His denial of the parts of his father that exist inside himself makes him famous and revered. It is also his undoing as a human.<br />On the surface all seems well. Under the surface Okonkwo is a boiling mess of bottled emotion and impaired judgment. His determination to not be like Unoka causes him to put public appearance over internal intuition. This leads directly to his slaughtering of Ikemefuma. It also costs Okonkwo whatever humanity he may have had.<br /><br />This incident robs Okonkwo of any ability to deal sanely with the changes taking place in his society. His rage breaks upon the immovable rocks of colonial power. In his final futility, he becomes totally unlike his father--who at least enjoyed life.<br /><br />The things Okonkwo's homeland of Umofia reveres in their \\"great men\\" (and they are all men) are things that lend themselves to the preservation of people. Qualities like strength, the ability to create wealth (yams), and adherence to social and religious norms are all valued.<br /><br />Okonkwo manically lives out these qualities in an attempt to not become a \\"failure\\" like his father. Though Okonkwo's heartlessness manifests itself a few times, and some of his fellow villagers notice it, his greatness is already established in his titles and past actions. The unease of others is set aside in acknowledgement of his actions.<br /><br />This position Okonkwo has achieved falls apart the first time with his accidentally killing another. Yet even here, after he has, so to speak, \\"paid his debt to society\\"--he is allowed to return, his status is intact. This return and the change in society that has taken place in the interim, leads to the second, permanent \\"falling apart.\\"<br /><br />Okonkwo returns to a society being reshaped by the principles and, more importantly, resources of colonialism. In the face of the vast wealth and power of the colonial government the basis for Okonkwo's greatness looks rather silly and pathetic. What are yams in the face of guns?<br /><br />Okonkwo's status dissolves into irrelevance as his society moves on. All that he has accomplished in his life washes away in the face of those who have more. The grass withers, the flower fades and Okonkwo's greatness goes with it.<br /><br />The two white missionaries who come to Umofia, Mr. Brown and Mr. Smith, represent two very different worldviews. One (Brown) is a true-blue, \\"the last shall be first, the greatest is the least among you\\" kind of Christ-Follower. The other (Smith) represents the masses who crucify the true Christ in the name of co-opting the ways and power of those who are in charge of the temporal world.<br /><br />Brown is a missionary with zeal for the lost. Not only that, he evidences a desire to help lift up the down-trodden of Umofia's society. In the face of aggression from the people of Umofia, he attempts to lovingly turn aside their wrath. In all this, Brown shows himself (by his love for others) to be a follower of Christ.<br /><br />Smith on the other hand is a lackey of the state. His concern is not the condition of the souls of the people of Umofia. His concern is that no one \\"rock the boat\\" of colonial society.  He has no inner restraint in dealing with the problems he finds in Umofia. The smallest gnat of a problem is met with the crushing hammer of the colonial power at his disposal.<br /><br />Of course there are more temporal dangers in truly following Christthan in debasing oneself before earthly power. Smith's ways show results, Brown's largely do not. The difference is in the audience they are performing for. I choose Brown's.<br />I give Things Fall Apart my heartfelt recommendation.before earthly power. Smith's ways show results, Brown's largely do not. The difference is in the audience they are performing for. I choose Brown's. <br />I give Things Fall Apart my heartfelt recommendation.

I like the chimney sweeper and one man band. I like the part of Mary Poppins or even Mr Bank and his woman-liberalizing wife and even the captain next door-- he reminds me of Captain Shotover of Bernard Shaw. Now that Harry Potter, The Worst Witch are so popular, winds are certainly blowing Mary Poppins' way too. I rank this right next to The Sound of Music.
B000087OR2|5.0|When I first heard Norah Jones' \\"Come Away With Me\\", I wrote that this is why music is such a great art, and how you can be amazed by something new. The album remains a fave of mine, more than a year after it came out.<br />This version comes with a bonus CD, and the question is whether it adds anything to the \\"regular\\" album. To which I say: YES! \\"Ruler of My Heart\\" is another one of those great mid-tempo tunes, with The Dirty Dozen Brass Band adding some great touches. \\"Cold, Cold Heart\\" is a great live version, a nice momento for anyone having seen Norah in concert. \\"I'll Be Your Baby Tonight\\" finds Norah in top form. \\"Peace\\" is Norah solo on piano, what a wonderful tune! Highly recommended!
B0000028RR|4.0|This is a very good cd, one of the finest rapcore has to offer. TOM MORELLO IS GOD! This cd is just really good. Zach De La Rocha can get annoying at times, but he still has a really cool voice. I've never been an advocate of Rage's political standpoint, but this can be overlooked. This cd has some of the coolest guitar riffs i've ever heard. I love every second of it. The only reason this cd doesn't receive 5 stars is because I think the songs could be a little shorter, they kind of drag on and on. Otherwise, a great recording. I'm not a big fan of Evil Empire or The Battle of Los Angeles, but Renegades of Funk is worth checking out, along with this release.
B00007M58G|4.0|(YHF Album: 5 Stars Bonus CD 4 Stars)<br />The YHF album of course rates 5 stars, and we dont need to go into details here. The question is how the bonus CD (6 tracks, 22 min) stacks up. It was at first supposed to be issued as an EP in the US, but that has been shelved--permanently (although it now is available as a free download if you own the YHF CD). The answer is that it is a mixed bag, not up to par to YHF.<br />\\"Camera\\" is a rockier (and distorted) version of YHF's \\"Kamera\\", and quite frankly not as good. \\"Handshake Drugs\\" is quite good. \\"Woodgrain\\" is a short tune (less than 2 min.), finding Jeff Tweedy solo on guitar. \\"A Magazine Called Sunset\\" is another short, yet beautiful, upbeat tune. \\"Bob Dylan's 49th Beard\\" is a song Wilco has played regularly live on the tour supporting YHF, and it is the best song on here. \\"More Like The Moon\\" rounds out the CD, a mid-tempo, reflective tune, with a beautiful accoustic guitar solo.<br />It is very instumental that Jeff Tweedy decided to leave these songs out of YHF's final track listing. YHF is so much more daring, and for that matter cohesive. In the end, the bonus CD is nice, but not essential, for anyone (like me) believing YHF is one of the best albums in recent memory.
B00008J2DQ|1.0|I dont know what album everyone else is listening to.  I have been a huge godsmack fan ever since they came out, and this is by far their worst album.  IT [IS WEAK]!  There are only two songs that are worth listening to, and the rest seem like they arent even trying. Their new drummer seems to have thrown the chemistry of the band off.  I had waited for this album for two years, and was disappointed beyond words.  Save your money for their next album, and forget this [one].
B000002BFZ|5.0|Being a huge Pearl Jam fan and having listened to all of their albums countless times, I can say with certainty that No Code is a unique, subtle, and beautiful record. From start to finish, it may be their best (and most underappreciated) work to date.<br />Packed with introspective songs and Eddie Vedder's soothing baritone, it delivers some classic songs such as Red Mosquito which has to have one of the best opening riffs I've ever heard. Other highlights are the laid back Off He Goes and the powerhouse Present Tense, one of my favorite songs by any band, period. And let's not forget the rocking ferocity of Hail, Hail...which features another classic Pearl Jam riff.<br />No Code is a very atmospheric album and listening to it, you almost feel like you're in the studio with the band. The songs aren't over-produced and each song is given room to breathe and affect the listener. It covers a wide range of musical styles and moods and to truly appreciate No Code one must listen to the record as a whole, not just a track here or there. In the end, the journey is well worth it.
B00005JL78|1.0|After reading many great reviews of this movie, I was very disappointed when actually trying to view it.  I found it predictable and cliched.  The scenes are depicted like all 'future' type scenes where the living environment is done in silver and black.  As if no one in the future likes to live in soft, comfortable environments.  I just think that's stupid.  I found the entire plot weak.  It was a little more harsh than it needed to be as well.  Cruise was fine, as always, but nothing that stands out.  Overall a real bummer.  Not worth buying in my opinion.
B0000026KQ|5.0|After what most consider a disasterous outing, Flash, Jeff really came roaring back with this one fully decked out with long time contributer Tony Hymas on keyboards and ex-Frank Zappa/Missing Persons drummer Terri Bozzio.  I found that if I put this on, I had to listen to the rest until it ended.  There is a real continuity and flow that makes each song blend so well together.  The production is good and the musicianship is top notch.  This would be among my 5 mandatory JB releases, which also includes Blow by Blow, Wired, There and Back, and Truth.
0790725657|3.0|I liked this film alot. The scenery and costumes were beautiful, and the acting was brilliant. I especially enjoyed the presence of Ermengarde and Lottie, two wonderful characters from the book who were not in the previous Shirely Temple version. However, I've noticed that the filmmakers borrowed some scenes from Shirley's film, especially toward the end. The climax of the film is very similar to Shirley's: The Indian servant sneaks into their room at night, decorates it all up nicely, and then later Miss Minchin comes in and blames the girls for stealing the stuff. She locks them in their rooms and calls the police. The girls attempt escape by going out on the ledge and into the window of the house next door. Sara makes it but Becky gets caught. Sara hides in the house (in the ST version she manages to get to the hospital) and, while still on the run, happens to find her father, who doesn't remember her. Just as she's about to be caught by the police, her father remembers her and comes to her rescue -- and all is happily ever after.<BR>The original story ends differently. In the book, the Indian servant comes back night after night with new additions and good food, and the girls' newly decorated attic room is never discovered by anyone else. The old man who lives next door is actually a very kindhearted gentleman, as opposed to the bitter, cold man in the film who hardly gives Sara a second glance. He secretly sends Sara some fine, new clothing and Miss Minchin, who believes Sara has some wealthy, distant relative, allows her to wear them and begins treating her more decently, even allowing her to resume her lessons in the classroom. One night, the Indian servant's monkey escapes into Sara's room. She goes over to the house next door to return it, and starts a conversation with the old man. Upon telling him her name, she finds that he is a friend of her father's who has been looking for her for two years. Although Sara's father really does die in the book, the ending is still very happy. While I enjoyed this film, I think the directors should have stuck closer to the original story than the previous film version. Otherwise, great movie.
B00005OAIE|1.0|Yes, that's right, amazing.  It's amazing how I just can't stop writing mean things about John Mayer and his miserable, superficial excuse for music.  It's amazing how I manage to hate him more with each successive single he releases.  It's amazing how he manages to sing as if he was born with no testosterone whatsoever.  It's amazing how many people out there seem to think anything with acoustic guitars and whiny vocals has &quot;substance.&quot;  It's amazing to see what kind of lyrics pass for &quot;meaningful&quot; these days.  It's amazing that &quot;Your Body is a Wonderland&quot; doesn't induce fits of mass regurgitation whenever and wherever it's played.  And most of all, it's amazing how my genre of choice, metal, gets bagged on as lowbrow by many of the same people who listen to this ridiculous drivel because the radio tells them to.  Seriously, I don't know what hurts more after hearing John Mayer, my brain or my teeth.
B00004W52U|5.0|op ivy are one of the best bands ever this a great album every song is great everyone should already have it
B00005UEAR|5.0|While this album has gotten a lot of credit, I don't think it's gotten anywhere near as much as it deserves.  It seems the title of \\"Best Dream Theater Album Ever\\" is almost reflexively bestowed on \\"Scenes From A Memory,\\" but with all due respect to that album and its advocates I have to disagree.  I've become a pretty ardent DT fan over the past year or so, and I have to say that \\"Six Degrees Of Inner Turbulence\\" takes the prize in my book.  \\"Six Degrees\\" manages to top its predecessors by combining all of their best qualities, resulting in one tyrannical titan of a prog-metal album.  Here, for those who might care, is my rundown of the three Dream Theater albums I own that were released prior to this one:<br />\\"Images and Words:\\" A great album with four high quality epic songs, but the rest (while good) are basically filler, and the two ballads are a bit on the overwrought side.  Also, James's voice is nowhere near as powerful as on subsequent albums.<br />\\"Awake:\\" A dark, heavy, and aggressive album where tightly focused songs abound and James's vocal power goes up a notch, but crippled by lousy production.<br />\\"Scenes From A Memory:\\" Their most musically extravagant, with oodles of jaw-dropping instrumental work from all involved.  James's vocals are stronger and the production is clearer than on the albums mentioned above, but the songwriting isn't as focused, especially in the second half.  It's still one of my all-time favorites, BUT...<br />I think \\"Six Degrees\\" is their best yet (excluding \\"Falling Into Infinity,\\" which I have yet to hear).  It has all the strengths of its predecessors and none of its weaknesses.  It's free from the filler material and ineffectual balladry seen on \\"Images And Words.\\" It's got infinitely better production than \\"Awake.\\"  And while \\"Six Degrees\\" is bursting with brilliant musicianship, it trades in the excess of \\"Scenes From A Memory\\" for more focused and memorable songwriting.  And listening to this album right after \\"Images and Words\\" should tell you just how much James has improved.  I mean, he was good ten years ago, but now his voice has become so much more powerful and assured it scarcely sounds like the same guy.<br />The powerhouse opener of this album, \\"The Glass Prison,\\" is in my opinion not only the best Dream Theater song I've ever heard, but quite possibly the best song ever recorded by anyone.  It's probably their heaviest, and it combines its heaviness with melody and rhythmic complexity in a manner that most bands wouldn't even dream of.  Not to mention, the lyrics are some of the most powerful ever written.  I've heard they deal with alcoholism, but they don't really HAVE to be about alcoholism if you catch my drift.  The song is written in such a manner that it could really be about confronting any problem from your past.  Moving stuff.<br />The classics don't stop there, either.  Slower, less extravagant songs like \\"Misunderstood\\" and \\"Disappear\\" rely more on atmosphere and melody than \\"The Glass Prison,\\" but the conviction in James's voice and the airtight musicianship makes them work.  \\"The Great Debate,\\" if nothing else, deserves props for being a fourteen-minute epic about stem cell research, but it's a great song in its own right.  The title song, which occupies the whole of the second disc, is forty-two minutes (divided into eight tracks) of sustained brilliance.  After the symphonic intro, it delves into hard-driving metal, dark alt-rock, and smooth balladry.  Few bands have the talent to pull off epics like this one, and perhaps fewer have the stones.  Fortunately, DT have plenty of both.<br />Of course, as \\"Six Degrees\\" is a Dream Theater album, the musicianship is stunning.  They may not beat you over the head with their chops as on \\"Scenes,\\" but I'm still constantly finding some intriguing, previously unheard nuances each time I listen.  John Petrucci just keeps getting better, constantly refining his approach.  His riffs are some of the most interesting out there, and perhaps no soloist can race through scales without sacrificing melody like he can.  John Myung and Mike Portnoy are a monstrous rhythm section, especially on \\"The Glass Prison.\\"  And special credit should go to Jordan Rudess, who along with Symphony X's Micheal Pinnella has revolutionized the way I look at keyboards.  I used to think they were a lame instrument used by dorky Eurotrash bands, but now I see how much they can add to a band's sound, even in metal.  Jordan can add depth and ambience to a song, but he's just as capable of turning around and spitting out a solo that will make your head spin.<br />So, there you have it.  Great production, great vocals, awe-inspiring music, brilliant songwriting, and crystal-clear production.  What more could you want?  I gotta say I'm really blown away by this album, and by the fact that DT are still challenging themselves to try new stuff and build on their already-considerable achievements.  Hopefully \\"Six Degrees\\" will get its own DVD soon, just like \\"Scenes\\" did.ing out there, and perhaps no soloist can race through scales without sacrificing melody like he can.  John Myung and Mike Portnoy are a monstrous rhythm section, especially on \\"The Glass Prison.\\"  And special credit should go to Jordan Rudess, who along with Symphony X's Micheal Pinnella has revolutionized the way I look at keyboards.

B00005T343|3.0|Hannibal is not a great movie.  It is not even a particularly good movie.  However, given that the movie was based upon Thomas Harris's wreck of a novel, the fact that the movie is fairly entertaining and not a total disaster is great credit to the talents in front and behind the camera.<br />Thomas Harris's two superb novels - Red Dragon and The Silence of the Lambs - gave birth to fantastic adaptations.  'Hannibal' on the other hand, was a ridiculously weak novel.<br />The worst thing about Hannibal is the way it treats one of today's best known literature and movie characters - Hannibal 'The Cannibal' Lector.  In previous books, Lecter had a mystique about him, an aura of terrible, invincible evil, but all that was reduced.<br />Firstly, the uncaged Lecter is no where near as menacing as the man behind bars.  When imprisoned, Lecter is a caged demon, a shadow that threatens mankind and must never be unleashed upon us.  But out of chains, he's an elitist, a sort of evil James Bond, a man who likes nice cars, good food and expensive wine.  Indeed, in the book, Claris locates Lecter by simply tracing the most expensive wine bottles in the US.  What a disappointment.<br />Second, Harris made Lecter the hero of the book, by pitching him against pedophile Mason Verger.  When facing a child rapist, Lecter, who 'merely' eats adults, is seen as a hero in comparison.  A 'good' Lecter is much less interesting than the heart of evil that he was in the previous installations.<br />Worst of all, Harris gives Lecter a motive.  It turns out (spoiler) that Lecter kills people because the Nazis during World War 2 murdered his sister.  What a cope out - the greatness of Hannibal was in his evil being inexplicable, as he actually told Claris in 'Silence', you could not reduce him to influences.  Harris completely sold out the integrity of the character by giving him the motive.<br />In Hannibal the movie, the production team wisely alleviated (although they did not entirely solve) all of these problems.  The scene in which Claris traces Hannibal by his wine consumption is gone and less time is spent on his fancy food intakes.  By downplaying Verger's pedophilia, Hannibal does not look that good in comparison.  Finally, the silliness of the motive is ignored completely.<br />Furthermore, the improved script features much more contact between Claris and Lecter.  The interaction between them is the heart of the story, and yet in the book, the only contact among them in some 400 pages is a single letter from Lecter.  Here the producers introduce several more communications between them, including a phone call in a very climatic scene.<br />From a technical point of view, the movie is well executed, with unnecessary scenes and minor characters from the book discarded, and great attention spent on the fantastic scenes in Florence, where Inspector Rinaldo Pazzi tries to outmaneuver Lecter, but end up outmaneuvered himself.  Those scene are not bad in the book, but Scott's wonderful sense of scene, and the amazing photography really brings the menace alive, and help preserve the aura of danger around Lecter.<br />But the movie again cannot completely disregard the novel, and the main plot of the novel is a fairly pedestrian cat and mouse story, where two parties hunt for Lecter, to results neither of them expected (but the audience surely does).  Try as hard as the producers do to escape the confines of the story, they just can't.  Most of the movie remains an effective, extremely well directed and acted, thriller.  That is all.<br />Then we come to the controversial ending.  After a lukewarm book, Harris finally comes up with an interesting premise and some powerful scenes. (Spoiler)  After Capturing Clarice, Lecter begins in an effort to turn her into his dead sister, using drugs, brain washing, and his own mental powers.  This is an extremely cool notion, which leads to the book's best scene - the infamous brain dinner.<br />In the novel, Hannibalcaptures Paul Krendler, an FBI executive who does all that is in his power to harass Clarice Starling.  In a gross but brilliant scene, Harris depicts Lecter opening Krendler's skull, and piece by piece taking out parts of his brain.  We read the breathtaking description of dinner conversation, where the three of them eat Krendler's brain.  With each additional piece which Lecter takes out and cooks, Krendler's speech retard more and more, and from a highly aggressive yet sophisticated person he becomes an agree, bitter, childish, and finally speechless person.  It is a terrible scene, but it is truly both shocking and amazing.<br />The movie, lacking the proper foundations for this scene, completely misses the point.  The special effects are so over the top as to make the scene unbelievable and not the least bit scary.  Furthermore, because the producers (wisely, in my opinion), deleted so much of the back-story, at this point they have no idea what to do next.  So you've got a little chase, some bantering between Starling and Lecter, as Scott rushes towards the ending credits.<br />Ultimately, the only way to have made a good movie out of 'Hannibal' would have been to completely rewrite the story.  Having to work with what Harris gave them, Ridley Scott and the rest of the production team salvaged as much as possible.
B000062YAZ|4.0|\\"Reign In Blood,\\" as any good metal fan knows, is almost universally hailed as a metal masterpiece, one of the defining moments (or to be more accurate, twenty-nine-and-a-half-minutes) of the genre.  Is this label justified?  Well, in my humble opinion: sort of.  The heaviness and impressive technicality are obvious, as Jeff Hanneman and Kerry King are rightly regarded as one of metal's all-time best guitar duos.  And since some of this stuff sounds shockingly fast and vitriolic now, I can only imagine what people hearing it in 1986 must have thought.  Still, I think the songwriting on this album got a bit lazy every now and then.  While it doesn't happen too often, there are a few moments where interesting structure is abandoned in favor of a speed-for-its-own-sake emphasis, and I for one don't consider that a good thing.  Fortunately, it doesn't happen often enough to keep \\"Reign In Blood\\" from being a great album.<br />The album is bookended by the opener \\"Angel Of Death\\" and the closer \\"Raining Blood,\\" which are doubtless two of the best metal songs of all time.  These songs highlight everything that makes Slayer such an important band in the metal pantheon: the blazing speed, the subtle tempo shifts, the insanely precise riffing and screaming leads of King and Hanneman, the maniacal drumming of Dave Lombardo, and the demonic growl of Tom Araya.  And while they may not be as overtly technical as some of the stuff that's come along in the past decade or so (think Meshuggah), the complexities of these two songs should be obvious to anyone who listens closely.  \\"Angel Of Death,\\" especially, is a downright disturbing song (and I mean that in a good way).  With its descriptions of the atrocities committed in the Nazi death camp at Auschwitz, the song gives me the chills every time I hear it.  And if I may digress for a moment, while some have said this song is pro-Nazi or anti-Semitic or whatever, I don't see where they got that idea.  I mean, if they wanted to glorify Josef Mengele's actions, would they describe him with terms like \\"sadist\\" and \\"butcher\\"?  I think not.  Slayer have always been about showing us the dark side of the world we live in, and while I can understand why some wouldn't like that approach, bombarding them with unfounded allegations helps no one.<br />Okay, now that I've gotten that off my chest, back to the rest of the album.  How is it?  Well, I think the first and last songs are the best, but there's some more great stuff on here.  \\"Reign In Blood\\" mixes all-out speedfests with slower, more rhythmic stuff, so just about every metal fan should be able to find a few songs they like here (of course, it should be noted that with this album \\"slower\\" still means pretty damn fast).  I tend to prefer the slower, chunkier stuff, so while I'm not a huge fan of songs like \\"Reborn\\" and \\"Piece By Piece,\\" I think \\"Epidemic,\\" \\"Postmortem,\\" and \\"Altar Of Sacrifice\\" are utter classics.  But hey, there's something here for everyone.  If you consider yourself a metal fan you need to pick this album up, if for no other reason than to see what the fuss is about.rify Josef Mengele's actions, would they describe him with terms like \\"sadist\\" and \\"butcher\\"?

B00004Z459|5.0|This CD is just mind-blowing. I like every song, and it's a good cd to play when you're just hangin out or you feel like jumpin around. This rock/metal cd is just, at a loss for words, \\"cool\\". Here's the lineup:<br />01 Papercut. great begining song. it has a good flow and just fills you with energy. unlike some other songs, this one keeps it's general rythm though the whole song, and no soft verse/loud chorus/loud bridge formula with this song. just loud all the way through. 8/10<br />02 One Step Closer. the first single, it's a pretty good song. not my favorite, because you get sick of it quickly. however, this song does exhibit chester's good vocals in the verses, yet the bridge can give you a headache. 6/10<br />03 With You. i have to admit, i love this song. ... also, this can be somewhat uplifting. 8/10<br />04 Points of Authority. this a good all-around LP song. this isn't as heavy as some other stuff, but you get clear vocals and a nifty intro. 7/10<br />05 Crawling. this is my favorite song. it just has so much energy that you can feel, and the message puts another coat of feeling on you. it's sad- but it's an awesome song. 10/10<br />06 Runaway. this is a great song, too. somewhat overshadowed by other songs on the cd, this one follows the formula of Crawling also. pretty good in my opinion, but after hearing Crawling, it isn't as good. 7/10<br />07. By Myself. this song is a heavy one. sometimes i just skip it, because it can annoying really quick. it's all screaming and a pretty depressing song on top of that. 5/10<br />08. In The End. this another of the best songs. this song has energy that you can feel. also, the music video adds a lot to it. it has thoughtful lyrics that are insightful. 10/10<br />09. A Place For My Head. this starts with an acoustic-like intro, then flows into one of mike's raps. the verse is well-done and then quickly booms into one of chester's mammoth-vocal style choruses. 8/10<br />10. Forgotten. like it's name, this song can beforgotten on a cd with Crawling, In The End, and Pushing Me Away. But that shouldn't stop you from listening to this rap and rock song, which is pretty cool. 7/10<br />11. Cure For The Itch. this is an instrumental song that's pretty cool. even if you're not a techno person, it's fun to hear. 6/10<br />12. Pushing Me Away. the last song finishes this great cd well. the music feels like a good conclusion to the cd, and the vocals are great. 9/10<br />overall: a great cd. buy it now!
0684833395|3.0|For me, there is something a bit too unlinear about this novel: it seems a compilation of character sketches interpersed with a general &quot;feel&quot; for the military at the time.  The pros are:  character sketches detailed and funny; and an occasional paragraph of great comedic brilliance, which are SO wonderful that one keeps reading hopeful for the next one.  The general anti-military feel for the novel was probably more attuned to the times in which it was written, we having seen in our times how necessary it is to have a military, and the noble sacrifices of military people.  On the con side:  the dialogue is unlikely in many places; the names of the characters very unlikely (as though pulled out of the too-creative hat); and a style that skims along a little breathlessly, as though punctuation amounted to grammatical error rather - what it really is - the finest point of style.  And yet on the whole it is that wonderful, cynical American sense of humor that pulls it all off, just as it does for other American novels, such as Iacovelli's Lily Snow, Cheever's Falconer, and Henry Miller's naughty and otherwise sterile novels.
B00006690F|5.0|This is the best cd by Eminem I think it has some pretty good songs such as Without Me, Superman, Cleanin' Ot My Closet and Sing for the moment the other songs I did not mention there pretty good songs too Eminem is a total gansta rapper this cd is really must cd I would recommend this cd to any one
B00005JLR2|4.0|Now that I've finally seen this movie on DVD, I regret having been among the box office throngs who DIDN'T turn out to make it the success it deserved to be.  \\"Treaure Planet\\" is truly wonderful!  Granted, the concept of old, tall sailing ships flying about in the vacuum of space is dubious at best, but it's an odd creative choice that settles in quickly as the strength of the amazing visuals sets in.  And that's just the beginning.  \\"Treasure Planet\\" quickly develops a well-plotted story that is not only characteristic of most (if not all) animated Disney movies, but holds up remarkably well to Robert Louis Stevenson's original \\"Treasure Island.\\"  The characters are also surprisingly appealing, and the story of Jim Hawkins finding a sort of surrogate father in place of the dad he never had with John Silver, who, naturally, turns out to be the villain, provides a terrific and genuinely emotional character arc with which to anchor the rest of the story.  As with all good movies, \\"Treasure Planet's\\" abundance of excellent story and character arcs are coupled with a perfect, very nautically-themed score by James Newton Howard (who, by and by, provided an equally great score for the equally underrated \\"Atlantis\\").  All in all, this is a movie that comes together far better than audiences obviously expected it to based upon the awkwardness of the theatrical trailers.  I was among those audiences, myself, but my love of every other movie from Disney's recent past got me to take a chance on this one, and I was not disappointed in the least.  Give it a shot, and I promise you'll enjoy \\"Treasure Planet\\" quite thoroughly!
B00006JJ1O|3.0|Sure, some people may say \\"Their lesbians, all they do is make-out on tv for attention\\", despite comments like this, their album is actually pretty good!  They gave good songs, but I gave it 3 stars because they have a remix to their track \\"Show Me Love\\" and all that they ahve that is different is extra sounds at the beginning.  I think that was very disorganized and only put together so they could add another song onto their album.  I also think they try to act like lesbians too much for attention and they say it in their \\"Malchik Gay\\" song.  They also have song titles in german and some lyrics in german.  It is just ok!  I also gave it 3 stars because some songs make you want o slit your rist, especially if the bahtos are in a car with you!
B00005JKPF|4.0|I very much enjoyed this movie.  The action and character development was well done, but there were a number of incidents that were not consistent with the comic book characters.  But to see your favorite X-men characters come to life, it is terrific.  There are some other well-placed, if not hidden, references to characters that may be to come (hopefully Gambit)

B00005JKPF|5.0|I just saw X2 at the theater, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. That being said, there are spoilers ahead, so if you don't want to know, stop reading now.<br />So what does X2 offer us? A look into the world of the X-Men that's even more in depth than the first one. Opening shortly where the first film left off, Wolverine returns to the mansion (with Cyclop's bike) with mutant hatred at an all time high after an attempt on the President's life by Nightcrawler.<br />With Jean and Storm tracing the renegade mutant, and Cyclops and Xavier heading out to find out what connection, if any, Magneto had, Logan finds himself babysitting the kids in the mansion.<br />Little do they know the whole event was orchestrated by William Stryker, a man who hates mutants. And with the Mansion unguarded, Stryker takes Xavier prisoner and launches an all out war on the Xavier Institute.<br />We finally get to see Wolverine cut loose, and he leaves bodies all over the place this time out.<br />Mystique, in the meanwhile, aids Magneto in his escape from the plastic prison we last saw him in, in a scene that highlights the use of his powers in a beautifully composed scene.<br />Recognizing a common threat, Magneto and the X-Men join forces to stop Stryker, in the meanwhile, learning more about the origins of Wolverine, and witnessing Jean Grey's powers rising in scope and effect (a prelude of things to come, if you've read the books).<br />Jean sacrifices herself to save the others, and the movie ends with a scene reminiscent of another sci-fi which I will not name, but I will say that it was also the second in its series.<br />All in all, a perfect comic book film, faithful not only to the source material, but also to the details from the first film in the series, with no continuity errors that I could find.

0316666343|5.0|This book was awesome.  It dealt with issues of teenage lives and how a crisis can effect them.  It also dealt with family and how you need your family to get through rough times.  This book was one of the best books I read in awhile.  I definately recomend to everyone.
0393314804|5.0|SO much better than the movie, I can't even begin to explain.  I've seen the movie countless times and read the book at least twice as many times.  It's funny, sad, disturbing, confusing, painful, and so well written that by the end of the book you love the characters and hate them at the same time.
B000089RVX|1.0|Record Company Meeting:  3:00 Monday afternoon.<br />MR. Record Company VP speaking:<br />&quot;OK everyone, have a seat.  I've come up with some ideas for the Evanescence album &quot;Fallen&quot; we talked about last week.  In speaking with the band, they are more than happy to make &quot;Fallen&quot; an album that sounds like a mix of Linkin Park and Sinead Oconnor, and the singer has hair! (chuckles from room).  Fallen will be a triumphant sucess as radio stations have agreed to play the single &quot;Bring me Back to Life&quot; over and over and over and over again until millions realize this is the next hip thing.  Those who actually care about talent and creativity will have no choice but to be subjected to it, no matter how bad it is to them, much like second hand smoke (more chuckles from room).  To be quite frank my friends, kids nowadays will buy anything we tell them to!  Isn't that obvious?  I think we all know it.  Fallen will make us all millions of dollars, thats all that matters right?  This meeting is adjurned until next week when we discuss the new Metallica! (aaawwws from room).&quot;

B00008H2LB|1.0|Dear Linkin Park:<br />Thank you for developing another mind knumbing talentless album such as your previous two realeases.  Meteora, much like your other records, is void of anything creative or inspiring, or even remotely interesting.  Meteora plays on the concept that radio LOVES sameness and uninteresting music, as do kids who dont understand the value of difference and the power of following your own path.  Meteora is the XMen of music, lots of flashy stuff but offering little in talent or value.  Perhaps most depressing, Meteora drains me of hope for any kind of heavy metal talent coming this year or any time soon, this fact enforced 100 fold by the fact heavy metal sellouts Metallica will be assisting in the sale of Meteora.

B000089RVX|4.0|Amongst the stuttering of my faulty CD player, I hear this CD. It's really not bad, one of my favorites. Of course most CDs have their faults. <BR>When I first popped this in to listen, I was very excited by the hit 'Bring Me To Life' that had enticed me into buying the CD. I had heard they were 'gothic' from one of my friends. I didn't hear it at first. Gothic? Nah! With lead singer Amy Lee's beautiful voice, and the lyrics written by Ben Moody (who also plays the guitar in this CD) this CD melts into your ears, unlike some 'gothic' tunes I have heard. <br />1. Going Under- ~4/5~ About 45 seconds into this song it kind of goes odd. Maybe it's my brain that's been demented by repetitive rhythms, but it just didn't hit me right. It's still a great song, the music is great, the lyrics are dramatic, and the vocals are very pretty and follow up with the lyrics in making them twice as dramatic.<br />2.Bring Me To Life- ~5/5~ I was very stricken with this song at first. 'What is this?' was the first question. I saw the music video about five times before I decided to really listen to it. I was in awe; this was such a deep song in every way. It's so rare to hear such a mixed song. The tough music, the beautiful vocals, and of course Paul McCoy of 12 Stones addition to it all. Wonderful song.<br />3. Everybody's Fool- ~5/5~ I LOVE this song. It's catchy, yet isn't empty. One of those song's I can only dream of writing. Again Amy Lee's voice is beautiful and the back round vocals are awesome. Hard core sounds of course. <br />4. My Immortal ~4/5~ Much softer then the others. I like it, since I can relate to it a bit, but it's not my type exactly. Very pretty song though.<br />5.Haunted ~4/5~ Musically this song is really perfect. However, the lyrics do kind of fly by me. They give me the creeps in other words. I am a very lyrical person, so my perspective may not be the most wholesome, but it is a perspective. The vocals are still very well done.<br />6.Torniquet ~5/5~ Thisis a very 'wow' song. The word 'wow' is what hit me when I heard it. It's a head bopping said, also a head thrashing, yet still has that deep void that swallows you when you hear it. The lyrics are simple yet still hold a very strong meaning. Powerful.<br />7. Imaginary ~5/5~ First off, I base this rating mostly on the lyrics. The musical part isn't as impressive as others on this CD. Neither are the vocals. All in all if you feel the same way I do but aren't as intrigued with the lyrics as I, then this is rated lower. <br />8. Taking Over Me- ~3.5/5~ Didn't intrigue me as most of them have. It feels kind of like a repeat though not. It just doesn't jump out of my CD player and grab me saying 'love me love'. <br />9. Hello ~4/5~ It's a very soft song, slightly sad, sorta boring. I still like it, I stick to my word, I listen to the lyrics first. The words' are pretty, and so is the voice that sings them...even though it kind of drones on at one part...<br />10. My Last Breath ~4/5~ I LOVE THE MUSIC! It's so AMAZING! *kiss kiss* The lyrics don't pull me in, and neither do the vocals. BUT the MUSIC is SPECTACULAR! <br />11. Whisper ~5/5~ I'm in love with these lyrics. Tremendously wonderful. Vocals are very mystical. The end thing is kind of freaky. I love it! This is a great song. Musically it's a little boring at first. <br />There you go, each song, what I hear from it all! It really is a great CD, each song has something amazing about it. I hope this helps you and has entertained you in some realm of your mind. To conclude my review, I found out Evanescence isn't really `gothic'; they are just very poetic in a dark manor.
B00008BRBG|5.0|Listening to music today it is hard to find stuff that is truly good, with substance.  With this album, after all of the years that have passed it is still a gem.  Copeland's drumming is great.  I never get tired of this album.  I am a big Rush fan as well, and the music has similarities (at times)--the great drumming, and Lifeson's guitar work at times is similar to Summers.  Also, I think this is the best Police album of all time.  By the way, when I pop this in, I never listen to Roxanne--so boring.  Its like when I pop in Moving Pictures, I don't listen to Tom Sawyer :-)
0375758992|4.0|There are currently 266 other reviews of this book available here, so I won't waste time revisiting the plot. The author tells her story in first person, with the insight and \\"wisdom\\" of the child she is throughout most of this book. The realities for her include  terrorism, alcoholism, depression, racism, death. But through it all is the love of family, strength of character, and the background of a very real Africa that few of us could ever know. Although the chronology is jumbled at first, the reader can quickly acclimate to the unusual flow of the dialogue and novel. But it is for this reason that I give it 4, not 5 stars. It certainly is a book that left me wishing for a sequel.
B000002N2Z|5.0|ahhhhhh, deftones. i dont think anyone will ever hear anything quite like this cd. here ill just talk about the music, putting aside who they are and what kind of music they play and all that [...]. first, this music works. i think that it definitely does what the musicians set out to do, and that is one of the most important accomplishments of an album. second, all of the songs stir up emotion of some kind in the listener. again, like the artists sought out to do. in this way the music is quite strong and powerful and ambitious. <BR>now the artists themselves. collectively a very very tight band. this band flows together like theyve been playing all their lives, and they practically have, so they have much more of a feel for what the capabilities of one another are. the guitars on this cd definitely do their job, just like the bass. just a groove to the sound on some of the songs that just works as well. both of them definitely show the precision of a band that knows what their doing. now the drummer. very awsome stuff. just enough complexity to make it very emotional and dynamic to the listener. the vocalist. emotional in a very slight, dynamic sense. the vocals are just naked. just really stand out and brilliant and they really hold their own in a sense almost no vocal effects just keep it simple. its intresting because as a band they dont need that here. really some amazing skill to some of the notes he hits with the clarity he does also. lyrics are one of a kind as well, as they paint a very abstract, broken picture that you just want to find out more about.  they never sound cheesy or forced, either, which lends to the personality of the album. lastly, to top it off, a turntablist makes appearences on a couple of songs, dramatically increasing the sense of atmosphere.  <BR>if there were to be any personal 'cons' of mine for this album, id have to say that the effect on the listener of each song is not varied enough to make this a cd perfect.  its definitely not to say that there is no polarity in terms of mood, its just that the songs on this album MAINLY (there are a few that definitely dont)tend to  restrain themselves to a certain mood.<br />from beautiful to scorchingly fearsome, the deftones really prove from this DEBUT, a debut even, that they definitely hold their own effect for whoever is lucky enough to listen to them with an open mind
B0000256VK|5.0|I hesitate to call this jewel Roxy Music's &quot;best&quot; album, only because I still thrive on the like of &quot;For Your Pleasure,&quot; &quot;Stranded,&quot; and &quot;Country Life&quot;. But it is certainly their loveliest work. Perhaps the tensions which had always underwritten their delivery and Bryan Ferry's edgy balancing between his own stylised detachment - in the end, all that chic can't hide the actuality that Ferry is the guy who'd shrink in a heartbeat if that elusive romance of his dreams ever said &quot;yes&quot; - and his band's bristling delivery (even in their most avant moments) had finally informed him that it wasn't the end of the world for him to stay inside himself and just let be. What &quot;Manifesto&quot; had only hinted, and &quot;Flesh + Blood&quot; hesitated to bring, &quot;Avalon&quot; delivers full force. (The title track is one of Roxy's most beauteous ballads; &quot;Take A Chance With Me&quot; should have been a hit single and would have blown a shaft of brooding incandescence into the early 1980s Top 40 if it had been given a fair shake; &quot;Tara&quot; is as haunting a set closer as you'll ever hear, with Ferry letting the mask fall all the way from his face at last; and, &quot;While My Heart Is Still Beating&quot; is about as harrowing an answer to their surprise success covering John Lennon's self-lacerating &quot;Jealous Guy&quot; as you could ask.) And the odd dynamic between Ferry's nervous elegance, Phil Manzanera's sweet-and-salt guitar phrasings (he was always the most underrated rock guitarist of his time), and Andy Mackay's idiosyncratic but sensitive reed work (this guy could have honked with the Coasters or shriven with the wildest of the free-formers and not dropped a beat), on top of some of the most well-knitted rhythm foundation they ever drew up, has kept this album as alive as its most illustrious predecessors, and maybe more so.
B00005O5CM|5.0|This has to b 1 of my fav movies of ALL TIME! The Stroyline...??<BR>It is about a beauty fanatic named Elle Eoods (Reese Witherspoon) who has a boyfrined Warner.

B000021Y77|5.0|I have not seen too many forign films. I had to watch this for my video class.  I was amazed of how intense this film is.  The camera angles are great and the music just makes it more exciting. Even though it stinks to read the subtitles, by the first scene you are [drawn] in and forget that it is in another language. A GREAT FILM
B00004XONN|5.0|...You know you're the best band in the world when your ENDLESS list of online reviews reads like a brain-powered \\"who can tinkle the farthest contest.\\"  I don't think a band since the Talking Heads has been this worthy of a large-scale battle of overconfident intellectualism.<br />Kid A is inhuman.  It's the emotion of mechanics, concurrently more than the sum of its parts, and all toghether mathematically impossible. it feels like a glossary of the things far and beyond us, painstakingly gauged and grinded until our ears almost except it.  its this tiptoeing the border between music and chaos that creates the feeling you will undoubtedly get if you listen with open ears and open fists.  to refine a wonderful Kid A commentary i read...<br />...that feeling might be put as something like watching yourself delivered as a stillborn birth, in reverse.<br />it has a circular track list, circular bass lines, circular square wave drones, and a sprawling chart of carefully orchestrated lines of notes that were fitted together and over eachother with a very specific principle in mind.  and while the music is dark and clockwork, yorke sings with no camoflauge for human error, making the music impossibly distant, but completely believable... just the like black hole at the center of our galaxy.<br />the album's tone, or theme, or story, or ghost... is unavoidably personal and reciprocal.  if you're looking for something in the music, you are guarenteed not to find it... and if you do find something, tell me, because i change my mind too often.  the less listenable tracks provide the contrast needed to bump your favorite songs on the album up into the 'im still working on it' category reserved for high-end theoretical physics.  and then, on the 95th listening, when you start to think that the sparse beauty you find on the album is only noticable because of its imprisonment in the rest of the sweeping darkness... that unlistenable track suddenly becomes wholly beautiful.  <br />you'll learn the words to the second track eventually... <br />you'll listen carefully to the mingus-esque sax disaster closing the 3rd track instead of wincing like you normally do...<br />you might feel obligated to defend the album.  you shouldn't.  there are more important things.  more important than radiohead at least.  i think the relevance of Kid A is... well its a reminder that there are important things in the universe, but they're all either so physically small or physically far away that humans have really nothing to worry about.  especially the fact that a band that bleeds anti-corporation and anti-marketing charges twice the cost of its album for a t-shirt and THREE times that much for a concert ticket. ...<br />enjoy it.  its your last chance for a while to be excusably hypocritical, and to speak in uncontrolable hyperbole.<br />you owe a lot to radiohead; so, to thank them, you should go steal Kid A off the internet.
B00008K7AM|4.0|Anyone who sees this movie will be pleasantly pleased with the wackiness and silliness of it all. The plot is light and fast paced and the jokes keep coming one right after another. Rob Schneider plays a criminal who switches bodies with a rude and mean spirited teenaged girl and the two desperately try to find ways to get back into their old bodies. I don't want to say anymore because to say too much would spoil the fun of the movie, but I think there is plenty of fun to be had with this movie. Anna Faris, an extremely talented comedic actress willing and able to do anything for big laughs, especially shines as Jessica's best friend. She, more than the quirky and mildly funny Schneider, is the reason to watch this film. A film that might tug at your heart a few times and keep you smiling from start to finish.
B00006RU5B|5.0|I never really liked soundgarden and RATM but this CD totally blows your mind away. No words can describe how great it is. It's like u get put in a freakin trance! MUST BUY
0723284075|5.0|My children grew up reading these beautiful little books. Our set is identical to the one pictured, only we bought ours in the early 90s. Now with one in college and one who is a \\"punk rocker\\" I can *still* get them both to curl up with me and read Tom Kitten or Jemima PuddleDuck or The Roly-Poly Pudding or their favorite...Ginger and Pickles. Amazing, but true. Both my kids treasure this collection in its lovely case and the set was a very wise purchase. After all, stories like this keep your kids close to you, it is almost a ritual, and a good thing! Other editions of these stories are fine, but there is something about the little books and the special case that creates a sort of magic. Well worth the expense...I *promise.*
B00008GKEG|5.0|Esta es la mejor biografía que he visto de The Beatles, las imágenes y la calidad del Sonido son Excelentes al igual que el documental en si.  Al mismo tiempo es algo que nunca me pude imaginar como seguidor de The Beatles  de que ellos mismos fueran a narraran su historia.  Considero que es la mejor agrupacion de Rock en Ingles, contiene mucha información.  La recomiendo para todos los nostalgicos y los nuevos seguidores como yo.<br />Jorge Mendez
0440234743|3.0|In The Testament, Grisham uses his usual style to keep the reader at the edge of his seat until the very ending, when I thought there are somewhat of a letdown.  Grisham books are known for the great endings, and this one was surprisingly missing.<br />The testament is a story of a billionaire that dies and his family fights for the inheritance, which he decided to leave to an obscure woman who is doing missionary work with Indians in Brazil.  The story is one of character, as we see this missionary resist the inheritance while the family is fighting legal battles in the U.S. to get the money.<br />What I liked the most was the overall scenery of the Brazilian pantanal, a large swampland in midwestern Brazil.  The imagery of forest and the adventure aspect of it what new, as I had not seen Grisham engage in adventure type writing (he does it well nonetheless).<br />Overall, I recommend this book, though I would first read The Partner, which I thought was substantially better.
6305633177|4.0|I couldnt give this 5 stars because the quality was pretty bad at times, even for a vhs, but by golly, its the only chance you will ever get to see cliff again. Bass playing the has influenced and stunned musicians for generations to come...for that it could almost get a 5
6305205620|5.0|this is as good as it gets, noit going to say much more than this is the dvd by which others are compared to, just amazing, couldn't get any closer unless you bought a ticket.
B00005JLSC|5.0|Chicago has to be the best movie musical ever made. Its not your traditional musical where people just walk down the street and burst into song, the music is all in Roxie Hart's head which makes a great movie for those who really don't like movie musicals (like myself). The only bad part is that it did not last longer. The best number in the movie has to be Cell Block Tango.
B00005JLT5|5.0|Above all, The Pianist is an excellent film. I waited until after the Oscars to see it. So I won't pretend that I was an early, unbiased fan. I saw it because I heard so many good things about it and because it won several awards. It was described to me as, `A better and more personalized version of Schindler's List.' So I went in expecting a quality film. And I was not disappointed. I tried to be as objective as possible when viewing it and I don't think the Oscar hype had an effect on me.<br />The film had some fairly clich&eacute; elements. Such as the standard animalistic Nazi soldiers who parade around and randomly shoot Jewish citizens. I also thought some of the scenes in the ghetto were heavy handed. As though our faces had to be rubbed in the filth before we would understand the despair and evil humiliation that the Jews withstood. But these problems are small and they didn't really effect the film as a whole. And the `psychotic Nazi soldier' clich&eacute; was countered effectively by the Nazi officer who showed compassion in the end. The biggest positive element of the film was the way it showed the best that man can be while also showing the worst that man can be. It really made me sit back and question many things. It brought up ethical issues like `might makes right versus universal individual human rights' and `when is killing right or wrong and who truly decides?' The film had an intellectual quality that raised it from simply being good, to being excellent.<br />If you are looking for an expertly crafted film about the survival of a real man in an unimaginable situation, The Pianist fits the bill. I recommend it to anyone who would appreciate an excellent historical drama and a story that captures both the best and worst qualities of mankind.
0393320928|5.0|This book is a continuation and addendum of sorts to Mr. Feynman's first biography, \\"Surely you are joking, Mr. Feynman\\".  The two major stories of the book involve Mr. Feynman's enormously influential first wife, Arlene and the second story involves Mr. Feynman's work in the Challenger disaster investigation.  Sprinkled around these two major bookends are other humorous adventures and observations about a trip to Japan, being labeled a sexist pig by feminists, and hotel hunting in Europe to name just a few.<BR> <BR>The Challenger investigation takes up a sizable chunk of the book and is sometimes filled with drier material.  But the compelling event and frustrating insight into government bureaucracy holds some interest to make up for the technical specifications.<br />The first part of the book where his wife Arlene is discussed is so touching and powerful that the reader will be hard pressed not to get teary-eyed.<br />As noted in the review about the first biography, Mr. Feynman was an extremely curious person who explored things out of simple curiosity.  His life's quest was nothing simpler than a desire to understand Nature.  All the while, he tried to have the best time he could.  Hopefully this reader can take away at least a little bit of that.
B0000025GW|4.0|and that is a point made by a friend and dylan fan on a coke binge the year it came out.<br />it regards the cover drawing.<br />the closest feature to the viewer is the workman's arm which eerily (or ween-eerily) resembles a flaccid circumscribed unit!<br />my friend's theory related to bob's having had potency troubles, as he and many a loverman will.<br />and the woman who'll love you through it...<br />G'day!
B00008DDSC|4.0|SECRETARY has three things going for it.<br />Maggie Gyllenhaal.  Maggie Gyllenhaal.  Maggie Gyllenhaal.<br />First, Maggie Gyllenhaal's transformation from mental misfit into S&M master player is the stuff great performances are made of.  While the subject matter might not have won over every viewer, the subtle nuances of her performances, the minor changes in her body language, and the growing fervor in her eyes elevated what could've been a laughable attempt at showing the effects of perverse seduction to the area of pure art.<br />Second, Maggie Gyllenhaal inhabits this character so tightly, so perfectly, so vividly, it's hard to imagine any other person ever being considered for the role.  With an awkward grace, she fumbles uncomfortably through her life until her wayward encounter of being spanked truly awakens that part of herself seeking to be so much more than who she is.<br />Third, Maggie Gyllenhaal is a stunningly beautiful actress who is just wonderful to watch on the silver screen, the ... tube, or anywhere else you can catch it.  As does her character, her looks blossom from innocence to worldliness in the course of two hours in the way few actresses have been able to accomplish in any film.  She's a young Diane Lane in the making.  Look for great things from this talented performer.<br />Overall, the story is a bit forced.  It's relatively convenient (or is it star-crossed?) that the frumpy misfit finds the manipulative and sadistic lawyer (played admirably by James Spader in an ever-admirable 'James Spader' mode), but, in the end, its all academic.  These two characters were meant to be together, and they enjoy every bit of shared screen time they get.
B00008S2VH|5.0|The new Madonna album is brilliant, but it needs a few listens and to skip songs 3 & 5. This is a bit different from my original review which was written too soon. Here's a song by song review:<BR>1 American Life(10): Groovy! Nice melody in the chorus, great rap, smart lyrics. Awesome title track.<BR>2 Hollywood(10): High tempo potential single.<BR>3 I'm So Stupid(6): One of two bad songs that should have been edited out.

I'm so stupid...\\")<BR>4 Love Profusion(10): Another potential high tempo single.<BR>5 Nobody Knows Me(6): Same as 3.<BR>6 Nothing Fails(10): Awesome, beautiful love song.

B00008S2VG|4.0|Loved Ray of Light. And then MUSIC  was released. Critics adored it! and I kept reading how it was such a breakthru - but I guess I missed it.<br />For me - it was good album but only certain songs were \\"great\\", while others were a bit weak. When listening to it - it went \\"up & down\\". I definitely had my fav's.<br />American Life, for me, fulfills what Madonna attempted on MUSIC. It works as an entire album; and definitely needs to be heard as one piece as I think it flows together quite well. I wasn't a fan of Die Another Day as a single release - but when heard in the context of this album - I like it. It works for me.<br />The best song, & as one other reviewer wrote, Nothing Fails is the highlight of this album & continues to move upward from there. The intimacy of  the track \\"Intervention\\" & the danceable beats of \\"Mother & Father\\" all work to make the CD a great collection.<br />And kudo's to Madonna for \\"tweaking\\" her vocals & experimenting with the various \\"sounds\\". As she will admit - she never professes to be a great vocalist - so she can have \\"fun\\" with her vocals & take them to all kind of fun places. True, some are not as good as others...but at least she makes the attempt.

B00005JKPF|4.0|This movie is a great present to all X-fans.<br />As it opens a demonic looking, teleporting mutant launches an outrageous attack on the White House - almost getting to the President before he is stopped and disappears.  Eventually getting a bead on the mutant with Cerebro, Xavier sends Jean Grey and Storm to investigate, while he and Cyclops pay a visit to the incarcerated Magneto and Wolverine looks after the students at the Institute.<br />Certainly things don't go as expected for Jean and Storm, who find the would-be assassin in an abandoned church.  He not only makes no move to attack, but seems genuinely distraught and has no idea why he did what he did - a relief to all X fans because this is, as they've already known at first sight, the unmistakable Kurt Wagner a.k.a. Nightcrawler - a gentle soul who would never intentionally hurt anyone.<br />Things go less well for Logan and the students, who face a retaliation for the assassination attempt, leaving some captured and the few escapees on the run.<br />As the movie goes on we learn the connection between Kurt's initial behavior, Wolverine's amnesia-clouded past, the attack on Xavier's and the fact that the Professor and Cyclops have not called back since they left...<br />The movie is definitely geared towards fans, and I have to admit here that people not familiar with the X-Men's history may be a little lost.  The comic is now over 30 years old with many characters, and alot of emotion and events between them.  It's impossible to do full justice to them all in a movie - it would take a full-fledged limited series to do that.  So you probably won't get the whole effect if, for just one example, you don't know why the people behind you are chuckling when Kurt meets Magneto's cohort Mystique for the first time.  Knowing at least a thumbnail sketch would enhance the experience.<br />For fans, though, it's a feast - with a compelling storyline and characters we've known for years, even decades.  The special effects are great, and you'll clap like a kid as our heroes use their powers to protect and defend both mutant and humankind.  There are also some neat little cameos by some familar, though here unnamed, mutants (the best probably being Colossus).<br />The movie also ends with a strong hint as to the probable subject of X3 that will leave you squirming in glee.<br />Definetely recommended to anyone who has ever read the comic.
B00005JLWN|5.0|I don't know what the other reviews of this movie are talking about when they compare this movie to The Matrix.  They have nothing in common.  I guess since The Matrix WAS the most incredible martial arts film (until EQ came around, heh) people feel the need to compare this film to it.  The problem with this is i never stood up in the matrix and clapped after an action scene.  I was so blown away by the fighting in this movie that my jaw dropped and i was speechless (and those who know me know that me being speechless is a very rare occasion).  Not to mention the distopian society and the whole \\"why are we alive?\\" commentary was very good.  For those of you incapable for appreciating this movie for its simplicity and good message, I have one thing to say to you all: Don't buy this movie, you aren't good enough or smart enough to appreciate it for what the director intended!<br />Synopsis: This is one of those movies that makes you go \\"hmmmmm\\" and has the most incredibly coreographed actions scenes EVER (no exaggeration).  For those of you who can enjoy slower, artsy films, this is definitely for you.
B000089RVX|3.0|This CD has a few good songs that you can also listen to on the Daredevil soundtrack but if your not the type of person that want's to listen to lyrics of pain and sorrow, I would'nt recomend this CD cause most of the songs are of that tragic type.  Over all though Evanescence won't be a total waste of time and money if you decided to buy it.
0440237688|4.0|How would living in a flawless world of sameness feel like? In Jonas's mind it is a perfect place. No pain. No secrets. No war. It is just as if living a dream. Everyone has a role in the community and is placed in training at the age of twelve. Each year prior to twelve, there are ceremonies. For example, at the age of nine, the child receives their first bicycle. Then at age seven and eight, sweaters are given to teach the child how to put it on and eventually how to button it. Every one of these gifts is meant to teach proper life skills for the future.<BR> Well, it is time for Jonas's twelve ceremony. Everyone is excited to see the jobs chosen for each child. As he stands nervously awaiting the announcement of his name, the announcer mysteriously skips his name and moves on to the next. Come to find out, he is chosen for the most difficult and rarest job in the community, to be the next Giver. So, later he begins his training. Jonas works with the Giver and finds out about what the world was like in the past. The Giver tells him that nobody has feelings or emotions, that the only one who can hold the memories and pain of the entire community is Jonas. <BR> By transmitting the memories to Jonas, he experiences life like no other. At first it is true pleasure feeling the warmth of the sun melting over head. Then the brutal bloody scenes of war approached. Jonas starts to see that sameness is not good. His friends don't understand why he acts out against them when playing a game of war. They're curious about what is happening to him and his odd behavior. When it is just too much for the Giver and him to take, they devise a plan. Will Jonas make it out of the sameness community? Or will they track him down and have him punished?<BR> The Giver is probably a science fiction combination futuristic novel. This book has a very good sense of creativity and suspense. The only weakness is the ending. It does not imply much about what is to happen next. Lois Lowry's writingstyle is phenomenal because of the excellent detailing work and all around eagerness. I would recommend this novel to ages 12+ only because of the vocabulary and understanding of it.
B0000844MV|5.0|A great movie.  One of the best World War II movies ever made.  I love it!!!
B00008972S|3.0|WELL, actually three and a half stars for the DVD edition - something seems 'odd' about the color control - expecially the balcony sequences [YES, I DO know that this is a specific 'hilighted' production - somewhat stylized regarding color choices and very avant-garde for 1961 - well, well deserving the critical accolades,] BUT the color control does seem to fluctuate on this edition {like a bad technicolor print - bleeding colors} ALSO the DOLBY 5.1 - Great Thumping effects ...occasionally... but then we slip back to Stereo [is it???]<br />ANYHOW, enough!<br />This is a treasure for the collector, and I did finally see this intact last night - somewhat 42 years later. Performances? Superlative, expecially Rita Moreno as the anguished Anita! This Lady deserves every inch of the 1961 Oscar.<br />NATALIE WOOD? A perfect Maria - that last line \\"Don't you touch him!\\" Now that's something to relive ....... The others? Richard Beymer - heartthrob and great '60 ties talent ~ a tortured, intelligent and sensitive Tony.<br />RUSS TAMBLYN? OK ... so just WHERE is his Award? Watch this performance closely .... NOT only a Dancer, Actor, but a superb, superb acrobat ...so underrated. [Fortunately Mr. Tamblyn is still with us - \\"Twin Peaks\\" Anyone?]<br />A MOVIE experience to treasure, and revisit again and again!
B000002HJR|5.0|Heavy-metal, as a genre of music, is ripe with cliches.  Its very nature is to be larger-than-life, whether it's being the loudest band, the fastest band, the heaviest band, the most shocking band, the band with the most intricate time-signatures, the band with the killer guitar solos, etc.  Generally speaking, it aims to impress its audience with either brute force or with a uniquely emphatic and uncompromising brand of musicianship, aimed at a specific audience of the disenfranchised, outcasts of society, giving them an outlet and a sense of brotherhood that is unique to the metal community.  And while metal often times loses its appeal with age, there's always certain things you can come back to.  For yours truly, that band is Down and the album is N.O.L.A.  That's probably because Down's first album is more than just your standard heavy-metal album full of aggressive guitar playing, screaming, pounding drums and throbbing basslines (which it has in spades).  No, there's more to the album than that, something inexplicability raw, authentic, and for lack of a better term: spiritual.  It could be said that N.O.L.A. has a soul.  Soul is not a word that is typically associated with metal, and we're certainly not talking about Mo-Town soul or Dr. John-type soul (although these boys are from New Orleans).  We're talking about a darker type of soul, a soul drenched in pain, regret, anguish, and desperately seeking atonement.  A soul that could only be born out of the Southern experience of isolation, loneliness, and depression.  All of these themes are delivered convincingly by frontman Phil Anselmo, who rages with a great sense of anger and passion throughout the album, although not in the same vein as his primary band at the time: Pantera.  There's a genuine sense of torment and penance in his singing and lyrics on N.O.L.A., as opposed to Pantera which reeks of macho-ism and power.  Throw in Down's ability to create a haunting and spiritual mood via some of the more mellow/acoustic moments, and you have a very original and compelling heavy-metal album.  Down comes out guns-blazing with the explosive \\"Temptation's Wing's\\" which sounds like the long lost lovechild of Black Sabbath and Pantera, but with a uniquely southern swagger.  That summation is pretty representative of the album as a whole.  Its ferocity and heaviness demands attention, rarely letting up in intensity throughout the album.  However, when it does let up, it often reveals some sublime moments, like the guitar solo on \\"Temptation's Wings\\".  It's raw, sweet, slow, and effectively channels the anguish of the song that deals with drug addiction.  Then the band's raw power comes back in full-force inducing an epic head-banging jam to close out the song.  And that's just the first song.  The next track \\"Lifer\\" is one of the best songs on the album, incredibly gritty, passionate, and of course: heavy.  Pepper Keenan and Kirk Windstein absolutely blaze through this song with their steady, propulsive twin-guitar attack.  It's an epic jam with an all-conquering sound, custom-made for headbanging and mosh-pits, which again is also a good description of the album as a whole.  \\"Pillars of Eternity\\" follows, opening with Jimmy Bower's over-powering drumming, eventually launching into an incredibly swampy death-stomp riff as Phil screams over the punishing and pummeling sound the band creates.  One of the straight-up heaviest tracks on the album, straight-up dirty.  Awesomely powerful.  Up next is \\"Rehab\\" which starts out with a borderline funky opening jam, as Phil channels Eddie Vedder with his gritty and grungy singing style.  Any similarities to grunge are soon forgotten as Phil's blows the door off the hinges as he screams \\"...and I'm DROWNING!!!\\" as the band shreds a deep and slow, menacing metallic groove behind him.  A lot of funky, slam-dancable twists and turns on this track, another classic.  \\"Hail the Leaf\\" follows, in all it's hazy, riff-tastic glory.  An ode to the \\"sweet leaf\\" indeed, with a nice water-bong solo thrown in for good measure.  But this track isn't necessarily glorifying the drug, but rather shining a light on the darker side of being dependent on marijuana.  Another gritty jam.  The intensity continues with \\"Underneath Everything\\" which features a consistently grinding and headbanging-inducing riff that recalls doom-metal with its low-end heaviness.  The intensity of the track becomes almost overwhelming towards the end of the song, as Phil screams his head off while the band shreds away behind him, when suddenly, something happens.   The shock-therapy sound slowly fades out, and in its place is a beautiful, almost haunting acoustic guitar to close out the song.  This is where the soul of the album starts to show its face, creeping in at the end of an incredibly brutal song to offer a sense of relief and calm amidst the barrage of heaviness that proceeded it.  This brief lull in the storm provides the perfect transition to one of the best songs on the album: \\"Eyes of the South\\".  This song absolutely has it all, starting out slow with some fantastic classic-rock inspired, bluesy guitar, slowly building up in intensity until the band fully explodes into an epic mosh-pit inducing stomp riff, ignited by Phil's righteous shout of \\"god-damn!\\".  I get chills just thinking about it.  It's one of the best intros/build-ups to a metal song ever.  After the epic intro, Down gives us a break in the middle of the song with a brief melodic guitar-solo, only to close out the song with one of the best stomp-heavy jam sessions on the album.  The entire song is epic from start to finish, and really takes the album to a new level of riff-tastic glory.  After that monster of a song, Down takes us down (no pun intended) to a deeper, trippier level on the next track \\"Jail\\".  An incredibly mellow, acoustic-based track filled with beautiful melodies, echoic vocals, and light tribal drumming, listening to \\"Jail\\" can be a transcendentexperience.  As relaxing and trippy as the song is, it also has a haunting and meditative quality to it that truly makes it a special piece.  It's beautiful, but it's dark too, somewhat somber in tone, with an undeniable spiritual quality.  One of the most beautifully haunting songs ever made.  Very compelling.  Out of the mist comes the blazing \\"Losing All\\" as Down fully launches the listener back into the metallic frey once again.  A fantastic song from start to finish, \\"Losing All\\" features all the trademarks that add up to a great Down song, namely blazing guitar solos, swampy riffs, intense vocals and lots of rhythm.  Righteous song.  The next track \\"Stone the Crow\\" is probably the most accessible song on the album, and sounds like it would be at home on any quality heavy radio station.  But in this case, that's not a bad thing, as \\"Stone the Crow\\" manages to keep its dignity while still being accessible at the same time.  It's simply a great song, no way around it, and easily one of the best on the album.  Down revisits acoustic territory with the all too-brief \\"Pray for the Locusts\\".  It's a really beautiful and haunting piece that again shows the spiritual and soulful vibe that adds a special quality to the music throughout the album.  After the somewhat underwhelming (compared to the rest of the album) \\"Swan Song\\" the band gears up for the epic closer \\"Bury Me In Smoke\\".  Simply put, one of the best heavy-metal songs of all time.  Its main riff sounds like a slow, steady death-march, as it methodically slays the listener into submission.  The song eventually culminates in perhaps the greatest metal jam of all time to close out the song.  It's gritty, it's slow, it's dirty, and it rocks hard in all it's righteous, hazy-smoke filled headbanger glory.  An epic way to end an epic album.  N.O.L.A. is easily of one the best metal albums of the 90s, but also one of the greatest heavy-metal albums of all-time.  What makes it even better is the fact that is was recorded by 5 friends, with zero pretentions, jamming together with no expectations other than to make a badass metal record they would like to listen to.  In the end, they made something much more than that.  They made an album full of heart, grit, integrity, passion, soul, and spirit, all amounting to my personal favorite heavy-metal album of all time.
B00005JKG7|4.0|\\"The Fog\\" isn't the deepest or most intriguing horror movie I've ever seen.  But it's definitely enjoyable to watch, and this remastered edition is something every horror fan should have in their library.<br />The plot is that, 100 years after their ship was sunk thanks to a conspiracy by the founders of a town, the ghosts of the crew of the sunken ship return in the form of a supernatural fog so they can exact their revenge on the town.  Adrienne Barbeau plays a radio DJ caught in the middle of the fog, with Jamie Lee Curtis as a hitchhiker and her mother, Janet Leigh, as the organizer of the town's centennial celebration.  They all face the wrath of the vengeful spirits.<br />The movie starts off with a bang, with eerie happenings in the town, like car alarms going off and bottles shaking.  But after the initial attack of the fog, the movie slows down considerably, as they spend the next 45 minutes setting up the celebration and the story of the ghosts.  Once the fog rolls in, the action picks right back up all the way until the end.<br />The acting is good in this, as all three of the main actresses convey John Carpenter's style very well.  There are also good supporting actors, like Hal Holbrook as the priest who discovers the truth about the fog.  The special effects are also pretty good for the time period, with the fog actually seeming like it's alive, particularly in one scene where it climbs up a pole and kills the power.  There are a couple of shots where it doesn't look good, but they're brief and you only see the fog from a distance anyway.  The ghosts, while never seen up close except for once, are all shown in shadow with glowing red eyes, which is a very eerie effect that's done well.<br />The real strength of this movie is the tension built throughout.  Carpenter has proven time and time again that he's one of the best at doing that, as proven in \\"The Thing\\" and \\"Halloween\\".  In this one, he builds it up via the opening storyteller scene, a \\"Poltergeist\\" type sequence and the middle part where they talk about what happened a hundred years ago.  Carpenter also does a nice job of surprising you, as the use of shadow is done masterfully here.  There's one scene in particular towards the end where you can just barely make out the outline of one of the ghosts, but you really have to be looking carefully for it to see it.<br />As far as extras, this one has two documentaries, one current and one from when the movie was released, and both are very interesting.  There are also outtakes and deleted scenes, which are very interesting.  <br />Like I said, horror fans should definitely pick this up, particularly fans of John Carpenter.  While I like \\"Prince of Darkness\\" better, this one is very good, especially considering that \\"Prince\\" is so hard to find.
B000063DFQ|5.0|This album to me is Maiden at their peak.The only thing it could possibly could be comparable to in greatness are Somewhere in Time and Seventh Son, but they were more synth-driven albums, so they have different styles which aren't really comparable. Just coming off of their breakthrough Number of The Beast, their classic line-up was playing at their peak. Bruce's voice is great on this album, as he uses many different vocal styles to create interseting song atmosphere's, which is particularlly evident in To Tame A Land. This album has the perfect combination of both fast and<BR> slow songs. Now, I'll rate each song one by one.<br /> Where Eagles Dare- A very fast opener with cool singing, great instrumental part in the middle with awesome machine gun sounds in it. Like a premonition to Aces High. 5/5<br /> Revelations- This album's masterpiece. Slower paceed at first, but then gets fast, and back to slow again. Great lyrics, also sounded great on Live After Death. 5/5<br /> Flight of Icarus- An overrated song. So what if it was a single, that dosen't mean its a great song. Cool beginning, but the chorus isn't that great. 4/5<br /> Die With Your Boots On- Awesome song! Another fast one, with a good chorus and a great opening riff. 5/5<br /> The Trooper- Great song, with an awesome solos. More wonderful singing. 5/5<br /> Still Life- Funny message in the beginning, then goes in to a slow, very melodic section before erupting in to an awesome chorus. 4.5/5<br /> Quest For Fire- I don't really like the singing on this song, but the one thing that never failed Maiden during their Glory Years was the music itself, so that is obviously still evident in this song. 3/5<br /> Sun and Steel- Strangley addictive because of its cool chorus. Love the fast playing on this one. 4/5<br /> To Tame A Land- Great singing, kind of strange but it most definetly works here. The band plays so tight its incredible. For sure a masterpiece. 5/5<br /> I don't think that there is much more tosay. You must buy this album!
B000083E79|4.0|The promo sticker on the front of this CD reads: \\"Includes all of Cher's biggest hits.\\" Ah, if that were only true! Granted, this CD does contain all her #1 hits, but smashes like \\"We All Sleep Alone\\" (#14, 1988), \\"Love and Understanding\\" (#17, 1991),\\"You Better Sit Down Kids\\" (#9, 1967), and \\"The Way Of Love\\" (#7, 1972) have strangely enough been left off in favor of low-charting singles like \\"Strong Enough,\\" \\"Save Up All Your Tears\\" and \\"One By One.\\" The problem is evident: Cher has too many hits for a single-disc collection. She deserves a full 2-CD collection!!!<br />This is especially true since this collection (like the previous hits collection \\"If I Could Turn Back Time\\") teases the listener with Sonny and Cher hits. With a 2-CD set, there would be plenty of room for Top Ten gems like \\"A Cowboy's Work Is Never Done,\\" \\"All I Ever Need Is You\\" and Baby Don't Go.\\"<br />Granted, the sound quality on this CD is phenomenal...and all the recordings showcase Cher at her absolute best...but the fact is this collection is incomplete. Furthermore, a non-hit version of \\"A Different Kind Of Love Song\\" is included, as well as the album version of \\"Heart Of Stone,\\" instead of the vastly superior hit version.<br />Cher has been making hit music for almost 40 years! Let's see a complete hits collection already! I recommend fans to pass on this collection and wait for a complete set of all Cher's wonderful hits!
B000088E6D|5.0|listen to sounds of pure musical heaven thats what this Bubl gives ..... pure, soothing, energetic and beautiful<BR>finally someone has come along who brings new meaning to SMOOTH.<BR>I am so thankful -- and so will you be when you listen.....
B000068G9X|5.0|I don't understand after all these years how can an artist like Danzig be at the same time classic yet, only known to a few people thus making his music belong to the underground stage. <BR>  <BR>  SOUTHERN DARK HARD ROCK is the way I would describe his music and DANZIG I is the album that started it all after Misfits and Samhain. <br />  Great rythm guitars with riffs that stay in your mind from the first time you listen to them.<BR>  Great lead guitars by John that gives lessons of how you can be a great guitarist without playing your ass out (watch new gen Timmo and Yngie) but still making sense. <BR>  Combine Jim Morrison's vocals with that of the King and what do you have??? EVIL ELVIS!!! I love the irony and the despair in Glen's voice. <BR>  Twisted evil lyrics that match with the music. I don't know if the lyrics and the whole picture didn't make him attracted to the larger masses but I am glad that the album is just the way it is.<BR>  If you like hard rock, heavy metal try this album and you won't be dissapointed. Then if you like this one know that the second album LUCIFUGE is even better that the first one with the third and fourth following in close distance. <BR>  I just wish Danzig would read so much comic books and lose time with making Blackacidevi and the mediocre Son of Satan when in the past he has influenced a whole music move.
B00005JKPF|4.0|\\"X2 X-men United\\" was a superb film that was actually better than I expected. The film starts off with a good James Bond stlye opening (an action sequence). Then the film continues rapidly with great action, some suspense and a few laughs. <br />Director Brian Singer was able to out do himself. I'll admit I'm not a really big comic book fan. As well as I don't like that many comic books that make it to the big screen. Such as Spiderman/Daredevil. I just saw X-Men about three days ago and I thought it was pretty interesting but to short. I liked how everything seemed like it came right from the comic books and Tv shows which I remember watching as a child. It seemed like the new comic book series that would replace the Batman saga. The film was dark creepy and extrodinary all in one.<br />Now for X2 X-Men United. This film picked up right where the first one left off. It was nice to see a sequal that actually blended in with it's prequel. The action was better. The story was better. The characters were better, and the whole concept is much bigger. More laughs for action, and for of the X-Men's Jet. The effects were all right. It looks like Brian Singer learned how to make better 3D graphics this time. The film does have it's downers such as how they some-what rush through everything. As well as it would be good to watch the first film before you see the second so that you can remember exactly were Wolverine is in the begining, and what the President is talking about with Senator Kelly. Lucky for me I saw the movie just a few days before, I saw the second one so it really helped. By the way, if there are any soundtrack fans wanting to know if the music is good it's great because this time around it's composed and conducted by John Ottman (Lake Placid). I recommend this film to any body that would like to have a good time at the movies... so enjoy.
B000062Y98|3.0|There where two bands that drove me crazy and made me eager about waiting their new cd. The first was Iced Earth. The other was Blind Guardian. I was dissapointed when i first listened to Night at the Opera. I noticed the slight change that they made to their sound and saw that even though there was a progress it wasn't the kind of progress I wanted to hear.<BR>  <BR>  To begin with, what I didn't like in this album was the fact that the songs are too complicated having a progressive feeling. Even when I gave the album a second change and listened to the songs again and again I still didn't like it as a whole. Besides 3 or 4 songs the rest seem uninspired and become tiring.<BR>  Moreover, the lead guitar seems to be playing without a pause even when the choruses go in something that becomes annoying after a while. The lead guitar that was always a great welcome in a Blind Guardian album seem to be losing its sense and even more importantly seems to be subtracting from the riffs as a whole.<BR>  Too much noise, too much yelling and even the vocals seem to be tiresome. They don't add much in melody and Hansi puts too much credit in second and third vocals making the outcome be not impressive but rather plain and anticipated. <BR>  It's not that it is not a good heavy metal - power album. The band wanted to do something different and experimented but I believe that the result didn't please many people. On the other hand when Iced Earth tried to experiment a bit with their sound, I believe they did a pretty good job ( Horror Show). <BR>  <BR>  AS IT DOES NOT DESCRIBE BLIND GUARDIAN AS A WHOLE I WOULD ONLY RECOMMEND THIS ALBUM TO THE CORE FANS (and even though I am a core fan I didn't like it). I would put this album on the list just above the &quot;Follow the Blind&quot;and bellow &quot;Battalions of Fear&quot;.
B00005JKPF|5.0|The first comic book I ever bought was X-Men #130, way back when I was 12.  I collected every issue as they came out up to about #300, and hunted down and bought issues back to #100.  I was an X-Freak.  Then I went to college and kind of forgot about them.  <br />X2 thrilled me to the core.  Even if it doesn't follow the comic books exactly (shouldn't Iceman be much older than Rogue?  Why doesn't she have Ms. Marvel's powers?  Why isn't Pyro British?) and even if I can't identify some of the younger mutants (I recognized Syren and Kitty Pryde, but who the hell is the kid with the blue tongue?  And who is this Gambit that everyone mentions here?  Was he even in the film?) it was stunning to see the action unfolding on screen.  The opening Nightcrawler attack sequence was amazing.  Magneto's escape sequence was awesome to behold.<br />I do have a few quibbles - Cyclops could have been used more effectively, for example.  He could have even not been in the film and it wouldn't have changed too much.  I wanted to see a lot more of Colossus.  The Wolverine/Deathstrike battle was over far too quick.  Two hours felt too short and rushed.  And would that much extra iron in your blood just kill you or shut down your liver or something?  Ah.. comic book logic.  <br />But the end... my skin was tingling and I got goosebumps (never - NEVER - have I gotten goosebumps at a movie before!) when I it gradually sank in exactly what they were setting up for X3. (HINT - look at the issue number I started my collection at, and add about, oh, seven.)  <br />I have no idea HOW they'll do that in two hours though.  All I know is I can't wait.
B000085RTZ|5.0|The album received some of the best critics and looks incredibly fresh compared to the previous album Karma. The songs are spectacular filled with creativity and originality. Kamelot fans don't have words to describe this album and the rest of the fans would simply love it.
B00005JKPF|5.0|This movie has way more action than the first and a lot better. I just watched a day after it came out! It is cool because there are new x-men like iceman, night crawler,etc. + Jean Grey dies in this movie at the end.
B00005JLMH|3.0|I would be recomend watch this film only if you interested in very good play performed by very experienced team of actors...<BR>End if you like musik of Vangelis who wrote it for this film...<BR>That is a good side of this movie...<BR>Now let's start about bad side of movie...<BR>First: American continent was originaly open by vikings...<BR>Second: Columbus kiled tousends indians for gold...<BR>Third: This movie give peoples wrong historical view what made knowledge of history very poor among school students...<BR>This last one is actually most important issue...<BR>How many times I russian immigrant find out about poor knowledge of own history by peoples in USA...
B000002UAR|5.0|What do the Beatles sing about on this album? Love, hate, depression, loneliness, laziness, joy, happiness, disgust, and finally, transcendence. That any pop album would attempt this is amazing, especially in 1966. That it could be done successfully... well, a miracle. Revolver also has its share of musical experimentation, with the Beatles pushing their imagination to the limit. Paul's bass playing hits its stride here, with some creative and driving counter-melodies. He also takes a huge leap lyrically compared to Rubber Soul; perhaps John's compositions pushed him to improve his own. Elenor Rigby is a truly sad song, and For No One has just the right amount of sadness and self-pity without being repulsive.<br />George has some great songs too, Taxman being a witty opener to the album. Paul's bass playing is really awesome here. Love You To, as everyone says, is the best of George's Indian flavored songs, and the discordance on I Want to Tell You is very daring.<br />John has some great ones, with I'm Only Sleeping capturing a dream-like atmosphere better than any song before it, She Said She Said having the singer actually sound confused and anxious. And then, there's Tomorrow Never Knows...<br />The best album The Beatles ever did.
0553213105|5.0|The plot is intriguing: an assembly of eligible men take short-term residence in a town full of unmarried women. As a result, several couples pair off and a few marry. The novel is concerned primarily with one couple: Eliza and Darcy.<br />Obstacles prevent these two from seeing each other's worth. Darcy at first thinks Eliza possesses no great share of beauty. He is prejudiced and only sees her as a product of her class. But by gazing through the windows to her soul - her dark eyes - he slowly becomes fascinated by this enthralling beauty.<br />Eliza, proud herself, will not accept the advances of a haughty, cold man like Darcy. Instead, she offers her affections to a bright-colored soldier, who possesses pleasing manners to match her own. But experience teaches her that a cool temper can hide love, and pleasing manners can mask cruelty.<br />Appearances are deceiving, and lessons are hard learned in Pride and Prejudice, a light romance, occasionally skirting the depths of human psychology.
B00005JKPF|4.0|I've been a fan of the X-Men since I was around 9 years old. In recent years, the comics have gotten stale and almost impossible to follow (A situation that Marvel Comics has turned around lately), and despite giving the first X-Men film more than one chance, I really didn't think much of it. So I tried to keep my expectations low for X-2...<br />  The good news is- It's MUCH better than it's predecessor! X-2 doesn't need to bombard viewers with as much information (Since that was mostly taken care of in the first film), and can pretty much hit the ground running. We pick up right where the first film left off: Magneto is in jail, Wolverine is looking for clues to his past, and anti-mutant hysteria is running rampant. Enter William Stryker, a fanatical Government employed mutant-hater, excellently played by Brian Cox. He sends blue-skinned mutant Nightcrawler to tear up the White House and rough up the President in the awesome opening sequence, therby ensuring Presidential cooperation with the anti-mutant agenda. Stryker wastes no time at all setting up a covert forces strike team, and their first target is.....Professor Xavier's school. Seems like they picked the wrong time to visit, though; The kids are home alone with their \\"Babysitter\\".....Wolverine! Let's get ready to RUMMMMBBBLLEEEE!!!<br />  Before you know it, it's all-out war between Stryker and the assembled mutant faction; Magneto is sprung from prison, Xavier and Cyclops are captured and used by Stryker, and the stage is set for a winner-take-all brawl at Alkali Lake, where Wolvie just might find out some interesting tidbits about his Adamantium skeleton and claws.....<br />  Fans disappointed by the lack of action in the first film will be in their glory here, as the number of fights have been ratcheted waaayyy up, including an excellent throw-down between Wolverne and Deathstrike, played by the lovely Kelly Hu, and Wolverine's berserker rage in the mansion. Gotta love the way he dispatches Stryker's goons...! Director Bryan Singer has assembled an excellent cast, and each character gets his or her moment to shine. The new additions, Cox and Hu, do a great job with their respective roles, and the end sets the stage for X-3. Longtime fans will appreciate the appearances by X-Men mainstays like The Beast, Colossus, Siryn, Artie, and Kitty Pryde, and be on the lookout for mentions of Gambit and Franklin Richards, among others. <br />  Bad news...? The film starts strong but gets a little draggy towards the end; Maybe some tighter editing was needed. Also, considering how heavily the film relies on characters and situations developed by X-Men comic-book scribe Chris Claremont, including the plot lifted whole-cloth from his legendary graphic novel \\"God Loves, Man Kills\\", I was more than a little dismayed not to see him acknowledged in the credits.<br />  X-2 isn't a perfect film, but it's a BIG step up from the previous X-Men movie, and a great way to start the summer movie-going season.
B00005JKPF|5.0|Building on the vast success of the first X-Men film director Bryan Singer has not only a hit with the second installment, X2, but he's hit it out of the ballpark. The first film was essentially an extended character and story introduction and in those regards it works very well, but here everything is bigger and better from the special effects, outfits, music score, characters, story, etc (and hair styles!). It's just brimming with confidence and it plays out to be my favorite comic-book film ever created.<br />The White House goes under siege. With a \\"bampf\\" we see the teleporting blue-skinned mutant known as Nightcrawler take the president's life to the edge of a knife. Needless to say the strained mutant/human relationship is once again heightened and a mysterious military scientist William Stryker is all over the situation. He's been involved in the mutant issue as long as anybody, his son is a mutant it turns out, and knows about it all, even Xavier's School and Wolverine's history. There is a lot going on throughout, but the multiple threads never seem to get too distanced from each other and they all lead back to one man, Stryker, who now has kidnapped Professor Xavier and is well prepared to exploit his powers.<br />The real strength of the film is in the actors. Even with the film featuring a dozen or so central characters there doesn't seem to be too much lack as far as building them and giving them something to do. The only real victim would probably be Cyclops, which is shame as he's one of the central leaders of the team. Ian McKellen plays Magneto with such a driven, menacing edge he's a thrill to watch. His escape from his plastic cell displays what true presence and awe the man can evoke. For the most part the returning characters are that much better with Halle Berry's Storm given her due leadership role, Patrick Stewar's Professor Xavier showing us why he's held in high regard, and especially Famke Janssen's Jean Grey who delivers the film's emotional climax quite grandly. The real surprise for me was the Mystique character, which here is brought much more to the front and for good reason as she's both the ideal eye-candy and morphing deadly assassin all in one. Allan Cumming too impressed me as Nightcrawler, who unlike the other mutants relies on his religious faith to guide him, not anger or hope. Of course, the real star is still Hugh Jackman's Wolverine who possesses such a animalistic power and presence, you'd swear he sweats testosterone. That's not to say he can't do the slower scenes (Wolverine and Jean Grey's time together especially are well done), but he's such a knockout in the action ones.<br />Like I mentioned before, the big difference here is confidence and every inch of the film is brimming with it from the director to the cast to the story. Singer was able to get the budge this film deserved based off the first film's success and he and 20th Century Fox have used that to their benefit. The film appears to be made first for the comic fan, which is how it should be (there's a final hint at the end as to where X3 will be taking us). There's many quick shots and references to mutants that have yet to make an appearence in the film series. This film never insults the viewer, it's constantly raising the bar for the audience to keep up with. My favorite part is that they never sink down to make it more general audience friendly, they challenge you to become part of their world and it succeeds. It's the comic film for the grown-up, the thinking man's hero adventure.onal climax quite grandly.

B000002UD7|5.0|When the Pet Shop Boys were working on the second album their original working title was JEALOUSY but then they changed to the<br />strangely adverbal \\"actually\\". Such a subtle title for a brilliant album.<br />\\"One More Chance\\" was one of the first songs Chris and Neil ever wrote. It was one of their first singles too. But here it gets a high production rework with sound effects of screaching cars and city sounds. Brilliant hi-NRG!<br />\\"What Have I Done to Deserve This\\" a mouthful of a title that sounds like a Smiths song! But indeed it is PSB with Dusty Springfield on this top 10 hit where Neil and Dusty's voices melt beautifully!<br />\\"Shopping\\" is a statement on buying and selling, on society and influence. \\"We're buying and selling your history...we're shopping\\".<br />\\"Rent\\" seems so simple at first. The confessions of a kept perosn in a relationship where love is calculated by money and presents. So wonderful Neil really delivers a wonderful vocal on this with the line \\"i love you, you pay my rent\\". But further sinsister is Neil chanting at the end the refraim from a Buddy Holly classic \\"it's easy it's so easy...\\" The effect is haunting and beautiful.<br />\\"Hit Music\\" brings you back to the dancefloor with the sounds of late 70s eurodisco. So roll up the rug and play this tune and turn your bedroom into discoland.<br />\\"It Couldn't Happen Here\\" was also the title of the movie the PSBoys made. Everyone sees horrors happening in other places and say it couldn't happen here. Moody and atmospheric this song, a very underated song!<br />\\"It's a Sin\\" was an over the top video with the seven deadly sins personified with Neil getting excommunicated! He sings about how growing up in the church he was taught that sin was unescapable. \\"everywhere I'm going to...it's a sin!\\".<br />\\"I Want to Wake Up\\" is a personal fave of mine! Just because of the line \\"i stood at the kitchen sink radio playing, songs like 'Tainted Love' and 'Love is Strange'\\"!<br />\\"Heart\\" uses a special vocal sampling of vowel sounds mixed and arranged into a rhythm pattern which creates the back beat of this number 1 single in the UK!<br />\\"King's Cross\\" brings us feelings of loss and regret. Unusal way to end an album on a down note but the PSBoys knew what they were doing as this song will stay with you long after hearing.<br />So have a Heart! It's a Sin not to give this CD One More Chance!<br />For extra credit look into the limited double CD version with the mixes and bsides added. Either way this album is perfect, actually!l vocal sampling of vowel sounds mixed and arranged into a rhythm pattern which creates the back beat of this number 1 single in the UK! <br />\\"King's Cross\\" brings us feelings of loss and regret.

0783228457|5.0|Do not see this film if you tend to gravitate towards cliched, shallow, &quot;dumb&quot; movies.  David Cronenberg had set a standard for creativity and will continue to spark inspiration for future filmmakers, years to come.
0688163173|5.0|Shutter Island is the kind of book that hooks you on the first page and doesn't let you go until the last page.<br />It starts out with to U.S. Marshalls going to a mental instituition to locate a patient that escaped.  The mental instituition is on and isolated island, and there is a hurricane headed toward the island.  Once on the island it is revealed that one of the cops has an ulterior motive for wanting the assignment.  As the story progresses he begins to think that someone is trying to drive him insane.<br />The book does have the same plot hook of several recent movies, I had a feeling I knew where it was heading after about 150 pages, but Lehane's writing style keeps it fresh and interesting.<br />I'm a big fan of Dennis Lehane.  He never fails to write great thrillers, although Shutter Island and his last book Mystic River are great books, I hope he hasn't retired the Patrick Kenzie/Angie Gennaro series.  Those characters are still my favorites.
B00000K19E|5.0|I'm sick of hearing people say, &quot;Great action and it has a decent story, too.&quot; Movies are unwatchable a second time without a story. I've seen this one probably about 15 times. The reason is the story. It's fantastic. The visuals only make the story believable and they do it well. A movie like the Matrix does not get people saying, &quot;I'd explain it if I could, but to understand it, you have to see it for yourself,&quot; without an incredible and, absurdly, plausible story.<BR>My only beef: The lobby scene is unnessessary!! I hope the sequels don't do that.
B00008H2LB|5.0|First of all let me say that my expectations for this this CD were low (coming of the horrible Reanimation). And also Hybrid Theory being one of the best rock albums of the last 5 years gave it alot to live up to. But... They came back with some heavy new songs (Don't Stay, Lying From You,Hit the floor) And also some surprisingly good soft songs (easier to run, breaking the habit.) tHAT'S WHY, IN SHORT, I GIVE THIS 5 STARS

0446310786|5.0|To Kill A Mockingbird was a remarkable read, with little quips and funny stories to bind the book, along with the powerful telling of injustice and prejudice in our nation. Set in the quiet town of Maycomb, Alabama in the 1930's-- the aftermath of the civil war, and the incipient prelude to the second World War-- we are narrated by Scout, a quick and innocent girl growing up in the deep south. <BR>   We see that Scout's father tries to bring Scout up with a pure understanding of the nation, and to veer her away from the awful discrimination that is shown, but she simply cannot turn her face from the terrible hate and bitterness that is slowly bubbling in Maycomb. All these complex feelings are brought to a climax when a black man is accused of raping a young white girl. Scout's father must defend the man, and in doing so, endangers his own children. <BR>   In order to truly understand, a reader must put him/herself in the shoes of Maycomb County's residents, and walk the painful steps of racial prejudice. You will find that the walk is almost unendurable; you'll question how this came to be, and what the consequences were. A delighting, yet sorrowful read, I'd recommend this to a serious reader, who is willing to learn of the past.
B00000AF98|4.0|This is definitely a stronger album than Asylum and Hot In The Shade and is the best of the Stanley, Simmons, Kulick, Carr lineup. The only other Kulick studio album worth having in its entirety is Revenge. That being said, this is definitely pop metal and does have a couple throwaway tracks (Bang Bang You being one of them). For a lot of people this sound is a turnoff compared to the &quot;classic&quot; KISS, but if you compare it with the other non-makeup albums from the 80's this band released, it holds together better than the rest. Gene finally has some songs that are worth listening to here (Thief In The Night and Good Girl Gone Bad for example). Paul definitely steals the show, though, with the title track, I'll Fight Hell To Hold You, My Way, Reason To Live, and Turn On The Night. Most of the best songs from the other 80's albums can be found on numerous compilations or the box set, but this disc is not represented well enough anywhere else so you should start with this one to cover the missing bases.
037542217X|5.0|Mma Ramotswe is back in form in the fourth book in the series about the No. 1 Ladies' Detective agency.  Her detective agency is on solid footing although she's barely breaking even financially; she's become in institution in the community, her faithful fiance Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni is still faithful (are these two ever going to set the date??) and overall, life is good.  But there's a small cloud on the horizon; a pushy male detective who claims to be from the Big Apple sets up shop in town, loudly proclaiming that sleuthing is a man's business after all, and threatens to give Mma Ramotswe some serious competition.  But Mma. Makutsi, her trusty assistant, saves the day by scavenging some old typewriters and opening an adjunct business in their office, a typing school for men (what's the difference between a clerk and a secretary, except that men are called clerks and women are called secretaries, Mma. Makutsi reasons; after all, they both need to know how to type).  And next thing you know, business is booming, and one of Mma. Makutsi's students is making some serious moves on her.  Is love in the air?  Or is this guy maybe too good to be true?  It's up to Mma Ramotswe to find out, when she has time off from her search for two missing persons, and dealing with that pesky competition on the side.<br />Alexander McCall Smith brings Mma Ramotswe back onstage with all her formidable qualities very much in effect; her shrewd mother-wit, her common sense, and her uncanny intuition.  Like the first three book, \\"The Kalahari Typing School for Men\\" is an enchanting love poem to the people and the continent that so intrigues and fascinates Smith, and which he makes so fascinating for the rest of us.  It's all summed up in his coda on the final page:<br />  africa<br />  africa africa<br />  africa africa africa<br />  africa africa<br />  africa
B00006GFAB|3.0|The music here gets 5 stars, but the compilation itself gets one star because as others have stated, it is totally unnecessary. I have not and probably won't buy this. Double Platinum, Smashes, Thrashes, &amp; Hits, the Alive albums, and the Box Set make this collection obsolete before it even came into existance. As a previous reviewer suggested, we could use a compilation of 80's/90's only material. I'll go one further and suggest a collection of non-makeup songs that haven't been covered appropriately in other compilations or the box set. &quot;Uncovered&quot; would make a great title in multiple senses of the word and here is a suggestion for a track listing:<br />1.A Million To One [from Lick It Up]<BR>2.I've Had Enough (Into The Fire) [from Animalize]<BR>3.Under The Gun [from Animalize]<BR>4.King Of The Mountain [from Asylum]<BR>5.Who Wants To Be Lonely [from Asylum]<BR>6.I'll Fight Hell To Hold You [from Crazy Nights]<BR>7.My Way [from Crazy Nights]<BR>8.Good Girl Gone Bad [from Crazy Nights]<br />9.Turn On The Night [from Crazy Nights]<BR>10.Thief In The Night [from Crazy Nights]<BR>11.Rise To It [from Hot In The Shade]<BR>12.Somewhere Between Heaven &amp; Hell [from Hot In The Shade]<BR>13.Take It Off [from Revenge]<BR>14.I Just Wanna [from Revenge]<BR>15.Carr Jamm 1981 [from Revenge]<BR>16.Jungle [from Carnival Of Souls]<br />Yes there is a lot more Paul material here than Gene's, but during the 80's studio albums it was Paul's material that kept the band alive. Of course if this set existed, it would be pretty much unnecessary to buy any of the non-makeup studio albums since all the best material would then be available on compilations and the record company couldn't have that. Then again, it would give them another selling angle to work their catalog and milk as much out of it as they can. Heads up fans...As if there aren't enough compilations already available, there is an &quot;Anthology&quot; rumoured to be released sometime this year. Time remains tosee what selection of songs will end up on that set...
B00006F7S4|5.0|After already giving this album the thumbs up righ tafter it came out, I put it aside for a while to delve into som eother new releases. Then, a few months ago, I started listening to it heavily again, and now I can not stop. I am reviewing this again so that I might mention a few things I was not able to in my first premature writeup. &quot;Sea Change&quot; is by far Beck's finest album, hands down. There is no gimmickery here, no abstract hip-hop rhythms or Bollywood influences. This is not to say that Beck's previous releases were not exceptional. Each, from &quot;Mellow Gold&quot; to &quot;Midnite Vultures&quot; is brilliant in its own right. Yet, there was never much of a centralized theme to any of his previous work. It's safe to say that Beck's music can not be classified into one category, and that is what makes it interesting. However, there was too much happening in &quot;Midnite Vultures&quot; and &quot;Odelay&quot; to truly consider them masterpieces. &quot;Sea Change&quot;, however, flows like one fifty-two minute track. The songs are more withdrawn, and yetdefinitely more cohesive than any Beck album. &quot;Sea Change&quot; is actual songwriting, whereas his others (with the exception of &quot;Mutations&quot;, I suppose) only hint at what he was capable of. Loneliness seems to be the theme, but not a dark or depressing loneliness; Beck has captured the sound of sitting at home and dwelling. It's quite soothing, and at times even bright (&quot;End of the Day&quot;, &quot;Lost Cause&quot;). If Beck stopped making music tomorrow, this would be the album he'd be remembered for; in my book it's already reached classic status.
B00005JKPF|4.0|Usually it seems like sequels are not good compared to the first. I think this movie isn't as great as X-Men 1, but very well done.<br />The plot seems to run dry. Some guy wants to kill all mutants using cerebro, which was that machine they used to find mutants. It is completely different from X1, but that isn't why the movie is good. It is because of the action, and the characters. If you don't love the characters, you won't love the movie. My dad said the reason he didn't like starwars 2 was because of Anakin, and he is right(noone wants to listen to a whiner). All the characters in this movie you can like, Storm can be stupid at times though. I don't want to give it away, but when Jean states \\"Its targeting something else\\", Storms reply is \\"If its not targeting blahblah then what is it targeting?\\". Dude, Storm, every single person in that room understands what Jean is talking about, you are just making yourself look stupid. The action is great also. At first you think Wolverine is gonna do that thing where instead of killing people he slashes their guns in half, your wrong. He actually stabs people, for real. There isn't any blood, but its awesome. I mean he must stab 100 people. It is very cool. Storm does some stuff. Even though shes got a pretty big picture on the cover, she is not a main character at all. They have introduced some more mutants too, and it basically highlights the new recruits. Night crawler is major with his transport skill, and Colossus throws these 2 guys. Then there is Pyro. Pyro states that he is the worst mutant of them all, yet he can't even create fire, and you will see what I mean by that. One thing you may notice is that they have changed Pyro, in X1 he was the guy who made the small flame, and iceman froze it. He had blonde hair and looked alot different, they got a new guy to do him in this movie. The humor is alright, and Wolverine does most of it, but some of the people in the theatre would just not stop laughing. I mean jeez, I had to ask someone to stop talking, just because they were laughing at the most stupid things. It can be funny though if you are watching it with just your family, and don't have to sit next to people who like to make sarcastic remarks to themselves when nobody cares(you know who im talking about, that person who always does the \\"ooowwwwwww, that must of hurt\\" when it was obvious that it hurt.). So even though my theatre expeirience was bad, I enjoyed the movie, and if you like alot of action with a few boring scenes, you will like this movie.had to ask someone to stop talking, just because they were laughing at the most stupid things.

B00005JLSE|5.0|Chicago was one of the years best pictures , The cast were all excellent and the whole film was just superb. It was film making done with love and care and you could see the cast gave it there all. Truly one of the best musicals ever made.
B00008GKEG|5.0|The live 1965 concert footage is worth the price of admission alone.<br />I was 14 in '65 and nothing beats being a teenage girl and experiencing Beatlemania at the same time.  Oh, yeah.  Intense, you  had to be there.  I would have killed for a ticket to one of their concerts.  Now I'm glad I didn't, wouldn't have heard a thing.  (Although at the time I don't think I would have cared).  You can hear it now on DVD.  Visuals are excellent as well.  Good job, well done.
0767802470|5.0|Das Boot is a great movie, one that no movie buff should miss!  But even if you've seen it before, it's worth looking at again on DVD, for the excellent director's cut and restoration, as well as the commentary.  The picture and sound are perfect, and unlike many foreign films, the dubbed version retains the excellent surround sound and authenticity.  (Many of the original actors did the dubbing, which is perhaps why it sounds so authentic.)  I don't normally like dubbed movies, but in this case, you can follow the action without losing the subtleties of the actor's performance (or, of course, watch it in the original German with or without subtitles, they're all included).  There is only a very short documentary included, but the commentary is excellent as well - many commentaries are dull, endless refrains of &quot;this was great, that was great&quot; but this commentary really goes into the details of how the film was made, and it never drags even after 3 hours.  The double sided DVD is a little annoying (I'd rather just have two discs) but the transition is seamless and it probably keeps the cost down.<br />Movie buffs probably saw Das Boot when it came out back in 1982, but it's worth seeing again in this DVD version, the longer director's cut really adds a lot to the experience (it doesn't feel padded at all), the enhanced picture and sound make it even more exciting than the original, and this is one of the best commentaries I've ever heard.
B00006G8G1|5.0|If you like Iron Maiden, this about as good as it gets!  The performances are great, the instruments are huge and energetic without losing clarity, and Bruce's singing is dead on the whole night.  You can just see and feel how excited they are to be playing this show.  This surely redeems the last 3 live albums they've done, which were recorded near the end of Bruce's first run with the band, and to ME sounded a little garbled and hasty.  There's just some magic to the way some recordings come together, and this is one has it!  This leaves all 4 of their live albums I've heard in the dust, (yes...even Live After Death!)  I say this is the one to get.
0316666343|1.0|I read the reviews on this book expecting something really great. I was sorely disappointed. The idea is clever but it just doesn't work.  I'm sure that someone will try to make a movie ot of the novel. Good luck!  This is one that I really cant' recommend.
B00008H2LB|5.0|being a fan of hard rock and never really liking rap i can not believe how good this disk is. rap metal has always been a total turn off for me but these guys are different.great inventive songs ,greatlyrics and cool guitar playing are all over this.from the first listen i was hooked .the melodies are great and from start to finish this is a great cd .get it now !! you will not be disapointed.
B00008H2LB|2.0|Let's get one thing straight - the only reason I bought into Linkin Park's albums is because Stabbing Westward broke up. After SW was gone, there was nothing left in the electronic-rock genre for me to listen to, so I've had to resort to this.<br />Mike and Chester's lyrics have nowhere near the depth that they claim. All they talk about is pain and more pain, but they never make you feel it or bring you into their world. Their &quot;pain&quot; is an abstraction. They never describe it. Are you mad at someone? Tell us what they did. DESCRIBE IT. <br />After I've heard SW's &quot;Waking up beside you&quot;, &quot;On your Way Down&quot;, or &quot;So Far Away&quot;, lyrics like &quot;I wanna heal. I wanna feel.&quot; just don't do it for me. They're built to hook, not to express. Their feeling is empty.<br />About the only real feeling in the whole of Meteora is found in &quot;Numb&quot; and &quot;Breaking the Habit&quot;. The former describes a parent's disappointed expectations for their child, and the latter talks about, well, anger management. <br />Musically, the album bores me. Many of the songs have a very promising beginning, but then it sinks into the same heavy progression. Except for a couple, almost all the songs and their lyrics could easily be interchanged. There's no excuse for this. Thousands of bands have nothing but guitar bass and drums to use, and have created distinct sounds and songs. Therefore, LP has no excuse, since they have an arsenal of computers, Pro Tools gear, samplers, synths, and more that should be used more effectively. <br />I know bands have to have a &quot;sound&quot;, but every song should not sound the same! Experimentation is a good thing. One of the coolest tracks on Meteora, &quot;Nobody's Listening&quot;, has a great rhythm and melody and sounds completely different from everything else on the album. <br />About the only reason I'll keep this CD is the Enhanced content. It's packed full of cool stuff (I'm a multimedia artist,BTW). What LP lacks in musical ability they more than make up for in hype, branding, and presentation. No one does it better. The 2 stars are for a couple of songs and this Enhanced content.<br />Too bad the music doesn't live up to the hype.
B00008NRI8|4.0|I am a big fan of romantic comedies, but nowadays, its more romance than comedy. I wish they made more movies like Pretty Woman and Runaway Bride. I'm not saying \\"Two Weeks Notice\\" is terrible, I just wish there was more funny for my money. Sandra Bullock and Hugh Grant make a good movie couple but they are both known for having laugh filled movies. Sandra was hilarious in \\"Miss Congeniality\\" and Hugh was good in both \\"About a Boy\\" and \\"Bridget Jones' Diary\\". If you are looking for a romantic comedy for the entire family then I suggest you get this movie, because there was no sexual situations and most of the sexual humor will fly over the kids heads and there is like one or two mild bad words (I heard only one but it was only \\"hell\\" and there is no other language from what I heard). Anyway, check this comedy out because its likeable but lacks laugh-out-loud humor.
B00005JLR2|5.0|I toatally adore this movie. It is the best animated Disney movie (not including Lilo and Stich) since the Lion King. Disey did a great job here. The animation is amazing. The cahracters are well designed and there is plenty of comedy and adventure, but for romance junkies, here is a warning, there is only a tad of romance between Dr. Doppler and Captain Amelia. This is definatly a DVD you should have in your collection.

0684833395|4.0|A person's enjoyment of &quot;Catch 22&quot; might depend on their current views of the war. Regardless of what those feelings may be, they will most likely be strengthened after reading this book. It is sometimes considered an anti-war book, but anyone who disagrees with that would probably consider it honest and comical. The main character Yossarian is not fond of war. He learns early on that the real &quot;catch&quot; is that a man is considered insane if he willingly continues to participate in the missions, not if he requests to leave. Anyone who is smart enough to request to go home proves their sanity. Yossarian spends the entire novel trying to think of ways to be relieved of his duties. He just barely escapes a couple of opportunities to be sent home, which only adds to the several elements of humor, satire and irony. <BR>I read &quot;Catch 22&quot; for a high school assignment, expecting it to be another serious and dramatic book similar to the majority of the works I have read throughout high school. It is basically the opposite. I wish it had be required reading because it introduces elements of humor and irony that many students have not been introduced to in works of literary merit. It evokes many questions, sometimes deep and philosophical, sometimes trivial, of the true meanings of life and war. I would've loved to have many class discussions about this book because each student would have different views and opinions to share.<BR>While I don't consider it the best book ever, it certainly is enjoyable. Although elements of war really don't interest me, probably due to current events, I was entertained by the humor, irony and sarcasm, which helped to make many of the character, especially Yossarian, extremely relatable.
B00006JJ2Y|4.0|Every two or three years I go back and listen to my collection of Lou Reed albums repeatedly for a month or two. During such stints, I seldom listen to anything else. After his latest release (The Raven) I decided to revisit his substantial catalog in order to, for my own sake, place his current work in a broader artistic context. There has always been a tremendous thematic continuity in his work that I appreciate. <br />After listening to his recent releases and then to \\"Take No Prisoners,\\" I was pretty shocked (in a good way, mind you) by how completely different Lou Reed was back in the late `70s. Bold, brash, arrogant, desperate-Lou Reed was all these traits in addition to being one of the greatest singer/songwriter/performers of the `70s. \\"Take No Prisoners\\" is an incredible album that features a version of Lou Reed that is just as edgy and abrasive as the crowd to which he plays. The band is tight, but often they are not given much of a chance to develop the tracks into coherent musical constructions, due to Reed's extensive monologues, which are occasionally compelling, sometimes banal, but often hilarious. When the band does find the room to break into the choruses of the songs, they charge into them with the strength and force of a runaway locomotive.  This was a great band recorded on a very special night. The energy in the music is astounding.<br />Although the discs boast several classic Reed tracks that are all performed in a style that is somewhere between the Lou Reed we are normally used to hearing and something from the comedic repertoire of Lenny Bruce, for me the standout tracks are the versions of \\"Coney Island Baby\\" and the epic \\"Street Hassle\\" on Disc 2. Reed's singing on these tracks is stellar-he passionately captures the speech mannerisms of the downtrodden, the hustlers, and of the humanly expendable in these songs. He so convincingly becomes the characters in these songs that you feel as though you are down in the gutter with him, lookingfor that crumb of salvation that someone may have left behind. <br />The only issue I have with this recording is the poor remastering that was done for the CD release. An original LP vinyl copy will sound much better than this CD, which contains far too much tape hiss to be a genuine remaster. The poor sound quality of the CD prevents me from giving this a 5 star review. <br />If you have any deep interest in Lou Reed, buy \\"Take No Prisoners.\\" Listening to this CD is like going to the circus, but not being able to enjoy it fully because all the clowns are just a little too dirty. It is like going to the zoo, only to walk by the Polar Bear exhibit to see that the animals have eaten the zookeepers. \\"Take No Prisoners\\" very well may be flawed in many people's eyes due to Reed's long orations, but it also brilliantly captures the punk aesthetic and a classic Lou Reed persona that we shall neither see nor hear ever again. This is essential equipment for living in a world that is clearly one big \\"Dirty Blvd.\\"
B00005JLEU|4.0|The movie is a funny as any Disney movie. The characters are as interesting as those of Lewis Carol ( my favorite are the frog in the Kimono and the little mouse) The colors are beautiful and crisp and the background art is so realistic.  Great movie.
0140277447|1.0|If this book was written based on the \\"accounts of survivors\\" than that would explain the lies presented in this book. Since when does a communist tell the truth? This book is riddled with lies (and doctored photos) or at best, gross inaccuracies. If there is even one lie, why should we believe any of it? There were independant international journalists present during that time. Why didnt any of them report this alleged atrocity? Imperial Japan had only one division in Nanjing - 5000 soldiers armed with swords and lousy bolt-action rifles. If they really wanted to kill alot of Chinese, why didnt they take their machine guns there? Most of the residents of Nanking (population est. at 150,000) fled the city before the Japs arrived. To say few thousand Chinese were killed in Nanking is believable. Freedom of speech is a right in America, but not slander.
B00008S2VG|5.0|I am shocked at the variance in responses to this album.....I like it alot and think with every album she only gets better and better. I will admit that some of the lyrics are a little cheesey and take a while to get used to but I think this album is much better that Ray Of Light and more coherant than Music. Some songs took a while to grow on me but now I am addicted to this album....It's weird that some people like certain songs and not others...I think &quot;I'm so Stupid&quot; is one of the best songs of her career.....I love that and Love Profusion and Nobody Knows me. This album is fresh and original and I can overlook the cheesy lyrics in some songs and enjoy it for what it is ...well crafted pop songs...I can't wait to see what videos she come up with to go with the songs....I think the fact that the American Life controversy may have given people a bad impression of the album....But it is fantastic and fun. Hollywood is a great 2nd single...I can't wait.
B00006RCNW|5.0|Without a doubt this is the best show on television.  I felt like I was watching a blockbuster movie rather then a basic cable television show.  Everything about The Shield is excellent from the Michael Chiklis potrayal of good guy, bad cop Vic Mackey to the top notch camera work and script.  This show will have you guessing from one moment to the next and have you glued to the set for the next ten hours.
B00005JL2O|2.0|Wow, talk about recycled jokes!<br />Okay, there's maybe 2 really funny scenes in the whole movie. Those being the only jokes that weren't regurgitated from \\"The Spy Who Shagged Me\\". Then after that, there's a few chuckles here and there. But nothing really balls-to-the-wall funny. The problem with Goldmember is it thinks it's hysterical, when in actuality the jokes are tired, beyond childish (even by typical Austin Powers standards) and just flat-out embarrassing. The fact that it's the third film in the series doesn't excuse it's lack of creativity. This thing is preposterously bad. A one trick pony, all the way. Just another addition to Comatose Comedy. There's been a rash of them lately.
B000002P72|5.0|This record --- and BB King --- doesn't need me to enhance any reputation. Obviously this is one of the greatest blues reocrdings ever made. But I want to call attention to what I consider to be the single greatest blues riff ever played, or that ever WILL be played.<br />On this record, listen to the opening instrumental solo in &quot;How Blue Can You Get&quot; -- it goes on for a few minutes.<br />There is BB playing his heart-and-soul-swirling lead riffs; then a question and answer with sax run; followed by the play out and finally, his opening voice line ... Just get a load of the audience cheering as he finishes the lead sequence, and their utter rejoicing when he wrenches out his opening line.<br />Listen, and I think you'll agree, this just simply closes the door on ANYONE ever transcending a blues riff of such magnitude. It more profound an expression of &quot;soul&quot; than anything I have heard in 50 years of playing and listening to blues, as close to &quot;getting religion&quot; as one is going to get from any music. <br />I actually heard him do this song live (not at the Regal, but in Chicago) back in 1968. It still moves me every single time I heard it.
B00005JKPF|5.0|It is not very often that the sequel surpasses the first.  However on rare occasions it does happen (Terminator 2 and Aliens).  X2 is one of those extremely rare times in movie history.<br />The story behind X2 starts off with Wolverine returning to the mansion shortly after an assination attempt is made towards the president.  The would be assassin is new mutant Nightcrawler.  From that point WIlliam Stryker (Brian Cox) convinces the President to allow him to send a strike team to the X-men Mansion.  As it turns out Wolverine is babysitting that night.  After a kick ... battle sequence (where we see such mutants as Siren, Kitty, and Collosus, and Iceman go into action) every one in the school eventually escapes.  What is not realized is that stryker has captured Cyclops and Proffesor X (Patrick Stewart) and is going to use him (PRofessor X)to destroy all mutants on the planet.  The X-Men must then team up with Mystique and MAgnetto to stop him.  Stryker however has back up as he has Cyclops under a deep mind control sedative and has a deadly assasin, Lady Deathstrike, by his side.  In the end there is a lot of action and deep emotion as the story has the underline telling of civil rights and equality while packing magnificent special effects and incredible action.<br />Everyone who was in the first (outside of Sabertooth and Toad) has returned for the sequel.  The stor is very well done and the action is non stop.  In the end it left implications for a third movie with hints of the Phoenix saga as well as the Sentinals.  This has by far surpassed the first and I am sure many fans will agree.  My only complaint is that the character of Cyclops is still under utilized.  He is still a supproting character and not the leader as he is in the comics.  However he is more 3 dimensional this time with some emotion to him.  In the third film (if it is made) there will probably much more with him in the story than before.  This is a must see movie and when the DVD hits, you can bet I will own this movie.an bet I will own this movie.
B00005JKPF|5.0|This movie was awesome!  I generally hate popcorn movies, but this just ruled.  Way better than the first.  Although there was still no Gambit (arggghhhh), I still loved this movie.  I unsterstand there was no real place for Remy, so Mr. Singer better write him into the third movie.
B00005JKWJ|1.0|This movie was terrible! I was so exicted when I heard they were making a sequel because Blade was such a good movie, and then they come out with this mess. With a rather dreary plot, the movie projects much more gore on the audience than necessary, and the movie lacks depth. Wesley Snipes is always good, but even he can't make up for the rest of this movie. If you're choosing between this movie and something, anything else, go with the something else.
B00003CXUM|5.0|In The Mood For Love is one of the most beautiful and unique films I have ever seen. <br />Sometimes, its not about how much story you deliver, but HOW you deliver it. Sadly, this is often neglected in today's mainstream movies, where quality and meticulouss details are often substituted with non-stop \\"raw\\" and un-refined stimulation.<br />This movie however is simply a beauty!
6305428425|4.0|This movie was so funny, after I saw it, I knew I had to own it. It's good whether you're a girl or a guy, and if you like 80s music, it has an awesome soundtrack. It really shines light on the underdog in high schoool, and the best part is when Mira Sorvino tells off the nasty girl that she hates so much.
B00008S2VG|3.0|I'm giving it 3 stars just because I'm a huge fan, but this album with the exception of \\"Love Profusion\\" really [was bad]. I miss fun Madonna.
0520068211|5.0|I can't belive it. I recently played a video gamecalled \\"Dynasty Warriors 4\\" and its a heck of a lot of fun. But the story line of it was so rich and interesting and everytime I played i thought \\"wow, whoever designed this game has an amzing mind/imagination\\" at the end it said \\"this tale has come to be told ROMANCE OF THE THREE KINDOMS\\" and since all the levels had accual dates in every level a thought came into my mind and i immediatly rushed to my computer and went to amazon and bang, here it is. The tactics of Zhugai Liang, the tiger Sun Jian, Cao Cao, Lu Bu, Dong Zouo, it was all here. I thought to myself, a REAL story. By what I've read so far, the game has to kind of bend the story so whoever you are, you win if you beat all the levels (ex. Shu dynasty conquering all of China at the end) but i cant wait to find out what really happened.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|Ok,when I first heard of this movie, I thought it sounded kind of dumb, but I had to take a film class and this was one of the films we watched...and I love it! It took that class and a group dicussion to fully understand this film and see how deep it really is. I agree with some of the less positive reviewers that you'll either love it or hate, but it's worth watching to find out. Every time I watch this movie I see a few more hints and clues that make it more and more clear. (To those who have seen the movie...remeber \\"CellarDoor\\" and when the class watches the self help video, look where Pat Swayze touches the boy after he hugs him...) Oh, and to some of the other people that wrote reviews, said they \\"get it\\",(I don't think you do) and said that Donnie's home life was ok. (check out his parents' reaction both times after the crash (how concerned are they?) and what they say when the meet Donnie's Therapist for the 1st time.   Ok, I'll shut up now..... No, WATCH THIS MOVIE!!!!
B00007GZR5|5.0|This is one of the most passionate, romantic and powerful movies I've ever seen. It's about soul-mates and how two people transcend time, space, heaven, and hell for love and their desire to be with each other. The visual and special effects of this movie are really incredible. You have to be a bit of a hopeless romantic to enjoy this movie though.
0345457684|4.0|It was strange, although I liked a lot of the ideas, and the details. They are fairly realistic. I think that Morgan, the author, has had a few psychology classes, it's a very human book. A lot of futuristic books you can't relate to or anything like that, but in this one, the people make sense. It also has a great mystery-type plot, which is very tricky, and I can see how it might be confusing. In the end it makes sense for the most part, and most everything is solved and done.  I enjoyed reading it, and might read it again someday.
6305280762|5.0|Firstly, this movie deserves praise for Faye Dunaway's dress that she wears throughout the entire film. But movies shouldn't all be beautiful women in provocative clothing, this movie has it all. Produced by Irwin Allen, who produced \\"The Poseidon Adventure\\" before this movie. Allen bested himself in this flick.<br />The story is relatively simple; the world's highest skyscraper catches on fire.  There is a large party on the top floor, and we watch as people fight for survival as the fire creeps towards them.  Only Steve McQueen playing a streetwise firehouse captain, and Paul Newman acting as the tower's architect can stop the fire before everyone inside dies. As I was re-watching this film I couldn't help but think of the similar situation faced by many in the 9-11 attack. Their result was not as positive.<br />throughout the film there are too many people, too many relationships, and too much death to keep track of everything. However, the important people to watch are Fred Astaire, Faye Dunaway, Paul Newman, and Steve McQueen. This is the only real weakness to the film.<br />Also, for a film that is approaching 30 years old the special effects are still good, and that will make this a good film for a long time. The images of the tower burning, the fires, and the stunts are superb.<br />At times, the acting in this film can seem a bit stiff. That's early on, however after the first 20 minutes of the film everyone seems to find their place in the film. One of the notable performances is done by O.J. Simpson, who plays as a senior security guard. The interplay between McQueen and Newman is also well done, especially since there was a good chance of major dorkdom in the architect of the \\"perfect\\" building versus the blue-collar fireman plotline.  <br />Some may complain that the movie is slow, and maybe by modern \\"immediate gratification\\" standards it is, I say that the tension builds, you care about the characters, many of which, and are left at the end of your seat. And I was watching the thing on a computer; imagine what a decent entertainment system will do.<br />This definitely is an \\"essential\\" film.
B00005O5CM|5.0|I just saw this movie for the first time yesterday evening. I had been curious to see it, because a lot of people had told me it was good. I was expecting it to be good, but it totally surpassed any expectations I had! Legally Blonde is a great movie, with AWESOME acting and a really cool storyline. Also, this movie got steryotypes right (didn't make all popular people seem bad, and all good students seem perfect).<br />Legally Blonde is the story of a girl, Elle Woods, who is really popular at her sorority. Then her boyfriend gets accepted into Harvard Law school, and dumps Elle for not being &quot;serious&quot; and the type of girlfriend he wants. Elle finally decides the only way to get back her boyfriend, who she's convinced is meant to be with her forever, is to go to Harvard, too. Elle gets in, and this is the story of her life in Harvard, trying to fit in with a group of students (and teachers) who all think she's just a preppy blonde who won't make it far.<br />I highly reccommend Legally Blonde. This is a great movie, and I hope you see it.
B00006SFLV|5.0|OK, first the show...  I presume if you are reading this you probably already know, remember or have a good idea about the plot of My So Called Life so I'll be brief.<BR>My So Called Life is the story of Angela Chase, a 15 year old high school student, her family, friends, hopes, dreams...  Angela has a crush on a handsome but vapid guy at her school.  Her bright but awkward neighbor has a crush on her.  The show follows one year in the lives of Angela and the people in her life, exactly one year, and ends with a bittersweet 'what if' that is never answered as the show was cancelled despite having a strong fan base.<BR>Anyway, this show is perhaps one of the best depictions of teenage high school life and angst ever to appear on TV, and managed to be both realistic and sweet simultaneously.  This is quite an accomplishment given the medium, and this alone should justify a viewing of this dvd set.<BR>Regarding the dvd set...  hmmm.  The first few episodes have video that looks washed out or slightly bleached.  I'm not sure if this was intentional or a problem with the transfer.  I have an HDTV, progressive DVD player, etc, and despite this the video quality just didn't seem that great.  Again, I don't know if its due to the source material or the transfer.  Its good, but not great, and it took some playing with the controls to get a good picture.  Audio is good but in my opinion the plain stereo soundtrack is much better than the remastered Dolby 5.1 soundtrack.  The Dolby remastered soundtrack has dialog that just sounds washed out by the music, and from what I could tell there was no attempt to use Dolby directional support: all five speakers gave out the same sounds.  Stick with the plain stereo track, much better quality all the way around.<BR>So... ignoring my short gripes about the dvd itself, you should rent, buy or borrow but in any case watch this show again.  You won't be disappointed!
B00005V1Y0|5.0|The first time I saw this film I fell in love with it.  Paul Mercurio is brooding and fantastic.  Not a dancer, but he plays it with such confidence it's hard to believe he isn't really Scott Hastings, a champion.  And Tara Morice will absolutly wow you.  A Spanish-Australian (?) with a fiery temper and a sweet smile.  And she dances as smooth as a bird flies.  A great supporting cast, Doug's mom Shirely is so great with her &quot;happy face.&quot;  I am a total fan of dance and dancers, I love to watch ballroom dance competitions on PBS.  And nothing's better than a slow-but-steadily-building love story in my opinion.  Baz Luhrman needs to make more films and pronto!  This film is essntial to any romantic comedy collection, it's a classic.
0156012197|5.0|Reading level is ages 9-12? I don't think so! I think a senile person on the border of death would get something out of this book! Like Alice in Wonderland, this \\"kid\\" classic has more moving beneath its surface than many \\"adult\\" novels that I've read. It would disintegrate John Grisham's entire corpus just in the space of one page! <br />Antoine de Saint-Euxpery first published this book in 1943 and since then it has been translated into a zillion languages, because like music, the language of Prince is universal. The plot is pretty straightforward. The author, a famous aviator, has mechanical trouble with his plane and is forced to land in the Sahara Desert a thousand miles from civilization. That is until a young boy approaches him out of the blue and asks him to draw a sheep for him. Sound surreal? Childhood IS surreal! Page by page, the pilot learns of the past of The Little Prince. <br />Don't expect reality here. The Little Prince lived on a small asteroid named B-612. So small, in fact that he could see 44 sunsets simply by moving a few steps every couple of minutes. He longed to explore and so was carried by a flock of birds to Earth. <br />The Little Prince has all the form of a parable or a fable, a tale that is meant to convey deeper thoughts than its superficial attributes. There are thoughts in this book on love, relationships, the emptiness of a life without either, death, spirituality, capitalism, in general, the souless existence of the adult world. I'm sure this book could be a doctoral thesis for a future professor somewhere. I will come back to this book to explore some mysteries many more times in my life, I think. Seek it out. Richard Howard is one of the greatest translators of our time. He only improves the English version of this great book.
1857993284|5.0|Jostien Gaarder's &quot;Sophies World&quot; is in my opinion the best introduction to Western philosophy.  It begins with an introduction to the study of philosophy giving a brief overview of the most general and comnmon philosophic questions such as &quot;Who am I?&quot;, &quot;Where do I come from?&quot;, &quot;Why am I here&quot;.  The novel follows Sophie Amundsen and her mysterious philosophy as they race to discover who &quot;Hilde&quot; is.<br />Each chapter generally covers one specific philosopher or one philosophic school of thought and gives a brief overview ~10 pages detailing their beliefs about the world.  Some here have argued that the novel stretches itself thin by covering so many different philosophies however, this is where I think that it succeeds.  This novel provides the most interesting and most encompassing introduction to the philosophy of reality that I have ever encountered.  Its breadth allows it to cover topics such as existentialism, marxism, and some cosmological philosophies that are largely ignored in the general literature.<br />Note that this book only concerns itself with the philosophy of reality as well as some ethics but does not touch upon too much the philosophy of science, mathematics, or to a lesser amount, morals.<br />However, if you desire to better understand the nature of the universe and our place in it or simply wish to brush up on your philosophy history, I would recommend that you buy this book.
B00006WUWP|1.0|Im sorry, but Austin Powers simple doesnt belong in the 70's....Why didnt they do a movie about one of his earlier adventures before Vanessa and Felicity?...And as for having Beyonce Knowles co-star in it, she can't act to save her life. Actually, she really doesnt do anything in it but stand there and look sexy...The humor is almost completely different than the first two. Too much bathroom humor. Even though im not a big fan of Austin Powers, I can easily say that the first two are the only ones worth seeing...
1857151399|5.0|Albert Camus' &quot;Outsider&quot; is a short, to the point, two part novel.  The first introduces us to the characters and leads up to the killing of an Arab on the beach by the principal characters.  The second follows his ordeal afterwards, his thoughts and his trial.  He is persecuted as a cold killer due to his lack of visible emotion or remorse.  He is concerned only for himself.<br />As mentioned in a previous review, this is a book of thought and questioning.  Camus questions the pillars of Western society and questions humanities uncanny ability to believe that the majority is correct and that anybody else is different and thus can be persecuted.<br />I would recommed &quot;Outsider&quot; for a quick, extremely thought-provoking read.  This classic is reknowned as one of the basic foundations of existentialist philosophy.
B000059XY5|4.0|While Batman Returns isnt a stone cold classic like 1989's Batman but the fascinating characters and great special effects make Batman Returns one of those movies that you can watch again and again and again,etc. First of all there is a stunning appeal about Michelle Pfeiffer's role in that she is the only one who is any good fighting against Batman.Also its obvious that Selana (same actress as the alter ego) is romantically and sexually lustful of Bruce Wayne.<BR>  Then there is Danny Devito as The Penguin.He does a pretty impressive job too.I think its actually sort of cute that he sends all those little penguins to do his dirty work.Its like sending kitty cats or bunny rabbits to do the job.<BR>   The movie isnt as substantial and timeless as the first Batman movie but it is indeed entertaining.
B00005U1YO|5.0|this cd kicks. i have to admit im very nostalgic about it but its just the best one that i own, well besides beautifulgarbage and c'mon c'mon.. still.. its the best one of all the cds that i own in the trance/ club genre.
B000059XXZ|5.0|There isnt a single boring moment in this movie except the scene where Vikki Vale is on her first date with Bruce Wayne but even that is somewhat fascinating.The movie starts out with 2 crooks who are disagreeing about whether Batman is real or not.The unbeleiver was proved wrong when Batman rushes up to hold him over the building. I love it when Batman says \\"Im not going to kill you.I want you to do a little favor.I want you to tell your friends about me.<br />  Then Jack Napier enters the picture as someone who is very dramatic and works in organized crime. I love the part when they go to start havoc in the chemical plant. Batman again enters the picture and uses a device to attach to Jack's face and Jack falls in.It makes no sense how he becomes the Joker from being put into a vat of chemicals but hey this is fantasy not reality.<br />  This movie is sure to please people who have a dark sense of humour.Theres tons of lines the Joker says that fall into the macabre sense of humour.For instance he uses a hand buzzer to finish off one of the workers it heats him up to death until hes dead and the Joker is like \\"Antwan got a little hot under the collar\\".<br />Batman as a character always kicks ... even against the joker.<br />  I wont say anything more except that the movie is just amazing.
B000002UAR|5.0|It is said by many that 'Revolver' is the greatest Beatles album.  In my opinion there is no doubt.  Revolver emcompasses the Beatles best work, allowing each of the Fab Four to really contribute to the album. Ringo's \\"Yellow Submarine\\" is perhaps the most popular Ringo track of all time (although he did not right it his singing is classic).  George put's in some great creativity on Revolver, from the sarcastic \\"Taxman\\" (In my opinion his best work along with \\"Something\\") to his great riff on \\"I Want To Tell You\\".  John Lennon's contributions are suberb, of course.  \\"I'm Only Sleeping\\" is a wonderful harmonious ditty.  \\"She Said She Said\\" is great as are \\"Dr. Robert\\" and \\"And Your Bird Can Sing.\\"  \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" is one of his greatest songs separating the Beatles from the pop image into a creative \\"anything goes\\" stage which led them to produce their most creative album 'Sgt. Pepper'.  Paul's contributions are his best of any other Beatle's album in my opinion.  \\"Eleanor Rigby\\" is a genious piece about the loneliness and death of an old women while \\"Here, There, and Everywhere\\" (My favorite Paul McCartney song EVER) is a brilliant love song.  \\"For No One\\" and \\"Good Day Sunshine\\" are also great.  Is 'Revolver' the \\"greatest album of all time\\" as VH1 or any die hard Beatles fan would tell you?  It just as well could be.  'Revolver' is a great album of brilliance and superlative creativity and is the Beatles BEST. GO OUT AND BUY THIS ONE MUSIC FANS OR ELSE NO LONGER CONSIDER YOURSELF A MUSIC FAN!
B000002NJS|5.0|To write a review that is good, I believe that you have to listen to the CD at least once or twice, and then more (if you don't have to force yourself to listen to it). Tha means I usually sit down about a week after I buy a CD to write a review. Not for this CD. I have already listened to it 3 times since I bought it earlier today. It is a really really good CD. My favorite songs are THE POWER OF GOOD-BYE, RAY OF LIGHT, FROZEN, TO HAVE AND NOT TO HOLD, and SHANTI/ASHTANGI. The Power Of Good-Bye is an awesome song, probably one of my favorite Madonna songs. Ray Of Light has tons of cool futuristic sounds and upbeat noises in it. Frozen is just great. It is probably one of my definite favorite Madonna songs. To Have and Not To Hold is really good and it has a great beat, that all I can say about it. I like Shanti/Ashtangi because it is really different. Even though I cannot understand whatever language she's speaking, I still love it. I really recommend this to anyone who likes upbeat music and electronica music. Even the occasional Madonna listener and those out there who have never listened to Madonna music before should try this CD out. The videos for all the songs are really cool, too. I love the FROZEN video. I recommend this CD to everyone. You won't regret this purchase. ENJOY!!!!!
0064471837|5.0|The first hundred pages go a little to slow for me, but once you start to get more into this complex world, it becomes a page-turner. I liked this book, and I am about to start on it's alluring sequal. Good luck fantasy fans.
B00004TWZF|5.0|I love this movie.  It is one of the most beautifully filmed, hypnotic movies I have ever seen.  All of the performances work in this one: Barr is perfect as the sensitive almost ethereal lead, Reno is a delight with his gruff manners and humor, and Arquette is charming as the clumsy, spell-bound love interest.  This is a dreamy, quiet, slow-moving film that takes you to a whole new world.  The sea is the real star here and it never looked more gorgeous.  The scenery, the score, all of it - just beautiful.
B000067G3C|5.0|I really liked this movie!  I thought that this movie was very interesting and creative!  I personally thought that it started out very well, and as the movie progressed, it got better.  I did enjoy all of the explosions and how the bus ran into so many things because it had to be driving at 50 mph.  I hope that they make another movie similar to this one in the near future.  I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes action and explosions!
B00005JLR2|4.0|I'm being nice when I give this movie 4 stars because it really doesn't deserve it. First of all, let me say that Disney should have done 'Treasure Island' because this futuristic adaptation is strange and dumb. Why do ships fly? Why would ships be designed to fly? The whole thing is bizarre. ... I'm giving this movie 4 stars because of the nice storyline. Aside from the [weak] treasure hunt we have Jim who never had a dad and feels like a failure to his mom. They could have done a whole movie just on that and it would have been a hundred times better. So I liked Jim's emotional problems but I didn't like anything else in this movie. Oh! And the jokes are [weak] and not funny!
B00006LPES|1.0|Well-acted for the most part, it was a relief to turn this movie off. The tension and psychosis which built but never held interest, created empathy, or suspended self, finally erupted into a confusing condonning of rape. This is one of those ugly movies that defiles the consciousness of its viewers with no higher purpose - artistic or philosophic. Your time would be better spent watching lint form in the dryer.
B0000019PA|5.0|There have been almost 200 reviews written for this beautiful album, so it would be difficult for me to add anything significant.  This is one of the most courageous, innovative, and challenging bodies of music ever recorded, regardless of genre.  The general description of acoustic-based rock music really doesn't do \\"In the Aeroplane Over the Sea\\" justice, because there is so much more going on.  <br />Here are the lyrics to the last song, \\"Two-Headed Boy, Pt. 2\\":<br />Daddy please hear this song that I sing<BR>In your heart there's a spark that just screams<BR>For a lover to bring a child to your chest that could lay as you sleep<BR>And love all you have left like your boy used to be<BR>Long ago wrapped in sheets warm and wet<br />Blister please with those wings in your spine<BR>Love to be with a brother of mine<BR>How he'd love to find your tongue in his teeth<BR>In a struggle to find secret songs that you keep wrapped in boxes so tight<BR>Sounding only at night as you sleep <br />And in my dreams you're alive and you're crying<BR>As your mouth moves in mine soft and sweet<BR>Rings of flowers round your eyes and I love you<BR>For the rest of your life in your reading<br />Brother see we are one in the same<BR>And you left with your head filled with flames<BR>And you watched as your brains fell out through your teeth<BR>Push the pieces in place <BR>Make your smile sweet to see <BR>Don't you take this away <BR>I'm still wanting my face on your cheek<br />And when we break we'll wait for our miracle<BR>God is a place where some holy spectacle lies <BR>And when we break we'll wait for our miracle<BR>God is a place you will wait for the rest of your life<br />Two-headed boy she is all you could need<BR>She will feed you tomatoes and radio wires<BR>And retire to sheets safe and clean<BR>But don't hate her when she gets up to leave
6304082428|5.0|This version of &quot;Pride and Prejudice,&quot; with Colin Firth is really good and well worth seeing.  It's pretty much true to the book, some things were added though.  It is really lovely in the scenery in England and the authentic Regency era costumes that they use.  Jennifer Ehle is great as Elizabeth Bennet.  It's very romantic and entertaining.
6303421563|5.0|Leon (Jean Reno) drinks only milk -- it is healthy and good for his stomach.  Leon needs his strength.  Leon is a 'cleaner' -- a professional hit man.<br />Leon's twelve-year-old neighbor Mathilda (Natalie Portman) purchases milk for Leon.  One afternoon Mathilda hides at Leon's apartment after returning from the grocer's.  Mathilda's parents' apartment has been raided by a DEA squad led by popper-energized Special Agent Stansfield (Gary Oldman).  Mathilda's father has been holding narcotics for Stansfield and the narcotics that Mathilda's father returned are cut with milk sugar.  Stanfield's squad demolishes Mathilda's parents' apartment and murders everybody in the apartment including Mathilda's four-year-old brother.  Stansfield's squad finds the missing narcotics, but they miss finding Mathilda.  With misgivings Leon harbors Mathilda.<br />Mathilda wants revenge for her four-year-old brother's murder.  Mathilda learns that Leon is a cleaner and convinces Leon to teach her 'cleaning skills'.  Too early Mathilda borrows several handguns and goes after Stansfield at the Federal Building.  Mathilda gets caught ...<br />French writer/director Luc Besson (\\"La Femme Nikita\\") has produced *a masterpiece* set in New York City.  The film's only flaw is a long range sniper's rifle that also shoots paintballs.  Character development for Leon and Mathilda is superb -- Leon is a professional killer but a naive man, while Mathilda is both childish and streetwise.  The cast provide great performances and Eric Serra's score reinforces the film's drama.  Luc Besson and Jean Reno set the standard for this genre with \\"The Professional\\".
1573225517|5.0|I recommended this book to someone I knew only through correspondence.  When we finally met, she asked me (accusingly) why I thought she'd like the book, and indeed why I liked it.  I knew then that things were going downhill.  The main character, Rob, and his self-centered stumbling through life provide valuable lessons in how people view themselves and the world.  Hornby gives away insights to male thinking that are tantamount to State Secrets of the Species.  Have you ever kicked yourself for screwing up a perfectly good relationship?  Read this book and feel a bit better about yourself knowing you were not the only one to do so.
B000002KK2|5.0|I originally had this on lp and now have it in my clutches on c-d. One of the best jazz vocal cds of anytime,period. On this debut cd you hear her mentor Tom Waits'influence but Jones is indeed her own bird. Rickie sings of innocence and experience of love loss and of street-smarts. All the songs are fantastic but the song &quot;Company&quot; puts her over the top.This song still makes me cry even after all these years. My wife died a couple of years after the release of this recording and during those lonely nights I played and sang &quot;Company&quot; until I cried myself silly. It is the perfect song of love lost.
014028009X|2.0|Actually I'm rating this two and a half stars.  I feel like the only person in the universe who absolutely hated the movie. However, most books are better than their movie, so i decided to read it.  I thought this book dragged on and was very repetitive. I am happy to say that in the very last chapter is when a change occurred and made me think that i like the book just a little better than the movie.  <BR>I feel that Bridget gave other singletons a bad name, she was so pathetic rather than funny.  I am a single girl myself, and if i was so obsessed with weight, how much a drank, smoked, and how nobody loves me because i don't have a boyfriend...i'm sure i would have shot myself by now!!  If you really have to read it borrow it or check it out from your library, but i think it's a waste of money.
B00006L83N|5.0|I love Symphony X. Although I play bass, i'm a guitar solo nut, and Michael Romeo does a great job of satisfying my love of solos. Whatever it is that Symphony X does, they do it right, and they rock. It's hard to put a finger on it, but it's awesome. Romeo's riffs are amazing, the the rhythm section is great and keeps the songs heavy and packed with a heavy low end. I love Russell Allen's voice; it fits with the music incredibly well. He's a great singer and his voice has a really nice edge to it that fits the 'neo-classical speed metal' music that Symph X plays.<br />As for the Dream Theater comparisons, Dream Theater are my favorite band and I knew about them before Symphony X. Basically, if you like Dream Theater's heavier songs (think Glass Prison or Lie), you will like Symphony X. When people compare them to Dream Theater, the comparison is both accurate and completely wrong. Allen and LaBrie sound nothing alike, and Romeo plays far heavier riffs than Petrucci. However, Petrucci and Romeo are both great shredders, and the keyboardists do a great job of complementing their treble-based guitar playing counterparts on solos and fills. To sum everything up, the bands are in roughly the same genre, but if you know anything, you can easily tell the difference between them; even if the singer's aren't singing yet.
B000002NC4|5.0|Wow. I never would of thought that some of the most memorable melodies that I've ever heard would come off an album that completely rejects the pop song. Pardon the cliche, but these truly are epics. There is no verse-chorus-verse. All of the songs evolve from one point to another and thats why this was one of my favorite releases of the decade. Lyriclly, Dug is once again spot-on. I don't know if I would go so far as to call him a guitar-god. The solos compliment the songs; they don't take them over. Deffinately check this out if you haven't already.
B00005JKPF|5.0|As I already saw the first one and thought it was pretty damn good I was expecting the follow up to be just as good as it's previous version, infact it exceeded all my expection. Wolverine gets to find out more about his past, all the X-Men are back from the first one and new characters are introduced such as Nightcrawler and Lady Deathstrike. It has a spectacular opening sequence and pure entertainment all the way through with a sort of biblical ending. So much action and special effects even romance you have to see this or you'll miss out even if you're not a fan watch it you wont' regret it trust me.

0385507755|4.0|'A Million Little Pieces', James Frey's stylishly different memoir, recounts his arrival and subsequent rehabilitation at a clinic. The ups and numerous downs of his stay make for an engrossing if at times squirmy read. Perhaps the best part of the book is Frey's unflinching honesty with what happened and what he felt. It takes guts to put yourself out there like that and he should be commended for his perspective. 'A Million Little Pieces' is also notable for its dead-on portrayal of a man rebuilding his life. Frey does a remarkable job getting across the conflicting emotions and needs that you feel. His attempts at reconciliation with the family he has been trying to push away his whole life are particularly good. The awkwardness, the guilt and the anger are all present and splendidly captured. It is in these moments that '...Pieces' strikes a chord the most. If you have ever wondered or experienced what it is like to find yourself in a deep hole and to try to climb out of it and lead a 'normal' life this is the book for you. Nobody tells it like Frey does.
1878424319|2.0|Not only don't waste your time, but don't waste your money.  Anything that you need to know about the four agreements can be read on the inside flap of the front cover. That about covers it and the rest of the book just embellishes in a mundane, repetitive and simplistic manner, the same theme.<br />Go to the bookstore, read the cover and move on. The rest is not worth the effort. I struggled through half the book and found the reading cumbersome.
B00004LN16|4.0|My favorite AC/DC is still AC/DC live, but their newest album is still great.  I couldn't give the album as a whole 5 stars simply because some of their songs sound way too similar and their are a few songs that rank as just decent.<BR>Stiff Upper Lipe, Safe in NYC, and Damned are 3 of my favorites.  I definately would recommend this too any AC/DC fan, especially those that have somes blues running through their veins.
B00008H2LB|4.0|Linkin' Park does make a successful comeback with this new album, Meteora, following their last smash hit album, Hybrid Theory. I liked Hybrid Theory little bit better, but Meteora definetly delivers. It's quite enjoyable and worth buying for any true Linkin' Park fan. However, this album doesn't seem to have as much unique rap-metal style as Hybrid Theory did. It's more of a hard rock album than a mix of rap-metal. But it's still a cool CD. I enjoy it.
0375823360|4.0|I think it's about time we were greeted with a literary series that shows all the qualities that 'His Dark Materials' does. I am only sixteen myself, and I find that the profound impact Christianity has on people severly limits our tolerance and imagination. With this series, though, we are entering an entirely new world so much unlike ours in the religious aspect yet so similar that I can't help but greatly appreciate and enjoy it.<br />I'm glad that Mr. Pullman has introduced the young world into such controversial subjects that parents always try to steer their children away from. Children need to realize how differently some people see things - certainly not when they're nine, but definitely by the time they're twelve. If there was one thing about these books that kept me hooked, it was the role of the Authority and the Church and the fact that they weren't what everyone believed them to be. Will and Lyra went through many trials and tribulations before they reached a definite end, and the sad fact is: that's life. Sugar-coated happiness seems to be the only thing people think children should learn, and it certainly can't be said these two children were a part of that.
B00008PW3O|4.0|OK, I admit I was a senior in HS when Rumors hit the charts, so the Mac holds a sacrosanct place in my psyche.  For many years, I had not realized how hungry I was for new Fleetwood Mac music, until The Dance was released.  I hardly dared hope that they would find a way to make a new album together without killing each other, and thought I'd have to live forever with just \\"The Dance\\" to hold onto.  Whoopee, they went back to the studio, and Say You Will does not disappoint!<br />I'm deducting a star for the lack of a prominently featured McVie (she's there in the background on several tracks - listen closely), but I think the band gets by surprisingly well in spite of her absence.  Also, because Lindsey gets a little heavy-handed with the production tricks.  Speaking of which, I am surprised that no one thus far has commented on Sheryl Crow's featured guest spot on \\"Come\\".  Although it is unmistakably Crow, I find myself wondering what it would have sounded like without all the over-produced distortion.<br />Say You Will succeeds best at what Mac does best - lovingly crafted pop tunes such as \\"Thrown Down\\", the title track, \\"Peacekeeper\\", \\"Steal Your Heart Away\\", and my favorite, an extended-solo version of \\"Bleed To Love Her\\".<br />The bonus CD features clips of recording sessions for a handful of the tunes on this album (yes, I am a child of 70s album-oriented rock - it is an ALBUM! lol).  I agree with the reviewed who opined that production of an entire DVD of the \\"making of\\" this album would be most welcome.<br />Enjoy this album - it's like opening a box you found burried deep in the backyard, with no expectations, and finding it full of little jewels.  They've been just glistening there in the dark, waiting for someone to show them the light of day.
0380820846|5.0|Julia Quinn is the perfect rare example of a romance novelist who, rather than being unable to live up to a first masterpiece, steadily continues to mature in her writing. Her first four books were fun and witty and used the same types of rather implausible background mysteries/misunderstandings that are inserted into most romance novels to maintain a reader's interest. Her next four (_Sun_, _Heiress_, _Marquis_, and _Duke_) had more believable conflicts, and though that of _Viscount_ wasn't quite as easily believed (especially to a female audience), it lived up to its predecessor by demonstrating a funnier, more mature wit and a more detailed description of how and why, precisely, the characters fell in love. _Gentleman_ had the most plausible conflict yet, although, despite definite evidence of a more mature style, I couldn't _quite_ prefer it to the poignancy of _Duke_ or the _Pride-and-Prejudice_-type transformation of _Viscount_. Now we finally come to the subject of this review, _Romancing Mister Bridgerton_, which doesn't employ a kidnapper or murderer or even a deep dark secret that prevents the hero from falling in love - and, surprisingly, doesn't need one.<br /> At 33 and 28 respectively, Colin and Penelope are Quinn's oldest protagonists so far, and also the truest and most real. This is not primarily because their characterization is the most powerful, but because they have faults and flaws and are really, truly human - extremely unusual in this genre. Even more unusual, their friendship and respect are what engender their passion and love, while 95 percent of romance novels are the other way around. This work portrays the growth and maturity of two people who each make the other a better person through their love. Some (though, of course, not all) of the book's charm would actually be lost by neglecting to read the first three of the series because, as one can tell, this is Quinn's \\"crowning jewel\\"; what the entire series has been building up to in more ways than one.<br /> Further suspense is added by the impending unmasking of Lady Whistledown, which, judging by other reviews, kept many readers interested in lieu of the stereotypical romance-novel mystery. But this love story can truly stand on its own: after reading so many reviews and reading the first three Bridgerton books in immediate succession, I was already completely positive who Lady Whistledown was, and this did not detract from my enjoyment at all. If what you're really looking for is passion, scandal, danger, and lots of love scenes, there are probably better books out there for you - but if you're looking for character growth and a sweet love story, you can't get much better than this. I haven't reread a novel so often without ever tiring of it since reading _Ella Enchanted_ when I was twelve years old, which I first read five times in a row in little more than five hours and then proceeded to read around eighty (no, I'm not exaggerating!) times over the next two years (okay, so I certainly haven't read _Romancing_ that many times - I'm no longer _insane_ like I was at that age!). I've read a lot of great, classic romance novels (by Putney, Woodiwiss, Krentz, Dodd, Heath, etc.), but somehow this one still remains my favorite and closest to my heart, alongside _Jane Eyre_, _Pride and Prejudice_, and _Persuasion_. This is what a romance novel should be.<br />~ chavi
B00000DG1R|5.0|the BEST band ever. Why? because if you really think about it-no one has EVER sounded like Duran Duran or even come close. Without a doubt, the most original band, ever! They wrote the catchiest songs, produced the best albums (does anyone know of any DD albums that are only good for their singles? - NO.)were the trendiest dudes in their day and still managed to survive the 80's. This collection is like a Bible for music lovers. Full of classics and there could have been more, had this been a double album. From their debut of \\"planet Earth\\" to the sexy \\"Union Of the Snake\\" and including Duran's most underrated single \\"I dont want your love\\". If you dont have this-get it. and catch up on old memories (because they will come back with these songs)and get ready for the reuinion tour and album. Younger people need to get this cd and familiarize themselves with Britain's greatest export. This cd includes MTV's first ever banned video,\\"Girls on Film\\", the best Bond Theme ever-\\"A View To A Kill\\" and one of the most beautifal ballads ever-\\"Save a Prayer\\"
6305313687|5.0|Well this movie is about a racist learning how wrong racism really is. Edward Norton gives the performance of his life. Im normally not the type to get touched by movies but this movie really effected every thing I believe in. Edward Norton was a huge racist and was sent to prison for killing a black male in a footpath. He was sent to prison and was betrayed by the white males there. A chris tucker like black male ended up being nortons only friend . When Norton was released from prison he realised how wrong his old view were. Only.........it was too late
0688163173|5.0|After having been exposed for the first time to Dennis Lehane last year with his terrific mystery Mystic River, I've read all that he has written.  Since that point he has yet to disappoint me.  &quot;Shutter Island&quot; is no different.<br />Lehane's novel is set in 1954 and told from the point of view of Teddy Daniels, a federal marshal sent to investigate the escape of a patient from the mental hospital on Shutter Island.  As Teddy gets deeper into his investigation, the list of people the reader can trust gradually diminishes.  Lehane keeps you guessing throughout the book and may even fool you at the end.<br />My only disappointments came at the length of the book (325 pages), simply because I was really enjoying it, and that it *screams* for an eventual movie adaptation.  At some points it seems to read more like a script.  I was entertained from page one, however, and definitely think that any mystery fan would enjoy this novel.<br />Highly recommended, especially to fans of Lehane's earlier work.
0316666343|5.0|I dunno about the people who say this book is bad, but I thought this book just truly was amazing and inspiring. The tale is a sad one, but the presectives that Sebold gives on such a touchy subject are truly interesting. It also gives a true look on people's reactions to death and life. I would definetly recommend to read it, it is one that you won't be able to put down!
B000025APX|2.0|Amon Amarth is without a doubt a talented and unique extreme metal band,but this cd can not be compared to the brillant VS. THE WORLD or OSFTGH. The songs on this release sound rather repetitive and suffer from a more straight forward death metal sound,rather than the killer viking style in .VS THE WORLD. I would suggest picking up AMON AMARTH .VS THE WORLD(WHICH IS 2CD WITH UNRELEASED SONGS AND SONGS FROM THE RARE FIRST CD)AND AMON AMARTH OSFTGH rather then THE AVENGER anyday.
6305127697|4.0|PRimal Fear is normally a movie which I would stay away from. I thought it was just another one of those wanna-be thriller movies. ITS DIFFERENT. It explores the phonemon about split-personlality and has an ending which completely puts the icing on the cake for this fabulous story about murder, greed and vulnerability.
B00008PW3Q|1.0|I see a lot of reviewers using the word &quot;Edgy&quot; to describe this CD. Translate that into shrill, dischordant and jarring. And not very interesting. If you are longing for the melodic Mac of the past, you are sure to be disappointed because listenable tunes are hard to find here. There are a few good songs, notably the title track -- and one blast from the past. But it seems to be mostly Lindsey Buckingham once again indulging himself. It might have been more accurate to title this album &quot;Lindsey Buckingham's latest ego trip&quot;  It is certainly more that than a Mac album. There are echoes of &quot;Tusk&quot;, which I always judged as one of Mac's worst because of Buckingham's over-influence. He's a talented guy but he needs to be balanced and there was not enough of that on this CD. His fingerprints are all over every song on this CD. Overall, its a disappointing effort. With Christine McVie gone, Fleetwood Mac sounds a bit empty. The harmonies are not as full. There are few new melodies you will remember. Stick to the old stuff and remember Mac as it was.
B000000993|5.0|It was with the introduction of Tool's second album, &quot;Undertow,&quot; and the accompanying video for the song &quot;Sober&quot;, that most fans first became aware of the band.  On this album, Tool introduced an unorthodox sound that was is in its own right a genre of its own.  This is probably Tool's heaviest album to date, with its metal influence showing through very clearly.  &quot;Undertow's&quot; sound is primarily rhythmical, featuring powerful, snakelike beats, accompanyed by the soft, yet explosive vocals of Maynard James Keenan.  &quot;Undertow&quot; was received with a sigh of relief in a time when radio stations where oversatured with Seattle grunge and its many imitators. This album is a must have for the record collection of any seriouse cutting edge music fan.
B000001ESJ|5.0|Let's get to the point. I'm a huge Rush fan, but for some reason I lost my original copy of this cd, so I ordered it again.<br />Starting with the one and continuing with Hemispheres, Permament Waves, and of course Moving Pictures, Rush established themselves as the pre-emininent prog-metal, philosophically minded, kick-[...] musicians. <br />The title track is like a little microcosim of all that is good in Rush music. Tight playing, great lyrics, odd meters, excellent production values. <br />anyway, 'nuff said.
B000089RVX|5.0|It is about time that a good female vocalist sings in a real band unlike the usual 'pop divas' that supposedly sing well, but have disgusting music in the background that was put into a keyboard (normally seen on VH1's diva pop up video). I think this is a good band for anyone who likes female singers and &quot;rock&quot; but tires of hearing Cher, Mariah Carey, and Christina Aguilera everytime they turn on the radio. Evanescence has somehow been compared to Linkin Park an okay band but they don't sound anything like them. Linkin Park is immature rock like Silverchair was a few years back, but Evanescence is good quality stuff that'll hopefully be around a while and more &quot;mature&quot; sounding. I also think &quot;Bring Me to Life&quot; is an okay song, but compared to the other songs, it is to &quot;trendy&quot; and doesn't do the band justice. I think the best way to think of this band is like the band &quot;A Perfect Circle&quot; (strong, flowing, well written music)...Evanescence has the same &quot;beauty&quot; to it, just with a unique style and a female vocalist. I highly recommend1
B00008X5J3|5.0|It is nice to see a movie that isn't filled with explosions, bad language, gangs, aliens, etc. Although the first 10 minutes are slow, it quickly fires up & the movie is over before you know it !  The casting was super & it's a great change to hummmmm new tunes & practice new dance steps.  I've always enjoyed the old musicals and this was wonderful to see a modern one take a chance on the big screen.  Enjoy...MBN
B00006BTCA|4.0|To those who say they don't get this record, listen to it in a blackened room at night on your own, on a loud stereo with all the atmosphere, guitar work and bass coming through into one absolutely beautiful sound.  I totally disagree with the review who said this record doesn't have atmosphere - just listen to it.<br />From the nocturnal, soundscape-centred, beautifully aching songs like 'Untitled' and 'NYC' to the cool, urban, faster tracks like 'Obstacle 1' and 'PDA', Interpol create an amazing sound. The Joy Division comparison is always made and there's something in it, mainly in the vocals, but Interpol has the guitars much more at the fore compared with JD, and they create more punchy songs with dense, warm soundscapes as opposed to the more sparse and empty JD sound. Both are dark, however, and both convey an incredible, dark, ethereal beauty.<br />'Say Hello To The Angels' is incredible, as it goes through various different sections, from an almost punky opening to a quiet section to a funky riff. Although it nicks its bassline from The Smith's 'This Charming Man' there's nothing similar in the mood there, and its an Interpol masterwork. 'Hands Away' is a sinister, string-enhanced builder very reminiscent of Disintegration-era Cure. The grittier menace of 'Roland' has an urban snarl to it, yet there's something so beautiful and desperate about the obsessive love song 'Obstacle 2'. <br />Their epic, though, is the penultimate song, 'The New', which shifts gear a million times over its 6 minutes. Like the album in general, it manages to explore a variety of sounds, speeds and styles while sounding unmistakably the same band all the time. This is a hallmark of great albums, and Interpol's album is surely one of the best in the last few years. Its not quite a classic, with a few tracks slightly under par, but its an exciting album which, really, tops everything else to come out of this current New York garage-y fad. 4 stars.
6305350205|3.0|This time William Shatner takes the director's chair and puts together the most least favorite Star Trek film. Due to a worker's strike in Hollywood, The SFX aren't as strong as the previous installations. Also, there's too much focus on slapstick humor as well. This time the Enterprise must rescue some hostages...but they are soon taken hostage themselves by Spock's half-brother Sybok &amp; taken to the center of the universe to talk with God.
B000009RC2|5.0|I started out listening to this album not ready to make the jump over to jazz-fusion..but now that the fog has cleared I realize that this is real genius work. I'm upgrading my 3 stars to 5, with embarassment for not realizing the depth of this work in the first place.
B00008S2VG|5.0|Please, Do not listen to the bad criticisms. This album is excellent ! One of the best albums of madonna ! Please listen in the first one : nothing fails, i'm so stupid, mother and father, hollywood and love profusion.
B00004T8RK|1.0|This has to be the most boring album of all time.  Right up there with Yield, Riot Act and No Code.  I don't know what it's going to take for this band to finally call it quits.  They have no talent and their lead singer just mumbles into the microphone -- you can't understand a word he's saying.  <br />If you're looking for a fresh sound, you can't go wrong with a band like Creed.  They're talented and they have passion for their work -- not like these washed up has-beens.  Pearl Jam has no real talent.  Warning: this album is horrible.  Listen to the song previews and you'll agree with me.
0345451325|4.0|As far as video-game based shoot-em ups go, this one is great. It's not high literature, but its a high as this genre can get It's lacking a bit in the human department; I wish that The Master Chief had had a more human touch to him. He is a genetically engineered super soldier with the mind of a combat machine... and not much else. We never witness him in any normal situations, such as just chit-chatting or lounging, but I spose as a combat warrior he doesnt do as much of this anyway. Still, he feels distant, and the reader may have trouble sympathizing totally with him Oh well. This isn't a character study, it's an action piece. This book reminds me in a way of the first Star Wars: an exciting and brillinat standalone work that is really only a set-up in the grand scheme of things. There is a titanic space battle between the Navy space Warships and the Covenant's, which is really cool and exciting, which is a surprise given the written medium.>Nylund is a smooth, clear writer who keeps the pace crisp. He also a genieus in the acedemic sense, and science is incorporated into the action in a way that is interesting and never boring.<BR> A great book, fun and enjoyable. Not as great as the DOOM series, but still ahead of Resdient Evil and a ... lot better than BRUTE FORCE. And, sorry to say, its a superior read than the follow up: THE FLOOD.
0743201140|3.0|The authors definitely presented some contrarian - if not completely original - thinking. The book started out promising and did indeed contain some gems, but I was left somewhat unsatisfied, given some of the stellar reviews I had read here.<br />I felt they included a good bit of filler to make 257 pages. I would have rather they spent more time on a complete review of the case studies; as it is, they just cited parts and pieces, leaving the analytical reader questioning if these examples were contrived.<br />Two-thirds into the book, the authors switched gears, moving from self reflection and managing one's own strengths and weaknesses to the area of managing others' strengths and weaknesses. They had not fully developed the first subject, but yet they ambitiously introduced a new one - which really warrants its own book.<br />I was also disappointed in the StrengthsFinder tool website. Only one pass is allowed and I could not find much explanation on how answers are processed, much less an objective third-party review of the test. This seems strange for a \\"25-year, multi-million dollar effort\\".
B00005JLEU|5.0|I saw this movie in the theaters and I was blown away by it.  Then I bought the movie a few days later and now I can watch it whenever I want.  To me this doesn't seem at all like a Disney film and I don't even know why Disney was a part of the filmmaking process.  Spirited Away is way better than Princess Mononoke and well worth your time to go see.  Anime rocks!!
B00008PW3Q|5.0|I have really had enough of the &quot;I miss Christine Mcvie&quot; crowd! Don't get me wrong...I liked Christine, and some of her songs. But I honestly have to say that I never thought of her during the first listen of this cd! This is the Fleetwood Mac record I have ALWAYS wanted. More Stevie and Lindsey, and less of Christine's fluff! This is something with substance, and it ROCKS like a FM album should! Another thing, this cd is NOT too long! I was disappointed that it didn't  become a double album as originally planned. If you think it's too long, you're just ADHD or something. There is NOT a dud on this thing! DO NOT listen to the cynics....do not listen to the Britney crowd that relates so much to Christine McVie's songs......This is up there with Rumours and Tusk! If you don't think this is one of FM's best records, then you are NOT a FM fan, and you haven't been listening!
B000069HKH|5.0|The Rising, the triumphant return of Bruce Springsteen and the E-Street Band, is the first album to center on September 11th and it will probably be the best. Springsteen rejects the obvious routes of the hallmark sentimentality and zealous patriotism. Instead he chooses to be intelligent, frank and achingly human. \\"You're Missing\\" addressing those who lost someone on that unreal day and \\"Countin' On a Miracle\\" in which a  disillusioned man seeks comfort in a lover's arms are the works of songwriter who genuinely writes from heart.<br />The Rising is no downer, though. Springsteen evidently felt no need to switch into singer/songwriter mode a la Nebraska and The Ghost of Tom Joad. The E-Street Band reunited for one reason: to rock and, from the moment the violin ensemble meets with a wham from drummer, Max Weinberg on \\"Lonesome Day,\\" they do just that. And why shouldn't they? The fiery, anthemic feel of The River and Born in the USA has always been capable of handling the heaviest of subject matter. The extra oomph, in fact, adds to The Rising's best trait: its spirit of survival. Take a listen to the metaphoric \\"Waiting on a Sunny Day,\\" the dreamy \\"My City of Ruins\\" and the absolutely enthralling title track for examples. The Rising is not an album that statically reflects on tragedy, it is one that inspires strength.
B00008CHEU|5.0|This album is one of the best albums i've ever listened to.<BR>I've been a fan of tatu since the first time i heard attss, they are a refreshing duo from Moscow, Russia, who claim to be in love with each other. Whether you believe this or not, it does not effect the quality of Lena and Yulia's talent. They have studied music for 8 years, and this shines through their music. This album was recorded in London last year with the help of Trevor Horn, of which the girls are big fans of and were delighted to have worked with him.<BR>One of my favourite songs on this album is \\"How soon is now?\\", this is a cover of The Smiths, you may also recognise it from the theme tune from \\"Charmed\\" (shown on channel 5 and living tv), some people even believe tatu's cover of this is better than the original!! which i also agree with.<BR>200 km/h in the wrong lane also contains the famous \\"all the things she said\\" and the up coming single \\"not gonna get us\\".<BR>Malchik gay is a catchy, european sounding tune,\\"Show me love\\" deffinitely caught me attention with the line \\"Like a game of pick up sticks, played by .... lunatics\\" lol.<BR>The russian edition of this album, was released back in 2000, and is deffinitly a must have to complete the set.
0060537639|5.0|As a kid in school, when I learned about exploration by the Europeans and looked at some of the European maps that showed lands that they had yet to discover, I wondered who had been there first to map it.  In March, I found this book, and it all made sense.<br />I knew some Chinese history from school, but it was mainly ancient China BCE.  This book helped to fill in the gaps.  When you read about the size of their ships, compare them to European ships at the time, and get a sense of their maritime history, you get a sense of excitement that what the author proposes must be true to some degree.  Further research will show how much of it is true...especially of the stones left worldwide and the sunken ships made of teak.<br />To me, there is too much evidence to discount the theories in this book.  I imagine they will be refined over time...and am curious about the final verdict.<br />After reading this book just after the book Lies My Teacher Told Me by James W. Loewen, I don't know how history teachers in our educational system can sleep at night.  Why is it that we have to learn so much credible history in our 20s and 30s for the first time?
B000066NW0|3.0|Okay, so as a fan of the punk music that is so often used in reviews of Lavigne's music, I can definately say that, duh, her music isn't punk.  I can also say she's also not alternative as has been credited, given that her lyrics are all high school-y and about boys (or bois, pardon me).  But here's the thing: that's not neccesarily bad.  So what if her music is poppy, that's okay.  Blondie did the same thing in the 1980's, taking punk and making it displayable as a marketable radio-friendly product.  Granted Avril is no Debbie Harry (oh god, is she light years away from that), but she's got talent, and you can't sell 3 million records on a falsified image alone.  I admit, some of the songs on the album are pretty weak singles ('Anything But Ordinary', while displaying lyrics about alienation, is so overproduced it's hardly music, and 'My World' is just a big load of .... meant to appeal to little girls everywhere who think that the priveleged Lavigne lived a life 'just like me'), but some are also extremely good and, had they been sung by other singers (i.e. more modern or older singers) they would've sold to no end (such as the great 'Nobody's Fool', the simple but interesting 'Too Much To Ask', and finally the strong 'Mobile', which, trust me, is far superior in acoustic form than in the recorded version on the album).  All in all, it's a pretty good album that shows great potential.  Up the antee a little, Ms. Lavigne, on the second album, and you could very well be on your way to being our generation's buzz artist.
B00000ILDE|5.0|The Special Edition DVD of Aliens is amazing.  Not only is it a great movie but the extras in it are great, all the way from the multiple trailers to the additional footage.<br />This happens to be one of my favorite movies that I can watch over and over again.  It has a lot of action, good coheisive storyline and if you pay attention you can even catch a hint of a little romance.  If you like sci-fi you have to see this movie.  A great addition to any DVD collection.
0688163173|5.0|All the reviews I've read are talking about the huge surprise ending.  Forget about that.  I figured it out pretty early on in the novel.<br />What makes this novel so right are the characters and the emotion.  Teddy's journey is one of the most wrenching journeys I've ever read.  I read the final two chapters with a knot in my stomach.  And I've never done that.  Hugely suspenseful, hugely exciting.  A great, great novel.  Too bad we'll probably have to wait two years until the next one.<br />-Dave
B00000ILDF|3.0|The movie was alright, the only thing that really saves it is the ending.  The ending is a rather nice cap for the series.  However there is very little that is good about this DVD.  Very few extras.  It was kind of a let down, as was the movie.  I would buy this movie only if you want the complet Alien Legacy.  Of course I pretend like Alien Ressurection doesn't exist but that is a whole different review.
B00006JJ1O|4.0|I like all types of music. If something sounds good, I'll like it. I don't care who it's by, if it's on the radio or not, if the artists even perform or compose their own songs. That said, I really do like some of T.A.T.U.'s songs. However, they make me think a lot of Milli Vanilli. Download a video of T.A.T.U. performing live and it's a joke! They are soooo lip synching! That makes me wonder if the 2 girls even really sing on the album. Anyway, it still sounds good. I just question what's really going on here. Whoever composed the songs is very talented. Same goes for the singers...whoever they are.
B00008S2VG|4.0|I really enjoy this album better than \\"Music\\" and \\"Ray of Light\\". It's because I do prefer guitar sound. <br />My opinions for all the tracks are as followed:<BR> <BR>-1- AMERICAN LIFE<BR>An average track to open the album. Well, it's not a masterpiece but I'm glad that she proves ppl that she can rap.<br />-2- HOLLYWOOD<BR>Flat after first listen but it definitely is a slow grower. One of the catchiest and pop songs in the album. Cool effects.<br />-3- I'M SO STUPID<BR>One of my favorite tracks. A cool rock pop song and I really love the line 'Stupider than stupid'.<br />-4- LOVE PROFUSION<BR>Although it's a good song to be a single, I think Madonna will not because it sounds similar to Don't Tell Me in style. A bit arranged like songs from \\"AIR' towards the end, coool.<br />-5- NOBODY KNOWS ME<BR>Take this as 'PLUTO' in Bjork's Homogenic album in this album. A cool dance song.<br />-6- NOTHING FAILS<BR>The best written song in this album. No need to say much.<br />-7- INTERVENTION<BR>Another one of my favorite tracks. Good guitar sound. She will release an unplugged album in future, I think.<br />-8- X-STATIC PROCESS<BR>It's like 'I DESERVE IT' from her Music album. Like it since the first listen<br />-9- MOTHER AND FATHER<BR>I like this version and her unplugged live version. She may release this as the 4th single.<br />-10- DIE ANOTHER DAY<BR>A intense techno song. Everyone has listen to it b4.<br />-11- EASY RIDE<BR>A bit emotional piece. A good song to end this fantastic album.<br />She has achieved a standard where she is making an album with all good songs rather than few good tracks and teribble filler songs. This is a standard album which she will raise it up again with her next one...
B00008DDXC|4.0|I really enjoyed this chapter in Harry Potter's life.  However, I found that some of the story lines were not as well explained as others, and that there were quite a few moments that seemed like elements were added just to jump the movie to the next point.  However, I did not see the theatrical release, and this DVD has added scenes... not knowing what was added.  It is a little long (2.5 hrs) for a young child and even some adults.  However, I still enjoyed it thoroughly.  It has wonderful elements of suspense and action.  It is a definite must-have for your DVD collection!
B00005JKPF|5.0|I already wrote a review of this movie,but yesterday I saw the movie and I have to say it just rocks!!! You discover a whole lot of Wolverine's past,and you see wolverine's new nemesis,Lady Deathstrike. Mystique plans a way to get Magneto out of jail and then they go to see the X-Men who were about to crash in the jet into a forest. When Magneto saves the X-Men from crashing,he explains that Stryker persuaded him into revealing the secrets of cerebro. Then,they go to Alkali lake to stop Stryker's evil plot to kill all mutants with cerebro. Then,wolverine rediscovers his past and fights Lady Deathstrike and supposely kills her(believe me,Deathstrike is not dead). Later,when Magneto and Mystique stop cerebro,they reverse it to kill all humans instead of mutants. Of course the X-Men stop it. Then Pyro joins Magneto and leaves with him to become part of the brotherhood. Jean Grey supposely sacrifices her life to save the X-Men,but at the ending you see the form of a pheonix under the water. What could that mean? Of course it means Jean is still alive. So at the end it's obvious they're going to make X-Men 3. And the real war will come between Magneto's brotherhood and Xavier's X-Men.
B00006HBUA|3.0|My 11 year old loves this movie, but I thought it was, at times, painfully cheesy.  However, what can we expect?  It is based off a cartoon!  I do think it is a good representation of the the cartoon characters set in a more realistic setting.  It does have a good number of elemental surprises, which makes it something adults can enjoy.
B000069CWE|3.0|'Reanimation' from Linkin Park is an album that I only listein to from time to time.Sure,its not horrible,but its not that great either.Most of the songs are remixes from the album 'Hybrid Theory' but they are spelled differently in a strange way(just look at the song titles).There are a few new songs,too but they are not very good.It has many guest appearances from members of bands like the X-Cutioners,KoRn,Staind and more.I suggest that you should sample some of the clips from Amazon.com before listeining to this because you may not like it.I wouldent buy it unless you are a   H-U-G-E Linkin Park fan.
0553212478|4.0|I studied this book, &quot;Frankenstein&quot;, in my 12th Grade English Literature class. There are some slow parts, but overall an adventure to read. Victor Frankenstein's family at the beginning, his &quot;nervous fevers&quot;, how he created the monster and became obsessed with his work, his marriage to his cousin, Elizabeth, etc...it's all there, but the reader such as myself has more sympathy for the monster than Frankenstein himself because of the monster's longing for love. It's a good book for students and anyone who enjoys tragedies (it doesn't really seem to be like a horror story though).
B00005JKPF|4.0|The movie was a hit, even on the second day of its release, the Lowells Cineplex was completely packed, with 4 full theaters. The movie is quite similar to the first X-Men movie, but with one more added detail - Striker trying to destroy all the mutants on earth. The movie was impressive, and with some parts of humor. The movie should introduce Striker, and who he is, even if he was introduced in the first movie, people do forget. The movie was great, but there were parts that weren't as good. For instance - the clawed female (she was pure hearted, but was killed because of the fight with wolverine) & Jene's death, or at least thats what the characters pointed out, if you noticed at the ending, when the Professor looks out from his window to the ocean, he says that things will be good after-all, I'm guessing that Jene is still alive. Even though X2 was 2 hours and 30 minutes, its worth the watch.
B000068PQ0|4.0|Several really really great tracks here, but 2 of the songs don't gel.  One is just a bunch of yelling and discordant noise and that has been done a million times starting with the Velvets.  The CD as a whole tells a narrative that is both tongue-in-cheek and broadway-musical-esque. The singing is great most of the time.  I find myself listening to it a lot but I still don't like the some of the slower sadder ballads, even if they are not meant to be taken 100% seriously.
B00005JKPF|5.0|I hated the first movie a blazing pasion serpassed only by my hate of the new \\"Star Wars\\" films. I have to tell you I thought this movie kicked total ...!! From the first moment a failed assination attempt on the president to the goverment takeover of the mutant school.  Thats just the begining the action in this flick takes hold and it doesn't let go untill the movie stops.  <br />A few points <br />The Bad <br />A. Don't take your young kids to see this there are several scary parts that are sure to have them screaming(at least that was the case for the kds in my theater)<br />B. Sorry Cyclops fans out there he really doesn' thave much of a role in this one. <br />C. It seemed at times that this movie didn't know what it was trying to achomplish. It has somewhere in the neighborhood of 4 writters and it really shows when all is said and done. <br />The Good <br />NIGHTCRAWLER-My god this guy is cool!!<BR>Pyro:-Great balls of fire!!<br />General Stricker(Brian Cox) Man talk about a creepy villian this guy is great!<br />Magneto: Friend or Foe? You decide <br />Overall-Excellent just great forget X1 and get this on video when it comes out
0761536434|5.0|Amusing, thorough, and informative.  Worth the price for the interview snippets alone!  I consider this to be the best book on the history of interactive electronic entertainment; it doesn't view games as some newfangled phenomenon, and it's stuffed to the brim with juicy corporate dirt and historical tidbits you haven't read anywhere else.  It examines why some projects fail and looks beyond the USA.  A great addition to anyone's collection.
0385503954|2.0|I didn't care to much for this book, I really was falling asleep and had to put it down after Leon (first 51 pages)came home.  I didn't find it interesting and it couldn't hold my attention.  I'm amazed at how people have such diverse opinions about this book, this interests more than the reading!
B000088E6P|1.0|i bought this cd hoping this would be the greatest rap album ever! but after I listened to it I was totally wrong. This is the worst rap album ever. 50 cent doesnt compare to LL cool j.He is still the greatest rapper ever!
B00008S2VG|2.0|Has anyone noticed that the photo of Madonna on American Life looks like a cross between Heidi Fleiss and Che Guavara? Tisk tisk missy.  Terribly unoriginal cover, though very appropriate for a terribly unoriginal recording.
B00005JKPF|4.0|I just saw X-Men 2 and I must say I was blown away. I liked the first but after seeing this one I saw just how good the first one could have been. The first was basically just a small introduction. Now that all the characters were introduced we have a sequel that's all action and has no time for introduction. The result is one [heck] of a ride, this film gave me the feel that I was actually watching the cartoon series from the 90's that I loved. I can't say the first film really gave me that feel at all eventhough I did like it.<br />  I have a problem with the fact that they didn't give Wolverine and Lady Deathstrike a history. In the comic book they were ex lovers. Deathstrike blames Wolverine for the death of her scientist father in the comic, you don't get that here. Instead she's just a mutant being controlled by the evil mutant hater General Striker (Brian Coxx \\"the original Hannibal Lector from Manhunter\\"). I also disapointed that the first film didn't give Wolverine and Sabortooth a history as well. I was hoping they'd bring Sabortooth back so they could have Wolverine figure out that his past connects to Sabortooth.<br />  The first also was short, it spent most of it's time introducing the characters when not all of them were even there. In this sequel we don't get Beast or Gambit but we do get Night Crawler. Alan Cummings \\"Spy Kids\\", pulls off the role just awesome. The special effects that make it so he can appear where ever he wants are just great. The make-up for that character are well done as well. Colosis who is also another popular X-Man has a short but cool cameo where he saves some mutant children at the school.<br /><br />  This film is a lot more like the comic book than the first and should do many X-Men fans proud. The whole Jean Grey sub-plot will surprise but delight most X-Men fans such as myself. I don't wanna give anything away but I find that with Jean Grey the film does have sort of a Star Trek 2 ending. Part 3 already is giving me a Star Trek 3: The Search for Spock sorta feel and it's not even out yet. Part 3 will probably be largely surrounded around Jean Grey's character just like Star Trek 3 was with Spock. I can't wait for that though. I don't wanna give anything but for any X-Men fans that know of the Phoenix saga you are gonna love this. I wouldn't mind seeing a new Mutant villain come around for the 3rd one as well though. I'm dieing to see Juggernaut for instance. Apocolyse would be cool as well. X-Men 2 is another strong movie for Marvel and could possibly be the best. Yes even better than Spiderman.tar Trek 3: The Search for Spock sorta feel and it's not even out yet.

B00006F7XJ|5.0|The title aptly describes the recording as would be a similar title: Cheerio Old Chaps. <br />This recording does not have the 'classic' etheral/melodic keyboard dominated tone found on Camel mid 70's recordings such as Mirage, Snow Goose, Moonmadnees or Rain Dances.<br />Neither does it have the heavily synthesised pop oriented Alan Parsons Project tone, which was found on Stationary Traveller.<br />Rather, it has an English folk tone ala Jethro Tull's Songs from the Woods and Heavy Horses and souring guitar playing reminiscent of Pink Floyd's David Gilmour.<br />The classic etheral and melodic tone is found in the acoustic guitar playing, vocals and flute. Anyone who is aware of keybordist Guy Leblanc's terrific band, Nathan Mahl, knows that Maul is a strong jazz fusion element in his playing<br />That said it is a delightful feel good recording that is good as any so called &quot;Classic&quot; Camel recording, just the sound is different<br />Out of 10, it gets an 8
B000002C1W|4.0|It's a great album.<BR>I'm sure it's not one of the best Floyd albums, but is sure much deeper than what some people think. It's musically deeper than The Final Cut, for sure.<BR>The lyrics are great in almost all songs (like Sorrow, On The Turning Away or Yet Another Movie).<BR>I think it was a great way to put Pink Floyd into the 80's sound. I Hate the 80's! but this is one of the few 80's albums that i really like.<BR>The first time i listened to it i was fascinated, i loved this album from the first time.<BR>The best songs:<br />Dogs Of War: great strong and dark blues, with an amazing guitar solo, a wonderful saxo solo and a great drum part (with a wonderfully heavy drum sound).<br />On the Turning Away: I think DG sings its best in this song. Great Lyrics, melody and music. The ending guitar solo... it's just amazing, perfect.<br />Yet Another Movie: A great song, with a wonderful atmosphere and a mind breaking guitar solo.<br />Terminal Frost: Wonderfull instrumental song, a great combo of Guitar and Saxo. I really love this song.<br />Sorrow: well... maybe one of the best floyd songs ever. The Lyrics are just fantastic and really deep. This song has a great sound and a brilliant drum part. The Ending guitar solo... i can say it's one of the greatest solos i've heard in my life,<BR>DG plays a heavy brilliant solo, full of feelings and great ideas. He shows why he is considered one of the best guitarists(the best, in my opinion) .<br />Give this album a chance. Don't let Waters' fans take you to the wrong side. Listen to it, pay atention carefully to this album, because it has a lot to say if you listen to it without previous ideas about it in your head.
B00006CXXU|5.0|This Cd is a must have. There are so many different types of music in this one CD that it will keep you entertained forever! This CD is way better than her first. It uses all of Christinas vocal abilities. There are songs that you can party to and songs that you can cry for. They really give you an isight in to all that Christina has been through and what everyone has said about her. I am shure that if you buy this CD you will be happy with your decision
0385504209|5.0|This was a completely enjoyable book to read.  The author took a very interesting topic, and took it through all kinds of twists and turns to the readers delight.<br />Definitely worth reading for both the story and the interesting facts.

B00003CXDB|5.0|This is my favorite movie, and in my opinion, the greatest ever made. Not only is this movie extremely deep in substance and thought provoking dialogue, but there are some great examples of moral values, as well. Not only is this movie a classic (a long classic, 126 minutes), but should be viewed by everyone who enjoys watching great movies and learning more about the greedy decade of the 1980s. This is such a great movie, I've memorized it line from line.
B000067J1Q|5.0|Having just recently purchased a 27&quot; flat-sceen TV, DVD player, and stereo receiver &amp; speakers to go with it all, I needed something to try out my new system and demonstrate all this high-tech, 2003 equipment.  A 1965 movie musical to do the above?<br />You bet.  The moment the movie started I was transported, through my humble surroundings, to a grand movie palace as I knew as a kid in the 60's.  Watching The Sound of Music simply blew me away.  I never experienced this film on TV quite like this before.  The sound ~ full &amp; rich, the picture ~ sharp, lush, and brilliant, and the total Artistry it took to create the film version of the beloved Rodgers and Hammerstein Broadway musical ~ all combine to overwhelm one's senses in ways that most films cannot or will not do today.
0743244249|2.0|It sounds like a recipe for the great American novel - New York City, pre-9/11, high finance, technology, greed & chaos, and all of it filtered through the prism of Don Delillo.  So what went wrong?  \\"Cosmopolis\\" should, by all means, be standing along side \\"White Noise\\", \\"Libra\\", and \\"Mao II\\" as a timeless literary achievement but sadly it falls beside Delillo's last novel - \\"The Body Artist\\" - as a ponderous dud.  That's not to say \\"Cosmopolis\\" is without poetic passages - a handful at best - but they come too few and far between to recommend the book as a whole.  The story in a nutshell - a billionaire takes a long days journey into night to get a haircut.  The limo ride across town becomes a revolving door of characters punctuated by countless stops along the way - meals, bookstore browsing, a presidential motorcade, sex, a pop stars funeral, an eco-terrorist/suicide demonstration and a sea of naked movie extras.  The situations become more and more absurd by the page and the dialogue remains stilted throughout.  Imagine \\"American Psycho\\" as written by Samuel Beckett.  The overwhelming sense of boredom and disillusionment that permeates the book is so potent, readers are at risk of being infected to the point they become bored and disillusioned with Delillo himself.  The book feels superficial and hollow - much like the stretch limo on it's cover - and perhaps there are deeper meanings buried within, but good luck finding them through all that surface glare.  One may begin to wonder if Delillo hasn't already shot his last fertile load with the massive \\"Underworld\\" - but wait we must for his next stab at greatness to see if this is the case.  Like \\"The Body Artist\\" before it, \\"Cosmopolis\\" is a very short book but a very long read.  Look for it on remainder tables in record time.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|When I first watched this movie, I really wasn't sure where it was going.  But movies that make you ask questions are usually the ones that turn out to be the best.  It's funny, it's sad, it's wierd, it's worth it.  When I first saw this movie, it was when I bought it on DVD and I do not regret buying it.  I don't want to spoil the plot so I won't get into it. As a DVD I think it is great also.  They offer the video to Gary Jule's remake of Tears for Fears &quot;Mad and World&quot;  and not only is it a great remake but a great video.  The deleted scenes are very good also, though I would watch it with the commentary first then without it because when the commentary is on you can't really hear the dialogue.  It also gives you a list of the actors and crews past works and gives you some ideas of other movies to see.  On the back of the DVD it compares the movie to Stir of Echoes and Final Destination.  It really isn't like either of those movies except for a topic or two related to Donnie Darko.  Even if you don't buy it, at least go out and rent it.
0316666343|5.0|I really enjoyed reading Lovely Bones.  Seabold beautifully and romantically transcended her character's need and desire to love by skillfully describing acts of rape, having visions of the deceased, longing to live again, not just on the main character's part, and many other explicitly decribed weavings of suspense and activity.  Lovely Bones was truly a remarkable novel written with grace and sensitivity. <br />I would recommend this book to individuals who long to be engrossed and compelled to finish a novel about the various sins committed in each of the characters attempt to achieve unconditional love.
B00005JKNF|5.0|This is not a movie to watch just once.  This is a movie you have to watch over and over and over -- and you find something new each time.  Wonderful plot, wonderful actors, wonderful story.  Only a minor problem - but, that is fixed by watching the deleted scenes in the special features section.  That answered a question I had -- they should have used all the scenes, they were too good to leave out!
B00005JLEU|3.0|In Hayao Miyazaki's Oscar-winning animated feature, \\"Spirited Away,\\" a young girl by the name of Chihiro and her parents stumble across an abandoned \\"amusement park\\" that turns out to be a mysterious bathhouse for the spirit world (a la \\"Carnival of Souls\\").  After her parents are turned into pigs, the young girl must infiltrate the bathhouse to find a way to make them human again.  Chihiro encounters an amazing array of strange and exotic creatures abiding there, some of whom help her in her quest and some of whom don't.<br />No one would ever deny the visual splendor and wealth of imagination that have gone into the look of this film.  The animators have created an entire world filled with inhabitants that defy description.  Moreover, the elegance of the backgrounds and the fluidity of the movement provide some of the best work in those areas that animation has ever offered.  One appreciates the effort, especially in this day and age when imagination in movies is at such a premium.  Therefore, I feel like a bit of an ingrate pointing out that \\"Spirited Away\\" might actually have been a somewhat better film had the filmmakers opted for a little LESS imagination in favor of a little more discipline in the storytelling.  The filmmakers are so busy trying to dazzle us with their creativity that we end up with more characters and subplots than the film can reasonably cope with.  The story often feels arbitrary in nature, with events that seem unrelated to each other vying for our attention just so we can be impressed with how creative everyone is trying to be.  The film seems to ramble for a good part of the time, and we find ourselves yearning for a tighter, more streamlined narrative to help keep us involved.  In addition, there's a certain lack of logic that runs through most of the film, making us question why certain characters do what they do.  For instance, why would a bunch of spirits be so concerned with eating, sleeping, making money, riding trains, etc.?  The rules of this world don't seem to be laid down rigorously enough for us to understand what it's all supposed to be about.<br />I don't want to sound like a total curmudgeon in criticizing a film that, apparently, many people, including innumerable critics, have hailed as a masterpiece.  And I do concede that \\"Spirited Away\\" has moments of great beauty and charm to more than compensate for its rather slow pacing and excessive length.  A haunting trip on a ghostly train is, perhaps, the highlight of the film, a transcendent moment that hints at how great the rest of the film could have been had its makers not felt the need to pad out the story so consistently.  Chihiro is a spunky, poignant and noble heroine, and a few of the other characters are compelling as well.<br />\\"Spirited Away\\" offers much for the audience to gape and marvel at, but it lacks the drama to make us really care.The rules of this world don't seem to be laid down rigorously enough for us to understand what it's all supposed to be about.<br />I don't want to sound like a total curmudgeon in criticizing a film that, apparently, many people, including innumerable critics, have hailed as a masterpiece.

B00008CLOA|3.0|The SQ Quad version as mentioned below does not in any way compare to the British Q8 Quad version. Seek this one out for a true discrete listening pleasure. The SACD sounds more like a widened stereo than true surround. Why couldn't Alan Parsons do the new mix instead of Guthrie? The 30 year old Q8 Quad mix Parsons did blows away this new 'current technology' mix Guthrie has come up with.<br />Stereo wise this is the best version available but you need a SACD player to the hear the stereo track as well as the multichannel track. As Gilmour said, this is the first release to go back to the first generation multitracks. That makes all the difference!

Definitely makes you think as well as entertains!  Buy it!
B00008S2VG|5.0|this cd succeeds where \\"music\\" did not: it surpasses \\"ray of light\\". though \\"music\\" was fun, it was a musical identity-crisis, leaping from joy to gloom from one song to the next. \\"life\\" maintains a subdued melancholy throughout, much like \\"ray of light,\\" but goes even further in stirring your emotions. madonna and mirwais' production here is as lush as  orbit's on \\"ray of light,\\" but \\"life\\" has a more daring sound. here's a glimpse at the 11 tracks:<BR>1. american life - you've already heard it and either you love it or hate it; whatever the case, it sounds different as one part of a larger work than it does as a single. it effectively summarizes the sound of this album by encapsulating acoustic guitar, zigzagging synths, an in-your-face verse, and a beautiful chorus.<BR>2. hollywood - edgy, cool and upbeat. the melody makes an instant imprint on your brain. this is the sound of the future.<BR>3. i'm so stupid - this could be a track by garbage. it takes madonna even further into an alternative/rock sound than candy perfume girl and is just as addictive a song. the lyrics (e.g., \\"everybody's looking for something/everybody's stupid, stupid) inspire us to examine what's really important in life.<BR>4. love profusion - madonna sings this with such yearning and sincerity, you'd think it was a bootleg demo track from before she was signed to her record deal. the folk-pop instrumentation adds to the early-80s vibe. <BR>5. nobody knows me - this track employs the same vocal effects as \\"nobody's perfect\\", but unlike that dreary tune, this number is pure, pulsating pleasure. madonna makes a sparse, mechanical synth loop sound absolutely melodic. <BR>6. nothing fails - this seems to be everyone's favorite and it certainly stands out as an instant classic. nothing experimental here, just a timeless, touching ballad. if this ends up being a single, it will sound out-of-place amidst all the syrupy \\"american idol\\" drivel played on the radio.<BR>7. intervention - madonna revealsher most hopeful, vulnerable side here as the gorgeous harmonies on the chorus transport you to a place where love triumphs over negativity. this is one track you won't be able to get enough of: it's pop perfection.<BR>8. x-static process - madonna takes a cue from jewel and tori amos on this quiet ballad. absolutely refreshing.<BR>9. mother and father - shades of kylie and early madonna. this is the best dance-pop song madonna has ever created. the lyrical theme contrasts nicely with the sound.<BR>10. die another day - the bond theme positively gleams in its new album setting. it's a whole new thrill to hear it here.<BR>11. easy ride - alternating strings and percussion underline madonna's suzanne vega-esque vocal. the same way the heartwrenching \\"gone\\" closed \\"music\\", this track meaningfully ends the incredible journey of \\"american life\\". <BR>this cd is heavy stuff, so it might not interest the casual listener the way \\"erotica\\", \\"bedtime stories\\", and \\"music\\" did. but if you're looking for substantial pop music, you'll agree that madonna has created a masterpiece.
B00008H2LE|4.0|Linkin park, let me say, does not follow the crowd. They are so different, what genre are they anyway? Rap metal punk, I'd say. But they do have six people in the band, so they have to have all the people do something. Anyway, here's my ratings.<BR>1. Foreword-2/10. This is 13 seconds long and has no instruments.<BR>2. Don't stay-8/10. One of their best.<BR>3. Somewhere I belong-8/10. This one is okay, but it's too popular right now. Don't follow the crowd! They have better songs.<BR>4. Lying from you-7/10. just plain average, but still good.<BR>5. Hit the floor-9/10. Chester does such a good job with the chorus in this! It's good to listen to over and over!<BR>6. Easier to run-8/10. Sounds like lying from you.<BR>7. faint-7/10. average.<BR>8. figure.09-7/10. see faint.<BR>9. breaking the habit!-10/10. Very good song. This one does not sound like all the others, great instruments, and they had an orchestra come in and play, too. Best song by a long shot.<BR>10. from the inside-8/10. I remember this one being slower, but it's not one of my favorites.<BR>11. nobody's listening-9/10. One of the better songs, for sure. this song has a really good chorus.<BR>12. session-7/10. see figure.09<BR>13. numb-7/10. You know, this song sounds like all the others. see session.<br />Hey, wait! When you pay the extra five bucks for this thing, you get a DVD! The dvd is awesome, it's funny tooo, cuz they are playing tricks on eachother in a spooky old motel. This CD case is cool. It's really thick, and you get a forty page book of stories, lyrics, and the pics. Get this now If you liked either of their first CDs.
B00009APK1|5.0|\\"Those thieves.  They've stolen my precious, and we wants it!\\"  With this line, the creature Gollem is finally shown, and let me tell you, the special effects team really delivered on this one!  He looks amazing, and it appears as if he's really in the movie with Elijah Wood and Sean Astin.  Anyway, once again, the movie lived up to the hype surrounding it.  We all already knew that the story was good, but we weren't sure how it would be adapted for the movie version.  Fortunately, there were only a few changes here and there, but despite those changes, it was still a terrific movie.  The special effects were even better than the first, and the battle of Helm's Deep is one of the greatest battles in film history.  Ok, the story picks up right where The Fellowship of the Ring left off.  Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli are still searching for Merry and Pippen, who escaped their captors, and have met the Ents.  Frodo, Sam, and Gollem are still taking the ring to Mordor, and Gollem decided to act as their guide.  Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli are then forced to participate in the Battle of Helm's Deep, Merry and Pippen join the Ents in the Seige of Orthanc, and Frodo and Sam are brought to Boromir's home, Gondor.  Gandalf also returns as Gandalf the White, and he aids at Helm's Deep.  Finally, the movie wins the award for the best one person dialogue (Gollem and Smealgol)!  The movie perfectly continues a perfect begginning, and we can only hope that Return of the King continues the tradition.
B00003CWL6|5.0|THIS MOVIE ROCKED! I LOVED IT! IT WAS GREAT! I ENJOYED IT ALL! I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT A FIRST-TIMER DIRECTED IT! WOW WOW WOW WOW! COULD THERE BE A GREATER DRAMA THAN THIS?! IT WAS A SUPERB FILM WITH FANTASTIC THEMATIC ELEMENTS THAT MADE IT STAND OUT ABOVE THE REST OF THE NOMINEES AT THE OSCARS!! I FOUND IT TO BE VERY POWERFUL AND IT MADE ME TEAR-UP A LITTLE AT THE END!! WHAT CAN YOU SAY ABOUT ANNETTE BENING? SHE WAS GREAT AND I FELT FOR HER AS HER HUSBAND WAS FANTACISING ABOUT AN 18 YEAR OLD GIRL! AND KEVIN SPACEY! HE WAS AS GOOD AS ANYONE COULD BE! HE DESERVED TO WIN THE OSCAR! AND SO DID ANNETTE! I LOVED THIS FILM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00005JKPF|5.0|Wow, I thought that the first X-Men movie was great.  This completely blows it away.  Almost all of the actors have returned (Pyro and Shadowcat being the exceptions) and they all gave wonderful performances, but once again, the special effects were the shining stars of the film.  This time, the story is about a mutant hater who has devised a plan to eliminate every mutant on Earth, but he needs Prof. X to do it, so he kidnaps him.  The X-Men are forced to temporarily side with Magneto and Mystique in order to save Xavier and themseleves from annihilation.  A nice addition to the team is the teleporting Nightcrawler, and Rouge, Iceman, and Pyro get bigger roles.  The script corrected most of the problems that the first movies had, so there were no flubbed lines, such as the lightning/Toad thing in X-Men.  Finally, the fight between Wolverine and Lady Deathstrike was amazing!  If you liked the first movie, you will love this one.  If you didn't like the first one, you may still like this one.  I mean, the first one was great, but this one was so much better.  You will love it!
0061020710|3.0|I picked up this book because Terry Pratchett had done some work with Neil Gaiman, who I think is simply brilliant, and I wanted a fun romp through another world. It wasnt as good as I thought it would be, but it shows potential. <br />The book is divided into four sections. The first section I found hilarious, especially the character known as The Luggage. But the following three sections seemed random and disconnected, as if the author had written them as short stories at different times and then decided to throw them together into a book. It almost felt like they were the results of a random adventure generator. These sections could have been put in any order and it wouldnt have made a difference. One even seems to take place after a slew of other events which were only briefly aluded to.<br />I missed the feel of an overall plot and purpose for the adventures, but the writing is good and amusing. Discworld is an interesting place and I think that as it is developed and the author gets into his stride they will improve.
0688163173|5.0|Fear, obsession, paranoia...Dennis Lehane's \\"Shutter Island\\" is the stuff nightmares are made of. It is noir psychological suspense at its finest.<br />An isolated island, a raging hurricane, a locked room, secret codes, a mental hospital, rumors of mysterious medical experiments frame the story.<br />It is a scary, deceptive, disorienting, complex story grounded in the reality of the times...cold war USA in 1954 (\\"I like Ike\\").<br />Mr. Lehane weaves many threads throughout the unpredictable plot. The set up is thorough and the characters are fully developed. The twists and turns play havoc with your mind.<br />The unexpected is the norm...a couple of times I was able to figure something out a page and a half before it was revealed, but that was rare. The ending is unguessable.<br />Immediately upon finishing, I reread the prolog and final chapter...and will read this book again. I have not been so dumbfounded by an ending since William Diehl's \\"Primal Fear.\\"<br />\\"Shutter Island\\" is etched in my memory.
B00008H2LB|4.0|As i read a through the reviews, it appeared to me that people either really like LP or they really hate them. i gave this CD 4 stars because there is always room for improvement. This is a very very good cd to me. to everyone hatin on LP.... why?? &quot;Well they sound the same as they did in Hybrid Theory&quot; dugh, These guys arent gonna change their style to bluegrass or jazz. If you can't sing along to &quot;from the inside&quot; &quot;figure .09&quot; or &quot;somewhere i belong&quot; what can you sing along to?? their songs have more that just vocals, guitar and drums, they all have a unique sound and thats what i like about LP. Obviously me and about 500,000,000 other people too because that about how many records they've sold and thats probably about how much each one's house is worth too so they MUST be doin something right.

B000002MFN|5.0|Of all Madonna's albums, this one is often regarded as her weakest. Actually, I'm still waiting to hear a weak album from Madonna and I hope I never do. Her appeal is partly that you never know what to expect next, and this is much mellower than her other albums. Perhaps that's why it is often overlooked.<br />All the songs are original, co-written by Madonna, except one. The album includes five international hits (about normal for Madonna) - they are Erotica, Fever, Deeper and deeper, Bad girl and rain. Fever is a cover of a song made famous by Peggy Lee, although Peggy's version was itself a cover. Madonna modernised Peggy's arrangement for the time in which she recorded it (1992) and makes a fine job of it. Actually, Madonna is in many ways a modern-day Peggy Lee. Both of them had careers spanning many years and continually adapted their music to changing fashions, without ever forgetting what they were best at.<br />The album sets its own mood and is ideal for late-night listening. There is much more to the songs than you might expect. In this life is about somebody dying of AIDS. Why's it so hard is a plea for respect - it could be about sexual equality, but the lyrics are open to interpretation, so it could just as easily be about racial equality or any other kind of equality.<br />This may not be the place to begin a collection of Madonna's music, but neither should it be left to last. It is one of many excellent albums recorded by Madonna. Enjoy it.
0345404475|5.0|I avoided reading this book for quite a while; in fact, I thought I would never read it in my lifetime. But one evening as I browsed around in the bookstore, I picked it up and began skimming the first page. <br /> Twenty minutes later when the clerk announced over the intercom that the store was closing, I had to tear myself away from it. The next day I came right back and bought it.<br /> I've always been a huge fan of the \\"Blade Runner\\" movie, and I've read quite a bit about the movie and how it was adapted from the book. Knowing that basically only the names of the characters and the basic premise were the same, I didn't like what I heard about the novel and how it differed from the fantastic world that Ridley Scott created for the big screen.<BR> <BR> But after reading just the first few pages that evening in the bookstore, I was hooked.<br /> If you are a fan of the \\"Blade Runner\\" movie, you absolutely can't go into this novel wanting to read about the characters and events in the movie. If you do, you will be disappointed. For all intensive purposes, it is an entirely different story. However, you will experience deja vu during certain sequences, such as the Voigt-Kampff  test with Rachael. Much of the dialogue is identical, but the differences in the story line make the scene fresh and exciting.<br /> On the other hand, if you hated the \\"Blade Runner\\" movie, don't turn away from this book either. As I said, the two are practically two different stories.<br /> \\"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep\\" is essentially the story of a man, Rick Deckard, who is stuck on a war-ravaged Earth because of his job and his lack of money to move off world. He is unhappy with his life, what he has accomplished, where he's headed, and what other people think about him. <br /> His largest agony is, in this world where real animals are a rarity, extremely expensive, and a status symbol, he can't afford a real sheep. He has to make do with an inferior electric sheep whose inanimate quality must be kept secret from the neighbors lest they think less of him. Deckard soon becomes obsessed with buying a real animal and will do almost anything to possess one. <br /> When Deckard has a chance to make extra money at his job of killing androids, he jumps at the chance. This will allow him to buy a real animal after all. However, throughout the events in the novel, we see that Deckard is really on a quest to give his life meaning and to find out who he really is.<br /> Filled with detail and amazing creativity, Philip K. Dick's Earth is indeed strange but believable. Dick has a talent for making the absurd seem ordinary, for merging an idea with a human element. It isn't the story or the science fiction or the plot twists that keep you reading (although they are intriguing) - it's the connection you feel with Deckard. You care about Deckard and want to know what happens to him. You relate to him, struggle with him, feel pity for him, and hope desperately that he will find what he is looking for.<br /> Even though \\"Androids\\" is extremely readable and enjoyable, there is much more going on in this short novel than meets the eye. It says a lot about human nature and human desire. The issues are serious and important: global destruction, endangered species, nuclear war, technology, social status, empathy...but overall, it questions the humanness in us all.
B00008S2VG|5.0|I'm a huge fan of Madonna, and all of albums have been excellent, but this album is one of the very best ever. This album is written and produced very good, and the lyrics are so amazing. So many songs make you start thinking about life &amp; what it's really like. It just really gets you flowing creatively. Madonna did what she does best her very best with her latest effort &quot;American Life&quot;. After listening you feel like you know her, because you learn about everything she's experienced in the spotlight &amp; how it's not as pretty as it all seems. All the songs are 5 stars &amp; there are absolutely no filler tracks on here. But my favorites so far if I had to say would be &quot;American Life&quot;, &quot;Hollywood&quot;, &quot;Nothing Fails&quot;, &quot;Intervention&quot;, &quot;X-Static Process&quot;, and &quot;Easy Ride&quot;. But the album is so wonderful as a whole &amp; you will want to put it on repeat and let it play over and over again. Just really brilliant!
B00008DDXC|5.0|Fantastic Movie! I think it was better than the first. I also think that the movies are better than the books, even though I prefer reading to watching a movie. You must buy this movie and watch it again and again. The Harry Potter series is truly magical. A must see!

This is so bad, I just can't understand why everyone likes them so much. It's ridiculous....but that doesn't compensate for the terribleness of this waste of a fine cd. Absolute garbage, stay away from it.
B00008BXJF|5.0|I've been listening to King Crimson a bit over the past year or so, but I wouldn't really have called myself a &quot;fan&quot; of theirs until I heard &quot;The Power To Believe.&quot;  I certainly haven't heard their entire catalogue, but this one would have to go at the top of what I HAVE heard.  It's got all the complexity and grandiose musicianship of albums like &quot;In The Court Of The Crimson King&quot; and &quot;Red,&quot; but with the power and volume turned WAY up.  Even more importantly, &quot;The Power To Believe&quot; offers up a diverse batch of intriguing songs.  At turns it's placid, heavy, and intricate, but the creativity and virtuosity of the band members ensure that it's always interesting.<br />If there's a problem with this album, it's that it reaches its high point too early with the stunning instrumental &quot;Level Five.&quot;  It's pretty rare for an instrumental to keep my attention all the way through, but this one accomplishes the feat quite easily, even at a length of over seven minutes.  Even as a longtime metal fan, I've never heard an instrumental that sounds as flat-out HEAVY as &quot;Level Five&quot; does.  If the guys wanted to demonstrate right off the bat just how well they can play, they picked a good song to do it.<br />The great songs come fast and often after the opener.  &quot;Eyes Wide Open&quot; turns the volume way down, but it has a trippy, Pink Floyd-ish vibe that makes it mesmerizing.  &quot;Elektrik&quot; is another woozy, noodling instrumental that actually manages to be every bit as good as &quot;Level Five&quot; is, thanks largely to Trey Gunn's rumbling basslines.  &quot;The Facts Of Life&quot; has a somewhat dirty, sinister sound to it, making it probably the most aggressive song here.  Adrian Bellew's vocals are practically growled, Fripp's guitar work is dark and distorted, and Pat Mastelotto's drumming is thunderous.<br />Oh, and then there's the monstrous rocker &quot;Happy With What You Have To Be Happy With.&quot;  The first time I heard this song, I wound up lying on the floor of my room, twitching from pleasure overload.  For those of you who have never banged your head to a King Crimson song before, this one just may change that.  Everything about this song is heavy: the guitars, the bass, the drums (especially the drums), the vocals, even the lyrical content.  Bellew's vocals are far more vitriolic than any I've heard from the band's older vocalists, and I mean that in the best possible way.  And ironically, while &quot;Happy With What You Have To Be Happy With&quot; criticizes modern bands for writing songs with predictable verse-chorus structures, Bellew's &quot;Were gonna have to have a chorus!&quot; mantra actually makes for one of the catchiest choruses I've ever heard.<br />While I know the year is young, &quot;The Power To Believe&quot; is certainly going to get some consideration for my prestigious &quot;Album of the Year&quot; honor.  Not to mention, it's going to make me delve into King Crimson's catalog a bit deeper.  If you're looking for a real alternative to the mainstream, this is a good place to start.  These guys rule.py With.&quot;  The first time I heard this song, I wound up lying on the floor of my room, twitching from pleasure overload.

B000069CWE|2.0|Another garaunteed multi million selling cd for mega money conglomerate Money Park. They should feel ashamed of themselves taking advantage of their poor fans like they do. They know the kids will eat it up no matter what kind of unlistenable trash it is, so they release it to scam a little cash on the side. Tsk Tsk Tsk. I actually enjoy Meteora and Hybrid Theory, despite the fact that they are a tad overrated, Linkin Park is a good band. Just stay away from reanimation, it's really not worth it. The only reason it got TWO stars is because Steve from Taproot is on it, but not even he can save this garbage.
B00008NRI8|2.0|Nothing worth seeing-- Grant has made some classics in this genre (Four Weddings and a Funeral, Notting Hill, Bridget Jones's Diary)-- but &quot;Two Weeks Notice&quot; is not a classic.  It isn't even an admirable effort.  It is clear he enjoyed working with Sandra Bullock offscreen, but they share little onscreen chemistry. Bullock continues her title as the &quot;poor man's Julia Roberts&quot; -- it's not a harmful film-- it's just not very good.

037542217X|5.0|As Westerners know, the confrontations between men and women are often acrimonious. Many books, with positions ranging from the militant to the yielding, have been written on the subject.  But this small novel, &quot;The Kalahari Typing School for Men&quot;, gently and quietly explores the relationships between men and women, and wisely and quietly illustrates the virtues of respect and patience as people learn to live together.<br />Yes, this is a 'detective' novel, and it's also a folk tale, an allegory, and a spiritual journey for all of the characters--and the reader.  The heroine, Precious Ramotswe, returns in The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency Series to confront a number of problems: a client who needs to make amends to important women in his life, an adopted son who is reaching puberty, a fiance who is fragile but growing stronger, an assistant who wants a man and finds one, and competition for her business with an obnoixious male detective.<br />But Precious is a well-rounded lady in her late thirties who possesses wisdom, maturity, and directness and sensibility. In less than 200 pages of this deceptively simple and exquisitely crafted novel, the problems are solved and--yes--the men learn to type.<br />The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency Series is a wonderful one. It is set in Botswana, where people mend tea cups rather than throw them away, the simplicity and dignity of the lifestyle is in itself a lesson.
B000002U6E|5.0|Enigma's The Cross of Changes journey's into the spiritual mix of ancient haunting Celtic harmonies and Native American chants. Songs that stand out on the album are 'Return to Innocence,' 'Silent Warrior' and 'Age of Loneliness.' 'Age of Lonliness' referred to as 'Carly's Song' is the track song from the movie &quot;Sliver.&quot; The lyrics and instrumentals are enchanting and rich in sound. It's a beautiful blend of two different tribal groups coming together to create a exquisite masterpiece of primitive music and gothic poetry. This is one of the best in World Dance genre along side Delerium and B-Tribe. It would be great for traveling music while driving in your car. It's entrancing you'll be at your destination in no time.
B00005JLEU|5.0|Miyazaki I believe is one of those multidimensional, multitalented people who create through inspiration, not just through experience (like Porco Rosso says).  Every time I see this film I find something new.  There are layers and layers of meaning that surpass by leaps and bounds any presented by transparent Disney films.  One example is with Chihiro's name.  Yubaba steals Chihiro's name, essentially stealing who she is; the sorceress then renames Chihiro \\"Sen\\" for her bath house job.  How do people control others?  By making you forget who you really are and renaming you to suit their purposes.  Luckily, she manages to remember her name which in turn enables her to fulfil her purpose: to save her parents, to save Haku, to right her mistake in letting the No-Face into the bath house; in short to fulfil her responsibilities in the spirit world, and by extension, in life.<br />What a difference a short stint in a bath house can make in an adolescent girl; compare the listless, sulking Chihiro in the opening scenes with the Chihiro who faces Yubaba and nullifies her work contract at the bath house.  Miyazaki made this film for adolescent girls in the hopes of sending the message that life isn't just about make-up, clothes, and boy bands.  Given a name and a purpose, what can't anyone accomplish, whether it be Chihiro or Miyazaki?
B00004R99J|4.0|Disney's Masterpiece &quot;Pocahontas&quot; was a good movie but was often over-looked or given bad ratings, and I believe this is simply because it doesn't fall in with classic Disney features.  For example, the love story doesn't end happily.  <BR>However, I think the real determining factor of this movie is that it was next in line after &quot;The Lion King.&quot;  Who can live up to that movie?  No Disney feature since has done as well.<BR>I enjoyed &quot;Pocahontas&quot; and I would recommend the movie to anyone who's in for a good hour and a half of fun.  The songs are enjoyable, the characters are fun, and it's also interesting to see the stark contrast between the English settlers way of life and the indians way of life.

It was excellently put together and very well organized!  This album and 2000's Music are her best albums yet!  Probably because sheis no phony and expresses her thoughts and her feelings through her songs!  She is excellent and she deserves 5 stars and if you give her anythin lower, you do not know what MUSIC IS!!!!!!

My mother gave this VHS to my child as a birthday present.  We watch it at least once a week if not every day if my child could. The length of this musical is such that it keeps even really young children entertained for it's duration. My child now sings some of the songs and has asked her music teacher in school to get a copy. Thank you Mr. Webber and Mr. Rice.

I did enjoy the ending and will try to read the next one to see if it gets better now that she has a speck of common sense.
B00003CXE7|1.0|Historical hokum is what this movie is all about.  Crowe's character was made up along with the whole story.  Any man or woman that knows anything about Roman history should be offended by this movie.  I guess the producers and directors thought by showing you good costumes and battle scenes assumed they could trick you into not thinking for yourself. The sad part is they probably were successfull with a minute exception of viewers.The movies finale speaks for the entire film. A roman emperor doing battle with the gladiator in the colliseum. The absurdity of portraying something like this shows Hollywood's true arrogance. The real shame is that the same type of movie could have been just as or even more entertaining based on historical reality.

B000002UAO|5.0|Many years ago, working in the business office of a Girl Scout camp in the Berkshires, we listened to Rubber Soul at least six times a day.  After about four weeks of this, I commented to one of the guys I worked with, &quot;This album is the apogee of the Beatles approach to a pop song as a three-minute monologue, spoken (sung) in character.  Each song paints a character and his story,  unique and totally unrelated to any other song.&quot;  And he replied, &quot;Well, that's why they called it 'Rubber Soul'.&quot;  In retrospect, this was the very opposite of a &quot;concept&quot; pop album, which would be invented by the lads three years later.<br />Many years later I would learn that Felice and Boudleaux Bryant and Robert Browning worked that way, too.

B00008DDSA|5.0|James Spader is terrific as the lawyer but the real star is the newcomer Maggie Gyllenhaal. And its not just the steamy stuff or the unusual nature of the steamy stuff whick marks this actress in your mind with indelible ink. Gyllenhaal is simply irresistable as the \\"secretary\\" who is too riddled with anxiety to allow herself to live. Her anxiety gives her a strange awkward  kind of energy which just wins you over in scene after scene. She doesn't realize it but all her life she has been looking for someone to give her permission to live and when James Spader's character does just that she metamorphoses into her true and determined-to-have-her way self. The transformation is a two way street however and as this boss/secretary co-dependence blossoms into full blown love Spader also emerges from his self-imposed exile from his own feeling self. Its not your usual love story but thats just the point--each of us, the film says in its unapologetically and delighfully perverse way,  has to re-invent life to suit our needs. The sets are all painted in the most putrid comic book day-glo colors and yet we grow to accept this abnormality just as we grow to accept the abnormalities of the Gyllenhaal/Spader dynamic. I would argue the best scenes are Gyllenhaal's \\"soliloquy's\\" in her bedroom and bathroom. In these scenes we penetrate the depths of her very private world, including her fantasy life and it is not a dark world at all. There is  in her utter isolation from the normal channels of existence a rare kind of aloneness, rare because so complete,  but there is also a manic kind of self-celebration in it. This is one story of dysfunction that does not end in a normalizing cure. Quite the opposite, the rest of the world comes to accept Gyllenhaal and Spader on their terms. Certainly the best love story involving spanking I've ever seen. A feel good movie for the secretary (and audience) alike.
B00003CXTG|5.0|I think a lot of people out there have totally forgotten what a movie is for. ENTERTAINMENT! If you want 100% historically accurate, go watch a documentary on the history channel.<BR>For the most part, this movie is accurate. Sure, there might be some small details that are not perfect, but as a whole, it does a very good job of showing us what it was like on Dec 7th 1941 at Pearl Harbor.<BR>Some people also seem to expect and hope for extremely graphic, bloody, and gory scenes like Saving Private Ryan. Anyone with a brain has a pretty good idea what warfare can do to the fragile human body. The people in the movie were still dying. I personally didn't miss or need extremely graphic images to get the point across.<BR>The love story side of it... Ok, so what? I thought it was done well enough. Certainly at least as watchable as the love story in Titanic.<BR>I thought all the acting was quite good, especially John Voight as F.D.R.<BR>I think a lot of people haven't even seen this movie due to some of the lousy reviews it's received. Also, the rhetoric from people that may not have even seen the film certainly seems to influence many. See it for yourself and make up your own mind!
6305327041|4.0|You NEED this DVD.  While the name Quentin Tarantino was my original appeal to this movie, my favorite segment by far was \\"The Misbehavers\\" by director Robert Rodriguez (Desperado and Spy Kids).  In watching his segment, I literally went numb from laughing so hard.  I don't want to spoil the punch, but believe that for that 30 minute segment alone this is worth having.  Tarantino's bit \\"The Man From Hollywood\\" is also funny in a very Tarantinoesque fashion, but admittedly, it didn't amke me go numb, just [wet] myself.  The first segment of the movie is by far my least favorite, but I still enjoyed it to a point.  Overall, I believe the acting sells the movie.  Tim Roth, the main character, is absolutely brilliant.  Without his acting, his character would have merely told the story.  Instead, he makes the story.  Also, Antonio Banderas is great.  He seems to work well with Director Robert Rodriguez, and the two of them have really perfected his character.  Tarantino's own acting in his segment is my biggest complaint, but his stuff is so dialogue driven that as long as its comprehensible, it works.  In closing, I would have loved to see this movie become the start of a TV series.
B00008OLYN|4.0|As a longtime Opeth fan, I waited for Damnation with a mix of eager anticipation and waryness. Eagerness because it was new material from one of my favorite bands, while waryness because of Opeth's past tendencies when they tried their hand at 'lighter' music. I wondered what direction Opeth would take on Damnation, their first attempt at a full non-metal album (no riffs, no growls).<br />I have found Opeth's past attempts at lighter songs on their more recent albums to be a mixed bag of sorts. For the most part, I found the songs enjoyable, but not very enthralling when compared to the rest of the music. I feel much the same way about Damnation.<br />On Damnation, Opeth carry on in the vein of these songs, adding more vocals and keyboards/mellotron. The songs are better and more focused than most of Opeth's previous lighter work, but I find them to be lacking something. One of Opeth's strengths in the past has been their ablity to blend styles of music, and progress from light to heavy while still retaining an overall feel to a song. When they go all-light, they seem to lose most of their diversity and energy that gives their music its appeal (to me, at least). To be blunt, I find Damnation to be a little boring.<br />I was honestly hoping that Opeth would change direction on this album, and attempt to create something new and different. I even had the tiniest of hopes that they would try and include some of that amazing sound they had in their first two albums. Opeth seemed to toy with the idea of experimenting a little more on songs such as &quot;To Rid the Disease&quot;, but overall, they seemed content with playing it safe.<br />Damnation does have its moments, and the album is pleasant sounding and well-produced (thanks to the ever-talented Steven Wilson). The problem with Damnation is that it seems to be lacking one of the key ingredients to great music: inspiration. I think Opeth fans and newcomers alike will find Damnation to be an enjoyable album, but it won't go down in history as their greatest acheivement.it won't go down in history as their greatest acheivement.
B00008S2VG|5.0|American Life has to be without a shadow of a doubt one of the best albums ever.  We see a woman who has matured both professionally and spiritually.  All of the songs on the album are very uplifting and in some cases it makes you contemplate life.  People listening to this album will hear  an album very well put together and   soothing as well.  I can't belive some of the ignorance that I have read from some of these reviews.  Madonna never said that this was supposed to be a dancy album (which it actually is) and she never compared it to Ray of Light, so I don't understand how people could compare the two albums.  Madonna has always been number 1 for a huge percentage of her career.  I mean how many singers are no longer around making hits? Mariah Carey, Michael Jackson, Whitney Houston, just to name a few.  Buy the CD it's an unforgetable listening experience.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|First off, this is an excellent movie. The editing and cinematography is brilliant, and the soundtrack batters away at your emotions right along with the music. The movie's point will hit you hard, whether you want it to or not. <br />That aside, this movie is hell. To call it intense is the greatest understatement. The director creates for the audience four friends. We get to know them, we feel bad for them, we want for them to be happy and succeed. And then before our very eyes, he throws them into a hellish meat-grinder of emotional and physical destruction and violation, and drags the audience down right along with them. You will not forget the last 15 minutes. They will haunt your dreams. Just hearing the soundtrack at a few intense parts makes my stomach cringe with the memory. So be warned, this movie is not for the faint hearted. But despite this, it is a movie that everyone should see it at some point in their lives. <br />And kids, don't do drugs.
B00004YX39|5.0|This album is in my opinion the second-best of the original 1970's-era Steely Dan albums, second only to &quot;Aja&quot; (1977). The songs are great, and are a little more pop-oriented.<br />Loads of great complex keyboard playing, layers of R&amp;B-inspired vocal choruses, and a strong horn section makes this set a great pleasure to listen to. I think the real strength of Steely Dan is their talent as arrangers, and that talent is evident throughout this record. And as always, Roger Nichols' recording of these sessions is beautiful and virtually flawless. My only criticism of this record is that is has a slightly too electronic sound to the music that could either be stylistic  (it was 1980) or a product of the recording process itself. And unlike the &quot;Aja&quot; album, there are no epic extended tracks like &quot;Deacon Blues&quot; or &quot;Aja&quot;. Other than that, this is just as good.<br />Becker and Fagen had clearly hit their stride by this time and here had taken their fusion of Rock, Jazz, and pop about as far as they could go. I think the highlight songs here are &quot;Babylon Sister&quot;, &quot;Hey Nineteen&quot;, &quot;Glamour Profession&quot;,&quot;Gaucho&quot;, and &quot;Time Out of Mind&quot;. A great album all the way through. Buy this one along with &quot;Aja&quot; and you'll have in my opinion some of the best music recorded in the last 30 years.
0930289234|4.0|Moore used off-the-shelf characters for this summary of the superhero genre and because it is built from so much insider material and history it dates badly and is all but meaningless to people who aren't suckers for the superhero. The politics and Cold-War paranoia about nuclear holocaust dates the book badly, as does the pretense to philosophical explanations (like the less successful but still entertaining The Killing Joke).<br />Moore's desire to make a profound statement about the human condition (see Joke) can supplant his ability to write convincing characters, leading to plot developments that just don't justify themselves and long speeches from characters who seem to be ciphers for ideology. On the other hand, the characters are written so well in Watchmen that absurdities of plot and political polemic are mostly forgivable.

B00000K19E|5.0|I would suggest that anyone (especially the previous reviewer) who thinks the concept of reality/unreality is an &quot;easy concept&quot; please read Decartes Meditation I-VI.<br />BTW, I thought the Matrix was/is a great movie for anyone who likes a little thinking with their summer blockbuster. It's the best Sci-fi/action/conceptial film that I've seen, period. I'm really not one to rush out and see a film when it initally opens, but The Matrix Reloaded will see me breaking that pattern.
B00005BL2A|3.0|Depeche Mode have consistently been, during the past 15 years, a band that has continued to evolve and progress.  I am of the camp that every album released from Black Celebration through Ultra is fantastic, and shows a band that is committed to staying musically and lyrically stimlating for listeners.<br />Unfortunately, i can't say the same thing about their most recent release, Exciter.  Musically and production-wise, this is the worst DM have sounded since Some Great Reward (1984).  Which is not to knock the songwriting of Martin Gore, which remains top notch.  I would rank songs such as Dream On, Freelove, Shine, Breathe, and I Am You as among the best of their career.  However, this album suffers tremendously from the production, or lack thereof.<br />And before i get slapped with a half dozen not-helpful reviews by DM die-hards, let me state that I understand where the band is trying to go with the quieter, heavily electronic approach.  I think they did a masterful job of it on Ultra.  However, musically speaking, Ultra was a significantly more interesting album than Exciter is.  Any semblance of solid percussion sounds and bass grooves have been replaced with clicks, bleeps, taps, and other assortments of electronic noises.  Songs like When the Body Speaks and Comatose have practically no percussion at all, whereas soings such as Dead of Night and I Am You, which would benefit greatly from a solid rhythm track, are unfortunately sorely lacking in that department.  <br />My biggest complaint with Exciter is that it seems as if DM are simply going through the motions at this point.  Yes, a lot of the songs are very good, and when played on the Exciter tour with different instrumentation and orchestrations, they sounded much fuller and, consequently, better.  But Exciter, the album, sounds like a band who has grown tired of being inventive and progressive, and who seems content on releasing material that sounds as if it could have been released 15 years ago.  Ican only hope on the next album that DM place more stock in the production (and producer) of the album, and once again create an album I can listen to straight through without dozing off.
B00005BJ2O|5.0|I got this cd a few days ago and since I put it in my cd player haven't taken it out except to put it in whatever room I'm in so I can listen to it in there too. It is simply my absolute favorite cd!!!! It's great to dance and sing along to. My favorite songs are all the ones in which Ewan McGregor and/or Nicole Kidman sing. They have incredibly wonderful voices. I LOVE El Tango de Roxanne, Elephant Love Medley, Your Song, Sparkling Diamonds, Nature Boy, and Complainte de la Butte. The rest of the songs are also really good, but those I just can't stop listening to. The Tango has such raw emotion, and the Love Medley is so fun to sing along with. Sparkling Diamonds is great, both the regular and the Hindu version. I can't even describe how great this CD is!!! I totally recommend everyone to own it!
B000002H33|5.0|I bought this when i was 9 and i scared me for life in a good way. This has to be one of my top 5 cds of all time. I can just pop it in and push shuffle and listen to all 55 minutes of pure mayhem and be at peice. I love how metallica can start slow like in Battery and Damage Inc. and just take off into pure craziness. And also the lyrics of war, drugs, and just the hard side of life are some of the greatest of all times. Here are my ratings of the tracks...<br /> Battery: I think this is the perfect choice for a opening track. It tells you what is to come later in the cd with the nice slow beginning and the kick a** tempo change after. And beleive me there are a lot of tempo changes in this cd.9/10 <br /> Master of Puppets: This is Metallica at its best. This title track is one of my favorite songs ever...i cant listen to this <BR>cd without listening to this song at least one time. 10/10<br /> The Thing That Should Not Be: Well its not one of my favorites but i will still give it a listen every once in a while...still a damn good song but just not one of my favorites. 6.5/10<br /> Welcome Home (Sanitarium): Now this is a bada** song right here. Its not quite a ballad but not quite thrash so I'm not sure how to label it. Great song what else can i say...8.9/10<br /> Disposable Heroes: One of my favorite songs on the cd. I dont like the length of the song because i just dont want it to end. All the lyrics and guitar riffs and solos are just perfect to me. 10/10<br /> Leper Messiah: Dude bow to Metallica...Damn good song but could have been a little bit faster. But i still like the beat and its a good listen. 8/10<br /> Orion: Great song but no Call of Klutu. Klutu beats Orion by about .5 for best Metallica instrumental ever...9/10<br /> Damage INC: A little bit to slow in the beginning but makes up for it when the tempo changes. Good drum beats and lyrics and one of my favorites on the cd... 9/10 <br /> Well Ive done my damage and cant wait till St.Anger comes out...they better go back to there roots...Metallica Rules!...
0743455967|5.0|Among modern literature, far and awat the liveliest genres are science-fiction and horror-fiction -- and of the two, the literature of horror, AKA horror &amp; supernatural fiction, is the most robust and vital of the two.  The best of those who write horror fiction are often well-represented in other genres, as well -- Stephen King is perhaps the most outstanding modern American representative of this phenomenon.  His autobiographical ON WRITING, which offers an outstanding window on his many talents, also gives the reader glimpses into the author's soul that are almost painfully honest, entirely lacking in the sort of self-serving vanity that is usually all too evident in most popular autobiographical works available today.  Like his fiction, which is at least as much concerned with &quot;cosmic wonder&quot; in a post-Lovecraftian sense as it is with horror, ON WRITING is a riveting read, an archetypal example of King's work in particular and that of horror writers in general.  Someone asked me, awhile back, &quot;Why the hell do you read this stuff, anyway?  Why not a nice Barbara Courtland novel or something?&quot;, referring to the work of King and his colleagues, in particular King's ON WRITING.  To paraphrase, W. B. Yeats, it is because &quot;[t]hey have words that can pierce the heart / And what can [the others] do but touch?&quot;  To my mind, there's no other good reason to prefer one author over any other.
0684833395|5.0|Catch-22 was an extremely well-written novel taking place during World War II. The author, Joseph Heller, made full use of his extraordinary wit. The whole novel takes on a light view, looking into an American military camp in Italy. The story is superbly set up as a camp of foolish bombardiers headed by egotistical power- and glory-hungry generals. <br />The story shifts from character to character, spending only a few pages on each. As the story progresses, previously introduced characters come in contact with each other, setting up the plot. <br />Heller wrote the book ten years after the war was over, but he still was able to grasp the general ideas of a military camp. Heller realized though that his novel was going to be much too serious if he kept it completely factual, so he changed a few details, which altered the novel from being serious to funny. <br />Although Heller changed the idea of a camp somewhat, he was still able to write an extremely funny novel. His wit provided an amusing storyline that no other book from World War II has, making Catch-22 truly one-of-a-kind.
B00005YW4H|1.0|This cd is boring.I listened to it.I WOULD NOT BUY IT.Save your money.Buy the VERY BEST OF CHER or BROADWAY MY WAY-LINDA EDER CD.<BR>CHER cds and LINDA EDER CDS are 100 times better.You wont be sorry.
0679805273|5.0|If you have other Dr. Seuss books then this one is a little different. It does not go into it's own story, instead it is written more like an introduction to the world of Dr. Seuss. It's all in there - from the Grinch of Whoville to Horton the Elephant to the Cat in the Hat. A great collection of characters all summed up in one little book.<br />Although I can stumble over pronouncing a word just like anyone else this book is very rhythmic and fun to read, it flows very well as do most other Dr. Seuss books. It is also every bit as silly and entertaining, even for me, as an adult.
B000002LGQ|5.0|This album is probably Madonna's most personal album (although American Life may take that title). Every time I hear that title song, which was deservedly a huge hit, I picture Madonna dancing in front of burning crosses. With the content of videos today, doesn't the controversy seem overblown? \\"Express Yourself\\"is antoher great song (my favorite line: \\"If the time isn't right then move on!\\"). Being a Prince fan, I like \\"Love Song\\" as well. \\"Til Death Do Us Part\\" also has a nice beat. \\"Promise To Try\\" is pretty and \\"Oh Father\\" is haunting. \\"Cherish\\" is the sweet and cute. \\"Keep It Together\\" is nice. \\"Spanish Eyes\\" is also haunting. \\"Act of Contrition\\" always freaks me out, an interesting way to end this album.  I love this album.  For those who think Madonna is a singles artist, listen to this album! Buy it today!
0156013983|5.0|This book is my all time favourite , a book which I had picked up and put down several times in the past. My mother read it to me , I read it to my children and even for myself.<br />Saint Exupery's classic tale can be read on many levels and enjoyed by readers of any age.  He tells the story of being stranded in the desert and meeting a tiny blond boy.  This Little Prince proceeds to tell of his travels from planet to planet until he arrived on Earth and of what he has learned along the way.  The most important thing he reveals is a secret that was taught him by a fox that he tamed.<br /> I saw what has kept this fable popular for so many years. I liked the  characters and the &quot;lessons.&quot; I was especially fond of the tippler and the businessman, and the poignant description of &quot;taming.&quot;  And, of course, there is the oft-quoted, &quot;It is only with the heart that one can see rightly; what is essential is invisible to the eye.&quot; Toward the end I began to feel that I was reading the New Testament but that is perhaps what will keep the fable in my consciousness: that and the marvelous pictures which I still find the best part of the book!
B000002MUW|5.0|Any apprehension I had about buying this album disappeared the minute I put it in my CD player.  I've always LOVED &quot;Secret&quot; and &quot;Take A Bow&quot;, and I wondered what the rest of the album held in store. I found the title to be very appropriate.  The overall feeling is very soothing, from the grooves of &quot;Survival&quot; to the beat of &quot;Secret&quot;.  Nearly every song on this album is cohesive and well-written. &quot;Inside of Me&quot; (about Madonna's mother!) is a very pretty, sad song.  &quot;Human Nature&quot; is even well integrated. I've always thought &quot;Bedtime Story&quot; was weird, but it fits when paired with &quot;Sanctuary&quot;. The album closes with &quot;Take A Bow&quot;, a beautiful song that is timeless, and understandably Madonna's biggest hit. If you are a Madonna fan and don't own this album, buy it now! You won't be dissapointed!
B00008S2VG|3.0|If it did, I would probably give Madonna's latest a 3.5 rating. \\"American Life\\" is more like a cross between \\"Music\\" and \\"Ray of Light\\", jockeying an uneven blend of electronica and pop.<br />The Material Girl's lyrics, especially on the title cut, \\"Hollywood\\", and \\"I'm So Stupid\\" are rather contradictory. How can one be critical of celebrity, as she seems to be when that is the very nature of her success? Is this more mature Madonna biting the proverbial hand that fed her so many years?<br />I hope not.<br />It appears that there are two camps of Madonna fans: those that think that she can do no wrong and those that try to psychoanalyze and scrutinize every aspect of the singer's character.<br />\\"American Idol\\" may be the first Madonna disc to satisfy both contingencies.
B00003CXXM|4.0|Movie is about an amnesiac CIA assassin who has no memory of his name, profession, or his recent activities. He pays a penniless German traveler to assist him in solving the puzzle of his missing identity and to find out why there are a group of assassins trying to dispose of him. The plotting is intricate with good character detail and good action mixed with slight humor. Having never read the original book, I viewed the movie with no real expectations. It kept me interested. Mystery, lots of action and an interesting twist at the end make this movie worth checking out.
B00008DDRX|4.0|I have reviewed this movie here already so I'll talk only about the DVD.  First, the video transfer is gorgeous!  Even though this movie is more than 30 years old, the colors are spectacular.  Either the DVD was made from a fresh print, or there was something done to the enhance the colors, but either way the film looks FABULOUS.  It actually looks better than many contemporary movies released on DVD.  Second, don't be misled by other reviews of this DVD--the soundtrack is not Dolby Surround (which is two channels of audio enhanced to three) but full Dolby Digital 5.1.  My only gripe here is that there is too much use of the center speaker.  This is only a small gripe, however.  If you have a 5.1 sound system, this movie sounds great CRANKED up.  The music is fresh and clear, and the roaring of that Porsche flat 12 gave me goose pimples.  As my other review mentioned, I saw this movie 7 times in the theater as a teenager, and I have watched it countless times on VHS tape since that was finally released.  I was surprised to find that watching it in widescreen (and it is quite wide) on a 53&quot; 16x9 television is a whole new experience.  The sensation of speed is much greater, and the beauty of the cinematography really stands out.  Many of the shots are just plain ruined on the tape version.  It really is a different experience on DVD.  Finally, there are no extras whatsoever on this DVD, and that is a shame because there are several outstanding documentaries on Steve McQueen and on the filming of &quot;Le Mans.&quot;  If you love this movie, you'll consider owning the DVD version a must.
B00008DDHZ|4.0|Excellent film. Wish movies like Pearl Harbor followed this style .
B00005YW4H|4.0|This CD has become popular because it is so different from the Britney Spears pop idol sound.  Not that it's anything completely unique, but it's jazzy sound is quite a refreshing break from the teeny-bopper music so often heard today.  It's also a quiet and soothing album, conducive to lulling one to sleep.
B00005ONMP|5.0|Set captures one of the premier recordings of Mendelssohn's symphonies and overtures, done by London Symphony Orchestra led by Claudio Abbado.<br />Included is a well interpreted version of the infamous &quot;A Midsummer Night's Dream&quot; which initially catapulted Mendelssohn to fame and continued to be a favorite, with its spellbinding imagery and mood.<br />Especially delightful in this set is the finale to the Scottish Symphony, with its delightful coda.  The Reformation Symphony is well interpreted here also with its vocal fugue type ending.<br />The Overtures provided are magnificent as well, highlighted by the excellent Overture for Wind Instruments and the infamous &quot;Calm Sea, Prosperous Voyage&quot; which became signatuatory for this composer around literary themes.<br />Excellent enjoyment of the breadth and depth of this prolific and versatile composer, from sacred to choral to operatic to the symphonic.
B00005JKN9|5.0|A long film, but without a doubt, the best movie of 2002-2003.  The screenplay, the direction, and the acting are top-notch.  I'm not a big Leonardo fan, but he definitely holds his own in this flick.  Daniel Day Lewis displays why he was nominated for Best Actor honors, and Cameron Diaz does a great job as well.<br />Some parts are a bit graphic, but it gives the true feel of that time and place during the mid 1800's...<br />Truly a masterpiece!
B00005JKPF|4.0|After being pleasently surprised by the first X-Men movie, I went to this one with the trepidation I have come to know from such sequels as `Blade II,' `Terminator 2,' and `Highlander 2.'  Usually after filmmakers have a hit with their first film (usually due to the amount of time invested in their scripts and actors over the amount of money in their special FX budget), they are heady with success by the second and chuck characterization and plot out the window in favor of boffo FX.  <br />I'm happy to type this is not the case with X2.  There is more of everything which worked for the first film - more characterization, more plot, more mutants, more film, more cameos (and nods to the fans - watch for Remy `Gambit' LeBeau's name on a computer screen and Hank `The Beast' McCoy being interviewed on Tv at a bar).  <br />The only thing I found lacking in this film was the presence of Sabretooth (while not a particularly memorable character in the first film, he DOES have a lot to do with Logan's past), and screen time for Cyclops.  However, what we do see of Cyclops is very well done, particularly in the performance of James Marsden, the man behind the visor.  In the five or ten minutes of time he has to emote throughout the film, he does a memorable job.  And did I miss it?  Where was Stan Lee's cameo?<br />But there's so much more to like in this movie than those minor quibbles.  I should mention the quality of this cast - particularly the supporting characters, as the main players showed their admirable talents in the first film and do no wrong in this one either (in the case of Halle Berry as Storm, there is an actual improvement).  Alan Cummings gives an affecting portrayal of Nightcrawler, a unique looking mutant with the ability to teleport.  Spirituality and faith, something usually sadly lacking today's movies gets a good representation in his character -a young man with the appearance of a devil and the heart of a saint.  On the other hand, we have Aaron Stanford giving an awesome show as Pyro, a slacker of a mutant with `something dangerous in him' and the ability to maniuplate fire.  Pyro is the raging youth given the power to enact his angst on the adult world - he swings from typical teenaged apathy to gleeful violence with the kind of believability Hayden Christian was sorely lacking in Star Wars 2.  Shawn Ashman as a likable Iceman plays as a polar (pun intended) opposite to Pyro - he's the well-adjusted son to Pyro's broken home kid (there's a great scene where Pyro looks at one of Iceman's family photos with longing - superb!).  Even the brief cameos by Jubilee, Shadowcat and others are memorable - evidence of great casting which I hope will be more utilized in X3.  Of particular note is Daniel Cudmore as Colossus, whose physical presence in the flesh is just as impressive as when he shifts to his armored skin.  With the one underplayed line `I can help,' he serves to establish his character as a benevolent protector.  One can only hope we'll see more of him next time.<br />The FX - something which is most often the downfall of a sequel (too many, usually) are used to great effect.  The escape of Magneto from his plastic prison is brilliant and exciting...the teleportation of Nightcrawler is well done (there's a nebulous, paint-in-the-water after effect that takes the BAMF! and smell of brimstone description of the comics to a new graphic level), and the escape of the children from the X-Mansion is great.  But where's the Danger Room?  I have full confidence in Synger's ability to pull that off in the next one...<br />Story-wise, the individual skeins of characters in the first film are nicely woven in the sequel, attaining new heights -most signifigantly with Jean Gray and Logan.  The better (or worse?) part of Logan's past is revealed, and there is a great arc in Jean Gray's progression as a character which elevates this beyond the status of a mere inbetweener and puts it on par with Empire Strikes Back, Star Trek 2, and Godfather II in the way of superb chapters.  I hope this isn't truly a trilogy, and that Synger and the fantastic group of filmmakers he has put together agree to more of these films, because I just don't see how ending the series in the next one could be satisfactory (but then, I didn't see how X2 could be good, either!).  I wish there was more time spent on Rogue and Iceman, and its my hope that Synger knows not to introduce too many more mutants, for the plot could become convoluted if he panders to too many hopeful fanboys.  In short, Colossus and The Beast, yes!  Gambit and Forge, no!  As much as I would like to see such characters on screen, they would work better as cameos.  Let's see the story of the X-men we have.   To wrap it up, its very rare nowadays that we see a franchise of such quality as X-Men - something which appeals to a mass audience, is approved of by die-hard fans, and yet has a deeper, important message as well (that of tolerance, love - both of the self and others, and basic goodness).  Bravo!
B00005JKPF|5.0|Good stuff all around here.  No, it's not Kurosawa or Lean or anything like that, but wow, that scene at the school . . . wow.  It got my blood flowing just as well as Braveheart or Gladiator did.  Be forewarned, however - every character gets a little bit of time in this one, and if you're walking into this one without having seen the first one and/or being unfamiliar with the X-Men universe, you might have trouble keeping tabs on who's who.<br />Very, very well done sequel with lots of excitement, stellar special effects, and some actual emotional resonance to the story.  A great ensemble cast, too, and it's great to see them give Mystique (Rebecca Romijn-Stamos) more screen time.  Kelly Hu seemed to be the only person with nothing to do.<br />Oh well, time to wait for the third one now.  I think we should call it \\"Rise, Phoenix, Rise.\\"
B0000065O1|5.0|I love this tape. Too bad it is out of print. I would suggest getting a used copy - that is what I did and it worked great if you are fearful of buying the used tapes. Cindy is wonderful to spend an hour with and she does all of the queing and explanation herself (you see very little of Radu). Unlike the last tape (which I also recommend) she has slowed down her moves so you get the most benefit. It includes a leg section which is comprised of lunges, kicks, squats, etc. Then you move onto the floor for abs and CHEST. The chest exercises are great because I haven't seen them in other tapes. That is followed by standing arms. I really enjoy this because you aren't doing the same exercises in sets. You move from one to the next with only one exercise repeated. It ends with a small ab section, back exercises and stretching. I consider myself an intermediate exerciser and this tape is challenging and never dull. It does run a little over an hour but you could end earlier if pressed for time. I highly recommend.
B00005JLSE|5.0|It's bawdy, bold, sassy, funny, loud, brash, gleeful, playful, cynical, jazzy, hotcha, buzzy, crazy, sexy, fun, angry, brawly, blowzy, floozy, doozy, woozy, stylish, puckish, coltish, brutish, busty, broady and lusty. Purrfect. <br />\\"Chicago\\" just breathes gusto. It's hard for people to get a handle on how much vavoom this movie has, how clever the adapatation is, how crafty the casting became. Renee Zellweger is a siamese cat of a discovery. Catherine Zeta-Jones busts her bustier good. Richard Gere earns his paycheck and makes a little time for some \\"hard workin man in showbiz\\" sympathy.<br />It all works. Every scene. It works just like the musical, maybe even better. The musical may have more oomph, more pent-up momentum. It may send a better raw chill through you. But the movie has more purr. And it has Renee Zellweger, a secret weapon who cannot take your eyes off of, even if she's isn't beautiful in the classic sense. You don't have to have drop dead looks to be a diva or an A-list Hollywood actress. You just have to have moxie, and Zellweger, and this movie, has moxie to burn.
1558908846|3.0|I have always known that Slyvester Stallone had limitations as an actor, but I have to admit I was rather surprised that he could not play Arnold Schwarzenegger.  Listen to the dialogue when the title character in \\"Judge Dredd\\" shows up on the scene and I think it is pretty clear that lines like \\"I am the law\\" were written for Ah-nold to growl rather than Sly.  I have no evidence to support such a conclusion, like we do for the part of the Wizard in The Wizard of Oz being written for W.C. Fields, but I remain convinced that Schwarzenegger would have been better suited to carrying off the opening scene.<br />Judge Dredd is based on a British comic book of a dystopian future where police officers have become judges who are judge, jury and executioner rolled into one.  As such it was part of the British disposition towards predicting a fascist future found in works from George Orwells classic novel 1984 to Alan Moore and David Lloyd comic book mini-series V for Vendetta.  For the most part the Judge Dredd comics were highlighted by the distinctive artwork of Brian Bolland more than anything else.<br />The film presents a future that is so violent, with Megacities engaged in constant battles called Block Wars, that even the Judges, with their authority and power to summarily execute criminals, are considered to be unable to handling the problem.  Judge Griffin (J&uuml;rgen Prochnow) wants to expand the authority of the Judges so that they can execute more criminals for lesser crimes and in a film like this you know such goals are not idle ideological discourse.  There is a conspiracy at work and suddenly Dredd (Stalone) is arrested and convicted for a crime that he did not commit.  The deed was perpetrated by Rico (Armand Assante), a former Judge who was sent to prison by Dredd.  But, as with all such movie conspiracies, there is much more to the plot than Dredd knows, involving even his father figure, Chief Justice Fargo (Max won Sydow).<br />Judge Dredd has two decidedly different sidekicks in this film, Judge Hershey (Diane Lane), who tries to defend him in court, and career petty criminal Herman Ferguson (Rob Schneider), who ends up with him on the street trying to stay alive and figure out the conspiracy.  They have relatively little to do in the film besides spout dialogue intended to provide exposition, comic relief, and chip away at Dredds gruff exterior to eventually find a spark of humanity.  It is a sad film that wastes the talents of both Diane Lane and Rob Schneider.  Judge Dredd works best during its action sequences, when the title character is too busy to speak, because sooner or later he utters the films wretched punch line, I knew youd say that, and you have to roll your eyes and wait for the next action sequence to distract you.<br />In its defense, it should be pointed out that there is a lot of action in the film, which never lets up long enough for you to make the conscious effort to stop watching.  The conspiracy is predictable enough that when characters sketch out the details in-between Dredd's rampages it is enough to connect the dots.  Just do not try and figure out the films ideological position on law and order issues in the real world.Sydow).  <br />Judge Dredd has two decidedly different sidekicks in this film, Judge Hershey (Diane Lane), who tries to defend him in court, and career petty criminal Herman Ferguson (Rob Schneider), who ends up with him on the street trying to stay alive and figure out the conspiracy.

B00005JKN9|3.0|\\"Gangs of New York\\" will sit amongst \\"Donnie Brasco\\" and \\"Casino\\" in the modern male film library, in the not-quite-great category. There are great things in this movie,\\" enough for some wishful critics to declare it one of the best films of the year. But the it's either too long or too short, depending on how you look at it; it's the kind of film, quite frankly, that should have been two films. As it is, the movie is 2 1/2 hours and it still feels painfully rushed. You can sense director Martin Scorsese wanting to linger, but feeling the pressure to keep his oversized story on the move. It just isn't quite the work the master's fully capable of -- it could be, in fact, one of his most uneven directions ever.<br />There is one incredible thing in the movie, and that is Daniel Day-Lewis, who swallows whole the character of Bill The Butcher, the criminal boss who runs the Five Points neighborhood in 1861 New York. Day-Lewis is a beast; he could stalk DeNiro's shadow any day of the week. Bill is a brilliant, emotionally ravaged monster -- a Jack the Ripper type, really -- with only his sense of honor and his enjoyment of power to stave off his enraged impulses; his moods are held together by the thinnest of threads. <br />Not so good is Leonardo DiCaprio, who simply lacks the toughs for a role like this. He looks like a model posing as a middle-of-the-century meany; on certain occasions, he rises to imbue his Amsterdam with shades of greatness, but not enough. You just can't buy the kid as a reasonable adversary to Bill. I'm not sure what young actor might have succeeded -- Colin Farrell, maybe? -- but DiCaprio is too much a movie star to ball up his fists convincingly. <br />Cameron Diaz, similarly, is miscast. Nope, not her in this movie, as a young pickpocket who must choose to stay loyal to Bill or love Amsterdam. Not enough fire. Diaz, at best, is emotionally unstable, a la \\"Vanilla Sky.\\" But gritty? Huh uh. Too much \\"prim\\" in her \\"prim-lookin star gazer.\\"<br />Scorsese tears the movie in too many directions. The final battle sequence is incredible, but a lot of viewers aren't really going to understand it. Scorsese never paints the broad strokes of a new America honing in on Five Points very well; a lot of people I saw the movie with thought the ending was a mistake. Actually, it's rather well-conceived thematically -- the government using the guns the gangs swore to keep at home -- and the images are outstanding, but its connections to the larger scope of the film remains on the page. Here we were, screwin around with all this gang nonsense, when all that was going on outside the Five Points? The ending is cool, but it feels like an intrusion we didn't want.<br />You see my point for two movies. The first, obviously would have ended with the first battle for the Five Points, which could have freed up the second movie to focus more on the growing America. As it is, jamming it all into one film, with some jarring edits, makes for an incomplete film experience; I fear \\"Gangs of New York\\" was slightly doomed in conception. it's a testament to the talent of the parties involved, especially Day-Lewis, that the movie nonetheless feels spectacular in parts.
B000002HH2|5.0|When and how did it happen?  When did a rock and roll purest like me get into Bjork.  For me, it started at the end.  While riding in a car with a buddy of mine I got my first taste of Bjork.  Vespertine had just come out (yeah, I started listening to her a little late, but better late than never) and I was love struck immediately after hearing the first few notes.  Bjork has opened a door for me into a hole new world of music that I did'nt know existed; or that I had just chosen to ignore.  Post is Bjork at her best.  Everytime I listen to this CD I take away something new that I had'nt noticed before.  It is a cure for the blues a shot of prozac a euphoric high that can't be explained.  It takes you on a trip and when it's over your glad you went.  If you like Bjork and for some reason you don't own this album buy it.  And if you have never listened to Bjork and want to start then this is the best place, but beware once you've made that leap there is no turning back.  She will open your eyes to a world you may not know existed.
B000002UDB|5.0|The only American release I like more than the British one, as five extra songs were added to the original EP. Those five songs fit perfectly and add considerably to this album.<br />People who genuinely like &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot; are usually considered weird, and much abuse was heaped upon me for loving this album. For awhile, it was my favorite Beatles.<br />This is the height of their lysergic experimentation, and contains some of the most unusual songs of their career. It starts off normally enough, but enters strange territory around &quot;Flying&quot;. George's &quot;Blue Jay Way&quot; has a great dirgelike quality to it, and exudes a Kafkaesque atmosphere of waiting. &quot;Your Mother Should Know&quot; is a little weak, but not too bad.<br />&quot;I am The Walrus&quot; is Lennon at his most imaginative, a great nonsense song. George Martin's loopy orchestration adds to the dementia. This really should've been an A side, instead of &quot;Hello Goodbye&quot;, an energetic ditty with a great coda.<br />Wow, what's next? &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot; (enough has been said about that one) and &quot;Penny Lane&quot;, Paul's ode to suburbia. There's a dark undertow to this song that belies its sunny exterior, as if the inhabitants of PL are dissatisfied with their supposedly happy existence. &quot;Baby You're a Rich Man&quot; has a great bumpity rhythm guitar and bass line part, with strange lyrics about money in zoos. It's been said this was about Brian Epstien.<br />&quot;All You Need is Love&quot; is a return to Lennon's more straightforward lyrical style. He says exactly what needs to be said with no extra padding. A perfectly suitable ending to a great EP made LP.
B00000JLWW|5.0|1997: We remember Titanic. The &quot;ship of dreams&quot; set sail from England to New York in 1912. It sank after striking an iceberg. Although many lost their lives, there were some survivors who recall with nostalgia, with sorrow, with a plethora of feelings and images the terrible disaster. One such woman is Gloria Stuart's character, Rose DeWitt Bucator. James Cameron directed a blockbuster, which earned him Best Picture and became the most popular film of the late 90's. And it all revolves around the elderly 100 plus Rose, remembering her lost love, Jack Dawson (Leonardo Dicaprio in his greatest and most memorable role). She says, &quot;He saved me, in every way a woman can be saved.&quot; Although it is Jack who loses his life, he has made it possible for the ill-at-ease Rose to break away from the gilded cage of her loveless engagement with Cal Hockley (Billy Zane) and the pretentious society he is part of.<br />This film on DVD is the theatrical experience all over again. We genuinely root for the perfect couple that Jack and Rose are, we dislike the villainous, self-centered Cal Hockley. The romance takes up most of the first half of the film, embellished with the luxury of the ship's upper class dinner halls and ballroom. Authentic period costumes of the Edwardian era enhance the characters and their way of life. For example, Rose is trapped in a world built solely on appearances, on subjugation of women to be ornaments on their husband's arm. The wealthy elitists on the ship are pretentious and hypocritical (one of the aristocrats is even flaunting his mistress while his wife is at home with the children). The exception is the newly rich Molly Brown (Kathy Bates) who came from a humble Ozark life to newly acquired fortune made by the discovery of oil-  these events are pretty much told in the musical &quot;Molly Brown&quot;, herself based on a true survivor of the ship. She was a pleasant, unpretentious, caring, humorous noble woman whose spirit was as they said &quot;unsinkable.&quot; Kathy Bates' portrayal of Molly Brown is quite enjoyable, as she seems to be the only noble and heroic and less hypocritical of the upper class people. Below deck, the lower classes are an earthy bunch, drinking beer, playing fiddles and trying to make the best of things.<br />We know what happens in the last half of the movie. Enhanced with striking, visceral effects and lots of water, the ship sinks in the middle of the Atlantic. Rose lives to tell her tale. The movie is a beautiful tale of survival, heartache and passion. Few films come that way. Nowadays, the love story between Jack and Rose may seem to sentimental and too unrealistic for some. But we know better.
B000002UAU|4.0|An interesting experiement that shows the Beatles at their most non-rockish (I consider them a pop band with a rock sensibility).<BR>However, I don't think they really went as far as they thought they would, as this whole album just sounds... unfinished. I also found my attention wandering during &quot;Within You Without You&quot; and &quot;When I'm 64&quot;, which are both a little boring to me.<br />Ringo sings &quot;With a Little Help&quot; in his best melancholy voice. John can sing like he's sneering at you, George can get preachy, and Paul can sound a little self-important, but Ringo always sings with warmth in his voice. He really shines on this one.<br />Lennon adds some great lyrical touches to &quot;She's Leaving Home&quot; which shows the parents perspective, and keeps the song from being too melodramatic.<br />&quot;Lovely Rita Meter Maid&quot; is a great little song, with an excellent intro and inventive melody. The horns make &quot;Good Morning Good Morning&quot; startling, and George adds some life to this album with his searing guitar solo.<br />&quot;A Day in the Life&quot; is brilliant, and the reason why I'm giving this album four stars instead of three. George sets the mood with a pensive and contemplative guitar intro, and Ringo adds some descriptive drum flourishes. John and Paul play off of each other's strengths to present a song containing two contrasting viewpoints of life: the man who sees something is wrong and wants to &quot;turn you on&quot;, and the man who just wants to get to work and get through the day. George Martin underlines all of this with his excellent orchestral score. This song is the ultimate example of all of the Beatles (Beatle #5 included) pooling their strenghts to produce a brilliant piece of work. <br />The rest of the album, though, doesn't quite live up to that level.
B000069HK2|5.0|Look.  You can complain about this band all you want.  You can say that they are unoriginal, you can say that they lack talent, you can say that they have a commercialized sound.  I dont care about any of that.  Here is what I know for sure: When I insert this CD and press play, I am amazed.  Every single time.  And for the record, I am not 12 years old, and I am not \\"goth\\" in any way shape or form.  I do not like MTV, and I am reasonably sure that kissing Kelly Osbourne has no direct effect on the way you can sing. I was not jumping on the bandwagon when I decided to pick up this cd. I picked it up because it rocks, plain and simple.
0060523794|5.0|I quite admire Louis Gerstner's courage to have taken up the challenge of rebuilding IBM. Indeed his account of the journey was quite detailed and educating for an aspiring CEO or a CEO who wants to take his company global.<br />His frankness about isues and his opinions I believe helped revive IBM. The section on Strategy and culture was quite educating for a CEO who wants to keep his company sane and the employees he reqiures. It is worthy of note though not all his decisions were the best around, but he was decisive and that is key for leadership.<br />Very Good book on Management and especially visionary leadership, though he belived more in strategy than vision!<br />I particularly liked what he said about Compaq! They bragged about revenue beating IBM after after they bought DIGITAL. Now compaq had to be swallowed by HP for what? Envy of IBM by HP or envy of Dell by Compaq!
B000069HK2|5.0|This band combines raw power with beautiful flowing melodies like nothing I have ever heard before.  Translation: I CANT STOP LISTENING TO THIS CD.  I'm not going to go into all the different songs, because they are all good. Listen. Just buy this one.  It's worth it.
0385335482|2.0|While I enjoyed certain aspects of this book, the thought that constantly hovered over me was, \\"this book is almost exactly the same as Bridget Jones's Diary!\\" Let's see, young single woman works a crappy job, has difficulty controlling various aspects of her life, is constantly lying and then getting caught in lies, hits rock bottom and then all of a sudden, quite miraculously by chance her whole life is turned around by a well-timed (and lucky) decision and simultaneously lands gorgeous millionaire....sound a bit like Bridget Jones? Yeah, I thought so too. The only difference is that BJD is so much funnier and more believable and more LIKEABLE. I can't see why this book was ever published. If you're in the market for a funny read go with Bridget Jones's Diary and the sequel, The Edge of Reason by Helen Fielding. Much, MUCH better.

B000089J0R|3.0|They describe their sound \\"as a mix of modern melodic power metal with the fury of speed metal...Catchy melodies that stick straight into your head, combined with outrageous speed, power and totally over the top dual guitar wizardry...enough hooks to fill an ocean, enough technical process to satisfy progressive metal lovers, guitar solos to have you playing air guitar. ...catchy melodies and the strong voice of an outstanding metal shouter.\\"<br />The description brought a smile to my face. \\"This image with the `all metal' black leather and well styled flowing locks (sadly I note no Vidal Sassoon hair products sponsorship) is to good to be true\\", I thought to myself. <br />Being an old closet `power metal' fan with forefathers `Manowar' and the likes of `Hammerfall' rating us a couple of my favourite acts, I ordered a copy of their debut release `Valley of the Damned'. <br />As you weave your way through the intro `Invocation of Apocalyptic Evil' it's a clear you've entered the realms of true power metal. Strap on the suit of armour people your in for a full frontal assault! Sam Totman (English/Kiwi) and Herman Li's (Hong Kong) guitar combination, speed through this multicultural army's debut release with melodic precision. The drumming of Frenchman Didier Almouzni and bass genius of ex member Diccon Harper (it's going to take big feet to fill these shoes!) compliment the keyboard work of Ukranian Vadim Pruzhanov perfectly. Last but not least the vocal range and power of South African ZP Theart is comparable to the best screamers out there. As you are pile driven through classics like `Black Winter Night', `Evening Star' and finally dismounting at `Heart of the Dragon' I am left nodding in agreement, the description in their biography is no exaggeration. The smile on my face is no longer one of cynicism but one of satisfaction and approval!<br />If there's any constructive criticism I have to say that the vocals sit too far back in the mix and the price is a littledear for only 8 tracks, not counting the intro.    <BR>All in all this is a release to get your hands on and an act to watch out for.<br />\\"HAIL DRAGONFORCE HAIL!\\"
B00008S2VG|5.0|Praise: After 20 years, Madonna continues to grow and develop as an artist. When most bands/singers have long since covered everything under the sun, Madonna continues to offer something new. She wrote all the songs, learned to play guitar and co-produced her own music. The subject matter seems deeply personal here such as \\"Mother and Father\\", \\"Nobody Knows Me\\", \\"I'm So Stupid\\" and \\"American Life\\". She continues to explore new musical sounds \\"Die Another Day\\", \\"I'm So Stupid\\", \\"Mother and Father\\". The fact that \\"American Life\\" entered the charts at number one is justified. This is her most consistent collection of songs since 1989's \\"Like A Prayer\\".<br />Criticism: Hmmm, well it took a number of listens for me to beging enjoying this disc. It really grew on me after the fourth or fifth time through. I could just as easily comment that Madonna is a conundrum. How can she sing about being stupid on \\"I'm So Stupid\\"? Does she expect us to believe that she is ready to give up looking good and staying in shape? That songs seems to suggest so. Does she expect us (hard working, underpaid types) to believe that she isn't satisified, that having wealth and fame is living hell?<br />Conclusion: This is exceptional work from Madonna, though it may take repeated listenings to realize this. At times I was struck by Madonna's hypocracy, but not enough to detract from her attempts at self-analysis and self-growth.
B00008H2LB|3.0|It's been two weeks and some that I picked up the follow up to the multi-million selling `Hybrid Theory'. With the demise of Nu-Metal the true believers of this genre of music have been patiently awaiting the latest release by the so-called BIGGEST BAND IN THE WORLD. With 17 million albums under their belt `Meteora' had to be a big one. With millions of dollars being pumped into the album and then some to create the marketing frenzy and finally the album is out.<br />Right off the bat as I listened to it in its entirety the first word to enter my mind is `clinical'. This is an album that is so clean and tidy that you can serve this up as a Pop record. In saying that so many genres of music have become blurred to the extent one does not know if its pop, rap, or rock these days.<br />The albums merrily skips along with one track blending into another with all it's precise guitar work, programmed drum tracks, clean vocals, the now so common sampling and clinical production. `Meteora' reflects a ensemble of tracks with a mere whiff of Metal on `Figure.09, as hip-hop as it can get on `Nobody's Listening' and `Session' and the lowlight of the album an awful Pop tune in `Numb'.<br />In summation this is a nice album, a friendly album, an album your neighbours will appreciate at 03h00, an album to have a meal to, to use as lift music. Perhaps it will grow on me like my appreciation for kidneys. Bring back the days of vinyl, of real recording with real instruments. The days of raw energy and passion reflected on a record where one savoured the little mistakes made...
B00008PW3Q|4.0|Praise: The return of Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks gives Fleetwood Mac new life. After the abysmal &quot;Time&quot; (1995) Fleetwood Mac are back in the game with &quot;Say You Will&quot;. It reminded me of &quot;Tusk&quot; in that &quot;Say You Will&quot; is, indeed, edgier than &quot;Behind The Mask&quot;, &quot;Tango In The Night&quot; and &quot;Mirage&quot;. &quot;Say You Will&quot; also offers nearly as many tracks as &quot;Tusk&quot;. There are many great performances divided between Buckingham and Nicks. Buckingham shines on &quot;Red Rover&quot; and &quot;Say Goodbye&quot;. Nicks sounds fantastic on &quot;Goodbye Baby&quot; and &quot;Running Through The Garden&quot;. There are some nice melodies like &quot;Thrown Down&quot;, &quot;Say You Will&quot;, &quot;Peacekeeper&quot; and &quot;Bleed To Love Her&quot;. There are inspired moments from the entire band on experimental works like &quot;Murrow Turning Over In His Grave&quot; and &quot;Come&quot;.<br />Criticism: Obviously, no Christine McVie. She is sorely missed here with her one of a kind voice and melodies. Why she couldn't have contributed five six songs is pure bafflement. Retired, indeed. There are a few duds like &quot;Illume&quot; and &quot;Destiny Rules&quot;. I don't know....I guess after 16 years away from Fleetwood Mac, I was expecting more from everyone.<br />Conclusion: With repeated listening the cd gets better and better. Fleetwood Mac isn't Fleetwood Mac with out Mick, John, Christine, Lindsey and Stevie. Comes close to being a dream comeback album, but misses somehow. If this is the last Fleetwood Mac album for the band, it's not a bad way to go out at all. Sure beats &quot;Time&quot; and &quot;Behind The Mask&quot;. I'm also pretty sure Fleetwood Mac fans will accept and like this disc (like me). Also, can us fans really expect another &quot;Rumours&quot;? It wouldn't be good for them to regurgitate the past now would it.
0385504209|4.0|I'm halfway through this and having a grand time.  Dan Brown is HARDLY the first one to come up with the idea that Christ fathered a child.  If you want stupid religious ... read The Omega Code.<br />The Da Vinci Code is fun, it is full of good tidbits and trivia, it's reasonably well written (the exceptions being some obvious ploys in the plot in order to be able to explain history).<br />It's hard to put down and a quick read.  If you like cryptography or fast-paced diversion it will entertain you.
B00005JKPF|5.0|This was the ultimate comic book movie.  It read and watched like an series of x-men issue.  Some highlights:<br />Wolverine addressing the mansion invasion his way.<br />The Escape of Magneto<br />The Jet battle<br />The villian's dupe who apparently is seeking his father's approval.<br />There isn't a bad bit of acting in the movie that I could see.  Our villians and hero's were awesome.  I also think the chemestry between Mystique and Wolverine will be worth playing off.<br />The introduction of both Colossus and Kitty without actually introducing them is a great idea.  The name stars such as Berry will likely not remain for the entire franchise so the missing characters played by young actors will set the stage for it to continue.<br />I saw this at the drive-in as a double feature with Daredevil (Yes there still ARE drive-ins in Massachusetts but not many) and my wife pointed out that both movies had sympathetic portrayals of Catholic characters, for X-Men this would be Nightcrawler, the willingness not to run from his faith or try to write it out of the script is a good thing and brave in the hollywood of today.<br />Wolverine is the guts of this franchise, and from what I saw he can carry this band for a long time.<br />The first movie was very good but the LOTR & Potter franchises which followed afterwards were SO far beyond it that it made the movie less satisfying.  This movie can stand toe to toe with them and like Gods and Generals makes the first movie better by its existance.<br />This will be a fun ride.  Take it.
B00006RIO7|5.0|Comparing with Moulin Rouse, Chicago is more powerful and fantastic. If you want to keep the impression you get when you see this movie, I strongly recommend this CD, Chicago.<br />Originally being a musical, this album Chicago is as vivid as a musical sound track. Thinking of disappointment that I feel when I listen to Moulin Rouse because of its weak vocals, Chicago is very impressive. Catherine Zeta Jones, Renee Zellweger and Richard Gere's singings are so admirable.<br />This album contains all the music you can hear in the movie, which makes you feel like watching it. Moreover, there are some other songs that you cannot hear when you see the movie: track # 17 performed by Queen Latifah and Lil&iexcl;¯kim and # 18 performed by Anastacia. These two tracks are somewhat inharmonious considering all the other songs based on jazz, but they&iexcl;¯re somewhat unique. For my part, my favorites are track #6 We Both Reached For the Gun and #14 Catherine Zeta-Jones and Renee Zellweger:I move on. These are both reminding of the movie Chicago and especially track # 14's words are really moving, with Jazz sound.<br />If you are someone who enjoys listening Jazz, this CD will be the best choice you can have. Not only are melodies great but also are their words so touching.<br />Great music!<br />&iexcl;°It is good, isn&iexcl;¯t it? Grand, isn&iexcl;¯t it? Swell, isn&iexcl;¯t it?&iexcl;±(from track #14)
B000050IKM|4.0|My baby loved this video from the time she was 2 months old
B00008CLOA|5.0|This is the masterpiece of one of the greatest rock bands in all history, Pink Floyd.  The Darkside of the Moon was such a groundbreaking album for the group and I view it as a work of art rather than just another CD in my collection.  I never really heard the full album of DSOTM before, I had only heard a bit in my sculpture class (where I was turned on to the magic of Floyd) and I borrowed the 2-disc set \\"Echoes\\" from my local library and was able to sample tracks from all their albums from 1967( A saucer full of secrets)-1994 (The Division Bell).  I thought I would buy this album because it's the most popular one and I enjoyed the selections from DSOTM that appeared on \\"Echoes\\".  In my opinion, the best tracks on DSOTM would be \\"The Great Gig In The Sky\\", \\"Money\\", and \\"Us and Them\\", but the album is best when listened to in it's entirety.  If you're new to Pink Floyd (like I am) or would like to add another version of this amazing album to your collection, I would reccommend purchasing The Darkside of the Moon.  It's a bargain at any price and you won't regret it. I plan on purchasing The Wall next as it is Pink Floyd's other best known work and I would like to hear as much as I can of this group because they're becoming rare as new groups emerge on the scene, but Floyd will never die.  Recently I heard a rumor that they might be coming to Cleveland to do a show.  That would be the chance of a lifetime.  Buy this album, Peace Out!
B00008J4P5|5.0|I have been a fan of the white stripes since their free concert in NYC.  The raw emotion and amazing connection between meg and jack was trully a site for th eyes and a treat for the ears.  Elephant takes my fav band to new heights and I reccomend the cd for those who want to eneter a world of wonderful chilled out music and to those who loved Whites earlier records.  Think amazing with a little extra something tucked in.
B00003CWPL|5.0|\\"Eraserhead\\" is the sickest, scariest, most depressing, bleak and funny movie ever made. (Check out the foreign release dates!  Five more years for UK release!)<br />I've been waiting for this since DVD's were first made; it's obvious Lynch had trouble getting it done.  The box is labeled \\"2000\\" despite it's 2003 release.  But the booklet & special features are excellent, as well as the packaging.
B00008S2VG|4.0|Despite the fact that most people believe Madonna's momentum is fading, I would like to say that this album is probably one of the best records out there right now.  So, Madonna used Mirwais again, the first time since Erotica that she used the same producer.  Well, fear not.  This is no &#34;Music 2&#34;.  The two singles released thus far (&#34;American Life&#34;, &#34;Die Another Day&#34;) are the only songs that feature the signature &#34;Mirwais sound&#34;.  The other 9 songs on this album sound fresh, innovative and alive unlike Mirwais' work on Music and his solo album, Production. Madonna has chosen on this record to tone down the overproduced, mega-electronic sound on the majority of the songs.  The result is a funky folky sound that surprisingly works extremely well.  Lush guitars with short, thumping beats accompany her on songs like &#34;Hollywood&#34;, &#34;Nothing Fails&#34;, &#34;Intervention&#34;, &#34;I'm So Stupid&#34;, &#34;Love Profusion&#34; and &#34;Easy Ride&#34;, while her only backup on &#34;X-Static Process&#34; is a lonely guitar and her own layered vocals.  If for no other reason, buy this record for the song &#34;Nothing Fails&#34;, which is by far the most beautiful song Madonna has ever composed.  It's choir finale is enough to make you want to burst with emotion.  The sweet &#34;Intervention&#34; is also worth the price of the record. The more techno tracks are quite astonishing as well.  &#34;American Life&#34;, which debuted with very mixed reviews, proves to be the weakest part of the album.  &#34;Nobody Knows Me&#34; is a track that should be receiving heavy plays in clubs.  &#34;Mother and Father&#34; is a catchy dance song whose accompanying rap is worlds better than in the title track.  &#34;Die Another Day&#34;, possibly the best Bond theme ever made, shines even brighter on this album than on the disappointing movie. Overall, this album is not as good as Ray of Light, but is infinitely better than Music.  One of its strongestpoints is the fact that it's her least radio-friendly album to date, making it sound like a true work of art that's free of the chains of Top 40 monotony.  This is not another collection of bubble-gum pop music.  This is a true album with a real theme and message.  And now a note about the quality of the vinyl pressing.  In a word, AWFUL.  It is, without a doubt, the sloppiest and worst-sounding record I have ever listened to.  The album is spread across two records.  The first one (side 1 and 2) contains the first six tracks and it's practically unplayable.  The music is mastered extremely loudly, and the high end is absolutely infested with sibilance.  Every time a musical element hits like a cymbal or snare (yes, I know it's all synthesized), or when Madonna pronounces the letter S, T, or the 'ch' or 'sh' sound, it sounds like it broken up or sizzling.  And since producer Mirwais loves to use sharp highs, you'll hear this a LOT.  Then, on to the second record (side 3 and 4).  This one requires that you set your record player to 45 rpm!  I've never seen a case where half the album plays at 33 while the other at 45.  However, the remaining 5 songs on the album sound much, MUCH better.  The volume level is noticeably lower and everything sounds crisp and clear.  So in essence, half the album sounds good, and half you can barely listen to.  I don't know if this is a defect (I sent it back and got a second copy...no difference), but I sincerely hope this isn't the norm with these reissues.
B00005JL96|3.0|I LOVED this movie. The story line was a little out there for Disney, but they did a good job with it. <br />The songs were great. <br />I wouldn't let little kids watch it though. There's a little too much violence in it.
0671027344|4.0|The life of the protagonist Charlie changes completely during his first year at high school. He makes new friends and with them he enters a new world of parties, sex and drugs. But actually he remains a wallflower and his over-sensitive character suffers from the problems of his family. <BR>Charlie also has his first experiences with girls: His love with Sam doesn't have a chance, because of differences in age, behaviour and thinking. He starts dating Mary Elizabeth, but it is not true love. <BR>In a play he decides to show his real feelings and hurts nearly all his friends. This event marks the turning point of the story, because you ask yourself if he remains together with Mary Elizabeth or if he comes together with Sam. <BR>The book consists of Charlie's letters to an unknown friend. By means of them you can imagine his feelings very good. <BR>However, you only look at each event through his eyeglasses. <BR>But on the whole we can recommend this very intimate book because of its tension and interesting report of growing-up.
0446677450|1.0|This book is one of the worst disappointments of any reading material I have come upon in the last century.  I bought this book hoping for wisdom which I assume would be revealed but instead I just got the same empty words over and over again and again and again.<br />I think that the only failing of Poor Dad was in the raising of a son who could have such little respect for his values that ultimately may have been missed by his son.<br />Maybe he is sincere, and out of him the benefit of the doubt, but I think I've been calmed and that this guy is making a fortune also selling books and claiming to be retired.<br />I even watched a full hour on national public television waiting for something, I got nothing.<br />Good luck
B00005JKPF|3.0|On the good side, I like that this movie takes up exactly where the other one leaves off.  Each of the Batman films feels like it is in a different universe (different actors, directors, art design, tone, etc.).  The two X-Men movies could be spliced together to form the X-Men Saga.  <br />Nightcrawler is great - we believe it when he \\"BAMPHS.\\"  For those of us familiar with the comic books, we get the beginning of the Phoenix Saga here, which will undoubtedly be played out in future films.  There are great special effects, great fight scenes, and the overall tone of the movie is true to the comics.<br />On the flip side, even though more X-Men are introduced, they don't have that much to do.  Iceman has always been one of my favorite characters.  He plays a large part in this film, but he never really has a chance to let his awesome power loose.  NOT ONCE DOES HIS SKIN FREEZE OVER!  Colossus is here too, but he is young - he only has one scene.  Surely Colossus would be an invaluable asset.<br />I am most sad about Magneto.  Magneto has always been one of my favorite characters.  He's more than just a villain.  There is a chance in this film for him to become the Magneto who would lead The New Mutants.  Unfortunately, his hero moment passes, and they let this complex character degenerate into just \\"the villain.\\"
0783233477|1.0|I can't believe I wasted 2 1/2 hours of my life on this movie.  It has as much excitement as Fat Free Bread.  I'm afraid to watch the orignial version called Death Takes a Vacation.  <BR>Aside from the drawn out, extremeley uneventful plot was the obvious hidden meaning.  Wealthy people are more special than the rest of us, and when they die it is tragic but when normal people die, it is no big deal.  You'll understand what I mean if you don't listen to me and watch this movie anyways.  Brad Pitt gets hit by a car in the beginning of the film.  No big deal...life moves on, but when old rich man dies, there is drama and tragedy.  I don't know about everyone else but I hate rich snobs and I if I knew this movie was dedicated to about how much better they are than me I would have never watched it to begin with.  <BR>Oh, don't forget the part about how death has been around since the beginning of time and knows english and table manners but has no clue about peanut butter and other simple things.  Whatever.....
B00007BH3Y|5.0|on his Orange Mountain Music label, available only from amazon.com.  If you like \\"THE HOURS\\" soundtrack, you'll like \\"THE THIN BLUE LINE\\" as well.<br />\\"THE HOURS\\" was a good film which I enjoyed, but not something you could watch over and over again, or you may find yourself jumping off a bridge.  However, the soundtrack is something you can enjoy every day.  The soundtrack substantially improved the film.  Even though the subject matter of the film was dark, there are a lot of glimpses of light and hope in Glass's score.  It should have won the Oscar Award for best soundtrack as it was a critical part of the film, so much so that the music was like another character in the film.  People who thought the music was too intrusive in the film don't know what they're talking about.<br />Listening to the soundtrack CD, the music of THE HOURS proves to be remarkably understated, controlled, polished, and not overbearing in any way.  Written primarily for 50 violins and solo piano, Glass weaves a beautiful tapestry that will spellbind you.  <br />THE HOURS is also a great piece to begin your Philip Glass journey with- it's not as intense and hair-raising as a lot of his other works.  A lot of the reviewers of the CD here on amazon.com seem to be new Philip Glass listeners.  THE HOURS is a great piece, but if you are curious as to what Glass can really do- try out pieces like A DESCENT INTO THE MAELSTROM, THE PHOTOGRAPHER, KOYAANISQATSI, POWAQQATSI, NAQOYQATSI, and SYMPHONY NO. 5 just for starters!  Glass rules!
B000001Y2U|5.0|What can I say?  I love this guy and I love this album.  He has a strong voice, an incredible presence, and the lyrics and music are absolutely outstanding.<br />My favorite song on this album is Tourniquet.  It's a dark, erotic piece which, like the rest of this incredible album, has intoxicating lyrics, a strong rhythm and is definitely Manson at his best.  <br />In a nutshell, the man is a genius.

0684833395|4.0|Critique      Christopher Grant<br />     Yossarian of the story, \\"Catch-22,\\" is finally free from the hell that is war. He runs away from his hellish experiences during World War II. In the minds of narrow minded readers Yossarian is a coward, escapist, and selfish for his desertion. These readers do not take into consideration how selfless his desertion really was.<br />     Yossarian is presented with a catch by Colonel Cathcart when he offers Yossarian a chance to go home in return for a favor, a favor that will take many innocent lives. Yossarian is set. He can finally leave the god forsaken war that has taken the lives of so many of his friends. Colonel Cathcart tells him he will include a promotion and, \\"have parades in his honor.\\" Colonel Cathcart says Yossarian would have to be a fool to turn down the agreement. But Yossarian doesn't go through with it and decides to run away instead, saving the lives of many innocent people. Yossarian now presents himself with a bad situation. He puts himself in danger of getting a court martial, sent to prison, and as Major Danby put it to, \\"live in danger of betrayal forever.\\" Yossarian's brave and selfless actions are continuously shown to us when he considers the lives of those who will be affected if he is sent home by Cathcart.<br />     Yossarian would be a true escapist if he allowed Cathcart to send him home a hero. If Yossarian chose to go home, the other men in the squadron would unknowingly have to complete more missions than they really need to. But if he stayed, and didn't fly any more missions, the other men in the squadron would have refused to fly missions as well breaking up the unit and putting the country at risk. In this, Yossarian is now sacrificing his safety for the lives of the men in the squadron and the good of the country. Yossarian's selfless actions have still yet to cease. <br />     Yossarian continues to think of the well being of others. He says to Major Danby, \\"there's a young kid in Romewhose life I'd like to save if I can find her.\\"   Nately's whore and her younger sister have been kicked out of their apartment in Rome. Yossarian's selfless actions continue when he decides to save (putting himself in danger) the little girl from the dangers of the Eternal City. Yossarian's actions here prove to be anything but selfish. <br />     How could such a brave man like Yossarian be branded a coward, escapist, and selfish? His reasoning for desertion was based on how it would affect the lives of everyone else in the war. Yossarian would have been a coward to get sent home with a promotion and parade, an escapist if he ignored the lives of the men who fly the missions, and selfish to consider his life over the one of a helpless little girl. Before a narrow minded reader brands the selfless actions of a hero like Yossarian to be cowardly, an escapist, or selfish, they should look at the facts.
B00000IN5G|5.0|Wow. This is one of the best albums i have ever heard. When my friend showed me COB, i first listened to Bed of Razors, and that has become my favorite song ever since. Each song is heavy and loaded with doublebass, and amazing guitar and keyboard solos. There aren't that many songs, but each song is pretty long, and they are all great. Nice dark lyrics. This is definately the best COB album there is. I brought this cd once, and my friend accidentally broke it, so i bought it again later that day. That is how good this cd is. The only song i don't like on this album is...NONE OF THEM!! Every song is great and you will want to listen to them voer and over again. My favorite song is Bed of Razors, but also dont forget to check out Towards Dead End, Downfall, Black Widow, Children of Bodom, Wrath Within, and Silent Night Bodom Night. You know what? Just listen to each song and you will se how great they all are.
B00005JKPF|5.0|Summary: \\"X\\"cellent film-X2 exceeds the original film and instills hope in the x-men movie franchise\\"<BR>The second installment in the X-men saga delivers everything a moviegoer could ask for. Nonstop action, character driven pathos, resolution of plot threads, new questions raised, and cameos and suprises all along the way. X-Men and Comic book fans alike, will be proud that their favorite heroes have put their best face forward. The film's action unfolds within minutes of the opening credits and takes you along for a ride you'll remember long after the last scene in the film. The nature of a sequel, and its expectations notwithstanding, the film could be seen as a standalone. A moviegoer who has seen the original film will marvel at how the films tie so well together as plot threads in the first film get resolved, and new plotlines open up for future films. The film has done a great job to solidify the franchise and continue a new genre of comic related films. From a comic fan's standpoint the film does a very good job of keeping the feel of the comic translated to the big screen. Minor changes in origins and relationships get forgiven when the viewer gets to see their childhood (and maybe even adulthood) heroes brought to life on the siver screen. Marvel's decision to bring the feel of the new issues of the X-Men comics closer to the movie version, was probably a good one. The film itself has so many suprises for the fan of the comic, that the viewer's eye will dart from scene to scene trying to find all the film's character cameos and \\"easter eggs\\". The film's translation to DVD will probably be a view's delight. Brian Singer's direction in the film should be lauded, because of the sheer amount of character development you see with the growing number of different x-people in the film. His ability to juggle so many different characters, and actors has definitly grown since The Usual Suspects. Singer does a good job of showing respect to the material. Even slightnuances of the actors' performances at different instances in the film is artfully juggled. (See any character tied to the morphing of Mystique for proof). Hugh Jackman's performance leads the star-studded cast. His portrayal of Wolverine anchors the movie to the cheers of moviegoers-as they relish in the character's adamantium clawed rage. Jackman deftly displays his control of the character's complexity as his interaction with the different castmemembers is seen from scene to scene. Also noteworthy is Ian Mckellan's reprisal of his role as Magneto. It drips with a wonderful amount of sarcasm and dignity that even the most jaded of fans would have to admit that the casting choice was a good one. Alan Cummings's Nightcrawler will probably make lots of children want alot of blue makeup for Halloween this year. The character's addition was a good choice for the film. As the group's makeup starts to get closer to the classic John Byrne/Chris Claremont era of the comic. The X-Men movie franchise has been solidified well. X-Men 2 (X2) draws certain similarities to other sequels like Empire Strikes Back, Godfather 2, and The Two Towers-in its strength as a movie in a series. Fans of the film, movie-goers, and comic books fans will probably argue that its much better than the first film, and its placement in the series. Arguably the film has outmatched its predecessor in many aspects. Much like Empire, the film presents a plot thread that doesn't get resolved at the end of the film. Young fans and people not familiar with the X-Men's history will definitely have questions unanswered at the film's end. For the requirements of a sequel, the film goes a long way of going above and beyond its prerequisites. The movie viewer will be content at the film's end, but saddened that they cannot watch the next film-right away. The anticipation for the next installment of the film will feel arduous. But, at least X-Men 2 has done its job well.  The franchise is in the able and steady hands of Mr. Singer. And as Professor Xavier says \\"I think everything is going to be just fine.\\"
B00003CXDB|5.0|While the subject of the stock market and trading on Wall Street doesn't interest me in the least, I loved how Oliver Stone made it interesting is \\"Wall Street\\". It stands as one of his most intellegent and accomplished films, with a smart (if overly-technical) script and superb acting.<br />Charlie Sheen, the quintessential 80's heartthrob, takes on a new role as Bud Fox, an ambitious young stock trader. He works his days selling stocks, all the while hoping to be a player in the same league as the big guys. One such big guy is Gordon Gekko (Michaek Douglas, in a standout performance), a millionaire tycoon who makes his living buying out companies and liquidating them for profit. He takes Fox under his wing, gives him a taste of the wealth and power, and Fox becomes insatiable. So much that he makes some wrong decisions, not realizing that this new power and wealth comes at a higher cost, one that he cannot afford.<br />The 80's was characterized by hotshot young executives looking for the quick and easy buck, and Oliver Stones portrayed that very well here. Gordon Gekko is the benchmark corporate villian, someone who one see's the world only in shades of green. The acting in this movie is first rate, especially from Michael Douglas. The long lines of dialogue, the speeches, and the emotional undertones are a challenge for any actor, and all involved here did an excellent job. I often watch \\"Wall Street\\" just for the acting.<br />The DVD is not a full-blown Special Edition, but it's a quality release nonetheless. Oliver Stone's commentary is insightful and articulate, even though he rambles and speaks in an annoying deep voice. The \\"Making Of\\" documentary is a real treat. Simply titled \\"Money Never Sleeps\\", it is over 1 hour of new interviews with the cast and crew, discussing all major points of the movie and the stories behind the scenes. It is one of the better DVD-exclusive documentaries I have seen.<br />Whether or not you find the subject interesting, \\"Wall Street\\" is a great movie in almost every way. While the script wanders off into technical stock jargon, it is one of the best scripts I have ever seen put to film. The acting is top notch, and Oliver Stone directs with panache and style. A must have.Street\\" is a great movie in almost every way. While the script wanders off into technical stock jargon, it is one of the best scripts I have ever seen put to film.

B00008J4P5|5.0|Most of the other reviews have said all that needs to be said.  This will go down as one of the best rock albums of all time.
B00005YW4H|4.0|This is an excellent cd for those mellow times, I'm thinking late nights, either alone or with company. It's been solid background music for me many times, including paper writing and book reading. It's very quality music, and though I wouldn't recommend it to get you started in the morning, it is a good cd to settle you down after a long day.
0743455967|5.0|Before I discuss this book, readers should know I have probably read fewer Stephen King Horror novels than any living American. I have little time for his epics - I prefer to watch the movie versions.<br />Why? Most novels I read need to be less than 150 pages or I lose interest. I see a 300 page novel and I fear I'll get bogged down with descriptions of yet another unique acacia tree or that sun's ray with some peculiar glow. I'm not accusing King of having done so in his novels, it is just that I remember too many of those books from when I was a youth in the 60s.<br />Besides, I am more of a non-fiction buff. That was why the first Stephen King book I have ever read cover-to-cover is On Writing - A Memoir Of The Craft.<br />This is a terrific book that honestly discusses the inner needs a budding author must have without wasting too much time discussing the nuts and bolts.<br />King once wrote, &quot;I write because I cannot not write.&quot; This has always stuck in my mind.<br />In On Writing King mentions that good writers are good readers. The man goes nowhere without a book close at hand and an audiobook in his car.<br />That comment is worth reams of advice. I know far too many writers who seldom read even one book a year but think they are qualified to write a best-selling novel. Whatever your interest, it can't but make for a more compelling book if you have read a dozen or more similar books.<br />His advice on how to write active, instead of passive was also beneficial. Just as does King confess, I tend to be unsure as to whether I am understood and thusly(!), revert to the &quot;ly&quot; verb. If you're confused by this line you won't be after reading On Writing.<br />His frank discussion of telepathy and comparison to the same is a breath of fresh air. In many ways writing is telepathy. Some will scoff at his free acceptance of telepathy and the psychic phenomena. Not me though. I know for a fact it is for real. At least sometimes for some of us.<br />Still, even if readers don't ascribe to esp, if they can imagine that they are sending their thoughts into the future to someone thousands of miles away, they will then have the necessary imagination to convey their musings with just the right amount of description.<br />I appreciate that King did not bog us down with the discussion of how to plot a story. Good stories are usually what-ifs and King points this out. He also opens us to how most good stories are inspired by blending two or more common but isolated observations. Carrie was such a story.<br />Within 288 pages King has masterfully shown aspiring writers how to:<br />1 - Write an autobiography (his, with just the right amount of humor and tragedy).<br />2 - How to develop idea-driven fiction not overladen with detail and description.<br />3 - How to write a concise article in reverse pyramid style (his encounter with a van that nearly killed him.<br />The man did this without preaching and without overly stressing the value of this secret or that secret.<br />No aspiring fiction writer should be without this book.

B000089RVX|5.0|This cd is really awsome, the songs are catchy and Amy's voice is so so so good! Some are relaxing and some tracks will give you goose bumps! There is no way to describing it, My favorite cd after tatu's !!!
B00005JL2O|4.0|The first time I saw this movie, there were basically two thoughts that stood out in my mind: (1)  The first five minutes are absolutely hilarious, and (2)  The rest of the movie had absolutely no plot whatever.  However, with repeated viewings, the movie grows on you.  Just don't expect any plot.  All of the recurring characters are back (except Mustafa, what's wrong, didn't they want to kill him again?), and the new players Foxxy Cleopatra, Goldmember, and Nigel Powers (played quite well by Michael Caine) all fit in nicely as well.  A nice addition also is Fred Savage as a \\"mole\\" planted in Dr. Evil's organization.  <br />What little plot there is concerns a collaboration across time between Dr. Evil, back from space, and Goldmember, the owner of a swinging disco lounge in 1975 New York City, to destroy the world, just because they are evil and that is what evil guys do.  In order to stop Austin Powers, they decide for some strange reason to kidnap his father in 2003 and hold him hostage in 1975.  Without betraying too much of what little plot there is, let me just say that if you've seen the first two movies, you have a pretty good idea of what to expect.  <br />Basically, if you liked the first two movies (especially the second one), you will like this one.  If you didn't, then you won't.
B00008S2VF|1.0|I'd always been obsessed with Madonna. I suppose it's not a healthy obsession but I'm over it. Where does she get off singing about what's wrong with our lifestyles as americans? We're materialistic... duh. This from the material girl? This from the woman who recently declared that she loves Britain so much more than the US that she had bought a whole bunch of houses there? I love Britain, but as an ex-pat rich pig she's got less of a foot to stand on in criticizing us poor working slobs. Most of us would be happy with one house. In her song, &quot;American Life,&quot; she talks all about having a butler and cars and possesions but that it's not those things that make her happy. If her riches aren't important then why isn't she sharing her music for free? I had to buy it and I want my money back. It's a farce of an album and I regret putting that money in her pocket so that she could go spend it across the atlantic where she looks down on us Americans. She lacks any relevance now. She is no longer important and she should have quit while she was ahead.
0783226063|3.0|Okay, well, I have only a \\"few\\" problems with this adaptation of one of my favorite books of all time, Dune.  I give it a three because I enjoyed the movie at times, and thought that it did a lot to stay close to the actual book.  I liked hearing what the characters were thinking, and many of the scenes were directly from the novel... however there are a few things I would change...<br />I would add at least an hour to the movie.  It attempts to cover so much in such a short amount of time, anything less than three hours and you have what we have with this movie, a choppy, condensed version that leaves you wanting more information and depth.<br />I would have liked for them to acknowledge Jessica's and Paul's Harkonnen heritage, Jessica being the daughter of the Baron.  It played an interesting role in the book, and showed the intricacy of the Bene Gesserit breeding plans.<br />Finally, where the hell did the Wierding Voice Gun's come from?  I don't like them... infact I don't like how gun's are used throughout the movie, where blades were used in the books, and for good reasons.  Obviously, the majority used blades cause guns could be stopped by shields and shields would blow the hell up if hit by lasguns.  So, I didn't like the guns.  And the Sardaukar should have been disguised as they were.<br />I did like...<br />Excellent choice of actors, and more fitting to the roles (at times) than the miniseries from Sci-Fi.<br />The attention to detail at time, and showing the close ups, and Bene Gesserit observation.  Very nice.  Also, Sean Young is hot (hope this doesn't discredit me too much, she is), and plays a good Channi.<br />Anyway, I kind of liked it, but a lot irked me, so you make your choice.  It is worth watching, and no adaptation can compare to the majesty of the Dune series.
B00005JKPF|5.0|When sitting down to watch this movie, I was expecting more of the same as we saw in the original. What a surprise! The action's far better, the CGI is better, and we are kept guessing as to whether good will REALLY win over evil right up till the last five minutes of the movie. New characters are well-rounded, and the visual effects and filming are rich to look and marvel at. It would be worth the price of the ticket just to see the amazing acion in the first scene with Nightcrawler going against the President's Security Detail. Action and FX galore! A definite five out of five.
B00005JKPF|5.0|I saw X2 the day it came out and I was very satisfied. I thought it was by far better than the first. More action and more mutants. I've also grown a better appreciation for Wolverine in this as he was continually hacking up soldiers. Nightcrawler was pretty ownage too with his teleport and hit fighting. Good action and good acting. I did think that Mystique in Wolverine's tent scene was pretty pointless. Even after two days the wanting to see it again is still bothering me. Definately five stars.
0316666343|1.0|As a bookstore employee, I heard much hype about this book from customers purchasing it (who, ironically were talking up a book they had yet to read). I decided to give it a shot as it sounded as though it had an interesting premise. <BR>The beginning of this book was alright, good enough for me to be interested. The rest however, is mediocre at best. It did not seem to me to be very well-written, at times I thought it would be best as \\"Teen Fiction\\" rather than a book meant for adults. The characters were developed very little and at the end I was left feeling dissappointed. I would not recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a \\"Grown-Up\\" book. It is not worth all the hype it has received.
0375758992|5.0|As an ex Rhodesian, also known as a when-we, I was very hesitant about reading this book... too much memory, too much pain and way too much longing for home.. But I bought it, and I loved it, I cried my eyes out, so much seemed to have been taken from my own past. Well done Ms. Fuller... I recomend this book as the best book I've read in years.
6302891272|4.0|I saw this movie &quot;Throne of blood&quot; during the class and I really enjoyed it. I think Akira Kurosawa was able to show the main point of Macbeth by using Japanese style movie. Still, there was some part where it was little different from actual Shakespear's Macbeth, such as, the ending, or the climax. Washizu was killed by his own men. I think this ending showed Kurosawas uniqueness in significant way.
B00006L83N|5.0|I purchased this album after hearing Symphony X open for Bling Guardian in concert.  I was very impressed with their live performance and immediately bought this album.<br />Odyssey will not disappoint!  It is both lyrically and musically complex with unqiue sounds -- a must-have for metal lovers.  The guitars are loud but not overpowering and the vocals are beautiful yet still very metal.<br />This album is a refreshing break from the popular &quot;nü metal&quot; of today.
B000002JSN|5.0|This is the album that turned me on to Led Zepplin. I origanally bought it after I bought it beacause I heard Kashmere on the radio. But after hearing the rest of the album,I was equaly empressed.not only is the album hihgly entertaining,I also found it to be highly vairied. In the first disk alone, I found traces of funk,blues,folk,and middle eastern(ish)music,and pop,mixed in to all of the rock.<BR>     To me the second disk took me some time to get in to, wheras the first, I almost instantly fell in love with. It is a bit mellower than the first disk. With the exception of Sick Again, and The Wonton Song.The album as a whole is flawless. After this purchase, I bought Led Zepplin II,and IV. Both were(almost) as good as this. But I hope that the next Led Lepplin albums are equally as entertaining
B00000DMJF|5.0|Well what can I say that many have not said here already.  All I know that this a great album that I still, after all of these years, play the entire album in one sitting (over 90 min).  I have the Album, tape, and both the old 1987 and the new 30th annv CDs, yes what a [...] to buy this newest one.  I thought it was a remastered version but was sad to hear and then later read that it was not.  I like the package even thought it is so small.  That is why the LP was so cool, big pics, big words, big posters and great sound and so on.<br />This album has a life of it's own and should not be compared to SGT Pepper or Revolver or others.  It is a different type of album, but not a concept album.  It does not sound like any of their other works or anyone else in 1968.  Pepper and Mystery Tour had been done and the summer of love was over.  The Beatles must have had a different idea and it seems to have worked, for me it has.<br />George Martin has said he thought it would have made a great single album of 12-14 songs, but what songs do you leave off???  I have tried to pick 12-14 and can't do it.  This album sold very very well in 1968-69 and beyond.  If you do not have the CD then I recommend you find a good record player and pick up a clean copy and give it a whirl along with all of their other albums.  You will like all of them.  Then when they remaster or do that SACD or DVD audio thing then get this and all of their other albums too.  You can't go wrong with this album.<br />Whatever you do just sit back relax and give it a listen.  Remember, this is The Beatles.<br />Please please us...<br />Capitol/EMI do the fans a favor and REMASTER this and all of The Beatles CDs ASAP.  What is the hold up anyway???  You know we will buy them.  I have [$$$] burning a hole in my pocket right now just waiting for you greedy exec's.
B000035P7X|5.0|This documentary was shot during Bob Dylan's tour of England in 1965. At this point, most fans of popular music only knew the name \\"Bob Dylan\\" because his music was being re-sung by pop-musicians, such as Peter,Paul & Mary & The Byrds.<br />Film maker D.A. Pennebaker decided he was going to follow young Dylan around, and capture a private look at someone who still wasn't fully exposed to the pop-world. This was a time when Dylan was just starting to rise up, and become a pop-identity of his own.<br />\\"Don't Look Back\\" gave most viewers their very first look at this poetical folk singer, who obviously was having a hard time handling his fast growing popularity as a song writer/singer. Yes, for most of the movie we see Bob giving everyone around him a hard time....well, can you blame the poor guy? When you're only 24 years of age and everyone's analyzing every word you say, and wanting to know WHY you said it...and bothering you to sign autographs...and demanding you be a romodel, JUST because you wrote some good songs....it's a little hard to deal with. <br />Bob Dylan played head-games and snarled at people for one plain and simple reason. PROTECTION! The only way he could protect himself against media and fans, was to be vicious and cocky. Who knows...maybe behind closed doors he was the nicest guy you'd ever want to meet. <br />This is quite an interesting look, at one great artist who not only inspired such bands as The Beatles, but also inspired many young song writers to speak their minds, in a way that helped change the world!
0316666343|5.0|I couldn't put the book down. It has a great description of what heaven might be like.

B00006L3S3|4.0|Like the other Lennon remasters, the sound is greatly improved.  The disappointing factor is the abbreviated fade-out on &quot;Meat City&quot;.  During the fade on the vinyl LP, Lennon says &quot;Who is that?  Who is that?  Who is that?  Who ... is ... that?  And why are they doing ... those ... strange ...... things?&quot;  When the original CD was issued years ago, the last word (&quot;things&quot;) was missing.  Now this remastered edition omits the entire last question.  I guess another &quot;improved&quot; version will arrive in a few years and I can buy this album again.
B00005OAIE|4.0|I have been a John fan for years now, and absolutely love this cd. My favorite song is My Stupid Mouth- who can not relate to this song?  It's about the uncomfortable social situations we all experience.  If John is not exactly your type, try Jason Mraz.  He is a little funkier, not as slow, and more fun.  Ari Hest whose cd is available on his site- [...]- is also one of my favorites.  Jack Johnson, Matt Nathanson, Pete Yorn are all excellent musicians as well.  Out of these artists, you are bound to find one you can relate to.
6305226296|5.0|What a great concert.  They put on a hell of a show.  I wish they had some of the songs that they deleted on there &quot;One Night Only&quot; CD.  I appreciate there &quot;Still Waters&quot; album even more than before.  They sang &quot;Closer than Close&quot; which I didn't know that Maurice sang lead vocals on.  I always love hearing him sing.  He has a wonderful voice.  They also sang &quot;Still Waters&quot; from there latest album.  &quot;Alone&quot; is also another song that they also sang.  They sound just as good live than they do on any album.  Since the sudden passing of Maurice these live concerts mean even more.  If you are a big fan don't pass this one up.  You won't be dissappointed.  It is the last time we will see this great sweet man sing in concert again.  Happy listening.
B00005JLT5|3.0|Polanski, a survivor of what we have all come to accept as 'humanities darkest hour '(notwithstanding many other equally confounding, affecting and, as yet, cinematically un-surveyed 'darkest hour''s) has delivered a curiously affected, slovenly piece. All the sketched outlines of an outstanding film are present and accounted for: galvanising (if overly familiar) backdrop, a strong central perspective and experiential trajectory (in the form of Szpilman's tenacious, determined character), excellent production values. All that is missing is a sense of effort on the part of those most centrally involved.<br />Polanski's direction is undistinguished, mechanical, heaving the 'The Pianist' along with all the zeal of a put upon carry donkey. The pace of the film is leaden and contains a high 'oh, get on with it' quotient, which should be fatal for a film with such high-minded, literate pretensions. The scenes of the ruined Warsaw ghetto are intensely re-created, but fall more or less in line with those images we have come to expect from a film dealing with an aspect of the Holocaust, adding absolutely nothing onto the already fixed perceptions burnished onto (many of) our collective conscience (courtesy, in some ways, to the far superior 'Schndler's List').   <br />The main problem with this film, most puzzlingly (read: alarmingly), is Oscar winner Adrien Brody. Although sporting the requisite haunted look, he never quite gets under his character's skin, or allows sufficient erudition as to his motivations (a must in a realist text like this). This robs the already moribund film of what could have been its greatest, and saving, virtue. <br />All said, the film is not bad, per se. It might have been more accomplished. Hopefully Hollywood will now shift its attention to some other worthy historical texts.
B00005JL96|5.0|It's hard to write anything new or informative when 300+ other reviews have been written.  I did want to say that most of the negative reviews of this movie mention violence or rudeness of characters.  People forget that Disney is not only making movies for 3-7 years old kids.  They also have to attract teenagers and adults.  Great movie, my neice and newphew both love it and I highly recommend it to those whose pants aren't on too tight.
B00003CX5A|4.0|This movie was not at all what I was expecting.  That is a good thing.  The marketing of this movie made me think that it was firmly set in the action/adventure genre.  Not really my cup of tea - that.  I suppose I should have known better with Johnny Depp and Christina Ricci starring and Tim Burton at the helm, but they wouldn't have been the first to do commercial [stuff] to supplement more worthy films.  (please note that not all commercial is [bad] and not all [stuff] is commercial)  Anyway, I really enjoyed the movie and indeed, I bought it.  It was dark and mysterious and whodunnit and magical and they didn't really follow up with the gadget thing.
B00005JKPF|5.0|Comic book movies have had a long history of being disappointing to say the least. Aside from Superman, Spider-Man, and the first X-Men movie there have not been many that would be considered noteworthy. But with the first X-Men movie something changed.<br /> The first X-Men movie was not perfect, but was pretty darn close. It was very true to the spirit of the comic it was based on, featured good one-liners, and was over all a very enjoyable experience. I gave the first X-Men movie a five star rating, I liked it that much. For a sequel to surpass the original when I gave the original a five star rating is something spectacular. I wish there was a rating that I could give X2 that would be double what I gave the original, it was that drastically improved, and the original was not so severely flawed to begin with.<br /> The acting in X2 was improved over the original, with Halley Barry (Storm) having dropped the cheesy accent, and James Mardesen not being as dry as he was in his previous outing. Everyone seems to be much more comfortable with their roles this time, and much more capable. Nightcrawler is loveable and funny just like in the comic books, yet you also feel sorry for him in that even his fellow mutants seem to be taken a back by his appearance at first glance. Alan Cummings did wonderful in this role. One compliant I had in the comics was Lady Deathstryke and her cheesy dialogue. They kept her quiet for the movie; as a result she came off as cooler, and much deadlier.<br /> The plot is also loosely based on my all time favorite X-Men story, God loves Man Kills, and so it was nice to see so many references to the source material, as well as a number of mutant cameos like Colossus, Shadow Cat (albeit played by a different actress than X1) and many others.<br /> The best part of the movie was the way the movie ended. I am trying not to give out too many spoilers these days, but Phoenix fans will get a kick out of the movie's ending. Let us hope that it does not take too long for them to get the third movie under way, when considering how much better this movie was than the original, I now have very high expectations for the third film, especially since it very likely will end up being a movie version of the legendary Phoenix Saga! All in all, this movie definitely warrants repeat theater viewings, and is now one of my most anticipated DVDs, second only to the Two Towers Extended Edition. In short, if you like super heroes you have to see this movie!e too long for them to get the third movie under way, when considering how much better this movie was than the original, I now have very high expectations for the third film, especially since it very likely will end up being a movie version of the legendary Phoenix Saga!

B00005JKPF|5.0|My, oh my!  I just watched this movie the second time in four days and boy, did it rock!  Mmm ... let me count the number of times I cheered heartily during this movie (don't read if you don't want any spoilers):<br />1. Nightcrawler teleporting in and out, to and fro, again and again, during his attack on the Oval Office!  I couldn't have imagined that scene being done any better.  In the wrong hands, a teleporting mutant would have looked about as convincing as Scotty beaming up Captain Kirk.<br />2. Dr. Hank McCoy!  Despite hopes being crushed that the Beast will be a main character in X2, the lovable amazing blue furry mutant still managed to make a small cameo in his human guise as the good doctor.<br />3. Wolverine going into his berserker rage during Stryker's raid on the X-Mansion!  NO ONE could have been a better Wolverine than Hugh Jackman, despite the fact that he is a foot taller than the Wolverine in the comics.<br />4. Colossus suiting up in his steel-armor!  Whoa!  I wish he had a bigger role in X2, but I'm sure there will always be X3.<br />5. Kitty Pryde passing through her bed and then through the bedroom floor!  Siryn's earth-shattering scream!  Still, X2 missed letting Jubilee (the Asian girl) do her stuff to defend the X-Mansion during the raid.  In the comics, she was a gutsy and independent girl who would have done her best to confound the raiders.<br />6. Pyro going psycho!  Way hot scene for the way cool hothead.<br />7. Storm finally gets to show who's the boss.  Twisters galore!  Halle Berry finally gets to sink her teeth into her role as the white-haired weather goddess.  <br />8. Magneto and Mystique save the day!  When was the last time you cheered for the VILLAINS?  Ian McKellen is simply amazing as the flawed and vulnerable but nevertheless evil Magneto.<br />9. Jean Grey versus Cyclops! Wolverine versus Lady Deathstrike!  Professor X versus mind-controlling evil mutant!  Climatic battles worthy of Star Wars movies!<br />10. Final scenes possibly setting the pace for X3: The Dark Phoenix Saga!  (X-Men neophytes might like to know that in the comics, Jean Grey eventually became the immensely powerful and destructive cosmic entity known as the Dark Phoenix - it took all of the X-men's might to stop her path of destruction across the galaxy.  If Bryan Singer is planning to make his own version of the Dark Phoenix Saga, I'll be jumping up and down with joy.)<br />Need I say more?  Bryan Singer, bring on X3!!
B000051S3H|1.0|This film version of Jane Eyre has turned Charlotte Bronte's gothic novel into an episode of the Twilight Zone, evidenced by degenerative dialogue, a raucous musical score and unimpressive photography.  The underlying themes of the necessity of faith and moral integrity in Bronte's novel has been transformed into humanitarian ethic, and the love between Edward and Jane  which encompasses body, mind and soul, in this film has none of the passion found in the novel.
6305426651|5.0|I've been dying to get my hands on this since 1998. when I finally dead, i bought as many copies, and gave it to friends. this is a must-see, honestly! the kind of movie that makes you laugh one second, and cry the other. <BR>the most moving scene to me would be when Dora  listened to her husband and baby in the concentration camp. it goes straight to the heart.
0380973642|5.0|I have a love-hate relationship with Neil Gaiman.  I love his work.  His diction is always impeccable, always inspired.  But I hate that I somehow lose a day when I start reading one of his books.  I get so wrapped up in the story, in the world that he weaves, that I cannot put the book down.<br />I started reading this short story collection thinking that this may be the solution to my love-hate relationship.  I could not have been more wrong.  Even when the story is a mere hundred words (as is 'Nicholas Was ...'), I simply could not stop reading.  After each story, I would pause to shiver or reflect (or, often, both).  Occasionally, I would flip back to the beginning to read the introduction where the author discusses each story and how it came about.  Then, I would plunge into the next story.  I finished the book in less than a day, including flipping back and reading several stories again.<br />This collection of short stories is an excellent introduction to the world of Neil Gaiman.  One of the strengths of the author is showing an alternate perspective.  You could look at each of these stories (including the one buried in the introduction) as doing just that.  The haunting 'Nicholas Was ...' and 'Snow, Glass, Apples' show us that maybe Santa Claus isn't a jolly old man and that maybe Snow White wasn't an innocent pure girl driven out by an evil uncaring stepmother. <br />Individually, each of the stories is an excellent example of what comes off of a gifted writer's pen (or keyboard, as it were).  Together, this collection is riveting and engaging.  In the years to come, I am sure that I will pull this book off my shelf often to read a story or two (or all of them) again.
B00005JKJA|5.0|I love this movie.  I had the chance to see Mulholland Drive at the theater, where I was completely swept away for 2 hours and 30 minutes.  Then I bought the dvd, and have watched the film through numerous times by myself, and showed it to friends.  (Most were baffled and just gave up, *sigh*) <br />However, what the heck is up with this DVD?  Excellent picture? Check.  Excellent sound? Check.  Special Features....ummm...well...<br />I don't really mind that there are no chapter stops, because Lynch insists that \\"films are not books, they do not need chapters\\".  Thats fine by me.  But, some regions in Europe have a 2 disc special edition!  The dvd includes full length press conference intreviews from the Cannes (or is it Sundance?) Film Festival, among making of features and more.  <br />Lynch's website ... sells his \\"Short films\\" and \\"Eraserhead\\" dvds exclusively in lavish special editions that come in 8x8 boxes with booklets.  On both, Lynch contributes interviews.  (Eraserhead is the brilliant first film from Lynch)  Maybe he can treat Mulholland Drive with the same respect and release an 8x8 box with a two dvd set?  Espically because there is such an amazing history to the film, being that it was supposed to be a TV show!  I would love to hear what Lynch was planning to do with that idea!  <br />I believe that some time in the future, Lynch will give us a special edition, even more so now that there are ones of Blue Velvet and Ereaserhead.  I just hope Mulholland Drive is next in line!
B000089RVX|5.0|Everything about this band just sounds right.  It has a strong female vocal, a piano accompianiment (which I personally appreciate), and ear-catching digital-effects to round out the songs.  Previous reviewiers have done a great job reviewing this album, so I'd like to comment on their earlier work.<br />Fallen is not actually their first album. In 1999 they put out a couple of VERY limited release demo cds:  EP and Sound Asleep, limited to 100 and 50 copies.  Happily you can download some of the material if you look around the web hard enough.  They also put out a full lengnth album in November 2000 titled Origin. It's playlist is as follows:<BR>1. Origin<BR>2. Whisper<BR>3. Imaginary<BR>4. My Immortal<BR>5. Where Will You Go<BR>6. Field Of Innocence<BR>7. Even In Death<BR>8. Anywhere<BR>9. Lies<BR>10. Away From Me<BR>11. Eternal<br />Tracks 2, 3, and 4 appear on Fallen.  As I've only recently begun researching the band, I don't know what the difference is (if any) between the different album versions.  Maybe someone who knows would care to share this?  I'm afraid I didn't have time to read all 572 previous reviews to see if it's already been pointed out :(<br />What I've heard on Origin is almost as good if not better than Fallen.  I personaly like Even in Death, Field of Innocence, and Eternal. Lies will absolutely blow you away,it my favorite song.  I also highly recommend Solitude, a track from their EP album.<br />In closing I would definitely recommend Evanescence is you like a fresh sound, with more than a touch of melancholy and lyrics you can actully relate to and think about.  If anyone has more info on the early albums, please share it :)  It wouldn't surprise me if more of their earlier songs show up on new albums, or are re-released.
6304211740|3.0|The real stars of this film version of Jane Eyre are Thornfield and the English Countryside - the photography is breathtaking.  But the actors who play Mr. Rochester and Jane Eyre are not really suited to the parts.  The acting is good, but without passion.  This to my mind is a very Plain Jane version of Charlotte Bronte's novel.
0800177975|1.0|This has to be one of the worst movies ever made. Terrible plot, and all the co-stars can't act at all. A big budget movie that should have never been made. A giant black mark on Arnold's career.
B00006HBUB|5.0|I thought this movie was very good. Although I didn't watch the cartoons that much as a kid, this one was made pretty well. It had just enough mystery and such so that us teens aren't bored out of our minds with kiddy stuff, yet it isn't so frightening and scary that it'd scare the wits out of those little kids.
B00005JLT5|4.0|The Pianist is a good film, but not great.  I don't understand why this was such a big winner at the Oscars!  (Even though Chicago took home double as many Awards, with 6)  <br />First- I don't think Adrien Brody deserved the Best Actor Award.  Did anyone even see Nick Cage in Adaptation!?  He was so excellent.  The only reason why he didn't win was becasue that movie had an off-beat type of brilliance.  <br />Second- Why in the world did Roman Polanski win?  In a way I am glad the Martian Scorsese didn't win because I believe he'll be back in the upcoming years with an even better film that will sweep the awards, including Best Director.  But, what about Rob Marshall?  Chicago would have been nothing without him!  Rob had the great idea for the musical numbers being metaphors and daydreams in Roxie's head.  Plus, Marshall choreographed all the numbers!  That is amazing dedication.  Plus the editing was smooth and well done.  I just didn't sense that Polanski had the same pashion.<br />Thirdly- Charlie Kauffman had the Oscar stolen from him for best screenplay: adapted material.  Every scene and line in Adaptation shines with creative characters and brilliant words.  Actually, the movie's main showcase is the writting, because it is SO GOOD!  I have NO idea why the pianist won, and if you see Adaptation, you'll be wondering too. <br />That being said, I thought that The Pianist was definetly one of the better films over the past year.  I think everybody knows that this is nowhere near Schindler's List.  But, then again, what film about this subject matter is?  Not a bad effort at all.  But, not worthy of all the praise.
B00005JKPF|3.0|My best friend often makes fun of my taste in movies; specifically, she doesn't understand why I enjoy films that are 'deliberately paced' (read: boring).  Thing is, I've always been a fan of character-based, psychological dramas.  And I liked this movie because it emphasized character while still supplying decent action.  Now, this doesn't mean that I liked the movie as much as, say, 'The Piano Teacher', but I thought it was certainly better than the first installment (which was diverting, but somestimes just a series of gimmicky set-pieces).  <br />Wolverine and Jean Gray (my favourite character) get the most to work with and, not suprisingly, Hugh Jackman and Famke Janssen give the best performances (even though the latter is sometimes forced to utter dialogue that sounded like it was from the mouth of Deanna Troi).  Rebecca Romijn-Stamos does much the same thing she did in the first movie, but her character now seems stronger and more resourceful.  Ian McKellen doesn't have much to do, but he has a couple of good scenes and generally makes good use of his limited screen time.  And Brian Cox does a good job with his role as the (somewhat generic) villain.<br />However, those characters with relatively little to do on screen still register relatively poorly (as they did in the first movie).  Halle Berry shows much more conviction than she did the first time out, but she can't quite save herself from some of the howlers she has to deliver.  Alan Cumming makes a hell of an entrance as Nightcrawler, but his Teutonic Catholic schtick (and garish makeup) wear very thin very quickly.  Anna Paquin still has to learn to pick an accent and stick with it.  And poor Patrick Stewart, his character is basically neutralized; as a result, he just comes across as weak (and many of his lines are just too stupid for words).  <br />Ultimately, it's a good action movie for people who (like me) don't like action movies, though there are enough problematic elements to keep it from being a great one.
B000006YYM|5.0|In many ways, a breakthrough for this underappreciated quintet, Gentle Giant seemed poised to take on the mainstream with this, their first release on Capitol Records in 1975. They even enjoyed their first (if not only?) airplay on L.A.'s KMET with the song &quot;Playing the Game&quot;.  Despite other reviewers' claims of more dissonance than other albums, that is maybe the case on the first two songs, but the rest of this collection is pretty solid, funky, more repetitious and accessible than this exceptionally creative group had been up to this point.  For more dissonance, check out the later release &quot;Interview&quot;.<br />Further clarification is in order: One reviewer claims this to be GG's first concept album.  That claim belongs to &quot;Three Friends&quot;, released two albums previously.  Others have compared GG on this release to Pink Floyd and Van Der Graaf Generator.  They are nothing like either of those groups, though I can hear a slight similarity between the openings of &quot;Aspirations&quot; (a beautiful, reflective, jazzy piece) and &quot;Plague of Lighthouse-Keepers&quot;.  But to lump Gentle Giant in with other styles of prog of that period ..... uh-uh.  They had a sound unto themselves, a deliriously syncopated, hard rocking blend of medieval madrigal and funk, and seemed to have more fun playing this highly complex hybrid of sound than many of their self-serious contemporaries.  If you asked them what music they enjoyed, they would drop names like War, Funkadelic and Rufus ....... you get the idea.<br />Back to this album: Yes, there is a concept, and it does tell a very political tale of rise to power, ideals, confidence, manipulation, compromise, betrayal and abuse.  Interestingly enough, Power and the Glory came out towards the end of the Nixon Watergate scandal ..... heard in that context, there's a whole other idea of why this album was well-received.  Political implications aside, the music is perfectly performed (with just the right amount of dirty edge), cleanly recorded and, as stated before, contains a musical freshness and energy like few others before or since.  It's kind of sad that something released nearly 30 years ago can be so much more alive and innovative than current fare ...... but I guess that really depends on what kind of ears one brings to it.<br />Ultimately, if YOUR ears are starved for something classic that sounds new, recorded at a time when notes and musical knowledge mattered, plug this one in, turn it up loud, and prepare for some serious (but fun) jaw-dropping ecstasy.<br />&quot;The gentlest music I've 'eard ..... aside from thunderstorms.&quot; -the Giantamount of dirty edge), cleanly recorded and, as stated before, contains a musical freshness and energy like few others before or since.

B00008NRI8|3.0|\\"Two Weeks Notice\\" is another pleasant, mildly diverting romantic comedy from Sandra Bullock's production company. The director, Marc Lawrence, also wrote the script. He was responsible for penning [but not directing] two other Bullock successes, \\"Miss Congeniality\\" and \\"Forces of Nature\\". If \\"Two Weeks Notice\\" to those films, it's only because the co-star is the marvelous Hugh Grant, who could make a movie about constructing chicken coops charming and funny. The difference between Ms. Bullock and Mr. Grant is that she is only as good as the material she is given, whereas he can rise above even the most mediocre script. <br />In this romantic romp, Bullock plays Lucy Kelson, a Harvard educated lawyer from Coney Island. She battles to save an historic community center from being destroyed by a billionaire real estate tycoon, George Wade [Grant]. Charmed by his promises to save the center, she winds up working for him. Eventually, the job proves too frustrating for her because her solid work ethic clashes with his playboy attitude. She gives her notice, which he seems to accept cheerfully. During the course of her working out her notice, it becomes clear that, while they can't work together, their relationship may work out on another, more intimate level.<br />The film romps happily and swiftly through it rather flimsy plot. Issues like the community center's being saved naturally take a back seat to the issue of Lucy and George's relationship's being salvaged. The problems are that the dialog isn't that sharp and that most of the jokes fall a bit flat. Still, Bullock and Grant have a pleasant enough chemistry and are obviously having a good time. One can only hope that Bullock will soon find a writer who can successfully hone in on her true comedic talents. In the right hands, she could be the funniest leading actress in movies today.
0671027379|5.0|After reading the INCREDIBLE 'Da Vinci Code' and the equally exciting 'Angels & Demons' I figured I couldn't go wrong with 'Deception Point' and I was 100% RIGHT.  Dan Brown is fast becoming one of my all-time favorite authors.<br />After becoming familiar with Brown's religious thrillers, I was pleasantly surprised to find out that 'Deception Point' was entirely different--but JUST as much fun.  If you enjoy stories about conspiracies that are as big as they come, this story is definitely for YOU.<br />Rachel Sexton works for the Intelligence Community compiling information for the President.  The odd twist in this story is that we are coming up on election time and the man poised to snatch the White House from under the feet of current President Zach Herney is none other than Rachel's own estranged Father, Senator Sedgewick Sexton.  It takes some time to figure out who is indeed the bad guys in this tale--and trust me, you will probably be wrong anyway--but finding out certainly IS a great deal of the fun here.  Rachel is contacted by the President and asked to confirm for his current staff the existence of a Meteor found near the Top of the World.  Not just ANY Meteor, either.  At first Rachel is stunned that the President would be so forward and ask this of the daughter of his biggest rival.  Senator Sexton has been THE single largest thorn in the side of NASA because of their chronic overspending and multi-billion dollar failures--screw-up's that have cost the American taxpayers dearly over the years.  President Herney has been one of NASA's biggest supporters, much to his own detriment in the polls lately.  Rachel actually HAS been chosen specifically because of her relationship to his rival to make this report.  President Herney believes that this discovery will come with a great deal of skepticism, even from his own staff.  So who better to make this announcement than the daughter of the man who wants to TAKE the White House from President Herney?  Rachel agrees under a few stipulations and is off to an Ice Shelf at the North Pole.  This sets the stage for the Mother of ALL Conspiracies, and when you find out the source of WHY it was all hatched, and WHO is behind it, the surprise ought to be rather big (at least it was for me).<br />Is the Meteorite in fact real, and if not, how could NASA have possibly tricked some of the most brilliant scientific minds of the country?  Is the President IN on this possible scandal, or is he a pawn of someone infinitely more devious?  And what about Senator Sexton?  Is he who he says he is?  Are his motives clean and pure, or is he just as bad as those attempting to fraud the world?  There are some honest-to-goodness twists & turns you can expect in 'Deception Point' and a few genuine surprises along the way.  Always fun and actually quite educational about the workings of NASA and it answers the question of why don't we see more privately funded companies winning contracts to launch into space?  Get to know Dan Brown, do it today!  You will NOT be disappointed.  Highly Recommended.rees under a few stipulations and is off to an Ice Shelf at the North Pole.

B00008S2VG|1.0|I am sorry, but Madonna's new album [is unsatisfactory]. The only song I actually liked was \\"American Life\\", \\"Die Another Day\\"  and \\"Hollywood\\". That's it. This album has too many acoustics, the lyrics are pretty dumb, and the music is pretty bad. Nothing like the gems \\"Ray of Light\\" or \\"Music\\". I think Madonna should work with William Orbit again or Shep Pettibone. This is quite shocking for me to say because I have been a fan of Madonna for many many many many years, and I never thought I would give her a bad review, but this album is just bad. Buy instead Ray of Light, Music, Erotica, Something to Remember, Like a Virgin, Madonna(Debut), Like a Prayer, and Bedtime Stories. Those Albums rock!
0064407667|5.0|I personally think Lemony Snicket is unique. He can kick up his courage and write stories without any happiness, while every author ends stories happily, as usual. I also like how he plots and writes the story, because you cannot predict the ending, like you would to other stories.
B00005JKPF|5.0|A few years ago the first X-men movie was released to theaters everywhere. I don't know what it was, the sharp posters that decorated the interior of the theater, the exciting trailer, my past obsession with the cartoon series, my friends recommendation, or the rather attractive guy that plays Cyclops, but I needed to see it. I was not disappointed. The first X-men movie is exciting, with a stronger plot than you see in most action movies, and a talented cast. Because of this I really wanted to see the sequel, and I did not get was I was suspecting to see. What I saw was much more.<br />All around the world a war is brewing, with humans and mutants on either side. This possible war is heightened when an attack is made on the President of the United States. His attacker is a mutant with the power to teleport and fight unlike anyone of the secret service has ever seen before. Everyone on the world knows about the attack including Professor Charles Xavier and the X-men. Meanwhile Logan, also known as the Wolverine, returns to Xavier's mansion after discovering that the one link to his cloudy past has been destroyed. As the X-men filter out of the mansion one by one a dangerous man named Stryker is planning an assault on the Institute, with few full-fledged mutants to defend the young students. All of a sudden the few remaining fighters, and a couple new ones too, are facing a race against time. Professor X has gone missing and if they can't reach him in time something terrible might happen. Now mutants, both good and evil, must unite to stop the force that threatens to wipe out their very existence.<br />The characters are much better developed in this movie. Logan continues as more or less the main character with other characters like Storm, Iceman, and Pyro getting much more screen time. Unfortunately we see less of Rogue and Cyclops but that's necessary to keep the plot moving. Jean Grey goes through some startling transformation that's thrilling to watch. We'reintroduced to a new character that many fans of the comic and cartoon series will be happy to see, Nightcrawler, the mutant with the appearance of a demon but the heart of an angel. Stryker and Lady Deathstrike, who both have a strong link to Logan's mysterious past, make a strong appearance, making life a living hell for every mutant on earth in the process. Blink and you'll miss cameos from Shadowcat, Colossus, Beast (looking far less fury than we're used to), and Gambit.<br />The special effects in this movie, believe it or not, far surpass the ones from the first. For example sometimes Nightcrawler teleports faster than your eyes can catch. Pyro's control of fire is stunning and Mystique's shapeshifting transformations are flawless. Once again, they set up at the end for an even better looking sequel that I just can't wait to see. I have a feeling that this is a movie I'll end up seeing again and again.
0140143505|5.0|I just finished this book yesterday and have the heartfelt desire to establish a long distance correspondence, in the hopes of finding a kindred spirit. In '84 Charing Cross Road', Helene Hanff finds such a person when she responds to an ad for reasonably priced antiquarian books. Over the course of 20 years and numerous letters back and forth you discover the hidden personalities of each person involved--and how all become friends from a distance. Whether it is in the physical gifts of food and other rationed items that Helene sends to Marks &amp; Co, or the prayers that Frank and Nora's children send out to Helene in the hopes that finances will enable her to come out to England. I found myself heartbroken at the turn of events that befell Frank Doel, and made an inner promise to myself to seize the moment. I hope that all who chance upon this book will walk away with something as wonderful as I did.
6300216039|5.0|This is THE must see version of Romeo and Juliet.  Zeffirelli's 1968 masterpiece stars 17-year-old Leonard Whiting and 15-year-old Olivia Hussey with great music by Nino Rota.  Filmed \\"on location\\" in Italy this version also has the fingerprints of the 1960s all over it, from moddish long hair, the debut of Michael York as Tybalt, John McEnery as Mercutio, the lush balcony scenes, the nude scene, and an emotional intensity throughout.  McEnery brings just the right comic touch to the comi-tragedy and screenwriters Franco Brusati, Maestro D'Amico, and Zeffirelli keep true to Shakespeare with a take on the story that's easily accessible to a wide audience, thereby making this one of the most popular films of the '60s.<br />  Especially effective is the ambiguity of intent of the Tybalt-Mercutio duel, and the overall editing of dialogue just enough to keep it succinct and believable yet retain the poetic and philosophical virtuosity of the playwright's playwright.  The music is used effectively and as it rises during the love scenes it's a manipulation that's an enhancement to rather than distraction from the emotion--a rare successful pull-off of this.  And that balcony scene is extraordinary, the lush dark atmosphere, Romeo's giddiness, Juliet's beauty...I believed it.<br />  Milo O'Shea (who later played the Judge in \\"The Verdict\\") does a believable Friar Laurence and Robert Stephens (I)(with a long list of Shakespearian roles to his name) an intensely serious Prince of Verona.  It's hard not to fall in love with Olivia (watch for her new film role as Mother Theresa).<br />  Some bits of trivia:  Before 1968 Romeo and Juliet was not generally taught in US high schools and this film's popularity changed all that as most of you reading this had it in high school.  Michael York turned down the role of Oliver in Love Story--one may read into this he felt it was a poor man's Romeo and Juliet...just a thought.  Also Olivia Hussey briefly dated Prince Charles.  And here's the clincher:  Paul McCartney got the original offer to play Romeo.  I'm glad he turned it down, as Whiting is perfect here.  And for those who wonder, the story did not originate in historical fact, though one may wish it so.  The story came from mythical legend starting in 5th century Greece, later evolving into \\"The Tragical History of Romeus and Juliet\\" translated into English in 1562 by Arthur Brooke and originally written about 1530 by Luigi da Porto., 'til Shakespeare got a hold of it (circa 1594) and breathed into it the life that will last as long as humanity does most probably.<br />  This towers over the 1st film version with a 34-year-old Norma Shearer and a 43-year-old Leslie Howard, and as for the 1996 mess sorry guys; American accents, present day gang violence, over-the-top overacting, LA locales, and Leonard DiCaprio do not great Shakespearean tragedy make.

B00006CXXU|3.0|I thought Christina Aguilera said that she's moved on from that bubble gum pop sound to her OWN sound?  Obviously not because I hear so many songs that sound like Pink's and Mariah Carey's.  One of Christina's interludes sound exactly like Mariah's.  What is up with that \\"Make Over\\" song?  I totally hated it.  It sounded like something from the 70's and honey, this ain't the 70's.  Aside from all that, she does have a nice voice and shows it on a lot of the ballads.  I hate her music videos.
B00000IBVC|3.0|The sets, the costumes and the dancing were indeed amazing. The singing was also quite good, but the singers (with the exception of Liu) did not seem very engaged in the story. The staging added to this impression. I believe the stage director was attempting to emulate Chinese theater by making the movement stylized, but I don't think that was a good idea with this opera. Turandot and Calaf are difficult to like under any conditions and in this production they didn't even seem human. This DVD is well worth seeing for the sets, the costumes, the dancing, and Liu's wonderful death scene, but if you only intend to own one version I recommend instead the version with Eva Marton as Turandot and Placido Domingo as Calaf. They almost make it seem that the main characters deserved their happy ending.

0451163540|4.0|One of Follett's first spy-thrillers - Triple - is a typical cat and mouse spy novel, which is characterized by many dynamic characters all of which play a big and even role in the plot. From all ends of the political and religious spectrum - Follett introduces various characters right in the beginning of the novel with an unlikely meeting of future foes. The story begins at Oxford University in London England, where a group of students participate in political discussions. What they don't know is that their political differences will some day become more than just political differences. Eventually they'll all be at different ends of the race for nuclear weapons in the mid-East. <br />I enjoyed the novel profoundly. It was a very good weekend page-turner, and I would suggest it to anyone who admires Follett's work. The reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because I've read more recent work of his including the Key to Rebecca, the Pillars of the Earth, and A Dangerous Fortune - All three much deserving of 5 stars. Although a great novel, I still must limit Triple to 4 stars because it's not quite on the level of entertainment as those aforementioned. The writing style of Follett is unique and he produces great stories with awesome skill. If you have not read those three novels I've mentioned, please take time to read them. You'll be incredibly entertained if you were to read any of them - with my personal favorite being The Pillars of the Earth.
B00004TL21|4.0|The Deftones experiment a bit on White Pony, the results?...well a bit of a mixed bag really. Fortunately the good songs outweigh the bad. This seems to be one of those albums where i like the songs most other reviewers dislike, and vice versa.<br />Feiticeira - A lot of people don't like this song much, i think it's one of the best on the album. Very haunting and original sound. Nice story of a kidnapping.  <br />Digital bath - Everyone loves this one, i have to agree. Very melodic and atmospheric song with some nice guitar work. Chino really shows his vocal range.<br />Elite - Probably my least favorite song on the album. Lots of heavy repetitive riffing, chino screams like a robot. Gets tired after the first 30 seconds.<br />RX Queen - Kind of a love song with spy music and the drums have a cool echoey effect. Don't care much for the chorus though. Still an interesting listen. <br />Steet Carp - Probably the most straight forward song on the album. Just your typical Deftones rocker that wouldn't sound out of place on Around the Fur. Not great but not bad either.<br />Teenager - Completely different to anything the Deftones have ever done. Very mellow Trip Hoppy song with gentle strumming of guitar. Might take a few listens to get into, but will be a rewarding listen. <br />Knife Prty - Awesome song. Nice quiet little intro then the guitars hit you with a bang. Incredible bridge with some soothing female background vocals, which turns into screaming towards the end. <br />Korea - Next to Elite the heaviest song on the album with some over the top riffing that sounds like Korn on steroids. The bridge has a nice groove to it. Average song. <br />Passenger - Brilliant duet with Maynard James Keenan. Very dark, haunting song with some awesome guitar work. I love the lyrics on this one. <br />Change (in the house of flies) - Another awesome song. The Deftones really show how they've progressed as song writers. Heavy and melodic with superb lyrics and a catchy chorus. <br />Pink Maggit - I don't know if i like this song. The intro is really long and builds up, but the rest of the song isn't that interesting. There's a nice guitar hook, but it's played into the ground by the end. <br />Overall i was really impressed with White Pony, they've gone for atmosphere and melody rather than just ham-fisted numetal riffage. The next album should be great.

I admit after I read the first couple chapters I felt sick to my stomache and had to rest before I began reading again.  The authour paints these vivid images of the characters happenings, some of them you don't want to think about.  Alice Sebold has depicted imagery of heaven in such a believing way.  This story is undoubtfully wonderful.

I personally had a joygasm listening to this. My favorite tracks being Demonic Refusal and Murky waters.  The dual chanting vocals definatly adds to the mood of the album.  Don't get me wrong, there are only a few death metal albums that are really decent out there, but testament did a fine job with the death vocals.  Gene Hoglan's drumming could have been more inventive though

The acting was superb, the scenery was beautiful, and the entire movie left me so awestruck that it was all I could talk about for days.  Even if you have not previously seen or read The Fellowship of the Ring, this movie will be incredibly enjoyable.

It was so good that I could harldy put it down. You will just fall in love with all the characters.  This is a wonderful novel that I reccommend to everyone.  Sophie Kinsella creates an amazing story and gives a remarkable book to lift your spirits!!!
0385504209|4.0|I heard a 'blirp' about this book on NPR and there was enough intrigue to draw me in. From the first page you hit the ground running. Brown reminds you of the things you may have learned in Art 101 and then peels back several more layers and all the things you have taken for granted and places a well defined meaning on them. Math IS everywhere. The full scale scavanger hunt kept me up late two nights in a row. He is kind enough at the end to inlude the reader in the scavanger hunt as you develop the character of riddle maker you are able to guess ahead of the main character and feel a part of the story. From a Christain stand point it questions the very beginnings of what you have been taught to believe. The book is a well crafted novel with enough truth included to make it almost a historical trip back through time. A highly recommended quick read that you find your self thinking about days later and as one other reviewer put it; 'worth the second read' for the fine points.
0316666343|3.0|I was very eager to read 'The Lovely Bones' after hearing the critics label it a modern-classic.  As another victim of hype, I was letdown.  The angle of this book is its biggest redeeming quality.  The narrator in the novel tells her story from heaven.  The writing, not the most poetic, is good.  And I was never, ever bored with the book--the pacing's good.  But aside from the father, there really never was a character I truly cared about.  A decent read, but nowhere near the area of modern-classic.
B00008NRI7|4.0|I love this movie. Sandra Bullock and Hugh Grant was a dynamic duo. But the real star is Alicia Witt even though she underplayed in this movie She is great as the best friend. Don't buy this movie if you expecting Noting Hill. But do buy if you want a movie that good and fun to watch.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|If you liked Heathers, Brazil, or Edward Scissorhands, you will love this movie.  The entire cast is fantastic (except for Drew Barrymore, but we can forgive her since she executive produced the movie), the soundtrack is wonderful, the effects are beautiful for a movie that didn't cost much by Hollywood standards to make.  This is a cult fave in the making.<br />I have found that 20-30 somethings love this movie; but people from our parents' generation do not get it, just as they don't get the other movies I listed above.<br />There are plot holes and other imperfections, but overall this movie is a revelation.  Do yourself a favor and buy/rent it now!
B00005JKJA|5.0|There's already an abundance of praise and befuddlement over this film, but I just had to thrown in my vote. I won't go as far as to say it's a masterpiece, but it is an unforgetable and extremely watchable film. Some of the acting in the first half (the made-for-TV part) is a bit rigid, but it's appropriate given the overall \\"campiness\\" element. Naomi Watts is incredible throughout, and all the curveballs and comic relief characters are absolutely classic! This is a David Lynch film after all, so if you don't enjoy the absurd, and have no interest in dream logic, then of course you'll be disappointed. The review by srklemow below, has a pretty good explaination of the \\"real story\\" but you can probably figure it out on your own. As FBI Agent Dale Cooper said long ago: \\"My dream is a code; break the code- and solve the mystery\\" Well said, Coop!
B00005JKPF|5.0|I cannot think of a better word to describe this movie. I have seen plenty of sequels in my life, but X2 goes beyond great.<BR>One of the best things about this movie was the use of multiple XMen and thier powers. <BR>1. Storm summoning multiple tornados in an air fight sequence.<BR>2. Rogue using her powers to help calm a fire set by Pyro.<BR>3. Pyro using his powers to drive away the police.<BR>4. One of my favorite scenes is with Siryn. The \\"troops\\" break into the mansion and barge into her room. She sits up and activates her sonic scream (those who read the comics know what her power entails). Coming to her rescue is Colossus. He walks into her room and his body transformers into all metal-COOL.<BR>5. Professor X freezing the entire mall.<BR>6. The \\"near the closing\\" scene of Jean Grey and the water.<BR>Of course there is a great story behind all of this. An attack on the president (by the newest mutant Nightcrawler) causes a \\"rogue\\" military man to seek vengence on the mutants, specifically Professor X. <BR>There is also the intertwining of Wolverine's past which became a little clearer. <BR>There were some excellent fight scenes and tremendously eye popping special effects. <BR>Another great thing is the character development. We are introduced into the past of Nightcrawler, Wolverine and Iceman (Bobby Drake). We touched on a little more of Storm's hatred of humans. There is the spark of romance and betrayal. <BR>We also meet another human experiment with the adamentium; but this time just her \\"nails\\". <BR>Mystique is a pivotal player in the movie this time and I was glad. She has become one of my favorites.<BR>Also cleverily placed throughout the movie are subliminal \\"X's\\". I found a few.<BR>I also liked the idea of expanding the use of thier powers. XMen like Jean Grey, Storm and Wolverine.<BR>There was also some subtle hints of things to come. During a t.v. interview we meet Dr. Hank McCoy (Beast). While breaking into some computer files, Mystique came across a few names including Remy L. (Gambit). A big scene with Kitty Pride or Shadowcat. Another mention of Jubilee and the boy who can change the t.v. without using a remote. <BR>I will be seeing this movie again, again and again. This is completely worth the money.<BR>Besides the end scene with Jean Grey left a big opening for a sequel.<BR>I LOVE THE XMEN.
B00000099Y|5.0|Tool. I often overlook this band. For some strange reason, even though I see all 4 of their CDs all the time in my CD wallet, I always seem to put something else on. Strange, you think? But the truth is...maybe it's just because of my own immaturity.<br />Because Aenima is not a CD you can just skip around and find songs you like. You need to put it on, sit down, and listen to the whole thing very thoroughly. And everytime you hear it, you need to deciper the messages to get the full experience of this CD. I haven't decipered all of them yet, and I never may get all of them. But the beauty of it all is that each and every time you hear it...something is different. You notice something in the music that you really didn't notice. That's how complex the songs are.<br />I'm going to end my review here. This short review should be plenty to make you go get it. Pick a room, turn up the volume, and just listen.
B0000640VO|4.0|I'm generally not a fan of romances, but this movie is really cute and well-made without being too sappy.  For instance I cannot stand &quot;You've Got Mail&quot; and have almost no patience for &quot;When Harry Met Sally&quot; but I can watch this without gagging.<br />This is a French movie with subtitles so those of you with aversions to the French and/or subtitles should skip this one.<br />Amelie is a young French waitress who tries to secretly improve the lives of others (through all kinds of kooky schemes), but her own love life is nonexistent.  Until she encounters a young man with a strange obsession for collecting discarded photos from photo booths.<br />Overall this is a very nice movie; however Amelie struck me as a little too &quot;stalkerly&quot; in her machinations to help other people.  Otherwise anyone who likes movies about odd people finding true love should enjoy this one.  The cinematography and overall style of the movie are quite good.
B00005QB9A|5.0|I enjoyed this movie SO MUCH !!  I am indeed a romantic, I am also a piano player, and the playing was so wonderful!   I feel sorry for [name], a reviewer, he did not get much out of the movie, indeed, went the other way in his feelings.  That's really sad, as there is so much to be enjoyed here.  Like anything else, it depends on one's outlook on life, and one's attitude.  The emotions and the actors' depictions of them in this movie are just marvelous.   Anyone that says the scenes are more or less \\"sappy\\" must be very jaded, to say the least.  This is a movie to be watched when relaxed and not be critical.
0316096199|5.0|Gripping read.  Helps you understand the true and continual pain of rape survivors.
B00000IPAX|3.0|I have never liked Blink 182. Anyone who knows me will tell you that I wouldn't be caught at a Blink 182 concert if my life depended on it. I hate Dude Ranch, Cheshire Cat...and I particularly despise Take Off Your Pants and Jacket. But for some reason, when I first heard this CD, I caught on to it. Sure, it wasn't great, but there were some catchy songs that weren't half bad. So I did the unthinkable...and bought this CD.<br />It never really got a lot of play from me. But when it did, I listened to maybe 3 or 4 of the songs, and enjoyed them. &quot;Don't Leave Me&quot;, &quot;Going Away to College&quot;, &quot;What's My Age Again&quot;, and &quot;Wendy Clear&quot; are all outstanding pop songs. Thank goodness though, those are the only good ones on the CD. Everything else on the CD is what I hate about every other Blink 182 CDs; poor lyrics, poor musicianship, and just face it...they aren't funny.<br />But every once in a while, when I'm all alone, I'll put that on softly and enjoy the 4 songs. Hey, everyone can have a guilty pleasure, right?
0684833395|5.0|\\"My military experience was beneficial and enjoyable, almost entirely. Even those last missions when I was scared stiff became a rich experience because they were suspense. It was not boring.\\"(Joseph Heller)  Heller's experience is part of what enriched Catch-22's exceptional portrayal of World War II and Yossarian.  Catch-22 was meant as a classic from the time it was published.  Describing the corruption of society through the main character's, Yossarian's, experience in World War II.  The in-depth analysis of peoples' view of gain for only themselves made Catch-22 destined for success from the very beginning.  <BR>The story is that of a bomber pilot, Yossarian, who endures the hardships of fighting the war.  He must deal with the superior offices constantly raising the required number of missions each man must fly to be sent home whenever he is close to release.  He must also live with the men in his squadron dying left and right which is his greatest let-down.<BR>But, finally he has a chance to escape.  After flying 71 missions and seeing all his friends die in combat he refuses to fly.  This invokes a deal from his commanding officers since he is causing such a problem among the rest of the men fighting.  All he must do is like his commanding officers and he can be sent home a hero.  Yossarian agrees to this but deep down he disapproves.  As he walks off though he is stabbed and is brought to the hospital where he discovers his only surviving friend is in Sweden.  He then sets his mind to leave his troubles and find his friend, Orr, in Sweden.  <BR>Catch-22 is a terrific work for how it unmasks the corruption of society.  Constantly, Yossarian notices the people around him seeking their own personal gain.  Colonel Cathcart, raises the number of missions, endangering and enraging his own men, just to make his squadron look good.  Milo, the mess hall officer, is always making deals on the black market and even goes to the length of bombing his own men to make some money. At the conclusion of the book, when Major Danby cried, \\"Jump!' Yossarian jumped. Nately's whore was hiding just outside the door.  The knife came down, missing him by inches, and he took off.\\"(463)  When Yossarian jumped he obeyed his instincts which showed a change in his attitude toward the world in the rest of the book.<BR>This book is excellent for the revealing of peoples' intentions.  The numerous encounters with corruption Yossarian experienced made this reviewer think how many of those similar situations exist today.  After reading Catch-22 it is a wonder how this society does not fall apart though the vivid explanations the book puts out for the readers.  Now, however, this reader has gained a greater appreciation for analyzing the situations he comes across.
B00006GEXQ|5.0|I like watching Hugh Grant onscreen - raffish and intellectual and slightly off beat and the trailers and excellent reviews conviced me to see this movie. And it was worth it.<BR>However --- it was billed and presented as some form of romantic comedy but it really is &quot;About a Boy&quot;. I would say that the true star of the movie is Nicholas Hoult. The gist of the movie is given elsewhere in these pages so I won't bore with a repetition but Rachel Weisz only gets around 15 minutes of screen time and Toni Colletes nutty mother early on is removed as a romantic interest.<BR> The real relationship here is all between Grant and Hoult with Hoult providing the driving force. His loping walk, strong stare and stunningly innocent smile are played to perfection and demonstrate both his need to find his place in the world and to drag his mother along with him. He forces Grant to accept him, forces him to face himself and is transformed in the process. Hoult takes an almost tragic figure and gives him life, humor and grace. Hugh Grant is good too.<BR>This is a movie to feel good too.
0783231032|3.0|I am impressed with the extras on this 1941 DVD.<BR>It has good interviews in a long making of documentary,it has outtakes and is the directors cut with extra scenes. But why would they go to all this effort and not make it anamorphic? That would have improved the picture quality which is very disappointing.
B000001Y5J|5.0|Most definately one of the best. If you've ever been mad at the world with a hatred that can't be localized then this is the CD for you. Although annoying you have to put up with all those silent tracks all the songs are good. I think Reznor just wanted to experiment with what he could do with a CD. I think Gave Up is the best song on the CD and I would have liked to see more remixes of it. But still the popularity of this CD in the mainstream was based on the Wish video.
B0000797IO|3.0|This movie has received so much attention that it is really hard to rate. Jennifer Aniston does manage to shake off the cloak of Rachel which is a good thing as she had become stuck in a rut but I wouldn't say that it was Oscar worthy, although there are some good moments, usually when she is in close up.<BR>Aniston plays Justine, a clerk at Retail Rodeo who is bored to tears with her life and her stoner husband Phil. She is attracted to Holden, a new cashier who is depressed, younger and claims to be a frustrated writer. The movie revolves around their affair, the way Justine feels that she is becoming &quot;bad&quot; and the decisions she makes in her attempt to become &quot;good&quot; again.<BR>It is a comedy, and this is done to make the tragedy appear more real, the most comedic parts being Anistons narration which is in excellent deadpan, and some of the peripheral characters, especially Zooey Deschanels bored clerk.<BR>The biggest problem I have is in Justines relationships. John C. Reilly is great as her husband but you can't see how they ended up together in the first place and because you don't care about their relationship until the end, you don't care about her having an affair either. I had trouble sensing any spark between her and Holden either, he is so depressed and depressing I can't see where any passion could have arisen. It is easier to imagine them getting drunk together and passing out. The directors did say that Justine was written as more stupid than Aniston played her and maybe that caused the disconnect. The performances are all good so maybe it is the writing or direction. It just seems that this movie came really close but just missed hitting the spot.
B00000AOUD|5.0|considero este album ente los escogidos por varias razones:a)musicalmente es perfecto,b)a pesar de se una sola canci, no se hace monotona,c)la letra es sumamente original y con algo ms que el topico 'te quiero' tan manido en la historia de rock.d)es un disco que se puede escuchar varias veces seguidas sin cansar. en fin una joya.
B00006JJ1O|2.0|i really liked the song &quot;all the things she said&quot; but the rest of the album is mostly average stuff, the album would need a few more number 1 hits songs to be classified as grammy award material,this album doesn't have the capability. I wouldn't recommend buying this album unless your a fan of tatu, otherwise get the single of &quot;all the things she said&quot; instead.
B00005JKCH|4.0|This blockbuster was good but one thing really struck me- there really are two movies here. The first one is how geeky Peter Parker is bitten by a spider and develops super powers. This part is great, really funny and original and Tobey McGuire is exceptional.<BR>The second is your standard comic book action flick, which is good, filled with action, great set design and all the rest but I felt dropped down a notch from the first half.<BR>All of the supporting cast is great with one particular nod to James Franco as Parkers best friend and son of Spideys arch nemesis - he really pulls off the inadequete rich boy to a tee and I hope he will be in the sequel.
B000002UAU|5.0|este disco es del 67. Y esta escogido como el mejor de la historia del pop como el nmero uno. Ninguna objecin, slo decir al que no lo haya escuchado que lo haga con rapidez para poder comprender mejor la evolucin de la msica pop hasta ahora.De este album derivan la mayoria de los gneros existenetes hoy en da en el mercado.
B00003CXXM|5.0|A man is found floating in the sea near death. He has been shot twice and has a laser implanted in his hip with the number of a Swiss bank account. He doesn't remember his name or who he is. Slowly however he discovers that he has skills. And oh boy does he have SKILLS.<br />The gist of the movie is described by others on this page so I will avoid repetition. However the reasons I like this movie are as follows:<br /> Matt Damon as Jason Bourne is cool calm and collected. I never would have pegged him for an action star but he carries his role admirably. You feel his confusion, his surprise and his disgust when he finds out who he is. He is also the calmest and most professional spy/protagonist I have seen in a long time.<BR> <BR>The charaters modus operandii is refreshingly different. He reads a map to escape from a building, and values precision and speed over haste and unnessesary force (read hails of bullets).<br /> The female lead (Franke Potente rocks) is a solid individual. Most Hollywood action female leads are as follows; Screaming Ninny, Brave Toughy, or Spunky Girl. Here we have none of that, she is afraid but overcomes it, listens to directions, accepts her mistakes and provides a refreshing counterpoint to Damons paranoid spy, sometimes solving problems more simply and clearly than he can.<br /> The action sequences are fast moving and original with no unneccesary gunshots.<br /> The car chase is physically possible.<br /> Humor is sweet and not overdone.<br /> Peripheral characters are fleshed out enough to be interesting but not too much to distract from the main story.<br />In a nutshell. I found this movie treated me like an intelligent viewer rather that following a formula but without becoming \\"arty\\" and trying too hard.

0156027321|5.0|Life of Pi is a nearly perfect book.  It is literary, but it is fun.  It is a riveting story, but it contains elements of religion, philosophy, zoology, and biology.  Once I had begun to read the story of Pi, I found it very difficult to put this book down.  It is not a short book, but I read it in a little more than a day.  I won't go into a story summary, since that is available in many reviews.  Just read it.

B00006ADFL|5.0|I watched this film because I enjoyed FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING and TWO TOWERS and think that Peter Jackson is a talented director.  I wanted to see more of his work in another genre.<br />HEAVENLY CREATURES is a wonderful and complex film.  Jackson (and cowriter Fran Walsh) takes what could be a salacious story (homosexuality, sex, and murder) and makes an amazingly surreal and touching film.  After the shootings in Columbine and other dastardly acts - including the two real-life New Zealand girls who are the subject of this story - Jackson gets into the state of mind of the youth.  The two New Zealand girls (played by Kate Winslet and Melanie Lynskey) are too consumed by their fantasy world to know right from wrong.  They are young and confused and their best recourse is their imaginations (incredible sequences with life-size clay people!).<br />Jackson has created a very theatrical world in HEAVENLY CREATURES.  There are some hilarious filmatic references (including some funny bits about Orson Wells).  The characters are complex, though.  Jackson and Walsh made me understand WHY the girls chose to do what they did -- which doesn't make it right.  But the film makes no moral judgment (which I appreciate!), it only tells the girls' story.<br />The DVD looks very good, with an excellent transfer of the film (although I noticed some scratches running down the right side of the frame in the early scenes!).  <br />I'm glad I finally saw HEAVENLY CREATURES.  I'm convinced Peter Jackson is one of our best directors around.
B00004T9VY|5.0|otro de los pocos discos perfectos del principio hasta el final, No le sobra ni una coma. Todas las canciones son cinco estrellas.El lirismo de este album  es inigualable en la historia del pop.
B00008OLYN|4.0|Opeth have leaped to the top of the metal genre and appear to no end in sight.  (As we all know metal fans can be a overly critical when a band decides to play with it's sound)  Only being at the top could they release an album such as this. With their seventh album \\"Damnation\\"  they have decided to make an album that is devoide of distorted guitars.  What made Opeth unique in the first place was their use of these moments within the heaveir sound.  And most people will agree that it is their softer moments that stick out.  This album loses some of that energy (that is why I only gave it 4 stars), but is no less brilliant.  This is still a metal band at heart and the lyrics are focused on death, loss and feelings of isolation.  This is definately a band that can play their instruments, and their expertise shines on these songs.  A gorgeous piece of work and a metal album my girlfriend enjoys more than me.  Get it.
B000000OAN|5.0|que se puede decir de este disco que no se haya dicho. Lo tiene todo.Un vocalista excelente, un guitarra superior, unos coros de lo mejor. Y una variedad de temas slo al alcance de los ms virtuosos. En resumen un merecido 10
B00005JKPF|2.0|ok i was excited about this film, i bought tickets early, got to the theature early. I was excited to see night crawler who was the best charecter in this lame movie. He is the reason i gave it a 2 becuase  i used to use him as a character in an old xmen game for sega genesis. The reason i gave it a bad rating was becuase it was so boring. I sat their in my seat wishing for more action, but it never came, just constant talking. This had less action than star Trek Nemesis did. It was bad becuase there was no action, not alot of fighting scenes. In total, about 5-10min of fighting seens, the rest is either talking, arguing or flying their ship. I thought it would have more action then the first one, but i was wrong. This movie was truely boring and a waste of my money.

B00005RY7X|5.0|...all the tracks on Andrew W.K.'s latest album, I Get Wet and all I can say is \\"WOW!\\".  This album is filled with the kind of songs that just make you want to jump up and down, sing, shout, dance, and just plain feel good about yourself.  I actually declared his song \\"We Want Fun\\" from the soundtrack of the film Jackass as the official Summer Anthem song!  Andrew W.K. is without a doubt the ultimate writer of anthems!<br />The album kicks off with \\"It's Time To Party\\".  I've heard a lot of songs played at parties but this song should definitely be the one that kicks everything off!  It's also a good song to play while preparing the party as well. \\"IN YOUR FACE!\\"<br />\\"Party Hard\\" has a very eerie beginning but then turns into an all-out party anthem filled with guitars, drums, keyboards, and vocals.  A great big rebellion on people who are all about keeping the peace and remaining silent.  A great lyric in the song is \\"We do what we like and we like what we do!\\"<br />\\"Girls Own Love\\" starts off with some good keyboard and drums followed by a slam of voices and guitars.  A good tale of what to do and what not to do in relationships.  Be good to your lady guys! \\"You don't stop when girls own love!\\"  <br />\\"Ready To Die\\" is a song that reminded me of something that definitely came out of Jackass.  A good song to play when you're hanging out with a bunch of your closest friends.  Watch out 'cause Andrew W.K.'s coming for ya!  \\"We made a sacrifice and now we get to take your life!\\"<br />\\"Take It Off\\" is a great fast paced song that sounds like it came right out of a park concert.  Just picture a massive crowd of people just mosh pitting all over the place.  Great for just moving yourself all over the place ripping your clothes off!  \\"Forever never, take it off!\\"<br />\\"I Love NYC\\" is a song that is perfect for the people of America to hear and should have definitely been played at the Concert for NY in 2001.  I can definitely see Andrew W.K. playing this song in CentralPark and just having a huge crowd of people bang their heads in time with the song and wave around a bunch of lighters in spirit of the World Trade Center.  \\"You can't stop what you can't end!\\"<br />\\"She Is Beautiful\\" is a nice song with plenty of guitar riffs and drum hits.  It's a nice punk rock tribute to all girls of the world.  \\"The only thing I live for in the whole wide world!  She is beautiful she is beautiful, the girl is beautiful!\\"<br />\\"Party Til You Puke\\" is another great party anthem that encourages all listeners to go completely crazy at any party inside or outside!  \\"We're not gonna die! You can never kill us!\\"<br />\\"Fun Night\\" is hard hitting song that tells people that even if there are a ton of bad things going on in the world, you can still manage to have a good time for yourself and your friends.  \\"There ain't no hurry 'cause there ain't no worry!\\"<br />The song \\"Got To Do It\\" is the ultimate 'motivation' anthem that is perfect for helping people look on the bright side of things and just get up and start doing something that really makes them feel good.  \\"Heads held high, never gonna die, 'cause we gotta keep it alive!\\"<br />\\"I Get Wet\\" has a great mighty beginning that segues into a hard hitting crowd driving anthem for just having fun.  Like \\"We Want Fun\\", this song just rebels against everything and tells people that whatever happens, we'll always wind up having a good time.  \\"Watch what I do because I really don't care, you're never gonna throw away, I get wet!\\"<br />\\"Don't Stop Living in the Red\\" is a great ending to the album.  It is just a message from the artist telling people to always have fun with whatever they do, and never be worried about consequences.  \\"Ohhhhhh ohhhhhhhhhh RED RED RED RED RED RED RED!\\"

B00005JKPF|5.0|This is the way a sequel should be made!  You build on the original and take it to the next level.  Everything here is great, with cameos from several X-Men and surprises throughout the film.  My only gripe is the fact that Gambit wasn't in this anywhere!  Colossus had only about a 5-second part where he was metal, although he did manage a good few minutes as human. Please bring him back in the next film with a bigger part - and bring Gambit in there too PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE! All in all, this is an incredible movie, and it sets itself up perfectly for the final film in the trilogy (the actors are signed for 3 films, and it's doubtful you could get all of them back for any more so enjoy this cast while it lasts). Nightcrawler's part in the film is amazing, and they truly bring him to life as you'd imagine him from the comic books. The teleporting effect is awesome, and the opening minutes of the film will leave you breathless! It totally changed my opinion of Nightcrawler from the comics because I'd always seen him as one of the weaker characters...now I see that he has the potential to be one of the deadliest! Wolverine gets a ton of screen time, and it's nice to see Iceman use his powers (but let's see him turn to ice in the next film like he does in the comics). This movie stays incredibly close to the comics as far as characterization goes, so true fans should be pleased.  Cyclops doesn't get much screen time at all (but being such a stick-in-the-mud character, who really misses him?), but he's obviously going to play a major role in the next one. Hopefully, the final film will have a few key things to make it perfect: Nightcrawler in a cool uniform rather than the circus clothes he wore throughout this one, Iceman TRULY becoming his namesake (the special effects are there, so don't say it can't be done), Gambit (complete with staff, cards, and overcoat), more screen time for Colossus and Kitty Pryde (she's been in both movies so far for a few seconds, so go ahead and give her some serious screen time), and finally, the return of ALL the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants (including their new recruit from this film). Get ready for number three to blow you away if this one is any indication of it. This one blows the first one out of the water, so plan on watching it again and again!  Get out there and see it!d and give her some serious screen time), and finally, the return of ALL the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants (including their new recruit from this film). Get ready for number three to blow you away if this one is any indication of it. This one blows the first one out of the water, so plan on watching it again and again!  Get out there and see it!
B000002UKS|5.0|As Dave grohl brought together his new band after the breakup of nirvana, there were natural comparisons and ties between the newly formed fighters of foo and the grunge gods nirvana. Listening to the first album this might even have been warrented to say that grohl's new band was just a nirvana wanna be.<br />Critisisms aside, the band created a great first album, and followed it up with this album, &quot;colour and the shape&quot;. While the first album didn't seem diverse enough in my opinion, and their newer albums can lean too far towards the pop scene at times, this album is a must own classic cd. From the powerful and catchy singles, to the slow heartfelt ballads (most of which move from soft mellodic lines, to heartbleeding screams, under the skilled vocalizations of Dave grohl) this cd contains the strong rock presance and the diverse blend of songs to fill in the gaps that are present in some other foo fighter albums.<br />An essential cd.
B00005JKPF|4.0|Wow! Having enjoyed X-Men thoroughly, I was pleasantly surprised to see that its sequel, X2, was actually better! Now, the only thing stopping me from a full 5 stars is the fact that the plot is simplistic and rehashed from similar movies. You know the type - bad guys (once good) were wronged by the good guys and now seeks ultimate revenge. Had the plot been more original, it would boost the score one notch. Then again, it's based on a comic book series so how deep can it really get? I feel no particular need to explain the story as it's been done thoroughly by other reviewers and I never like to divulge the story line or it spoils it for the rest.<br />However, having said that, I was so impressed with the characterization, acting, and special effects. The latter was amongst the best I've viewed bar none, particularly for the genre. It totally makes up for the lack of originality in the plot.<br />Do yourself a favor, whether you are a die-hard comic book fan or a person who tends to dislike sci-fi or action movies, this flick will not disappoint! See it on the big screen. After being awed, purchase the DVD when it comes out. I plan to do so!
B000000W6F|5.0|If you are a rabid pumpkins fan, then yes, go ahead and buy this if you don't already have it; it is a good pumpkins album and important for any collection.<br />if you are a random music fan, or smashing pumpkin fan of non-rabid status, I would advise finding a way to preview some of the album first (through download or a friend's copy or whatever). While most of the songs are strong musically, they are more psychadelic than rock, with more of an 80's new wave than a 90's alternative rock. <br />The album's singles are strong and provacative, such as &quot;I am one&quot;, and the slow burning ballad rocker &quot;rhinocerous&quot;, and most of the other songs are at least decent, more than just filler.<br />I would recommend this album to those with an open mind who have heard other SP albums and are ready to explore more of the band, but if you are new to the band and prefer 90's alternative rock, I would strongly suggest their second album &quot;Siamese dream&quot; instead.<br />This is a good album, but perhaps one of the last I would buy from this band.
B005J9ZE5I|5.0|Evil Dead II isn't horror movie.<br /><br />It's not scary because you get to see there's often no ceilings on the set dressings.  Ted Raimi's costume comes apart in the finale.  The prosthetics are shiny as plastic.  The blood comes in just about every color EXCEPT red.  And Ash is too cheer inducing to really feel any fear.  While made on a limited budget, Evil Dead II is essentially the biggest budget movie of a bunch of friends messing around with a camera and fake blood.  How is that not awesome?<br /><br />I don't know how many times I've seen Evil Dead II, but it never gets old.  There's a real sense of creativity among all the rough effects and missing set panels.  The blistering trademark Raimi editing and camera work may have never before or since seen so much invention.  It's really easy to make a mean spirited story about a bunch of teenagers getting mauled to pieces out in the woods.  No matter how graphic you could make the violence, it's just been done to death, so to speak.  Adding in the three stooges touch and Bruce's hilarious \\"reverse motion acting\\" makes this movie what it is - a labor of love and fun.<br /><br />Evil Dead II is the epitome of what's missing in nearly every \\"horror\\" film made in the past 70 years:  heart.  I've never seen a movie where you root so hard for the main character and jump on for the ride of what was obviously a lot of fun for the people behind the camera.  While Evil Dead 1 is darker and Army of Darkness is funnier, Evil Dead II hits a mix no other movie has ever been able to get close to.<br /><br />Hail to the King Baby.<br /><br />Excellent transfer considering it's age, budget and some of the limited optical effects. Also, hilarious crew commentary is still in place from my old DVD.  One of the most entertaining you'll ever hear.
B00008NRI8|2.0|Let's be honest this is as [weak] a comedy as you can imagine but having said that, Hugh Grant is funny, even with this script and Sandra Bullock is cute.  I would never recommend you actually buy this but a rental on an evening when you IQ are asleep and there is nothing else on, then it is okay.

Different from Mystic River but well worth the wait. You have an unique ability to keep one on the edge of their seats. Looking forward to future works from you. Whomever the master of your mind, keep up the great work. Twisted ....
B00008S2VG|1.0|in an attempt to sound fresh and reinvented, madonna just tried too hard here.  too much self-commentary that wasn't done in a very interesting or unique manner.  i found myself skipping to the next song every time i got irritated- which was A LOT!  and pretty soon the CD was over.  and so is my interest in this CD...
B000002UTT|5.0|This is a great album and was the first huge album by the sensational Swedish duo.<br />The album cover insert has all the song lyrics on the back and a newspaper called The Daily Roxette on the front. It tells you of Roxette's adventures, travels, their behind the scenes people, all as news paper hard news style stories.  Also has some 50's style advertisements within, using song titles from this album.<br /><br />This album is still worth owning if you own the Don't Bore Us Get to the Chorus greatest hits album, as the songs which appear on both are different versions on each.  The other songs on here are pretty good too.<br /><br />The Look is of course one of the greatest songs of all time.  It used to be my favourite song was I was in primary school back in 1989 and I still love it.  It's one of the only Roxette songs where Per, (the guy) is the lead singer.  Dressed for Success is another sensational song and you'll often here it being played in the background of news reports of catwalks and fashion shows.<br /><br />Sleeping Single I'm pretty sure wasn't released and is a great song with a good drum beat in the background about a girl waiting for her guy to come back and prepared to sleep by herself until he does.<br /><br />Paint is an excellent fast 80's sounding song.  Not really about paint for home renovators wanting a song about that, except that is about painting your love all over town.  A great song.  Dance Away a fast 80's dance style song is one that isn't too dated today.  The lyrics are well written.<br /><br />Cry is a slow paced love song similar style to Listen to Your Heart but completely different lyrics and music. Basically a girl asking why she should cry over you (well not you specifically but some guy she likes). Chances is another fast sensational song about a girl wanting a guy to take a chance on her.<br /><br />Dangerous is of course one of the classics and was a hit single.  It's a sensational fast song with a good beat.  About a girl a guy is attracted to being dangerous.  Per sings the guys voice with Marie singing the girl's response.<br /><br />Half a Woman, Half a Shadow is about a girl who is sad therefore half a shadow.  Another really good song.  View from a Hill is another terrific 80's pop sounding song.  I Could Never give You Up has a nice Mediterranean piano sound throughout as well as a consistent drum beat.<br /><br />Shadow of A Doubt has a similar start to Europe's Final Countdown song before the da da diii doo part beings. Shadow of A Doubt becomes more original as the lyrics begin.  It's a nice song to have playing in the background.  Listen to Your Heart is one of the best love songs of all time.<br /><br />You should definitely buy this album.ice with Marie singing the girl's response.

B00008CLOA|5.0|WOW... This is all I can say....EVERY member of Floyd had input and heard this album.  Not only are David Gilmour and Roger Waters [wetting] their pants on how great it sounds, but Nick Mason and Rick Wright have both said this is DSOM.  This is what DSOM was supposed to be.    First off, David wanted to use 1st generation tapes because A) 3rd generation tapes hid a lot of the music, and B) it sounds EXACTLY how every band member wanted it in the first place!.  The stereo mix is supposed to match the quality of the original vinyl recording, and it surpasses it heavily....in their 25 min EMI DSOM 30th anniversary promo video they cut the whole album apart, with interviews from this year!  All 4 guys agreeing on how outstanding this album is....    ...Roger, Rock, Nick and David...all agree DSOM is better than ever!  Not only that but Roger Waters gave a listen to the 5.1 mix and loved it.  He says that not only does it sound great but it's something that has never been tried (Other than the Quadraphonic record which was a failure)    Most people don't sit around to pick away at music, because not only is it not their own, but how can you say what's right and what's wrong?...Not only that but some members had said they never listened to DSOM, but this makes them actually like hearing it all the way through.    I think anyone who is new or old to The Floyd should definitely buy this right away.  Not only does it show you what DSOM could have been in the beginning, it takes you through the best musical journey of a lifetime.    If you don't already own Dark Side, or you have an old Vinyl or CD version, the 30th Anniversary is worth it.
B00000273M|5.0|The Bangles were probably the biggest all female rock band of all time.  It's a shame there aren't really any female rock bands today.  You have lots of great female artists of course but no rock bands.  In the 80's the Bangles made some gems and they're all on here.<br />The album insert tells you some history of the band and which songs were their first hits, biggest hits, how they formed stuff like that.  My main criticism of this insert is that there are no lyrics.<br />Of course the three huge hits Manic Monday, Walk Like an Egyptian and Eternal Flame are still played frequently on the radio but its good to be able to play them whenever you want.<br />Hero takes a fall and Going Down to Liverpool are pretty similar music wise and great songs.<br />Manic Monday about being depressed at the start of the working week and wishing it was the weekend is sensational.  If She Knew What She Wants has a good drum beat in the background with lyrics about a guy not knowing what his girl wants and if he did he would give it to her.<br />Who didn't Walk Like An Egyptian when this song was released.  This song has an excellent beat and solo whistling tune.  You've had The Ketchup Song, Macarena and other songs by other artists try and be clever dance numbers but they were never as good as this song.<br />Walking Down Your Street is a fast paced song with simultaneous singing in chorus by the members of the ground making an excellent sound.<br />Following is a fairly slow song with a guitar being the main thing heard during the song.  It's not one of my favourites.<br />Hazy Shade of Winter is a seasonal Christmas sounding song (not about Christmas) that sounds pretty good.<br />In Your Room is another fast paced song with a good drum beat throughout with good guitar sounds.<br />Eternal Flame is of course one of the classic love songs of all times.  It has been redone by other artists but no where near as well as the Bangle's sound.<br />Be With You is a country sounding song with a fast beat.  The ooooooooohhhhhh sound is heard in a lot of the words especially songs title ones be with you.<br />I'll Set You Free is another great song has great guitar sounds at the start then a heavy drum beat.  In chorus singing by the band again at the chorus makes this song great.<br />Everything I Wanted has the words Ohhh Ohhhh Oooooohhhhhhhhh repeatedly sung before the title words.  It's not a bad song and is fairly fast.<br />The last song Where Were You When I Needed You is bit too American country music sounding for me.<br />This is a great album.  Buy it if you don't have any of their other albums with the big three songs.  If you have those I wouldn't bother.song with a fast beat.

B000069HK2|5.0|Okay, I'm exaggerating, but really, this is an incredible CD.  &quot;On My Own,&quot; &quot;Blue and Yellow,&quot; and &quot;Noise and Kisses&quot; are my favorites, but there isn't a song on it that I don't enjoy on some level.  They do the screaming thing very well. Five thousand stars.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|I love this music and the fact that they are hot russian lesbian teens makes me like them even better! Of course &quot;singing russian teen lesbians&quot; sounds like so much spam I get these days.<br />Anyhoo - the album is great - the Russsian language versions are very interesting. The ladies voices are high pitched but catchy -combined with pop hooks that will reel you in for sure. The backgrounds are layered, harmonic and complex - not your typical club drek.<br />Many of the songs are addictive and will ring in your head for days after listening - particularly &quot;All the things she said&quot; running through your head, running through your head - like a hypnotic suggestion.
B00008NRI7|3.0|Summary:<BR>Lucy Kelson (Sandra Bullock) is a Harvard educated lawyer who, instead of chasing big money, is interested in stopping big money (especially Wade Industries) from wreaking havoc on decrepit architectural masterpieces.  When George Wade (Hugh Grant), part owner of Wade Industries or Development or something like that, loses another beautiful but incompetent lawyer after having hired her simply to sleep with her, he hits upon the idea of hiring Lucy when she approaches him about saving a building that his company is planning on destroying.  Lucy agrees to be hired but only because she is 'convinced' that if she actually is working for the people that have all of the money that she will be able to do more good than by just fighting them.  <br />Once on board Lucy and George develop a strange but humorous (for the audience anyway) relationship, but it is remarkably taxing on Lucy who eventually decides that it is just too much.  She finally convinces George to let her go, but when her replacement, June Carter (Alicia Witt), comes aboard the romantic relationship that had been developing between George and Lucy but had not been verbalized comes to a head.  On top of this, George is being pressured by his brother, Howard Wade (David Haig), who is the real brains behind the company, to destroy the building they had originally promised not to destroy in agreement for Lucy coming to work with them.  Now George and Lucy must wrestle with their morals and their emotions to decide the best course of action.<br />My Comments:<BR>Is it wrong for a man to enjoy Hugh Grant's performances?  I mean, there is no romantic attraction, I just think the guy has good comedic presentation.  Sandra Bullock on the other hand, well, she wasn't horrible in this, but it wouldn't have been a comedy if it weren't for Hugh Grant.  He is funny.  And the writer's of the movie do a great job of giving him good material to work with.<br />The story is pretty much a typical romantic comedy recipe, but it does have some memorable moments, for instance, at one point George and Lucy chase down a motor home in rush hour traffic so Lucy can use the toilet - can't recall that ever being done before (and it probably won't be done again).  The rest of the cast, well, yes, there are some other people, but they play such remarkably insignificant roles that they aren't really even worth mentioning.  The movie knows what its strong points are - Grant and Bullock - and screen time is about 99.9% them.<br />Overall, if you enjoy Hugh Grant's sense of humor, this is just as good as, say, Notting Hill or About a Boy (though I'm sure people would argue that Sandra Bullock doesn't compare to Julia Roberts but I don't know that it matters because in both cases Hugh Grant is the funny one, not the female actresses).  I would definitely recommend this as a date movie or for fans of Hugh Grant.
B00006CXXU|5.0|Leave all preconceived notions of Christina behind... this CD is definitely different than her past work.  I only knew of her from MTV & radio play, and wasn't a fan.  Then I heard \\"Loving me for me\\" and \\"Impossible\\" and was blown away.  Amazing voice.
0316666343|5.0|I found this book incredibly touching; it truly broke my heart.  Alice Sebold's writing, even while describing horrific events, is haunting and lyrical.  I identified and empathized with every character and felt like I was leaving friends when I finished the novel.  I look forward to reading many more works by this gifted author.
B000002HH2|5.0|When and how did it happen?  When did a rock and roll purest like me get into Bjork.  For me, it started at the end.  While riding in a car with a buddy of mine I got my first taste of Bjork.  Vespertine had just come out (yeah, I started listening to her a little late, but better late than never) and I was love struck immediately after hearing the first few notes.  Bjork has opened a door for me into a hole new world of music that I did'nt know existed; or that I had just chosen to ignore.  Post is Bjork at her best.  Everytime I listen to this CD I take away something new that I had'nt noticed before.  It is a cure for the blues a shot of prozac a euphoric high that can't be explained.  It takes you on a trip and when it's over your glad you went.  If you like Bjork and for some reason you don't own this album buy it.  And if you have never listened to Bjork and want to start then this is the best place, but beware once you've made that leap there is no turning back.  She will open your eyes to a world you may not know existed.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|There are only a handful of bad reviews on this movie, but they are quite irritating to read.  This movie is a masterpiece, and unlike just about EVERYTHING that comes out in the theaters these days, this kind of movie has never been done before.  Your common everyday meat head movie-goer isn't going to like it because its meaning is not instantly accessible.  Oh no!!  You actually have to THINK about this movie for awhile after you watch it to try to form an opinion on it!  Movies like this don't always go over well because the mass pop culture can be very stupid.  But believe me, to write this movie off because it is \\"confusing\\" is ignorant and closed minded.  Well, enough ... bashing.  What about the movie itself. <br />Casting was perfect.  Nothing but good performances.  The style in which this movie was filmed is just beyond description.  The more you watch the movie, and the more your mind lets you see things come together, the more amazing the filming becomes.  I can't say too much because I'll give things away.  (Yes, there actually is a plot and a meaning.  Just don't expect Vin ... Diesel to come on screen and tell you exactly what it is.)  And the icing on the cake is the music.  This movie was made to look and sound like it takes place in the 80's, but the whole eighties feel is very subtle.  Almost as if they went to the trouble of doing things to let you know it takes place in the late eighties, even though it doesn't really matter too much.  <br />Anyway, I could go on and on.  See this movie.  It's one of a kind.  I actually suggest buying the DVD instead of renting it, because you will most likely need to see it more than once.  If you want to see a TRULY confusing movie that has no meaning or validity, go see Malibu's Most Wanted at the local theater.
B00003CXI1|4.0|This movie is pretty good, but makes some people lean more by the \\"Harry Potter is Kiddy and Stupid\\" quote. The actors are okay, but the people who play Fred, George, and Dumbldore are just not right for the part. The boys who play Fred and George just make the two seem like goggling dorks. And Dumbledore, who is supposed to be jolly, energetic, and a bit on the mad side, is tired, not even half a happy face's jolly, and too serious. Also, Harry can be a bit flawed as an actor in SOME parts, but he is okay in most parts. Ron, Hermione, Snape, Quirell, Flitwick, McGonagoll, Wood, Neville, Dudley, Malfoy, Mr. and Mrs. Dursley, Hagrid, Nearly Headless Nick, and Percy are great for the roles they play, however. The special effects are good too. They may leave out some parts that are in the book, but I still think it is a great movie that most fans of the book will enjoy, unlike the games...
B000063DFQ|2.0|This album is completely overrated.     Iron Maiden was an incredibly powerful and exciting band while emerging during the early '80s. However, when great drummer Clive Burr left after 1982's Beast on the Road Tour the true heavy metal magic of the band totally dissipated. Notwithstanding, the band had attained enough momentum to become huge afterwards (commercially speaking). Maiden's brilliant preceeding album Number Of The Beast opened the door for success, no matter what kind of album would follow it... and a real bad one came along.    Piece Of Mind is an overrated showcase of washed-up heavy metal riffs, theatrics, goofy lyrics and screaming cliches. The compositions and drum patterns are very repetitive and boring. The music style became monotonous and more predictable ever since the release of this album. For a strange reason, though, most fans really bought into the new Maiden despite the fact that lazy live performances were night and day compared to Maiden's highly energetic concerts during their beginning. With Piece of Mind, Iron Maiden became more of a commercial product rather than a real heavy metal band. The band had lost their hunger, and sold out!    With commercial success finally at hand, even Dickinson's live singing paled compared to what he had originally delivered in The Beast. Subsequent albums Powerslave and Somewhere in Time are a much better improvement. Weird, but... am I the only Iron Maiden fan who feels this way? maybe so...     \\"If you're gonna die... die with your boots on\\". Indeed.
B00005JL78|5.0|I don't exactly want to write about this movie, so I'll just say it's a must have.
B000063DFS|4.0|I bought this album a few weeks ago and immediately was hooked on the album. The Prince of Darkness, Ozzy is at his best work ever. It definately beats his previous albums by a landslide. Writing the songs with Lemmy from Moterhead made Ozzy's music way more better and unified than anything ever heard before. This album also featured Ozzy's new guitarist Zakk Wylde who did an unbelievable job on the riffs. Some of Ozzy's all-time greatest hits came out of this album.<br />The opener, &quot;Mr. Tinkertrain&quot; is a very strong heavy metal tune with excellent guitar riffs, a very catchy beat and a GREAT job on the vocal talents by Ozzy. This a pure MASTERPIECE. The ballad of the album, &quot;Mama, I'm Comin' Home,&quot; is OZZY'S GREATEST SONG EVER!! I am HOOKED ON THIS SONG!! It is Ozzy's all-time greatest ballad ever. This song shows a whole other side of him we have never seen before. Ozzy and Lemmy did a outstanding collaboration together on this one. This is one of Heavy Metal's greatest albums done. The song is an A+!!<br />Then solid rocker, &quot;S.I.N.&quot; is really catchy and real loud. Great lyrics, great beats. Another somewhat-slow tune is &quot;Time After Time&quot; which is one the album's best tunes. The closer, &quot;Party With The Animals&quot; is such a fast tune and so HEAVY on guitar riffs. It's definately another great Ozzy anthem.<br />The album overall definately earns it's 4 out of 5 stars. Buy this Ozzy album and you will have &quot;No More Tears&quot;.
B00005JKCH|5.0|This movie is another one of the must-sees on my huge list. The story is amazing and dramatic. There is tons of action. The plot may be a bit simple, but it is epic and will have you on the edge of your seat. After you see this, I assure you, you won't be able to bear the long wait for Spider-Man 2!
B00008DDXC|5.0|Excellent follow up to the first film!  Can't wait for the next.
B00001U0DP|5.0|This movie is simply a masterpiece. The story of an Italian-Jew, his wife, and his young son during the Holucost, the husband trying to keep his son calm in a consintration camp by saying it is all a game and that the winner gets a tank. This beautiful tale about a man's love and devotion to his son will have you on the edge of your seat as you experience its romance, comedy, action, and drama. This is a must-see for anyone who owns a DVD player or a VCR. Wonderful. It fully deserves the awards that it has won.

044022425X|2.0|... and his absence killed it.  When I read the first book in this series, A Dragonfly in Amber, I was happily suprised that it wasn't a run-of-the-mill, formulaic romance.  The characters were shockingly three-dimensional and the antagonist was, well, a bad guy with a face behind the black moustache, so to speak.  <br />Well, sequels have been disappointing, not least Drums of Autumn.  Brianna has the personality of a  paperdoll compared to her mother, and unfortunately a great deal of the book revolves around her.  Likewise, her love interest is only slightly more charismatic.  <br />In summary, don't miss the first book of this series but don't bother with the rest.

B00005JKPF|5.0|It's a rarity for a sequel to be as good as the original.  It's even rarer for it to surpass its predecessor.  And that's exactly what X2 does and then some.  X2 is way better than X-Men (2000) in every regard.  The plot, the direction, the acting, the characters and their depth, the 'cool' factor (way HIGH), and the FX are all superb.<br />X2 is definitely the best and most ambitious comicbook based film ever.  It would be virtually flawless if that was it.  However, X2 also is one of the best Sci-Fi/action/thrillers.  Returning director Bryan Singer has taken several character and not only made them unique in their special attributes but also in their motivations, their depth, and their personalities.  Several new characters are introduced and the returning characters are given even more shining moments.<br />As you can tell, I haven't described even the most cursory plot details and that's because I want every first time viewer to enjoy this movie like I did without having anything spoiled for me.<br />All in all, X2 is now THE peak which future comicbook based films would have to reach.  Rating: 10/10
0451163540|5.0|Ken Follett once again writes an incredibly compelling novel.  \\"Triple\\" begins at protagonist Nat Dickstein's release from the concentration camps, and goes ahead to 1968.  Of three groups - Dickstein representing Israel, as well as spies from the KGB and Egypt - who will ultimately wind up with the uranium to build a nuclear weapon?<br />The way Follett recreates history, the book COULD be true.  He does a marvelous job, even when the point of view goes from one spy to another.  This is NOT a \\"light read\\" but it's intriguing... captivating... and worth your time.
B000002B7O|5.0|This album along with Blizzard of Ozz is a must have for all Ozzy/Black Sabbath fans. Although Diary of a Madman doesn't get as many rave reviews as Blizzard of Ozz, it may be the stronger album. Randy Rhoads' guitar playing was clearly growing more toward classical playing, particularly on the title track. Very strong selection of songs such as \\"Over the Mountain\\", \\"Little Dolls\\" and \\"Flying High Again.\\" The very underrated \\"You Can't Kill Rock and Roll\\" may be the best of his slower tracks. The lesser known tracks such as \\"Believer\\" and \\"S.A.T.O.\\" are strong as well. There's no filler here unlike many of the albums he made after this. It's a shame Randy passed on, as it would have been interesting to see where they could have gone after this.

This time, she teamed up with some new musicians and some old friends, like Wayne Shorter (great as ever) and Herbie Hancock plus the London Symphony Orchestra and Choir, arranged by Vince Mendoza, who with this work has reached the Olympus of great arrangers (check out Heijra!). 22 songs, this means the listener is bound to have favorites. All, however, are produced with utmost attention and care and all sound completely up-to-date. Those who have followed Joni through the years will notice that her soprano has dropped to a comfortable alto range. With Joni, one not only dives into a very unique world of sound but also of words - the lyrics are poems, and what a relief to listen to some serious lyrics! <BR>Im sure that some fans from the old days will have trouble to get accustomed to these arrangements of songs, some of which were performed only with a guitar at first time. My favorites are plenty, but I really enjoy You Dream Flat Tires, Slouching Towards Bethlehem, The Sire Of Sorrow, For The Roses, Trouble Child, Be Cool, Sex Kills, Heijra, Cherokee Louise, Borderline and The Circle Game. Joni Mitchell said upon the release that Travelogue would be her last LP: lets hope that that was said out of frustration for not being recognized for what she is: one of the very few truly original artists of our time. With Travelogue, her art sounds quite alive, and so Im looking forward to more Joni in the future.
0441172717|5.0|Dune is an amazing book. Even though it was written in the 1960's it is still a solid sci-fi book.  This is the first book I have read that made me want to grab a highlight at highlight certian passages. Granted, the first fifty pages are the hardest, but after you get used to the language it runs smoothly. Frank Herbert is not afraid to kill off main charaters either(something more authors should do). Forget about the terrible movies and take a ride to Arkeen, just be wary because you will want to read the rest of the series.
B000028U0Y|5.0|This was my personal audio introduction to the great Johnny Cash.  I listened to it on headphones while I raked my yard of leaves.  If someone was watching me, I'm sure I was seen laughing out loud, playing my rake like an electric guitar, and pausing to listen carefully to the touching gospel songs.  I consider myself fortunate to have been introduced to Johnny Cash through his Folsum Prison album.  It is easily one of his best efforts and the fact that it is recorded live makes you feel like you are there in the audience listening to Cash, hearing his deep rich baritone, hearing him cough and clear his throat after songs, and visualizing the expressive and appreciative audience all around.<br />This is Cash at his best.  There is not one song that drags or you wish to skip over.  One song flows into another with narratives and audience reactions and interactions.  It is a true treat to hear how the prisoners react to the songs Cash preformed just for them, songs of despair, songs of prison life, funny songs, and touching gospel songs.  It's all here and its so well done, it leaves you shouting with the prisoners for more when the performance concludes. How I wish I could get this performance on video!<br />I have to also highly recommend Cash's other live prison album, San Quentin.  There are many new and different songs, and once again, the live performance injects an energy and vitality that has to be heard to be appreciated.  The two live prison albums are absolute MUSTS for Cash fans.<br />Before closing, mention has to be made of Cash's band and backup vocals.  The band is as lively a band as can be; the electric guitar playing of Carl and Luther Perkins is absolutely fantastic and infectious, and the same is true of W.S. Holland on drums.  June Carter and the Carter family are a delight.  June's duet with Johnny in the song &quot;Jackson&quot; is priceless.  One can only imagine the facial expressions of the two as they banter back and forth in the lyrics of this song!  June Cater's voice is especially pleasing and she can belt out a song with as much power and personality as her husband Johnny Cash.<br />After hearing this album, you'll want more of Johnny Cash, and fortunately for his music fans, there is plenty out there that will appeal to you.<br />Jim Koenig (Konedog4)ics of this song!

B00008DDXC|3.0|This was a great movie and in many ways superior to the first in the series - however the film has very little re-play value. I got the DVD and quickly popped it in my DVD player looking to recapture the magic of that day when I saw it in the theater and was disappointed. Having not read the books I had no clue about the story when I sat down in that darken theater - so as the simplistic (yet more complex than the first) plot unfolded I was entertained and impressed. However once you know the story the movie has very little to offer. The DVD set is nice and is more inclusive than the first, it also looks nice next to the first film on my shelf and I'm afraid it's going to stay there for awhile, perhaps I'll watch it again when part three comes out.
B00005JKQZ|2.0|Despite all the great reviews, I must say that, while I was<BR>hooked at the beginning of the movie, I slowly drifted into confusion.  It was difficult for me to distinguish fantasy <BR>against reality, and so about maybe a third of the ways <BR>I couldn't understand who/what the heck the government agent<BR>was and why he and the little girl kept on appearing and reappearing before Crowe's eyes.  It was just very confusing<BR>to me and thus wasn't satisfied with this movie.
B000000WJK|5.0|I first heard &quot;Slide Away&quot; on the soundtrack of an obscure movie called &quot;The New Age&quot; (well worth a look, BTW).  Obsessed,I scrutinuzed the end credits until I could make out the name of the band and rushed to my used record store and bought A Storm in Heaven.  I was stunned, mesmerized, lost in a state of reverberating bliss.  I could not stop playing this disc, and it has remained my favorite rock record for 8 years.  Among the reviews here, I've noticed a similar trend -- listeners who were so captivated that they played this disc every day for years.  <br />Some rock is beautiful, some rock is powerful -- but this album achieves a fusion of beauty and power like no other I have heard.<br />Listen to it at 2 AM, on a good stereo, very, very loud -- or soak it up in on a midnight drive through the moonlit desert.  You will be forever changed.
B00004STPT|4.0|When I first bought this CD I thought I heard a cheap copy of Holst's \\"Mars, the Bringer of War\\" with a little Charles Ives & Mahler added in. Why not use the real Holst theme? Did it not fit certain scenes or was the timing off? The composer Hans Zimmer must be trying to capture the essence or ideal of using the style of these musical themes rather than giving us a classical recording of them. Therefore the classical section is the weakness of this CD, but the haunting beautiful universal language of Lisa Gerrand with the mysterious dudak playing of Dijivan Gasparryan is its strength. Both of these fine artists capture the tragedy of this life & the freedom of death. To reunite humanity in harmony with the one's you love most. The last song \\"Now We Are Free\\" explains it all.

0060278250|5.0|on my frequent trips to the book store, i had often considered buying 'sabriel' but never did until about a month ago. the minute i finished, i was back at the store to pick up 'lirael' and 'abhorsen'. all three of these books were exceptional, and though 'lirael' and 'abhorsen' gave the impression of being two sections of the same book, so smooth was the transition from one to the other, i must say 'abhorsen' was by far and wide the best. <BR>if you want a synopsis of the plot, read the back of the book. why i am writing this is to tell you how much i strongly recommend this novel, especially for anyone who enjoys fantasy. people say this about books a lot, but i honestly felt that the characters were real. i cared what happened to them. i even cried at a few points (and trust me, ive read so much this does not often happen)and i was actually shocked at some points (ditto). the language was powerful and evocative, and this book concluded the trilogy excellently, it was everything the infamous \\"last book\\" in a series should be.<BR> <BR>              (on a more serious note:)<BR>HOWEVER: there better be another one, because though this does not seem to be the case, there needs to be!!!!! i dislike cliffhangers and hints!!!! that is cruelty to us on the authors part and it is not very kind to be left wondering!!!!<br />sorry, i had to get that out.

B00005JLSE|5.0|I really Enjoyed Chicago it put me in a really good mood it made you forget about your troubles for a while. The music was fantastic as were all the cast. If your in the mood for something light and bubbly see Chicago it won't dissapoint.
B000002LK1|5.0|I really don't have much experience in the way of Depeche Mode. My first introduction into their world was Dream On when it came out as a single a couple of years ago. But as my interest in different music expanded exponentionally over the years, I decided to give Depeche Mode a try. Violator was my first full on listen of any Depeche Mode and I'm grateful that I did listen to it because there is not a bad song on this.<br />Widely claimed to be Depeche Mode's dance album, Violator is still gem to listen to. Drenched in gloom, Violator seems to follow themes of lovelorn, loneliness, disapointment and longing. There really isn't happy song on the album at all. But to surround the despare are tight, incredibly melodic arrangements of synth, guitar and percussion. Beautifully arranged and perfectly accentuating the music to further complement the dark lyrics. But even beyond that, the music is still propelled by a strong rythm that is most certainly dance floor friendly(especially the classic Enjoy The Silience).<br />Its a deep, rich, emotional experience that's worth revisiting thanks to quality musicianship and stellar song writing. Though most will pawn it off as just another 80s sounding synthpop band, some will realize the dark beauty that is Depeche Mode's Violator.
B00005QZ7U|1.0|Being a fan of musicals this dissapointed me greatly the lack of a good script and songs made it sink to the level of badness it achieved. The performances were good but the faults were too strong to see the good factors of the movie. Not worth your time at all.
B00008PW3Q|4.0|There are undoubtedly some great moments on this CD that stand up to anything the Mac put out in their heyday. Unfortunately, there's a lot of junk here, too. With the increased capacity of CDs, band are now putting out the equivalent of what would have been double albums back in the old days. How many double albums do you know that didn't have at least some filler? Even the Beatles' White Album had plenty of that, along with \\"Tusk\\" by the Mac, and now this effort.<br />So, let's get rid of the junk and keep the good stuff. Here are the keepers:<BR>What's the World Coming To (strong opening, shows a little global consciousness like several songs on this CD.)<BR>Thrown Down<BR>Miranda<BR>Say You Will (catchiest song on the CD, but, man, Stevie's voice is almost a baritone on this one)<BR>Peacekeeper<BR>Running Through the Garden<BR>Steal Your Heart Away<BR>Bleed to Love Her<BR>Destiny Rules<br />That's nine songs. Now, add about three or four from Christine (a studio version of \\"Temporary One\\" included, which, in my opinion, was the best new song on \\"The Dance\\") and this CD could have been a knockout.<br />Suggestion for Fleetwood Mac: For the next album, gather everyone who has ever been in the group (like Yes did on one album) and have a big blowout. Bring back Peter Green, Jeremy Spencer (OK, that won't happen), Danny Kirwan, Christine, of course, Bob Welch, Billy Burnette, Rick Vito, Dave Mason, Becca Bramlett (bet you didn't know those last two were temporary Maccers) and have a big super Fleetwood Mac jam session. If \\"Albatross\\" was great with three guitars, imagine \\"Albatross 2005\\" with eight!!
B00008S2VG|1.0|I've never had much of an opinion of Madonna. I've never been a huge fan, but I've never been opposed to her. I did enjoy \\"Ray of Light\\" (the album more than the song), but I personally thought that the song \\"Music\\" was one of the dumbest songs I'd ever heard. The funny thing is, it's my genre she's touching. I love electronica ----, as my friends would refer to it. Moby, Chemical Brothers, Daft Punk, et cetera...the list goes on as to the reasons why this kind of music would work for me, but \\"Music\\" rubbed me the wrong way. And dang it if \\"American Life\\" didn't rub me the wrong way with steel wool.<br />Madonna, I know you're talented. I've seen your videos. \\"Frozen\\" is one of my favorite songs. But what is this? First of all, I don't know how you can act like you're being introspective. The titular single \\"American Life\\" has themes that we've been hearing for years. Nothing new is touched upon. If you're trying to make a statement on the state of the nation, you're doing a very poor job of it. System of a Down made a better video, Bruce Springsteen spoke out, and all you can do is make a song where you don't say anything that 60's folk songs haven't said? Unless you're listening to the Oakenfold remix, it's not even worth the time.<br />However, the real thing that gets to me is the dj'ing of this album. I\\"m not going to begin to make guesses as to who is behind it (but I do think it wouldn't take much more than a decent Casio to pull it off). \\"Die Another Day\\" is an atrocious track that ruined the best James Bond opening made to date. Track 3 is in the same vein, and it's not any better. In fact, the only electronic track which comes out sounding particularly decent is \\"Hollywood,\\" and I can say good things about it only in the same way I can make good comments around Bernie Goetz when he's surrounded by Ted Bundy and Jeffrey Dahmer.<br />I know you're always reinventing yourself, but honestly, I don't think going against the Material Girl image works for you, especially when you're worth more than I'll ever make in my lifetime. Maybe you have other plans for the album that I don't know of. If I could see another \\"Nothing Really Matters\\"-style video for \\"Nothing Fails\\" (the best track on this album, imo), I might be able to regain my respect for you. But, honestly, in a career full of \\"Sex\\" books and \\"Erotica\\" videos, it's kinda bothersome that this album is the most offensive thing you've produced.pecially when you're worth more than I'll ever make in my lifetime.

B00001U0DP|3.0|La Vita e Bella (Roberto Benigni, 1997)<br />Roberto Benigni finally gets out from under the blanket that is Jim Jarmusch (Benigni and Jarmusch teamed for such cult classics as Down by Law and Night on Earth) in America. It should have been obvious for anyone who followed both men that Jarmusch's humor is of a decidedly different sweep than is Benigni's. After all, Benigni released the silly, rather stupid Johnny Stecchino the same year Jarmusch released Night on Earth, with Benigni as one of the cab drivers. Where Jarmusch is intellectual, Benigni is slapstick, often painfully so.<br />To Benigni's credit, La Vita e Bella is his best film. (By far.) He tones down the slapstick quite a bit, though he's as manic as ever. Here, he plays the kind of guy everyone knows, the inveterate liar who uses his talents for storytelling to try and make life better for everyone around him. He gets his big test during World War II; as he is Jewish, both he and his son are taken to a concentration camp, where he spends his time trying to convince his son that they're playing a game rather than trying to keep themselves alive in the face of Nazi oppression.<br />It's impossible not to like the film, really. But I think much of the credit should go to the supporting cast rather than Benigni, who's as annoying as ever. (At least he's not playing with bananas this time a la Johnny Stecchino.) Everyone around him, rather than seeming grateful for his actions, seems to take them with an almost resigned amusement; in other words, every other actor in the movie is set up as a straight man for Benigni and his wild flights of fantasy. The effect is wonderful.<br />There is much to be made of the light tone taken with the Holocaust, and the hundreds of coincidences throughout the latter half of the movie that would have made it impossible, but we must remember: this is Benigni. His character's wild flights of fantasy are nothing more than a mirror of Benigni's own wild flight of fantasy in the structure and content of the film itself. Still, the juxtaposition of manic comedy with the horrors of war (most starkly shown when Benigni gets lost in the fog after the dinner) does leave something of a bad aftertaste in the mouth.<br />Overall, though, a good film. Worthy of the Oscar nominations? Maybe. Benigni winning Best Actor over Edward Norton in American History X? Not even close. ***structure and content of the film itself.

B00005JLSC|5.0|Wow what a movie totally blew me away. The film just captivates you from beginning to end a truly great movie with fantastic music fantastic performances and production so high it makes Moulin Rouge look like a pantomine. A Must See
B0000009RT|4.0|this is one of the most important rock albums of the 1960's. The Mothers were so &quot;ahead of their time&quot; (the title of another of their albums.......if you are into listening to something truly original, then this is the album for you.  And if you like early Mothers of Invention, then get this album then buy the &quot;Mystery Disc&quot; CD.  This is not Top 40 stuff, rather it is an encapsulation of the times.  Frank Zappa was truly a genius and I, for one, miss his music, both old and new.
B0000640VO|4.0|When adorable Amelie does her good work and mischief with Paris as her movie set, well, for heavens sake, how can this slightly nutsy film be anything but a hit with foriegn film enthusiasts? Actess Audrey Tautou is delightful as the effervescent Amelie, projecting an Audrey Hepburn radiance but with far fewer inhibitions. You really have to love Paris to keep up with the wierd plot. Nevertheless, sticking it out is worth the time spent becasue the ending brings all that comes before it into bright focus. This fun movie also helped me to brush up on my French language skills, even though, I cheated and used the English sub-titles offered on the DVD. This film probably would not have worked with just any city backdrop, but in Paris, almost anything is believable.  Good characters, strange plot, but Amelie fixes it all for the good, making this interesting viewing.
B00008NRI7|2.0|I love both these actors, and they're both likeable and cute.  But this movie was a dog.  Firstly, the plot was very different than the feel of the movie you got from the trailer.  Secondly, Ms. Bullock once again plays a soppy loser who orders chinese take-out night after night alone.  Despite being a highly successful lawyer, her character comes across as a total loser with no confidence, just a fruity greenpeace nut. This is so disappointing when Sandra Bullock could be so much more.  Why does she return to these rolls over and over again?  <BR>Third, George and Lucy had no spark or chemistry.  There was no love story here, just funny little scenes stuck together.  The ending was very boring.  They should have shown the wedding, except that Lucy's bridal getup was horrendously ugly!  She looks like her name should be Agnes or something.  See Sliding Doors instead with Gwyneth Paltrow, that was cute.

B000069HKH|4.0|Well, what a return to form from the E-Street Band and Bruce !<br />In the &quot;old days&quot;, this would be released as a double vinyl. In the CD era, Bruce released 15 new songs (FIFTEEN!!) in over 73 minutes of music. Of course, when you release so much new material, things sometimes get a little bit irregular in the quality department, or tend to be boring sometimes.<br />But that's not the case here. The music sounds fresh and,except for one or two tunes that I did not like, I found the album to be exceptionally enjoyable. I prefer the rockers, but the slow ones are also magnificent here. MARY'S PLACE reminded me of the Bruce from the past, from THE RIVER days...The opener LONESOME DAY was a wise choice to start this tour de force. NOTHING MAN was the best slow one, in my humble opinion.<br />As for the E-Street Band, man, they are as good as ever! The other line-up that Bruce hired for some time (Jeff Porcaro on drums, Randy Jackson on bass and keeping Roy Bittan on keyboards)was alla bout highly skilled professional musicians, but it simply did not possess the spark that the E-Street band had after playing for years together, beginning in small venues and changing into football stadium: the typical &quot;CInderella&quot; history of a successfull rock band.<br />Unfortunately, Bruce has never played in my country, and probably never will. His records are released here, but the style of his lyrics and music does not appeal to the Brazilian people.
B00006F7S4|5.0|Before this album i was never a huge beck fan. I liked some of his stuff, but alot of it was just kinda stupid to me. But this album really expored what he can do as an artist, and he churned out some really beautiful songs. the musicanship is outstanding. Justin Jason Mendel is one of my favorite bassists, and chosing the flaming lips as a opening band and backing band was a brilliant idea! if this is a new direction for beck, i'll keep my ears open. but now i'm finding some of his old stuff isn't too bad! this album defninitly made me a fan.
B00008WT5C|5.0|Why did they include Problem Child instead of Crabsody in Blue? Problem Child was already released on Dirty Deeds in remastered form. The only reason it was ever put on Let There Be Rock was because Dirty Deeds wasn't released in the U.S. until 1981, so Problem Child was thrown on Let there Be Rock instead of Crabsody in Blue. They should have included it on the re-remastered release here. Oh, well...this album rocks anyway.
B00005JLEU|5.0|Those who claim that this spectacular work of art is too 'weird' or too 'confusing' really need to get their heads checked. They obviously need an imagination or two in order to appreciate this film. Chihiro's development from a sulky, complainsome girl into a strong-willed and friendly young woman is something that's amazing itself. Unlike most Disney films, Spirited Away has lots more than just one message in the film, and each one is more deeper than you'd think. For instance, I had explain to my MOTHER what all the junk and stuff spilling out from the Stink Spirit meant!<BR>I know a few people who dislike the whole thing with Kaonashi(No-Face) and the train trip. First of all, the whole deal with No-Face was that he wanted to enter Chihiro's heart, but he thought he could do it by offering her gold. He was just lonely; which was also the theme for the trip to the Sixth Station. All those faceless 'shadow people' looked like they were lonely too, and that whole scene with the little faceless girl watching the train pass by really gripped my heart for some reason. Combined with Joe Hisashi's beautifull orchestrated score, the scene, I think, was one of the best parts in the movie.<BR>As many have said before me, the PG rating is there for a reason. Hello, doesn't the 'Some Scary Moments' tag ring a bell?<BR>Those parents should view this film first if they're that concerned about the content, and also, they shouldn't just dismiss this as a children's film; it can be enjoyed by anyone.<BR>This is anime at its best, people.<BR>Everybody who's remotely interested in GOOD cinema should see this at least once.
B00000K19E|1.0|For a fiction to work out well- it would have to be proportionally realistic with its plot's structure. This movie fails to level that way with its story. For a try-hard sci-fi flick that tried hard to carry its plot with a bunch of far fetch scientifical explanations, still it was never able to resist on going its way to incorporate the element of fantasy to its story- in this case dealing with prophetical predicaments within its storyline surprisingly, that it doesn't fit well with its already preposterous script, which borrows heavily from the doctrines of Buddhist teachings - giving a ridiculous effect in the result ; and as if it weren't enough, they also borrowed heavily from Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs!<br />Filled with bad acting and bad action choreography sequences- sure this movie may have some great overbloated special fx, but they are even all blown out of proportion at times, unnecessarily with its scenes perhaps except only for the purpose of showing off. Just recently last week i've watched X-MEN 2 on the cinema, and among the most previous films to have come out it's such that is a well made enough film to use impressive and inane type of 90's fx married well with its scenes coherent to the storyline, unlike this cacophony hogwash of a movie. If you're looking for science fiction with solid plot structure, go for them classic 70's sci-fi's like SOYLENT GREEN and The OMEGA MAN (both starring Charlton Heston) + the original PLANET OF THE APES (w/c still stands well with its satirical social commentary, unlike its remake which is completely washed out of any substance from the original siries, and is nothing but a deliberately commercialized attempt to cash in with the dime-a-dozen sci-fi movies of the past few years (quite a mojor disappointment considering that it's a film by Tim Burton)), and the Stanley Kubrick film epic of Arthur C. Clarke's 2001:A SPACE ODYSSEY. And for a sci-fi flick that goes well of its mixture with fantasy elements-- no one could go wrong with George Lucas' classic trilogy of the original STAR WARS, for the most familliar so to speak...<br />I'm a major fan of the sci-fi/fantasy genre myself, but for me this pretensious hack goes down to the gutter with the now forgotten fad of the X-FILES...<br />I wouldn't nary give a hoot about its couple of sequels now showing in the cinemas. So bumb this review - i don't care.<br />Rate: 1 1/2 out 5 - for the special-effects.
B00008DDXC|5.0|I must admit even , after the first part Harry Potters - The Socerers Stone, I was very impressed with the story line. I must admit, I have refrained from reading the book  so I can enjoy the movie, and I have to admit I dont regret not reading the book a bit. Harry Potter, meets up with his old friends and the movie begins with many unexpected swirls and turns. The movie, not even for a moment stops for a breather, the action and suspence in the plot is what, keeps audiance in thier seats. This movie, is worth keeping in your DVD collection and so is its predecessor, as it is one the whole family will enjoy.
068484267X|5.0|Angela's Ashes is by far one of the most touching novels you will ever read. Once I picked it up, I could not put it down. It keeps you on your toes, and you wonder what's going to happen next? It's innocent and sweet. You see the story through the eyes of young Frank McCourt, where he takes you through journey's, some sad, some uplifting. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys reading true stories that come from the heart.

But there's much more to it than that. <br />The movie is roughly 207 minutes, but the time will pass so quick it will seem like only 30 minutes. And you'll get to see the legendary Toshiro Mifune, one of the greatest actors of all time.<br />Rating - A+++++++++++
B000068FUS|2.0|What we have here is barely passable southern bar rock, and not much more. While the Drive-By Truckers can play competently, there simply is not much to write home about on this double-disc set, and I was ultimately very let down after hearing so much hype and reading so many reviews calling this stuff \\"genius\\" and a \\"masterpiece\\". <BR>Patterson Hood can sing with conviction, but his voice lacks a certain edge which would give him some much-needed individuality.<BR>And I would have to say that the stigma associated with being from Athens, Georgia has probably been the cause of him being pegged as some kind of savant folk hero, when he is probably just an average Joe with a guitar.<BR>I'm not saying this is bad music; I can put it on and not hear anything that makes me want to take it off immediately. It's just nowhere near as special as past reviews have made it sound. This CD easily could have been stripped down to one disc and it would not have made a difference; the \\"opera\\" and \\"story\\" on the album have no new light to shed on anything, least of all Lynyrd Skynyrd, and I doubt anyone is buying it to find some sort of enlightenment.

This is not another review of one of my horror flicks.  This is simply a thriller...non-stop from start to finish.  It's sci-fi theme is so subtle, you really don't feel like it's unreal.<br /><br />If you liked \\"Natural Born Killers\\", \\"The Salton Sea\\", \\"Blow\\", and other riveting classics, this one's for you.  How can you go wrong with a cast like this?<br /><br />It stars Ralph Fiennes.  Ralph, who is also the Red Dragon in last year's three-quel of \\"Silence of the Lambs\\", smuggles SQUIDS.  What are SQUIDS?  As you know, I don't give away plots.  Let me just say that Ralph is \\"the Santa Claus of the subconscious\\" and peddles real-life cerebral clips (I'll leave it at that).<br /><br />He's joined by Juliette Lewis, who starred in \\"Natural Born Killers\\" and is just as dynamic in her role as a rock star in this gem.<br /><br />Add to that Angela Bassett, who is (to me) the best African-American female actress on the planet.  You will agree when you see her this time.<br /><br />Not to mention Tom Sizemore, who starred as the police investigator in \\"The Salton Sea\\".<br /><br />Then there's Michael Wincott, who starred in one of my all-time classic films, \\"The Doors\\".<br /><br />And how about Vincent D'Onofrio, who also starred in \\"The Salton Sea\\", \\"Men In Black\\" and \\"Full Metal Jacket\\"?<br /><br />Needless to say, the film also cast Glenn Plummer as a rock hero.  Glenn also starred in \\"The Salton Sea\\" as the dealer with the \\"crossbow\\"...remember?<br /><br />Add to that the bizarre twists and turns that culminate with a shocking ending.  This movie never ends.  It takes you down a road map filled with lefts, rights, u-turns and rollovers.<br /><br />And yes, for you guys (and gals), it is sexy.  The thread that holds the movie together is the passion of a man yearning to keep his woman...a woman wanting his man to understand \\"love\\"...an underground populace searching for fantasy and surreal \\"clips\\".<br /><br />This film will take you on a journey you've never experienced.  The cover of the DVD box reads...\\"...anything is possible.  Nothing is forbidden.\\"  Right on! If my review helps you decide, then don't try a rental.  Go buy it!  I guarantee you'll watch it more than once, twice, thrice.....<br /><br />On a scale of 1-10 in this genre', \\"Strange Days\\" gets a 10.  It was a 9 until I realized how hypnotic Juliette Lewis can be.  She has a raw talent to be rough, sexy, real, passionate and spoiled...all in one breath.  Her appeal should be a standard in Hollywood these days.  She's totally believable and uncensorable.

B00005JKPF|5.0|This movie is awesome from beginning to end with action, an excellent emotional movie near the movie's end. \\"X2\\"'s director Bryan Singer does a brilliant and better job to this sequel. The characters are intriguing and interesting because of how well received the movie has been so far critically and box-officelly. The movie has a brilliant beginning and ending with surprises to keep you afloat. Hugh Jackman is smart as Wolverine, because of how we makes his character's emotions come alive onto the screen. The emotional scene between Cyclops and Jean Grey near the end when she sacrifices her for her friends is very heartwarming and tearful. The music, production design, costume design, everything is just brilliant. The next sequel will probably be as good as this one was, maybe.
0385504209|4.0|I just finished the book.  It is definitely a page turner, kind of like John Grisham novels.  Unfortunately, it also has the same drawbacks as Grisham's novels, not mysterious enough.  The book is a tad too predictable.  I must admit, I didn't solve all of the mystery before the end, but I saw enough of it coming to make reading this book a tad annoying.  Now, did I enjoy it?  Yes, aboslutely.  I think Brown did a very good job researching the facts and the characters were mostly well developed.  I liked Sophie Neveu and Robert Langdon.  They could very well develop a la the characters from Iain Pears' art history novels.<br />I liked the puzzles, I loved the historical aspect of the story.  Yes, I started to look up the Opus Dei and Priory of Sion, as well as the Louvre and all the other sites.  BUT, I believe the history of the knights templar via a novel form was better told by Umberto Eco in Foucoult's Pendulum.  Eco didn't go into Mary Magdalene either.  The parts on the Gospel according to the Gnostics was intersting to me because I started to read the Gospel of Thomas a while ago.<br />Overall, I liked the book, but not enough to give it 5 stars.  It does, however interst me enough to read more of Dan Brown.
0679736646|4.0|Millions of humans on this planet are right now eagerly waiting for the premiere of the second installment in the Wachowsky brothers' pop stew of Hong Kong fight movies, Berkeley idealism, techno-trance music, gadgetry culture and Adams Family attire -- known as \\"The Matrix\\". Decades ago, a tormented American author was already exploring idealism through science fiction; and you know who I am talking about. It seems the central problem in PK Dick's literature is the definition of a character's identity when he discovers himself a dweller of a false (or, as we would say nowadays, \\"virtual\\") reality. \\"Ubik\\" is no exception and here you will find a very interesting blend of the Matrix and more saturnine themes, such as life after death, solitude and the ubiquity of commercial interest in modern society (my personal take at the book's title).<br />Unfortunately, Dick spends much less energy in character development than in the exploration of his main mystical insights. So don't expect Dostoievsky, but Wachowsky: entertaining pulp fiction written by a born (gnostic?) philosopher. If you liked the first Matrix movie, try PK Dick's novels for a more serious literary survey of the same themes. And when you are finally ready for the real thing, go for Bishop Berkeley and Ramana Maharshi.
B000000OAC|4.0|It is said (no doubt apocryphally) that when Queen were recording News of the World, the band in the next studio was their EMI labelmates, the Sex Pistols. One afternoon an inebriated Sid Vicious stumbled into the wrong studio, and spotted Freddie limbering up at the piano.<br />\\"Freddie Mercury!\\" he exclaimed. \\"Still bring ballet to the masses, are we?\\"<br />Freddie didn't miss a beat. \\"Oh! Mister Ferocious! Well, we are doing our best, dear\\".<br />Messrs Mercury and Ferocious. Both sadly missed, in my book.<br />Olly Buxton
0151006903|5.0|\\"Baudolino\\" by Umberto Eco is a beguiling novel full of riddles and half-truths.  What begins as a fairly standard, albeit engaging, work of historical fiction, quickly transforms into a work of almost surreal imagination.  Touching upon every imaginable mythos of the Middle Ages, from the Holy Grail to the kingdom of Prester John, to the Old Man of the Mountain and the dimensions of the Earth, Eco has created a travelogue that is completely believable, and yet must be an almost complete fabrication.    The tale is recounted by the eponymous Baudolino, adopted son of the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick, and by his own admission, something of a ne'er do well.  However, he is also a devoted son, and is determined to do his part to ensure that greater glory of his adoptive father.  After having the legend of Prester John imparted to him by one of Frederick's advisors, Baudolino is convinced of its truth, and moreover is certain that a union with this magisterial Christain kingdom is the perfect way to secure Frederick's glory.  Unfortunately, no proof of this John's kingdom exists, so Baudolino determines to fabricate a letter from Prester John that will prove his existence to Frederick, and which will convince him seek John's kingdom.  There is no shame in this act because Baudolino, being utterly convinced of the truthfulness of his sources, is certain that Frederick will find Prester John.    At this point it seems that \\"Baudolino\\" will in some way be the opposite of Eco's \\"Focault's Pendulum\\".  In this instance, instead of creating truth (or at least a perception of truth) out what were thought to be flights of fancy, Baudolino is striving to create proof of something he believes to exist through a work of pure fiction.  Thus, through the first half of the book, the reader is left with the impression that this will be another secret history.  Furthermore, this suspicion is born out by the fact that the protagonists are constantly inventing \\"holy\\" relics in order to further their respective causes.  This jives with Eco's genteel, but well know, differences with the Catholic Church; his beliefs can only be reinforced by his playful, at will creation of holy relics.    To a point, that may have been Eco's goal, and it is certainly a centerpiece of the novel, but when Baudolino actually sets out in search of Prester John, things become a bit more muddled.  He recounts creatures and places that the 21st century reader knows never existed, so the question then becomes, is Baudolino still lying, or is something deeper at work?  Before I attempt to answer that question I feel I should add that it need not even be approached by the reader.  Eco's creation, while not rooted in fact is utterly engaging and completely believable within the confines of the book.  If one approaches \\"Baudolino\\" as a twelfth century travelogue, and not as the creation of Eco, it can be approached much like the travels of Sinbad, or the tales of King Arthur.    That said, there is plenty of room for conjecture on Eco's writing.  My personal opinion is that \\"Baudolino\\" is doing one of two things, either he is 1. continuing his invention so that he might reflect some glory back on to his beloved Frederick, or 2. his own life is so wrapped up in his fabrication, he cannot separate reality from fiction and remain sane.  Or perhaps both are true and so intertwined as to be unrecognizable.  Certainly, Baudolino's fabricated letter echoes repeatedly throughout the latter half of the book, and it is entirely possible that having failed his father at the end, he feels he has no choice but to transform the fiction into reality.  Alternately, there are strong reflections of Baudolino's greatest regrets in his narrative.  In particular (and without giving anything away) I would point the reader to the similarities to a satyr Baudolino encounters and his premature child.  Whatever his ultimate intention, Baudolino's tale is undeniably imbued with his regrets.    In the end,I suspect that Baudolino has become more comfortable in his invention than he is in reality.  At the end of his life, he has become the lies by which he lived his life; the truth is uncomfortable and doesn't seem to make sense.  When one considers the backdrop of upheaval against which this novel takes place, and Baudolino's supreme love for Frederick, such a state of mind, while deluded, doesn't seem entirely unreadable.    Finally, I would like to add that while \\"Baudolino\\" is as erudite as Eco's other works with which I am familiar (\\"The Name of the Rose\\" and \\"Focault's Pendulum\\") it struck me as much more approachable.  In particular, the verbal gymnastics that made \\"Focault's Pendulum\\" such a dense minefield of puzzles has been abandoned for a much more stylish, stripped down prose.  While Eco still displays his mastery of the written word, no longer does he use three words where one will suffice.    The end result of these elements is a fascinating novel that is both approachable and filled with mystery.  Even as it entertains, \\"Baudolino\\" offers a multitude of avenues to explore between the lines.  I suspect that any ten readers will have ten completely differing interpretations of this novel, but I am equally certain that they will all agree that \\"Baudolino\\" is a wonderful work of literature that is well worth spending time with.

B000059XUO|5.0|Based on the poplaur comic book of the same name,The Crow is one of the best comic book films of all time.Eric Draven(Brandon Lee in his last role)and his fiancce Shelly Webster are brutally killed by a gang of ruthless crminals the night before their wedding.Exactly one year after their death,Eric returns from the grave and is guided by a hypnotic crow to revenge on those who killed him and Shelly.The crow leads Eric to the places he needs to be and to find the people he needs to find.I never read the comicbooks at all but I still understood the premise of this dark if sometimes depressing film,the reason why I say depressing is from the fact that Brandon Lee died during the last couple of day of shooting the film with a loaded gun.The music in the film,both the songs and the score are really wonderful and they add a perfect pitch to the film,espically the song during the end credits.While the 2nd and 3rd Crow films are just ok,this one ranks high on my list of the best comicbook films ever made,like number 2 right behind Superman.Watch and enjoy this wonderful and beautiful masterpiece.
B00008S2VH|1.0|American LIfe-by Mirwais(with words spoken through an electronic filter by madonna).  This is my suggestion as to what the name of this album should of been.  I wish Mirwais would stop wasting all of his talents w/ a woman who can't sing without the help of effects.  MIRWAIS stay solo.  Madonna do a finale tour and say good by, and while you're at it why don't you give some credit to your stylist(s), anyone who believes madonna came up w/her styles on her own is just NAIVE.
0780622553|5.0|I first watched &quot;Dark City&quot; in the theater. I was hooked at that moment. It was one of the most original films I had watched in a long time. Director Proyas does a masterful job at directing this Neo-Noir Science Fiction extravaganza. &quot;Dark City&quot; is reminiscient of &quot;Blade Runner,&quot; with its extreme set design, with obvious influences in early German expressionist films like &quot;Nosferatu&quot; and &quot;The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari.&quot; If you are a fan of &quot;Blade Runner,&quot; then &quot;Dark City&quot; is a must to watch.

B000000H48|5.0|This album is fantastic!  It's one of my 10 Desert Island albums.  I recommend this as the first King Diamond album.  <BR>It really should be called &quot;Them 2&quot; as it is a direct continuation of &quot;Them.&quot;  If you are to follow the story at all, you either need to listen to &quot;Them&quot; first, or at least read the lyrics.  It's a simple story, well told, terrifying and tragic.  My wife has banned all King Diamond albums from the family room because she said that &quot;Them&quot; gave her &quot;daymares.&quot;<BR>Every song on this excellent album stands on its own, which is not at all typical for a King album; typically there are a few songs that don't stand on their own but only advance the story and only sound good when you listen to the album top to bottom.  This album sounds even better when you listen from start to finish.  <BR>King consistently finds great guitar players (with one exception, but Herb Simonsen doesn't play on this album).  All KD albums have 2 guitar players.  Andy LaRoque has been with King from the beginning, and the second guitarist always has a different style than Andy's so the solos are identifiable and different.<BR>King's voice is always over the top, and to be honest I didn't like it at first but listened to the music because of the constantly wonderful guitar playing.  As time went by, I came to love his voice and now beleive him to be the perfect frontman to his bands (the other is Mercyful Fate, I suggest &quot;In the Shadows&quot; and &quot;Time&quot; followed by &quot;Don't Break the Oath.&quot;).<BR>I love this album.  Play it often, play it loud.
B00006LPES|5.0|It's been nearly a year since I saw 'The Piano Teacher', but I still have the images in my mind, still sharp, still intense, still somewhat disturbing. But, I like it that way. Heineke's film, is definitely one of the biggest rises in French film industry. And I agree with the other reviewers, that the film's unknownness is directly related to its unconventional tension, which literally made me scratch my seat in the theater.<br />The film focuses on Isabelle Huppert's sexual and social psychosis, and her isolation from the rest of the society. During the course of the movie, Huppert goes through a couple of sexual explosions, which are not at a pleasing nor satisfying level at all, but rather resulting in discontent and hatred among her and her partner, who is the student she gives piano lessons to. This after-scene suffices for you to feel odd. Her sexual inmaturity, gives rise to her weird behavior during daily life. Her seclusion of her own mother, that precedes her real harrassment of her, is a good example of this idea.<br />This film involves severe tension, sexual and social violence. Beware of this fact before you purchase the film. It's a brilliant film, but for some people. Some may not like the content. Great production by Heineke, great acting by Isabelle Hupport!
B00008MNYS|4.0|Robbie Williams is so huge &amp; yet most Americans have no idea who he is.  He is amazing.  He is so honest &amp; so out there &amp; so in your face.  He knows exactly who he is, exactly what his place is in this world &amp; exactly how much fun he's going to have while he's on top.  I adore him &amp; adore this CD.  It's all I've been listening to since I got it a few days ago.
B00006CXXU|5.0|In spite of her oversexy look, she's not just another untalented girl trying to gain space through the looks. She's a terrific singer, has a powerful and beautiful voice and has written almost all the songs. It certainly makes the difference. She sings from her heart because the lyrics are about her own experiences. All the songs are great. People who underrate her work only because of her appearence should liten to the cd. It's much better than her first album, which was really nice too. The best songs are Fighter (that is now a big hit and the video is also amazing), Beautiful, Make Over, Walk Away, Soar, Cruz, Get Mine Get Yours, Loving Me 4 Me, etc etc. It's certainly not another album with only one good song. The lyrics are well written and the melodies are fine, and very different one from the other, which makes the cd so not boring. It totally worth your money.
0679601686|4.0|jane austen is the most manly woman i've never met. her books are full of the kind of intricate analyses that i've only ever found in men, like myself, and have never observed in women, even women supposedly very smart, with all the benefits of formal education, indeed, even phd's from such places as harvard and berkeley. women, however smart they may be, always fall back on intuition when confronted with perplexing problems. even when their intuitions are completely impotent. i've had women tell me that they \\"thought\\" the economy was on the edge of deep recession because their \\"intuitions\\" told them so. or who said they \\"thought\\" a new business venture was destined to fail because they had an \\"intuition\\" about it. yet, when pressed for further \\"reasons\\", they were able to elaborate no further.<br />so it is against such a background that i approached ms austen. and having read p&p and mansfield park i am truly astonished that a woman wrote these books. certainly, the subject matter betrays a woman's concerns. yet, she must have been a rare woman who could patiently analyze and untangle the thoughts and actions of so many confused characters, who could resist the feminine temptation to jump to easy intuitive conclusions. i am amazed. would that there were just a few jane austens in this world. or lizzie bennetts, even. but alas, the world positively teems with lydia and kitty bennetts - and mrs bennetts! sigh.
B000066NW0|5.0|I know she's another kind of pop product that the media wanna sell to people, only in a different cover. And that her punly attitude is another weapon to sell albums to kids that are tired of Britney Spears. But her album is still very nice. Of course, only if you like pop you will enjoy it. Punks, get away from it. There are only two songs that are a little rock and roll, but not that much: Losing Grip, Sk8er Boy and Unwanted. The album is nice and the most important: she co-wrote all the songs. She has a nice voice, not amazing, but enjoyable. The best tracks are Complicated (even though I'm tired of listening to it), Mobile, Things I'll Never Say, Too Much To Ask. The new single (Losing Grip) but those songs above are better in my opinion
0671722905|3.0|i watched the bbc television production of this play and my only reaction was, huh? it seemed to be over before it began, and yet, nothing seemed to happen. there's a silly love story, with some pretty lines. and a revenge story, with some angry lines. and some fairies, and some magic. but??? oh, there's some old guy named prospero who settles some old scores and marries off his only daughter. i guess this was the point of the play: how a guy fades in to the twilight of life. i better read the play to see if i missed anything.
6305041156|1.0|Before you read further, I highly recommend the MASTERWORKS edition recently released. Also, I absolutely love this film. You can read everyone else's reviews to reinforce that opinion. But Fox Lorber? A disgrace they are. The whole movie is shifted to the top of the screen, leaving a giant black bar on the bottom of the screen. If that's not bad enough, the bright yellow subtitles are on the very bottom, making your eyes sore from moving them up and down constantly at a larger degree. The subtitles are burned in, so taking them off is not an option at all. The picture is completely not remastered, colors are way-off. It seems their only master was a worn out VHS copy that was at a Blockbuster down the street. To see what i mean by all this, get yourself the MASTERWORKS edition, and compare the restoration demonstration, the old DVD copy is just what the un-remastered material looks like. I warn you, this is better off as a very expensive drink coaster than a preservation of art. Kurosawa rolled in his grave when this was released....
B000002ADT|3.0|This review is for anyone who, like me, already owns the previous CD edition (the one that was in print as of the mid-to-late-90s) and is wondering if this remaster is worth getting. One of the features of this reissue is that the incorrect tape speed which rendered the first three tracks (side 1 of the LP) off-pitch has been corrected, and these tracks can now be heard in concert pitch. Another bonus is the extra take, previously unreleased, of &quot;Flamenco Sketches&quot;, my personal track from _Kind of Blue_. Also, the sound itself has remastered throughout. As the liner notes say, it's meant to be an improvement from &quot;tinny simulacra&quot; to more full-blown, rich instrument sounds.<br />However, be warned that while the album has been enhanced in the aforementioned ways, another thing that's been inexplicably added is quite loud tape hiss, not in the previous CD issue. For me, this is enough to cancel out the enhancements in sound and correction in pitch. Which leaves the bonus take of &quot;Flamenco Sketches&quot;, which is quite interesting. It's not nearly as cohesive and magical as the master take, so it makes for an interesting comparison. So in conclusion, I'd say to consider the only net improvement in this reissue to be the extra &quot;Flamenco&quot; take.
0684830485|3.0|I love almost all of Hemingway's novels, but this one was a daunting effort.  Line by line, or a paragraph at a time, the writing is Hemingway at his best.  Yet, inexplicably, I found that as one chapter segued interminably to the next, the story and style became muddled and could not sustain my interest.  There is much, however, that is worth the time...themes of monogamous love, war/conscience, life/death.  The heart wrenching finale illustrates the notorious he-man's mastery to convey softer, &quot;feminine&quot; sensitivity.  Definitely not the one to kick off a reader's Hemingway exposure.

B00008OSD4|5.0|This film is very well composed; the story is at times somewhat subtle and is well worth multiple viewings.  At the same time, there's a good amount of humor and suspense.  The music is fantastic, the camera work, lighting, costuming, and casting are all excellent.  Enjoy!

B00000G3AZ|3.0|this picture has little arc in its story. it's not clear where the story's heading, there's little dramatic tension, as a result it's rather dull. thankfully, the people and places are pretty to look at, and there is some humor here, but huh???  it's no pride and prejudice, or even persuasion. it certainly doesn't make me want to read the book.

B0000039LE|4.0|The film genre I call 'scare me flicks' actually began with director George Romero's 1968 film \\"Night Of The Living Dead\\", but director John Carpenter's 1978 film \\"Halloween\\" popularized the genre.  \\"Halloween\\" also marks the starring debut of Jamie Lee Curtis.  Jamie Lee plays the innocent victim Laurie, a role she plays well.<br />By current standards \\"Halloween\\" is a tame film, but \\"Halloween\\" contains all the 'scare me flick' elements: attractive young women victims; arrogant young men victims; a nebulous threatening presence; and unstoppable terror.  'Scare me flicks' have entertained us while redefining societal relationships -- people might laugh at Mom's threats, but nobody laughs at the unstoppable bully Michael Myers.
B00007G1ZC|5.0|Clearly his most personal film, this is a film that will be name checked, discussed, studied, and ultimatley be copied in the future. The dream sequence is pretty much in every single film made at this point, but no one dared to make an entire movie out of a dream sequence, or sequences as Kurosawa did. Cinema has always had its boundaries pushed forward, but more people need to think outside the box. If there are no rules of reality in making a film, then make the film acording to a reality that doesn't exist. That is what Kurosawa finally was able to do at 80 years of age, and more people will start using this movie as a reference tool to further go into their souls. As for the DVD itself, it is pretty bare-boned, but the low list-price makes it a very clear decision on what will become a classic masterpiece.<br />Best shot/sequence:<BR>This was a tough one to pick out from the entire movie,<BR>but the very last shot in the movie, the entire credit sequence where all you see is the stream flowing with the Moscow Symphony playing the music in the background is astonishing. Stay for the credits.
B00005JLZ9|2.0|this movie had a good cast but not a pretty name (Basic) plus the plot was simple as if it was already done or something not the very best but the reason i gave it 2 stars was because of aaceptional acting from john and samuel <br />p.s. you guys could do better than this....another p.s. dont see basic save your money for another movie <br />from, ben n.
B00005JKPF|5.0|I was absolutely blown away by this movie. And that's an understatement.<br />If you've read many of my reviews, you'd know how rare it is for me to give any movie five stars. I save them for films that really do something to me, and that usually means heavy dramas like \\"The Pianist\\" or revolutionary films like \\"Requiem for a Dream\\" or \\"Moulin Rouge.\\" No way did I expect \\"X2\\" to wear the same crown.<br />Sure I had seen the first film, and been moderately happy with it flaws and all. When I heard a big positive buzz on this one though, I became excited. Much better then the first? Cool. And that's the frame of mind I went in to see it with, thinking it would be a significantly better film then the one I gave three stars to; say maybe a four star movie.<br />This, my friends, is now my favorite comic book movie. Sorry original Batman and Superman films, sorry Spiderman. You used to be my top picks, but \\"X2\\" came along. Go figure it'd be a sequel.<br />\\"X2\\" does everything right the first one did wrong. Many amazing action scenes, each one better then the best moments in the original. Stronger characterizations and relationship building. A much stronger plot that is more involving, urgent and dire. And an ending that impacts you with a crater-sized hole. It's true that it borrows a lot from other great sci-fi films. The ending is, in fact, a quite obvious lift from another well known franchise. But I found I didn't care. That's because director Bryan Singer and his crew did the job right and created equally strong versions of prior-used themes and scenes...<br />But my favorite moments all stem from the characterization incorporated into the film (such as a scene with Wolverine and various students at the school on what seems to be a normal night), and the flushing out of its theme of prejudice. \\"X2\\" takes the first film's analogy comparing humans afraid of X-men to real world homophobia to a new level. Military renegade Will Striker (Brian Cox) has been determined to\\"heal\\" mutants to make them regular human, similar to real groups that try to convert homosexuals to be straight. The ability comic books and their films have (along with other sci-fi tales) to deal with current issues in an analogy is a fantastic way to deal with subjects, and \\"X2\\" doesn't come close to dropping the ball. Oh, and there are just so many memorable moments in \\"X2.\\" Every few minutes in the film, I saw something I tried to remember, only to forget it shortly after by another great scene. Look for them, but you'll probably have to see it again just to remember them all.<br />This movie does have some minor flaws, but really they're just nit-picks. \\"X2\\" doesn't really allow you to dwell on them though, because the next genius scene will wipe any memory of them away. Check this one out. Definitely my favorite superhero film of all time!
B00005JLXE|4.0|This movie wasnt the best but it wasnt bad either it had its ups and downs Ben Affleck had a great performance why does everyone bash on him hes a good actor....daredevil mainly came out in febuary because it wasnt really convinceing to be a summer movie since daredevil never really one of marvel's most popular characters all in all it was good i will se the sequel if it comes out for sure
B00005JKPF|1.0|First of all, before I even start to write one word about this movie I need to explain a little something about myself. I USED to collect comic books and the trading cards, like most teenage guys. I have long past that interest in comic. Infact, I remember practically nothing. Which I suppose is sad considering all the money I put into it. IF YOU LIKE X-MEN 2 PLEASE DO NOT READ THIS REVIEW. THIS REVIEW IS FOR PEOPLE LIKE MYSELF WHO KNOW VERY LITTLE ABOUT THE COMIC BOOK CHARACTERS. But of course that won't stop people from giving me unhelpful votes. So to be fair I will try to be as unbaise as possible and review the movie from both sides.<br /> FOR PEOPLE WHO KNOW NOTHING ABOUT X-MEN: One of the many reason I didn't like the first movie was because the movie didn't really explain any of the characters. In all fairness it did go into depth with the Rogue character (Anna Paquin) and the Wolverine character (Hugh Jackman). But, the movie forgot that there were other characters in the movie that needed to be explained. There are characters we never come to know anything about, except for what they're special powers are. But, for those who know nothing about X-Men we are left in the dark. The movie doesn't try to pander to unfamiliar audiences. This movie is strickly for those who already know everything about X-Men. As I said, the first X-Men offered little to no explaination about it's characters, well, \\"X2\\" just picks up where the first one left off. The movie assumes we know everything and absolutely no explanation is given about anything. I mean, I'm not asking for much here, all I'm really asking for is a story that can capture my interest as well. As someone who doesn't know anything about X-Men I wanted the movie to be able to reach it's entire audience. Then again, of course, why would someone go see this movie if they don't know anything about these characters. Which is exactly why I didn't want to see this movie, but, I went with two younger cousins who naturally just HAD to see this movie. I didn't know what I was watching. The movie story-line is so weak that if you asked my what's is about, I wouldn't be able to answer you. It's not that I wouldn't want to give away the story, it's just that I honestly don't really know myself. The movie's story takes shape near the end of the movie. I guess this was done so that they would have more to work with in the third one. But all \\"X2\\" really is, is payoff and no set-up. Is there action in this movie? Yes. But that's mostly all there is. It's just payoff after payoff after payoff and no build up. There was one scene where all the mutants are under attack and they start to run away from the humans. My cousin and me started asking each other why are they running away. Why don't they use their powers? They clearly outnumbered the humans. And could have probably caused more harm to them then the humans could have with they're guns. For people who know nothing about \\"X2\\" save your money and stay away. A real piece of junk that so far is the worst movie I've seen this year.  * 1\2 out of [5 *'s]<br /> FOR PEOPLE WHO LIKE X-MEN: If you enjoyed the first movie \\"X2\\" is going to be twice as entertaining to you. Most people will enjoy the fact that they are more characters in this one. But, we don't get to see them all perform they're special powers. Some new characters are barely used. I thought the character \\"Beast\\" was suppose to be in this one, but, I didn't see him. And they're were other characters, who's names I don't know, have very small parts. But, over-all, if you really enjoyed the first one and are a comic book fan, this will probably be the best movie you'll see all year. And to some, it will become they're new favorite movie of all time. Others will say it's the greatest movie they have ever seen before in their life. Trust me. You will be in for a real treat. If you have friends that aren't interested in \\"X-Men\\" don't bring them with you. They won't like the movie. This is really just for the fans.<br />[5 *'s]out of [5 *'s]<br /> FOR EVERYONE: There are two things fans and nonfans will enjoy. The two most interesting characters in this movie are \\"Nightcrawler\\" (Alan Cummings) and \\"Mystique\\" (Rebecca Romijn Stamos). They provide some laughs in the movie and are really the two characters you be exciting about seeing. They are the most interesting characters in the movie.<br /> Bottom-line: FOR FANS ONLY! If anyone thought the first one had no depth to it as far as character devolpment go, wait to you see this one. The movie is basically a big action sequence. It's all payoff and no set-up. Fans of the comic book will love the movie, no doubt! It will turn out to be the greatest movie they have ever seen.s really just for the fans.<BR>[5 *'s]out of [5 *'s]<br /> FOR EVERYONE: There are two things fans and nonfans will enjoy.

B000088E6D|1.0|The problem with this CD is that it wreaks of ego, and yet no substance. <br />The voice is the same as any other I've ever heard, but has been produced by a fellow Canadian, and a label that needs to make it's money back by placing it on soundtracks, desperate to get their investment back.<br />The songs of boring, boring, boring.
B000001EPB|5.0|THIS IS A VERY GOOD CD.  THE MUSIC IS WONDERFUL AND IT IS ESPECIALLY NICE WITH THE DANCE TRACKS.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS CD....
B000068QY7|1.0|i absolutely love definitely maybe and morning glory.  be here now and standing on the shoulders of giants were ok.  but this album doesn't do it for me at all.  force of nature and hindu times are decent tracks, but even the best tracks on the album are only good to me because they are vestiges of what i love about listening to older oasis albums....maybe noel should start doing [something different] if it will help him and his band regarner some respect and most importantly, musical inspiration.
1568497369|5.0|&quot;And Then There Were None&quot; is an oustanding mystery story---perhaps the greatest mystery novel ever written. My biggest regret is that when I first encountered this book I could not resist temptation and I peeked at the last chapter before reading the book all the way through. Nevertheless, it is still one of my favorite books of all time.<br />If you are most familiar with this book via the many movies that have been made from this novel, the original book will be a surprise. Most of the film versions have ruined the ending by trying to impose a &quot;happy ending.&quot; As a result, most of the power of the novel is severely dilluted. (A notable exception is the recent movie &quot;Identity&quot;, about which I will say nothing except that while it may stray from the letter of Christie's novel, it stays closest to its spirit.) Don't go to Blockbuster----read the book first!
B00008J2DQ|5.0|This album is the best yet from Godsmack. They have grown tremendously since their first album, which was still a very good album. Faceless is a masterpiece. With the combination of Sully's beautiful voice in Serenity, and the drums in such songs as I ...Hate You and Make Me Believe, you can't get any better of an album. If someone tells you this album [stinks],,, you should go buy it yourself and try it out, because there is no way this album could [stink].
B00008WG3U|5.0|All I can say, is wow. This CD is awesome. Definatley one of NOFX's best.
B000075BFK|5.0|On track 4, &quot;Changed man&quot; they mention an &quot;Escalade.&quot;  If this is a track he made before he died in 1996, how can he rap about a car that wasnt even manufactured until 1999?  Tupac lives on...
B00000JLWW|5.0|I personally think that this movie is truly a classic. I loved it and have watched it millions of times (each timed I've both loved it and cried). People sometimes forget that this is only a movie and that everything is not based on the true life event. The movie was very realistic. Leonardo Dicaprio and Kate Winslet have amazing performaces. This movie is definatly worth seeing and if you having you should see it as soon as you can!
B00005JKPF|5.0|I really enjoyed X-2.  If you are into special effect and good action, this is your movie.
B000089RVX|5.0|The first time you listen to it, her voice is a litte grating, but that quickly passes.  Haunted is the best song.  Even Hello, the slow piano song, is very well done.  Bring me to life is ok, but I'm already getting tired of it.  I like 12 Stones, but this is clearly aimed for radio play.  Overall, it rocks.  You can listen to every song on the cd.  And best of all, they mix it up so that every song doesn't sound alike.  Definitely buy it, if you like rock.
B00005JKNF|4.0|The first half of this movie is magnificent.  Altman effortlessly handles the complexity of both the &quot;masters&quot; and the servants, as they settle in for the weekend.  The performances are spot on (even Ryan Phillipe is actually more than adequate given that his inadequacies are properly used), and the script and direction are perfect.  I don't think that I've ever seen a movie that explored these dynamics so successfully.  (Aside:  anybody who sees this and wishes that they were a member of the English aristocracy has problems best dealt with outside of such a hierarchical situation.)<BR>So, what's wrong with it?  Previous reviewers were right in saying that it isn't really a good whodunnit.  That's fine.  Uniquely, though, it becomes almost tedious once something starts happening.  This isn't a fault, really, especially as the the end result adds poignancy to the whole.  It's just that the third act is a little boring, even with the wonderful build up and thought-provoking denouement.<BR>I recommend this movie without reservation, except to say that I wish that Altman et al. had carried through a little better.  Still, an almost perfect movie about a happily lost time of manners uber alles.<BR>PS: How many people when seeing such films always see themselves as part of the aristocracy?  The odds are against you, you know.  Sorry, couldn't resist.
B00005YW4H|1.0|When I first heard this CD, I knew nothing of Norah Jones. My first impression was that she sounded like a teeny-bopper country music [hopeful]. I still don't understand why the word \\"jazz\\" is  so frequently mentioned when referring to her style/voice. I personally did not like her voice or this CD AT ALL. I'm glad I didn't buy it, but I still feel sorry for my friend who wasted her money on it.
B000089A06|2.0|Oh, where to start?<br />First off, I really like actor Edward Norton.  I think he is a brilliant actor.  With that out of the way, he is miscast in this movie.  There, I said it.  So is Harvey Keitel.  And Ralph Fiennes.  And even the superb Phillip Seymour Hoffman.<br />The book Red Dragon has already been made into a movie, and definitively so.  It was called \\"Manhunter\\", and it was even made by the SAME PRODUCER who made this one.<br />Ted Tally, screenwriter of \\"The Silence of the Lambs\\", is credited with the screenplay on \\"Red Dragon\\".  However, there are SO MANY lines in this film that are word-for-word reproductions of dialogue in \\"Manhunter\\".  Either he copied them word for word from that film, or the lines were directly from the book and they were used in \\"Manhunter\\" too.  Either way, Tally is taking sole credit for someone else's work.<br />Yes, I am a big fan of \\"Manhunter\\", and I've seen it many, many times.  And I bet \\"Red Dragon\\" director Brett Ratner has too.  Ratner is a self-described movie nut, too, as well as director.  I would find it VERY difficult to believe that he hasn't seen \\"Manhunter\\" at least a few times in the past.  And so much of \\"Red Dragon\\" seems lifted directly from \\"Manhunter\\" that it goes beyond coincidence.<br />Well, he lifted a lot of stuff but not its style.  \\"Red Dragon\\" is to \\"Manhunter\\" what paint-by-numbers is to a Van Gogh.<br />So many things in \\"Red Dragon\\" seem like blatant copies of things from \\"Manhunter\\", down to shot selection, scene structure, editing choices, etc.<br />Unfortunately, those of you who have seen \\"Red Dragon\\" but have never seen \\"Manhunter\\" can never see \\"Manhunter\\" with the same set of eyes that we \\"Manhunter\\" fans have.  So you may never know the excitement and thrills of that movie quite the same way.<br />But believe me when I say that \\"Red Dragon\\" copies so many elements of it but never reaches the level that \\"Manhunter\\" does.<br />Brian Cox played Dr. Lektor in \\"Manhunter\\" (don't worry about the spelling), and he was spot-on perfect.  It made Hopkins' subsequent version seem over-the-top and too theatrical.  William Petersen played former FBI agent Will Graham, and he was old enough and battle-scarred enough to play it perfectly.  Norton just can't pull it off with the same intensity or believability.<br />Sadly, in \\"Red Dragon\\", even Hopkins seems to be phoning it in.<br />For \\"Manhunter\\", director Michael Mann had a cast of largely unknown actors (at the time).  Casting higher-profile actors for \\"Red Dragon\\", while a smart business decision, was a poor artistic one.<br />And in \\"Manhunter\\", we didn't need spooky atmospherics to set a mood.  Hopkins' Dr. Lecter in this movie and in \\"Lambs\\" is imprisoned in a dank, creepy basement.  But in \\"Manhunter\\", Cox's Lecter was in a pristine, all-white, sterile environment, and he STILL was creepier than Hopkins.  In \\"Red Dragon\\" we are shown Lecter's attack on Graham, and we are shown The Tooth Fairy's Dickens-ian childhood traumas.  It is all spelled out for us.  In \\"Manhunter\\", those elements are merely referred to fleetingly, but you can read the rest from the actors' eyes and performances.<br />\\"Red Dragon\\" is a FAR INFERIOR version of the novel by Thomas Harris than Michael Mann's brilliant \\"Manhunter\\".  And it even borders on plagiarism in spots, IMHO.

B00005JLRT|3.0|The dark subject matter in Nemesis is interesting but the storyline is not as developed as I would have hoped &, come on: Romulus & Remus? I would contend that in most cases Gene Roddenberry's naming of worlds & species has been a little too Earth-centric. I realize part of his vision was to get us to be more united & making things familiar is a good way to facilitate that, but I suspect the Romulans would maybe have picked a different name for themselves which would have led to a whole new history for it's \\"sister planet\\", Remus. Don't get me started on Vulcans.<br />I would recommend this film for fans to own, but would say to the rest of the world just rent.
B00005JKPF|3.0|First off, it is nice to see the introduction of several new mutant characters in this film.  But motion pictures can never match comic books in scale, imagination, and narrative tightness and efficiency.  Thus is the underlying problem with the \\"X-Men\\" movies.<br />In \\"X2\\", we find our reluctant heroes under attack by a rogue General Stryker (Brian Cox, the ORIGINAL Dr. Hannibal Lecter on film) and the Xavier School/Institute/whatever forcibly attacked.  The Xavier school, if you remember from the first movie, is a prep school-cum-mutant training academy for good-looking, upper-middle-class mutant kids.<br />On the run, the X-men must keep themselves and the students safe yet find who is behind the attack and why.  Magneto and Mystique join forces with our heroes for a while, and that stretches credibility just a bit.  Did I just use the word \\"credibility\\" in a review of a movie about mutant superheroes?<br />The movie is mostly a series of action setpieces, some Wolverine history uncovered, and spiffy effects.  But the story never really gets you too involved or interested.<br />I'm not saying you should NOT see it, but be aware that any movie franchise that wants to be all things to all people is bound to disappoint on multiple levels.<br />On the positive side, Mystique is given much more to do (and the sequence where she plants the seeds for Magneto's eventual escape from his plastic prison is pleasingly clever), new movie character The Nightcrawler as played by Alan Cumming is a fun visual treat, and you get plenty of bang for your buck with the movie's 133 minute running time.<br />Oh, yeah.  One of the X-Men from the first movie dies.  You'll have to see it to see which one.  But that part of the film was also the weakest.  With all of these incredible superpowers these mutants have, and their proven ability to emerge unscathed from just about any situation, logic dictates that it would take quite an incredible life-or-death situation to kill one of them.  And the one in the movie that results in so-and-so's death doesn't quite live up to that.nd the one in the movie that results in so-and-so's death doesn't quite live up to that.
B0000931OG|3.0|I've always appreciated how Blur transforms their identity with each new record and I have no qualms claiming them to be one of my favorite bands of all time. Having listened to Gorillaz and Damon Albarn's awesome Mali Music, I can see where much of the influence of Think Tank comes from.  However, Graham Coxon's contributions are a huge part of what defined the sound and allowed for differentiation among the various projects Damon is a part of. Think Tank falls short of being great on first listen and sounds more like a less inspired Gorillaz album.  Too many songs plod along with what sounds like a synthetic drum beat - an odd effect given that Blur has a drummer and a very capable one at that.<br />The album isn't bad.  Songs like &quot;Crazy Beat&quot;, &quot;We've Got A File on You&quot; evoke the more familiar Blur sound while &quot;Morroccan Peoples Revolutionary Bowls Club&quot; is a nice new direction.  But overall Think Tank sounds lazy.  Too lazy.  <br />I liked the sonice experimentation of 13.  What makes that album worthwhile is how with all the synthesized effect, the true live band nature of Blur shown through and the ablum operates on a gut instinct level.  In contrast, this latest effort too often, WAY too often, sounds more like a solo project of musical machinery than a live band.<br />Still worth a listen though, especially if you like the laid back trippy groove sounds that Gorillaz would sometimes find.<br />Still, at three years between albums there is almost too much thought in this tank and not enough action.
B000066F6H|3.0|The Hives are a welcome guest in the hot white, shortlived, spotlight.  Their hooks are catchy and their stage swagger is  fun.  Their hammy tunes come off rather MC5-ish and at times Turbonegro - or better yet, Hollywood Superstars (an underground smack-swagger band who boast cult status overseas).  I get a kick out of foreigners who come to America and out-America us.  Good stuff for the kids, but I prefer the real thing.

B0000931OG|5.0|With this album Blur continues to evolve into a shadow of its former self.  The loss of Coxon (lead guitar) has caused this album to be less guitar orientated but that is to be expected.  Self titled and especially 13 showed the direction that Blur was headed in prior to the loss of Coxon.  This album flows better than 13 did, although they do throw in a few songs that are purely sound straight off of an earlier work.  I am just happy to see a band that is unafraid of change and is clearly very talented.  Those who don't like all the Blur albums (especially the newer ones) may be disappointed with this evolution towards a less &quot;rock&quot; sound.  But Blur will always be the quintessential brit-pop band, too bad they never took off in the states.
B00004Y6Q5|4.0|Musically, the C.D. is an artistic and poignant merging of quality classical and electronica music.  The Kronos String Quartet is known for both its fecundity and contemporary experimental style(s).  Their dedication to experimentation is a excellent match for D.J., Clint Mansell's cerebral approach to electronica.  <br />The chaotic and twitchy moodiness of the score works best while viewing the film and does lack something when taken independently.  The music follows with erratic immediacy the highs and lows involved in the drug addictions of the film's characters.  I remember my first viewing of the film at the theater as completely absorbing.  I emerged from the theater in a post-Dionysian stupor.  After watching the film later on DVD, I realized that the narrative intensity of the actual story was often carried by the emotive strength of the soundtrack.  Without any reference to the narrative of the film, the frequent swapping of blissful interludes (which decrease in occurrence as the soundtrack progresses) with the prevailing disturbing musical theme would seem a little arbitrary as well as too stark for passive listening.  It is this minor flaw that cost my rating the fifth star.  However, the sheer power of the pathos conveyed by the music warrant its purchase.
B00008AY3L|5.0|Ben Harper has done it again. He has blown the mind of all listeners and leaves everyone in shock with his new CD. The CD is off the hook. Each songs sounds different and has a little different style. If you dont have a copy you for sure need to get one.
B000063DHL|5.0|It always bothers me when people put this album down just because the band decided to use guitar synthesizers. That dosen't mean they sold out or weren't \\"metal\\" anymore. In fact, other than Piece Of Mind this album and Seventh Son, which both feature guitar synthesizers, are my two favorites and were the bands most popular albums. It goes to show you that change isn't always a bad thing. Anyways, this is really the album where the guitar playing shines throughout. Seventh Son had its many moments, but this album has SUPERB playing throughout. Lyrically it is also very introspective, with great lyrics in songs like Sea Of Madness and The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner.On the latter song Bruce vividly describes what an athlete, like myslef, goes through when running a race. It is truly brilliant. Now, a song by song review.<br /> Caught Somewhere In Time- Great way to start the album with that memorable opening riff. The chorus will be caught in your mind for a long, long time. Great synth work especially. 5/5<br /> Wasted Years- Maybe their biggest hit besides Run To The Hills. Fun chorus, good light tempo song sandwich's between two darker ones. 5/5<br /> Sea Of Madness- Lyrically beautiful, great chorus and a very dark atmosphere. Hardest one here uses least synth. 4.5/5<br /> Heaven Can Wait- Very similar to Wasted Years in that its a more up-beat song. Catchy guitar solo with fun sing-a-long chorus. Good, long instrumental section as well. Lyrics have a  very feel-good tone. 4.5/5<br /> The Loneliness Of The Long Distance Runner- The most moving song here, really takes into what its like to run a race if you never have before, or even just competing against someone for something. Another cathcy guitar riff in the beginning, then it explodes into a fast, hard song until the chorus which is sung beautifully. 5/5<br /> Stranger In A Strange Land- Slow and very melodic with a great opening riff. The problem is that it gets kind of repetitive and overkills the chorus. Nice solos too.4.5/5<br /> De Ja Vu- Good lyrics, even better use of synth here really enhances the song. On BNW, Dream of Mirrors also has to do with the de ja vu thing, but this song is better, albeit less complex. 4/5<br /> Alexander The Great- You've probably heard stuff about how this is Maiden's best song or whatever, but let me be the first to tell you that it isn't THAT great. It is very good, but I think that Bruce sings too fast and you don't always pick up on what he's saying, which is a shame because the lyrics really cool and tell about the amazing life of Alexander The Great. The music is played very tight here, making it almost sound like one instrument that's playing. Great musicianship. 4.5/5<br /> Somewhere In Time is definetly synth-metal at its best. Pick this and Seventh Son up as soon as you can.
B00008972S|5.0|The movie: Without a doubt one of America's treasures.<br />The packaging: First rate with one exception.

B00003CXTG|1.0|I saw this lame movie last night and was blown away by how weak it was. The lines were so trite that I actually felt embarrassed for everyone who was involved in this film. It was so \\"Hollywood\\". There was never a moment in the movie when I was not acutely aware of the fact that it was an over-inflated production. In other words, I never lost myself in the story. Also, I thought the attack scenes were awful. I mean, jeeze, whenever a plane was fired upon, the cockpit always exploded. The cockpit!? That would not happen. The fuel tanks are in the wings, not the cockpit. How stupid!!!

However, there are significant differences between the two and the main differences are reflected in the titles. As the titles suggest, &quot;Jack&quot; is more of an autobiography told in a very opinionated manner whereas Gerstner's book is more about the company during Gerstner's years and how (in broad terms) the company transitioned to a more flexible, entrepreneurial organization.<br />The book is organized into five parts: (1) Gerstner's beginnings at IBM, (2) Strategy, (3) Culture, (4) Lessons Learned, and (5) Observations. The first four parts are mostly about IBM and the transformation whereas the last section is mostly about Gerstner's views on industry, society, journalists, etc. I highly enjoyed sections 1-4 but felt section 5 didn't really fit the book purpose and it seemed almost as though the editor/publisher convinced him to add the section in order to make the book the standard size. The problem with section 5 is that Gerstner's states clearly that he believes the book should be about IBM and the turnaround, but section 5 is a half hearted attempt to give some personal musings about miscellanious things that at best seem like good political opinions and at worst sound like whinings.<br />However, excepting section 5, I got more out of this book more than Welch's. Gerstner clearly tries to lead the reader to greater understanding of the IBM situation, the thinking behind the decisions that were made, and the resulting turnaround. He does this in a style that doesn't suggest his answers are universal ones. He recognizes that imparting better understanding rather than the right answers is the appropriate goal for helping others to achieve better results in complex environments. This book probably doesn't deserve a permanant place on your bookshelf (i.e. it is unlikely to be a classic), but if your looking for better understanding of the IBM turnaround or of large business in general, this is a good book to read. If your looking for a better understanding of an individual CEO read Welch's book.<br />STRENGTHS: Written in the standard style of popular business books so it has fairly short chapters and is easy to read. Doesn't try to espouse too much theory or universal answers. Does a good job at explaining why certain decisions were made and certain strategies selected. Doesn't get bogged down in stock prices and financial data.<br />WEAKNESSES: Section 5, Gerstner's observations I thought was off target and weaker than the remainder of the book. Little insight into Gerstner himself (but that wasn't the book's intention). Some sections were a bit too brief and could've used additional detail.
014028009X|5.0|I read this novel and its sequel last year and laughed out loud at the many hilarities that Bridjet does in the course of one year. The word &quot;singleton&quot; has replaced &quot;spinster&quot; and many of the book's readers, especially women, are left feeling elation because of the plight of modern woman is no longer frowned upon but celebrated. Bridjet Jones is a semi-miserable, overweight, alcoholic, nicotine addict whose only crime is being unmarried, as deemed by her mother. Daniel Cleaver and Mark Dacry spice up the novel as the men Bridjet must choose between January and December. But, not all is concentrated on the idea of the newly contemporary romantic comedic fiction genre because the story's also about perfection. All of Bridjet's addictions are what most people today have but because Helen Fielding realized that a character with flaws makes a beautiful person, as is the ancient Japanese adage, Bridjet Jones makes herself a symbolism of the best that is yet to come with a little help from her &quot;urban family&quot; and a new and improved attitude. It's amazing how Bridjet pines for the one who doesn't really want her (Daniel Cleaver) while the one she should be with (Mark Darcy) is pursuing her, which represents the basic human desire to want what's unavailable to us. &quot;Bridjet Jones's Diary&quot; is the first and most original book in women's fiction that presents a new genre in which all people, &quot;singletons&quot; and &quot;smug marrieds&quot;, can enjoy. Readers would also love its sequel, &quot;Bridjet Jones: The Edge of Reason&quot;, and the &quot;Shopaholic&quot; trilogy by Sohpie Kinsella: &quot;Confessions of a Shopaholic&quot;, &quot;Shopaholic Takes Manhattan&quot;, and &quot;Shopaholic Ties the Knot&quot;. Other novels to enjoy are &quot;Simply Divine&quot;, &quot;Bad Heir Day&quot;, &quot;Farm Fatale&quot;, and &quot;Gossip Hound&quot; by Wendy Holden. Happy reading!
B00008VGL6|4.0|I'm enjoying this album.  Unlike his prior cover EP which was brilliantly offbeat and headed off in its own direction, this collection of songs hearkens back in many ways to the mid-80's Mode heyday sound of SGR, Black Celebration, and Music for the Masses.  I was pleasantly surprised on the first listening as those are my favorites in the Depeche catalogue.  All the songs seem to blur together in a dark grey wash.  It's quite a sinister combination, almost as if Alan were back arranging.  There are interesting aural similarities between the songs here and many of that prior era's instrumentals and B-Sides.  Gore's voice sounds beautiful and haunting, wafting in and out w/ the pulsing strains of the low key instrumentation.  It really brought me back in a wave of nostalgia, and will garner many more listens.  Recommended.
B00006BTCA|1.0|Did you ever see the movie Sid and Nancy? Sid and Johnny eating beans and hating the tedious monotony of their lives. Yelling out BORING BORING BORING and then the classic Daleks inpersonation EXTERMINATE EXTERMINATE. That's how I feel every time I hear this band.<br />No imagination whatsoever. <br />If you're older than 25 you've already heard much better variations of this type of music so please don't bother with Interpol. They offer nothing original. If you're under 25 then this sound is probably new to you so you'll probably think it's cool to like this band. <br />Life is wasted on youth.
B00008H2LE|5.0|This cd kix [rear-end] the whole cd goes really smooth too the end of one song leads on to the begging of the next song... even the intro.  its really good if u liked hybrid theory ull also like this cuz it kix [rear-end] well worth the money and if u have a little extra get the enhanced one with the bonus dvd cuz its really cool
B000002JPA|5.0|Dream Theater are one of those bands that get you hooked immediately, but the sheer brilliance doesn't shine through for some time. Or at least, that's what happened with me. This was in fact my first Dream Theater album. I remember I bought it on holiday and played the majestic opening riff of Pull Me Under on the beach (really a perfect setting).<br />The music here is nothing short of staggering. Its not simply that its incredibly technical, or even just that these musicians have incredible technical skill (though both those things are true). Its that everything is played with so much passion and energy. Shredding lacks emotion? Listen to Petrucci's soul-filled solo on Another Day alone and you'll be proved wrong. The best song here (if I had to choose one) would have to be the classic Metropolis Part 1: The Miracle And The Sleeper. This opens up with a thunderous riff, has about 3 minutes of superb vocals and then the most incredible instumental section. How did they write that? How did they piece it together? Its not just that its so long, its that it feels much shorter as not a second was wasted.<br />The variety is also noteworthy. Another Day and Surrounded have an uplifting, almost poppy sound, while Pull Me Under and Under A Glass Moon have a thrashy metal feel to them. Take The Time is a mixture of funk, rock and classic prog while Metropolis and Learning To Live are full on prog metal tracks with huge, incredible instrumental sections. And Wait For Sleep is one of the most beautiful songs I've ever heard. Period.<br />As for the musicians, well what can be said that hasn't already been said? John Petrucci is not just as guitarist of high technical skill - he writes fantastic guitar riffs, breaks, licks and solos. As I said before, he does play with passion and a strong passion at that. Kevin Moore (who left the band after their 1994 album Awake) is not the most technical keyboard player the band has seen (that would be current member Jordan Rudess), but he is still a great musician as he proves here, and also a great composer as he shows on Wait For Sleep. Bassist John Myung is a little lost in the mix here, but he still proves himself with his solo on Metropolis. Mike Portnoy is a great drummer (I can't pick a particular moment, he's just fantastic all round!) and James LaBrie is one of the greatest vocalists I've ever heard (just listen to Wait For Sleep and Another Day! Though he is fantastic through out).<br />In conclusion, this is Dream Theater's best and one of the greatest albums of all time.he is still a great musician as he proves here, and also a great composer as he shows on Wait For Sleep.

0316921173|3.0|I wanted to respond to &quot;a reader from San Diego.&quot;  Yes, there is much to recommend in David Foster Wallace's work.  On the other hand, there are many reasons not to love it as well.  I admire the chances Mr. Wallace takes with literature and his willingness to experiment and create a work that all rules of commercial publishing should say is completely unmarketable.  However, my personal feeling is that his writing draws attention to itself more than is necessary.  I prefer to be less aware of the author when I am reading.  When reading Dostoyevski, for example, I do not get the sense that the author is showing off like Mariah Carey hitting a squeaky high note that is nearly at a level only dogs can hear.  It is misguided to dismiss everyone who does not fall in love with this book as unintelligent or lazy.
B00005JKPF|5.0|I liked it a lot. It was better than the first one (which I loved) and it fulfilled all my comic book fanboy desires and dreams. When I saw the first X-Men movie, I told Shell that \\"I've been waiting my whole life for this movie\\" and that was true. I read my first X-Men comic in 1972. I bought the first \\"New X-Men\\" comic (#94) the day it came out... who knew someday the X-Men would be on the big screen. I don't really read funny books much anymore, but there is a place in my heart for these characters.<br />Cameos, cameos, cameos<BR>1) Collosus. I was happy to see the big russian make an appearance (short as it was) and hope this means that we'll see more of him in the next flick. My only complaint with the entire movie is that we didn't see more of Peter and the refugees that escaped the raid on the school.<BR>2) Siryn. She was a blip on the radar (though a memorable one), but I was happy to see her... seeing Banshee would have been better, bet you take what you can get and what we got was great.<BR>3) Shadowcat/Kitty Pride. Nice to see her back, if only to dash through a few walls. <BR>4) Beast. Missed him? He was the guy on TV while the security guard was in the bar. I hope this means we'll see him in the next flick (even sans the blue fur).<BR>5) Gambit. I hate gambit... LOATHE him... But it was a nice nod. For those who missed it, Remy LeBeau's name appeared in the database that Mystique was going through in Stryker's base.<br />Mixed and Matched to good effect<BR>1) William Stryker. I've always loved Brian Cox... he's good in everything. But who is Stryker? Stryker (to me) seemed to be the combination of a few characters. (a) Stryker, leader of the Marauders (which his group emulated in the film), (b)Dr. Bolivar Trask. Trask was a mutant hunter that created the sentinels (and had a mutant son) and (c)The head of the Weapon X project (name escapes me) that created Wolverine.<BR>2) Jason Stryker/The Illusionist. This was a nice twist and sort of a nod to two ofmy favorite old school characters. (a)Larry Trask (son of Bolivar Trask) and (b)Jason Wyngarde/Mastermind. Mastermind was one of Magneto's original brotherhood and was an AMAZING Illusionist... and was ugly as a stump.... <br />Performances<BR>1) The original cast was great... no exceptions. The movie felt less like \\"Wolverine and his Amazing Friends\\" and more like the X-men. Everyone was perfect.<BR>2) Storm. Halle Berry seems to have finally warmed to the role and seemed a great deal more natural... I really enjoyed her performance.<BR>3) Mystique. Rebecca Romjin Stamos wasn't given much to work with in the first movie (probably because she is not first and foremost an actress), but this time out she was great. She is a very visual storyteller and her face and body convied a lot more this time around and her lines were delivered well.<BR>4) Nightcrawler. Wow... I love Alan Cumming. I hoped... but ... Wow... he stole the film.<BR>5) Wolverine. Hugh Jackman rules... he was funny, tough and very beliveable as the berserker.<BR>6) Magneto. Is it just me or is Ian McKellan a GOD? That is an amazing gift you have there Pyro. You are a God among insects, never forget that.<BR>7) I could go on and on...<br />The Look... it's all about the look<BR>1) Costuming and sets were fabulous (how cold must Rebecca Stamos have been in that snow scene?)<BR>2) It was nice that they picked up where the last movie left off... it gave a nice sense of completion.<br />That's my two cents. If you read this and haven't seen the movie, shame on you... you've ruined a great flick for yourself
0805062971|1.0|O my god this is easily the worst book I have ever read in my life...  It just has one stupid idea and it beats it to death.  The main theme is that you're not a consumer if you get into fights.  Who told this guy he could write?  It seems like he wrote this in a week.
0345451325|5.0|When I picked up The Fall of Reach, I expected a fairly amateurish attempt to make a prequel to Halo. I was pleasantly surprised. Eric Nylund obviously put a lot of thought into the thing, and it shows. The book is a believable and knowledgable, staying close to the story of Halo while adding in interesting background information.
B00008NG5V|5.0|any fan of jack johnson will love this one. the guitar riffs on this cd are identical to tracks on Brushfire Fairytales, but the lyrics are more meaningful. you can tell as soon as you hear the opening track, \\"times like these\\" that its just going to be a good, kick back and mellow-out cd....
B00008NG5V|4.0|On and On was made for lazy summer days by the pool or on a sun drenched deck with a pitcher of Bud Light. &quot;Holes to Heaven&quot; is  the best song on this album - it's just so damn groovy.

B000002GQE|5.0|Whether you're a fan of the Moodies or not, this is a landmark album for both them and the history of rock and roll music.  It's the first album to feature front-men Justin Hayward and John Lodge who became the driving force of the group. Is this my favorite Moodies album?  No.  Is it their best?  Yes.<BR>The album features British conductor Peter Knight, whom the Moodies never actually worked with on the prodcut, but rather shipped it to him in bits and pieces to orchestrate and already phenomenal album.  When this project began they were working on Dvorak's New World Symphony and came up with this instead.  It was one of the first albums to be featured in QUADRAPHONIC sound, if you remember that technology at all.<BR>It features their hits Tuesday Afternoon and Nights In White Satin.  If you like it I encourage you to check out both Seventh Sojourn and On The Threshold Of A Dream.
B00004ZD69|5.0|Keeping it simple. An intriguing piece, not for the faint of heart, and by that I mean you can't sit around telling fish stories and only half listen to something like this. They do an excellent job of bridging the divide between 'serious' progressive music and pop. Fans of Sonic Youth, Dvorck's (sp) 9th, and Radio Head Kid A and Amnesiac will enjoy this album. If you're craving a true LISTENING experience this is the way to go, play it on something capable of good sound reproduction.
B0000931OG|4.0|Though the album sounds different than their previous albums, it's just as good (if not better) than most. Any open-minded Blur fan should love this offering. The high points are definitely Crazy Beat, Ambulance, Gene by Gene, and We've Got a File On You. I think the cd could have been done without the track Caravan, but still, it's a killer album by a killer band
0553573403|5.0|This may be a tale of grey skies, windswept castles that have seen better days, undeserved tragedy, and frequent violence, but those darker qualities are balanced by a lightning quick pace, likable traits in many of the characters (though precious few characters are all good or all bad), and even some humor.  I started this series to kill time while waiting for the next \\"Wheel of Time\\" book by Robert Jordan, and was surprised by not only its quality, but its complete lack of \\"slow\\" parts (a facet of Jordan's writing one has to get used to).  Also, though there's not a lot of \\"fantasy\\" per se in this first volume, wait 'til you see the final scene!  On those last couple of pages, Martin certainly delivers a memorable scene of drama and enchantment to whet your appetite for volume two.  Which I'm just about to start.
0671027344|5.0|This book was very touching in a way that most books are not. The main character, Charlie is a very emotional kid, he's a freshman, but he sounds much younger because he is innocent and honest. He offers observations and thoughts about everything he sees around him in a beautiful way. He cries about every other page, and he had me doing the same. This book was nostalgic for me, and I think whether or not you can relate to Charlie, you will find yourself reliving the experience of growing up. Mostly it is about feelings, the ones you wish would last forever that are always outweighed by the ones you wish you never had to have.  I recommend this book as a break from the everyday reality to focus on the things that are really important in your life, and the lives of those you love.
0446310786|5.0|When I first heard that our English teacher was going to assign this book to be read by the end of the year, my first thought was \\"Great, another boring assignment.\\" I changed my mind, however, when we started to read to book. After receiving some background info, I understood this book perfectly. We just finished reading it, and I must say, tha teachers of Palm Bch County, FL know how to pick 'em!<BR>Six-year-old Scout is the narrator of this story. Her brother, Jem, is four years older, and a loyal son to their father Atticus. Atticus is an attorney who is asked to defend a black man named Tom Robinson when he is accused of raping Mayella Ewell, a poor farmer's daughter. This book contains it all: love and hate, black and white, the good, the bad, and the ugly.<BR>I'm glad that my teacher picked this one!
B00008NG5V|5.0|Once again he does it.  It is such a breath of fresh air to have an artist that actually knows how to write and play good music.
B000092Q4U|5.0|Best heavy album of the year hands down.  It was worth the wait!!!
B00006CXXU|5.0|Being a lover of all types/genres of music, i have to say that this is the best CD i have heard in a LONG LONG time.  Who ever would have thought that this 'genie' was capable of this??  Christina incorporates at least 5 genres into her newest (and best) effort..  Latin, Soul, Pop, R&amp;B, Gospel.. what more can you ask for?  Her voice gives me chills, and the stories she tells through her music have a tendency to wrench my heartstrings.  <BR>     She speaks truth through her music, something more so-called *singers* need to do.
B00008LDPU|5.0|I have gotten a sneak peak at ALL of the Animatrix episodes and each one of them is AMAZING. They are really a work of art and you finally see that things are not as black and white as they may seem. And you ask yourself who the real bad guys are, humans or the machines. This is really a must own for all anime lovers and all those that have seen the matrix. And just for the record this is my first anime I have seen, since I don't ever watch them or like them, but this truly is a great movie.<br />Picture: It's great, you can't expect too much. It's perfect DVD quality, doesn't get better than that.<br />Sound: Very good. You're not getting 5.1 but it's still very good.<br />Features: None that I have seen, so I can't rate it at the moment.
B00008PW3Q|4.0|I find myself rooting desperately for the commercial singles on this cd to hit the airwaves, just so that the public at large will be exposed to the buried gems on this disc. I think \\"Everyone Finds Out\\" is nothing short of incredible. Lindsey outdoes Stevie's trademark gypsiness with his haunting \\"Miranda,\\" my second favorite tune.  I love its Arabian mystique, with the lyrics giving you entree into someone else's darkness --which viewed through a crazed mind appears (and sounds) light -- that reminds me of \\"Angie Baby,\\" perhaps.  Although the 2 songs are utterly different in tone and mood, I find Lindsey's guitar riffs on \\"Miranda\\" quite reminiscent of \\"Sweet Girl.\\"<br />I don't understand exactly why \\"Peacekeeper\\" was chosen as the first single. Perhaps, Warner Reprise just felt that at this stage in America's history anything referencing the war would sell. I don't agree and can hardly wait until the contagious \\"Say You Will\\" and \\"Thrown Down\\" are released, so that this treasure of an album does not quickly fade off of the Billboard charts and into Rock and Roll footnote oblivion, before getting a fair chance.<br />The lyrics of \\"Everybody Finds Out\\" resonate like some of Stevie's best. I place the song's adulturous musings among Stevie's best: \\"When love starts out in the darkness, it doesn't do well in the light. Affairs of the heart that start ou in the dark usually stay with the night.\\" Those words stay with me, just as surely as \\"players only love you when they're playing\\" do. Moreover, the tale told is psychologically compelling. The protagonist's attitude is defiant, but the tone is belied by the truth. She only has him \\"most of the time.\\" Yes, they have each other anywhere and anytime, but never in public. How great can their love be, if it's a dirty secret? There's never going to be a day when \\"everybody finds out,\\" and that silent fear is what forces the false bravado to ring more intensely, as Lindsey chimes in at the end, sharing lead vocals. Such ariveting audio cries out to be sung on stage. The vanity (\\"he says he adores me, what can I say\\"), the self-delusion, the rocking beat . . . Can't get enough of this tune. Get away, get away...<br />Even if the single \\"Say You Will\\" is too pop, it reminds me of Christine -- and that's never a bad thing. I was never a rabid fan of Christine's. I always liked Stevie's mystical songs most, admired Lindsay's production talents and just thought that Christine rounded the other two out nicely. Without her on the album I suddenly realize how important \\"rounding\\" is. Broccoli may not be my favorite food, but if you serve me a meal of chocolate cake and steak, I suddenly start craving the green stuff, aka Ms. Perfect.  I embrace \\"Say You Will\\" as a tribute to Christine's infectious diddies (i.e. \\"Say You Love Me\\"), but it's not just fluff by any means.<br />The lyrics speak of that kind of love most of us are familiar with, when you want a person more for what they bring out in you, than you do for them. It's not that you become what the other person sees in you. It's that dormant parts of yourself rise to meet, complement and supplement that other person. When the other person leaves, you're left -- not unfulfilled or incomplete -- but untapped. That part of you becomes inaccessible again. It's like they say we only use 10% of our brains. When you meet someone who probes a percentage of those dark unused parts, it's hard to lose them and see that extra part of your brain closed off again. You want them to bring back that 'passion, fever dance'. The words are great. The tune stays with you and when the arrangement breaks down at the end so that all you hear is the high-pitched back up vocals, the fundamentality of it strikes me right to the core, making me want to hear the whole song again -- just to be brought back to that basic point. <br />I do think the cd is too long. At least 4 songs should have been cut. But hey, it's a lot easier to skip the tedious tracks with a cdplayer than it was on my phonograph back when Tusk came out.
B0000931OL|5.0|THIS IS THE BEST BLUR ALBUM! I would sugest you buy this album you won't regret it.
B000068QY7|4.0|From a band that has given us hit single after hit single after hit single, we should expect nothing short of amazing when it comes to their music.  And in Oasis' case, they really delivered the goods with Heathen Chemistry, a CD that seemed to come out of nowhere.  There was no prominent radio hit like a \\"Wonderwall\\" or \\"Don't Go Away\\", and no real publicity.  And still, many of these tracks are shockingly great; a few among Oasis' best ever recorded.  Some of these songs sound a bit more folk-ish and laid back compared to previous albums.  And that's okay.  Beautiful, melody-induced songs like \\"Stop Crying Your Heart Out\\" and \\"She Is Love\\" and the timeless \\"Songbird\\" are definite gems amidst Oasis` history.  Whereas their everyday, classic rock `n' roll echo is carried out brilliantly in songs like \\"Force Of Nature\\" and \\"The Hindu Times\\".  With that being said, here's an overview of the 11 tracks:<br />1. The Hindu Times - 4.5/5 - the opener reminds me (a lot) of \\"Rock `N' Roll Star\\"; as both have that brit-rock Oasis sound we know all so well.  Not only is it reminiscent of that one song, it's also similar to the entire Definitely Maybe album.  Leads into...<br />2. Force Of Nature - 5/5 - ...probably my favorite song on the whole album.  The lyrics here are hands down the best.  The chorus is very smart, yet it makes you laugh at the same time, with: `you're smokin all my stash / but burning all my cash...'.  It's a great sing-along track.<br />3. Hung In A Bad Place - 3.5/5 - although this is a very good song, it's too alike the previous two to really stand out as great.  Oddly enough, the first three songs here carry out most of Heathen Chemisty's harder rock sound.<br />4. Stop Crying Your Heart Out - 5/5 - there is no question this is one of Oasis' best songs ever.  It's just so amazing, both lyrically and musically, that you can't help but love it.  The provocative piano and booming background repeats add to the vividness in Noel's voice.<br />5. Songbird - 5/5 - being just over two minutes, it's very hard to look at this song and say it's the best.  Nevertheless it's still amazing.  I hinted to the fact of folk appearing on Heathen, and this is where that variety is primarily brought out.<br />6. Little By Little - 5/5 - compared to all the rest, \\"Little By Little\\" is rather diverse.  It has a very melodic beginning, but picks up to reveal more rock and roll.  I guess, little by little (tasteless, I know), the eminence of the song really progresses.<br />7. A Quick Peep - 3/5 - even though you could consider this one-minute, instrumentally smart track to be only filler, it acts as a neat introduction to...<br />8. (Probably) All In The Mind - 4/5 - `Show me who you are / I'll show you what you love' is how this song begins.  It's a smart song lyrically, and the music is shaped around the words rather nicely.  However, it's not quite perfect.<br />9. She Is Love - 5/5 - this one operates very much like \\"Songbird\\", but it's a bit longer.  And therefore it really stands out.  Take note of the hand-claps, something that you may remember from The Masterplan's \\"Half The World Away\\".  It's similar to that one as well: slow, and great.<br />10. Born On A Different Cloud - 4.25/5 - here we have a great song that reminds me of the Standing On The Shoulders Of Giants b-side \\"Let's All Make Believe\\"; which is one of my favorite Oasis tracks of all-time.  It starts wonderfully, but doesn't develop into (pure) greatness.<br />11. Better Man - 4/5 - I think it was very fitting for Oasis to end this CD with a more rock `n' rolled track.  Fans who appreciate songs like \\"Headshrinker\\" and \\"Magic Pie\\" will love this one.  But alas, this might actually feature Heathen Chemistry's most simplistic lyrics.<br />xx. Hidden Track - 3/5 - if you choose to skip to the VERY (and I do mean `VERY') end of \\"Better Man\\", you'll get to hear another good instrumental track.  Although its tune is very enjoyable and refined, I usually don't enjoy holding down the fast forward button for over two minutes.<br />When you look back and compare Heathen Chemistry to previous Oasis releases, it doesn't quite measure up to all of them.  That is the only reason I gave it just 4.5 stars instead of five.  This CD just doesn't seem to have as much energy and lasting power as their earlier work did.  But to the Oasis diehard, that shouldn't really matter.  Classic tracks like \\"Stop Crying Your Heart Out\\" and \\"Force Of Nature\\" will probably go down as many people's favorites (at least they should).  Do not let the laid back, folk feel of Heathen Chemistry allow you to ignore it.  This is an amazing release from a popular `90s band trying to make themselves heard in the `00s.  Finally, as if this matters, I'd put this album at #4 in ranking Oasis' now six studio CDs; behind only (What`s The Story) Morning Glory, The Masterplan, and Be Here Now.  Ignore all the abusive reviews and buy this.ing down the fast forward button for over two minutes.<br />When you look back and compare Heathen Chemistry to previous Oasis releases, it doesn't quite measure up to all of them.

Do not let the laid back, folk feel of Heathen Chemistry allow you to ignore it.  This is an amazing release from a popular `90s band trying to make themselves heard in the `00s.  Finally, as if this matters, I'd put this album at #4 in ranking Oasis' now six studio CDs; behind only (What`s The Story) Morning Glory, The Masterplan, and Be Here Now.  Ignore all the abusive reviews and buy this.
B0000931OL|5.0|This is one of the best BLUR albums ever!
B00008NG5V|5.0|Just what the doctor ordered for summer!  Many people now knock Jack for being too hyped & bubble-gummy.  Whatever....  These are such simple laid back grooves that cannot be better for a mellow flipflop wearin', Corona flavored, sunshine beamin', sand in your shorts kinda day!  Just makes ya wanna get outta the rat race & chill on the beach with friends.  JUST what the world needs!... Go get this & get your mind in vacation mode!!
B00008NG5V|5.0|Jack Johnson's newest release is from the vein of Brushfire Fairytales, but can still please any listener, old and new. JJ has developed a formula for his writing, and if it isn't broke then don't fix it. Cookie Jar shows violence from our youth as a result of the media in Cookie Jar, singing &quot;you can't blame me says the media man/i wasn't the one who came up with the plan/i just point that camera at what the people want to see/it's a two way mirror and you can't blame me&quot;. Dreams be dreams is nice ballad stating &quot;her dreams are dreams/all this living is so much harder than it seems/but girl don't let your dreams be dreams&quot;. Holes To Heaven, familiar to fans as Stars off the Brushfire Fairytales demo cd, has a driving bass/vocal melody that will make it an instant favorite, at least for me it was. It reminds me of Pulp's song Mile End which I know of only as being off the Trainspotting Soundtrack. Overall this cd is absolutley fantastic. Songs like Taylor, Tommorrow Morning, Gone, and Rodeo Clowns all offer an easily catchy sound that is owned by JJ. On and On, along with Brushfire Fairytales are 2 great offering from JJ that noone should pass up.
0792844890|5.0|I see you have the ring, and your swartz is as big as mine! This is the funniest movie I have ever seen. I could probably recite the whole movie for you by memory, but what fun would that be. Just go out and watch it. You must buy it. It is a superior classic. Mel brookes is absolutely hilarious in this movie. Go buy it!
0385507755|4.0|This book is about addiction and a man fighting to find his way out of the abyss through his own means, and not that of a prescribed 12 step program or guidance from a Higher Being.  Frey is an angry, arrogant, existentialist.  Frey makes no excuses, and accepts the consequences of his actions.  Frey seeks to control his &quot;Fury.&quot; His addictions are just the symptons of his Fury. <br />The writing is unique and undisciplined, much like Frey.  It's obvious that, as in his writing and life, Frey detests rules and authority.  Frey is a compelling, loyal nihilist.  It's not a book where you find yourself cheering for the protaganist as he &quot;slays&quot; his addictions for a new life of sobriety; rather, you find yourself wondering if and when will Frey again succumb to his Demons. I would like more from Frey about his life now; his temptations; and his &quot;Fury.&quot;
0375432302|2.0|... The DaVinci Code rehashes a clever idea - but that's about all it has going for it.  The characters are two-dimensional at best:  the villain played by religious zealot albino, the angry French cop named \\"Fache\\" with a gaze that 'scorches the earth as he walks', the protagonist with little more to him than his description as \\"Harrison Ford in tweed\\".  The plot is predictable from the first chapter, the suspense non-existent, the dialog tedious and pedantic. ... It's certainly not going to threaten any religious establishments.  This book was borderline painful to read.  Don't be fooled - at least read the first chapter before you buy it.  You'll be able to tell in the first ten pages if it's for you or not.
B000089RVX|5.0|This album is unlike anything else I have ever listened to. The truly amazing vocals of Amy Lee add to the almost chilling background music to create a band that is one of if not the best band in the world. The CD has tracks that are good to just kinda let go with as well as lighter songs that really show Amy Lee's voice...
0385504209|3.0|While I find myself unable to put this book down, I wish I had not started it. The writing is poor and hackneyed and I have no emotional attachment to the characters. Most of the time it reads like a bad Sandra Bullock movie. An albino villain--COME ON! But the concept, if poorly executed, is still intruiging and I DO want to know what happens. If you haven't read it yet, don't start...that is if you don't want to sit there with a paradoxical reaction--groaning at the cheesiness of it but unable to stop reading.
B00008H2LE|5.0|For starters, BUY THIS ALBUM!! If you were into limp bizkit but thought they were too HIP HOP, you'll love linkin park.  With the exception of one song chester sings by himself and one song that showcases Mike's rhymes, they combine Chester's powerful voice and Mike's smooth raps to perfection.  It is a masterful blend of rock quitar riffs with a hip hop bounce.  It has something for everyone.  Trust me, you won't wanna pass this one up.
B000092Q4U|4.0|This album is a solid definition of metal. There are no melodies, no soft or tender moments, just straight metal.<BR>If you ever listened to new american gospel or burn the priest and enjoyed those albums, this one will not dissapoint at all. If youve been looking for a band that can deliver good ol' metal with no chaser or filler...then look no further
B00008J2DQ|5.0|After a quick change in line-up, Godsmack is back and rising to the top of the music scene. Sadly, Tommy Stewart left the band last summer, but their new drummer Shannon Larkin is definitely a choice replacement. In their new CD Faceless, Sully Erna's empassioned voice and new range in vocals adds new acheivement for the band. It is the strong emotion in Sully's voice that perhaps holds one of the key ingredients to Godsmack's unique sound. They aren't following the same sound as almost every other band of today- trying to achieve the grunge sound of Nirvana or the \\"punk\\" bands that sound more like pop music with guitars. No. The anger flows from Sully Erna's voice with such intensity, such passion, that we know it is  for real. The infectious, yet heavy guitar rifts played by Tony Rombola keep the songs stuck in your head. While on songs like \\"The Awakening\\" Shannon Larkin's drumming adds the tribal tone to the music. And Robbie Merrill's bass drifts through the songs, giving them the very cohesiveness they need as the final touch. We hear blazing hatred in \\"I F****** Hate You\\" and mysticism in \\"Serenity\\" and \\"The Awakening\\". In other songs like \\"I Stand Alone\\", \\"Faceless\\" and \\"Releasing The Demons\\" we hear the anthem of letting go and of absolute freedom. Godsmack shows what the music scene of today has potential to become. ... So who do we look to as role models for good music? Listen to the new CD Faceless and you will know the answer. A band different from the rest and more dedicated to their fans, music, and just plain having fun than to corporations and money. They worked their asses off to get where they are today, and they plan on sticking around. So the world beware- there is real music on the scene now. One listen to Godsmack's new cd Faceless, and music will be redefined in your eyes.
B000002KKC|5.0|I must say this album has aged well, however it does scream to be remastered, not just for an unedited \\"Sara\\" but the difference in sound quality from vinyl to cd is vast. The vinyl sounds rich and clear but the cd sounds muddy. (are you listening Warner Bros.?)<br />Now to the songs... Some people say this album is uneven. Maybe.<BR>But in it's uneveness lies it's beauty. The 20 songs though written by 3 different people flow together to make up a flawless album. I've been listening to this since it first came out in 1979. There is not a bad song here. The 5 Stevie songs are incredible. Maybe her best ever. \\"Storms\\" and \\"Angel\\" are hauntingly beautiful. <br />Christine's songs are gorgeous and both \\"Brown Eyes\\" and \\"Think About Me\\" are very passionate. But it's the Lindsey Buckingham songs that make this album special. He intertwines his songs with Stevie's and Christine's to create a musical atmosphere unlike any other album they ever did. Almost like a pretty painting or sunset with many layers that just gets better the deeper you look. The background vocals are amazing and the playing is stellar. It may take multiple listenings but at some point you will hear the brilliance.<br />Lindsey Buckingham is a master guitar player, producer, writer, and vocalist. Hear him weave his magic on \\"The Ledge\\", \\"What makes you think you're the one\\", \\"That's all for everyone\\", \\"Not that funny\\", \\"Walk a Thin Line\\", and \\"That's enough for me\\".<br />To me this album is comparable to the \\"White Album\\" and \\"Physical Graffiti\\". It is long, sprawling, edgey, hip, experimental and rewards many listens. By the way Mick Fleetwood and John McVie never sounded better as a rhythm section.<br />\\"Rumours\\" may have sold more and \\"Fleetwood Mac\\" may get better reviews but \\"TUSK\\" is the one that won't leave my CD player. So run, don't walk to your nearest store and pick this one up. Years from now you will thank me.
B0000931OL|4.0|Good song &quot;Out of time&quot; ... and &quot;Crazy beat&quot; is so Wowderful...<BR>Well done ...
B000092Q4U|3.0|I just picked up the cd about 2 hours ago and I have listened through the entire cd at least once.  First of this cd is different from 'New American Gospel' but not in a bad way.  I want to say its slower but its not it seems to in a way take you to a place and keep you there for each song.  The riffs arent simplistic but they seem over used throughout each song.  This is a metal cd and I'm more of a metalcore, gridcore, hardcore type of guy so im used to sparatic guitar changes and tempos and whatnot.  I've loved log ever since i heard them back in 2000.  Im sure this cd will be at the top of my collection once it grows on me.
0060090383|3.0|I do feel hijacked by the blurbs and my own expectations after reading 'Watermelon' and 'Angels.'  This isn't a humorous novel so much as an addict tract, full of specious psychologizing and spurious AA conventional wisdom.  Invited to a party, I wound up at a sermon.  The material escaped from MK's control at some point, and she went along for the ride.  (And yet you read it in a quick four sittings, didn't you, John?)
B00003CXC6|5.0|Rashomon was the second Akira Kurosawa film I have seen after Yojimbo and I am proud to call it my best film experience so far. The plot is amazing and leaves the audience stunned with its mystery long after the film has ended. <br />The screenplay and photography is wonderfull along with the incredibly amazing acting staff that really gave me a new perspective on films and how strong they seem. I really love this movie and is recommended very strongly.<br />Without doubt, this is one of the most wonderfull films to ever exist. Watch it and be prepared for a emotional experience
B00006CXXU|5.0|This is an incredible album..christina has got it all...but it's her voice and the way she delivers her songs that sends chills up my spine...she's incredible...the album is incredible..<br />5 stars...
B000000WJZ|5.0|If only they invented 6 stars..................... Dont listen to a bad review of this album...... ITS A CLASSIC. Every rock n roll fan should own this.
B00006JJ1O|4.0|when i first heard the song all the things she said... i thought it rocked then i saw the video and it didn't shock me..but it shocked alot of my friends...i have no idea why it's so shocking to see two girls kissing when there is so much shocking images on the tele these days. but get pass the the shocking image...and you listen to the cd and you will be surprised how good the cd is...it rocks...
B0000787FH|5.0|Simply the best record ever made since the time of Revolver and Sgt.Pepper's
B0000035E7|5.0|All of Nirvana's albums are phenomenal, but Bleach is the best.  This album exhibits the raw energy that made Nirvana, and especially Kurt Cobain, famous.  The quality of the recording isn't the best, but it adds to the rough, unrefined quality that defines Nirvana.  This album is a must have for any fan.
B00008S2VG|3.0|At best, I'd describe this album as \\"EH\\"... Lyrically, it's nothing to brag about - but Madonna's never really been the best writer in the world - & \\"Music\\" really proved that. But no one ever really cared because her music & delivery always took us exactly where we wanted to be - no matter where I was - on the dance floor, at work, in my car, or in my living room - I had her music blasting... but this album just doesn't grab me like any of her others did... but as I always do w/ any piece of music by any favorite artist, I'll give it another listen or two to see if it \\"grows\\" on me. One never knows...
B00008PW3Q|5.0|As I read over some of the reviews, I can't believe how many people are so stuck in the past. Fleetwood Mac continued on, and Christine decided she no longer wanted to be involved. Mick,John,Stevie, and Lindsey have produced an incredible cd without Christine. This is classic Fleetwood Mac, minus the 70's pop keyboard. It is a much more raw, musical effort. I have also read where people are continuing to say that some of the song writing is too abstract...????? Is it Fleetwood Macs problem that some listeners have a very limited brain capacity. And as far as the length of the cd.... How can more music for the money be bad. I still dont' get that one..... especially since there isn't a bad song on the cd. Yes, I do agree that some tracks are better than others, but not one bad track at all. Standout cuts: Throwdown, Say you will, Miranda, Peacekeeper,Running through the garden, everybody finds out, and destiny rules......... A+++++ album. I can't wait until the next effort from these guys. Long live the Mac
B00005JKPF|5.0|there is so much to tlak about x2 that i could fill this whole space.  the action is a lot higher in this movie and the story fits so well that this movie garners multiple viewings.  in x-men 1 bryan singer had to introduce all the characters and their powers to all fo the x-men neophytes, which is understandable.  but he wastes no time on introduction in this movie.  in my opinion the opening scene with nightcrawler is the best sequence in the movie.  singer has shown nightcrawler in a way that could not be done in the pages of comic books.  watching nightcrawler teleport so fast and efficiently is simply breathtaking.  the action does not stop there either, singer jumps right into the assault on xavier's school.  at this point you get to see wolverine finally cut loose...  plus singer gives you a buffet of characters from the books.  colossus powereing up and turning into steel is very cool, siryn is also cool when she cuts loose with her voice, there are just so many to go over.  iceman is one of my favorite characters from the comics as well as in the movies, he just hits all the right notes for me.  i love when he creates his ice wall.  in the next movie they should show iceman completely ice his body like in the comics, it would be too cool.  jean and storm go off to find nightcrawler, and he breaks your heart.  it is sad to see someone so pure and likeable taken advantage of and made to do evil by people such as william stryker.  however by the end of the movie you love him with all his heart because he is such a good person with a soul made out of pure gold.  i have not forgotten about magneto either, unfortunately he is taken advantage by stryker also but i love the way he breaks out of prison, he may be bad but he is bad in all the right ways.  mystique rocks also, she is so cool it is beyond words.  especially as she flips off the guards at the dam while slithering behind the door.  also take a look at the computer screen when she looks at stryker's files, you will see many names of x-characters fro the comics, the on i saw most clearly was jamie maddox, the multiple man.  also keep a look out fro mystique as rebeccas romijn stamos in the bar with the security guard, on the tv in the bar you see a human henry mccoy a.k.a the beast.  the scene at bobby drake's house is also entertaining and educational.  the comics have always made the point of how different people are treated simply for their differences.  when his mother asks him if he has tried not being a mutant, it is reminicent of the same question homosexuals encounter when asked have you tried not to be gay.  his brother proceeds to call the police, in an display of stupidity whene someone panics when confronted with something they do not understand.  pyro really gets to show off here as well as rogue.  when pyro cuts loose and almost kills people rogue saves the day by absorbing pyros power to control flame and put the fires out.  in the x-jet all the x-men almost die except storm unleashes a plethora of tornadoes to shake the plains in pursuit of the x-men.  jean also steps in the try and disarm the missiles, and almost accomplishes this feet, but they are forced to be saved by magneto, ironically.  although magneto helps the xmen he also has alternative plans, like any smart bad guy.  the fight b/w wolverine and deathstryke is a highlight of the movie, its kinda nice to see wolverine get[s] whooped a little bit.  at the end it is awesome to see jean really use her power to its fullest extent in order to save the day.  singer also gives you a clue as to his plans for a third movie, all i can say is the phoenix.  there is humor through out the movie also.  the humor is very subtle but is timed perfectly.  my favorite funny part was when magneto and mystique are snickering like school girls at rogue and then tell her that they love what she did to her hair.  people who are ian mckellen fans will pick up on the truly ironic funniness of the statement.  but rogue is hilarious when she is ready to fight both of them right then and then there and takes her gloves off.  x2 has all the right elements of a great summer blockbuster.  it has action, humor, depth, sincerity, and [great] charcters and story.  go see this movie 800 times and enjoy yourself the whole time every time you see it.  i dont see how anyone could be disappointed by this film, my prediction is it will be the best movie of the summer, but note i have not seen the matrix reloaded yet so after i see that, i will be able to judge which will be the best.  see ya at the theater.
B00008I8IF|5.0|OK...I've been a fan of the Jayhawks for over many years now. I truly love Tomorrow the Green Grass and also enjoyed many of the songs on Smile, but this is definitely one of their best records. It's a complete album which works from beginning to end. On some songs they sound like throwbacks to the days of CSNY and America. Other times they have a tinge of the more modern Wilco. Stand out tracks include: Tailspin, Save It For A Rainy Day, Eyes of Sarahjane, and Don't Let the World Get In Your Way. This is definitely one of the best albums of the year!
B00005A0V0|4.0|Well , not exactly 'drum and bass' in modern terminology , but this album is characterised by the excellent drumming of Coughlan - should have seen him live - , and solid bass of Sinclair combining to give music that can only best be appreciated if you tend to crank up the bass on the hifi with some decent speakers.<br />After having listened to it for the past thirty years , I still don't get tired of it , though it must be said some of the musical progression is quite predictable and slow-moving.<br />Pye Hastings is a little McCartney(!) like . He can write really good stuff , but his tendency to whimsy should not be encouraged - hence you get singalong tracks like \\"Love to Love You\\" ...<br />Caravan really changed my musical outlook when I first heard \\"If I could do it all over again ...\\" - so radically different from the pop charts. Land of Grey and Pink consolidated my view of the band but after \\"Girls who grow plump ... \\" I lost interest.<br />However , this work stands up well to the test of time and I would recommend it to anyone.<br />SO refreshing to hear lyrics NOT being sung in a mid-Atlantic accent.
6300216403|5.0|There is no question....this is one of the best ever....I never get enough of this film....I suppose it relates very much to the fact that my daughter and I have seen it so many times over the years and we almost know the words by heart....this is must see classic stuff.....thanks Tatum &amp; Ryan...
B000002B7M|5.0|Ozzy has always been a leader in his genre of music, from having new bands open for him throughout his career and Ozzfest. But his largest effect has been from his own music. Even from the days as the front man for Black Sabbith he was bound to leave his mark on the industry in more than just tattoos and word bleeps. \\"Blizzard of Ozz\\" was his first album leaving the Black Sabbath boys behind. Ozzy made the leap into super-stardom, where Sabbath could not. <br />What luck Ozzy had in finding the young Randy Rhodes on guitar. Until his unfortunate death, he was well on his way to become a premier guitarist. A flare for his classical side is seen in the brief instrumental \\"Dee\\". The album is packed with great tracks, nearly all of them are considered classics, and a must have for all hard rock lovers. \\"Crazy Train\\", \\"Goodbye to Romance\\" and \\"I Don't Know\\" proved to all Sabbath fans that Ozzy would easily make it on his own. The now infamous \\"Suicide Solution\\" in all of its hemisynch glory appears on this album. <br />In the history of music, this album is one that marks the spot where hard rock crossed over into mainstream radio play. Metal bands exploded onto the seen after this album, and neglected greats, like Alice Cooper, found themselves suddenly in the spotlight. Ozzy changed the face of music, and has continued to do so to this day.
B000059TEP|5.0|The best part of this flick is after the bad guys get croaked, and they're just laying there, and then their evil spirit-selves arise and walk around.  Suddenly, the shadows here and there start moaning, and then they take dark form and manifest themselves as a squad of demons who then carry the bad person off to Big H where he is forced to watch Patrick Swayze and Demi Moore films for eternity as punishment for his wrongdoings.  I wondered about the shadow beings, though.  Are they other souls who died previously and were bad, and now they're in Hades?  The thing is, it looks like what they get to do -- go after sinners who have just croaked, and drag 'em back to Hades -- is somewhat fun, and I didn't think you're supposed to have any fun in Hades unless you are the boss (see \\"Rosemary's Baby\\").  I think it would be great to scare the daylights out of an evil dead guy, then drag him down to the bottomless pit.  If I land in the Big H, that's the job for which I will apply.  Certainly couldn't be worse than payroll accounting.
B00004XONN|5.0|The fun in this record is to listen to the impression you get from the words being sung, and compare them to the impression given to you from the music.  I'll list a few songs as examples:<br />In \\"Everything In Its Right Place,\\" compare the numbing, robotic lyrics to the building tension and the wisps of random chatter fluttering about.  These are not words spoken by someone whose life is completely organized.  An organized, productive life can't completely kill thought, as much as we'd like it to.<br />In \\"The National Anthem,\\" listen to the words: they speak of massive numbers of disillusioned, isolated and hopeless people.  But the music is not sad.  The music seems to be a living, organic thing, full of improvisation and excitement.  The addition of a free-jazz wind section was a very calculated move.  So everyone ends up sad and alone, right?  No.  Something big and chaotic and frightening is coming from all those sad, disillusioned people.<br />In \\"Idioteque\\" (possibly the most startling song on the album), compare the cutting, ranting lyrics with the dance beat.  Is this really a celebration of the culture surrounding dance music?  Or is it an indictment of party-fatigued candy ravers, dancing and hugging and blathering on their mobile phones while the world is dying all around them?  \\"I laugh until my head comes off...I swallow till I burst...Ice age coming...Here, I'm allowed everything all of the time.\\"<br />Lastly, the song \\"Motion Picture Soundtrack\\" takes a simple ballad format, the kind of music that has the potential to turn into a classic sentimental torch-song a la Jeff Buckley's \\"Lover, You Should've Come Over,\\" and sends a decidedly non-sentimental message: if God exists, He is quite possibly mad, and humanity would only be looking out for itself if it asked for a divorce.<br />All in all, a profound album, and something new can be retrieved from it on every listen.
0316666343|4.0|Although very upsetting, this book is so artfully plotted and uses such a unique point of view. I've passed it along to my dad, my brother, and my therapist to read!
B000088E6D|5.0|At first, I thought his version of \\"Fever\\" sounded kinda weird.<BR>However after listening to this CD couple of times, I am totally <BR>addicted to it! Although this CD's might be a little bit old-<BR>fashioned to some fellows, but it's a fresh and enjoyable music <BR>experience to me.
B00006J9OT|5.0|I think I now own all the recordings available.  Live deserved the Grammy.  I recently bought the new Heartdrops CD By Diana Krall and next to it, Live is my second choice for best Krall vocal CD.  Two must have CDs by the soon to be Mrs. Elvis Costello.
B0000025ZK|4.0|You can take a guy out of Floyd, but you can't take the Floyd out of the guy. That's probably an unfair statement since Floyd is, in part, what David Gilmour brings to the band. Gilmour's sound is unique and easy to recognize. Clear phrasing and astral sound are his trademarks. His solos are perfect, works of art that elicit images and emotions. \\"About Face\\" is different from a Floyd album, and at the same time very similar to one. This was he first release after the demise of the band, allowing him to experiment and do his own thing without having to clash with others. It is this freedom that separates this album from the true Floyd sound.<br />\\"Murder\\" is a good resume for Gilmour's talent. The song begins with acoustic strumming before a fretless bass solo marks the transition to a heavier feel. The solo is powerfully Gilmour. As the solo progresses it turns more into something that sounds like it was cut from \\"The Wall\\", a bit \\"Young Lust\\"-ish. The surprising song on the album is \\"Love On the Air\\", one of two on this album penned by Pete Townsend. Again, Gilmour takes center stage with his guitar, but there is some pretty good Hammond organ going on in the background. \\"All Lovers Are Deranged\\" is the other Townsend song. This one is quit heavier, and Gilmour's playing a bit on the dirty side. \\"Out of the Blue\\" borrows heavily from the Floyd arsenal. Gilmour gets a lick back on Waters with \\"You Know I'm Right\\". <br />Overall, this is a decent solo release from Gilmour, which is a precursor to revitalizing most of Floyd for \\"Momentary Lapse of Reason\\". It's a good showing, but not his best work. He proved that he could work without Waters on his first solo release (self-titled), and did again with the subsequent releases from Floyd.
B00008NG5V|5.0|This is a must have...no matter what kind of mood you're in, throw in this disk and day dream away.  When listening you need to look beyond his catchy tunes. His political views are right on. <br />We all need to open our eyes and get proactive.<br />Jack Johnson for President.
B00005JLRT|3.0|Star Trek Nemesis isn't a horrible film, and it isn't a great film...it's just...there... If you try to dissect this film too closely, glaring plot holes and plot devices will jump out at you. Why were those Scorpion-class attack fighters on Shinzon's Scimitar? Answer: to get Picard and Data off of the ship. Why not use them against the Enterprise? I would assume that any sane military commander would use all of his available resources to win... Not Shinzon. This is the sort of \\"fanboy\\" idiocy you get with a John Logan script.<br />For anyone who wants to know what Star Trek: The Next Generation was really all about, watch the TV episodes. The Next Generation was arguably the most cerebral Trek series ever, though a case can be made for Deep Space Nine and its metaphysical threads. The series never relied on action to carry its stories, and very rarely practiced sloppy storytelling. Instead of building on the events of each film to craft some sort of coherent and thought provoking ongoing series, the Next Generation films have been little more than one-shot TV episodes - with Nemesis barely beating out Insurrection for third best Next Generation film, First Contact and Generations are my personal favorites.<br />If you want to see Patrick Stewart play Captain Picard as an intelligent, charming and witty explorer/diplomat, watch the TV series. To see Picard the action hero, pop Nemesis into your trusty ol' DVD player. I can only hope that a true ending to this great TV series will eventually surface. Michael Piller, Ira Steven Behr and Ronald D. Moore, please come back!
0380788624|5.0|This is one of those books that takes a while to get fully immersed in as it has many, many characters and plots spun across the present and WWII.  However as  you read more and more of it, the various plots and characters become completely engrossing and you're all done.  Next thing you know, it's 3am and you have to force yourself to stop reading in order to be functional the next day.  And you've got half the book to go.  At least, that's the kind of the book it was for me.  It's the got the complex plot and intrigues of a Tom Clancy or Robert Ludlum book, only without the macho 'man against world' protagonists their works suffer from.
B00000099Y|1.0|Really looked forward to this given the rave reviews.  If you're a Tool fan u'll love it but if u r like me trying to listen to different things - well this is awesomely pretentious hard rock album circa Hawkwind / Uriah Heep from the 70s (who did it much better).  Excruciating longeurs abound, usual dark and superficial lyrics, songs seem interminable and never end, heaps of wallowing in their own misery.  Texture?  More like infinite boredom - even the vocalist seems bored.  Arguably one of the most over-rated bands and albums ever.  For 1st timers like myself, Lateralus is better for its variety, and differeing musical styles and variety.  Aenima is very predictable - within 30 seconds you know where the song is going but the problem is u have to wait for what seems like an eternity for it to finish. Soft beginning - big crunching chorus - musical interludes structure.  This just sounds like a mish-mash of instrumental confusion.  Great for 14 year old boys but really superficial and wantonly abrasive.  Buy with caution - remember most of the very positive reviews here are from Tool fans.  Most non-fans will be a litle more critical thankfully.

0385504209|3.0|I must say I was disappointed by this book.  I had heard such glowing reports about it ... especially about how suspenseful, riveting & insightful it was.  The book got off to a good start, but quickly became pretty transparent & (at times)didactic.  Brown keeps telling us how \\"amazing\\" and \\"startling\\" all these revelations are, when most of them have been telegraphed way ahead of time, leaving room for only one actual surprise (and it felt almost like a \\"cheap trick\\" -- won't elaborate coz I don't want to be a spoiler).  I give this book kudos as a very entertaining way to brush up on the history & lore of the Holy Grail, but its conclusions about the ultimate nature of the Grail fall sadly short of being startling, inspiring or convincing. There are far greater Mysteries associated with the Grail that could have been more daringly explored. Most annoying of all was Brown's attitude that he was enlightening the \\"great unwashed\\" on subjects which have been the focus of a great deal of exploration over the past 30 years (at least!): goddess worship, Nature religion, the perils of patriarchy & organized religion, and the history of the Knights Templar & the Priory of Sion. I was reminded of the hype that accompanied the publication of the Celestine Prophecy, everybody going \\"Wow!\\" about the obvious. Sigh!
B00008NG5V|5.0|This a great album. I thought Brushfire was good...it just gets better. You need to look beyond the catchy tunes. His political/enviromental views are right on. If you sing along with JJ sing it like you mean it.<br />Jack Johnson for President.<br />Now we just need a live album.

B00005JLR2|5.0|This is a great movie. The animated version of Treasure Island that takes place in space. This movie is about a 15 year old teen, Jim Hawkins. He is constantly getting into trouble with the police and if he does it one more time, he'll be sent to the juevnile hall. His father left his family when he was young and his mother is busy running the Benbow Inn. When a ship crashes a few feet away from the inn, an old alien stagers iut and gives Jim a mysterious map. The map leads to Treasure Planet, so Jim and his mother's friend, Dr. Doppler, hir a crew and a ship to take them to Treasure Planet. <br />I love the way the characters are drwan in the movie. The villain, Scroop (I didn't count Silver as a true villain) is so cool. The way his voice sounds in a hiss. he kind of reminds me of Scar. Scroop hates Jim and Mr. Arrow, who he kills when the Star Pellusa turns into a black hole, and the affection Silver has for Jim. Jim Hawkins is also a great character. He looks like a typical teen. <br />If you're looking for a great movie, get Treasure Planet!
1587990717|5.0|This book is an extended narrative on our inept ability to account for randomness.  First, we don't do a good job of attributing the correct proportion of random luck to skill in life's ups and downs. We assume our good fortune is skill and bad fortune is luck.  We don't split it down the middle, it is either luck or skill, not a blend. Taleb calls this probability blindness. Probability blindness is a term for our inability to maintain the existence of simultaneous realities.  The glass is about full or about empty.  It cannot be 'about full' and 'about empty' simultaneously.<br />Second, we forget the drop outs, and focus on the survivors.  Taleb calls this the 'Survivor bias'.  If you train a million monkeys to pound on a million typewriters for an infinite amount of time, one of them will write an exact duplicate of a Shakespeare sonnet. Still the 'surviving monkey' who produces a great sonnet has achieved this through pure luck..  The effort is entirely random. We are simply prone to attribute the 'one' monkey's success with skill, just because he was randomly chosen to have the winning lottery ticket.<br />In financial markets, a flim-flam stock broker uses the survivor bias to make big bucks.  He sends 5000 people a letter saying the market is going up, and 5000 a letter saying it will go down.  A month later, the 5000 recipients of the 'correct' letter, get a second letter.  Half get the up message, the other half get the down message. A month later, the 2500 recipients of the winning call get a third letter, 1250 up and 1250 down.  The 1250 who have now gotten 3 correct calls in a row, receive solicitations and 200 invest in the broker's offshore fund. The flim-flam man disappears with a million dollars.<br />Why do the 200 invest?  They forget that surviving the test does not imply skill.  They are fooled by randomness.<br />While interesting, this is not unfamiliar.  Taleb throws in a very useful twist, though.  He points out that knowing this doesn't insure  we do any better.  As Taleb puts it, 'my only advantage is my awareness of my frailty.'<br />The humility invoked here raises this book to an entirely more interesting level.  I was reminded of Thomas Merton's anti-biography, '7 Storied Mountain'. Like Merton, Taleb seems to spend more time contradicting himself and going on odd tangents.  For example, we are treated to a digression on honorable suicides and the sweet poetry people wrote to remember the practitioners.  In another section, we are advised to treat people as Martians because they become easier to ignore.  Like Merton, Taleb's style of delivery tells us more than the words alone can communicate, we must fumble through the paradoxes. This isn't a book on doing probability, its about developing humility.  There is no prescription for defeating our instincts, only advice for living with them.  In this, you find the best the book has to offer .<br />Taleb suggests he is tortured by probability.  It is not an 'interest,' it is an obsession. How refreshing an insight.  His drive doesn't come from 'reason', it comes from his emotional constitution. Not the sort of stuff you usually hear.ure  we do any better.

BUT HEY, NUMBER 20 IS IMPRESSIVE AND THEY WERE HIGHER THAN AEROSMITH WHICH SAYS ALOT.<BR>PIECE OF MIND IS BY FAR THEIR BEST ALBUM. I CAN SAY THIS BECAUSE IT STANDS THE TEST OF TIME...WHAT IS THE TEST OF TIME....ONE'S ABILITY TO THOROUGHLY ENJOY AN ALBUM 20 YEARS LATER. I WAS A HUGE FAN OF THIS BAND BUT LOST INTEREST AFTER ADRIAN SMITH LEFT. YES, SOMEWHERE IN TIME RANKS A CLOSE SECOND AND NUMBER OF THE BEAST THIRD, BUT THIS IS THE MAIDEN ALBUM TO HAVE IN ANY COLLECTION<BR>WHY...<BR>IT SOUNDS THE BEST, HAS THE BEST WRITING, TWO OF THEIR BEST EVER SONGS (THE TROOPER AND FLIGHT OF ICARUS), A NEW AND INCREDIBLE DRUMMER WHO CAN FLAT OUT PLAY AND WONDERFUL CHEMISTRY BETWEEN ALL BAND MEMBERS. I REALLY BELIEVE THIS ALBUM GOT IRON MAIDEN ON THE MAP AND ON THE WAY TO SUPERSTARDOM..WHY, AS SAID BEFORE, IT IS A GREAT ALBUM. <BR>LASTLY, IRON MAIDEN REALLY HAD SOME INCREDIBLE ALBUM COVERS THAT TOLD THE STORY OF EDDIE...THIS PARTICULAR COVER I FEEL WAS THE BEST. I REMEMBER LISTENING TO THIS ALBUM MANY TIMES AND SIMPLY STARING AT THE COVER..IT WAS FASCINATING YET HAUNTING IN SOME ODD WAY.<br />BUY THIS ALBUM AND ENJOY IT..YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED!!!
B00005JLWN|5.0|Director Kurt Wimmer - remember this name - has put together a thoughtful, dynamic and action-packed movie. Reviewers have already posted opinions about its strong and weak points, but I would like to add my name to the pile of \\"recommended\\" reviews. I thought it kicked [butt] on an intellectual, emotional, as well as physical level. <br />The action sequences are stunning, well-sequenced bits of eye candy challenging \\"The Matrix\\" for overall intensity and creativity. They only spent $20 million on this baby, yet my need for cinematic connection was strangely sated as the credits rolled up the screen. My thoughts at the time: wow.<br />I'm not claiming this is among the top sci-fi movies ever, but this sleeper packs a mighty punch. <br />Check it out. I highly recommend it.
B00005JKGK|4.0|A farewell party for a young Chinese-American woman who is about to leave for China to visit the sisters she has never met provides the backdrop for an anthology of intriguing stories told in flashback.  Three immigrant woman  from China (Tsai Chin, France Nuyen, Lisa Lu) recall the difficult journey from pre-Revolutionary China to their present comfortable San Francisco lifestyle, while their four daughters (Ming-Na Wen, Tamlyn Tomita, Rosalind Chao, Lauren Tom) remember how difficult it is to please their demanding mothers, who are still very much influenced by a culture that the daughters have never experienced.  It is the universal dilemma of the newly immigrated, this cultural disconnect between parents and children, but this film also touches upon family issues that anyone can recognize.  The complex story is made perfectly clear through a skilled screenplay (by Ronald Bass and Amy Tan, from her novel) and direction (by Wayne Wang).<br />One dark cloud: like so many stories about ethnic women, the men are portrayed almost exclusively in an unfavorable light.  Asian-American writer and scholar Frank Chin has accused Amy Tan of inventing legends and cultural practices that did not exist in China, but which reflect poorly on Chinese men and portray Chinese cultural as being more misogynistic than it really is.  Is he right?  I don't know.  If so, many of those fabrications are certainly repeated in the film, which would be unfortunate.  Nevertheless, I was moved by this story.
B000025XKM|5.0|Pink Moon was the first Nick Drake CD I purchased, after reading a ridiculous magazine article a few years ago that compared him to Cat Stevens(?!)  I may have set the bar a bit high for myself.  Drake's last album is probably also his least accessible, and the first few listens can be something of a shock to fans of a style and era in which songwriters usually wore their hearts on their sleeves.  There's as much raw emotion here as on any singer-songwriter album, but you have to go looking for it.  Nothing about this album is easy or straightforward, and it's easy to see why Drake's music was rarely heard on the radio then or now.  But that's why it's worth listening to again and again until it all clicks.<br />Although the album was recorded in just two days, it features a polished and rehearsed sound, as if Drake had been working on these selections for years to settle on just the right vocal and instrumental combinations.  Most of the songs feature only his guitar for accompaniment, but thanks to his intricate fingerpicking, the sound is oddly spare and full at once.  Reading the lyrics on the page is a bit like reading impressionist poetry, and listening to them in Drake's edge-of-death whisper hardly clarifies the picture much.  A few of the songs still have me wondering if there's any meaning to them, but they're nothing if not thought-provoking.  <br />And over three decades after their release, they haven't aged a day.  This is definitely one of those albums that require repeated listening; but like most such albums, it's a nice antidote to most of what's popular at any given moment.
B00008MNYS|5.0|I'm just discovering this pop/rock/soul/funk/sexgod... And I'm hooked.  Escapology is amazingly intuitive and a complete joy to listen to.  I cannot seem to take it off repeat.  Lyrically ripe with insight, anger, observation and love, this is a CD which could very well make it onto my all-time top 20. A couple of times through this CD and you can be sure that each and every one of those tattoos has a story.  (The May Advocate interview confirms...)  Not since Peter Gabriel's \\"So\\" has an album by a male vocalist grabbed my attention like this!
B00008S2VG|1.0|I've been a huge Madonna fan for 20 years, but unfortunately, must be honest in that this album is absolute trash.  This album is nothing more than moronic, childish and/or depressing lyrics accompanied by the most lackluster music of any Madonna album to date.  Using a vocoder for voice treatment and hopping on a rap/hip-hop bandwagon to seem \\"trendy\\" is a pathetic waste of Madonna's talent.  As for the repetitive lyrics - I don't ever want to hear another word about Madonna's mother - her story has been told repeatedly - let it go!  And really - are we to believe the Material Girl has found some sort of salvation?  From what?  Listening to her whine is utterly too much to bear.  Does Madonna seriously think any of us would believe her tripe with respect to experiencing such angst over her position in life?  Does she really think she's cutting edge by introducing us to Madonna rap?  What next - a Madonna gansta rap album?  A joint effort with Eminem?  I sensed something was amiss as a result of all the hype and publicity surrounding this LP, not to mention the inclusion of a previous \\"hit\\" (Die Another Day).  Bottom line - there was absolutely nothing on this album that would cause me to play it again - the entire feel of it is forced and lifeless - not to mention embarrassing to listen to.  The last time I felt this disappointed in a major artist's release was when Depeche Mode unleashed Exciter (about as lame as they come).  Negative review aside, I maintain hope Madonna will produce a brilliant album next time around.  Over a span of 20 years, one atrocious album is not a bad track record.  The Material Girl's only saving grace on this outing is that thus far, the remix CDs of \\"Die Another Day\\" and \\"American Life\\" are for the most part excellent (so long as you skip the rap/hip-hop mixes).  Madonna dear, you needn't lower yourself to the level of a moronic rap or hip-hop artist - just be yourself and you'll flourish.  If you've never bought a Madonna album before, definitely steer clear of this one.  Treat yourself instead to one of her truly wonderful and innovating albums such as \\"Ray of Light\\" or \\"Erotica.\\"  Those were both groundbreaking albums in many ways, and continue to hold up through time.
B00008J4P5|1.0|This CD is horrible. I found no redeeming quality to it on a musical vein. All of the great albums you can listen to over and over again and discover new things because there are subtle layers and textures there. Here there is none. You can't get very complicated with a guitar and simple four piece drum set. The simple poppy hooks might be fine for someone with no real musical taste but when you listen to as many new releases as I do it get's very old, very quick. I wouldn't be surprised if this record will be mocked some day in the future as the downfall of the pop culture of the 90's to bring in a new genre for the 00's.<br />All in all \\"The White Stripes\\" are terribly overrated and in my opinion do not live up to the hype, they collapse and burn under the pressure.
B00005ASOI|3.0|Let's give credit where credit is due.  Suspiria has beautiful colours, fantastic camera work, and a nice transfer. It ends there.  The basic plot and appalling acting let the film down.  As for the horror scenes - well, let's remember that it was made in 1977 and the horror scenes would have frightened audiences then - the R rating was fitting for the time.  Times have changed, and audiences expect more of horror films.<br />DVD SUMMARY:<BR>If you are like me, and heard so much about Suspiria, you will want to see it to satisfy your own curiosity.  Aside from the bad points regarding the acting and plot, I am pleased to tell you that Anchor Bay have delivered a STUNNING print of this movie on DVD.  It's so pristine that it's hard to believe it was filmed in 1977.  Everything about the print deserves 10 out of 10.  It should be reference for how to restore an old film.  I have the Single Disc edition DVD, which is probably the best version to buy if you haven't seen the film.  You still get the same version shown on the 3-disc, and some extras (but not the documentary), and also the DTS soundtrack.  <br />Suspiria is a difficult DVD movie to find to rent, so if you are interested in seeing it, just buy the single edition DVD (it's cheaper).  Despite the fact that I don't really love the movie, I am still glad to own it because of the camera work and colours - as well as the excellent DVD transfer.  Nothing can quite prepare you for the incredible restoration work that Anchor Bay have done.  Bravo Anchor Bay.
B0000931OG|5.0|What's going on here? All of a sudden there's plenty of good, deep music coming out. We probably won't hear any of it on the radio, but thank God the music exists.  My favorite track at the moment is \\"On The Way To The Club\\", but there's plenty of textural echoey guitars and percolating synths on a lot of the songs, and they all cradle Damon's voice so nicely. Other cds I've gotten recently ...include Coldplay, Travis, Pat Ortman's The Wow Signal, Peter Gabriel's Up, and Billy Corgin's new band.
B000088DTS|5.0|I realized the majority of you won't be clicking on this review because Delta will probably not recieve that much publicity in America, even though she is already hugely famous in Australia and making waves in the UK. Lots of people are comparing her to former soapie-stars-turned-singers Kylie Minouge and Holly Valance. However, I think Delta Goodrem's style is more similar to Danielle Spencer, another unknown Ozzie in America. They both play the piano and do not go techno like Kylie or Holly. Delta wrote, or co-wrote almost all the songs on this album and she seems to have a gift! Please, any Americans or whoever you are who find this review PLEASE give Delta a chance. You don't havta buy the album, just download some of her songs..she really does have a good voice and good music. You won't regret it.
B00005JKPF|4.0|I am going to forgo the typical \\"sum up the plot\\" review that most people seem to favor writing and instead focus on what makes this movie work.  As with the original, it is the seriousness and the gravity with which Bryan Singer approaches his subject matter that continues to keep the X-Men movie franchise from sinking to the depths of such awful comic book movie sequels as BATMAN III & IV and SUPERMAN III & IV.  At their best, comic books are dealing with real life issues and problems under the guise of fantasy.  That is what has made the first two X-Men movies so good, they are a perfect blend of fantasy injected into a \\"real world\\" setting.<br />This movie has a more somber tone than its predecessor, and one finds it harder to pity the humans in this movie, as we see their ingnorance and intolerance (as well as own reflected back at us) on full display.  As far as action, the sequel far outdoes the original, and watching each mutant display his/her powers more breathtaking.  My only concern is that the movie does not really stand on its own, and screams out for a third installment to complete the story.  That may not be such a bad thing, as long as Singer and the excellent cast returns, and the storytelling continues to be as impressively executed.
0375758992|4.0|Written as a series of stream-of-concsiousness stand-alone essays, but organized in a linear fashion, covering the period of time from the author's birth, through her marriage.  I live in Africa, which makes me appreciate the author's descriptions even more.  I have traveled extensively in both southern and central Africa, although I've never been to the locations described in the book.  Her descriptions are extremely vivid-after reading this book, I feel that I've been to these places, and experienced her life with her.    Nevertheless, I found her young life shocking in many ways.  The book also helped me understand the current political climate of Zimbabwe today, and the origin of why the blacks are dispossing the white farmers today.  A very good book.
B00008PW3Q|5.0|I have to say I wasn't overly optimistic about this release, but am ecstatic to be proven wrong. Musicians will love this record as it has all the bases covered great musicianship, great songs, great variety, catchy, below-the-radar twists .Mick and John are superb and the epitomy of the perfect rhythm section.<br />There are at least 10 great songs here, that get better with every listen.The best song is \\"'Destiny Rules\\" . Stevie and Lindsey combine to make this a CLASSIC.Great guitar playing , outstanding lyrics and the \\"x\\" factor. <br />Buckingham is truly at his creative peak on this record, so much so I wonder if he's gone over the edge of sanity.His compositions are all great here from \\"Murrow\\" to \\"Red Rover\\" to the over-the-top but brilliant \\"Come\\" This is like the Beatles meets punk meets something else.. ? What a song. \\"Miranda\\" is a bit of a throwback song with great layers and exceptional slide guitar.<BR>\\"Peacekeeper\\" is just a classic song with Stevie doing some hair-raising harmonies. \\"Steal your heart away\\" is a great pop-folk-country song with superb production.\\"Everybody finds out\\" is the second best Nick's song with an upbeat, but heavy dance feel.\\"Say goodbye\\" is heart wrenching and beatiful. Some of the other Nick's songs haven't really grown on me yet , but even if they don't this one is a classic ! Time will tell , but I predict a grammy and \\"classic\\" staus once people buy it and give it a few spins. <br />The only complaint is they could have made a 10 song record and have surpassed \\"Rumours\\", but the 10 great songs are there.Based on other reviews here many of the songs I don't care for are other's favorites ...This record will make you feel , which is what art is all about . Two words .. Get it...

B00005JKN9|5.0|I saw this movie the day before it was released with a bunch of theater workers at an advanced screening.  It was my most anticipated movie of 2002, and I was not disappointed.  The film was magnificent.  Martin Scorsese is a true artist, he knows how to make movies, and he knows how to entertain the audience.  <br />The story is familiar, but told beautifully.  Leonardo DiCaprio, Cameron Diaz, Jim Broadbent, everyone was good, but the real star of the picture is Daniel Day-Lewis.  Playing Bill the Butcher, Daniel Day-Lewis is miraculous, his performance is one of the best I have ever seen.  This man is one of the best actors of our time, and this is quite possibly his best performance.  Though he seems Bill seems like villain, he loves his country.<br />The set is brilliantly made, I was in awe by how real everything was.  The costumes were top notch, and the score was hauntingly beautiful.  U2's song \\"The Hands That Built America\\" fit perfectly with the film, and it's a great song.<br />I'm very disappointed that Gangs of New York didn't win any Academy Awards, but that doesn't take away the greatness of the film.  I believe Scorsese deserved the Oscar.  I believe Daniel Day-Lewis deserved the Oscar.  I believe U2 deserved the Oscar.  But though it went away Oscarless, Scorsese should be proud.  He made a remarkable film that will be remembered.  Just like Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, GoodFellas, and his other films, Gangs of New York will stand the test of time and will be known as one of the legendary directors gerat achievements.
0743457900|3.0|Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy, by John Le Carré was a very weird and confusing spy novel to read. At points, the story would get so involved in minor details that I would get lost in it. Still, the story demonstrates a spy mystery by having a mole in the spectrum of it all. <br /> This book focuses on George Smiley, a fired former spy of the British network, known as the Circus. Now divorced from his wife Anne, Smiley is brought back into the game to find the spy, the mole, in the current Circus network since he was once the best. All the secrets of the British intelligence are being given to the Russian enemy, Karla, and he is determined to find the one person in this deceitful game. <br /> After Control, the head of the Circus dies early in the book, Smiley continuously searches for the mole. It is Control who suspects in the first place there is a leak in the intelligence, and near the end of the book, Smiley unmasks the culprit, through a different list of people. Among the suspects are the four top heads of the British network by the last names of Alleline, Haydon, Biland, and Esterhase. <br />Through the story, clues are given to who the traitor is in the Circus. Several people are asked questions such as the Russian, Tarr. He holds a diary from his old girlfriend, Irina, which shows some of the different Russian dealings, which are helpful to solving the mystery. Other people interviewed are the absent minded old lady Connie, and the former prisoner Jim Predux. <br /> Overall, this book was pretty hard to read because it was focused on the settings and minor details that weren't important to the story, so it took longer to get through. Such details as these were how the houses looked, and what food tasted like, which aren't relevant to the story. It did convey a good spy novel though in the sense that clues were given and the reader has to figure out who the mole is in the intelligence. If you like spy mystery novels, you will enjoy this novel.
B000083E79|5.0|This CD truly shows the staying power and talent of Cher.  From songs that my mother listened to, to the ones I danced to as a teenager, this album has it all.

B00005JLXE|5.0|Good.  Fun.  Low on campiness.<br />The film is true to the spirit of the comic, and interpreted very well to suit live-action.  The effects are cool and convey the hero's world well.  It's a good choice if you like action movies with a bit of humor.<br />Some have complained that it is too dark.  What do you expect from a movie about a blind vigilante working in Hell's Kitchen and motivated by vengeance?  It is a little dark...and amen.<br />If there is a weak point, it would probably be in the performances.  Although all of the characters are portrayed fairly well there was room for improvement for each of the actors in the film.  It seemed fairly obvious that Ben Affleck was a tad uncomfortable with an action role, and Jennifer Garner's action/drama boundaries weren't really pushed--after all she does action scenes weekly.  Colin Ferrell played his character a little over the top, but he wasn't really given enough screen-time to properly develop his character, so... <br />If you like comic/action movies you might get a real kick out of Daredevil.  If you want absolute realism and high-drama, buy the Pianist.
B00008S2VG|5.0|This is by far Madonna's best album.  The production is fresh and flawless. And her voice is pure and beautiful.  Every single song on here is as solid as a rock.  I don't see how anybody can say it's not her best work.  She has never sounded better and the production is totally next level.  She's always ahead of the game and soon people will realize this album is too.

As I listen to each song I notice that they all resemble each other, with an exception to \\"Immortal\\" and \\"Bring me back\\". This can quickly get annoying. I presonally think the best song on this album is the radio hit \\"Bring me back\\". It's very powerful and spine tingling. The song I hate the most is \\"Immortal\\". This song sounds like it was specifically written to kill yourself to. .... <BR>       I dont know, it just didnt grow on me.

0679735909|4.0|If you're looking for checkout-rack romance as a little light diversion, keep looking--\\"Possession\\" is not that book! This is a \\"heavy-weight\\" romantic tale, with thick literary allusions froms start to finish. From the punning character names to the classical references studded in its long Victorian poems, \\"Possession\\" will require your close attention.<br /><br /> Although the book introduces us to two sets of lovers, one modern and one Victorian couple, the tone throughout is Victorian. Even as the current couple deals with their commitment-phobia and their \\"post-Romantic\\" frame of reference,<br />their own story becomes caught up in the passions and constraints of the Victorian lovers.<br /><br /> Christabel LaMotte is determined to have her own life and to practice her literary art, yet she encounters a dragon in the person of Randolph Ash. Her love for him ambushes her, and its consequences undermine her lofty pursuits. Yet years later she tells him, \\"If there had to be a dragon, I'm glad it was you.\\"<br /> Slogging through the ornately written poems and the dense prose of the letters Christabel and Ash exchanged may make you feel you are in a classroom again, not reading for pleasure. But if you stay with this book, you will find a literary feast, satisfying and savory. Highly recommended.
B000001FS3|4.0|This album isn't great but isn't terrible either. It gives you an enjoyable listening experience overall, but unless you blast it at high volumes it gets pretty boring. Some songs are indeed classic and are just great with even lesser-known tracks like Running to Stand Still, One Tree Hill and Mothers of the Disappeared shining bright, but honestly this is in dire need of some serious remastering. My other 80s U2 album 'The Unforgettable Fire', also only sounds great at high volumes, but at lower ones it just doesn't quite have the emotional impact that it should. I even own some cassettes that sound better than these two. My only other U2 album All That You Can't Leave Behind sounds fantastic and is a very good album overall too, but sadly this one and my other one are also very good with just horrible sound quality. All CDs made before last year should be digitally remastered and all future ones should be as well. I just wish U2 would digitally remaster its massive catalog to make all of their albums sound superb. Maybe then I will think about buying some more U2, but for now I doubt if I will. Bummer, isn't it?

B000063DI9|5.0|This was my first Maiden CD , and it blew my head off.Really.From begining to end,this album must be among the Top 10 metal albums.A lot of Progresive elements,very dark lyrics,Dickinson's voice better than ever, the guitars work exelent and the rythym section Drums&Bass outstanding.There are no bad songs in here,maybe \\"The evil that men do\\"is kinda cheesy but the rest is so great.There are some songs like Moonchild,Infinite Dreams,Seventh Son...,The profecy that will stay in your mind forever once you hear them and i'm sure you'll keep coming back for more.what else could i say,maybe the best Metal Album ever.Great Piece of work by maiden.too bad they don't play too many of these songs live.but trust me buy this one,you wont regret it.
B000002UDB|5.0|SGT PEPPER was the Beatles' grand technical breakthrough -- so whatever followed was likely to pale by comparision -- at least at the time.  And MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR wasn't really an album at all -- it was a US collection of singles, added to a double-EP cobbled together by the Beatles to accompany their loopy technicolour TV extravaganzoid released during the Christmas 1967 holiday (laughingly shown in black and white on the BBC!!!).  So it's often described as a sort of second-rate filler in the Beatles Collection.  Hogwash!  This album contains two of the very best Beatles' songs ever -- and both John Lennon classics!   \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\" reveals his struggle to find his place in the world -- and the fact producer George Martin was able to edit together two completely different arrangements of the song because John couldn't choose just one gave us an incredible recording full of richness and exotic sound.  \\"I Am The Walrus\\" has so much going on in it that you can listen to it again and again and hear something you didn't notice before.  John's ominous electric piano and tremendous vocal captivate from the beginning -- and the slurpy cellos and swooping cackles from the assembled gargoyles in the back rows (\\"hohoho hehehe hahaha\\") are the perfect accompaniment to this most bizarre of Beatles songs, just as the snatches of radio static and \\"King Lear\\" in the fadeout are a stroke of genius.  I love comparing it with the stripped down version on ANTHOLOGY 2.  There are other terrific songs here too.  John's \\"All You Need Is Love\\" is a bit dated, but it's still a wonderful piece of music.  Paul McCartney has a couple of great moments too.  \\"Penny Lane\\" may be one of his finest creations;  a shiny, bouncy look at suburban Liverpool that makes you wish you lived there.  And the \\"Fool On The Hill\\" is such a beautifully crafted song you can even forgive the childish sounding recorder in the bridge.  In fact, it enhances the song by giving it an innocence that fits with the picture of the man with the foolish grin.  As for the rest, \\"Hello Goodbye\\", George's \\"Blue Jay Way\\" and the title track are all enjoyable, though not at the top of the Beatle catalogue.    Overall, while this album doesn't rate quite as highly as REVOLVER, ABBEY ROAD or \\"the White Album\\", it's still a wonderful CD, and a must for any Beatles' collection.
B00008PW3O|5.0|There are only two albums I've been looking forward to this year, Fleetwood Mac's and later this year, Deep Purple's. The industry buzz on both of these records is...great stuff.<BR>Well, Fleetwood Mac's &quot;Say You Will&quot; is indeed a great album so this reassures me about Deep Purple in August. <BR>Now back to Mac's &quot;Say You Will&quot;. I liked all the songs on first listen. <BR>I didn't mind the production at all. In fact I loved it! Thanks Lindsey.<BR>I loved all the songs by the second and third listens. <BR>I also appreciate that the CD is 76+ minutes. <BR>I don't know about you, but I get stuck in a lot of traffic jams. Hey, if you don't like all the songs, just burn a disc of your favorites and play producer.<BR>One last note. To be honest I never have been a huge Stevie Nicks fan, but after hearing her songs, I was very impressed and even a bit...turned on, you might say. <BR>With so many &quot;light weight&quot; female vocalists out there, I guess I've forgotten what a &quot;real&quot; woman sounded like coming through my speakers. <BR>That's one down and one to go!
B000069AUI|5.0|Coldplay has done it again... Coldplay brings the piano & rock together like no one else. Green Eyes and the title track are my favs. Buy this album - you will not regret it.
B000002BQK|5.0|...After listening to her album Butterfly, Mariah gives me another new layer of impression. She is great and I will say that Butterfly is her best album till today (from her debut till Charmbracelet), the most personal, the most consistent and the finest performed album to date. Many people say that she starts to use her whispery and breathy vocal in this album, especially in the title track. Well, I have something to say, actually she starts it in her Daydream album, listen carefully. Her whispery and breathy vocal actually should be given credit as it makes the songs like The Roof, The Beautiful One, Breakdown, Yours (Charmbracelet), Bliss (Rainbow) & Underneath The Star (Daydream) so smooth and beautiful. To that extent, those songs will be better sung in breathy and whispery vocal then her powerful trademark vocal. This album is full of R & B + Pop + a little Hip-Hop flavors. Through this album, it is obvious that Mariah Carey has grown up a lot if compare to her Daydream, lyrically and musically.<br />1)Babydoll- very nice R & B song with nice and cool beat. <br />2) Breakdown- very soothing R & B flavor song with the <BR>              collaboration from Bone Thug N Harmonie. The <BR>              typical melancholy tune turns into a cool beat<BR>              song. A new try from Mariah. One of her <BR>              remarkable R & B song.<br />3) Butterfly- her best ballad ever produced with some R & B + <BR>              Pop flavors.It starts with her breathy and <BR>              whispery vocal and then her voice soars in this <BR>              song with emotions and the sadness feeling of <BR>              saying goodbye. I find that her whispery and <BR>              breathy vocal makes the song so beautiful, at <BR>              least she is trying to control her volume so that <BR>              it is not overused. No doubt this is the best <BR>              track in the whole album.The lyric and the melody <BR>              is definitely worth A+ grade.<br />4) Close My Eyes- nice R & B song and again her breathy and <BR>                  whispery voice works in this song.<br />5) Fly Away (Butterfly Reprise)- an uptempo song with some club <BR>                                 dance flavor in it.<br />6) Forth Of July- a nice and relaxing track which reminds us <BR>                  Underneath The Star.However, UTS is still <BR>                  better than FOJ. Once again,her breathy vocal<BR>                  works.<br />7) Honey- a nice R & B dance track with some club influence in <BR>          it.<br />8) Honey (Def Club Mix)- a very nice dance remix track. It is <BR>                         better than the original version. <br />9) Honey (So So Def Radio Mix)- a very nice remix with <BR>                                some \\"street\\" hip-hop flavor<BR>                                in it with some guest stars.It <BR>                                has some similarities with <BR>                                \\"I'm Real\\"(Murder Mix) <BR>                                featuring Ja Rule, but this is <BR>                                definitely better than that,  <BR>                                the beat is cool.<br />10) My All- nice track with Latin influence in it. It is <BR>            definitely one of her classical trademark <BR>            track.However, it is overplayed and people get <BR>            bored with it.<br />11) Outside- a nice R & B ballad that is really touching. It is <BR>             beautifully sung with her breathy vocal and the <BR>             lyric is also a great job of hers.<br />12) The Beautiful One- when I first hear it,I don't like it but <BR>                       slowly it grows inside me. It is a <BR>                       wonderful remake track which is <BR>                       totally different from the  original <BR>                       version. Her whispery vocal makes this  <BR>                       song so soothing.Mariah always uses <BR>piano as the background instrument for <BR>                       most of her songs,but this is a new try <BR>                       for her as the ending of the track <BR>                       uses electric guitar as background <BR>                       instrument.<br />13) The Roof- a good dance track with R & B influence in it. It <BR>              is a new try for Mariah in her songs, it has the <BR>              cool beat.<br />14) Whenever You Call- it is a very beautiful track after the <BR>                       title track,Butterfly.However, I still <BR>                       prefer the duet version which she sings <BR>                       duet with Brian McKnight where we can <BR>                       get it in her #1 album. With Brian's <BR>                       voice in that song,it makes the song <BR>                       more beautiful.<br />Overall, this is her album that should be owned by all the Mariah Carey's fans. Though, some of you may think that she should not go into this kind of music but I would say that this new style suits Mariah (excludes some of the filler and uninspired tracks that are contained in Rainbow, Glitter or Charmbracelet).
1559408898|3.0|I remember hearing about this when I was younger. A movie called Robocop was released in 1987 in theaters when I was only 7 at the time so I didn't see it till I was 10 when it was on video. This movie does have a unique and original concept about a police offer being murdered and then coming back in machine form,which seperates the movie from a lot of sci-fi/action flicks at the time. Peter Weller does a good job as Murphy and as Robocop and Clarence's character played by the father from that 70's show(i don't know the actors name)does a good job convincing the audience he is a real evil guy. The movie however does have several annoying things apparent. One the corny effects done for ED 209 were even terrible in the 1987 era and the fight sequence between Robocop and ED 209 looks horrid(major claymation element to it)and secondly the guy who plays Dick Jones is really annoying and not that great in the movie. Lastly the most annoying and lame character that I was actually rooting for to get killed is the nerdy coke sniffing new OCP vice president who really was pathetic in the film. Also if you think you are getting a lot by buying this CRITERION your wrong,like other reviewers said you basically just get a few seconds more of Murphy's death scene and the scene where ED 209 flips out in the office(which is a lame scene anyways) and your better buying the regular version for 12.99 in the bargain bin at your local Target or Best Buy. BOTTOM LINE DECENT MOVIE,WORTH A RENTAL AT LEAST BUT IF YOU'VE SEEN ONCE ITS NOT A MOVIE I EVER WANT TO SEE AGAIN
0385504209|3.0|I started reading this book and was immediately fascinated by the historical content and the fast paced plot.  However, after reading further, I think the message that Mr. Brown was trying to get across to his readers is clear.  If you're an intelligent, scientific individual, you're a \\"good guy\\".  If you're a Christian, you're either stupid, mislead or evil.  I don't consider myself to be a fundamental Christian, and I'm still insulted by this book.  This poor, mislead Christian will have to find another book because I'm done with this one.

B00001OH7O|5.0|Well, first off, It's Bowie! How could it not be awesome? But<BR>this cd was truly one of his best. I love Kooks and Oh! you pretty things! Also a hint for anyone out there just getting into Bowie...Labyrinth! Tights! *takes deep breath* Go for it!<br />*Now ladies, your both so unutterably beautiful, why don't we do the sophisticated thing and all sleep together! (He sounds so innocent doesn't he?

6305291446|2.0|Where do I begin with this one? First of all, I think it's great that they bring back Laurie Strode, and the beginning scene is the only part of the movie that somewhat resembles any of the other &quot;Halloween&quot; movies. <br />One of the key factors in the previous movies in the series was the fact that they were in Haddonfield...that was where Michael's rage began.....While the setting is still scary, a boarding school in Cali just doesn't give it the same spooky feel, and I just felt like I was watching an episode of Dawson's Creek (besides the fact that Michelle Williams was in the movie).....Also, the mask looks completely different, you're not supposed to be able to see his eyes, and the hair is all messed up....And the worst part, as a fan of the series, is that it completely ignores the story line from parts 4-6...just because the director doesn't like those films doesn't mean they don't exist.....<br />I'm completely for the empowered woman who finally faces her demons, or in this case her psycho killer brother, but as a fan of the series, this ranks right near the bottom of the heap....if you like the &quot;Halloween&quot; movies, get it just to say you have it, but in my opinion it's one of the worst in the series....
630469797X|5.0|This movie is one of the best zombie movies ever! George Romero's vision is finally realized in this movie, which is in color unlike it's predecessor. This film is much more gorier just because it's in color. Tom Savini is a makeup genius in every way. I also liked the plot to the film, in which the walking dead is starting to multply into the thousands( which is what happens in the next installment). Four survivors escape Philadelphia and end up on top of a deserted shopping mall. They use it to their full advantage, gathering any kind of supplies they need. They end up staying there for months after taking care of the zombies inside the mall. But when a group of looters break into their somewhat perfect environment,all hell breaks loose! Definitely the best installment in George Romeo's trilogy! I highly recommend it to anyone who's interested in hooror films.5 stars!...
B00005JLEU|5.0|When I first got this movie I thought that it was going to be some kiddy movie (as it is a cartoon) but after watching this movie my opinion had been completly changed. This is one of my all-time favourites if not THE all-time favourite. The story to Spirited Away is the most original idea for a movie that I have ever seen, nothing can even begin to compare with it. The movie is about a girl named Chihiro who, with her mother and father are moving to a new home. they get lost along the way and discover an abandoned theme park. While Chihiro's parents eat the food at an abandoned restaurant Chihiro discovers a bath-house. When she returns to her parents they have been turned into pigs! So if Chihiro ever wants to see her parents in their normal state again she must get a job at the spirits bath-house. A place where spirits come to relax... If you're considering getting this movie I strongly suggest that you do.
B0000931OG|4.0|Everyone is making more out of the loss of Graham Coxen than I think is needed. A much bigger loss would be Damon. His voice has always been the most under-rated piece of Blur (that and Dave's Drumming) Think Tank is that transitional record with no direcetion, or should I say a few too many directions? The really great standout themes and tunes on this much anticipated disc have somewhat been undercut by the Coxen news and the obvious Fatboy Slim touches. (Crazy Beat) The different production styles, and experimentation kinda hurt an almost great record in the end.<br />Don't get me wrong though - I like this record a great deal. (even more after hearing the new stuff live) There are some INCREDIBLE songs on here... and some filler [], and the mandatory \\"push it as a single in Amercia\\" tune. <br />On the incredible side of things we have \\"Sweet Song.\\" An amazing heartfelt \\"sweet\\" song that tugs on the heart strings and glides along effortlessly. There is also the incredible and incredibly short, \\"We've Got A File On You,\\" which shows a bit of rockin' mayhem via London punk style. I also really dig the first UK single, \\"Out Of Time\\" and the weird angst electro-rock of, \\"The Moroccan People's Revolutionary Bowls Club.\\" There are shades of classic Parklife era Blur, on tunes like \\"Gene By Gene\\" and \\"Battery in Your Leg\\" (the only Coxen number of the lot) <BR>All of those tunes add up to a nice mix with quite a powerful punch.<br />But there are also some really low points too. The radio pushed \\"Crazy Beat\\" has become rather bothersome after a few weeks in. The stupid Gollum-like voice over on it is really annoying as well. Couple that with a guitar riff lifted right from Song 2, and you get the idea. Some of the experiments go a little haywire as well. \\"Jets\\" becomes very throw-away and \\"Ambulance\\" serves no other purpose but that of being the record's low key opener.<br />The rest of the record is a mish mash of half-baked but well produced tunes that give that all over feel that a rushed record tends to have. This was no rushed record though. Maybe just a little, over-thought.<br />THINK TANK'S song by song C-Dub-Ya break-down:<BR>1. Ambulance - soft non-threatening opener, a good tune actually - 7.0<BR>2. Out of Time - now we're talking - a great Blur single - 8.5<BR>3. Crazy Beat - catchy at first - but soon an annoying Song 2 - 6.0<BR>4. Good Song - actually an OK song, not too good, not too bad - 7.0<BR>5. On the Way To The Club - should've been a great b-side - 6.5<BR>6. Brothers and Sisters - a bit like Tender, just not as good - 6.5<BR>7. Caravan - a little forgettable, but not terrible - 6.0<BR>8. We've Got A File On You - awesome, too short though - 8.5<BR>9. Moroccan Peoples Revolutionary Bowls Club - cool & strange - 7.5<BR>10. Sweet Song - best thing on the album, a beauty - 9.0<BR>11. Jets - mostly electronic filler - 6.0<BR>12. Gene By Gene - a quirky, Blur like song, good stuff - 7.5<BR>13. Battery in Your Leg - another high mark for departed Graham - 8.0

Morrie faces the fact of his own death with a rare courage . The young man, Mitch, learns from Morrie a sense of human mortality. The book is written with a profound wisdom and insight. The story is deeply moving. Albom's writes with a great clarity about his mentor and good friend. I enjoyed the book very much. Anyone having lost a dear one should read this book. There's a great lessen to be learned here.
B000002L7Y|4.0|This particular CD has a great climate, it takes you back in time to relive special events that happened back then... For one song especially, I would buy the whole cd &quot;Living the boy's adventure tale&quot; this is one of the best songs I EVER heard. Anyway, the whole cd is an art, so sit back and let it take you to &quot;remember when.&quot;

My fav. song is unravel, it really shows that bjork can sing dispite how some people feel. She really is an amazing person. Many people call her strange but is she really? Because she dooesnt do what everyone else does doesnt make her strange. If people would really open there eyes then they would see the amazing talent she has!!!

If you have not read Sabriel it is better to read it before Lirael. Lirael is about a girl called Lirael who is a clayr and has lived all her life on a mountain. But she is different from the rest of the clayr and looks it. Soon she is made to leave and there starts her journey fighting evil and the dead and finding her father.
B00005UWBP|5.0|I found this movie to be very informative in displaying a dinosaur's true anger towards the human race for making them extinct.
B000002LGQ|5.0|This album has been without a doubt the highlight of Madonna's 20 year career. It has a light-hearted, fun pop sound to it, yet the album has insight and is very personal at the same time. Combining these elements makes a truly great album. I truly think that \\"Like A Prayer\\" was the album that solidified Madonna as a superstar and showed the world that she'd be around for years to come. Of course, she was already a huge star coming off of three massively successful albums and numerous top 10 hits but before this album, I'm sure the critics were still predicting her demise.<br />The album begins with the #1 title track which is one of my favorite Madonna songs. Everyone has heard it. \\"Express Yourself\\" hit #2 on the charts and is a great dance track and I loved the video. She also had top 10 hits with the fun pop ditty \\"Cherish\\" *another of my faves* and the family anthem \\"Keep It Together.\\" \\"Oh Father\\" was a top 20 hit and one of Madonna's best songs to this day. It's a heart-breaking ballad about her relationship with her father as a child. \\"Dear Jessie\\" is a bouncy pop song showing off Madonna's soft side or even \\"maternal\\" side if you would. \\"Promise to Try\\" is another great ballad in the tradition of \\"Oh Father.\\" I also enjoy \\"Till Death Do Us Part\\" although it's a more serious track disguised by a great pop sound. <br />Even if you have the \\"Immaculate Collection\\" *like I did* I still recommend this album. Not only do you get the superior album versions of the singles that were included, you also get \\"Oh Father\\" and \\"Keep It Together\\" which were not included. And the filler on this album is just as good as the singles. Don't pass this one up.

B000092Q4U|5.0|If you are looking for a total balls to the wall assault of true metal then you have come to the right place with Lamb of God's &quot;As the Palaces Burn&quot;. Lamb of God have stayed just as heavy and brutal as they were on &quot;New American Gospel&quot; but the music is slightly more technical with some 80's thrash elements thrown in. The vocalist is just as brutal as ever throwing out some of the sickest growls and screams that can challenge any metal vocalist out there. The drummer is as incredible as ever, with some incredible double bass drums and blast beats. Everye song on this CD is amazing, but the best songs are &quot;11th Hour&quot;, &quot;For Your Malice&quot;, and &quot;Vigil&quot;

B00005JKPF|5.0|\\"X2\\" is a better movie than it's predecessor in all the ways that \\"T2\\" was to its. It has a plot that is fresh and interesting, groundbreaking special effects and action scenes, and great acting and directing.<br />Plotwise, the film is slightly lacking. I stress the word slightly. It's nothing you'll notice in the movie, but were you to summarize the plot for your friends, it might sound a little trite. And maybe it is, but it's not noticeable thanks to the acting.<br />But we fans won't care about any of this. The beauty of having read 20-plus years of continuity allows us to bridge gaps and make assumptions involuntarily. We already HAVE a director's cut in our heads. What you really want to know about is the acting and the effects. And here they are:<br />Wolverine: If you had any doubts about Hugh being perfect, this will throw them to the floor and tromp them. One of my complaints with the first film was that Wolvie was kinda weak. He got trashed by Mystique (granted, an butt-kicking Mystique who is better than her comic counter part) and Sabretooth. Here though, Wolvie gets to go berserk. Mmmm... berserk. The whole mansion scene is a fan-service and oh what joy does it elicit. Logan kills, maim, and generally destroys. He's the best there is at what he does. But what he does isn't very pretty.<br />Nightcrawler: Oh. My. God. Alan \\"I am Een-veenceebahl!\\" Cummings IS Kurt Wanger. His accent is dead on. His face is all but perfect. The only problem I had with his appearance was that there wasn't enough shadowplay ... it was TOO blue. But during the night scenes... it's an Alex Ross painting come to life. And they got his teleporting right! Remember the Claremont runs when Kurt would take down a group of foes by teleporting behind them and flooring them in succession? He DOES that! No mention made of his BAMF! stench though.<br />Jean: I don't want to give anything away, but this isn't the Jean from the first movie. Oh, it's still Famke Janssen, but when she usedCerebro, it changed her. And I think you can guess how. I didn't care for her much in the first film, but now... god, you can why Logan loves her.<br />Cyclops: James Marsden needs to die. Remember the old Cyclops? The dorky-but-cool, I-can-take-down-the-entire-team-by-myself Scott? What happened to him? I don't like comic Cyclops as a person, but I always though he was kinda cool. Movie-Cyclops is just a dork. It's a wonder why Wolverine just doesn't break him. I can't believe this weenie is playing Jesse Custer... they'd better cast Cass better.<br />Storm: Halle Berry is okay, but Storm just doesn't do much. When you consider that she was usually the second or third main character in the comic stories and you give her a minor role in the movie... it's not going to cut it. I won't miss Halle is she doesn't return for the sequel though.<br />Stryker: Why don't we see more of Brian Cox? He's been in, I think, four of my favorite movies these past few years. He's a great actor and his Stryker is cold, but there's a hint of pain beneath it all.<br />Deathstrike: Never mentioned by her alias in the film. God, she's beautiful. Unfortunately, she's the red-shirted-crewman of the film ... the only reason she's there is to throw down with Wolverine. And she does. And it's cool. Too bad she only had a single line of dialogue. <br />Mystique: Didn't care for her much in the first film. Then, she was just Generic Half-naked Henchwoman. In \\"X2\\" we see her devotion to Magneto. I love her scenes as Senator Kelly too (Bruce Davidson did a great job playing Mystique-as-Kelly). She's definitely become a central character and much thanks to Rebecca Stamos for enduring all that make-up. And she can actually act! They didn't really let her in the first, but she's darn good here. <br />Magneto and Professor X: They're played by Ian McKellan and Patrick Stewart. If these guys ever make a mistake, I'll let you know.<br />Now then, cameos, cameos, cameos. Colossus is there and his part is great (pretty funny too) and when he metals up ... awe inspiring. Too bad it was so short. Syren (or is it Siren? Theresa Cassidy, anyhow) is there, same with Kitty \\"Katya\\" Pryde and we see the girls use their powers. Worst-Mutant-Ever Artie has a few seconds of screen time (thankfully he's not annoying). You'll catch a glimpse of human Hank McCoy, a soundbyte of Sebastion Shaw (which nixes the argument that Stryker's kid was Mastermind), and a few names on Stryker's computer. In addition, one of the folders on Stryker's desktop is marked \\"Project Wideawake\\" ... Sentinels anyone?! Maybe in X3. My favorite cameo was the RonCo guy, Ron Popeil when that little kid is watching TV.<br />The ending of the movie is very well done. There will of course be an X3 which leaves the question of its plot. The movie seems to hint towards Dark Phoenix which would be awesome were it done right. Personally, I would love to see Proteus. Maybe if they did that Cyclops-beating-down-Wolverine-and-Nightcrawler scenario I might respect James Marsden more... nah, probably not. Sentinels are always a possibility (as mentioned with the Project Wideawake folder). In any case, if Hugh, Brian, Famke, and Alan return we'll have a surefire hit.<br />In short: See this movie. See it twice. Quit your job and live at the theatre if you must. Because this movie is probably the best comic adaptation to screen. Maybe not the best movie, but certainly the best translation. Seen it twice already and I'll probably see it several more times ... and I don't usually do that. Last movies I can recall were \\"Harry Potter\\" and \\"The Matrix\\". Until \\"Watchmen\\" or \\"Preacher\\" hits the screen, the \\"X-Men\\" will have no trouble holding their title against the other comic-movie contenders.
B0000029DD|5.0|this is possibly my favorite albums of all times. i bought this when it came out, i was obsessed with it for months, it was all i listened to. sadly we lost jeff buckley but, what a wonderful gift to leave behind. this is an extremely emotional rollercoaster of an album. it reaches in so deeply to your heart. it is an absolute MUST HAVE. get it!!!
B00006M183|4.0|Since Ten, Pearl jam have never even tried to make a timeless, anthemic album of big rock cliches. Instead they have taken an alternative approach and explored many musical directions. This is a typical PJ album of wonderful highlights( 'I am mine', 'Love boat Captain', 'save you') and fresh new ventures('Bushleauger', 'help help').<BR>                             Compared to 20oo's binaural, this album  is slightly toned down and less complex so unfortunatly Mike McCready's guitar exploits are less common. Simple acoustic numbers like Thumbing my way and all or none show signs that PJ are a band becoming more and more controlled by frontman Eddie Vedder, in fact the once great songwriter Stone Gossard near absenteeism from the songwriting duties ensures Pearl Jam are no longer a 'Heavy' rock band. Eddie's vocals are louder than than the music for the reason thet either he cant maintain his range anymore or they wish the vocals to become more intimate than the music.However one major rock winner on this album is 'Save you' reminds you of 'Hail Hail' or Last exit. 'I am mine' and 'love boat Captain' are without doubt among Pearl Jam's finest ever written and the anti Mr President 'Bushleauger' shows how politically outspoken Eddie has become in his lyrics. At times this album can be a bit arrogant and self important which you definitly wouldnt have seen from this band in the 90's.<BR>                                When you compare this band to U2 who go the full promotional and awards distance, Pearl jam should be up their at the grammy's with them, if they only made a video for i am mine or promote the album properly they would emulate U2 which they artistically do anyway.
B00008PW3Q|5.0|Better than anything they've ever done.<BR>Usual Lindsey Buckingham experimental with great songs.<BR>For STUDIO WIZARDRY at it's peak spend a few extra bucks and get the DVD music version if you have a DVD/Digital surround system.<BR>It's mezmorizing to listen to.<BR>Stevie never sounded better, with age came even more grit to that sultry voice.  Lindsey's guitar playing is better than ever.<BR>How anyone can say this is less than a 5-star rating is beyond me.  Again, get the DVD version if you can.  They seemed to have a lot of fun mixing it and it's incredible to listen to.  The Grammys can be very political I know.  But I'm saying this one takes it in 2004.  It's just plain THAT good.  Trust me.
B00005RFAI|5.0|Let me tell you my Pink mini-story. Back when \\"There You Go\\" (off her previous album, Can't Take Me Home), was hit, I heard it and loved it. Quick reserch proved the artist to be one Miss Alecia Moore, better known as Pink. (Not because, as one ediorital review said, of her dyed hair, but becuase of her tendencity to blush.) Anyhow, several days later I heard \\"Most Girls\\". The DJ did not mention the singer, and I just went around humming and wondering. Next time I heard Most Girls, I turned up the volume a bit and listened. Catching in my ears were the words \\"I'm not every girl/and I don't need their world\\". Pink? I wondered. That's exactly the kind of thing she'd be singing. I was right - that's only a hint of how orginal Pink is.<br />\\"M!ssundaztood\\" is, quite sadly, rather missunderstood. It's like a conversation with Pink. The first track proclaims it. She's telling you to listen up. \\"But are you catching all these tracks I'm laying down for you?\\" Tell me, how much more simple does it get? Sorry Pink, there isn't one \\"song I was listening to/up all night\\". I was listening to the whole CD.<br />M!ssundaztood (song, not CD) itself is cute, toe-tapping fare with a sweet refrain. It helps me calm down by assuring me its not me that doesn't understand the world, it's the world not understanding me.<br />Don't Let Me Get Me - don't be fooled by the title, sounding like Can't Take Me Home's melencoly \\"Let Me Let You Know\\". How could someone NOT realate? We have all been mad at ourselves at some point, don't tell me otherwise. Perfect sing-along, but no one will equal Pink's punk-pop energy.<br />Just Like A Pill - here's the cure for anger all wrapped up in three minutes 57 seconds. This song will give me energy whenever I think of it - it deserves a enternal spot rather like \\"Time Of Your Life\\", only a spot that gives it room to express Pink's wild, beat-driven style.<br />Get The Party Started - with this song. It starts with a laugh, a stero back-and-foreth effect that really sounds bad on mono but really cool on headphones, and a beat that will snap fingers of even the most anti-dance amoung us. Pink knows how to manage a beat. Picture yourself in the song, \\"crusing down west side\\" in Pink's Benz, and you're feeling better already. A short disscussion with my friends decided Pink must have bumper stickers to have her \\"licence plate says stunner #1 superstar\\".<br />Respect - pity this wasn't a single. Rap influenced, it starts with a would-be playful beat. Pink's got a message, though. Girl power! \\"Back up boy/I'm not your toy\\", what girl couldn't relate even in the smallest of senses? Reality check, boys - \\"nothing good comes for free\\".<br />18 Wheeler, can't keep me down, or the song.  The beginning starts a bit slow, but then it's irresisable. \\"Hang me like a slave/I'll go underground\\" is a bit of an odd lyric, but Pink has respect (word, not song) for all who've been surpressed. Just one note - that word \\"beautiful\\" in the second verse sounds a whole lot like a sped-up word from Christina Aguilera's \\"Beautiful\\", doesn't it?<br />Family Portrait, and a portrait of sadness. If you've got a less-than-perfect family, I see how you can relate. I can't exactly relate, but this slower song is entirerly heartfelt. It's certianly been overplayed on radio, but you've missed the last minute or so that's been cut off in the radio edit. Wonder what Pink's parents said when they heard it.<br />Misery - an bluesy song for the not-so-misery-stricken miserable. It's not exactly a sad song, but appropriate for someone who's a little hurt. Steven Tyler's first lines, \\"since you been gone/I ain't been the same\\" are far from orginal, but the song is certainly still worth a listen.<br />Dear Diary, I wanna tell my secrets. It's a song from the heart of someone who has no one in which to confide and turns to her diary for help. Don't confuse it with the noise-pollution song of the same title by Britney Spears. Slower, a little echoing, but pretty music.<br />Eventually, eventually, this song will be over. I don't dislike it, but I don't like very much slow music. Still, it's well sung, and real, not space-filling noise. It took a couple listens for me to fully understand the theme. The first time I listened, I fell asleep partway through, then slept throgh Lonely Girl.<br />Lonely Girl - an upbeat song about self-discovery and expectations. The chorus's are the most energetic bits of this song. Linda Perry ends up sounding like Pink's double-echoing guardian angel, and that's not a bad thing. Though it's the sad story of someone famous, don't even think of Britney's \\"Lucky\\". They say the best songs tell stories, that all the best stories have happy endings, and \\"Lonely Girl\\" is no excecption. \\"Lucky\\" mearly is summed up by \\"she is so lucky/but why does she cry\\". Listening to Pink answer \\"Ohh, yeah, yeah\\" to Linda Perry's \\"do you even know who you are?\\" is a most magical moment.<br />Numb - A spunky \\"You Make Me Sick\\" squeal? So, I slept through Lonely Girl - and woke up at the first \\"Numb\\" chorus. Thought Pink used up all her energy on the first 6 tracks? Wrong, way wrong. A well constructed, well lyric-ed, well mixed song for the repressed, ignored, & backstabbed.<br />Gone To California - remote, slow, haunting, faintly techno, song of escape to a promised place that just has (I think) to better than where I am now. Sad, not to mention a little depressing. It belongs to the lonely dark nights, or to someone who wishes to be anywhere but here.<br />My Vietnam - a very long, deary song that starts with echoing banging and lonely whirls of wind. Pink draws out her anthem of hardship and suffering. Whatever happened to the Don't-Let-Me-Get-Me-i'm-awful-i-know-it-and-i-dont-care Pink? It's not a bad song, just a anthem leaving you with mixed thoughts on just how deep her NEXT cd might go. <br />In effect, I only listen to half this CD - tracks one through six, then Numb. Stick to bright pink, would you, Alecia? Slow, haunting pink just isn't my color.
B00005YW4H|5.0|I normally don't jump on the band wagon of &quot;best new artist&quot; as crowned by the &quot;Grammies&quot;. However, after purchasing and listening to Miss Norah Jones's CD for the past week I must concur with their selection, this young woman has a depth and soul to her voice that is simply intoxicating.
B000000H40|5.0|It's a death metal's classic and a pioneer on this genre.<BR>You must get it now!!<BR>John and Don are real Death masters.<BR>Obituary's best album at all!!
B000063DHL|5.0|I was 14 or so when I first bought this album, now at 33 I still love this album. One of the things I have always liked the best about Iron Maiden is the historical content of their lyrics. With Alexander the Great, Powerslave etc the tradition continued. Of course the music itself rocks, and Bruce Dickinson gives a stellar performance. All in all this is one of the best albums this group ever released.
6302719631|5.0|Faithful to the spirit of the book. Thankfully (and unlike some other, respected adaptations of Jane Austen's books), the script retains the humor in Austen's prose. The casting is great, the acting is excellent, with Katharine Schlesinger an absolute stand-out... as Mr. Tilney observed, every thought and feeling shows on her face.

B000002J1M|5.0|Being a fan of classical, contemporary jazz, jazz-rock fusion, and prog rock musics, I was completely surprised to learn that Genesis was not just a pop band.  I was completely enamored with &quot;Watcher Of The Skies&quot; when I first heard it last year for the first time.  Not too many songs are written in 6/4 meter in the key of G-flat (or F-sharp major--see my review for Bob James' LUCKY SEVEN CD).  &quot;Time Table&quot; is, in my opinion, the precursor to SELLING ENGLAND.  &quot;Get 'Em Out By Friday&quot; is a comical (and yet sad) take on future society life.  &quot;Can-Utility And The Coastliners&quot; is the tale of a demigod king.  &quot;Horizons&quot; reminds me of Steve Howe's &quot;Mood For A Day&quot;.  The epic &quot;Supper's Ready&quot; with its multiple sections dealing with the book of Revelation closes us out.  A fine effort indeed!
B000002HIK|5.0|I absolutely love this album...especially #10 Alberto Balsalm and #4 Icct Hedral.  Every song on this album is incredible and i recommend this to anyone who liked Richard D. James Album or is just interested in some good electronica.  Being his first work i do not think that people give Aphex Twin much credit, but that is until they actually hear the cd.  I Care Because You Do undoubtedly deserves these 5 stars.
B00005U18E|5.0|Renee Zellweger must have gained 30 pounds for this movie. She plays a normal, single, hard-working girl just trying to have fun and find a nice guy. Aren't we all?!? Her narration is wonderful, funny and the flirty scenes are hilarious.
B00005JKPF|4.0|I thought that this was a great movie, but I don't want to talk about the movie a whole lot. The visual affects in this movie were great and the acting was awesome. This movie should hopefully throughout the weeks beat the rather dumb Marvel comic Daredevil in the box-office. This classic Marvel comic X-men had a better plot and it had some really cool characters. The best actors in a comic book movie ever so far! Huge Jackman, Halle Berry, Alan Cumming, Rebecca R. Stamos, Brian Cox, and many more great actors. I don't want to give the ending away or accually any of it away. It was an awesome movie and even Erbert and Roeper both gave it thumbs up! I would say don't even wait until video, go see it in theaters!
B00000JCOV|4.0|I must say that i thought that the guys in Slipknot looked really silly in there &quot;scary&quot; masks <BR>the first time i saw them in a magazine.<BR>But haven't it bin for the bands &quot;Scary image&quot; they probably hadn't made the magazine to <BR>begin with  and I might newer had taken a closer look at their music.<BR>I bought the album Iowa before I bought this one (Iowa is the new Slipknot album), after <BR>listening to Iowa not buying this album was no option because iowa is  absolutely brilliant <BR>so the &quot;old&quot; one had to be explored.<BR>This one (the old or no name one, what ever you chose to call it) is a fast and angry album <BR>that smells of dirt and goatblood.<BR>Put it on then it's raining or whenever you feel like getting a speeding ticket, because there <BR>is no stopping this one baby.... I love it.<br />Super Dave
B00005JLWN|1.0|The movie´s story line is awfull, no major special effects, in fact, it has absolutely nothing special on it, just a silly story about a quasi Hitler/Goebels lunatic messing with people´s minds for no purpose at all.<BR>I even asked the rental to return me the money I spent on it, as it was on their recomendations display.<br />DONT GET NEAR IT.

B00005JLEU|4.0|Considered Miyazaki's masterpiece, Spirited Away is one of the better animated movies that I've seen.  The only other Miyazaki film I've seen is Castle in the Sky, and this Spirited Away blows Castle away.  This is a superior film.  Much of today's American animation is grounded in reality (even if you have talking lions and space aliens).  Nothing feels foreign or truly magical.  Miyazaki truly has a sense of the fantastic.  Images and characters in his work are truly foreign and magical.  Spirited Away is perhaps the best example of this.  There is a No-Face character (a mostly fluid black shape with a mask) that has no characteristics that we can identify as human (as a contrast, Stich from \\"Lilo and Stich\\" is a space alien but isn't too far off from human emotions and motivations).  No-Face is an interesting, and occasionally frightening, character.<br />The story follows Chihiro, a young girl whose family is just moving to a new city.  On the way to the house the father takes a shortcut.  The short cut is a dead end, but there is a pathway through some buildings.  The parents decide to investigate (over the objections of Chihiro).  After passing through a tunnel they come to what they believe is an abandoned amusement park....with the smells of cooking food.  Hungrily, the parents chase down the smell and see a large amount of food laid out on a countertop.  The parents sit down and eat, cajoling Chihiro to do the same.  She runs away, and is warned by Haku (a more important character later) to get out before nightfall.  She runs back to her parents but only see two large pigs gorging on food....right where her parents were.  She runs, frightened, but ends up not being able to get out.  She finds herself in a magical world where there are very few humans (who work nearly like slaves for a bath house).  Haku helps her get a job in the bath house, saving Chihiro from being turned to a pig like her parents.  The movie is her experience in the bathhouse and how she tries to rescue herself and her parents.<br />This is a fantastic movie, and deservedly won the Best Animated Film Oscar at the Academy Awards.tries to rescue herself and her parents.  <br />This is a fantastic movie, and deservedly won the Best Animated Film Oscar at the Academy Awards.
B00005V9IK|5.0|Independence Day Offers Fireworks and Thrills<br /> One of the best science fiction films made in recent years, Roland Emmerich's Independence Day highlights a clever script, an A-list cast (which includes Will Smith, Jeff Goldblum, Judd Hirsch, Margaret Colin, and Robert Loggia, just to name a few of the actors) and eye-popping special effects.<br />This film is essentially a 1950s \\"flying saucers attack Earth\\" movie - indeed, it is almost a remake of George Pal's War of the Worlds, which some of us baby boomers may recall seeing either as a \\"Creature Features\\" offering on independent television stations in the 1970s or as a Late Show feature when networks like ABC and CBS carried feature films in those pre-\\"Nightline,\\" pre-David Letterman days....uh, nights. The plot is essentially the same as most \\"alien invasion\\" movies of those Red-scare 1950s: flying saucers appear literally out of the blue, we try to make contact, they invade, we resist.  Chaos ensues, there are big battles with the Bug Eyed Monsters (BEMs), cities are destroyed, and the war goes the BEMs' way until some scientist or brave military hero comes up with either a wonder weapon or last-minute desperation tactic and saves the day.  (And often in these movies the male lead ended up smooching with the female lead....)<br />And it is exactly this back-to-the-future \\"retro\\" feel that is the heart of Independence Day's appeal.  It takes all these clich&eacute;s and makes them work in such a way that audiences familiar with \\"invaders from space\\" can recognize the tongue-in-cheek tone of Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich's screenplay and smile, and there are lots of visual and dialogue tips of the hats to films such as Star Wars, Close Encounters of the Third Kind and other science fiction series.  Still, the strongest influence is War of the Worlds, not only thematically but structurally as well.<br />For instance, in both the original 1890s novel and the modernized George Pal version of War of the Worlds, a trio of emissaries waving a white flag approach the Martians' landing cylinder, only to be vaporized by the invaders' heat ray.  In Independence Day there is a similar scene, when a trio of especially fitted helicopters attempts to communicate with the aliens' ship over Washington.  The aliens respond to this Close Encounters-style light show with a violent show of force.<br />In another echo of Pal's 1950s movie, President Thomas J. Whitmore (Bill Pullman) reluctantly orders a B-2 Spirit to attack one of the alien vessels with nuclear weapons.  Not only does the attack fail miserably as in War of the Worlds, but the B-2A itself is based on the Northrop \\"flying wing\\" which appeared in the older film (making use of stock film of test flight footage, since the flying wing was never in U.S. Air Force service).<br />Even the ending is derived from H.G. Wells' novel, though the twist that Devlin and Emmerich used was not only clever but very 1990s.  Instead of being infected by Earth germs as the Martians were in War of the Worlds, in this film the creepy BEMs are done in by....a computer virus created by David Levinson (Goldblum).  (And if you have not seen the sequence when Levinson and Marine pilot Steven Hiller [Smith] plant the virus aboard the alien ship, keep your eyes open for a reference to another classic science fiction film!)<br />Independence Day comes in two versions of the DVD: a barebones one-disc edition which has both the theatrical and Special Editions of the movie, commentary by Emmerich and Devlin, commentary by the visual effects supervisors, plus the usual language and subtitles options.  20th Century Fox Home Entertainment also released a pricier 2-disc Five Star Collection edition which has this disc plus another extra features disc.  I have the one-disc edition, and though I miss the theatrical trailers and other goodies, I am satisfied with the DVD I own.of emissaries waving a white flag approach the Martians' landing cylinder, only to be vaporized by the invaders' heat ray.

B00005JKPF|5.0|Bryan Singer should be proud of his work on X2.  Not only did he have to keep the fans of the first movie happy, he had to continue to please the fans of comics happy, keep Marvel happy and at the same time he had to improve upon the first X-Men movie.  Oh, and he also had to make the studio a lot of money to recover for the investment of making the movie.  No small task, for any of it.  What does Bryan Singer do?  He makes a better movie and improves on all aspects of the first X-Men film.<br />The movie starts with an amazing attack on the President by Nightcrawler (a teleporter).  Throughout the movie, Nightcrawler was the most interesting character with the best mutant talent (as far as how it plays out on screen), and the action involving Nightcrawler (Alan Cumming) was just so visually impressive that I just had to sit back in near awe at how impressive his scenes were.  The first one was the most impressive, but Nightcrawler is what helped make this movie as good as it ended up being.<br />With this attack on the President, General Stryker (Brian Cox) takes this as his opportunity to attack the Xavier School for Gifted Youngsters (AKA the base for the X-Men and a training school for mutants).  At the time of the attack, Professor X (Patrick Stewart), Cyclops (James Marsden), Jean Grey (Famke Jannsen), and Storm (Halle Berry) are all away from the school.  This only leaves Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) left to defend the students.  This attack gives Wolverine to really shine and show why he is one of the toughest members of the X-Men.<br />Magneto (Ian McKellan) is still in his glass prison and Mystique (Rebecca Romijn Stamos) is working to free him.  I don't want to keep repeating myself, but this is yet another very impressive scene.  The attack on the school forces the mutants (X-Men and Magneto) to band together to fight off the threat of General Stryker and Lady Deathstryke (Kelly Hu).  Stryker is working to rid the world (or at least America) of mutants.<br />This is one of the better comic book movies that have come out recently.  While it may not be as good as Batman (1989) or the first Superman, this is better than most.  There is so much more action than the first X-Men movie and it sets up a sequel (probably the third and final X-Men film that Bryan Singer makes).  This is much darker than the first movie and is worth watching for fans of action movies, comics, or just the X-Men.  It is a lot of fun to watch and I'm very glad that I went to see this one.<br />This is one of the better comic book movies that have come out recently.

Hay un track escondido que es full precioso. El disco es muy bueno en lineas generales. Se nota mucho la influencia hip hop que trae Damon Albarn de Gorillaz. Se los recomiendo altamente.

B0000640VO|5.0|I can't be unhappy while watching this gem, it's hard to describe. But, as a movie about taking chances to improve your life, and a movie about love, it's amazing that it really evokes an emotional response from me.<br />It feels a lot like that burst of happiness you feel when you are just falling in love.<br />Hard day at work, this is the prescription for you, I was grumpy last night and popped this in, and found myself grinning several times. Similar feeling when I saw this in theatres.<br />This is not a movie to miss. It's clever, it's beautiful, and Audrey is amazing in this.
B0000931OG|5.0|Que hermoso disco nos trae la gente de Blur. Un disco demasiado bueno. NO tiene desperdicio. La atmosfera es mas tranquila, con canciones algo tragicas y con mucho contenido social. A excepción de crazy beat y We've got file on you.. las canciones son suaves con mucho ritmo, y con mucha influencia Hip Hop, que seguro trajo Damon albarn de Gorillaz. Hay un Track escondido, que es demasiado hermoso. Se los recomiendo. El cambio evolutivo es estupendo, siempre manteniendo ese sonido tipico del grupo.<br />Saludos<br />Noel
B00005JLEU|4.0|Hayao Miyazaki's \\"Spirited Away\\" will be a revelation -- and a test -- for mainstream U.S. audiences. It is, indeed, a foreign film. While made for children, its parade of surreal and often disturbing images seem worlds apart from Disney's usual fare. At times, the film appears better suited for the Ecstasy crowd than the Nickelodeon generation.<br /> Disney, to its credit, presents \\"Spirited Away\\" with no cuts or alterations, an essential provision in the deal with Miyazaki.  The film is presented in widescreen (2.00:1) with Dolby Digital 5.1 sound on its English-language track. Those preferring the original Japanese voice talent must settle for Dolby 2.0. Visuals and audio are up to studio standards.<br />The DVD set's extras work well as an introduction to Miyazaki. A Nippon TV making-of follows Miyazaki and his team of young animators as they create \\"Spirited Away.\\" The docu slips into \\"Iron Chef\\" territory as it chronicles the team's deadline pressures -- \\"Something's wrong with the copier!\\" -- but it's a peek at Miyazaki's working life that should intrigue pros and ani fans. Of particular interest are the extended scenes of the director, 62, coaxing performances from his young vocal talent.<br />A second making-of piece -- standard Disney issue -- covers the U.S. team's work on translation and dubbing. English-language writers Cindy and Donald Hewitt tell how they struggled to translate concepts such as the Japanese kids' sign for a shot that guards against cooties.<br />This is masterpiece, but it's also a seriously weird movie that runs long. The director's \\"Castle in the Sky\\" (1986) and \\"Kiki's Delivery Service\\" (1989) are more conventional anime adventures better suited for younger children.
B00008NG5V|2.0|Lots of old reworked songs here.  Standouts are Taylor, Gone, Tomorrow Morning, Holes to Heaven.  There are a few songs I found difficult to listen to...I think he could of made a more cohesive album by removing 4 or 5 of the 16 tracks.  He's still one very talented guy, but I'm not blown away by this CD.
B00008WG3U|5.0|This is one of the best punk cd's I have ever listened to.  It is pure punk rock.  I think it my be their best album.  I am 13 years old and these guys have been my favorite band for a wile now.  So if you like punk music don't forget to pick this up. I love all the songs on this cd but my favorite is the seperation of church and skate.
B00004STPT|5.0|In my opinion, Hans Zimmer does his best job yet of composing scores with Gladiator, even better than the Black Hawk Down soundtrack. Gladiator is a score in which Hans Zimmer plays the world of the Roman Empire, combining world music and Wagnerian pomp, resulting in a soundtrack that fans of the movie itself and Hans Zimmer's scores shouldn't miss out on owning. I myself bought this soundtrack before even seeing the movie because I became a fan of Zimmer's scores when I purchased the Black Hawk Down soundtrack. After listening to the Gladiator soundtrack all the way through, I concluded that this score is even better than Black Hawk Down's score. Even if you have not seen the movie or ever heard Hans Zimmer's scores, I still highly reccomend this soundtrack to anyone. 5 stars.
B00008NG5V|5.0|Jack does it again!  Another great, great album.  This album starts out strong, with \\"The Horizon Has Been Defeated,\\" \\"Taylor,\\" \\"Gone,\\" and \\"Cupid.\\"  However, it doesn't lose any steam.  \\"Dreams be Dreams\\" is a great song.  Rodeo Clowns is done a little differently this time.  Jack keeps it real simple on this album and it really works.  Get this CD.
B00008NG5V|4.0|good tunes. better than the first. i think jack has found his sound. i can see the sunset in my head when i listen to this cd. for those that liked his first record, you won't be disappointed.
0811828697|5.0|This book is quite possibly the most masterful artistic compilation relating to Star Wars that has been put out in recent years.  From the \\"dewback hide\\" covers and through every page in between, the reader finds himself immersed in a vision of the Star Wars universe that is so lavish and full of life that he may not want to leave.  Clearly, the people who put this book together were not working on a project, they were building a labor of love, and it shows on every page.  And yes, it really *is* an excellent wildlife reference too! <br />If you're buying this book for yourself, it will stand out as the pride of your Star Wars library for years to come.  If you're buying it as a gift for a fan of any age, prepare to be showered with gratitude.  The book is so endearing that even people who may not necessarily be fans of the genre will certainly come to admire it.  The Wildlife of Star Wars is well worth every penny.
B00005JLK1|2.0|Dull, uninspired, derivative, insipid, etc are just a few of the words that come to mind after watching this stinker.  The best moment comes in first 5 mintues and goes downhill from there.  The contrived &quot;surprise&quot; ending that seems to be a necessity for bad horror movies feels particularly takced on here.  It's not scary, but it might have been.  To its credit there a few scenes of distrubing gore but that's as far as it goes.  No real suspense.  It's not so bad you turn it off.  I might have given it one star but I watched Darkness Falls the same night and it was worse.
038572179X|5.0|Every now and then, you come across a book that is superb in every way.  ATONEMENT by Ian McEwan is such a book.  From the beginning to end, I was enraptured by McEwan's writing.  Briony, the little girl that greets the reader on the first page, is definitely me as a child in every way down to her pudgy knees (see the front cover of the paperback edition).  Just like Briony, I was constantly writing stories and plays and hiding things in secret compartment around my room.  Fantasy was more real than reality.  When innocent young Briony finally decides that real life could be more interesting than her fantasy world, she goes a little too far too fast.  And the scarey part is that I can picture myself accidently committing Briony's crime.  It's Briony's crime and search for atonement from that crime that is the catalyst for the rest of the story.<br />Ian McEwan makes his characters and history come to life.  He touches the marrow of human existence and breaks it down to it's basest form.  You have something in common with these characters simply in your humanity.  And even if the characters aren't as much like you as Briony is like me, you will find yourself running alongside Robbie in the French countryside in World War II, hiding as planes bomb the roadway from above.  And you feel the immediacy and tenderness of Briony as she nurses broken soldiers back to health almost wishing you could help them somehow, too.<br />The ending is quite interesting.  Without giving it away in the least, I can say that Briony has finally learned where and when fact and fantasy are most appropriate.  When I reached the end of this novel I was determined to read every novel ever written by Ian McEwan.  This novel is truly one of the best I've ever read.  Although some people have difficulty getting into the book, I was throughly engrossed from beginning to end.  I wanted to re-read what I'd just read rather than go onward and come to the end of this magnificent book.
B000000XCF|5.0|A great album from a great band! Another amazing display of southern influenced rock from a bunch of California boys.  Hard to believe that John Fogerty had never even been to the American South until well after his intial successes with CCR.  In similar fashion, Fogerty was able to write very some very convincing anti-war songs like \\"Fortunate Son\\" (and \\"Run Through the Jungle\\",off of Cosmo's Factory), even though he did not serve in Vietnam, as mistakenly reported in another review.  Just goes to show how great and imaginative a songwriter Fogerty was.  This is one of their best records, and is highly recommended.  Non-hit highlights include \\"Effigy\\",\\"It Came Out of The Sky\\", \\"Cotton Fields\\", and \\"The Midnight Special\\".  This album was logical follow up to their classic \\"Green River\\", and the stepping stone to their best album, \\"Cosmo's Factory\\".  No collection of recordings for this group is complete without it. it.
0803723865|5.0|Whatever I might write about this book will hardly convey how wonderful it is. It is an ace in ALL categories, illustrations are beautiful and fun, story is lovley, clever, sweet and original, kids LOVE LOVE LOVE it; parents love it. What more can you ask. Buy it, and I am sure you will want to pass it on to all your friends' kids too so that they won't miss out. We have all Julias books and NONE disappoint.
078401213X|5.0|I am not a mathematician. However, I can usually see how things work, the schematics, the overall structure of something. Looking for the structure of a thing,the theory, the pattern, is something that fascinates me. It is part of the work I do. This film is therefore very appealing to me. No, a better word is compelling. The young man in this film is searching for a (or THE)pattern, the structure of random numbers, the web inherent in Chaos theory. Other, more selfish people in the film try to use the protagonist, but those people are also searching. The Hasidic man is searching for the structure of the Deity, the numeric key to the name of G-d. The stock broker is searching for the overall numeric pattern of the Market. All seek an explanation, born out of Wonder. So, I can't bring myself to dislike any of the people in the film who are searching for the Answer, the Structure. All of us, to a greater or lesser degree, are searching for answers, the why of things. The search for the why or how of things is what enobles men and women. As a Buddhist, I should say \\"the path is the Goal,\\" but that is too pat an answer, even if it is correct. This film is a wonderful examination of our shared obsession of Seeking. It explores both the depth of mind and the limitation of Mind. It is as engrossing and compelling a film as any I've ever seen. I recommend it. It deserves (and requiries) more than one viewing.
158234082X|2.0|Mr. Bourdain paints a not-too-pretty picture, which may or may not be accurate, of the NYC restaurant scene over the last 15 years, reminding the reader over and over of the drug-induced craziness that goes on in his kitchen at one failing joint after another. Of course they mostly fail due to \\"owner inept\\", but then the sods get what they deserve, he says. <BR>But is it relevant, or even real? He spends the first 24 chapters reeling off story after story showing how depraved the whole scene is, and then finally admits that, well, not ALL restaurants are like this, maybe not even most. The chapter near the end where he talks about a really good chef, much better than himself (his words) shoots huge holes in all the previous rantings, showing that, most likely, the common cause in all these \\"pirate ship\\" kitchens he has been running is, not surprisingly, himself!<BR>There are two or thre worthwhile chapters, of course, and the \\"Day in the Life\\" chapter about what a chef goes through is very interesting. <BR>If you think the whole world revolves around what people with lots of money are eating in lower Manhattan, you'll probably love this book. The rest of us could have been happy with just a few chapters. Thankfully a friend loaned me this book, as I would have felt liked I'd been served a shoe-leather steak if I'd paid real money for it. Send the waiter back to the kitchen with this one.
B00008S2VH|3.0|Madonna's latest effort, American Life, continues in the same footsteps as her 2000 release Music. Unlike Music, this cd isn't nearly as fun and Madonna comes across as being bored, bitter and disturbed. One listen to this album makes you wonder if Madonna, who's always come across as thought provoking, has just simply gone mad. <br />1. American Life - Besides the rap, there's zero interesting about this song. Madonna repeats the same few lines over and over again and we're supposed to buy that it's deep and meaningful. Yeah, something's deep alright. And even when she finally realizes the creativity of the song doesn't exist, she does what she does best, throws in an F word several times. In the past, her doing that was cool and rebellious, now it's just sad. 7/10<br />2. Hollywood - I really like this song despite it's silly effects in the background where you hear birds chirping; which is exactly what I imagine circling over her head when she made this record. Madonna finally turns her back on Hollywood as she sarcastically claims how amazing it is and how good it'll make you feel. The music on this track is really nice and her voice sounds really nice and sweet especially when she says \\"You're in Hollywood\\". - 8/10<br />3. I'm So Stupid - This is one of my favorite tracks on the cd. The guitars and electronica sound really good together and go really well with her voice. Madonna sings about being naive and of course, being stupid. 8/10<br />4. Love Profusion - This is where Madonna tries really hard to be deep and thought provoking. She sings about love and how good it is and how bad it is and how good it can be when it's bad and how bad it can be when it's good. Got it? Me neither. However, it's got a nice beat and a great hook. Not bad at all. My favorite part is where she sings \\"I've got you under my skin\\". So very true. 7/10<br />5. Nobody Knows Me - In this song, another of my favorites, Madonna goes on about how many lives she's had and how times she's died. She goes on to say \\"I'm not that kind of guy. Sometimes I feel shy. I think I can fly.\\" I guess nobody really does know her. Maybe she should have kept that quiet. Later in the song she proclaims that \\"I don't want no lies. I don't watch TV. I don't waste my time reading magazines.\\" Yeah, it sounds like she can really relate to the \\"American Life\\". 8/10<br />6. Nothing Fails - This is easily my favorite song on the album. Madonna made a big mistake not releasing this as her first single, but of course she had to use the war and tease us with her American Life video just to make headlines once again which makes track #5 a load of BS. However, this song is tender and genuine and I really enjoy it. It has a Like A Prayer vibe, but the lyrics are really sweet and loving and I love this song. 10/10<br />7. Intervention - I really love this song too. I'm not too sure what it's about, but it has a really sad and mellow feel to it. Unlike every other track on the album, this song isn't flashy or showy at all. It's a really simple acoustic song. I believe it's about love being able to save people from any kind of problems they're going through. I agree with that. This song is a gem and I hope she releases it as a single. 10/10<br />8. X-Static Process - I like this song, but this is the lamest song ever. I can imagine those birds from track #2 circling her head when she wrote this. This is one of those songs where the lyrics are so \\"deep\\" yet so vague that you can really interpret the song into meaning whatever you want it to. 5/10<br />9. Mother & Father - Madonna goes back to the 80s with this song. This song has an 80s feel to it and she raps on this track as well, sort of. Its a decent track, but not one of my favorites. She should really try hard to abandon the deep thinking songs and do more songs like this. 6/10<br />10. Die Another Day - Why this song is on the album is beyond me. Although I do like it alot, it sticks out like a sore thumb. Not only because it makes zero sense, but because its what the rest of the album tried so hard to be and failed. I think this was an excellent theme to an excellent movie. 9/10<br />11. Easy Ride - This song is pretty okay, but also not one of my favorites. Madonna ends yet another album on a mellow note. On Music she ended her cd with the terrific song \\"Gone\\", on this cd she ends the album with a less than terrific song still going on and on about how troubled she is, yet she wants to live forever. Lets pray this style of music doesn't live forever. 6/10<br />All in all, Madonna has done this sound to death. The songs are old and their appeals have quickly worn off. Nothing on this album is as good as \\"Music\\" or \\"Tell Me\\" or \\"Gone\\". Madonna sings about \\"Hollywood\\" a place in which she left, but is still so obviously desperate to conquer. She goes on and on about an \\"American Life\\" in which she's betrayed and she raps about all of the things she has. You'll notice that she doesn't mention a therapist, only nannies, agents and bodyguards. It's time for me to express MY extreme point of view to Madonna, see a shrink.
B00008WG3U|4.0|its a good album. different than nofx. you might think its not nofx. nut i can assure you it is. i checked on the cd cover. trust me. its good. good album. slatfats and hpz were better. it doesnt compare to PID but its good. good album here. folks.
B000083E79|4.0|Ever since I was a little boy I remember listening to Cher and thinking how amazing she was (and still is!). From the sounds of the 70s to the rock songs of the 80s and even to the dance songs from the 90s and today, there isn't much Cher hasn't done. From turning heads on the big screen to moonlighting on the small screen, there will only be one diva who can claim she started and did it all. Now comes a compilation of Cher's Greatest Hits and finest moments. Decades of songs and memories will come to mind as you listen to this cd. This cd is almost perfect and I would have given it 5 stars had it included one of my favorite songs and one of her biggest hits - Love And Understanding. Other than excluding that wonderful track, this cd is wonderful and filled with countless hits. You don't know the power of Cher until you own this cd. I urge everyone to pick themselves up a copy right away!
B00005O3VC|5.0|I already owned this Python classic on VHS, but decided to treat myself to the DVD, based on the added value of the extras. Good move! Lots of fascinating background material providing insights into the fevered imaginations of the Terrys and some totally new stuff including Michael Palin's cocoanut sketch and the utterly bizarre but delightful MP&amp;THG in Lego!  The sing-a-long-a-Sir-Robin got the whole household joining in and the option for the weird but inspired Shakespearean-style subtitles adds a whole new dimension.<br />And all that before I mention the film itself! What more can I add? You all know how side-splittingly funny are the scenes with the plague village, the French taunter, burn the witch, the oppressed peasant, Sir Galahad's rescue of the prince in the tower, brave Sir Robin, the knights of NI, the killer bunny,  the bridge of doom etc.  I'm undecided whether this or Life of Brian is the funniest movie ever made but whatever, this is a must have purchase and the best value for money DVD in my collection.
6301969413|5.0|1968 was indeed a very busy year in terms of classic films. Films such as 2001:A Space Odyssey, Planet Of The Apes, Thunderbird 6, Romeo and Juliet, The Lost Continent, among the many. However, they were not as powerful as this Cinerama release. One that made reclusive billionaire Howard Hughes watch this movie over and over, without ever becoming bored. It is easy to understand why. Ice Station Zebra is also a favorite movie of mine, too.<br />Based on British novelist Alistar MacLean's classic Cold War action adventure/political thriller, the box office smash hit MGM film focuses on a downed Russian satellite in the Artic Circle region. A satellite that crashes near a British civilian weather research station known as Ice Station Zebra. The English scientists discover that the satellite contains film of Western power missile sites and other defense instillations. At the same time of the discovery, disaster hits the station in the form of explosive sabotage. Enter into the picture Captain James Ferraday and the crew of the United States Naval Submarine U.S.S. Tigerfish. Ferraday is given orders to bring British intelligence agent David Jones, former Russian agent turned defector Boris Vaslov, U.S. Marine Captain Leslie Anders and a platoon squad of Marine sharpshooters. While officially their mission is to rescue the scientists in the North Pole, unofficially, they are ordered to recover the satellite, obtain the film, and prevent it from falling into the hands of the Union Of The Soviet Socialistic Republic.<br />Not everything is all that it seems to be on the \\"rescue mission.\\" The submarine is nearly destroyed by sabotage. When the Tigerfish arrives at Ice Station Zebra, it is soon discovered that there is a double agent among the crew and scientists. And this double agent is a madman who will stop at nothing to obtain the film and kill those who get in the way. <br />When both Anders and Vaslov are accidentally killed and a squad of Russian paratroopers arriveon the scene, it soon becomes a struggle to maintain the balance of world power, and prevent the Cold War from becoming a thermonuclear war between the United States of America and Soviet Russia.<br />Like The Guns Of Navarone, Force 10 From Navarone, and Bear Island, Ice Station Zebra is shockingly timely as tomorrow's headlines. The movie truly reflects the Cold War period of the late Sixties with powerful results. From the cold, deadly beauty of the world under the ice to the howling fury of an artic blizzard, the 1968 MGM film painstakingly records every twist and turn with upmost realism. It perfectly demonstrates how complex world politics and the balance of power can be, but most of all, it can demonstrate how something mass produced by either side can literally change the structure of our world.<br />If you enjoy action and adventure, as well technothrillers, cold war classics, science fiction, or just war movies in general, then you will not be disappointed by this classic form of entertainment. The race is on, so join the fun at Ice Station Zebra.<br />The film stars the late Rock Hudson, Ernest Borgnine, British actor Patrick McGoohan, Jim Brown, Tony Bill, Michael Rougas, Alf Kjellin, Ron Masak, William O'Connell, Jim Goodwin, Michael Mikler, Gerald S. O'Laughlin, Ted Hartley, Lloyd Haynes, and the late Lloyd Nolan.
B00008NG5V|4.0|Jack Johnson does it again, his sophmore album is a continuation of his first albume &quot;BRUSHFIRE FAIRYTALES&quot; nothing has changed here, it could almost be the second disc to the first CD is sounds so much like his first album. Which is good and bad, good in the sense you know what to expect and will enjoy more classic jams, on the hand some people may have wished for something slightly different. <br />Overall I have listend to the tracks a few times, and I like the album a lot, but it seems more mellow than the first album, almost too mellow at times, and not quite as upbeat at the first album, but overall another great Jack Johson album, if you like the first you should like the second album, just a little smoother this time around...
B0000067L2|4.0|Cream is the very definition of a blues rock band. You have Eric Clapton, who's just laying down the wickedest solos I've ever heard. Jack Bruce, who is the god of rythym. And Ginger Baker, who brought jazz drumming into rock and roll. This is their best album. While their albums sort of lacked the spark in their live shows, this album is probably the closest thing to perfect. The classics are on here. Strange Brew, Sunshine Of Your Love, SWLABR, and Tales of Brave Uylesses. Yet there's some underrated blues songs like Take It Back and Outside Woman Blues. And there's some interesting physcedelia like World Of Pain and We're Going Wrong. The only downside is Dance The Night Away, which sounds like a Syd Barret rip-off with higher vocals, and the slow filler Blue Condition. But that doesn't hurt the classics. Very good album.
B000002UAU|5.0|This is a must-have album for all Beatles fans! It is also some of their best work for those who would like to &quot;explore&quot; The Beatles' work. I can put this album on and listen to it straight through. Even, in my opinion, the weakest song (Within You, Without You) is nothing to skip. The Beatles consistently show the ability to put forth excellent albums. I only wish, as a 14 year old, that I could have been around to experience their music as it was coming out.
B00005JKPF|5.0|X2 starts out with the character of Nightcrawler (a big comic fave) breaking into the White House.  From there, it goes on to show Wolverine's return and the movie begins.  While I thought X-Men was a wonderful movie, albeit a bit stifled due to the need to explain characters, I do believe that X2: X-Men United is twice as good.  I nearly jumped out of my seat so many times due to the wonderful actions sequences and suspenseful parts that I lost count! A major new addition (other than Nightcrawler) is the enhancement of Iceman and Pyro.  You can obviously tell that Iceman cares deeply for Rogue, and that Pyro feels like an outcast.  Now, I dont' want to give away the ending, but a painful sacrifice will show you just how much you have come to care about the characters, and how good a movie this is.  X3, here I come!
B00008NG5V|5.0|this cd is good acually. i was expecting it to be just a collage of the same ol thing.  but jack did it yet again with On and On.  16 tracks, all fairly short, but very good.  it just reminds me of somone sitting out on the beach writing little tunes, finalizing them, and putting them on record.  great cd!
B000059RL3|4.0|First off, let me explain the four stars versus five star rank.  If you care about popular music, paricularly soul or R&amp;B music, this album goes way above five stars in ranking.  It was marked to four stars simply because for the casual fan, this edition may be just too much.  You should own this disc, but maybe a single disc version is all you need.  If you love Gaye, five stars is not enough to express the quality of this disc.<br />The first disc includes a remastered version of the original album.  When released, this album was revolutionary, a breathtaking statement of vision and belief by one of soul musics most important singers.  Gaye had been one of Motown's most popular singers in the '60s, but wanted to do more than just sing love songs.  Breaking away from the Motown production machine, he made this album, a broad cycle of songs about the state of the USA circa 1970, from a proud black man's view, as well as from everyone's view in terms of problems with the environment (remember, the Cuyahoga River in Cleveland had caught fire from pollutants spewn into the river just two or three years earlier).  This is also tied with statements of faith (God Is Love) just asking, 20 years before Rodney King, why can't we just love one another?  <br />For the casual fan, the disc may just be overload.  The first disc is the original version of the album, followed by an alternate mix.  The alternate is not a complete reworking of the album, mostly it is different vocals. The last cut is an instrumental version of the title song that is very smooth.<br />The second disc is a concert at the Kennedy Center in 1973, where they basically recreate the album in concert.  Also included is a 13+ minute medley of his hit songs from the '60s.  After the concert are three singles versions of the songs, and the album finishes with a stream of consciousness creation of a song that he was struggling to find words to a groove he had already created.<br />As an obsessive on this kind of thing, I really enjoyed this deluxe version of the album.  I would highly recomend it to the fan who wants to see how albums can change with different mixes of the same song.  For music lovers that don't really care about that and just want to groove, buy the single disc version of the album.  Whichever format you choose, though, this album should be in your collection.
B0000640VO|5.0|Brilliant. One of the few DVDs I'd own, if I were a collector of DVDs.
B00007KQA3|5.0|1984 has always been one of my favorite books, and this is one of the most successful book adaptations I have ever seen.  I also want to say that I don't miss the Eurythmics contributions to the score at all.  This comes from a fan of the group and a proud owner of their original soundtrack recording.  My recommendation: buy this DVD and the Eurythmics soundtrack and enjoy them seperately.  The new score is a better fit, although I would have gladly paid a little more money to have both versions of the film.  As far as special features are concerned, forget it -- this is a bare-bones release.   Normally, I might dock a star for that, but I'm so grateful to be able to watch this wonderful movie on DVD, I just don't care.
0385504209|5.0|Completely enthralling, and thought provoking, The DaVinci Code, by Dan Brown is my pick for Book of the Year. Read in one sitting, with a glass of milk and only one sock change, i would have to say that this Novel purely ROCKED!
B000089CJI|5.0|This CD is the best I've heard so far this year. It combines great production with great vocals to create something that is not like anything I have ever heard before. The beats are a combination of 80's syths with some tech-ish drum &amp; bass-esque sounds. The vocals are also excellent. You'll be singing this CD constantly, definitely a worthy investment.
0804115613|5.0|Told in anecdote format, including short articles in the local newspaper by Dot Weems, this story focuses on Mrs. Threadgoode, an old lady in a nursing home, looking back on her life in Whistle Stop, Alabama. The cafe run by Idgie and Ruth, women in love with each other, was the focal point of all the little town's life. There's an unsolved murder threaded like a hank of old yarn that runs through the tale, and once you've finished the book, you'll never again feel quite the same about eating southern barbecue.<BR>Fannie Flagg manages in this small book to deal with some of the great literary themes: racism, sexism, ageism, love, disability, death, and grief.<BR>The stories run backwards and forwards in time, just as an old lady's mind does, and sometimes it gets a bit confusing, but it you make a point of checking the date at the top of each entry, you won't get lost.<BR>On top of all that, there are some great recipes at the end, including of course, one for fried green tomatoes. I tried it. Delicious, just like the book itself.
B00005JLET|3.0|I'm going to Japan this summer, so after reading all the great reviews on this site, I thought this movie would be a great thing to watch. I was quite disappointed.<br />There is no denying that the animation is great. Everything is very nicely drawn. However the story is confusing. The story revolves around a young girl who becomes trapped in a magical world is spirits. I don't know where these spirits came from or what they do. It seems that this girl is constantly getting scared and running away from scary spirits. But the movie never explains why these spirits don't like humans. She befriends another young boy who turns into a dragon. How and why does he turn into a dragon? I'm so confused.<br />This was the first anime movie I've ever watched. Perhaps Japanese people know more about Japanese stories and mythology and can fill in the gaps. But for a North American audience I feel that more should have been explained.<br />Overall, this movie is worth watching. However I suggest renting it instead of buying it.
B00008NG5V|5.0|I really dislike the comparisons to Donovan Lovin' Spoonful. Jack Johnson has surpassed them both combined in number of good songs. I think Donavan had 4. Anyway... Jack plays sober and actually has something to say that's worth hearing. And even more so... he makes it awfully easy to listen to. Rolling Stone said this album was to mellow and similar too Brushfire Fairytales. Boy, am I glad it is. But there is plenty of growth for this to be a great CD. It is, simply, some of the best chillin' music I've ever heard. Period.
0714834491|5.0|I had never heard of this book before I saw it and no introduction is better than just getting the huge, heavy thing on your lap and looking through it. As most reviewers of this book have said, it cannot be described, but they have tried. I too can only give you an idea about this book and giving ideas is what this book is about. <BR>      One day my friend Martine said that I must see this book and dropped it into my lap, I have not yet give it back. I sat there in my comfy chair and leafed through the many, many pages reading a little here, looking a little there. After a while I realised that this book was an amazing source of information and inspiration and so I started reading from the beginning, taking notes along the way. <BR>     Todd Dominey, a new media designer, wrote, \\"As a designer, I felt more inspired, more aware, more energized after just a handful of pages than I can remember feeling in years of buying design and art related books.\\" As indicated by its title, this book is meant to open your mind, to get you seeing the things you never noticed before, to give you a fresh perspective and a new way of understanding. <BR>     On the first real page of the book a  quote by Montaigne reads &quot;I quote others only the better to express myself.&quot; This book has over a thousand quotes from writers, philosophers, artists and anyone who has ever said anything thoughtful. A quote starts each of the books 72 chapters, each having a loose theme such as 'Imagination', 'Noise', 'Wit' or 'Colour'. <BR>     But this is so much more than a book of smart remarks, it is a scrapbook of a lifetime of visual awareness. Decades must have whittled by as Fletcher was collecting all these fantastic stories, jotting down memories, cutting up newspapers, photocopying books, sketching fleeting visions and remembering good jokes.<BR>     Every double spread of the book is counted as one page, and each of these 532 'pages' are thoughtfully designed by Fletcher. Every anecdote, poem and thought is uniquely arranged with the typography, colour and layout carefully balancing the illustrations, doodles and photographs of which there are around 700. It is truly mindbending how much care and effort must have gone into this book, and it is this effort which makes it such a joy to read.<BR>     Through reading \\"Sideways\\" you also get to know a little about Alan Fletcher, to understand what kind of man it takes to complete such a generous and insightful offering of information. His brain must have been mightily relieved once it had poured out all this knowledge, and not a drop has been spilt. It is now up to us to absorb as much as we can, to learn from it and enjoy it. Those with even the smallest interest in the visual or the verbal will find it impossible to not appreciate and wonder at this book. Be careful carrying it home though.
0060920084|1.0|I am so disappointed with this book. Bryson comes off with an annoying and bitter adolescent attitude in this work. A week before I began reading The Lost Continent, I was lamenting about my nephew's 'blog. --The whole &quot;oh gee, I'm soooo much hipper than everyone else and I think I'll make fun of everyone in my writing to prove it.&quot; I see little difference between Bryson's book and my nephew's adolescent rantings.<BR>I don't have to have a happy ending or a happy book -- but Bryson is simply mean and shallow in his treatment of small town America.
B00006V9A0|4.0|Obviously excellent, but just a shame that every song on it except one has already been in my collection since the days of Nirvanas` reign! still a brilliant buy to prove to your kids that this band were one of the best ever!-(and to me they always will be)
B00002MZ4W|5.0|Beautiful record, from start to finish. Listen to it very carefully and youre going to have a wonderful experience.
B00007L4MJ|5.0|EXCELLENT! The BEST movie EVER made.<br />Been a Fritz Lang fan since was old enough to watch T.V.,and now own almost every movie made by him: but this is a classic that has stood the test of time.....the likes of &quot;Bladerunner&quot; are testiment to that!<br />Along with Sergei M. Einsteins` &quot;Battleship Potemkin&quot;, and Robert Wienes` &quot;Das Kabinett des Dr. Caligari&quot;- this movie is an outstanding piece of cinema that will continue to be the influence on modern moviemakers that it has been to date.<br />If you appreciate classic cinema, watch this movie!-(and read Thea von Harbous` book!)
B00008AY3L|4.0|While not his best release (Fight for Your Mind or Live from Mars get my votes), Diamonds on the Inside is still a great album.  Every song is a different style of music, ranging from Harper-esque acoustic, to reggae, to gospel-influenced, to orchestrated, to hard rock, to tribal sounding, to funk.  It's all there, and, for the most part, its really really good.  I only take issue with the lyrics on &quot;Bring the Funk.&quot;  I love funk music, but the lyrics on this one, to me at least, are him talking about writing a funk song.  That's fine, I mean, George Clinton comes to mind (&quot;We want the funk, we gotta have that funk...&quot;), but it's not what I was expecting from Harper, considering the lyrics on the majority of his other songs.  <br />The highlights for me: &quot;With My Own Two Hands,&quot; &quot;Amen Omen,&quot; and &quot;Blessed to be a Witness.&quot;  But the rest of the CD is good as well.
B000067CPX|5.0|this band just get better.<BR>some think they get worse as they \\"sell out\\"--but NO!<BR>this is excellent stuff, bought it for my son for easter....shoulda kept it for meself!
B000002LEU|5.0|This is the CD that introduced me to the sheer musical genius that is Joy Division.  I took my first tentative steps in the brooding, cold and loveless soundscapes after listening to the NIN version of Dead Souls on the Crow CD.  That was 10 years ago and I have been devoted to Joy Division / New Order / Electronic / Monaco etc ever since.<br />So makes this compilation such a transcendent work of genius.  Is it Peter Hook's low rumbling bass lines, Steven Smith's driving drums, Bernard Sumner's harsh punk guitar or Ian Curtis's emotionally charged lyrics? In truth all these elements are inseparable, they come together and give birth to what some reviewers have called the most frank and desolate picture of human loneliness ever committed to record.<br />So is Joy Division just a band for moody goth who want to spend their time dancing badly to Love Will Tear Us Apart? Well no. On this CD you'll find punk anthems like Transmission and Failure and the decidedly New Wave instrumental Atmospheres.<br />Joy Division is probably one of my favourite bands of all time and seeing New Order play Tranmission, New Dawn Fades and Love Will Tear us Apart on their Get Ready tour was truly one of the greates moments of my musical life.<br />If you are a fan of the post punk scene, goth, industrial or madchester this CD is a must own it truly captures the spirit, heart and soul of Curtis and his inner demons.
B00000J7JO|4.0|this is good Good GOOD!<BR>I`m on a par wi my son, in that we both love this, so there you go....a 15 yr old and a 34 yr old loving the same music!<BR>How much more proof do you need?
B000022TSW|5.0|I just finished watching this movie and I couldn't believe what I heard. This movie is DEFINITELY not for kids. Just for people who want a good laugh. I have to see it again and again because I never saw anything like it in all my life. I'm hooked on Cartman(he's the best) and I love Kenny. I hope they make a sequel.
B00005AQGJ|5.0|this album is dope period its probably pacs 2nd or 3rd best cd all the tracks are hot this is definitely a classic rap album if you dont even like pac that much you should still go cop this album then you will love him!
0783226063|3.0|I'm always been a great fan of DUne. When making a DUne movie, you have to make sure that it's well adapted to the book, otherwise it will come out mediocre.This movie wasn't too bad. It just cutted ou too much scenes. Acting was good. Visual effects were good. Sound was good. Costumes were [bad]. The Sardaukar look like ...firemen!! The Baron was too evil, with nasty zits all over his ... face! He acts like a total fool! And the heart plugs were a stupid addition, the Guild Navigator looks like a yellow .... Alia was too freaky and evil. Everything else was fine. The dialogue was exceptional.     <BR>        The story, based on the book, is about a special boy named Paul Atreides. His family si betrayed once he arrives on Dune, from the evil Harkonnens. He seeks for revenge, and finally battles the Sardaukar and the Harkonnen, winning a fremen girl. <BR>          George Lucas should had made this movie. If you want a great adaptation to the book, go with John Harrison's Dune miniseries. That one is a great one, or Children of DUne. THeir both great DUne Flicks.

B00008NG5V|5.0|This album isn't for everyone,  but for those who appreciate chill, laidback acoustic based music,  this album is incredible. It follows most of the same patterns as Jack's first album Brushfire Fairytales, but builds on that with some great results.  My only complaint is that my personal favorite song #5 Gone is very short.  I wish he had added another verse or something.  I saw that Rolling Stone only gave it 2 stars but I just can't see how that's possible, every song is great.  Just ignore that rating and buy the album,  put it in and mellow out like crazy.
0440237688|5.0|The Giver is hands down one of the best novels I've read. The 1994 Newbery Medal winning-book by Lois Lowry. The Newbery Medal honors the most outstanding contribution to children's literature published in the prior year. <br />The Giver provides fantasy with enough realism that you find yourself comparing things to the world we live in. The Giver is about Jonas, a child living in a particular community. In his community, individuals do not get to choose their own careers. You are observed throughout your schooling and required volunteer hours, and a job that fits your aptitudes is selected for you. So Jonas is looking forward to the ceremony where he receives his assignment, or job.<br />Jonas soon discovers that he has not received any ordinary job. He has been named as the new \\"Receiver of Memories.\\" Only one person has this job at any time, and the old one is ready to retire. Before the old one, whom Jonas comes to call \\"The Giver,\\" can retire, he must pass on all of his knowledge to Jonas. <br />Through the course of his job training, Jonas discovers that his society isn't all it's cracked up to be. The more he finds out about other societies, the more dissatisfied he becomes with his own. However, his society can only be changed in one way, and that way can be deadly. What does Jonas decide to do? You'll have to read and find out!<br />  The best thing about this book was the way it kept me on the edge of my seat from beginning to end. Wherever I thought the story was going, that's not where it went. New twists, turns, and ideas were found on every page of every chapter. Even things that are familiar to you will be seen from a new perspective.
B00004Z4WQ|3.0|This movie is a spoof of (mainly) 'I know what you did last summer' and 'Scream' (which was originally titled 'Scary Movie', by the way), with small references to other movies such as 'The Matrix', 'The Sixth Sense', etc.<br />Many of the jokes / situation were classic (my favorite was the 'Drew' scene, mimicking Drew Barrimore's famous creepy scene from 'Scream'). Others, on the other hand, were too gross and childish (at least to my not - too - picky taste).
B00005JKPF|4.0|I'm giving this movie four stars out of 5 within its genre.<br />X2: X-Men United is an unbelievble follow-up to what was just a mediocre first film.  It isn't often that sequels are superior to the first film - in this case it is definitely true.<br />The first film wasn't horrible, but as a fan of the comics, it was disappointing on several casting levels as well as the plotline and flow.<br />X2 makes none of the first film's errors:  it is action from the moment the movie starts and it ends the same way.  A new mutant has infiltrated the White House and threatens the President.  For those of us familiar with the comics, we know this mutant to be Nightcrawler, but to those unfamiliar, you find out eventually.  In fact, this film manages to step up not only the action and the pace, but integrates a love triangle very prominent in the comics, and effectively uses a few other new mutants.  We are introduced to a mutant of unbelievably strong psychic power (Legion in the comics?) and are able to witness a pre-mutant Hank McCoy (Beast) on television, while witnessing a list of mutants whose names many will recognize.  These are just a few of the things that are thrown out there for the comics fans.  Possibly the biggest thing thrown out there to us is in the final moments of the film.  I won't divulge it here, but suffice it to say that those who haven't read the comics may feel that something is lacking in the ending of the film....For those of us who know the comics, we'll eagerly await the next installment.<br />I'm not necessarily nuts about the \\"mutated\\" life lines assigned to our heros.  (i.e. Iceman is one of the original X-Men, but the movie makes him a much younger novice.)  I'm also not nuts about the original casting of Halle Berry as Storm - yes, she's gorgeous and now that she's got an Oscar she's more of a draw than before - BUT - Chris Claremont once said that Storm was modelled after the model/actress Iman, who is not only very much alive, but doesn't look much different than she did years ago - and she IS African as Storm is supposed to be).<br />.....<br />X2: X-Men United is a really great action film that will have you laughing and cheering and leaving the theater wanting more!look much different than she did years ago - and she IS African as Storm is supposed to be).<br />.....<br />X2: X-Men United is a really great action film that will have you laughing and cheering and leaving the theater wanting more!

I simply can't shake the images and as a result, I must label this some very \\"powerful writing.\\" Having experienced the death of loved ones (family members) this story and the young, murdered girl's take on heaven, allowed me to believe that my deceased relatives were still with me, and somehow taking care of my family and me. I loved this book.<br /><br />Michele Cozzens, Author of A Line Between Friends and The Things I Wish I'd Said.
B000060P79|4.0|I love this CD, Simple Plan is a great band. My favorite songs are &quot;I'd Do Anything&quot;, &quot;The Worst Day Ever&quot;, &quot;I'll Meet You There&quot;, &quot;Addicted&quot;, and the touching ballad &quot;Perfect&quot;. I can really relate to it, but it just gets old fast. But it's definetly worth a listen &amp; an add to your collection.
0790731983|5.0|This is a very good movie, although deeply disturbing. Set in the great city of Berlin in 1931, a time of economic depression and political crisis, this movie constructs an image of the decadence and delusion of the late Weimar period as German society is plunging through a kind of moral and social decay into the nightmare of Nazism.<br /> The film is based on \\"The Berlin Stories\\" by Christopher Isherwood (written between 1935 and 1939), who lived in the city in the early 1930s. He had seen both the decadence and the dangerous hunger for a kind of national \\"purification\\" among many \\"respectable\\" and \\"moral\\" middle class Germans, who already had been traumatized by military defeat, hyperinflation, and mass unemployment. The film, following Isherwood, weaves together the stories of the marginal characters who live in this troubled city at the very edge of the great moral catastrophe of the 20th century.<br /> Liza Minnelli is brilliant as \\"Sally Bowles\\", an Americanized version of the British Sally who appears in Isherwood's book, and her energy (and visible angst)drive the film as other characters wander aimlessly through a narrative heading all the time towards disaster. Michael York is effective as \\"Brian\\", the fictional stand-in for Isherwood himself, and the other characters present believable and even moving representations of people wandering through the impending nightmare as through a fog.<br /> The nightmare itself is suggested by the increasing visibility of the Brownshirts and the sinister swastika, the authentic posters and grafitti from the period, and the passing visual allusion to the street fights and storm troopers. These allusions effectively evoke the sense of uneasiness and danger in the air, an effect reinforced by Sally's deep desire to scream her heart out. The smug and complacent self-assurance of the conservative aristocrat Maximilien, played by Helmut Griem, provides a clue to the almost wilfull blindness of even (perhaps especially) educated Germans to the moral danger posed by the Nazi movement. The anti-Semitism of the movement is also effectively displayed from several angles, most movingly through the love story between Fritz and Natalia.<br /> But the strangest character is the Master of Ceremonies at the Kit Kat Klub, played brilliantly by Joel Grey. His character has a sinister ambiguity; is he mocking the Nazis by his farcical musical satires, or rather is he reinforcing the anti-Semitic prejudices of his audience through such pieces as, \\"If you could see her as I do . . .\\"? Is his decadence ignoring the danger and plunging his head like an ostrich into the sand, or is it a critical commentary on the pseudo-morality that worries about cabarets while ignoring Nazis? By the way, the entertainment at the movie Kit Kat Klub is first-rate (far, far better than the actual entertainment at the real Kit Kat cabaret, according to the later testimony of Isherwood, commenting on Liza Minnelli's performance). But this Bob Fosse-choreographed spectacle underlines both the brilliance and the moral danger of the cabaret.<br /> In historical fact, most Berliners were not Nazis; it was a largely working class town with strong Socialist and even Communist neighborhoods and a powerful left-wing tradition (which is why Hitler hated Berlin). But it was not immune to the Nazis. The Nazis themselves liked to contrast the supposed \\"healthy\\" vitality of a romanticized rural and small-town Germany against the decadence of urban Berlin, a point that is made in the film when young Nazi youth leaders at a beer garden lead an increasingly Nazified crowd to join in song celebrating nature and the volk. The film effectively plays out the irony of this contrast between a \\"moral\\" rural Germany increasingly drawn to the appeal of a profoundly immoral and murderous movement, and the \\"immoral\\" decadence of urban Berlin, many of whose cabaret performers would probably wind up in concentration camps within a few years. Hitler, after all, was big on public \\"morality.\\" It's just that this kind of \\"morality\\" didn't stop him from screaming hatred, fanning murderous resentments, murdering millions of Jews, and plunging Europe into the most catastrophic war in history. Cabaret performers, however otherwise decadent, could not be blamed for that. And decadent Brian even manages to get into a fist fight with some Nazi Brownshirts. <br /> This is a great film. It doesn't tell you what to think about the Emcee, or poor yearning but lively Sally, or even Brian himself. But whatever their tales, we know where the story is going. We know what those brownshirts and swastikas mean when we see them reflected in the glass at the end of the film. \\"Life is a Cabaret,\\" as Sally tells us in her climactic song, but even the best shows sometimes have the darkest endings.
B00000720W|5.0|This is quite possibly one of my favorite cds.<br />Maniac makes his debut here, and he had the only voice I have ever heard in the world of black metal that genuinely gave me chills when I first listened. His voice doesn't get to me quite as much these days, but he's still good.<br />Musically, Deathcrush consists of slower, simpler sounds, but this actually works very well for the band. The production is absolutely abysmal, as it was intended to be. As many people have said, the raw echoing effect fits the spirit of black metal perfectly.<br />I'm not going to sit here and say stupid things like \\"Cradle of Filth and Dimmu Borgir fans couldn't listen to *this* music\\", as I personally am a fan of both CoF *and* Dimmu Borgir. I know a good deal of fans of those two bands who are also interested in Mayhem (and Emperor, and Enthroned, and Nokturnal Mortum, and Burzum, and all those other bands the self-professed lords of all black metal have randomly dubbed \\"true\\").<br />This is very intense music made by some truly evil people (minus Hellhammer, who's actually quite a friendly fellow). It's chilling, it's dark, generally creepy and not-to-everyone's-taste. But that's what makes it great.
