B00AMBLXP8|4.0|Original and hilarious, if you love family guy you'll really like this movie it's definitely not for anyone under 16 but if you love family guy imagine a rated R version
B000VYNYN0|4.0|Totally worth it. Who can argue with this price considering the quality of this film and the legends it built? I definitely reccommend the blu-ray version
B009MCRHH6|5.0|This is quite the addictive and fun game. Really glad I took a chance on it and thank you to Amazon for making it free. I got it today on my kindle fire HE an  it loads an  performs perfect. Great game!
B005J9ZE5I|4.0|This movie was/is a thing of beauty. Everyone has heard of these movies. Theyve been talked about for years. You wont find another like this besides the first Evil Dead obviously.
B006CQLGXG|5.0|I liked how the book and author brought out the true feeling of Christmas in every stave. It brings cheer and excitement
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|Seth MacFarlane is a hilarious comedian. I love \\"Family Guy\\" and I feel the same way about the movie \\"Ted\\" (shortened name for a existent teddy bear). I like the scene in which Ted had...with his girlfriend. He also had to deal with a psychotic and kidnapping father and son wanting to control and abuse him. Overall, the movie is worth seeing. I would not mind viewing an encore.
B000059QY3|5.0|I lent my copy to two associates who haven't yet accepted opera as a first choice.  After watchiing La Traviata, we added their names to the enthusiastic list.  One plans to drive to the City just t experience the opera house at Lincoln Center.<br /><br />For me,  There is not a note in the whole opera that I don't know' it is so familiar and soul satisfying.  When my copy is returned, I shall listen to it yet and yet again.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|The trilogy is fantastic and fun to immerse yourself in.  Thanks for the entertainment and the glimpse into a world or lifestyle of possibilities.
0316232955|3.0|I'd like to start off by saying that I believe Chris Colfer is immensely talented and I consider myself a fan of his, but I have many issues with his writing. I had seen the movie before reading this book, and I really enjoyed it, so I honestly thought I would like the book just as much. The problem is -and this is something I didn't like about The Land Of Stories as well- that despite the promising feel of the story, Colfer's writing feels rigid and the characters are often one-dimentional, not to mention the author's annoying habit of always explaining exactly what is going on in the main character's head, without leaving anything for the readers to understand on their own.<br />I didn't have issues with Carson's character per se, I fully understand his anger and frustration and -yes- he's a jerk, but he can also be funny as hell. What I didn't like about him was the constant whining, which made the whole story feel like one big angry monologue rather than an actual journal. I would have loved for the book to go deeper into his relationship with his mom, which was one of the best parts of the movie. I wasn't that bothered by the ending, because I knew exactly what was going to happen, but I understand how an unknowing reader could have seen it as an easy, rushed shocker.<br />Overall, I would not recommend the book. Once again, the concept is brilliant (and well developed in the movie), there are many hilarious jokes, but the book is just badly written. I struggle to believe it would have been published if the author were unknown. I'm confident that with better editing and more experience, though, Colfer will become an amazing storyteller.
B008FYZIVY|4.0|I really enjoyed watching the series on Public Television.  I missed a few episodes, and got interupted on a few more,so I decided to buy the series. Public Television had it for $120.00, and everwhere else I checked was also to expensive for me.  I bought this on Amazon, as a gold box  special for under $30.00,and was thrilled!!!  It is one of my favorite Christmas presents.  Thank you Amazon, Grandma
B004UID2LC|4.0|I really like it alot. Wonderful app for my Kindle. The video have to download but the video looks and sound superb! I'm a YouTube fan. Thanks to my Kindle and Steph.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I chose Solitaire because it is easy to play, takes only a little time. Also this is a different version<br />than I usually see. Try it. It will not raise your blood pressure.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|Sometimes you just need a movie that you know will have a happy ending, it's really nice when the journey to the ending is so captivating and fresh.  It made me feel that perhaps I would like to retire to India when I'm older.  I love the parallel love stories, the recognition that life, love, and passion doesn't not end in middle age.  Definitely would watch again.
B004SRPXWQ|3.0|Does not work on Kindle Fire so I was disappointed, but since it was free I will not complain.  My sister-in-law had it and I liked it but since does not work on the Kindle Fire, guess that is life.
B0035FQ1UU|1.0|The apocalypse could not have came sooner. I would have been better off dieing by zombies or killer robots than see this movie.
B00AH8U3UC|3.0|A fun series still, but this season's scripts and story arc didn't captivate the attention as previous seasons had. If another season is in the works, I hope the series's freshness and pizzazz can be restored.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Rick Riordan is the best author ever, I would recommend this book to everyone. I CAN'T WAIT UNTIL THE HOUSE OF HADES COMES OUT
B001BKVWYG|3.0|This CD is very good especially when you consider when it was recorded.  Why this CD went no where is, indeed, curious.  He could have given Dylan a run for his money.
0143113100|5.0|I just finished reading \\"The Brain that Changes Itself\\". It is an excellent book for those interested in human neurology, psychology, philosophy, and ethics. The book offers an optimistic outlook on how greatly the human brain is subject to modification, restructuring, and transformation through learning new methods of thinking and behaving.<br /><br />Brain plasticity, which is what this book is about, provides insights into how new pathways and new structures, as well as considerable reorienting of the brain - even into advanced years - can be achieved. Exercising the desired areas of the brain can lead, through the means of brain plasticity, to very considerable mental, emotional, and spiritual modification of the psyche.<br /><br />This is the most enlightening and optimistic book I have yet read on human neurology or psychology. I would highly recommend it for anyone who has a mental or physical disability, or cares about someone who is so afflicted. The doors to relearning and restructuring of the psyche are almost endless, so long as life and motivation to improve prevail. From my own perspective, this book is highly recommended.
B000068FY0|5.0|I think this is Supertramp's best CD,without a doubt and it deserves a five star rating more than their other CD S'.
B009RI4FRU|3.0|I guess I didn't get the warm fuzzy feeling about this movie. I was really looking forward to seeing it. It was sweet & a bit weird.<br />I think it was supposed to be artist, For that I give it 1 thumb up
B0018QOIXU|4.0|This was a Christmas gift to my daughter, she very much liked it and was her first Adele CD. Great music on the CD.
B00AF6MF9I|3.0|My major bitch in this game is you can't upgrade the buildings you have to expand the  area which costs way to much . But other then that it's a ok waste if time
B008ELUEQC|5.0|Oh, wow, what can you say? It's Rod Stewart, such a sexy man, his music is great, and his Christmas songs are even greater.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|get this app it is really good and show the correct time but i wish u could change the  color
B006FLGBGA|5.0|Great addition to the series. Intelligent storyline and direction.  Love James Franco and John Lithgow.  Hope they make a sequel.
B005HSG3U6|2.0|This is not what I wanted and rated it accordingly.  I wanted one that would be able to stand up, hands free this doesn't do at all. But it says if you open package you can't return. Very disappointed in this product.
B0095ZMMCK|3.0|There's no doubt that Clancy can still churn out international clashes of powerful nations.  Here, the now aged John Clark has to be called back into the fray to make a special ops team function right, after a number of the good guys are killed by Chinese agents of the top of Communist Party, who meets his fate, finally.  All the old actors, including Mary Pat Foley are resurrected for Clancy afficianados, and Jack Ryan (Jr.) is being primed for future stardom in a movie sequel.  The techno-speak for computer geeks will attract those who fear international control of computer networks, or are sure that there are armies of programmers hidden in some underground lab, with walls of Coke cans surrounding their cubicles.  They never see the daylight, but are all aware of everything that is passed electronically.
0345803485|5.0|I got my order quickly and read it so fast I was able to start the second within the same week.
B0076DELIG|3.0|I always look forward to reading another Harry Bosch novel by Michael, but I found this one to be a bit of a &#34;changer.&#34;  Harry's recognition that his own persistence and obsession with justice carries consequences shows more nuances than prior hard-charging action.  That's not to say it wasn't worth the read, but don't expect some of the same intriguing turns and page-turning impulses.  It must have taken me at least two days to read, and I usually finish these in a single sitting.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Another great Harry Bosch novel.....I'm waiting for the next one!  Michael Connelly is one of my favorite authors.  Love his character development
0743270754|5.0|I could not put this book down. The audio version was brilliant as well. I KNOW once you start it, you won't want it to end!
B004J4WKUQ|4.0|Having heard about this book through word of mouth I was eager to see for myself what all the talk was about. I gotta say, I liked this book more than I thought I would. The characters are likable and the pacing is spot on. I blew through this book in a couple days, its a real page turner. Sometimes the author is rather heavy handed with the references (meme city up in herrr) but otherwise no complaints. Great book can't wait to read more from this author!
B005KR6OBM|5.0|My daughter got me started warching this show and asked for this for Christmas.  Also got her a rock paper scissors lizard spock shirt to go along with the dvds
B009HEJXFS|3.0|Entertaining.  Not groundbreaking but enjoyable.  It's more like 1 than 2, but with more Will Smith and less Tommy Lee Jones.  And no Vincent Donofrio :-).
B001LF3YQK|5.0|Easy slide for access of wipes<br />Can contain a good amount of wipes<br />Wipes stay wet/ doesn't dry out<br />Overall a great product..
B008QTVNUI|5.0|We did a marathon viewing of season 1 and can't wait for the second season to become available via Amazon. Simply terrific!
0316187216|5.0|I don't often give books a five star rating, but I really did enjoy every aspect of this book. Right from the start I found Shy interesting and enjoyable to read about.  I found Temple pretty easy to like as well. These two are the main characters, and while occasionally the perspective shifts to a supporting character, it is mainly their story.  This book has themes exploring cowardice and bravery, and wishing to be a better person.<br /><br />I know many people were surprised and put off by the Western theme of this particular book. Given the popularity of Firefly (a western space opera), I'm a little surprised by that reaction.<br /><br />He does an excellent job giving the entire story a very western feel. It is a standalone like all the other books aside from his trilogy, but I really do strongly recommend reading everything in order. There are returning characters from previous books, and I just have a feeling the enjoyment would be lessened a great deal if one isn't familiar with them.<br /><br />I had been excited to read another book that promised to feature Cosca prominently, because I really enjoyed him in Best Served Cold. Cosca is not as prominent in this particular book, and he's decidedly less likable. If you don't want to be spoiled, I would actually stop reading my review right about here. Okay. Have you stopped? Seriously. Stop now. I'm going to talk more about Cosca. So, it turns out he's basically the villain in this book. One of them. I suppose there are a few, but I'd consider him the main antagonist, despite Shy's mission to find her missing brother and sister.  Cosca's characterization still didn't bother me, because it seemed like a fairly natural progression from where he left off.  I had to keep in mind that Best Served Cold was from the point of view of a character who Cosca actually cared about, seemed like a daughter to him, in fact.  Of course I would not be seeing that side of him in this particular installment.<br /><br />Out of allof Abercrombie's books, this one had the least dark ending. It's very mixed, like his previous books, but there's more hope in this one than in most of the others. This is the only one of his books that had a romantic relationship in it that wasn't incredibly unhealthy. It was kind of refreshing. As much as I appreciate authors that do portray BAD relationships, which are underrepresented in fantasy despite being exceedingly common in real life, it was nice seeing the opposite for a change. An author praised for his realism must realize that in real life, sometimes people DO stay together, of course.<br /><br />I appreciated seeing the loose ends tied up. I was waiting for Shivers to reappear, as he was an obvious gun on the wall, and I honestly was not expecting the outcome that occurred there.<br /><br />The one thing I didn't figure out, and maybe I wasn't meant to and it's intended to be revealed in a later book, was the identity of the Mayor of Crease. I know she had a history with Cosca, and did not use her name. I couldn't place her with any of the female characters from the previous books, and it was driving me crazy.<br /><br />The very end was pretty much the perfect, classic ending for a western. I was thoroughly satisfied by this book, and cannot think of a single complaint.
B004WR125O|5.0|THIS IS THE EASIEST PRODUCT TO USE FOR MULTI PURPOSE FUNCTIONS OF THE ONKYO'S WEB APP'S<br />AS WELL AS IT'S OWN APP'S.<br />  AN AWESOME AND TINY LITTLE COMPANION TO MY ENTIRE HOME NETWORK OF MEDIA
B004YM6JI2|5.0|I very much appreciated the quick delivery of this package and the great shape it was in when it arrived. I have all 6 seasons of this fantastic show and couldn't fathom not completing the collection! A great season and a worthwhile gift that I intend to enjoy immensely. I recommend any and all to start this thrilling series. Scary, funny, emotional, and about the strength of family, you'll be hooked instantly!
B007TK77QE|2.0|This book was very negative, not a lot of good stuff going on.  It was quite tedious to read but I kept going because I thought it would get better but I was sadly disappointed.  Don't think I will be reading any more books by JK Rowling.  I think she should stick to writing children's books, they were much more fun.
B000FVQLQQ|5.0|My brother loved this movie the day he viewed it a year ago. When he told me this is what he wanted for Christmas, I knew to look no where else but at Amazon! The delivery of the film was quick and efficient, and I can tell you he's already viewed three times and doesn't intend to stop anytime soon. Fantastic film!
B00288KNJU|2.0|Creepy movie. And be careful showing to kids. Has two grandmas basically naked and dancing. Very disturbing. Never have liked Tim Burton movies, so maybe if you're a fan of his work you'll like this.
B00A4YVHXQ|5.0|I got this app as a freebee for the day. I thought it sounded cool and I figured my grandkids would enjoy it. Once I opened it I found this 60 year old man was having a ball with it. having no musical ability, I have to stick with the easy song. But who knows, with a little practice????  We will have to wait to see what the kids think but I like it!
B00AMBLDEE|5.0|Great action and drama as with the othr movies. Kinda left you wanting more closure. Guess another ones coming, not a bad thing.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is an outstanding trilogy! I highly recommend it for people who love to read. I can't wait to see the movies
B0036EH3UC|5.0|I missed this series when it first came on television.  The complete set is the way to rectify that mistake.  It has everything you'd want if science fiction is your thing.  My family and I loved it.<br /><br />Don't buy extra DVDs for related features until you examine the contents carefully.  I found this set already contains additional material I had intended to buy.
B00170DEM8|5.0|A great old movie and the prequel to White Christmas. It's funny with a touch of comic suspense. This movie is a family classic.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|Season 3 doesn't disappoint.  If you are a fan of this series, you know not to get overly attached to any of the characters.  Season 3 has brought us some great new ones.  I'm addicted!
B001TCHDPS|5.0|First heard rodriguez in the 70's when i was in my late teens. Had a compilation tape of the two records. Loved it.<br />Recently saw the movie &#34;Searching for Sugarman&#34; , an inspiring film. His undaunted spirit and  inner peace despite  having  is undoubted talents ignored was amazing. Ordered the CD's and have been flogging them since. Everytime i hear &#34;Cause&#34;  i still get shivers up my spine. Great song!!!
B002HJ9PTO|5.0|Used this instead of the popular RadioShack 33-3013 for micing upright bass. Works great. The on off switch is great and the cord is long.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|Have written a comment for &#34;oming from Reality &#34; that is just as relevant for this album.  The man is an undeniable talent. It is good to see that he is getting some recognition.
B001DPHDCY|5.0|Horton Hears a Who DVD was for my granddaughter. This is a new item and the best part is...the price was perfect.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|best game ever. has a lot of games there very easy but some are very challenging. but great for kids and adults.
B00AMBK6J2|5.0|This movie is so funny & cute & raunchy, aa at the same time. One of our favorite movies !
B0011E7JBW|5.0|Hard to top the other two but they did a great job with this one.  But I think this should be it.
B004LWZWGK|1.0|This movie is absolutely horrible! Being a fan since Adam West and Burt Ward I have seen various re-telling of the epic Batman story, thinking that none could get worse than Batman Forever. Man was I ever wrong. This story makes no sense in the scheme of Batman, it flips all over the place trying to appeal to, honestly I don't know what kind of audience this new series of Batman is trying to appeal to. The characters are completely off of who they are supposed be, the story line is desperate, the attempt at a shock factor is pathetic, and half the time I couldn't understand the words Bane spoke. I'm sure one day I will be saying the same thing again with this movie \\"just when I thought Batman couldn't get worse...\\"
B001GQ2TGA|5.0|This Enya cd is wonderful.  My favorite is the little toy soldier, but love all the music on this cd.  Her voice is so beautiful, I keep it in my car to enjoy while driving.
B005H29GSI|2.0|My family loves the Angry Birds apps, so I decided to buy a couple of these angry birds games for the kids for christmas.  Big mistake.  The blocks are only have 4 solid sides the other 2 sides are hollow, this makes it extremely difficult to build the structures which one is supposed to knock down.  The real challenge in this game is building the tower that your opponent is supposed to knock down.  Once you finally build the structure for you kids, they have to try to hit it with the birds.  The catapult shoots the birds too far up, and not far enough forward.  We have been lucky to hit the tower with 1 in 5 shots.  The birds fly different distances and directions on every shot.  We have had to modify the rules, as another poster stated, allowing the kids to shoot each set of birds 3 times.  With that mod, we can sometimes knock down the tower.  In spite of the horrible quality of this game we have been able to have bit of fun - playing together.  We have had much more fun playing other games, and I don't think these Angry Birds games will be in the rotation for very long.  If it weren't for our love of the Angry Birds Apps I don't think these games would have lasted 10 minutes before being retired.  They are affordable, and may provide toys for other imaginative play, however the game (as intended) was very poorly executed.
B00992CF6W|4.0|Needs some of the other things that the pc and Xbox have like maps and other control settings having trouble connecting with friends and would prefer to be able to change between survival and creative without having to make different worlds for the different  modes still early in update once it updates it could be just as popular and fun as the other versions
B0031R5K68|3.0|Its a complicated book. Its definitely not a holiday read.<br /><br />There are many loop holes many stuff defy logic.<br /><br />You realise half way through the real identity of the villain then its not so  much a interesting read anymore.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|I had heard about the negative reviews of this movie and that is why it took me so long to get around to watching it.<br />I think the negative reviews might have been a little too harsh, but that may be somewhat due to seeing it on my tv versus in the theater.<br /><br />Basically, the sound quality isn't as good on my tv as in the theater, so the booming of Bane's voice wasn't pronounced, so it just more like an adaptation of Razaoul Ghuul's (sp), which it turns out was intended.<br /><br />I am pleased with the series as a whole, and I like the real-world implications that they wrestled with if Batman were real - the mounting injuries and inability to do the mission. Likewise, his successor was perfectly fit into the role. I look forward to the next installment, whomever the director may be.
B0039TAHMA|3.0|When I watched this film in high school, I enchanted by the visuals effects.  And then the comeback of trilogies or a film narrative spread among 3 films, was so interesting.<br /><br />But after reading and watching Game of Thrones. I am a little bored by this trite narrative.  And the film is a little sausage intensive.  There were opportunities to expand female characters, the film didn't try.  I wish it were more realistic of the fantasy period.<br /><br />I think it's weird that someone's head can be chopped off, blown to bits, but romantic encounters reduced to glances or pecks.<br /><br />Feel like I'm living in some middle school boy's fantasy world. Before he knows how to relate to women better.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I like this match three because it has a story line.  Nothing spectacular but a fun little path to follow.
B002WV5A9G|4.0|It's a good action flick with use of special effects nicely woven in.  I think Chris Pine isn't my favorite choice.  He comes off a someone Michael Bay would cast.  Female roles were great, passed the Bechdel test.<br /><br />I felt that when it was 20 minutes left of the movie, that the movie was halfway done.  It could have been longer with more action.
0525952616|4.0|fast paced. A peek into a possible near future. without being too &#34;preachy&#34; the author brings to light issues surrounding drone warfare. The answer to how much of the tech is just around the corner I leave to those involved in drone development. I hope it's far off because we are clearly not ready for this.
B00AGH6FD8|5.0|When I watch this film, I feel like a kid again.  I laughed out loud.  And usually when I watching a film,I am sitting there being cynical about how unrealistic, or how the storyline is forced.  But this film feels like visiting Disneyland. :D
B001F12J48|1.0|This is a color shift 3D for a standard TV looks like CRAP, DON'T make the same mistake I did assuming it is for a tru 3D TV, this is a marketing rip off of 3D INHO.......
B004C3DLJS|5.0|I can rewatch this film, again and again.  There are so many levels to this film.  The plot and character development is superb.  This beats a majority of the non-animated films that are produced each year.
B005HSL626|5.0|My kids and I absolutely love this game!! It is very addicting and competitive.  We have competitions against each other and they are beating me!!
B002NWOOXW|5.0|I consider this film does to the Bridget Jones genre as what Mindy Kaling is doing to sitcoms today.  This film is incredibly refreshing with the internal dialogue that women of a certain generation can relate to. I watched this in middle school and now as an adult I have a whole new appreciation for it.  I can't wait for the third one to come out.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|I am 62 and loved it! Hopefully, I never get too old to appreciate entertainment that puts a smile on my face and a tear to my eye.
0061339202|5.0|I got this book because it talked about consciousness and it's relationship to happiness.  It's a heavy read, like reading 20 pages takes 2 hours. But each chapter feels like a class at Berkeley.  Top five best books that changed my  view on my role in the world.
B008BGNMZU|5.0|Fourplay continues to deliver a very satisfying performance as they have down through the years. Many more should discover and enjoy their music
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Both me and my daughter enjoy this game.  Nice clean fun.  Works great on my Kindle HD.  It's also very addictive
B0086700CM|5.0|I would probably pay 1.99 for this game.<br />I am not sure why everyone says it lags on the kindle<br />because it doesn't for me.<br />Definitely not complaining since its free.
B00130UFY2|3.0|This movie is basically a non stop chase scene.  This actually gets very boring.  I was going to watch the whole series but now will not.  In addition, the movie did now feed well, having frequent breaks.  This is not a problem when I get films from netflix, so I don't think the problem is with my equipment.
B00A9V2JSG|5.0|Once again I'm left impressed and wanting more from a Lauren Oliver book.<br /><br />I absolutely loved the concept of Delirium and I can't wait to read the next two books in the series.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Bought this app looking for a new time killer. I haven't been able to stop playing it for days now. This is a must have for everyone.
1400069289|5.0|This is a really well-researched book that provides tons of insight into the nuances of thought and decision making. Filled with real-life examples and careful commentary, Duhigg's book surpasses all other books on willpower written in recent years.<br /><br />The book provides valuable analysis about people, what they do and why they do it. It provides a clearly laid-out strategy, too, to help us potentially change the ways we function and operate in a world in which we are totally overwhelmed by stimuli at all corners.<br /><br />I think this book has made me a better shopper, athlete and even a better thinker. A must-read for all.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|This book is a great book. It makes you want to keep reading it. I couldn't put it down,it was that good that you want more.
B0016MJ6HY|4.0|My girlfriend who is beautiful that i will one day marry really likes this movie. So i got it for her and we watched it together. It's long, drawn out and slightly confusing. It basically boils down to the idea where a girl, played by Norah Jones, is cheated on so she ends up in a coffee shop owned and ran by the irresistible- Jude Law. The whole of the movie is of Norah running around,  trying to find herself and meeting people who are worse off than she. In the end she returns to Jude and realizes she never should have left......it took her a year to figure this out.
B003VANOFY|4.0|I bought this product on black friday by coincidence.<br />I was looking for Astro a50 but when g930 dropped to 69.99$ i couldn't resist myself.<br />Everyday when Im playing or listening music, i'm very satisfied with the quality.<br />I don't want to write a novel for this product so i'll skip to pros and cons.<br />Pros:<br />Good 7.1<br />Wireless is the best!<br />Comfortable<br />Cons:<br />Mic. This mic make you sound like a girl.<br />Too hard to plug charge cable to the headset and removal.<br /><br />But i'm satisfied with the headset, it is the best in the headsets i've used (steelseries 5hv2, g330, razor chimaera, g35, creative fatalitymk2.)
0761169253|4.0|A fun, inspiring little book, jam-packed with good ideas and relevant quotes to help spur your creative potential. Worthwhile reading.
B0089M0DGM|4.0|I bought this purely on a whim and it's actually pretty good. A big show! Was never a big fan or knew much of their music but I do remember one tune from MTV - Edicott. Unfortunately and much to my surprise, this song is not on here...Video quality is not bad and is acceptable for the 80's.
1401235417|5.0|I've just recently been getting into comic books and the New 52 was a great time to jump in.  I can say without a doubt that The Court of the Owls has been a fantastic ride so far.<br />Normally I breeze through comics paying attention to the story and the art and enjoying things but with this particular book I found myself reading everything more slowly and looking at the art panel for panel instead of just glancing at the work on the whole page and going to the next.<br />This book took me longer to go through than other larger collections because I was so fascinated by the story that I wanted to savor it.<br />You cannot go wrong by picking this up even if you aren't a Bats fan
B007FG9LIE|3.0|I was intrigued by the fantastic reviews, Pines is definitely a creepy read. Inspired by one of my favorite TV shows, Twin Peaks, Pines attempts to capture the story of human spirit against a sci-fi experiment. I think the writer has promise however I found no novelty in the plot.
B001P5M7QE|5.0|I love it. It made me laugh and think. I love English humor. If I am not dead yet, I will watch it again.
B00AGDVWDK|5.0|A delightful movie.  My younger kids were charmed by the infectious good nature of the lead played by Cary Grant.  My fourteen year old snickered a little at the 1947 special effects, but he like the movie anyway.<br /><br />Me, I liked the unashamedly positive portrayal of Christianity, Christmas, and marriage.
B00AMBK0X4|4.0|It was was less obscene than I thought. Acting was good and funny but it was 10 mins too long.
B0018QCXGY|5.0|The movie is diffrent from many with the camera being carried by one of the character's during the event. It his fast paced and suspenseful.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|i dont have  anything too bad tp say about this game  though  alot of the minis seemed rushed and kinda dumb. havent played it much though
B00AA7O6QC|1.0|I like almost all movies...but this one falls so low on the dreadful waste of time and life scale it's not funny.  Speaking of not funny, this movie certainly wasn't.  There was just a lot of blowing people up and an all star cast of once great action actors who had no storyline or plot worth having to work with.  My husband wanted to turn it off halfway through but since I had paid to rent it I wouldn't let him.  But advice for others...even if this was available for free don't bother.
B000IHY9SE|4.0|1.Shady Narcotics [Intro]-2/10 Bad intro...<br />2.We're Back-Eminem,Obie Trice,Stat Quo,Bobby Creekwater,Cashis] 7.5/10 Good song,but not the best track on here.<br />3.Pistol Pistol REMIX-Obie Trice 8/10 Re make of the old D12 song \\"Pistol Pistol\\" from Devil's Night. This is a good version,but I think the original from Devil's Night by D12 was better.<br />4.Murder-Bizzare FT.Kuniva 6/10 Not very good. It's just not that original. Bizzare gets old,because you heard all of his bullcrap before if you have listened to D12. Kuniva did OK. Not that good.<br />5.Everything Is Shady-Cashis 7.5/10 Decent song,alot better than the last track we just heard.<br />6.The Re Up-Eminem FT.50 Cent 9/10 Great song. I really like this song,it's not the best on this album...but it's VERY good.<br />7.You Don't Know-Eminem FT.50 Cent,Cashis,Lloyd Banks 9.5/10 One of the best songs on this album. I love this song. Everyone did good on this song.<br />8.Jimmy Crack Corn 7.5/10 Good song,but it kinda gets annoying after a while. But I remember when I first got this album I listened to this track like 8 times a day.<br />9.Trapped (Snippet)-Proof 10/10 Love this song,but it ticks me off that Eminem shortened this track.<br />10.Whatever You Want-Swifty Mcvay FT.Mr.Porter-7/10 OK song,but I heard a lot of stuff like this on Devil's Night by D12. But this is still a OK song.<br />11.Talkin' All That-7/10 OK song,nothing special. Not as good as Whatever You Want.<br />12.By My Side-Stat Quo-9/10 SO MUCH BETTER THAN TALKIN' ALL THAT. I like this song.<br />13.We Ride For Shady-Obie Trice FT.Cashis-7.5/10 OK song,not anything close to amazing or perfect...but this is OK.<br />14.There He Is-Bobby Creekwater-8/10 It does seem like they didn't give a single crap about Bobby Creekwater,as he was barely on this album. But this is a good song.<br />15.Tryin' To Win-Stat Quo-9/10 Good song. I like it.<br />16.Smack That REMIX-Akon FT.Stat Quo,Bobby Creekwater-9.5/10 Not as good as Smack that ORIGINAL on akon's album Konvicted,but this is good.<br />17.Public Enemy #1-Eminem 4/10 Wow,first time Eminem's on this album in a while,and this is what it is. Worst song on the album.<br />18.Get Low-Stat Quo 6.5/10 So much better than the original off the get rich or die trying sound track.<br />19.Ski Mask Way REMIX-50 Cent 8/10 Better than the original,but nothing super great.<br />20.Shake That-Eminem FT.Bobby Creekwater,Nate Dogg,Obie Trice 7.5/10 OK,but not as good as the original off of Eminem's album curtain call:The Hits.<br />21.Cry Now (Shady Remix)-Obie Trice FT.Kuniva,Bobby Creekwater,Cashis,Stat Quo-8.5/10 Good,but the original is WAAAY better.<br />22.No Apologies-Eminem-10/10 I think this is actually the best full song on the album. Love it. So yeah,thanks for reading my review! :)
B00AF6MF9I|3.0|The only thing that I don't like about the game is that it makes you spend your free special gold medals. I thing it is a little slow but it dose make you thing about your next move.
078401213X|4.0|I bought this after seeing it at the movies. It was good, but kind of fell apart at the end. It was unfortunate, because the premise of the story is good. It unfortunately devolves into the ridiculous. The soundtrack is kind of catchy, which is half the reason I got into it.
B00AMBH70S|5.0|I thought the movie was great,  the wife commented about some of the action scenes as being impossible and way out there and I agreed, but I reminded her that it is just a movie and made to entertain not be factual. The govt. scenes reminded me of just how slimy ours has become. Over all great
B00AMBK6J2|3.0|Ted was an original idea and funny in parts. I loved all of the pop culture references and the witty dialogue.
B001UV4XFG|4.0|My nice reallyy like this movie . , the fighting scene﻿ is very impressive and it good movie for teenagers too
B00A8ECU24|4.0|pretty good game. haven't gotten very far. wish you didn't need real money to progress. good graphics too. that really surprised me about it.
B009NPA3Q4|3.0|I can tell he likes Dave Matthews because he sounds like him on some of his songs.  I rate an album high when I like every song or almost every song.  I didn't with this one.
B008G8SFGO|5.0|To make sure I am a true KISS fan I know I must keep up-to-date with all their songs, and having this makes me feel sure that I am.
B008NW67E0|4.0|You have to enjoy folk music to like this album, which I do.  I hope to see them in concert soon.
B008GOAFBQ|5.0|To have this anniversary edition of Destroyer made me so happy and I look forward to listening to it every day
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is super super cool! !!!!  great for fun.. I hope u enjoy too. I luv this game.  good luck.
B000U0F7RG|5.0|This series could not be more enjoyable.....the packaging is absolutely adorable.  I feel like a little kid, I am so happy!!  A great Christmas gift :-)
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|This was a great story.  I liked her book Slammed but this was much better.  Better character development and plot.  I still think Holder is way too good to be true, but we all can dream!
B0053O89RY|5.0|OMG this is one of the all-time funniest shows!!  No matter how down in the dumps you may be feeling, this show will make you LOL!
B00APUQH0W|3.0|The movie was okay. It was a little slow and cheesy, but overall I enjoyed it. Clint Eastwood was classic Clint Eastwood. They could have cut and pasted most of his lines from Gran Torino.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|I can not wait for Season 2 to be offered on DVD so I can watch it.....since it is on Showtime, I dont get to see it that way.  Absolutely amazing story, acting, etc.  And it is Pres. Obama's fav show!
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|I thought it was a very entertaining book. A great children's novel and series. I gave it a 4 star book also for its great cartoon illustrations.
B00006FDCD|5.0|I have watched this movie at least a half dozen times and will watch it again and again.  It is a really great story, scary, etc.
B0002Y4TOM|5.0|I choose this for my granddaughters birthday gift among other things.  She is 22 and loves this series.  A good choice and so happy Amazon has these, so I don't have to leave the house and can shop from home...Thanks Amazon, Mary Speer
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|This mouse simple blew me away. You can customize it in so many different way. Feels great in your hand not only for gamers but for the average computer user. The blue neon's on this mouse makes it stand out from all the others and has the nice Anker logo on it. out of all the mice i have use this one is by far the best one on out there. Of you are considering getting this,  consider no more and buy!
B005LAJ17M|3.0|Not as much action as I had hoped. I enjoyed 24 much better. I might try the second season but right now it's still pretty pricey.
B005HS4CUY|1.0|The Toy Story 3 Bluray comes only with english and french (dubbed and subtitled), but not spanish like the other discs… <br /><br />I saw the picture of the bos, where it says that in US comes with spanish/english tracks, and in Canada comes with french/english; but I assumed that this is the US version of the disc…
B0067EKY7M|1.0|I watched this on a flight to Portland. I was excited because I love fish, and it takes place in a foreign country, Yemen. That said, this story has a lot of problems. The pacing is slow, the romantic relationships and hardships seem forced, predictable, and dull (no fireworks or chemistry or compelling needs here--these people just happen to be near each other during life changes so the audience can see their kissing scenes coming from miles away). Potentially the most interesting character, the sheik, has been turned into a \\"Magical Black Man\\" who facilitates this romance in between mystical quasi-religious quips pertaining to Life, Fish, and God. There are some Bad Guys who are angry with him for building a dam for his fish, and they make many attempts on the sheik's life worthy of Wile E. Coyote, succeeding or failing as the plot requires. This means out everyman Ewan gets to save the Sheik's life and tragedy can befall when the plot demands a climax so viewers can walk away feeling like SOMETHING happened in this movie.<br /><br />Ewan plays a curmudgeonly wildlife steward who loves fish. He's that guy at work where whenever you have a cool new project or want to try a different methodology, he starts whining like an old combustion engine. \\"No no no, we can't do that because I fear change!\\" His love interest seems like an elegant, ambitious young woman with many prospects ahead of her, which makes me wonder: WHY DOES THIS GUY APPEAL TO HER? Oh, right, the writers needed something to put some meat on the plot.<br /><br />In the end there is just too much woo-woo and the real interesting parts of this movie are not explored:<br />-The life cycle and history of salmon, the collapse of their wild stock<br />-Why the Bad Guys were so upset with the Sheik--I still have no idea why they were upset, and I never got the impression the sheik did either.<br />-Why our hero's love life fell apart--other than \\"because.\\"<br />-How that disaster helped him stop being such a curmudgeon and grow into a better person.<br /><br />I suppose this movie is supposed to his journey to a less curmudgeonly state, but I never got that impression. He's just being kicked from one life change to a new project and, oh, hey, hot chick and spiritual solace. In that sense, the other characters aren't real characters at all so much as magical archetypes on his life journey, and I absolutely detest this sort of storytelling.<br /><br />This movie reeked of British Imperialism and Disney-esque marginalization of real world problems. Blegh.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|i think this app works very well! i like a lot, and i really love how it shows the last equation you did.
B009LXEBD4|5.0|By far the best idol ever. It had all the songs you know and love.  You won't want to stop playing it.
B000FC1MM8|5.0|I keep thinking this is the best book I've read of Michael Connelly.... then I read this one.. Loved it! Can't wait till bedtime to open it up and read..Suspense. I just look forward to the next book I pick up of his.. Thanks
B002BWP49M|4.0|Loved this movie!! Was the best of the series until Part 2...will buy that one as well to complete my collection :-)
B000JQU1VS|5.0|Sir Arthur Conan Doyle wrote many good, intellectual books and I think this is one of them. I recommend it to anyone willing to read it.
B006O6F932|3.0|This was a must have for Christmas, so I ordered it from Amazon. I paid the best price here. When I opened it I realized the playset is mostly cardboard, with out lined hard plastic. Disappointed in Mattel. You'd like the entire thing would be sturdier.
B006LSZECO|5.0|As the mixed reviews indicate, this book is not for everyone, but I really loved it.  I'm normally put off by books that are full of unlikeable, self absorbed characters, but I guess it was the thriller aspect of this one that had me hooked, as I couldn't wait to find out what awful thing we were going to learn about Nick or Amy next.  Usually with a book I really love I don't want it to end, and I walk away hoping for a sequel.  This one needed to end when it did, although I agree that the ending itself could have been stronger, and I can't imagine a sequel dealing with what happens next!
0316227706|5.0|This book is awesome! My kids love dogs, so this was the perfect gift. Who'd have thought to take underwater photos of animals. You have to buy this.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I Loved the book. Some of the things they do are not my cup of tea, however, I loved the book.  It is actually about a love story, not any kind of domestic violence like some have said.  PLEASE!!! If those people think this book is about domestic violence, then they have never seen, lived, READ or been around it!  This is the farthest from domestic violence as you can get.  BE REAL PEOPLE!!! It's a love story, not your standard love story but one in the same.  Some of the &#34;Romance&#34; novels are much worse.<br /><br />If you are willing to have an open mind, then I highly suggest you reading these books.  I was fooled by the reviews until a friend of mine told me to read the 1st book before I believed what I was hearing about them.  I am soo glad I did! It was a very good read.  To the point, I ordered book two and three and enjoyed them all.
B008QE9XD2|4.0|This was a little different from your typical vampire movie, but funny.
B0044XRIMW|5.0|Didn't seem like it was being streamed at all. Great quality even on large HD screen. Certainly recommended over youtube.
B0047C2IIE|4.0|White Christmas is a classic album of Bing Crosby with the John Scott Trotter Orchestra and the Andrews Sisters. I already had the CD but downloaded it to my Kindle.  I highly recommend this album. I play Bing's album every year.
B0084IG8TM|1.0|The video skips 18 minutes (as far as I viewed).  I am very disappointed. I would like a refund or a new video.
B001M4YZ90|4.0|This has to be one of my top 10 movies, I really like the humor and the plot. The writing is awesome and I have watched this about 4 times. I picked this up as a gift for a friend. If you like movies like Snatch or Two Smoking Barrels then you probably have already seen this movie.. if not.. check it out you`ll love it.
B004498KPU|5.0|All of MJ's videos in one place, what would be more perfect?  I only wish this collection included iconic live moments like the Motown 25 special and others.
B009WO7NQO|1.0|Bought this game for my 7 year old. The game keeps asking for more money. Rovio, spend the $3 well becouse it will be the last you ever get from me.
B000V63BN6|5.0|All the songs you know and love by Stevie Wonder.  A wonderful collection that I would recommend to any fan.
B002VPE1XE|3.0|you recommended  me this case with camera nikon p510<br />but it is not suitable for the camera .it is small
B0053O89U6|5.0|Modern Family never fails to bring a smile to my face! I loved the first 2 seasons, and I am looking forward to this one too.
B008KE3960|4.0|Good but after a few planes you buy what's the point of collecting the gears? Half the planes you have to buy with REAL money.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|A quick but provocative read.  The story is compelling and the characters believable.  However, it is not a book that will draw the reader away from their everyday lives.  Rather, the underlying theme of the preciousness of time gives the reader something lasting to contemplate.
B00AMBM9MO|5.0|One of the funniest movies I have ever watched, really makes you cry you laugh so hard. Will end up buying this one
B000W93CHC|5.0|A page turner, that brings understanding of the horrors of the Black death and the consequences of the end of feudalism.  The rich development of each of the characters makes them all believable.  I to ready the next book in the series.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I had only heard a few songs of Adele's on the radio but went ahead and purchased the album hoping I would like it all.  I play this over and over inside the car and when I remember to bring it in the house, it goes on over and over there , too.  Great album! I love her style.
1878424319|5.0|Everybody should have at least 2 copies of this at all times.  One to keep and one to give to a friend when needed.
0307887448|5.0|An excellent romp through video game and 80's pop culture history! I finished this book in a day or two cause I could barely put it down! The author does an excellent job of weaving an action packed tale that keeps you engaged til the very end. If you've ever spent more than an hour playing video games, you need to read this book!
B006CQLGXG|5.0|When it said Illustrated, I thought it meant like Anamee, but it has great drawings in it. I have never read this and I'm glad I'm doing so now. It is funny in places and spooky in others. Great book to read during Christmas. A Must.
B009LRE040|4.0|I got ﻿the Darknight collection, I like ﻿the joker's one better, ﻿the part 2, this part 3 is not bad at all, for ﻿the final trilogy this is very good, incredible saga
B007VUA7VO|5.0|it works nothing is wrong with it it tells u when ur about to get a low battery but u hv to set it on that and when its fully charged
B000TFHJJQ|3.0|This is a good movie, it should be 3 and a half stars, I'm giving only 3 cos even though is good ,it's not one of those movies you want to watch twice, watch it once it's enough,
B001PB3RU8|2.0|This is ONLY my opion but like any cd, 2 good songs the rest filler. She holds her notes though.
B001QL5MAA|5.0|I give Revelation Space a 9/10, as vividly intelligent, scientifically plausible SF that successfully grapples with the universe on an epic scale. It's also simply a fun read.<br /><br />Khouri's \\"revelation,\\" pages 248-252, gave me chills. Reynolds gives us an awe-inspiring and plausible treatment of the galaxy's deep past, from the vantage point of the late 26th century. The revelations at the book's end are equally fascinating.<br /><br />The depiction of a few humans alone on a vast 4-kilometer-long ship, making runs between star systems at time-dilating relativistic speeds, is cozily haunting. And his overall human universe is neither utopian nor dystopian, more like present humanity extrapolated.<br /><br />I do think Reynolds' timeline of human technological development is overly optimistic, considering his adherence in other areas to scientific realism (ie no faster-than-light travel). (see timeline on the author's site: [...] )<br /><br />Looking at the current state of fusion research, it is hard to believe that humans will develop a fleet of near-light-speed, fusion-powered spacecraft in 200 years, even with our brains eventually augmented by supercomputers.<br /><br />He also has humans colonizing at least a 100-light year bubble and completely mastering genetic manipulation in 3 or 4 centuries. It would be a bit more plausible if he had these events occurring by 3566, or at least 3000, of course assuming no major societal collapse.<br /><br />And yes, at times the dialogue gets a bit low-brow, making an odd contrast against a backdrop of high-brow conceptual artistry. But in most places the dialogue is fine. For a professional hard scientist, Reynolds write wonderfully, and even the bits of questionable dialogue are better than your average paperback bestseller.<br /><br />In all this was a pleasure to read, and I look forward to the rest of Reynolds' creations.
0316228532|1.0|Tried to get into this book...not too interesting...will have to keep trying...the first chapter is not even caught my interest
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Awesome book! I love this series ! Greg is one of the funniest characters I have ever read about! This is a really good book! Good job Jeff Kinney
B0064X7FVE|2.0|Didn't realize it was a purchase. It is a free app on my phone. Would cancel of I know how.
B003WUYRGI|4.0|One time a girl Alaina falcon read a dictionary and she said it was STUPID.<br />the end .  ha ha ha
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book was not what I was expecting at all. It definitely keeps you on your toes as you're reading it. There are lots of twists and turns and right when you think you know what's about to happen... BAM!!! It a whole other scenario. The second book is soooooo good and everyone should read the the hunger games series.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|So many great quotes that anyone can think about when they're going through a hard time in life. You really get to know Charlie, and he really is a wallflower. This is my favorite book of all time.
B0082FPIY8|5.0|I loved this book, I laughed, I cried, I sympathised with her anguish over mountains that never seem to end; The ground levels out and you think surely this is the top,only for it to go up and up and up again.
B008F5YDRI|4.0|Very entertaining.. great story. Ewan McGregor is phenomenal .. all the acting was top notch. highly recommend it - very romantic and funny too!!
B004CFBMRY|5.0|..or slip on your vibrams! Having been told all through school, you shouldn't run you have flat feet, or feeling so ridiculously unfit that running was hell I decided that I was just one of those people that doesn't run. This book makes you want to get out there and go for it, to race and to get back to basics. You follow the races like you're actually watching them, put the book down and you might miss something, you just have to go on.<br />This book made me feel capable of finding a learn to run program, committing to it and finding the joy in running.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|Just see it.  The first reviews you scroll to are right.  The characters keep you watching, the music is really fine.  I am buying DVD for the music, too.  Bruce at his best, altho walking thru it, and doesnt that make it even more fun!
B00066VUPM|5.0|If you like some easy-going music that you can listen to for hours and hours, this is an excellent CD. I normally listen to the harder versions of rock, but on days that I just want to lay back and enjoy myself, I take out this disc. Hope you love it as much as I do!
B005LAJ17M|5.0|Homeland is among the top series ever. It is riveting and relentless! I find that while I want to watch more than one episode at a sitting, it is just too exhausting to do.
B005LAIHRC|5.0|Its a great movie  I ordered it in advance and when it was released got it asap.  I recommend this movie to everyone.
B000YHG72E|5.0|We watch this every year.  It's hysterical!  My son and I can't stop laughing.  It's a timeless classic!  Two thumbs up!
B003Y5H556|4.0|strange creepe movies does  not have  a plot or meaning to it no wonder it was cheap that ok i add to my collection
B0076DELIG|3.0|Harry is getting old and tired, and the story seemed to fit his frame of mind. A slow read.  Missing the gripping story of old.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Kids it is a great book and easy to read in days enjoy the book it is great<br />From  Jeff Kinney
0394800389|5.0|We opened this gift this morning for Christmas and took turns trying to read thru the tounge twisters.  We had a contest to see who could read the most pages without making a mistake! Dr. Seuss is always fun!
145210655X|5.0|The book is hilarious and it arrived just in time for Christmas. It was a gift for my husband. He loves Darth Vader!
0978606310|4.0|I got this for my daughter.  I don't know much about the topic, except that she is mostly interested in the older models.  It came promptly and seemed to be good quality.
B00020HEL6|5.0|Another line up of fresh songs by this renowned artist. Well executed and  easy listening. A must for the season.
B002MYUEWQ|5.0|The movie in which White Christmas is first sung by Bing Crosby. Just a Classic Christmas Movie with Crosby, Fred Astaire, Marjorie Reynolds, and Virginia Dale.  Great music and great dancing by the incomparable Fred Astaire!
B009WO7NQO|3.0|It is ok. Its fun but I had this solved in less than 30 minutes. You think your buyinv the whole  game but your not.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|A little technical but thought provoking - I enjoyed the book<br />and would recommend it to anyone seeking  information on this<br />experience
B00AMBK0X4|3.0|This movie was made out to be much more comical than it actually is. I waited for the movie to make it out of theaters, but I should also have waited for it to make it to television. Though some parts were funny, this wss more of a love story. It could be better.
B00APUYN0I|5.0|If you love music and singing, this is the movie for you!  It does have some sexual innuendos and so not the best for little kids but it is hilarious and the music is fantastic. I recommend you watch it!
1609611543|5.0|Finally someone explains what has gone wrong with the intestinal digestive system. This book is a great read and resource
B009JTCBLE|5.0|Bcc has been a fav band if mine for awhile..very unique and extremely talented rock band..my main hope is that they do a u.s. tour
B005WUHAX8|1.0|The case was very cheap and low quality, very disappointed. I was very happy on what I thought was going to e a steel of a deal, but soon figured out why it was such a steel
B007W8S2MG|4.0|It's absolutely perfect in many ways. If you've never played a Persona series, this is a fantastic starting point. It's the easiest game in the series and golden steps that up a notch by allowing you to actually continue after you die, so no more hours and hours lost because you forgot to save.<br /><br />The graphics and anime style compliment the already ridiculously Japanese-ness of this game. (Hope you like honorifics, I know I do.) The graphics are perfectly suited to such a game.<br /><br />This game can average 100~ hours of gameplay for a complete run, so you're in for a treat for the price.<br /><br />This game is certainly carried by its characters. Without them, there would be no drive. The cast is fantastic, the voice acting is superb. (... Sometimes.) And you'll be easily charmed by the party members.<br /><br />Overall:<br /><br />Gameplay: 4/5<br />Graphics: 4/5<br />Audio/Music: 5/5 (Absolutely fantastic.)
B007PF7MGS|5.0|History shows that members of royalty suffered many health issues and problems from eating rich foods and the obesity present in the American population reflects the same issues and problems. Dr. McDougall's approach, plus 44 years of experience of simplifying his patients diets is an excellent overview of the solution.
B00AA7O22U|4.0|Lots of gratuitous violence and mayhem in this one.  The plot takes the &#34;good guys&#34; up against the evil villan and of course the good guys prevail.<br />If you ever wanted to see all of your old action heros together at one time, this is the film for you.<br />I particularly like how the guys swap lines from the other guys older films.<br />It won't win an oscar, but it's a fun ride.
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|Lots of fun to draw with friends and family!  Some really good artists out there! My family absolutely loves it! But the game on my Kindle keeps quitting just as I finish a drawing. It also takes a long time to load. Plus it shuts down almost every time I open it! It's getting aggravating!
B0080R7Q70|2.0|Great musicians but hese guys are washed up.  Five years off and all they come up with is the same old hour and a half of noodling around..  Don't get me wrong; I really liked their earlier albums and own quite a few... it's just that the last three or four albums lack the clever hooks and interesting song formtion that made their earlier work so brilliant.  Go buy Marillion; they still have the touch.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|During a recent storm threat, I tracked my daughter's trip and gave her up to the minute details on the the weather thanks to the Weather Channel!  Love it!
B0043ZDU1E|5.0|Love Loreena's mix of old instruments and poetry.  Her songs always take me to far off places but also make me feel at home!
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Althought it's a great way to keep in touch with friends and family, it is very time consuming.  I just don't have the time to keep up with it. But my friends and family love it so it must be a good thing!
B004LE7PCM|5.0|I love having them all together like this, I did find it a little difficult to navigate it if you didn't want to read them in order but for the price I can't really complain all that much.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Wanted granddaughter to have this, the item came.  Really happy about the product was just what I thought it would be. Christ me praise.
B002XXLKHY|2.0|A cute story but a little too corny for me......It could have been at least 30 minutes shorter than it was.
B004LWZWGA|3.0|If left to my own devices I would be here for the next 2hrs and 44 mins complaining about the problems with this flick. That being said I would spend most of the time \\"nit-picking\\" this otherwise meh movie.<br /><br />Remove BATMAN from the equation an folks would hate on this movie. It's not a great or, in my opinion, a good movie. It's just O.K.<br /><br />Special effects and stunts were top notch. No boom mic in this movie.<br /><br />Reasons to nit-pick.<br /><br />FULL SPOILERS FROM THIS POINT ON!  REPEAT!!!  FULL SPOILERS FROM THIS POINT ON!!!<br /><br />FULL SPOILERS FROM THIS POINT ON!  REPEAT!!!  FULL SPOILERS FROM THIS POINT ON!!!<br /><br />!.  Bane sounded like a Brittish banker. Not at all Darth Vader like.<br />2.  Raz's daughter just wanted to sleep with the guy who muredered her father? For what reason? So she could stab Bruce with a pocket knife?!?<br />3.  \\"Hey I'm big scarry Bane, but the real villain is a 5ft brunette who Bruce had relations with.\\" Anybody who knows Batman lore or played the recent Arham games, knows that Raz has a daughter.<br />Shock value gone.<br />4.  Bruce's doctor wouldn't clear him for a ski trip. He gets a magical knee brace and he's back to form? Why did his captives let him keep the brace?<br />5.  Forget all that you know about spinal surgery. Now remember it. How much info was it? Not much I'm guessing.Do you think you can just punch a dislodged vartebrae back into place?<br />6.  How does Gotham, a city the size of Ney York, go without food for 5 months? They were isolated for months and I'm quit sure the grocery stores were empty after the first few weeks.<br />7.  Why were they keeping all the trapped Cops alive again? Providing much needed food and water for them. Why again?<br />8.  And lastley, because otherwise I'd be here longer and it's just a movie anyway. Robin!? Seriously? Robin wasn't even Robin's name. It was Dick. \\"Check under my Porno name...The Boy WOnder!\\".<br /><br /> I don't hate this movie, but Ithink it was the worst of the three. I may seem kinda ranty. If so it's because of the love-fest this flick recieved.<br /><br /> In closing I would like to say... Darknight rises is a good watch for people who can disconnect. If you are a movie buff, it's plot holes and indiscrepancies are going to bug you.<br /><br /> 3 out of 5 is a lil' too generous, but the first two were really good.
B003Y5H574|5.0|this is a must see movie for anyone!! i first seen this movie on tv and thought it was great, so when i saw this on amazon deal i couldnt passed it up!!! so watch this movie
B00AMBK6J2|4.0|If you like the raunchy humor of Family guy, you'll like this movie.., also worth it to see the beautiful Mila Kunis.
B00A9C3RB8|1.0|waste of money, didn't like it. turned off before movie was over. . . . . . . . .
B007J4T2G8|4.0|This book is good. Now it may be a lot of sex but it's good SEX! 0Would have liked to no more about Mr. Grey and they really could have had a better story line. Overall I liked it.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was nothing I thought it would be, but still so good that I can't stand it. Colleen Hoover was born to write books for readers to read!
0446581356|4.0|The book comes with no flaw, and i like the content.<br />i think i will suggest this book for all the makeup lovers..
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great follow up.  Loved Hunger Games and this really just keeps the great story you going.  I think I will start the third book right now.
B00AHSMDQY|5.0|started out slow but got really good.  Unique twist on the batman saga. I would watch it again. Christian Bale is a much better Batman than the others
B000W7JWUA|5.0|This is a truly great game for most ages once learned, which takes some time it is a game you will want to play time after time. Also great for a family game, though more towards older children. Thre are many games similar to this I would also recommend such as carcasonne.
B009E3EY4M|5.0|I have to admit, when I first started watching the Blu-Ray, I thought 'man, these guys have gotten old.'  But they can still blast out heart pounding rock and roll.  I really loved the music and the performance.  Watching it on HD TV and a good sound system is a must.  I definitely recommend both the Blu-Ray and CDs.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|kept pulling me in to want to read the next chapter and the flow was perfect with history and current story.
B004BC7MRM|5.0|What can I say, the man is a creative genius. not only is he a great entertainer but he really connects with his fans.

B00005J9PB|5.0|Got it for a friend and she said nothing lost in the conversion to DVD. Love this movie, you should see it!
B004UID2LC|5.0|Incredible app. I use it almost daily. My favorite feature is to be able to save videos that have a remix of my favorite song that you wouldn't be able to find anywhere else.
B002QBS9KE|5.0|There is no need to purchase a new voyager headset. These replacement ear tips work as advertised and now my voyager is comfortable again.
B0086449YA|5.0|We loved the music on Privateering.  Mark Knopfler is an exceptional music and song writer.  We have most of his music.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I could not put this book down. I started it in the evening and stayed up to the wee hours of the morning to finish it.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|WELL WORTH THE MONEY!!!!  WHAT A GREAT PRICE, BETTER THAN ANYWHERE ELSE. I am positive all of my children will love them.  Bought 3
B004EPZ07K|5.0|It's not 007 but it is Green Lantern.  I am wondering if James can tell me the difference when I see him next time.
B0085RQLXK|3.0|I love Areosmith. there are some good songs on the cd. I really like the duet with Carrie Underwood. Steven Tyler is awesome.
0547884591|5.0|A very practical guide to cooking... and unlocks the mystery behind lots of myths... learned a lot from reading it... excellent reference book for cooking.
B008HK3XKO|4.0|This case fits my Fire HD 7 inch very well.  It is a hard case which protects my Fire when I put it in my purse.  I like the elastic strap which slides on easily to close the case.<br />The case folds back flat to make it easy for me to hold as a reader.  It also props as a standing case for viewing movies.<br />There is nothing really spectacular about this case, but it's a good, functional case for the Fire HD 7 inch.
B000YAA68W|5.0|Wonderfully done... An excellent DVD for anyone who wants to learn about Iran and for parents who want to treach about Iranian history to their kids.
B005LAIHXQ|5.0|Innovative science fiction that does a nice job of prequeling out the alien franchise. I found it to be very enjoyable.
B0055PGUYU|4.0|This book is really just an interesting study of how the brain works. I totally enjoyed the ideas that habits can be broken and how they're formed. Highly recommend!!
B006LSZECO|4.0|Interesting take on something we see in the news too frequently.  Very well written.  I was a little disappointed in the ending, but ,overall, a good yarn .
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|This was a wonderfully made movie the acting was great and the plot was intense.  The only people who don't like this movie are either the tards that are comic book fanatics or the ones who think that Michael Keaton was the bomb :)  I do like Michael keaton, his version was cartoony and corny while this version was for the grownups.
B0092MKFIY|5.0|I like alternative rock. Although it's not in my genre of music, I bought this album solely based on the reviews. I'm glad I did. This is one of the albums I often listen to on my commute.
0062082353|4.0|The page edges are not trimmed on the book. Really looking forward to reading the book. My wife got it for me for christmas.

B003WUYRGI|1.0|this book is really cool because I can look up any word I want to whenever I want and my dad thinks its cool to so it really helps with my school work!
B005NFJAXU|5.0|This series gets VERY interesting once it gets into the angels and demons section, it has a dark feel to it most of the time. Very talented actors and actresses throughout, If you like ghosts, vampires, spirits, werewolves, or anything of the sort then this is a show for you.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|This book has some of the intricacies that I love about Clancy early novels. The cyber threat posed is believable and for that reason, scary. Very enjoyable book. It moves at a nice pace and was a fun, exciting read.Tom and his partner author have done a great job in entertaining and to a smaller extent educating the reader. What more can we ask of them?
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|If you are looking for a completely adorable movie to watch as a family, this is it. Filled with whimsical characters, this movie will both entertain as well as give the subtle message that good triumphs over bad, and that hope should always be a part of life.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|Really good book so enjoyed reading it would recommed to everybody. It has drama mystery the strange should appeal to a lit of people.
B00999DFP0|5.0|I love this show and the seasons arrived early and have been wonderful. The seasons were still in original shrink wrap and play perfectly.
0307895475|5.0|So glad I bought this not sure I how I would complete this game without it. has everything and more.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|I did not want to watch this show when it first came out but I gave it a shot and now I LOVE IT!!! Highly recommended!
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Great dragon game. A lots of games like this, but this is one of the best. Reminds me of we city.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I'm fascinated by this series.  I'm a psychiatric nurse and have heard stories of how psych units were back in the 60's.  This runs pretty true to what I've heard.  Of course, minus the mutants, space aliens and psychopathic staff.  Oh, and there weren't any demons then or now.  Nazis either.  But still...wow!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|What a Great read! This book was very interesting! Co workers programming about it and now know what!<br />Highly recommended
B007V65R54|5.0|If you've read his blog, you know Silver is a good writer.  This book doesn't disappoint at all.  From politics to baseball to the weather, he delves into why our information culture has so much difficulty using all the information available to us to make accurate forecasts.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Quick & easy read - well worth all the Kleenex. Written from the dog's point of view, so an interesting twist.<br />Definately recommend it for all animal lovers.
B007R3AZNK|5.0|Driving Towards The Daylight. Blues by Joe Bonamassa, my favorite guitar god. GREAT CD. You want this one for your collection.
B00AA7O6QC|4.0|My three 20 something year old sons, my brother and I watched this movie on a whim when we decided we were too tired to go out to a late movie. It may have been the company, but we had a blast watching this. It was so over the top at times that we were laughing and rolling our eyes knowing it was planned tongue-in-cheeck. There were heart wrenching scenes too, but the fun of it helped to keep the viewer from dwelling on the sad parts. I imagined the actors had a great time making this movie.
B004WDRT1Y|5.0|This was one of my  Mom's favorite newer Disney movies.  We had this one on VHS and then when this edition was issued I got it.  Mom died before I could play it for her, but I will cherish this movie and my own favorite Disney films always.  It's not just the wisdom hidden in each film, but also the joy, courage, strength, heart and so much more, that are Disney hallmarks.  I've noticed the Pixar partnership has may Disney qualities in their films as well.  And I enjoy may of them.  These films are not just for kids, but all people.
0071813721|5.0|This book is an excellent resource for creating engaging social media content. It provides a blueprint that is easy to follow. A can't miss book for social media marketing pros.
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|Enjoyed the Batman trilogy a great deal. I failed to see the Dark Knight Rises in a theater, but the $1.99 rental fee made it a real winner.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|my daughter got me hooked on game but I can never get more than 50 coins but I will keep trying!!!
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Solid hidden object and puzzle adventure.  Dark mysterious spooky atmosphere.  Nice sound and control.  Great storyline.  Well worth the price.  Should have had Batman in it.
B009VSW15Y|4.0|Well kinda... you just go to photos and press the camera  button in the top corner.<br />You can only take picture  though...<br />And it  not as advanced as this one.
B009ZE27US|5.0|It's a pretty nice app to waste 5-ish minutes, not all that entertaining in the long run. What are you going to expect from a scan-your-finger game? Tried this on my little sister (11) and she got 74. LOL!!! It's not so bad, if you finally realize that it's not actually supposed to work.<br /><br />Note the use of grammar.
B007MDB6L0|5.0|Anything Disney produces is a wholesome family type movie which is a good choice for children in today's society .
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|I watched this twice in 8 hours and enjoyed it immensely. Seth uses all the comedy tools at his disposal; and they are numerous.  .
B001FB4VXU|5.0|We're fans of the shows but without cable TV we haven't been able to see all the episodes.  First season was really good. Only downside was the price dropped once I bought & then I found the 1st-5th season for $6.99 each on Christmas Special at a local grocery store. :( Too late -wasn't returning it since it was already wrapped up for a gift for Christmas. O'well.
B00AMBH70S|5.0|Photography, high tech, good acting, it had it all! A film that makes a patriots actions (Ed Norton) blur the line between right and wrong.

1451662432|5.0|I was very impressed with this book. It shows the contrasts between his poor upbringing and his later success. In one of his earlier autobiogs he gave a few more details about his love life while starting out as a bodybuilder in austria. It is isnpiring and shows what anyone can become wht the drive and conviction that he has. I plan on rereading it

B00AA7O22U|4.0|But it still satisfies my lust for good ol' action. As American society is becoming more and more feminized these kind of movies (and men) are dying out. Enjoy them while you can.

B002BI6SMI|2.0|I really did not realize that Liam Neeson cannot act until I saw this movie. The idea was to have this guy mimic Jason Bourne but he fails depressingly while trying. The teenage girl is a super annoying silly brat and some of the escapes are beyond the boundaries of disbelief. I am sorry I paid money to watch it.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|If your smart this is the game for you all german back gournd people love this game because of its brillience.
B004C3DLJS|5.0|A very satisfying finish for our favorite collection of toys as Andy departs for college. I wish the villian had a more painful ending because he certainly deserved it.
B007K3JCAE|4.0|Really enjoyed this movie! It's fun to see Robert Downey Jr. doing so many great movies again! Check this one out, you won't be disappointed.
B005ZKYXZI|4.0|[THIS REVIEW IS SPOILER FREE]<br /><br />I never caught this film at the theatre because I thought that it would be just some mindless \\"smash and bash\\" (i.e. HULK SMASH) type of action film.<br /><br />Well, I was glad to be proven wrong! :)<br /><br />My family and I really enjoyed this movie from the beginning all the way to the end.<br /><br />YES, it is an \\"action\\" film with plenty of Robot smashing and bashing.<br />However, the screen writers have managed to weave a very plausible tale of lost love (and family), betrayal and final redemption into this movie.<br />The plot and movie lines were really engaging and filled with irony.<br />For example, there was this scene whereby the protagonist's 11 year old son ticks off his old man for acting like a child! :)<br /><br />This movie deserves 4.5 stars for the superb original storyline, fine acting and heartfelt dialogue. At the end of the film, this movie will make you feel warm and fuzzy inside ala \\"As Good As It Gets\\".<br />This film is therefore highly recommended.
B005LAIHPY|3.0|Not a lot of big surprises in this movie but we loved the alien sequences and the battles were great! My wife left the movie during the end credits and we had a bit of a friendly dispute over whether or not she missed some extra footage at the end of the movie.  Make sure and watch it all the way through the end!
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|I would recommend this app to people who would like to have a decent PDF reader. You can import your PDF files to the app to view.
B0034G4P8A|5.0|Loved this movie! Enjoyed it with the entire family several times. The blue ray offerings were a lot of fun too!
B00AGH6FD8|5.0|It's better than Home Alone part I.  Not many (if at all) questionable words being said throughout the movie.  There were clever traps that Kevin set that tied part I in nicely.<br /><br />We all enjoyed this movie.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|Our granddaughter was excited to see that she had received the movie.  I think she is going to enjoy it.
B0016YBFZ8|5.0|This is one of my husbands favorite movies and I purchased it for him for Xmas.  The quality of blu-ray is so much better.
B002J3ELR4|3.0|Mostly okay, but without the subtitles, you loose all the interplay between Christopher Lee and Toshiro Mifune (such brilliant casting).  Also, weirdly edited. All the black/white racial comedic/commentary interaction is edited out, but Belushi is still allowed to say \\"eat lead slant\\"  Some whole scenes are missing (Slim Pickens capture).  Sometimes it's 10 or 20 seconds of transition or explanation that someone randomly thought was unnecessary (it is).  Hard to believe this film was ever released in this format anywhere.  It watches more like a local TV station edit for time and commercials.  Transfer is not what I would consider HD quality.
B0002EXH5O|5.0|Love me some Megadeth to help me get through at work! and this is by far one of my fav cd to listen while I'm working!<br />So much energy and fun. Also I'm a Megadeth fan and this is one of their most brutal and great albums.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|It was  roughly two years ago that I first picked up ROOM. I tossed it aside dismissing it as a lazy writer an  lazy editors attempt at publishing a story without  any sort of grammatical corrections or sense of actually having to tell a real story. I WAS WRONG. It is harrowing tale of a woman who chooses to overcome her situation and survives a terrifying ordeal because it isn't just her life on the line. My only complaint, I would have loved to actually read about Old Nick getting his!
B008MIMWOO|5.0|This set is killer! The box set is Funky and bright. The discs were well packed and the sleeve was in great shape. The film is extremely colorful and on Blu-Ray it is intensely fun!<br />I love it! I hope you will too!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I bought a cheap Android tablet from HSN last year and just downloaded Kindle for Android. It copied all of my kindle books and is super fast to download new purchases! I highly recommend!
B004FA8NOQ|5.0|This is a replacement for my initial order.  I have built for myself and later upgraded at least 10 computers, all with  Intel procs. This processor replaced an i5 2500, and for the first time I received a bad processor-- the first one just would not boot, I was getting memory error.  Thanks to Amazon policies I was able to return the defective processor and had a replacement in just a few days. It installed with no problems and what a difference. I am currently running it at 4.1ghz using the stock Intel cooler and it idles at ~30c and the highest I've seen is 73c under full load. I will be ordering a better cooler in a week or so from Amazon and will be running this processor at 4.5.

B005NJU8PA|5.0|If you enjoyed the 4-Hour Workweek and 4-Hour Body, this is right up your alley.  This is a book about accelerated learning disguised as a cookbook.  Tim uses his story about learning to cook to demonstrate how to use the accelerated learning concept.  He also fills in details on his slow-carb diet from the 4-Hour Body.  There are several recipies in this book, but you will also learn how to memorize a deck of cards, build a fire, butcher a chicken, and capture a pigeon.  Tim also throws in some gun & knife reviews as well as a chemistry lesson.  Even if you don't cook a single recipie in the book, the fascinating way he writes makes this worth buying.<br /><br />I purchased the Kindle edition, and it is nicely linked.  When Tim mentions something, he usually includes a link.  This is very helpful in a book this size because it helps you navigate around.  It also includes X-Ray.  There are also a lot of resources available on his website.<br /><br />The accelerated learning aspect of the book was very interesting to me.  Tim had touched on the idea in his previous book, the 4-Hour Body, but he expands on the ideas more in this one.<br /><br />I liked this book even more than his first two, and I'm excited to see what he comes up with next!o do something you've already beaten 80% of the people out there.<br /><br />I liked this book even more than his first two, and I'm excited to see what he comes up with next!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I really hate to read but once I picked this book up I could hardly put it down. If you like action, you'll love this book.
B008M721MS|1.0|can not skype video does not show and I can barely here contacts<br />not sure why and can't find out how went on skype for instructions no help adand no help from Amazon
B00A8ECU24|4.0|This game has pretty good graphics and is very fun. I would recommend it for anyone who is a fan of the tv show.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I love this show. I thought the first season was original and horrific but the have outdone themselves with the second season.
B0098VYCCE|3.0|Glad I did not spend the money to see in the theater.  Was expecting more content. Worth the money as a rental though.
B005V2EVBQ|1.0|I don't know if I was sent the wrong case, but this case does NOT fit the Kindle Fire HD.  It fits a normal Kindle, but not HD.  I am disappointed because I actually like the case.
B00APUYN0I|4.0|Watched this one with kids and grand kids (all over 12 years old) and we all loved it!  Music is great and we laughed and laughed.
B009SQQRH2|5.0|We loved this movie and thought the characters were great.  Grand Santa is hilarious!  Fun for the whole family and we loved it so much that we will likely buy it.
B004QOB8SO|5.0|Season two is by far the best season of this show - based on the most famous classics and done so well!!
B009HEJXFS|5.0|Good sequal.  Wish the movie was a little longer.  Makes me want to re-watch MIB and MIB2 all over again!
B000ATQYT2|5.0|This movie DOES have the song, \\"The Love is Gone\\"in it, I am watching it right now.  You have to go to scene selection, choose the first scene and then when it asks you to choose, pick \\"full screen EXTENDED version.  ALL the scenes are in this version.  This is and always has been my favorite Muppet moveie!
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|just love her voice.  reduces stress.  calming.  A great way to spend relaxing from a xmas dinner or shopping sprees...
B0054JZC6E|3.0|enjoying games so far, but most are games that aren't that replayable. so its sometime hard to score enough points to unlock new games.
B00APUQJLO|1.0|This was the worst movie I have ever seen.. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. ..
B001P9KR8U|5.0|This movie is the best movie I've ever had the pleasure of viewing. The way Jamal tells his story because he's suspected of cheating is such an interesting idea.  The fact that the story is told through flashback is also very interesting.  What I like the most though is that Jamal and Latika, despite all odds, always make it back to each other.
B00AGOGOLE|3.0|I like the pictures quality, that was nice. But figuring out how to use it was a little hard. Have already<br /> recommended it to a friend. It does what I need. Thank you
B009RI4FRU|5.0|Loved this quirky sweet movie from beginning to end. Great performances all around. Nothing typical about his delightful hilarious movie.
B001QD5OSS|5.0|Who doesn't  like a &#34;based on a true story&#34; movie?  George Jung played by Johnny Depp is a fascinating person and lead an interesting life! And he'll be released in 2014/2015.... go George!
0316069434|5.0|Connelly is one of my favorite writers and one of only a couple whose new work I will buy automatically. He's never let me down. Have yet to read his latest but it is next up on my list. Looking forward to it.
B005LAJ17M|4.0|Decided to buy this and check it out after so much hype surrounding it and I enjoyed it for the most part. The only thing I didn't care for was the love story between the female agent and the suspect. I felt it was really unnecessary and It did nothing for the story. I wish they would have just stuck with the story of her suspecting him and working towards uncovering it. Once she developed feelings for him the show became a bit annoying because it lost its speed
B0053O89U6|5.0|I have a bunch of Can't Miss sitcoms on TV - but Modern Family is at the top of the list. Consistently the best written and acted on Tv. In three + season I have yet to say a bad episode. the cast is a riot and the writers give every wonderful character their moment to shine in every show. Love this one big time. So do my kids - who went in on the pirchase of this item.

B002N5N5R0|5.0|Got addicted to this show by watching it on Netflix!  When Amazon had them on sale for $16.99 season 1-3 I jumped at it! For Blu-ray!!!! No brainer!!!!!
B00846REIS|5.0|Couldn't put it down, finished in two days, beautifully written. Can't wait to start the second in the series. Won't be able to wait for the release date of the third tho..
B0024FAR5W|5.0|Obsessed with this show since watching on Netflix. When I saw the price the first three seasons were selling for I jumped at it! Can't wait for next two seasons, ill get them too.

B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Out of all the Diary of a Wimpy Kid books I've read, this is my favorite. The humor and realism combine to create an amazing story. This is truly my first recommendation for humor lovers.
B002QW7ALM|5.0|This movie was great. It had an in depth plot that used the intrinsics of the situations to scare you instead of cheaply jumping out at you.<br />I have not been this satisfied with a movie in a while.

B008K9SG9K|5.0|Decided to give them a shot after hearing Radio Active on a TV commercial. This album in a beautiful way, ROCKS! It's not boring, same old same old. It's original, moving, interesting, and just fun. I love throwing my cans on and turning the volume up. Give it a shot, you won't be sad you did.

B00AF6MF9I|3.0|The only issues I have with this game are: 1)the game never saves where I left off, then I need to recreate stuff. That is annoying and a waste of time. 2) they really push you to buy their stuff in order to proceed...annoying. other than that very fun
B003NFM3JU|5.0|This is a great movie. The ultraviolet digital copy is an awesome feature.  I like the fact I can watch the movie anywhere that has Internet.
0062127241|4.0|Townshend has always been one of the most intellectual of rock stars. That said, he is also one of the most contrary and puzzling of persons. Townshend sought to be in the limelight, but hates anyone who didn't agree with him. This book is very good, but like most people, Pete Townsend tries to place himself in a \\"better light\\" than the actual truth. It is interesting to read about his background and his marriage and song writing. Townsend tends to look upon some of his work as something more than simple \\"pop\\", when in fact \\"Tommy\\" is just English vaudville. This book drags in several chapters, in other chapters you wish they wouldn't finish. Well worth a read.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Great book. This book is written very well. It really opens up how lucky we are to be Americans. Recommend all to read.
B00AHXIC50|4.0|I love Bruno Mars and love the songs on this CD. I just wish there were more than 10 songs.

B008H6GHL0|5.0|For fans of RE who liked Degeneration, you should like this movie even more. The CG-I work here is better, the story is more fleshed out with better pacing, the music and action is awesome, and the side characters have their own individual backstory that you can become easily invested in.<br /><br />It's a great example of what fun can come of working with CG-I. (It just boggles the mind how the movies in this series have gotten better while the games have arguably gotten worse.)
B007IXWKUK|2.0|This story & an abusive relationship run hand & hand.  I was a little disturbed by his \\"stalker\\" tendencies.  Ana needs to stop apologizing for every damn thing.  That got on my nerves.  However on the lighter side, the sex was steamy most of the time.  Laters, Baby!

Enjoy this game with friends or your opponents over the Internet!
B007S3S8HO|4.0|My almost 6 year old son received this as a Christmas gift.  He loved setting it up....had no problem doing that on his own.  I've read other reviewers complaining about the set not staying together.  We didn't have a problem.  Yes, it's not like Legos but you don't want it to be THAT sturdy or the birds could never knock it down.  So the blocks are ok but the sling shot stinks.  I have to help my son use it and even with my help it stinks.  We're thinking of making our own.  If they could just come up with a better sling shot, we'd be 5 star happy.
B007TXN4TK|2.0|I'd recommend you by the non-free version. I'm not much of a piano person, but I like these types of apps. The programming could use some work(I mean it's 2012). But, it's simple if your child or  younger spouse is playing it.

B009VSW15Y|3.0|I'm not very happy that this was hidden from me. I wish I had known from Amazon at all that I could take pictures. It's HD makes the camera amazing! But, I wish I could &#34;flip&#34; my camera like I can with phone. I don't really like it because it makes group pictures REALLY complicated.
B0017SWPXY|4.0|It was a really good book with some good life lessons as well.. it trials off at times but over all a good book.
0060872675|5.0|Story grew out of a Discworld tale wherein Sam Vimes must rush home from work in time to read &#34;Where's My Cow?&#34; to his little boy. This mixes that tale with the &#34;where's my cow?&#34; part of the story, so it entertains the older reader, too. Fun.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I thought this rating fit because the book was amazing. I recommend this book to anyone who has read the books before this one. It was a little confusing at parts but I'm guessing those weren't the important parts.

0812452240|5.0|Having read literally all of Stephen King's writings, I have continually pointed to &#34;It&#34; as being what I consider to be the best of his books. Some of my friends and acquaintances have said that they don't care for the horror genre too much and I've pointed out that it's also one of the finest books about coming of age and the value of friendships as the group must discover the power of love to confront their common fears. That being said, you can count on this book to startle and surprise you as King takes us down roads that we're almost unwilling to travel. King's skill as a wordsmith is evident on every page by imbuing his writing with a mixture of hope and dread.
B008BM0IUG|4.0|Without the author's ability to analogize key points, this subject would be almost totally obscure to the lay reader. However, Carroll's writing prowess makes this inscrutable subject sufficiently understandable that we can begin to appreciate the magnitude of the accomplishment that occurred in July at CERN's Large Hadron Collider. Toward the end of the book, his analogy of tiny robots with sails inside a vacuum chamber makes plausible the fact that everything is immersed in a special kind of field that gives each particle its unique character. I would have given it five stars except for the fact that much of the explanations still eluded me. Author did best he could but I'm just not intellectually robust enough to follow along. Even so, I'd recommend this book for anyone who would like to get a sense of why basic scientific research is important. And to gain respect for the wondrous complexity of the physical universe.
B004HO6I4M|4.0|I loved watching this cute story and I really enjoyed the music throughout the movie! I would highly recommend this movie, especially to families with children, but as an adult without any kids I own it and love watching it!
B00AMBM9MO|5.0|Good stoner movie sorta like Wilfred but with less than cerebral trickery. Ted is a bong hitting boozing crude womanizer.
B005RJ6AIK|5.0|One of the best movies I have ever seen. The story line flows beautifully, with masterful cinematography. The soundtrack has been chosen from some of the best contemporary Hawaiian music. George Clooney should have won the Academy Award for best actor. This movie has something for everyone who loves a good picture. I have personally turned over 20 people on to this film. It should have won for Best Picture and Best Director too. It is a film that will eventually stand the test of time. I do get carried away by the movie and the music keeps that feeling going. Wonderful stuff!
B00A4TKDKY|5.0|Buddy Guy. Buddy Guy. Buddy Guy. Yes Buddy Guy where I can yell his name out loud at the top of my lungs - just like I did at Crossroads in 2010.<br /><br />Buddy Guy spends the month of January playing at his club in Chicago. Legends is a club, not an acoustically designed concert hall, this recording captures the raw feel of that club.<br /><br />Buddy Guy Live at Legends is not a perfect recording, it does lack bottom end and the mix isn't always perfect. But the mix focuses on his virtuoso guitar playing and incredible stage presence - the things I want to hear. Last year I went to one of Buddy's shows at Legends. This disc captures the rawness of his performance.<br /><br />Seven of the ten recordings are live at Legends; the other three are from his sessions in Nashville for Living Proof. The final three tracks are excellent, cleanly recorded, full sound. Somebody had to make choices for Living Proof, and these three tracks just didn't make it.<br /><br />The live recording is exactly how I remember Buddy at Legends. Buddy is a showman, he has no set list for each night, he plays what he feels like playing each night - no two shows are the same. Buddy Guy has influenced so many guitarists, Jimi Hendrix, Eric Clapton, and Stevie Ray Vaughn. He is a master on the guitar. And this recording shows what a great musician he still is, well into his 70's. His shows sell out every night and the club is packed to standing room only.<br /><br />I love the organic nature of the blues. Pristine studio recordings have their place, perfect for the radio. The blues is meant to be heard in a nasty old club with bad acoustics, the feeling of the room, the artist working with the audience - that is the blues to me. Legends is a deep narrow club with the stage facing the narrow width - acoustics be forgotten, this allows more people to see the stage. On Damn Right I Got the Blues, Buddy takes his tour through the audience. With a wireless guitar and microphone, Buddy plays and sings a song through his whole club, including the second floor. He stops a few times for people to sing. Everybody gets to see Buddy up close and personal, not just the people that camped out early to get a front row table (my wife and I did just that, front row table).<br /><br />This disc took me back to that night at Legends. Since Buddy has no set list, how does his band know what to play? Simple, Buddy starts a song, they figure out which one he is doing and they fill in behind him (yes generally the blues is fairly simple music - but his band is so in tune with him, they know what he is doing next). He frequently steps to the side and lets his excellent band shine - Rick Hall, the other guitarist besides Buddy, steps forward and plays as almost Buddy's equal.<br /><br />The album probably should have a warning; there is a lot of strong language. In fact it opens with a massive f bomb, Tom Marker, of WXRT Chicago radio station, blasts a huge enthusiastic welcome for Buddy. Sorry to anybody that purchased this album unknowingly - but that f-bomb in the introduction is loud and clear in the Amazon previews for this album. Buddy drops the bomb a number of times during songs. Here's the deal, this performance is in a bar, and everybody there has to be 21 to enter. Of course there will be rawness and coarse language.<br /><br />The first five recordings are incredible. Good long blues songs, great guitar solos, and Buddy in prime form. The banter is pure Buddy. He talks about messing up a song to make it his own. Skin Deep probably finds its way into every set, it is a classic written by Buddy and a fantastic song. The last two live tracks are the weakest. Boom Boom and Strange Brew finish about the time they get started. Well, that's the way Buddy played them, and that's what we get to hear. I would have loved to hear more of the Hendrix song, Voodoo Chile, Buddy does that song so well. The night I heard him, he did play that song a lot longer. He transitions into Clapton's (Cream) Sunshine of Your Love to close out his set thanking his band members. His closing song the night we saw him ran for about 20 minutes, on the CD they just faded it away after he thanked his band. Choices do have to be made for an album.<br /><br />The album is not perfectly recorded. If it was, this wouldn't be Buddy Guy at Legends, it would be Buddy Guy in the studio, or at Crossroads, or at some other venue. If there was a comparison to be made, this is almost Buddy Guy's version of BB King Live at the Regal. Neither is a perfect recording, but darn it they are both amazing blues.<br /><br />And after this man well into his 70's plays for 2 hours non-stop, he spends an hour signing autographs for anybody that wants one.lapton's (Cream) Sunshine of Your Love to close out his set thanking his band members.

It's #91 on Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time...so what praise can I give this classic Elton John album that hasn't already been given?<br /><br />Since I can't think of anything new, I will leave it at saying, Elton John and Bernie Taupin at their ultimate best. Deserves to be in every audiophile's collection.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Wow! Colleen Hoover is such a gifted storyteller. Hopeless is such an unexpected story to read. Sky is strong-minded and incredibly beautiful (in & out) but in a very believable way. This story will take you on a journey that you were not able to imagine in the beginning of the book. You may think this is a standard YA strong alpha boy meets girls but there's no way it goes in that direction. Yes it's about romance and yes our guy is drool worthy but in this case he will suck you in this story and take you on a very emotional journey. Thank you Colleen for this wonderful ride.

B009NQKXYK|3.0|Great movie keep me interested most of the time. I am still disappointed at the quality of scifi, and well all movies coming out lately. Seems like the goal is not to make a great movie anymore. Just to get something out that has a few scenes that can be used as good shots for the trailer to get people out to watch it. While the plot was a little richer than most and the acting was fair. The story line gets weak. they could have made this movie so much better.
B003DNN0L2|5.0|Very funny!!! My husband and I loved it. Not for young kids, though. Our 8-year-old didn't get most of the humor.
B00ARAN9JW|2.0|The action scenes are absolutely over the top childish. Even if they made the action sequences as comedy it wouldn't have been funny. They brought back a couple of the worst characters from the previous movies. The dialogue and acting seems like the movie was thrown together as quickly as possible to get the movie out and make money. Very disappointing. Story line is absurd even for a &#34;horror&#34; movie. i would say the ending leaves a lot to be desired but everything up until that point was terrible so I expected a terrible ending. The only redeeming quality to the movie was Mia Jovavich and all the detailed scenery and settings.

My girlfriend was hypnotised, of course.<br /><br />Great product!

The only thing is that if you're a kindle fire user, the spell shop and the portal are not going to be available. Team-lava doesn't pay that much attention to the amazon app store.

B0000TB01Y|5.0|In school my music teacher was big on Broadway productions. We literally spent our class room hours STUDYING (and i do mean STUDYING) Broadway musicals and plays. The Lion King, Aida, Cats, Les Miserables, The Phantom of the Opera, and various others. But among these titles &#34;Wicked&#34; is most definitely one of my favorites. It has been years, and when i finally found this soundtrack with the original cast that my teacher from so long ago once owned, i was ecstatic. The music really brings the story to life!

B00AB0AXU6|1.0|This installment of the series seems to be nothing but action and no story.<br />And yet again, it's another movie to precede another future movie.<br />It's becoming boring. There's such a lack of story that, having rented it, I found it as a waste of money.<br />I really enjoyed the first and second movie because, at least, it was feasible and the story was realistic.<br />The succeeding movies seemed to be just movies because they could make them just for giggles.<br />I was incredibly disappointed.<br />There was no point in bringing in Ada and Leon as well as the others. The whole point in bringing them in as well as the others back just appears to be a desperate attempt to bring interest to viewers until they actually watch the movie. That's how I felt. At first, I was all \\"I'm so excited to see Jill come back\\". After seeing the movie, I felt ---> \\"What the hell? That's it? What was the point? So they can make another movie?\\" It just seems ridiculous now.
B000EHRVP6|2.0|...............does not waste his precious time watching TRASH like this. I'll confess that some \\"sado-masochistic\\" porn movies are stimulating, but that is within the scope of a very limited situation (self-satisfaction) having nothing to do with sheer entertainment, or using the word ART (BLASPHEMY!!) for useless rubbish like this. Those porn movies are \\"Snow White\\" compared to this......<br />And you ask WHY our world has descended into the horror in which we live? Or is this Liberal turning right-wing at the age of FIFTY?<br />The night was dull, surfing channels was my momentary fix, and I stumbled onto this.<br />Curiously, most serendipitous, since at this very moment a very controversial movie is making the rounds around America with the issue of Osama Bin Laden and our government's torture \\"program\\" surrounding our two most recent wars (ZERO DARK THIRTY).<br />The \\"revelation\\" is that this movie was produced in part by that PHONY, DESPICABLE, MEDIOCRE Sado-masochistic man by the name of TARANTINO. I have always thought him to be a basically populist seller of VICE, cheap entertainment, and (reluctantly, I must say) moments of a certain visionary streak. After all, \\"RESERVOIR DOGS\\" is a \\"good\\" film about torture and vengeance about SCUM that proves entirely believable.......<br />So there you are....<br />You know that when you watch a PORN film you give blessings to the Gods for the creation of the \\"Fast-Forward\\" button?

B00AMBH70S|4.0|I liked that anyone could watch this movie and get into it without having to watch the previous ones. I give this movie 4 stars because the plot and overall concept of the movie was amazing...but I can't help but feel that they could have executed the whole thing differently. There were parts of the movie that had me feeling like there was some information missing that could have helped the viewer understand more completely what was going on. The acting in the movie was exceptional. Personally, I'm not a fan of Matt so it was refreshing to see a more seasoned actor in the lead. There definitely enough action in this movie to keep you on the edge of your seat and I especially enjoyed the suspense.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|\\"The sky is always beautiful. Even when it's dark or rainy or cloudy, it's still beautiful to look at... it'll be there no matter what... and I know it'll always be beautiful.\\"<br /><br />Wow. I feel like I have been saying this a lot lately but just... Wow. I have been fortunate enough to read some really amazing books in 2012 and I feel like I have been handing out 5 Stars reviews like they are candy but the level of writing that I have been reading has been deserving of that praise. Hopeless is no exception and for me it is right up there with the best of the best of this year. This book was simply amazing.<br /><br />This is the first Colleen Hoover book that I have read and I can guarantee you that it will not be the last. I will be honest in saying that I didn't know what to expect when starting this book. I had just finished another book and while I was writing that review I noticed a few of my friends on Goodreads talking about Hopeless. I had never heard of it before but by the time I was finished with that other review I had made the decision to make it my next read. I had only read the synopsis and not any of the other reviews and I am so very glad I did that. Going into this book blind is the best way to experience everything it has to offer.<br /><br />Everything in this book was amazing. The characters, the romance, the story, the history, the twists, the turns, the revelations... just everything.<br /><br />I have fallen in love with Linden Sky and Dean Holder. The chemistry between them is sizzling. There are a lot of special moments between these two but honestly... see, I don't even know the words to use to describe them. And the romance, wow. Let me just say right now, they experience the best first non kiss in the history of non kisses. It left me breathless. I read a lot of books and I have read a lot of romantic situations but just wow. I know I keep saying that word over and over but there is nothing else I can say. I refuse to give any of this book away in this review because I want every single person to read it for themselves so for now you will need to make do with wow and just trust me.<br /><br />Usually in my reviews I try to summarize everything but I even refuse to do that. I don't want there to be spoilers, or hints or anything of that nature. To say I was shocked more than once while reading is an understatement. As soon as something would happen I would sit and assess the situation and think 'right, okay now where do we go from here'. Then something else would happen and I would be stunned all over again. Okay, that's enough... I feel by even saying this much that I'm doing the book an injustice by saying there are shocking moments.<br /><br />My only hope is that this review has been intriguing and vague enough for everybody to be persuaded to read it. Quickly. Don't wait, push your To Be Read lists aside and read this book. My friends call me their 'Book Pusher' and in this case they will be right. I'm not usually this bossy though... see this is what an amazingly good book does to me. It makes me want to shout it from the rooftop and blast the message from my car radio while driving around the neighborhood... 'Read Hopeless as soon as possible.'<br /><br />\\"Sky, I'm not kissing you tonight but believe me when I tell you, I've never wanted to kiss a girl more. So stop thinking I'm not attracted to you because you have no idea just how much I am. You can hold my hand, you can run your fingers through my hair, you can straddle me while I feed you spaghetti, but you are not getting kissed tonight. And probably not tomorrow, either. I need this. I need to know for sure that you're feeling every single thing that I'm feeling the moment my lips touch yours. Because I want your first kiss to be the best first kiss in the history of first kisses.\\"<br /><br />Christine<br />Rainy Day Readss book away in this review because I want every single person to read it for themselves so for now you will need to make do with wow and just trust me.<br /><br />Usually in my reviews I try to summarize everything but I even refuse to do that. I don't want there to be spoilers, or hints or anything of that nature. To say I was shocked more than once while reading is an understatement. As soon as something would happen I would sit and assess the situation and think 'right, okay now where do we go from here'. Then something else would happen and I would be stunned all over again. Okay, that's enough... I feel by even saying this much that I'm doing the book an injustice by saying there are shocking moments.<br /><br />My only hope is that this review has been intriguing and vague enough for everybody to be persuaded to read it. Quickly. Don't wait, push your To Be Read lists aside and read this book. My friends call me their 'Book Pusher' and in this case they will be right. I'm not usually this bossy though... see this is what an amazingly good book does to me. It makes me want to shout it from the rooftop and blast the message from my car radio while driving around the neighborhood... 'Read Hopeless as soon as possible.'<br /><br />\\"Sky, I'm not kissing you tonight but believe me when I tell you, I've never wanted to kiss a girl more. So stop thinking I'm not attracted to you because you have no idea just how much I am. You can hold my hand, you can run your fingers through my hair, you can straddle me while I feed you spaghetti, but you are not getting kissed tonight. And probably not tomorrow, either. I need this. I need to know for sure that you're feeling every single thing that I'm feeling the moment my lips touch yours. Because I want your first kiss to be the best first kiss in the history of first kisses.\\"<br /><br />Christine<br />Rainy Day Reads
B007PKSN6Q|5.0|So this was right up my alley.  We loved the movie and i love the soundtrack as well.  I would recommend this for others.  We are pleased.
B0098VYCCE|5.0|Let me start by saying my only knowledge of the Snow White story was the Disney cartoon version I saw in the early 60's as a child. I enjoyed this movie very much (actually about 4 1/2 stars worth but there is no half option). The storyline was great and the special effects were fantastic. Charlize Theron absolutely \\"nailed it\\" as the evil character whereas Kristen Stewart was a bit \\"dry\\" as the hero, I gather she is some kind of icon in the vampire movie set but as I don't follow these films and series I am unfamiliar with her. The Dwarf's were absolutely GR-8 and I understood the role of the huntsman which I thought was a great \\"twist\\" in the classic story.Overall this was for me a pleasant watching experience and money well spent for a few hours of entertainment.
B006KX3GXO|2.0|I use this app on my Galaxy S2 daily, so when I saw it was available for Kindle Fire HD, naturally I became excited. However, upon downloading and running in use as a camera, the capture screen is upside down. No matter the orientation of the device, the images are upside down and this is not okay by me. Despite this, I gave the app 2 stars, because I know the app works great and I enjoy it... Just not on this device. If I need to change settings, please, somebody, let me know, but seeing other reviewers have mentioned this problem, I feel it is the app and not the device settings.
B0092ZEIN4|3.0|It does what it says it does. I went for this because it is small and I wanted something portable and this is defiantly portable. It is a tiny bit too small sometimes it feels like it's going to snap but it never does I've had it a month now over all I'm happy with it.
B003JBHQP4|5.0|Worked fine.  Nothing else to comment!  I usually have reserves with electronic/digital devices as I could be more computer savy to feel more comfortable.  However, this was just a connect and use device.
B00005QB42|4.0|The rhytms are kind of repeating, so when you practice yoga flow it has no character. Good for meditation, love gayatri mantra.

B00AMBLXP8|3.0|It was an alright movie.. Not as funny as I would have expected. I wish I would have waited for at least Redbox
B005FVFWOI|5.0|I had the pleasure to see them on tour celebrating this release and was more than satisfied.  This mix truly is better than the previous ones and the extras are worthwhile as well.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Awesome book! I thought the movie was great but this blows the movie to shreds! Recommend to all ages to read
B008PE9GSA|4.0|I think this brings them back more to their roots. Rubin often elicits this with his producing.  All in all a good effort.
B00AMBLDEE|3.0|I'd been looking forward to this movie, having been impressed with all of the Bourne films to date, but this one fell flat.<br /><br />It isn't just the fact that Matt Damon wasn't involved in the project - Jeremy Renner, Rachiel Weisz, Ed Norton, Stacy Keach, Albert Finney for a brief shining moment - these are some of my favorite people.  But the script limped along from the start and by the time it started to pick up the movie was over.
B006H3MIV8|4.0|Some unexpected gems from some unexpected musicians.  All in all, most of the tracks are worth listening to.  For a good cause too, so should be purchased for that reason alone.
B006YM9JSW|5.0|Well priced CPU , does what it says , can seriously be considered as a very high end CPU . 5 Stars
B008LZHA3G|4.0|Bob never disappoints.  It was one of the first CD's I listened to on a new CD player.  Recording is very well done.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|cornwell up to her usual standards of a good story. interesting plot and all the ususal characters are in play.

B004132HZS|5.0|Sherlock, in this modern version, is one of the most fun & exciting series today. Benedict Cumberbatch is fabulous as Sherlock! He has all the moves down that Jeremy Brett used and more. What a delight!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I read the reviews for this and let me take the time to say thank you everyone for not spoiling the story. I found myself totally engrossed in this book and do not doubt I will feel the same the second time around. Phenomenally relatable and thoroughly thought out. Chbosky you have another fan!!
B008476HBM|5.0|good read works on my tablet and ereader and on my notebook. good read works on my tablet and ereader and on my notebook.

B002LC2DQ4|5.0|I can take many more pictures and not have to change my card.  My memory card has added additional opportunities to take more photos and not worry about running out of space.  Great way to vacation
B003O86FMW|4.0|Hello how are you? I am good!<br />I haven't read the book yet so I don't know if it is good or not
B0016492BW|5.0|This movies is one of the best comedies made that stands the test of time, and very quotable. Highly recommended!
B0018BB20W|5.0|Classic album that has to be listened to in its entirety.  Additional tracks don't really add anything as they are demos or cover songs.
B004CLYKLI|5.0|To my great surprise, I loved this book. In particular, I adored Lily, the rebellious younger daughter who in the end defeats her Tiger Mom yet who confides that she is indeed glad that she mastered the violin that caused them to battle most fiercely.
B003Y5H5JM|5.0|dommage que se BDR ne comporte pas de vf ou vost francophone.Bonus intéressant sur la conception du film.<br />brd multizone
B008I3QZKU|4.0|I must say that I'm a huge fan of the Killers. And I actually think that this is a pretty good album. I don't understand all the hate about it. Sure there are a couple of tracks that are lackluster (\\"From Here On Out\\" is the worst offered), but overall its a pretty solid album. The top tracks are definitely \\"Miss Atomic Bomb\\" and \\"Flesh and Blood.\\" Its no Hot Fuss, but I don't think anything they do will be able to quite compete with that.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|Lots of useful interesting information nicely presented by the author. As an introvert I enjoyed it myself. I hope others like it too.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|I love this game so much especially love how you get to great the main characters and the things he or she uses
0547564651|5.0|In my school, I assign students Carol Dweck's Mindset and Malcolm Gladwell's Outliers for their summer reading, both of them instant classics dealing what it takes to be successful. I liked Paul Tough's book as much as those two or even better. He takes their discussions to the next level, packing his book with easily read relevant research, moving anecdotes, institutional case histories, and piquant biography. Artful, accessible, this is journalism at its investigative best.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I Don't get all those people who are saying that this doesn't run well on the Kindle fire, well, it runs unbelievably smooth on it! It may as well run FASTER than IOS version. What I'm trying to get to here is... STOP WHINING!!! And buy the app already!
B007V65R54|5.0|Using a variety of examples--baseball, gambling, weather, earthquakes, the stock market, climate change (not the same as weather, by the way)--Silver discusses the techniques, strengths, and limitations of prediction, especially his favored approach, known as Bayesian analysis.  You may not agree with all of it (I didn't), but he's smart and fun to read.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This novel is amazing I must say. It really gets you thinking about life,the reasons why we long to love and be love,to know and understand what is beyond us, and so on. This author did a great job of  making the reader(me) feel what each character was feeling. He gave me a vivid picture,some I did not want to see. No not because it was to graphic, but because it pushed me to levels of empathy I didn't even know i had. Yes you will cry while reading and I mean like there will be a flow of tears you will not be able to stop. There's nothing literary that I do not find pleasing in this book. The only thing that made me upset...we'll you are going to just have to read it to find out...The reason why I call this my An Imperial Infliction....when you read it you will understand why.
B00A9C3RB8|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie. I think my husband would have enjoyed it too. Particularly entertaining for those who are married. Great cast.
086571701X|5.0|I am an avid gardener and I have become pretty good at it.  We grow a good part of the produce we need for much of the year.  One day I heard about aquaponics and at first could not believe it.  After a bit of research I remained skeptical but decided to buy this book.  I am now most of the way through my second read.<br /><br />I must say that this book is tremendous.  I have gone from only hearing of aquaponics to feeling ready to design my first system.  I get it.  I understand how the fish, the plants, the bacteria, and the worms effectively cooperate to create a balanced, self-supporting, living eco-system.  I also understand my system design options.  I am reading and sketching as I go and I am so anxious to get started.  I am completely confident I can do this and I plan to use this book as a reference as I transition from designing to building to cycling to operating.<br /><br />I feel like aquaponics, with great help and insight from this book, has opened a new door in my life and I can hardly wait to step through and see where it takes me.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|liked book. kept you charged throughout story. would read it again. recommend others to read this book. all ages from teens on up will like
B003G4W49C|5.0|Very entertaining. I like science fiction titles like this book. This is a must read for any  science fiction fan.
B00AB0AXU6|4.0|I am a true fan and I really enjoyed this movie...it has all of my favorite elements since the original...including Michelle Rodriguez ;)
B009UX2YAC|3.0|It a supper fun game but it slows I pads,kindles and I pods down. I would rate it higher if that did not happen.
B004Q7DQLS|4.0|This is really a 3.5 star review.<br /><br />I'm gonna be real with you guys. Lately (try for the past three weeks) I kinda lost my Book 'O'. You know. That feeling of pleasure and contentment you get from reading an amazingly awesome book and keeps you coming back for more. Well it disappeared on me, took me about two weeks to clue in on it too. The terrible realization came when I couldn't finish Opal by the  incomparable JLA. I found myself skipping through and not even enjoying it. I know *shudders*. So. Had a moment with Kels where my brain leaked out of my ears and I had a complete and utter breakdown cuz let's face it people. No reading. No escape. Then we talked me down from the ledge it over and decided I should take a break before I get majorly burned out. So I did. Kind of. Does two days count? Anyways this is my reentry book. Now you know my mental state going into this.<br /><br />So the book. It had its moments, good and bad. I think what made good moments bad was that I went into this thinking Urban Fantasy. In actuality, it was really Paranormal Romance with a side order of Urban Fantasy. That being said, I'll start with the good.<br /><br />The dialogue. Although it did have its stale moments, it was funny, witty, and had a sprinkling of cheese, but the good kind. And I absolutely adored the world building.  Actually I would have loved it if she went even more in depth with the world and different factions and species. Harrison does it really well, and skillfully wove it into her story, which in a paranormal alternate universe is hard to do. Another thing I LOVED were the sex scenes. I feel like in some paranormal romances, especially shifter ones, it can be a bit tame. But this was wild and animalistic and I absolutely kept reading for the sex.<br /><br />Harrison also had a good set of secondaries. If you guys don't already know, one of my many biggest pet peeves with books is a lack of strong secondary characters. They take a good book and make it phenomenal. Think about your top 5 books and their secondary characters.  If you have good taste you'll see what I mean.  The last major thing I liked about her book was Dragos. Yes he was draconian at times, overbearing and ultra-alpha at others, but when it came down to it he listened to her and tried to respect her wishes. I mean for a being that's basically been in existence  since right after the Big Bang, he was pretty accommodating.<br /><br />Now for the bad.<br /><br />Pia, main character, could have had a bit more badassness going on. I know why she doesn't, due to the nature of her paranormal half, but damn in the beginning, especially with Kieth, she didn't take s*** and did what she had to survive. I can respect that. Then when she met up with Dragos, she leaned on him faster than you can say lean-to. At one point while they're literally on the run from Goblins she just completely gives up. Without a crippling wound or losing consciousness. She just tells him she's done. WTF? Dude your running for your life. Man up and keep it moving. If Dragos wasn't there you probably would have kept running instead you decide to be Leany McLeanerton and let him pick up your slack. Then some pages later she decides to reassert her independence. Sometimes it felt contrived like 'look at how cute I am asserting my independence', but at other times it felt real and kept my respect for her at a decent level.<br /><br />The two nicknames Pia had for Dragos and Rune. Though minor they jarred me out of the book. Another thing was Dragos bipolarism. Although I liked him one moment he'd be all be loving and caring, and the next he'd be coldly dismissive, and not for any real reason. I get that it's in his nature, but it was really off putting at times. Also naming a dragon Dragos? Come on!<br /><br />Now for the major question. Will I continue? Sadly, I don't think I will. The next one features her secondary set, and unless its one of those, I don't have anything to read right now why not deals, then odds are it won't be going on my to read list. And ultimately that's what really took it from a 4 star rating to a 3.5.<br /><br />If you want to read more of my reviews feel free to check out my blog pagetrotter.blogspot.comead list.

B003WUYRGI|5.0|Thank you for having this dictionary,it is very important to us as parents, knowing this kindle is being responsible and thinking about ways to help our children learn.
B005MMJ84K|1.0|So I read Pandemonium awhile ago. Right when it came out actually. I won't lie to you guys, halfway into the book I was so distraught at what Lauren Oliver did, I skipped to the end. And was enraged. I'm still angry over the wtfery that was Pandemonium. I just want to know. Am I alone on this?<br /><br />I loved Delirium. The lyrical, vivid writing. Alex. The dystopian society that considers love a disease. I mean, let's be honest, have you seen what people turn into when they're in love? Madness. The first book was amazing. Pandemonium, not so much.<br /><br />How in the world could you go from grieving for a guy you claimed to be completely in love with and who sacrificed himself for you (Alex), to falling in love with a second guy you meet out in the wilderness (Julian). How does that make any sense?!<br /><br />It doesn't. It just completely invalidates the relationship Lena had with Alex. It makes every thought, gesture, and words spoken on Lena's part seem...less. Less loyal, less real, less true, less everything. For God's sake you didn't even double check to see if he was dead. You didn't even see his dead body. You just assumed it. Why wouldn't you take 48 hours out of your measly life, for a guy you claim to love, to double check and make sure he's dead and doesn't need rescuing.<br /><br />But really, let's cut her some slack. It's not like that's happened to her before. You know, where she thought someone close to her was dead only to find out later they were alive the whole time. Oh wait.<br /><br />Anyways I'm so angry about Pandemonium, that I honestly don't think I can read the third one. Even if she ends up with Alex. It won't be the same. Lena showed her true weakness in this book, and it's one I can't overlook. I just want to know. Am I alone on this?<br /><br />To read more of my reviews please check out my profile.

B0094BB4TW|2.0|App dose not load news feed all the way and unable to like posts. Needs to be fixed if wanting to compete with other tablets on the market
B005Q1W10A|5.0|this is one of my all time favorite series, anyone thinking about buying it should go for it!  quality of the copy was very good
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|The cast works together to make a great movie.<br />Despite the large number of main characters they support each other and make it work.
B00AMBM9MO|5.0|I rented the HD streaming version of the movie.  I watched it on my Roku XS and the quality could not be beat.  Also, the movie is pretty hilarious.  If you're a fan of Seth McFarlane's work, then you'll love this.
0812993357|3.0|You could tell this memoir was written by a self-professed non-reader who isn't accustomed to introspection or using words to describe feelings. The meaty, interesting stuff in her life is covered with a sentence or two, whereas multiple pages are dedicated to describing past outfits or pet cats. I don't dispute that she has a compelling fashion vision and has led an interesting life due in part to being in the right place at the right time, but she is not the type of creative person who can put these experiences into words that connect with you as a reader. She comes off as crotchety, which may have been part of her charm in September Issue, but in her memoir this &#34;voice&#34; grows tiresome and doesn't feel totally sincere.
B008NW67E0|1.0|Poorly written and arranged music. As I grow older I can appreciate genuine quality and these guys don't have it. They are the product of an image consultant. A phony, pirate like, growl in your voice just doesn't cut it for me. Very bad, pretentious, fake intensity in the performer's voices. Pure rubbish for an unsuspecting public.
0374158460|5.0|Sprawling book that covers diverse characters and themes of American life. Even when you're laughing at the far-fetched twists and absurd touches, it still feels true. I love that he has something to say, and that despite his melancholy and somewhat pessimistic view of the world, he still has compassion for his characters. I felt simultaneously entertained and enriched reading this book.
B006M4RN3U|1.0|Another poorly engineered CD...Sound quality has NO TEXTURE and is not 3-dimensional. Very compressed, shrill, and shallow sound quality. Too bad because the group is worthy of better sound engineering and production.
030758836X|4.0|In the second half, the author really got into the head of a sociopath, and that was interesting. But toward the end, I felt like I had had enough. I was confused about the point. Were we supposed to differentiate between the husband and wife's behaviors - one a garden variety compulsive liar, the other a dangerous sociopath? Or were we supposed to think of them as two sides of the same coin? Did they deserve each other? Or was he an unwilling victim? In any event, I enjoyed it enough to finish it over 1 weekend.
1451695195|4.0|I am listening to the audio version of Dr Alexander experience of Heaven. I myself have had OBE/NDE a few times since I undergone over 13 surgeries and in my past and lived in extreme child birth like pain for 20+ years. Unfortunately, when I \\"passed over\\" it was all dark BUT I felt completely pain free and totally at peace in this altered darkness. As I seen myself approaching into my body after responding to a gentle felt loving voice \\"do you want to return\\" I stupidly said yes of course!,  Immediately i descended into my body of raging pain again because the PLEA of a home nurse trying to revive my cold clammy body and praying, \\"Please God bring him back, we need Dennis yet!\\" .....  later in that episode fully revived, all i can say oh boy, Oy Vey! back again.<br /><br />Anyway, Amen Amen To Dr Alexander for his honesty in the field of health science driven unbelievers!<br /><br />This comment \\"there is nothing you can do wrong\\"  is not troubling at all in context of his story. It does not apply while in this earthly limited vessel of flesh and blood. For us who struggle with doing what God desires by using our talents, time, and treasure ultimately for His purpose, may feel disillusioned, unloved, dry, dark, and weary of life itself. This is AN INSPIRING RAY OF HOPE FOR US WHO STRUGGLE NOW! Let us take comfort, and pray God take my disbelief, unbelief, to a viable living daily faith no matter our setbacks. May we allow his Love flow through us for the salvation of other souls who come across out path & doubt A Loving God does exist in the midst of suffering.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Typical Harry.....always a good read start to finish. I suspect Harry's daughter will follow in his foot steps. Look forward to the next generation.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Loved it!!!!!!!!  Can't wait for a sequel.  Enjoyed the storyline, graphics the way the guide was structured.  Can't wait for a sequel.
B007SGM084|5.0|Spicy and sexy and makes it okay for women to think about sex in a totally different way!  We need more like this!!!
0307887448|5.0|funbook to read with some real world issues brought up. highly recommend it to Amy one into computers even slightly
B00A0SJWQU|3.0|Great FX, hot female leads. Story and flow was just OK. Fun nods to original but not as fun a movie as the original. You don't care about the characters like you did in the original. Nor are you left wondering if it was all real or not.
B0099G3I96|4.0|I have to say I fully expected to be really less than thrilled with this cd after hearing and reading so many less than stellar reviews.  Glad I didn't listen to them.  This has a lot of really good stuff on it.  I had no intention of buying this because I think Gwen has a bit of an ego problem, but screw it.  I can't get these songs out of my head.
B004I2K4DY|5.0|I made the mistake of watching this first, and the standard was set.  Alfie Boe, Norm Lewis, and Ramin Karimioo are fabulous, fabulous, and fabulous.  The entire cast is perfect.  Even Nick Jonas as Marius grew on me.  I own the 2010 cast recording, but it does not compare.  I WISH there was a music CD for this performance so we could play it in the car.
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|I had heard it was like Glee so i was a lil put off at first but its a Great movie ! Love 'Fat Amy' she's hilarious. And I love having the digital copy to watch on my phone.
B0067RQYNW|2.0|Some features of this app are just amazing and very handy, like paragraph spacing edit tool. But I can not use it because of major issues, like I can not put pointer to previously written text to edit typos, when I try to put it in precise spot it hides keyboard and shows zoom-glass instead of it, but to pop keyboard again I have to tap screen again and pointer jumps to completely random position. When I try to add something in the middle of previously written text, it adds letter 'a' in front of any letters that I try to type, so I have to remove that stupid 'a' all the time (I type in Russian and it adds Russian a). For info I use Kindle Fire HD 7' with Swype keyboard. So 3 stats, If major issues will be fixed I'll certainly increase my rating.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|It is great for letting you know how much of everything is left. It is nice to have the info on one page as well! good work.
B009ZE27US|2.0|I think its not an accurate app I see the humorous stuff in it but it kinds ducks okay ot said im like 70 years old so yeah bye

B004JMSIRC|5.0|The beginning of the Avengers set up.  Iron Man was only $4 during black Friday and, it was shipped very quickly.
B005HS4CUY|5.0|Got this for $50+ dollars.  Before Christmas, price got up to $80.  Reason?  They are great for gifts.  Kids and adults love this movie.  The 3D is nice, but not distracting.  LIke Toy Story 3 the best.  Spanish MOde rocks.  Have fun.  Watch in 3d.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|Really good price and arrived in time for christmas.  A good buy for some one who like the Nolan batmans
B001KVZ6FW|1.0|My wife was very disappointed when she unwrapped this gift, opened the case, and found an empty case. We got the DVD case, but there was no DVD inside. Fail.
B000W93CXQ|4.0|Its an on your toes novel and keeps your head on a swivel! I would highly recommend this book to any teen reader!
0316227706|5.0|This book makes a great gift for any dog lover, and it is so reasonably priced. The pictures are hysterical, and what a great idea in general.
B0090O07RS|5.0|Many steps up from the VHS version. Necessity for super fans. Blu ray quality and greta sound, looks like it was filmed recently
B00APUYWYA|4.0|We laughed, we cried, we sang....Not really, but overall this is a good enough movie to spend family time watching...
1451695187|5.0|it was even better than I was expected. Everybody who believes in life after death should read that. he is the reall living proof of it, I believe.
B00A4YVHXQ|5.0|This combines an easy listening to Christmas tunes, no skills necessary, with simple hands on piano instruction even I could follow.
B003ODIZL6|2.0|I think this is great to have around u but how the book is set up.<br />Make at least a few pics and just put it more like like organized with some spaces so thats my review!!
B00129H7VS|5.0|I really don't know how many times i can watch this. I just watch over and over and never get sick of it. Simply fantastic!!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|A new favorite for me. Can now tell what people meant when they told me how great this is. *
B000MQ54OY|5.0|Cute movie that all ages can enjoy. My son enjoys watching, singing and dancing to every line of this movie.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|You know I was looking for a good free game and I found one this game is great I recommend it to everyone looking for a good free game
B005LAJ23A|5.0|We love the Walking Dead! Characters, writing, story lines, special effects.<br />The creators of this show are geniuses. Buy it.
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|I enjoyed this movie as it had an interesting transition for the character.  It is quite unlike the previous movies of the series.  Yes, there is all the shoot-em-up of any movie of this sort, but watching Bale's character when he was not wearing the Batman suit was the most interesting.<br /><br />On a technical note:  I do like the convenience of downloading movies to my TiVo from Amazon.  But, like most, if not all, of the other services that download or stream, the sound quality seems somewhat \\"dumbed down\\" with reduced bit rates.  And, there are not Closed Captions which I use as I miss a great deal of the dialogue.  It sounds muddy, lacks clarity and crispness, and is more focused on bass than on mid-range and treble.  I would pay extra if I could actually hear the movie without having to pause, rewind, and try to decipher the mumbling between the characters.
B009NCM248|5.0|this album is awsome. Once again corey taylor proves just how tallented he is.Can't wait for the next one. I would recommend this album to everyone. Your not going to be disappointed.
B00AMBK6J2|4.0|Oddly funny. And Mila Kunis is in it. Duh. If you're not a fan of odd humor, don't watch it if you are, watch it twice.
B008ELUEQC|5.0|She enjoys Rod Stewart and especially this CD.  We watched the TV show.  We have his great American Songbook CD.
B00APUQRPC|2.0|Don't do it, seriously. Boring , predictable, and did I mention boring and predictable.rent something else, rent anything else, fin.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|lots of laughs. I love this game. works great on both kindles. including HD. downloaded the free version and loved it so much I got the paid app.
B007I2BZIE|3.0|If care little about audio quality, read no further. The albums produced by Terry Brown sounded good! Since then, Rush albums have sounded -- to varying degrees -- a bit muddled, sometimes rather thin, and lately extremely overloaded, distorted, edgy, difficult to listen to.<br /><br />An overuse of overdubbing is partly to blame, but on this album, the dynamic range is constricted. In layman's terms, the contrast between loud and soft is very small. This means that the gut impact of bass drums, snare drums, cymbal crashes, plucks on Geddy's bass, are all blunted. With all the elements of the mix -- vocals, guitars, bass, drums, keyboards, even orchestral elements -- competing with one another at the same volume, the end result is sonically muddled. I found that turning up the volume added to the confusion.<br /><br />The only way I found I could listen to this record was to back the volume way down, to distance myself from it. Only then could I find my annoyance level, my irritation level with the onslaught of blasting sound, low enough that I could actually take in the song, the chords, the arrangement, the performances.<br /><br />In fact I started a thread on a music forum analyzing this album track by track. I found that the compositions were an improvement over Snakes & Arrows and Test For Echo. The arrangements were fine. There was a coherence in theme -- of course this was planned as a concept album, so no surprise there. In terms of their writing and performance, this is a decent Rush album.<br /><br />The recording and mixing, on the other hand, leave so much to be desired, that this is not an album I can listen to for pleasure. At low volume, I can admire the effort from afar, as it were. With the volume up, it becomes aggressive and intolerable. That's a shame. I believe the material is basically good. Of course it's only a fantasy, but I think Terry Brown could have made a sonic gourmet delight out of this homogenized digital stew.<br /><br />No doubt mine is a minority opinion, but if you've had similar reservations about the sound quality of Snakes & Arrows, Vapor Trails, and many of their live releases (R30 was an exception -- it sounds pretty good), then you will probably have a problem with Clockwork Angels as well. Approach with caution.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Loved this movie...make you want to sing even if you are tone deaf!!!  Fat Amy makes the whole movie work
B006LSZECO|5.0|Great book that keeps you hooked right from the beginning all the way to the end. Not the ending I had hoped for but good story regardless.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|as always, I enjoy John Grisham's books.  I thought it was interesting that the main character was in jail in the beginning.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|I have waited a long time for Susan Boyle to present a new CD. I am not disappoinnted. What a glorious presentation and poise. Her voice just flows like a stream of honey. I don't know why this lady wasn't noticed long before this. I look forward to her next endeavor.
B00012QM8G|5.0|This movie was well directed and well cast. Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes are superb. Although the content was tragic the outcome brought hope.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|My nephews and I enjoy doodling on the board. It gives them the abliity to explore arts and to use the software to create pictures.
B005K2YRVG|5.0|All I wanted was something to protect my paperwhite from all the other papers and books around it and to keep it dust free.<br />That is what I got...a very well made, sturdy folder that fits well, easy to pull kindle in and out and looks good.<br />No more worry if my Kindle slips off the desk it is nicely padded inside.<br />This keeps the dust off and protects from other items being placed over it...<br />What I ordered and what I got is what I needed...so do you!
B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|I read this years ago as a youth.  It is still an amazing tale.  I recommend this book for ALL ages.
B00ABXA1HI|5.0|I love this app because I have always wanted to navigate my Windows 8 laptop with touch and now I can unleash the full potential of both my laptop and my kindle fire hd! A must have!
B001BWDG0W|5.0|There were a lot of critics who found this movie to be average.  The movie was just a vehicle to use ABBA's outstanding music.  The actor's performances were very good and their music talent did not reduce the greatness of the music, but added a slightly different version.  This ablum is excellent.  If you are an ABBA fan, do yourself a favor and listen.
B003CSV7TK|5.0|I really appreciate the innocence and simplicity of the little girl, and the evolution of her mother's belief in the good points of life.  In addition, I like the movie putting the ideals of the real Christmas out there, even though it is a story of Santa Claus.  For me, the remake doesn't come close to the emotion of this one.
1250027624|5.0|I love everything about the series and I especially enjoyed the&#34;sneak peek&#34; into season 3. It's an excellent companion piece.
B009TZ7WDK|5.0|I love these two and their singing together.  I am convinced that they will revolutionize this genre of music by bringing it into the 21st century and opening up a whole new world for those who have not been exposed to it before.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book uses every emotion you have. While reading it I found myself sitting there just shocked. Everything that happened I did not expect. Great book. Great author. It's a must read.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|What is not to like  for those of us who like this genre. The characters - the settings -  the times !<br />I loved it  this much, for ,I bought several to give as gifts to those who I know would feel the same way.and would I do this again  in a heartbeat .<br />The acting was supurb. The setting were beautiful .The times from the sinking of the Titanic through World War 1 and so forth becomes alive in your eyes. I had a miserable time waiting for the next chapter and more so the nextseason
0375842209|5.0|I haven;t read the book yet but it feels great. I am listening to the audio book now. Will read through the book once the audio is finished.
B004XGN8W4|4.0|The system is nice and with great portability however it would nice to have internal connections with the game system and the unit. It leaves a lot of wires out going from the unit having two cords is cumbersome. Overall this was pretty well done!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app is great! Its really useful for my kindle fire (which it is downloaded on) because a kindle fire doesn't have a calculator already programmed in it when you buy it. DOWNLOAD this app. ;0)
0062073486|5.0|I prefer a mystery with comic relief and maybe a romance on the side and this has none of that. grim, really, but still a heck of a story. I was creeped out and did not guess who the murderer was, but then I usually don't. Christie is always able to show us fascinating characters; this time, none of them are very likable. still, I had some pity for them.
B007NZDES0|5.0|I can go on and on about this for not long after i said . one great concert, bar none. buy it.
6303122647|5.0|If you've never seen this movie you should.  It is rivetingly weird as only Tim Burton can be, but has a great story line, very unique animation, interesting music and a good moral to the story to boot.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Day dream to you hearts delight. Learn something new, be amazed at the creativity, the beauty, the wisdom or let your heart be warmed. This app is pure joy!
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I have been very satisfied with this product. It has definitely held up well and is much more protective than the box I had my camera things in for a while.
B008FDOS66|4.0|Suffice to say that I've been a Skynyrd fan for longer than I'd care to say.  While nothing will ever compare to the holy triumvirate (i.e. Pronounced, Nuthin' Fancy and Second Helping), there are indeed some gems on this record, making it absolutely worth picking up.  In fact, the song Homegrown just about jumped out of my MP3 player and smacked me upside the head...and that's saying something.  This iteration of the band isn't just going through the motions trying to keep the Skynyrd torch lit.  Rather, they're passing it from one generation to the next by making original music that is worthy of the Skynyrd brand.
B00AJIYPQ8|5.0|Supernatural is a perfect mix of comedy, drama, horror and sometimes romance.  The actors are great and each episode contains an amazing plot.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I have already read this book twice, I could not put it down each time! What most attracted me was Mr. Green 's writing. But the story itself is amazing. I cried at least 3 times. This will probably be something I'll read over and over again, such an amazing (and different) love story!
B007T9UIMA|5.0|Brilliant DVD! Great DVD for us Directioners who did not go to the Up All Night Tour!!!<br />Buy this DVD!!
B00AB0AR2U|1.0|Storyline is now, getting old.. Need new thiught process to continue franchise... They are in the White House fighting what? Ridiculousness...
B00969PR18|1.0|Round and round where will it go....beats me ,just keeps taking me in circles having one error after another. Very frustrating to keep trying and buying maps and they don't work or show in the download. I'm going to go buy a paper map now.
B003U6BE8I|5.0|aok its a gift so i didnt open yet but should be a good dvd to watch and enjoy today?
B00A0SKFLG|3.0|This was a good movie but not great. We get to see the three tits again that made us take a second look in the original movie.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|It was good!!!!!!!!!! I would tell people about it! God bless a America! A m e n ! Jesus loves you
B003IWRE3I|5.0|This movie stays with you. Beautifully dark and intense. A scary looks at what might be. . . . .
B0094BB4TW|1.0|Same as everyone else's complaint, only shows like the most recent 10 statuses, then nothing! Seems like this has been a problem for a long time! Should fix it!!
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|It's typical &#34;Male&#34; humor...crude, politically incorrect, indecent & immature yet, it's actually funny. If you are in the 35-45 age group, it'll be more relatable.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|I'm glad I waited until now to read this powerful tale of how a boy followed his Personal Legend across the desert and back.The Audible narration by Jeremy Irons is confident, bold, and imaginative. The actor inhabits and speaks the story at a cellular level, turning the written words into gold. Wonderful!
B009JBZH54|4.0|I'm not a huge Batman person... just another stupid supposed hero to me, but I thought i'd collect all. I find Bale horrible, so the enjoyment I glean from this franchise is rooting of the anti batman characters.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Where do you start with a book like this?  The characters in this book are fantastic and well written.  You get to know about them and their very real, very deep pasts as the story unfolds.  I really don't want to give away too much but lets just say that in most books I can see the plot or the ending from a mile away... not this one.  This book honestly took my breath away and more than once.  Colleen Hoover has done it again.  Amazing author and simply amazing book.
B0015AARJI|2.0|it works but someone took the usb cord out of the box and re sealed it. they thought i wouldnt notice
B0070Y46UY|4.0|This is a book to keep on my shelf.  I ordered it on my Kindle but I will be buying a hard copy!  To learn about the life of animals in a zoo and the differences of philosophy of various religions made the experience of the book enriching.  Yann Martel is an author who writes well and is not just easy to read but pleasant to read.  Without giving anything away, the ending was special and tied the whole book together which of course leaves questions that lead to discussions and this is, to me, a sign of a good book.
B000PXUA5W|5.0|My 2 year old nephew played with it for quite a while and then wore it proudly the rest of the weekend we were together. My 2 1/2 year old son was envious!
B00881VLCE|4.0|Great for hours of entertainment. I love the challenge. Can be as hard or as easy as you want it to be.
B00000F14B|5.0|This is the real Music Man. I especially liked the Buffalo Bills and there Barbershop singing.of  Lida Rose. Than there was the younger &#34;Opie&#34;, and of course Robert Preston and Shirley Jones and who can forget a younger Buddy Hacket.All in all a good transfer to DVD. I recomment itif you like musicals.
B006O3MU96|5.0|It's a fun simple game to add to you collection. For Dec 24th it's free app of the day.  The game runs without issues on my nexus 7 tablet running jellybean 4.2.1.
B001AKTZOG|5.0|This is a gift. I did not listen to it. The person wanted it so it must be good.<br />The package was very nice.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|Great film we kick off the holidays with each year. Prime shipping had it to our door in 1 day even the week before Christmas!
B00006AW2F|5.0|I did not listen to it. But, it as on the gift list. It was most wanted and the package was very nice.
B00AHSIQWE|3.0|3 generous stars, mostly because it wasn't, totally garbage but it was very boring whenever Bane was off the screen. Let's face it, we all want to see more of the famous Batman enemies. Joker was killed off but there is still plenty of cool ones. Also I'm still not sure if Anne Hathaway's character was supposed to be Catwoman or not. Just no comparison to Iron Man, Thor, Avengers or any other modern Superhero flick. Get with the times Batman.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I think this was a great book, loved it! Couldn't put it down until it was finished. I would recommend this book to everyone!
B005V4FJC4|5.0|Zooey makes \\"little st nick\\" sound adorable! I listen to it all season long. You should get it. For real.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I thought this was a great follow up to the first Crossfire in the series. I didn't want this book to end, and can't wait the next five months till the final one comes out!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is a story that will stay with you forever; it will awe you, shock you, change you and touch your soul. There are issues dealt with in this book that are very much real and highly sensitive. This book really highlights how little we know about others' lives; the challenges they face or the nightmares they've lived. Or how that for some it requires a lot of strength to go on living, and their ability to continue to smile and laugh despite everything is phenomenal. Colleen Hoover wrote an incredible book with hopeless, she touched on some very delicate subject matters in a very tasteful yet heartbreaking manner. This book is stunning; I smiled, I laughed, I swooned and I cried. It's absolutely breathtaking and cannot be missed.<br /><br />This book starts out with a touching love story. Linden Sky Davis is sarcastic, awkward, witty and strong. But she has an emptiness inside her that she doesn't quite understand. So she has meaningless relationships with many boys, but all she feels is numb. She's never before felt that burst of attraction and lust that makes you feel alive...<br /><br />And then she meets Dean Holder...<br /><br />Holder is moody, temperamental, drop-dead gorgeous and hopeless. He makes Sky feel something for the first time in her life; he gives her butterflies, and makes her nervous and lustful. But he also holds a secret, one that will turn her world upside down...<br /><br />I was totally into the story by this point, I lived it. The characters; Sky, Six, Breckin and Holder all make an excellent combination. Their all fun characters that make for a great read! And Holder, well Holder is my dream man! Ahhh he's so perfect and he says the sweetest things (I highlighted nearly everything he said). Plus his romance with Sky is just hot, hot, HOT!<br /><br />Basically this book is awesome.<br /><br />And then you hit the 60% mark... holy cow. My jaw dropped, I sat straight up in bed and I didn't lie back down until the sun was in the sky. At this point, I had moved way past living the book, I loved it. But my god! It tore me apart and broke my heart. Yet the hopeless duo, Holder and Sky, got me through and gave me a little piece of hope back. Somehow, they made me smile despite it all.<br /><br />\\"Not everyone gets a happily ever after. Life is real and sometimes it's ugly and you just have to learn how to cope.\\"<br /><br />This book is phenomenal. I only have one thing left to say - read this.point, I had moved way past living the book, I loved it. But my god! It tore me apart and broke my heart.

B007IXWKUK|5.0|I am actually re-reading this one now, it's just that good. I loved the book the first time around and thought it was a great purchase!
B003MC5N28|4.0|Well, this was an excellent read. No doing about it, this was a good story. But the end comes too quick, too fast.  it seemed like the author just wanted to wrap it up. but i still recommend this book.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I thought this book was a great ending to the trilogy! I would have loved to read more about the characters!
B00AESN8XY|2.0|I can get Plague Inc on my phone for free and the only thing to pay for is microtransactions. Why gouge Kindle users with this upfront price?
B00846REIS|5.0|I loved this book, it was a great read. I would recommend it to anyone who's looking for a little something more when they are reading. Sylvia Day knows just how to make a book come to life as you read.
B0084B5TK8|5.0|I saw the movie before I read this tale. There was so much of the book , in the movie even direct quotes. e. there was was a dark creepiness so well conveyed by the author that made the book difficult to put down.
6305882592|5.0|Some of the online reviews talk about DVD region problems and shady returns. I &#34;splurged&#34; on the $7.00 version from Amazon and not a partner and received a new in box, if ten years old movie that played perfectly.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|This is the first book I've read by this author. It was very entertaining. It grabbed me early. It was somehwot predictible, however.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|I LOVE THE GAME.  The brand new features are awesome like the monkey lab, where you can get really helpful upgrades. The different difficulty levels are nice too.  I like the new missions too.
B0084BMUFA|5.0|A great book entertaining and well written. I would definitely recommend this book. A great book to read around the holidays.
B000001GBJ|5.0|This selection of music is awesome, as well as Earth Songs.  The violin is beautiful and emotionally moving to me.

B003CSV7TK|5.0|The remakes have been good, but this is still the best &#34;Miracle on 34th Street&#34;! You don't need to wait for Christmas to see this!
B007Q0OUKS|5.0|I absolutely love both Legos and Lord if the Rings. This is one of my favorite sets! Featuring 4 Uruk-hai, two soldiers, cool weapons, a horse, and lots of goodies. It was fun putting it together, and makes a great display amongst my Lego collection.
0375413405|5.0|This is more than a classic cookbook.  It is also a hands-on practicum for the home cook who wishes to improve both skills and palate.  Rather than the standard recipe format, this book lists the ingredients in a column beside the instructs for using them.  It is both lucid and fun to read, let alone use.<br /><br />While I'm not following the front-to-back attack found in the \\"Julie & Julia\\" story, I am using it as a master class text and allowing Julia to be my mentor.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Excellent perspective of Lincoln and his rivals before becoming President ,a sometimes side of history we do not see in the writings about Lincoln.
B007VUCAVO|4.0|Handier than the little on screen icon and more useful.  Gives an estimates to when the charge will no longer be available based on usage.  instantly confirms whether the unit is being charged or not.  I've got a couple of USB  ports on cases of home built computers that aren't connected to anything and it's a helpful reminder that I've picked the right one.  As Lucy and Charlie Brown would say it aught to be $.05 but...

B0053TMP24|5.0|I enjoyed the comparison of the Greek and Roman views of myths. It left me wanting to know what happened next to the Heros! Just can't believe Hera/Juno will leave them alone. Will the 2 camps learn to get along? Talk about a disfunctional, but interesting extended family!

B009MCRHH6|5.0|Game play:<br />The game starts in Chapter 1: The Goo Filled Hills and you have a broken well with living balls of loveable goo that want to reach the old pipe. Touch the balls of goo and build a structure that they can flow up and reach the pipe. They talk they even cheer when you get the job done. Tap them and they get excited!<br /><br />Your job is to help collect the goo. Signs pop up on the landscape and you can touch them and get messages from the sign painter about the level you are playing on.The graphics are outstanding and the physics based puzzle part of the game is really good. The game objective is not always obvious and that is part of the game that keeps you trying different things to see how to win.<br /><br />Main screen:<br />* Skip level<br />* Retry<br />* Quit level<br />* OCD<br />* Resume<br /><br />What I like:<br />This game has very good graphics and a unique concept for the game and the game play. It is challenging and fun and it really makes you think during the game play. The concept is very good and creative with cute characters. This is a top notch quality game and I enjoy playing it.<br /><br />What I don't like:<br />I haven't found any issue at all in the game.<br /><br />Summary:<br />This game is the best one we have gotten yet as a FAOTD and the game play is so much fun. You are presented with some goo balls and a challenge and you have to figure out how to accomplish the goal. You get slight hints from the sign painter and that's all you get and you have to figure out how to beat the level yourself.<br /><br />The graphics and sound FX are very good and the music is nicely done. This game is one that you have to get to enjoy with your family on Christmas Day. This game is worth the $4.99 selling price and I am sure that you will enjoy playing it over and over.<br /><br />I rate this game a 5 star only because that is as high as Amazon will let me. I like it so much that it would be a 10 star rating if I could do it.<br /><br />Size: The game is 45.7 MB compressed and 48.10 uncompressed.<br /><br />Permissions:<br />* Network communications - full network access<br />* Network communication - view network state<br /><br />The app does contain Google Analytics but with these limited permissions it only is monitoring the app for software issues.<br /><br />The app installed 50.34MB into my device memory and I manually moved it to my SD card.

B0074D3CAQ|2.0|I didn't like the way we had to keep reading to find out what trauma the protagonist sufferred.  Also, the philosophical insights the character had made no sense to me. However, it had some interesting points.

B009HV2JT8|4.0|alternative history comes alive in this adaptation of some of history's great moments. the action scenes alone are worth the price alone.
B000VOC90Y|3.0|This backpack is a really good one because it has  a lot of space; however the bag itself is too heavy. I only put my laptop and a copy book and the weigh of this item hurt my back.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|Part Arthur C Clark's Rama series, part Lost, and part 1984, the Wool Omnibus (and the following two - so far - books) is a post apocalyptic epic story that is likely to became a classic, likely will become a movie franchise and probably will become the most sold sci-fi kindle book of 2012.<br /><br />Very highly recommended!
B00A7ZWUJC|4.0|bought for my wife and she liked the songs so my job was done :)<br />esp. Diamonds, love without tragedy and lost in paradise.
B004H1V5RU|5.0|This puzzle ball is a very fun and challenging self contained maze puzzle. This was a gift for my 20-year old daughter and  everybody in the house (16 - 52) has had a good time playing with it, but no one has solved it yet.<br /><br />The goal is to move the little metal ball through the fully enclosed 3D maze, while avoiding falling off the track. Each section of the track gets progressively more difficult as you advance through the maze, and some are quite deviously designed.<br /><br />Some hints:<br /><br />* It is best to play with a light source behind the ball (in front of you) since it reduces the glare<br />* Keep ball clean since it does get smudged easily<br />* Slow and steady is usually best, except on the track segments that require momentum<br /><br />It is surprising how easy it is loose track time playing this!<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />CFH
B009JBZH54|5.0|Could not have asked for more for $25...<br />- 5 blu ray discs<br />- 60 page artwork<br />- nice case not a cheap one<br />- blu-ray video and sound quality is amazing<br />- plenty of special features in dark knight and dark knight rises

B000SGSU58|4.0|Reading the books in order and in 2012, is good way to determine if a book is good enough to hold up over time.  This one was - seems a little too detailed on specifics of location at times, but still has great plot.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I was so excited to finally get to read this book. I had heard so many good things about it and the book was anything but a let down!  I purposely waited to watch the movie until I had read the book and I am so glad that I did! It was very well written and easy to get attached to the characters!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I love this app!! it helps that its free! I wouldn't pay for it; but its really nice to have!

B002SRQ214|5.0|Well I was in the market for a new computer the last few weeks because I just haven't been happy with my PC's performance playing various games, WoW, GTA4, Mass Effect 2-3. I put myself in the market because after upgrading ram, and my video card to where a few friends said I needed to be I still wasn't getting the performance I needed and wanted. I figured that just purchasing a new PC was what I needed to do bc upgrading wasn't going to be enough and I didn't want to spend the amount of money on an i7 that I could on a completely brand new pc. So once again I consulted a friend of mine who is a hardcore gamer and has built many pc's himself. He made it clear that the last thing I needed to do was not buy a new computer but to simply upgrade my cpu from the 1.6ghz factory cpu  to this wonderful Black Edition. Well easy to say it was the best thing I have ever done and the faster computer I have ever owned now, I went from 15fps in ultra in WoW to 40-60fps now, all with spending last than $200 on a cpu. I would recommend this cpu to anyone looking to do some med to high end gaming and more, I am truly impressed and amazed, its also nice to see a company like AMD putting out quality products and blowing Intel's prices away.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book really taught me a lot about kindness and how even if you don't think you are doing anything mean, you never know if you are hurting someone else.
B008JFUUQ2|2.0|I was intrigued by the rave reviews, but now realize that most must be from 16 year-old girls.  As an older male, very hard to watch (and note, I do still enjoy Glee).  Warmed over cliche after cliche.<br /><br />You've seen this movie before - it just wasn't about acapella groups.  Almost any teen comedy romp has used the same script...  I will say, there are a few good laughs (mostly coming from Rebel Wilson-excellent in Bridesmaids), but they don't make up for the hackneyed writing and stale storyline.<br /><br />Sorry folks, not for anyone expecting an actual script.  Validator: My teenage daughter thought it was great.
B009NPM5Y2|1.0|Just a big confusing mess on oddly places 80's music.  I felt bad for the songs and original singers. Don't watch this until you have finished watching all other movies.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Love this game.  Brings back many fond memories of my adolescence.  Just wish you could earn coins faster so you could play longer.
B00005JPKE|5.0|Quick delivery. Good price. Many hours of excellent viewing.. I would recommend to friends and family. Moving stories about brave U.S.Marines in WWII.
B008G59IBI|5.0|Tre has a more laid back vibe to it and it's fantastic.  Listening to Uno..Dos..Tre back to back to back you get a great perspective to where Green Day was creatively.  This album is amazing as is the whole trilogy.
0375851569|4.0|The bright pictures keeps the little infants and kids amused, and you don't have to make sense when you are reading cuz it's not like they understand anyway. Just as long as you make noise or play the radio, you can flip though the book and keep them quite for a while.
1589944607|5.0|The game says you can play 3-6 players. If possible play with at least 4. 3 player games are not that fun.<br />This is a great game and it has the total feel of the show. There are 1-2 cylons in your group and so there are several accusations going on. Some one may make a move to sabotage the fleet or they may of just made a bad choice without knowing it. The game is difficult to understand how to play at first. It took my group two games to understand what is going on and how to play the game when looking for the cylon or what to do as the cylon. If you just have one player that knows how to play it makes it a lot easier explaining everything to the new players. So it is very difficult to learn at first but the beauty of that is its that much more unique. Basic games get boring quicker vs the complicated ones.<br /><br />I have had the game for a week now and have already played 4 games. My friends and I are super addicted and can't wait to purchase an expansion
B0094BB4TW|1.0|Does not show all of news feed. Not worth downloading and going to delete it! Hopefully it will be fixed soon.<br />.
B001I7SGR8|4.0|This movie was made when directors still cared about making the impossible seem real! The story isnt up to par with one and two, but the action almost makes up for it!

B002V3OWNU|5.0|I have all of Jason's music and love it all. He has such a variety of styles that are all just his own. Hs lyrics are a crazy mix of love, life and reactions that almost everyone will find something in his music they can relate to. HIGHLY RECOMMEND San Diego's own Jason Mraz.

B002VPE1WK|5.0|i would definitely recommend it to anyone... i use it to carry my d7000 and all lenses... can fit lot of stuff and does not move at all...
B005FUTBV4|4.0|This is one creepy movie, and yes, I understood [[ASIN:B0011UF792 Dogma [Blu-ray]]]. This is a spoof of the Waco massacre, yet current affairs are intertwined with the Reverend Fred Phelps being used as the archetype for the film's bigotry-fueled, lava spewing preacher. Bible-brand, ritualistic killings of abducted teens instigates big brother to intervene, and the movie spirals into an ironic bloodbath that serves as a spiritual successor of sorts to Dogma. Kevin Smith is not afraid to experiment, and I enjoy his talent more as a serious filmmaker than cult comedian. The Rapture sequence was the cherry on top of the cake.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|It is fun and makes you think of your next move. Thought I wouldn't like it but then got hooked.
B00AE2J5HI|4.0|Critic reviews for 'Lawless' have ranged from good to mediocre, so I was expecting something similar in quality to the turkey that was [[ASIN:B002QEHPR4 Public Enemies (Special Edition) [Blu-ray]]]. Instead, I was very much surprised by the clever acting of Shia Labeouf, Guy Pearce, and Gary Oldman. The studio got it right by underselling the audience with their dull theatrical previews, which leave out the qualities of 'Lawless' that grant it a Tarantinoesque appeal. There are key parts within this movie that make the viewer recoil in disgust, something that is very difficult to pull off outside of slasher movies. Tom Hardy's portrayal of Forrest Bondurant is a bit uneven, as he overacts his role in a puerile sort of way. On the contrary, Guy Pearce's squealy filthiness as Charlie Rakes gives us one of the greatest screen villains since the 'Scorpio Killer' in [[ASIN:B00166MB6I Dirty Harry [Blu-ray]]]. Shia Labeouf injects just the right amount of sentimentalism to offset the quease-inducing violence. Gary Oldman impresses, albeit with minimal screen time. Overall, Lawless might be the best Hixploitation film ever made.
B009YP9L7U|2.0|This book was very good<br />I hope when you get the time to read it you will love it<br />So go get this book
B00283DMRA|5.0|The near perfect addition to my collection of sonics. Doesn't feel as solid as it looks, or as solid as other versions, but works great and is a lot of fun. Sorry to see that it is no longer packed with Psychic Paper. A must have for Whovians.
B00AFWEPVI|1.0|After purchasing the app through the website, it was not downloaded on to my Kindle HD. I then went to the app store and tried to download it there. I wasn't allowed and was told to find it in my apps. I shut down my Kindle Fire HD and the app was still nowhere to be found. Where is my app?????
B00797MB0O|2.0|I'm a fan of director Jason Reitman, in fact, his previous film, Up in the Air, made the very top of my Ten Best list in 2009.  Young Adult was one of my most anticipated films of 2011, and while the film is executed with fine craftsmanship, I'm afraid that the message being served with these talents is just downright socially irresponsible and off-putting to anyone with taste, class, or sense.<br /><br />I can't fault the fine performances given by Charlize Theron, Patrick Wilson, or Patton Oswald, they're all in fine form, and lend their characters believability.  Yet, all of the good will established in the first 80 minutes of the film is completely undone in what I feel is a shameful epilogue.<br /><br />There's probably an alternative way of approaching this film's closing act; one could argue that a speech delivered by Oswald's sister is simply a means of feeding Theron with the only thing she may be willing to hear, just to get her out of town and stop destroying the people in it.  And, I can see how someone could see the ending in this way.<br /><br />However, I couldn't shake the feeling that the speech was actually a means of preventing Theron's character from becoming a better person.  In this scene, Theron's character looks for all the world as a woman desperately in need of saving.  She seems sincere in her willingness to change.  And, at this point in her life, when she needs to hear something that will help her, she just winds up finding another woefully misguided soul that feeds her a bunch of crap about being better than the so-called healthy and happy people.  In fact, all of her grotesque behavior is being heralded as some sign of being exceptional, above the need for civility or mental stability because she has killer good looks and a job writing fiction.<br /><br />If Theron's character had actually been given an opportunity to change, then I might have agreed that this film honestly depicts a sociopath, but as it stands, I see it as the same B.S. message from Hollywood -- people who aren't in the limelight aren't worth a minute of your consideration.<br /><br />I hated this movie despite its technical brilliance.
B000IKHNT8|4.0|The bonus discs contain the real version of the movies. The scrolling text at the beginning of Episode IV doesn't say \\"Episode IV: A New Hope,\\" just \\"Star Wars.\\" It's even the \\"old\\" Anakin beside Kenobi and Yoda at the end of \\"Return of the Jedi,\\" not the \\"new\\" Anakin from the prequel trilogy. Especially since I largely just wanted to get a good condition version of our old VHS tapes, I was happy to find the movies here, even if I had to buy the \\"updated\\" versions, too.<br />The quality of the video might not be \\"HD pristine\\", but it's way better than our muddy VHS tapes, and on our screen they look great. Now we can actually see what's going on enough to just enjoy the story. Whether you like the light-saber battles, the weird creatures, the spaceships, or Leia's hairstyles, now you don't have to squint through the murk and guess what's going on. (Then again, maybe your VHS copies aren't as bad as ours...I can make no judgement on that.)<br />Regardless, if you're looking for an undoctored copy of the movies that have become a major American cultural icon, this is probably as good a place as any to get it. The container tin is cool, and holds the three separate cases of discs. Plus, as a sort-of \\"bonus feature\\" you get the updated versions of the movies on the \\"main feature\\" disc, if you care about that.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|Great story and am amazing character development. This series is one I highly recommend. Especially if you like historical fiction
B000L53D4O|5.0|es excelente lo recomiendo, es grande, brillante, y a los niños le gusta, mi hijo le dio rosca y rosca, es muy resistente

B009MCRHH6|5.0|I have both the pc and wii versions and had been debating this one because of the $5 price. Needless to say I was giggling when I looked on the appstore and it was free today. woohoo!!!
B00A9C3RB8|3.0|Always expecting that any film Meryl Streep is in to be fantastic, this one was just okay. Her acting is ever wonderful but  the overall somber mood throughout most of the movie was a bit too long. The character of Tommy Lee Jones was just too too negative. So would I recommend the film for a bit of *entertainment, only accompanied with a tall Tommy Collins.
B009VSW15Y|4.0|the camera was nice it was very easy to use the pictures came out very clear and I love it

0470876417|4.0|This is a very innovative book presented in an innovative way. It should never be made for Kindle I'm sad to say. The material, the photos, the graphics and of course the content make this book a must have (and must read) to anyone interested in challenging the status quo or creating a new business venture.
B006XBSAP2|5.0|came in good time well packaged exactly as ordered = happy daughter. I will be ordering music this way again
B004W2UBYW|4.0|As an admirer of Jobs and everything Apple since 1984 (first computer was an Apple IIC) I loved and enjoyed evy page I read. It was great to find out about the process behind every revolutionary success (and failure) Jobs lead.<br />I have owned most of the stuff mentioned in the book. Cried at times.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|I purchased all my daughers Christmas music requests on Amazon this year, I did look for her list on all the sites but this one was the best in price and promised delivery dates. The service lived up to my expectations when all the items arrived in a neat little box very soon after I placed my order.
140053271X|3.0|I bought a NST from Books-A-Million. LIke Amazon, B&N tries to lock readers in to purchasing from their store, but if you're resistant, it's easy to side-load books using Adobe Digital Editions or Calibre on either device. I've used both the Nook and Kindle readers and purchased the Nook ST for my personal use because I prefer to have buttons as well as the touch screen. This proved a prudent choice since the touch screen on the NST started malfunctioning about 6 months in. At first, using a Q-Tip to clean the edges of the screen worked (it's not a calibrated screen, but works using light sensors that can be blocked by dust). Then certain areas of the screen completely stopped working. I could not access my library, etc. I'll spare you the details of my four infuriating chats with B&N customer service, but I ended up returning my Nook more than two weeks ago for them to look at and replace with a functional unit. I have heard nothing about its status since.<br /><br />Compare this to the customer service I received from Amazon when our work Kindle malfunctioned -- they replaced it without a murmur, after an actual phone conversation with an actual person. I sent in the old unit and we had a new one three days later.<br /><br />I think in a lot of ways the NST is superior to the Kindle Touch -- epub format, side buttons, ability to be hacked and used as a tablet -- but if I end up having to buy another ereader, I will seriously consider converting my ebook library to mobi and purchasing a Kindle, because if (when) something goes wrong with my ereader, I want someone to care. I'm sure I'll eventually get a response from B&N and maybe a replacement Nook, but the hoop-jumping is a bummer.
1587613379|5.0|Not just for exploring a poly relationship. For it re-enforces a woman's positive view of sex, her sexual and sensual self. Because if a slut is a female that is comfortable in herself, then I am a proud slut.

B00846REIS|5.0|Ordered for a good read and was not disappointed.  I shared with my cousin and a few friends. good read
B008ASLNN2|1.0|The first movie was kinda passable - but how do you explain this follow-up disaster?<br />Robert Downey Jr and Jude Law should sue their agents, screenwriter and director for this abomination (but Downy also has himself to blame for over-acting and taking the sequel money).<br />A muddled, uninteresting and directorally over-wrought mess of a movie - the over-the-top production budget could have been far better spent against some social cause or philanthropy.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|It keeps my kindle fire protected and neatly organized.  I would order again.  Quick shippig and arrived in good sjape
B004EBUXSA|5.0|Has worked great so far, can't ask for more from a PC part.  It's been about 10 months since I installed this thing.  Hope it stays problem free for the next few years like my last intel chip.

B0092MKFIY|5.0|This album is extremely good. It is eapecially good being that it is a debut. Simply, it is great and inventive.
0307719774|5.0|I bought one for my best friend for Christmas and thought it would be fun so I bought myself one.  Started it on Christmas Eve.  I can't wait for tomorrow's question!  It is good for me too, as I am a wordy person so this makes me think before I write.  Enough space to answer the questions but I may have issues with the one word answers!! Good purchase.

B0067Q42BY|5.0|Like the story with the game. The comic book story telling gives a good transition.<br />I also like the fact that your speed helps your score.
1932907009|5.0|Save the Cat! is plainly written, very helpful. The title, while appearing whimsical, really is not. Read through and you will see just what it means. It represents a very important principle in any writing, not only for a screenplay.  I would recommend this book to anyone who is getting acquainted with screenwriting and who will appreciate the usefulness of the information for other types of writing as well. I like it a lot!
B008OOYALE|5.0|You have to have &quot;gold&quot; which you pay for more but everyone is nice and gives you stuff. This game is so adicting!!! I go on it every day. I would recommend it to anyone.

B004Q0SQ24|4.0|Wooden?  the main body is wooden, but the other parts are plastic.  I am torn about these trains.  I (and my 2yo) love the size and look of them.  However we  have several track sets (Thomas, Chuggington, and M&D).  These trains are a bit too big to go under the raised portions of the other tracks, and the magnet part is higher up than Thomas and causes the trains to derail on inclines.
B0056C6XIA|5.0|Very good, well made bit of kit. I've had leatherman, Buck knife over the last 40 years, and this is the best so far.<br />This is now about spending most money. At the price this is a seriously good piece of equipment. The addition of the torch and the fire steel just makes it so much better. I find myself using it everyday!<br /><br />This is not a toolkit on your belt, it's a collection of the most useful implements put together well.
B004Q0R7FG|4.0|Wooden?  the main body is wooden, but the other parts are plastic.  I am torn about these trains.  I (and my 2yo) love the size and look of them.  However we  have several track sets (Thomas, Chuggington, and M&D).  These trains are a bit too big to go under the raised portions of the other tracks, and the magnet part is higher up than Thomas and causes the trains to derail on inclines.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|Beautifully written, held my attention, one of  the best books I've read this year. Can't wait to read more by this author.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great game does not use real money so its okay there's a lot of games u can unlock by playing other games adictive game but fun!!!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this teaser. My problemi is, I like to hit the sack before 11:00PM, but if I have started Free Flow, I usually add another hour to my &#34;up&#34; time.
B000VDUWMC|5.0|This is the best fact-based work about where we come from, how societies developed and why we've turned out the way we have that I have ever read.  The author is so knowledgeable and at the same time even-handed in his assumptions.  It's quite a lenghty read, but one of the best and most rewarding you'll ever find.
B009LK6JS2|3.0|I can't really evaluate this program as I still in training.<br /><br />It will probably be awhile before I can land on a carrier.
B00821PCJS|4.0|I watched seasons 1 & 2 in the span of one week. I hadn't researched the show in the slightest, I simply decided to take a chance after noticing I had missed out on some sci-fi that looked promising. I'm glad I didn't read the negative reviews before watching; it is now clear that many of these folks didn't watch the full season... or perhaps they expected a serial of the caliber of Battlestar Galactica (2004). Falling Skies has carved out its own niche, and has not copied any show in recent memory. The comparison to ABC's &#34;V&#34; (2009) is valid in theory because both are about alien invasions--but really they are nothing alike. &#34;V&#34; ran on the premise of an accident waiting to happen, whereas the worst has already happened in Falling Skies.<br /><br />In the post-apocalyptic world of Falling Skies, you are left with an insurgency that is about equal to what you might expect from a ragtag group of civilians who are lucky enough to have a military Captain, a physician, and a hodgepodge of skill sets in the mix; after the apocalypse, even criminals have a shot at becoming valued members of the gang. And a gang is what the survivors become, just as Captain Lee 'Apollo' Adama suggests in BSG during the trial of Gaius Baltar: &#34;...we're not a civilization anymore. We are a gang, and we are on the run, and we have to fight to survive.&#34; Yet the group of known survivors in Falling Skies is vastly smaller than in BSG; it is closer to (although a fair bit larger than) that of our heroes in The Walking Dead, a post-apocalyptic show with many similarities. By the end of Falling Skies Season 2, our heroes are beyond being just a gang... the sentiment is closer to what Glenn expresses in The Walking Dead as he is digging graves for the casualties his group suffers in the episode Say the Word: &#34;they were family.&#34;<br /><br />They make mistakes, yes, but given that they live in a new world that is only an echo of the civilization that they lost very recently, I wouldn't expect smooth sailing. Unfortunately for them, they need to learn the hard way what works and what doesn't. We are there to experience this along with them, including down to the level of father with sons. I agree with another reviewer that it is refreshing to see the pragmatic and non-confrontational relationship between the leading father and his eldest son. Although the characters can sometimes be annoying, this can be said to add to the realism of the show rather than detracting from the viewing experience.<br /><br />Overall, this doesn't quite make 5 stars. The script often isn't tight, and sometimes I get the feeling that I've seen the same thing somewhere else (much of sci-fi seems familiar if you watch enough of it). It doesn't really grab you from the start... it is more of an evolution of good television as the seasons progress. To all the haters: Season 2 has some nice twists (you are missing out if you quit prematurely).
B0094BB4TW|1.0|Only loads first ten posts or so. All of Facebook's apps are bad. I can't believe they can't make a decent one.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I feel like playing this game makes me smarter. Not sure if it actually does, but I /feel/ smarter.<br />There are so many levels to this game and they keep getting more and more challenging. For such a simple concept it has a great design, interesting game play, lots and lots of different levels, And is something you learn to play in a matter of seconds
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love Love Love this site.  I'm completely and totally addicted!  I have found so many wonderful ideas and recipes on this site and look forward to more.
B005636HPS|4.0|This is a fun album. We danced to a few songs at my cousin's wedding, play it at parties for filler music. Definitely and upper
0385535147|3.0|A pretty good quick read, a bit better than some of his recent book, however, not as good as his earlier work.
B008KGPEQG|5.0|Beautifully written. I enjoyed the  subtle humor. It was  a thoroughly enjoyable and even, at times, illuminating read - often  easy to identify  with.
B009MCRHH6|4.0|I do suggest that people get it it is really good!  but takes a long time to download but worth it!
B002NXOQF2|5.0|I read this for the first time 34 years ago, and have to re-read every so often.  A great adventure story.  And though Mr. Adams says it was never meant to be any kind of allegory, it's a great character study: the natural leader, the mystic, the intellectual, the storyteller, the right hand man.... their all hear in perfect rabbit form.<br />Yes, the rabbits are anthropomorphized - but in such a balanced and believable way, it only enhances the magjic of the story.<br />No one should go through life without experiencing this book!  You'll never look at rabbits - or other animals - the same way again.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|I was a little disappointed in the end as far as Talia Al Ghul was concerned, but overall this was a good addition to the Batman saga. I wonder if there will be a new trilogy.
B007JCP8FE|5.0|Honestly, I bought the album for one song -- Bully -- because Tom Wallace made an excellent arrangement for band.  As I listened to the rest of the album I enjoyed what I heard.  There is a real craft to their music.
B0084IG7KC|4.0|It was a little over hyped, but a pretty good movie. The whole family enjoyed it. I would recommend it to friends.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|Products was as described, great way to have a catch up day on missed episodes. Recommend this products for anyones DVD collection
B0001ARCFA|5.0|I ordered these headphones as a Christmas present for myself, and they are everything that previous reviews have mentioned. They are very comfortable and have a great sound. The headphones are fairly large but still look good<br /><br />Pros:<br />Accurate mids and highs<br />Decent bass<br />comfortable ear pads (because of the semi-open design, they seem to float on your ears instead of clamp to your head)<br />large head band reduces pressure points on head<br /><br />Cons:<br />Bass is a bit muddy<br />Ear pads become a bit hot (but nothing bad enough I would take them off)<br />A bit quite (I have read they require an amp to get full sound quality)<br />Interesting sound stage. However I like how they sound so not a problem<br /><br />In conclusion, these are a very good starter headphone for those who want to upgrade their music listening. They have a &#34;warm&#34; sound to them, which in my opinion makes genres like jazz sound even better. You will not be disappointed with this headphones.
B0007MWZEK|2.0|Sweeper worked O.K. the first few days.  When I put the sweeper over my trash can and opened the door on the bottom to empty sweeper, the unit with the door on the bottom fell off unbeknownest to me.  The next time I used it, there was nothing to hold the dirt as I vacuumed the floors.  Since I didn't know when it fell off, I had no way to send back to manufacturer.  I have had two of these units for 3 years and know how they work.  They work great on hard floors and are quick and easy.

B00AHSMDQY|4.0|Great movie, very entertaining, Anne Hathaway is best Cat Woman of all the Batman movies and a good close for this Batman series.

B009GYSQV6|5.0|First of all i LOVE Crystal Castles!<br /><br />This third album took me by surprise for it was a little bit different from their previous two BUT as artist they have to change up their sounds just a bit.<br /><br />No complaints here.<br /><br />This album is beautiful and soothing with a tad bit of energy.<br /><br />Im looking forward to album 4.
B00AHSIQWE|2.0|dissapointing. was expecting better. glad i didn't spend money on a movie ticket and it only cost me $1.99 Raquel
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|I've been using Evernote to sync my 3 work computers, my phone and my Kindle for over a year and I love it!  I never have  to worry about  not having info at home because  it's at school and vice versa.  However, I am concerned about the invasive  permissions.  So far I haven't seen any negative outcomes from it ...yet.  Hopefully, there won't be any.
B0098VXBIA|4.0|Great movie! Found it verry funny and very true to life.. everything i felt when i was pregnant. Definately a must see .. whether you are pregnant or not.
B006O3MU96|2.0|I had never played the regular version of Doodle Jump, so I can only review this style of game. It get's pretty boring pretty fast. For free it's not a bad game, but I would never party money for it.
B009CGYO0K|2.0|This is not compatible for the kindle paperwhite.  It will not load stating not compatible...... Very disappointed.  I can see it on my Iphone Kindle.  But very small........
B005K17RU0|1.0|This app is always running from the moment I boot.  If you're constantly checking the weather, it wouldn't be so bad.  If you're like me, and only checking once every few days, then this app is a waste.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|This app is pretty good and works well on the kindle fire, graphics are good too.<br />It does have some slight issues with suggested times for how long the battery will last for certain programs though, but generally pretty good.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Good game. Ads are intrusive but they have a skip button and choice of options.free so you cant complain too much
0066620996|5.0|I really loved this book because it not only made perfect sense for a company or a company leader in designing a future, it illustrated many real-life examples that supported the books themes.  Perhaps the most enlightening was the simple, yet fierce adherence to a few basic principles that one must carry to go from Good to  Great!
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|It was the best book ever but at some parts it got a little boring I read it all in one day and that day was today on Christmas on my new kindle fire :-D
B009AY04A8|3.0|I'm liking the game so far....a good mix of puzzles....wish load time between scenes/puzzles was faster.  Looking forward to more
B0098VYCCE|3.0|A lot of the themes are mediocre reproductions from better films such as Lord of the Rings. There's not much that's memorable here. I found myself wishing for the end about an hour into it. Still, not a bad film - there is some entertainment value in the scenery. Also, there is no way that Kristen Stewart is more \\"fair\\" than Charlize Theron.  The entire theme if the movie is pretty darn laughable because of that casting choice alone.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|BEST GAME EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I love this thing BEST GAME EVER SINCE 6:30 (witch was 12 min ago) yay-y yay yay-y yay
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I absolutely love this series! The story behind is so awesome a little intense sometimes, but it's a must if you like a good romance!
B009YU62H2|5.0|If you are a fan of soundgarden and the 90's grunge era then you wont be disappointed by this latest offering
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I never thought I could love a book as much as I love Colleen Hoover's first novel, Slammed. Guess I was wrong! Hopeless is everything I ever wanted in a novel; lots of romance, no teen angst, a great plot, lovable characters and plentiful twists. Sky was the all-time perfect protagonist, and Holder? We need boys like him in this world. Plain and simple. Both characters showed just..RAW emotion, I felt like I WAS Sky and I found myself connecting with her on an extremely personal level. The dialogue was GREAT, not cheesy or over-done or under-done. The plot was fantastic, and Colleen Hoover managed to keep up a charming romance throughout the whole story, despite the plot twists. I loved how Sky and Holder never questioned how one another felt; There was so much going on in the plot that if they HAD gone through the typical climactic character-break-up, the book wouldn't have been as realistic. I'm blown away at the talent this author shows! WARNING: If you buy this book, be prepared to stay up all night and read it. It took me 6 consecutive hours to finish it, and I already can't wait to read it again. Colleen Hoover is an author to watch out for, because she'll steal your heart with nothing more than a few words. Hopeless is the best book I've read in a while, I recommend it to everybody! Best $3.99 I've ever spent.
B002BWP49M|5.0|I bought this as a christmas gift for someone who really likes these movies I myself am not a fan and am not qualified to give it a proper review since ive never even watched it
B009YG2ND8|5.0|As a fan of the series, i am very pleased with this app! i hope other titles will follow soon.
B0072KZ0Z6|5.0|This was a gift for my girlfriend but this was a no brainer since she loves this show. I myself am not a fan.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|One if the best movies I've ever seen.  And to think it's a true story.  Great cast all around.  I highley recommend this movie.
B00A12VW86|4.0|I am a huge fan of the band so this is a totally biased rating. If your a fan of the band you are sure to atleast like a few of the songs on this one. While songs like nightlife and amy are a bit different than their regular stuff they offer something different that makes this album stand out among the trilogy.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|Great way to edit n it's free n doesn't force close...plus it looks natural and not so fake like other editors
B009329ZF2|2.0|Seen transformers.... any transformers... this is a low budget version of that... skip it. there was very little here to enjoy or even talk about.<br /><br />boats...<br />Aliens... i think?<br />bad acting!
B008NW67E0|4.0|As a suspect many people can relate I became a huge fan of Mumford & Sons after hearing Little Lion Man for the first time. I then went and purchased their first album and loved it. While this is also a great album it doesn't quite compare to their debut.<br /><br />I personally find that Babel doesn't have the same emotional effect as Sigh No More (their first album). As a whole Babel seems to fit together very well but the songs blend into each other. After listening to it for a little while there aren't any songs that stand out in the same way that The Cave and Little Lion Man did from Sigh No More.<br /><br />While I still recommend this album to anyone who is a fan of Mumford and Sons I hope that their next album does more than this.
B008Z9YLV2|3.0|Yes it was a good movie. No it was not as good as the book. But we knew that before we ever watched it right?
B004OZZ624|5.0|My husband and I were tired from the holidays and decided to give this a try. Yes it is slow in the beginning, but it really does make up for it the rest of the movie. My husband kept saying his heart would not stop beating fast. I found myself on the edge of my seat. Excellent action/suspense movie.
B00A0SKFLG|4.0|Good acting<br />Easy to follow plot<br />eye candy<br /><br />Nothing shocking as far as &#34;wow didn't see that coming&#34; just a good action flick that follows the success formula &#34;boobs, guns, explosions&#34;
B007HACDLK|5.0|If you like Vince Flynn Books, and I sure do, you're sure to be satisfied with this book. I've read every Mitch Rapp Book he's written and have come to really appreciate this man's talent.<br />vince flynn-- none better!
0736092269|5.0|If you’re a nerd like me who likes to know as much as possible when you are dedicated to something as important such as fitness, then this book is for you! I know I just sounded like an info-mercial, but this book really is a great reference with tons of detail into the anatomy of your workout. The artist/author do a really good job detailing to the tiniest muscles that are being used on specific routines, how to perform those workouts, and the causes of some injuries that can/will occur if done incorrectly. Highly recommend this!

B004RJMUJO|5.0|This game is awesome. It kind of goes without saying, after so many reviews, but I wanted to add my approval to that of virtually everyone else. This game is fun.
B008JFUUIA|1.0|I saw this movie in theaters with my mother and my sister. I thought this movie would be funny but it is lame. It is all comedy with no real plot. The vomit jokes are juvenile. I have seen one minute youtube videos that are funnier than this. There are plenty of better comedy movies to watch.
B000022TSY|3.0|good movie just thought it whould be better but i guess that it was great for its time 3 out of 5
0767824571|5.0|first of the &#34;good&#34; movie  big theater for Monty Python fans ( i did not like &#34;jabberwacky---sorry to fans of that one ) --- very funny take on the ARTHUR legend
B005LAIHRC|3.0|Movie was good but there are a few spots in the movie where the movie is not working right, it shuffles then plays fine.
B000VE439Y|5.0|if you are easily offended and hold religion as a sacred cow - DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE this movie skewers all things religious and sacred to hilarious effect ---fun if you like this type of blasphomy
B0094BB4TW|1.0|The worst, ever!  I've only been using it an hour, and hate it already. It reminds me of FB for android before the latest update. When I try to &quot;like&quot; something, it removes the &quot;like&quot;.  It only shows a few stories on the page. Don't waste your time!!!
B000002U9L|5.0|if you loves the movie the soundtrack is a must ---tho have to admit the songs took abit to get used to ( have to like david bowie ) but the instrumentals ---awesome
B004ADH1RI|5.0|Simply Awesome , This movie made me a movie geek when I was 8. Foundation set for loving Pirates, Hobbits, and all manner of freeks and geeks.
B007K3JFUQ|5.0|a great return to the &#34;new holmes&#34; tho darker and more sinister than the first -a great movie --there is less of the voice over and  &#34; holmes -vision&#34;
B005ZCXPP0|5.0|I love the retro look to this movie, the director also directed the Rocketeer and  I loved the style of that movie. I like how this movie brings together the foundation of the Avengers.
B0038M2AZA|5.0|I bought this movie based on a recommendation from a friend because my niece is autistic.  It is an excellent movie in itself, besides the fact that it helped me better understand autism as well as how my niece's thinking process is.  I loved this movie and it was very moving, inspiring, and beautifully done.  I bought the movie for my brother to share with his family as well simply because I was amazed at what Temple Grandin has accomplished in her life with autism.
B00AMBK0X4|3.0|it is a move that futures a kids toy but it does not ac like it i use the shock comedy but that is ben used too much so it is copy cat
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Interesting twists and turns. Loved having to wait in lines during the holidays, just reading my Kindle iPhone.<br />Never wanted to put it down.
1451627289|5.0|This book is great, and not typical Steven King. I have to add 11 more words, or I can't review this, so here it is.
B00AMBLDEE|4.0|lots of action but it took a while for the story to unfold but once it got going it was pretty good.
B004LWZWGK|1.0|This review has nothing to do with the actual movie, the actors, the director, the story, etc.  It has everything to do with the actual Blu Ray disc set.<br /><br />I received this for Christmas to round out the trilogy (we own the other two Dark Knight movies on Blu Ray as well).  There seems to be a problem with the transfer.  The movie starts out in full widescreen, with Letterbox black bands on top and bottom (for the record, we have a one year old Samsung LED 1080p HDTV).  However, early in the movie it suddenly switches from from the Letterboxed wide screen to full frame. Then it goes back to Letterbox.  This proceeds to happen back and forth throughout the movie, making it nearly unwatchable (not really, but I think you're getting the gist).<br /><br />At first I thought it might be something to do with my Blu Ray DVD player, which is a 3 year old LG model.  However, I did put the disc into another Blu Ray player that was purchased at Christmas and the same thing occurred.<br /><br />I'm not normally one to give a low review to products on Amazon that I feel are just a defective anomoly, as I know things do happen.  I try not to assume that the product is generally \\"bad\\", especially when it can be exchanged.  However, I wanted to see if this is something that others are experiencing on their particular version of the movie.<br /><br />I'm going to return the Blu Ray for a replacement and see if this was just an anomoly with the particular disc that was received.  I will update if this is fixed with the replacement.
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|PURE GENIUS !!! , that all i got to say.  Love this album . Love Bruno... His best CD to date .
B0019NG7HW|5.0|I was promised a &#34;like-new&#34;product and that's what I got. A bit dusty, but plays clean and even - no skips, scratches, or off-key slides like my older, thinner record. I love Queen. I am by no means a music snob - I have some really bad-quality MP3 recordings that would make some people cringe - but I do like to listen to songs on the medium that they were recorded for. This does happen to mean records sometimes! But this was never made into a CD, this version, so...<br />But yes, exactly as promised, great quality, good sound!
B00AHSIQWE|3.0|movie was too long and did not like the story.  Good thing I did not see it in the theater.
B007V5CF5K|4.0|Using some creative ideas on solving techniques, this game creates a puzzle that is unlike the usual dark themes of most adventures. Catchy tune and good graphics.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I love being able to tell that my kindle fire has x number if hours of battery life remaining. great app
B006DHAT5K|3.0|I really thought I was going to hate this movie.  The trailers made it look like one of the year's worst films, and I was prepared to add it to my list of The Worst Films of 2011.  The truth is that I was pleasantly surprised by the movie and am happy to report that I smiled more often than I scowled, chuckled more often than I groaned, and actually felt satisfied when it all ended.  After all of the nasty, so-called artsy fare I've sat through lately, a movie like What's Your Number was refreshing, if only because it was so upbeat and cheerful.  Yes, it's cliched, and if you don't see the ending coming, you haven't been watching enough movies; but, when a film contains such good will, what's the harm in kicking back and enjoying it?
B0039TD7PY|5.0|This is a wonderful CD / DVD & it was nice to see them back together again.  Great collection for anyone.
B0040HO01Y|5.0|We love this show! Such great characters and story line. I'm sad that it was cancelled... but then at least the show can't be ruined !<br />Highly reccomend for a good family show with a good plot that everyone can enjoy together.
B0042VJ1PI|4.0|I loved this book. I usually read his books during the summer waiting for the new season of Castle to start.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|I didnt read or watch anything that had to do with these books or the movie at the time they came out because i didnt think i would be interested in them but i got bored so i decided to read them. Not bad.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|Sharp Objects, by Gillian Flynn. It has not quite the complexity of Gone Girl, but stunning lead character and excellent plotting.
B008K3HRF0|5.0|my 10 year old son (9 when we purchased) loves this movie! it's totally age appropriate and adorable for this age group!
030758836X|5.0|Gone Girl is beautiful. It is elegantly written, and it is full of stunning twists and surprises. The two main characters are beautifully rendered. I'm unsure about the ending -- but it was interesting enough to have launched a number of conversations with my friends.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I included this in my best of the year list......and I'm a librarian!  I felt like I knew Pat and his mom.  I wanted to call them when the novel was over to see how things were going.  Anyone who has ever been mislabeled will especially love.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I like this game. to me its kinda a downgraded version of temple run. also does anyone love Beatrice Miller? I do!!!!!!!
0671449028|5.0|My kids love this book.  I started reading it to them when they were little and now many years later they still love it!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Good, light read. Started around noon and couldn't put it down. Make sure your significant other is close by for later!
B005LAIH4A|5.0|Our kids loved this movie.  The Dvd was great.  Would definitely recommend this to families looking for a good movie to watch.
B007SGM084|5.0|Yes..Yes..Yes..great page turner, keep me reading and reading could not put it down , to eat or sleep through all three books.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I completely enjoyed this game and it was so typical of the high quality G5 produces!  Can't wait to play the next one! Keep them coming :)
B005I6EU7U|5.0|Nuff said. =)<br /><br />Ok, I guess that wasn't long enough. Insert longer version: My wife loves the case I picked out for her Kindle Fire.<br /><br />I myself find it to be a little annoying when I am trying to watch a movie, as there is no stand, but my wife doesn't need that. She only uses the kindle to read and play games similar to sudoku.
B00AJRQLTI|3.0|As everyone reading this probably knows, this particular movie musical was revolutionary because unlike most movie musicals the singing was live rather than recorded separately, mastered, and then put on top of the video. On screen, this effect took a little getting used to but it was overall very well done and seemed a lot more real and authentic.<br /><br />On MP3, it doesn't sound great. It sounds unmastered, too soft, and kind of restrained. I really wish they would have done a mastered studio recording for the soundtrack instead of playing the audio from the movie, which just doesn't work without the visuals.<br /><br />So overall, even though I love the actors who sang for this version, I'd recommend buying one of the Broadway cast recordings if you want better audio.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|I purchased this book on the Kindle app for iPad. I was a super easy to setup and I have enjoyed reading about the life of Steve Jobs.
B000ZM1MGE|5.0|Excellent movie, very realistic, a must have if you like classic good movies for your collection or a good one for a start.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|Great CD.  Love all the songs on it.  If you are a fan of Taylor Swift's other albums, you won't be disappointed.
B0068FYZIO|5.0|A very good movie, if you are a collector of good ones this is a must to have, also the special presentation for Universal Anniversary is a Plus for this movie.
B00AMBM9MO|1.0|This movie is a waste of good talent and money. It promotes the use of illegal drugs and poor relationships to the youth of this country. The produces of this movie should look to their own children ask themselves, Is this a lifestyle I would like them to acquire.
B0041KVZ1I|5.0|Ok, so I have seen mixed reviews on these vinyl reissues. I got Abbey Road and Sgt Peppers on Vinyl for Christmas. Abbey Road pressing is perfect, no static or pops. Sgt Peppers however was poppy and hissy. I had to clean it. I do not think you should have to clean brand new vinyl, especially brand new modern pressings. By the way, my turntable is brand new too. So 5 stars for Abbey Road, 4 stars for Peppers cause of  the poor pressing. ( I guess was one of the lucky ones for Abbey Road, it was flawless.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I have always loved games like this, and even though I'm not a kid I was very into this game .
B005HSL626|5.0|My kids play this game and they love it.  It works great on their kindle fire.  Glad it was free.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Some of the games are hard but it does get addicted. Minus one star for the difficulty level of a few of the games. I would recommend this to friends.
B0030MM68O|5.0|Great movie! Shows how soldiers live out in the field of duty with danger all around, relations with other peers, different types of dangerous jobs they encounter, & understanding why its hard for them to sometimes live their lives normally when they come back home. But they always stick out the worst everyday. Shows people how to appreciate them for their services to this country.
B004YM6JI2|5.0|love the show- love that the season was on sale for $10- rave reviews for amazon and the show!!!  Wish Id had the moeny to buy a whole second set.
B009NQKPUW|2.0|Don't see why aliens was attatched to this movie to explain in how it started. Effects were good but never the less, it was not impressive. Great thing this was a rental.
098555780X|5.0|Instructions are easy to read and follow.  My husband has had a great time making bracelets for the Grandkids. Fun
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|Liked the main characters roll in being a part of royalty but chooses not to have it. Didn't get the story line a bit but it made sense at the end.<br /><br />Loved the effects and the comedy in the movie. Brought lots of laughs to the kids.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|Cute movie worth viewing.  Good music. Predictable outcome, but entertaining. Only drawback was the streaming had to buffer a few times.
B0090EHVMC|4.0|Great movie for family & it teaches kids not to be too greedy or consequences will occur when you don't expect it.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|great kids presentation<br />enjoyed by kids and grand kids<br />lots of excitement for kids with many questins and observations<br />well done
030758836X|1.0|Was totally confused by this book.  Made it to the end and still didn't get it. Gone girl was a waste of time.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|love colleen...loved this book. couldn't put it down.characters were real and raw.<br />thanks for the best read i've had in years.
B008XCPO2Q|2.0|Great looking bodies and good dancing, but the story was weak and boring. Actors gave it their best shot...and butts!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book challenged many pretenses set upon youth in society. It makes you think and wonder if you're truly living your life the way you should be. Very interesting and worth the read. Now I just want to see the movie. I hope it can compare to the book!
B005QUQ99K|5.0|Didn't realize it but my oldest son had this so my youngest got it for Christmas. Best of both worlds...
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|The 7th installment of the Diary Of A Wimpy Kid series is full of laughs as Greg Heffley tries to find a date for the school dance. I RECCOMEND this book to,kids ages 8_11. Being 13, I still find humor in this series of books. This book is a good way to wrap up the year with a laugh.
B0083IMAR2|5.0|I gave my grandson this book for his third birthday.  He loves it and likes to read it often.  Perfect book for a family vacation by air.
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|I really do like this game. Hey if we can have angry birds we can have bad piggies rite. If you agree like my review. Like me.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Fabulous book. Well written description and an easy read. I would highly recommend this book to anyone questioning the existence of heaven.

B008D19WBQ|5.0|So all I see are the reviews of complaining kids.  If you really love this show and the DVDs so much then have both because these episodes are NOT CUT they are the BROADCAST episodes, you know the way we fell in with them.  And if all you know is the dvds then watch this anyhow and quit your belly aching because now you have the chance to see them the way the world did.  Good Lord people can complain.
B004WKH4PS|5.0|Joan Crawford at her best.  Great acting, very good story, well done production.  Great vintage movie which was filmed and directed very well.
0062202081|5.0|I just bought this book, expecting it to be annoyingly similar to Justin's first autobiography. I must say that I was pleasantly surprised. While First Step 2 Forever tells an overview of his story along with some backround details, Just Getting Started focuses more on this inner feelings while on tour. I felt that he really connected and put part of himself into this book. I found parts very emotional, and enjoyed the humorous parts immensely. I recommend this book for anyone. It is very inspirational and definitely not just for obsessed fans.<br /><br />WARNING: Justin DOES get a little religious in parts of this book. It wasn't enough to make me uncomfortable (in fact, I respect him for his openness about his faith), but he does mention God quite a lot. It is obvious that he looks up to Him for most everything. However, he does not get an anyway 'preachy' about his religion. There is no force in what he says.
B004BEMC6G|5.0|Great movie...lots of action...kept my attention!  Love it -<br />Angelina at her best.  I could watch it again and again.
B003TSEEDY|3.0|This book was definitely not what I was expecting. I still founding interesting but it wasn't my cup of tea.
B003P9VZ0W|4.0|Grand-daughter loves her Princess decals.  Easy to install and reposition.  Do not ask me to say more than I want too!
B003ODIZL6|3.0|This book is very useful but kind of complicated when it comes down to the last words rather have another book than this book
B0076DCT2G|4.0|It was nice to see John Corey back to his smart ass self and the story was very good. Slightly predicable but a good read.
1606869736|5.0|I read the book back in High school, never got to finish in class. So I desided to read it on my own. So few years later I wanted to have the books.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|After a couple of weak stories (comparative to earlier books) Clancy is back on top with a real thriller that is reminiscent of what made him one of my favorite authors.
B009LXEBD4|5.0|A perfect CD of all her hits. I was very happy to hear her newest hit is on the CD.
B009GEAPYW|3.0|I liked the graphic novel decades ago, and this captures some of the feel...perhaps not quite as darkly brilliant as I remember the source material.  It was good enough that I'll at least watch part 2, but may try to rent it.
B0079R8KO0|5.0|The price and quality was just right. My son was very happy with the product. 5 more words to complete
B0076DCT2G|3.0|I have always enjoyed the attitude of John Corey and the repartee between John and Kate; however, in The Panther, these are taken to the extreme.  Little happens throughout the first half of the book other than the banter.  The action is too little too late.
B009J2VR3Y|5.0|She was very happy to receive the CD. However, she had no idea it was from me, nothing was indicated in the shipping instructions.
B00A6PD9I4|3.0|The audio was clear and crisp, but the video seemed over-compressed. (and it was streaming at the highest quality permitted, to pc's)
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|This is a great app for people who are used to using Professional Office.  Wonderful product.  I plan to get lots of use from it.
B002PEP4SC|4.0|Read it because I love the TV show. Liked it, enjoyed it, but haven't rushed to buy anymore. Maybe watching Nathan Fillion ruined me--I guess I'd rather watch the stories than read them.
B004SIIBGU|3.0|I can find what I want, but the font size is too small.  It's a bit difficult to navigate.Could use an improved version.
0446554995|4.0|I love the Pendergast books and wish Hollywood would get on the ball and start making movies of them. The plots are always complex, the characters likable and the plots tight. While this one had all the usual great components, I was left a bit confused about a couple of things.<br /><br />I don't want to spoil the plot for anyone, though, so how to review without doing that?<br /><br />Maybe I'll say this instead: read it, enjoy it and let it go at that.<br /><br />And yes, I'm already looking forward to the next one.
B008K6DU4Y|1.0|I have tried many times but it will not play for me or work with the game it said to download MX Player in order for it to work.
B002JVWR4A|5.0|Bones is simply a great show. It's entertaining, frequently thought-provoking and has characters with enough warts to make me like them.<br />The fifth season didn't disappoint as their relationship gets more and more complex and begins to reach a pivotal point. If you're a fan, don't hesitate to add this to your collection.
B007N5YIUS|3.0|My grandsons play it sometimes but the 6 year old finds it hard and frustrating.  I think the original is better.
B003L77G2Y|5.0|Although the current and last season of Fringe is trying my patience, every other season was intriguing and mind-boggling. The third fits perfectly in that category. It keeps you wanting more and trying to decipher all the complexities--those of plot as well as of character. John Noble is perfect.
B009NQKPUW|5.0|I thought Prometheus was a very well done movie. This movie is one that you have to be paying close attention or you'll miss important subtleties. I like the way everything was tied together.
B007MS5B6Q|5.0|The packaging is a great conversation starter.  Everyone who see's it....love's it!  A great addition to any &#34;Walking Dead&#34; fan.
B0086700CM|5.0|it is a great game. the best...........  n  n n n n  n  n n n n nn n n n nnn nnn
B000SEGUDE|3.0|Some kind of cross between LOST and Atlas Shrugged I suppose...but left many gaps even after a second read.  Some of the characters seemed forced...
B008C40218|5.0|I'm a big fan of Calexico, and this CD is really something. Soft, melodic, with a catchy tune, everything you can expect from them. Great album.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|this game is great the storyline is interesting. all the g5 games ive played have been worth it. I would give this game 5 stars!
B003Y5HWJU|4.0|I've always enjoyed Buscemi, but he doesn't seem able to carry off being a godfather character very well. His acting seems stilted. Maybe he just requires the Cohen brothers level of direction. Love the period. Jimmy Carmody character is complex and fun to watch ... in fact all the characters are great. Too bad about Buscemi. I'll keep going. Maybe he gets better.
B008RA3X5E|1.0|Didn't wake me at all. I tried multiple times. I was soooo pissed at this app. Not worth 0.99 cents.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|I saw this in the movie theater and knew i had to buy it when it came out.  I loved it.  Inspiring, informative, funny.
B009ZZDNT6|1.0|I got this thinking it would work wonders but boy was I wrong. Don't bother!!! It is not worth the trouble.
B004EPYZZ8|5.0|I love any movie that has to do with sports and is based on a true story.  Great story line.  Inspiring.  Loved it.
B00A4YVHXQ|3.0|The sound had trouble at first, but once it started working, it was fun.  Only like three songs, but different levels- enough to make it interesting.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Excellent read, I definitely recommend this book. I could feel all the emotions the characters were going through. I loved this book
B004XGN8W4|4.0|While the product overall is pretty sweet, when playing games with dark settings its nearly impossible to see unless you change the settings for every other game! plus there is always a glare even in dark.
B00APUQH0W|4.0|The movie was a typical Eastwood tough guy, tender heart but no expression of his feelings except separating.  Nice performance by AmyAdams.  The movie honors the personal touch.
B0062OCNAI|1.0|I was very disappointed in this book. I only finished it because I am one of those people who has to finish a book once I start it, even if I don't like it. I struggled to read it after the first chapter. I did not like the fact that the whole book was written from the main characters point, with her trying to solve the crime even though she was in a coma and her character was \\"floating outside her body\\" and able to have conversations with her daughter who was also \\"outside her damaged body\\". Based on this book, I will not be reading this author again any time soon, if ever.
B006BGZJJ4|4.0|I like the adaptor but had to wait about a month to recieve it. It made it very easy to down load stuff to my kindle fire.
0307352145|4.0|This book is really a nice read and although I am not finished it certainly is healthier than some of the negative ways I've been taught to consider myself. Quite a useful explanation of introversion. My husband saw her speak at a conference when he was traveling and seemed to gain a few insights into what he has thought of as my pathologies. So I ordered the book to read surprised that he had some different perspectives. I'm afraid introversion is often seen in that deficit light ( I've been told everything from \\"stop being a victim\\" to \\"put your shoulders back\\" to platitudes about positive thoughts and the importance of \\"making a new friend a day\\") and she is quite good at talking about those issues. Just the part on Dale Carnegie made me feel better for I think that way. I detest the strategies imposed upon my teaching in the \\"Kagan\\" et al models of how to structure \\"group work\\"-clearly as we run around making noises so based in extroversion,  which for a certain number of children is nothing more than an awful invasion of personal space-and for me a violation of my being. Now I have a book to put out for others-who would never read it-to consider another perspective. I'd order it for about 50 people if I could. And I think I will send to my father who definitely was disappointed in the person he got, someone who wasn't good at about everything he insisted upon.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I personally found Catching Fire to be more interesting than The Hunger Games (and Mockingjay). It may be possible that it was because I saw the first film, then read all three books, so it was more novel than the first book, but I think there were some real improvements in this book (spoilers ahead):<br /><br />*The Hunger Games themselves were more interesting. The arena wasn't just a generic forest, but instead was a diverse area with a lot of interesting hazards. The danger is more intense and it triggers some important character development.<br />*The characters are more two dimensional. Gale is more than just &#34;that guy in the background who maybe likes Katniss&#34; and Haymitch is more than just &#34;the drunk who is actually pretty smart&#34;. In particular, the competitors from the Career districts are shown to be more than just cold-hearted killers.<br />*The political consequences of Katniss' rebellion in the first book are fleshed out. The end of the The Hunger Games had vague warnings from Haymitch about the consequences of what she did, but they seemed abstract and, in honesty, pretty harmless. Here they actually mean something.<br /><br />Overall, I found it much deeper and more enjoyable. Catching Fire is The Empire Strikes Back of the Hunger Games trilogy.
B002RVCD6O|5.0|No additional features or extras, which I'm perfectly fine with. I just wanted the movie to watch. I got the fullscreen edition because I like to utilize the fullscreen of my tv instead of just the middle part which is widescreen.
B009WO7NQO|1.0|I'm confused why u have to pay 3 dollars for this when its a dollar on amazon.com.  I'm also confused why it's free on anything BUT the kindle. a good game. but amazon is going cheap.
B004XDYJRU|4.0|It has everything like the free app.But i has the ability to record your show just like a DVR for you tv is now for your radio app.A simple, very easy to use app now with a \\"DVR\\" option to record your shows and listen to them anywhere you want without a wifi connection for 99 cents more.Is it worth it,you decide that.
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|this was fun yet challenging, scenes were innovative and definitely was a bit of holiday, festive fun. Free access made it even better!
B008N1V11U|2.0|I got this game on sale for 99 cents and I'm glad I did because this isn't worth 7 dollars, not even close.The game is a replica of Christopher Nolan's movie of the same title.You control Batman and you fight the evil Bane and get seduced by Cat woman and punch many pixels worth of people.The graphics are decent at best, the character voice acting is atrocious,gameplay is all over the gameplay is all over the place and yes like any Gameloft game there are frequent glitches and freezes in mid-action.I cant really comment on the plot because its just copying the movie so I would have to bash the movie but I like the movie very much so i wont do that.But overall,the game is overrated and frankly pretty awful.<br /><br />Pros:Decent plot and the just being Batman,getting to use his vehicles and gadgets are all pretty cool to do.But not without a price and frustration and grief.<br /><br />Cons:All over the place camera angles,glitches,mis jointed gameplay,the same guys you fight over and over again,no clear objectives on what you must complete missions,no instructions on how to do things for example, using Batman's car and motorcycle was a pain in the neck and when i needed to hack into devices i was completely baffled and lost because there wasn't a tutorial.Awful voice acting and a repetitive use of clee-shays  .So many glitches and freezes right in the middle of flying around or fighting the \\"bad guys\\".<br /><br />Overall:Another bad Gameloft game and I'm not even Gameloft hater.I like their Modern Combat series but everything else they have mad in my opinion ,is average or sub-par.And not worth 7 dollars.Its a 99 cent game which its right now on Amazon.But its on sale.<br />I dont like it,and i wouldn't advice you to get it either.
B00AMBK0X4|3.0|A few laughs, emphisis on few.  Sam Jones was funny, the bear had a few te he's here and there, but that was about it.
145210655X|5.0|My 33 y.o. son, who is a long-time Star Wars collector, loved this book.  He immediately read  the entire book.  He thoroughly enjoyed this book.
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|There are two types of  movies; kids movies and adult movies.  There is no shortage of either, but to find a kids film that adults can enjoy is rare.  This is one of them, right up there with the better Pixar films.
B001706I5I|5.0|The kids loved hanging out with the Grinch while I finished getting ready for our Christmas Eve celebration. I earned credits with Amazon Prime so they watched it for free! Double plus!
B009NQKXYK|3.0|A near miss, sad but this could have been a great sic fi flick.  Still, you should see it, it didn't suck but the narrative was whisper thin and barely worth the effort.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it is so fun!  I love playing and learning how to do the games! me and my friend are in love with this game!
B00992CF6W|5.0|although i don't really get the point of this game, my 6 and 8 year old boys love it! they spend hours \\"crafting\\" (their word) things. basically building houses/buildings and their interiors. i guess it's like electronic legos??? my boys love legos and love minecraft.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|A book for the lost young souls. Officially my favorite book (and probably because it's the last book I've read...)
B009D5VPTI|5.0|This was my first full-length video purchase on Amazon Instant Video. The video runs smoothly with a great picture. As for the movie, it is very entertaining and my daughter loves it.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book is the best. It made me laugh and both cry. It was so cute. And I liked the way all the characters looked at things. One of the best books I've read.
0316228532|4.0|Liked it, didn't love it. Wickedly difficult to get through--way too many characters too soon, POV changed often and abruptly, and no plot to speak of, really. This book took months to read instead of the hours or days that I can finish epic fantasies or classic novels.<br /><br />The people of Pagford and their stories are realistic and intriguing, but to what end, I'm not certain. The excessive vulgarity and violence in the book felt to me, unnecessary. Classified as British Humor & Satire, I expected something more like \\"The Englishman Who Went Up A Hill But Came Down A Mountain\\" so a disappointment, to say the least.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|My kids got this movie as a Christmas gift~  We love this family friendly movie, great for everyone, love it~
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|It's awesome you need to read this book because it is a great one to me. So please read lol
030758836X|5.0|great deal at christmas.. dirty santa gift here i come! read the reviews and the synopsis seems to be very interesting i will wait till the person who got it gets done and let you know how it is!!
030758836X|4.0|I have read all three of her books.  They have great twists and keep you on your toes.  I will read more when she releases them.
B00AMBLDEE|5.0|Maybe call it &#34;Cross Purposes&#34;  or in combo with Matt Damon called &#34;Bourne Again: Cross Purposes&#34;.  LOL<br /><br />In all seriousness, whether alone or with Matt Damon any film backed by the same producers and writers with the wonderful Jeremy Renner would have to be great.  Jeremy Renner is definitely on my &#34;must see&#34; list no matter what film he's in.
B0013FBS20|4.0|The book is a movie about \\"vampires\\". The creatures in the movie are something entirely different. The core premise is similar in that there is one man left after a virus wipes out most of the population. The movie also doesn't do a very good job of setting up what happened along the way to getting everyone killed and/or infected. The book does a much better job. I saw the movie first and wondered why the book is so hyped. After reading the book I wish the movie adaptation had been closer to the original story.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game you get to change people unlock different things you get to run,run,run! while creatures are chaseing you best game ever I just want to keep playing.
B00AB0AR2U|2.0|I expected more. Watching this movie was like watching someone playing the video game. No real storyline. Even the fight scenes were dumbed down. Wasn't even scary. Don't waste your time or money on this one.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|Gives full access/view to the files and directories on my Kindle Fire and allows me to keep organized or transfer between my pc and my fire as needed.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|Daughter lovessssss LPS was so excited to see they had an app! I can almost never get my kindle out of her hands now!
B009B4ZEMU|5.0|OMG... The Best Album To Come Out This Year ! I Dont Care What Anyone Says! Definitely Worth The Money.<br />Good Job. -Claps-<br /><br />#TeamChristina
B005J29HD0|4.0|Nearly perfect. the only caveat I have is that I know that there are stereo versions of these songs available which sound superior from the out-takes I've heard. Why on earth Capitol records would not put out a stereo version I can't fanthom unless there planning on a future release and just testing the waters here. There's more money to be made boys.
B001UDPAB0|5.0|Movies were a good price. Wish I would have wated and got the blu ray for the same price at Christmass. All an all I am pleased.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|Good functional version on my Kindle tablet works fine when I need it. Much better than the flash player which tends to crash too much.
B0086700CM|2.0|it very fun when u first get it and then it frozen. u can get it but I would not get it on my kindle fire.
B002RSDW80|5.0|Julia Child changed the way I cook and eat, but--more important--she changed the way Americans generally cook and eat. This film provided a delightful way to get to know her personal side, and Meryl Street did a terrific job of bringing her to life on the big screen.
B006CQLGXG|5.0|This is a story everyone should read.  Dickens' words are sweet, witty and highly descriptive.  Many movies can convey the overall story but omit so many beautiful details.  The pictures do the story proud.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|My husband downloaded it for his kindle. I only put it on mine to see what the fuss was over. It's a stupid little repetitive game that is completely addicting. I have to admit, I find myself playing it every day, which is a little embarrassing considering I was teasing my husband for playing it so often.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|It took me awhile to adjust to the protagonists's unusual way of thinking and speaking.  But, it was worth the read.  The book tells the story of mental illness in a simple, funny way.  It explores the relationships between people who are struggling to understand and help someone they love who is not well.  There are sad moments, as expected, but there are many happy experiences for the central characters as well.
068981528X|5.0|This is a seriously funny kids story.  I was a little disappointed in the ending, but it is so funny we read it multiple times whenever we pull it off the shelf.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|This is a great read. It was hard to put down because I wanted to know what would happen next.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Loved it.  Funny but also interesting.  Kept me laughing, crying, and smiling.  It was one of the best books I've read recently.
B001P06GX4|1.0|Okay - I ordered Blokus for a Christmas present for an 8 year old.  I did not order The strategy Game (capitalization exactly as shown on box) made in China with numerous spelling errors, punctuation gaffes and just overall unattractive, substandard packaging.  I have to say I will give the 'educational component' 5 stars because not only would this be a logic game it is also a lesson in grammar, phonics and spelling.  Amazon - if you are selling something under a particular brand/name, make sure your vendors are following through and delivering what you advertise.  Just shaking the box, it sounds chintzy and of low quality versus the game I found in the retail stores in my area.  This will go back.
B002JXICCY|5.0|This is a much watch for any fan of Rock and Roll.  One of the best bands ever (and Kennedy Award winner this year) this doc remains one of the best ever for a band.  Be sure and read about it before you watch so you can watch for certain things like &#34;concert shots&#34; that were recreated.  Just a fantastic doc with killer music.
0634049011|5.0|Good exercises. Well thought out. I am working slowly thru the material but the theory has helped my playing. Highly recommended if you are serious about playing guitar with finesse.
B0090OW7J4|4.0|His best in quite a while.  Would like to hear him rocking some more but this IS John Hiatt at his best
B00APUYWYA|4.0|It was a lighthearted and fun movie. It was well worth the cost of the rental. If you are a Glee fan, you will probably like Pitch Perfect.
B009RI4ZKC|5.0|It's a quirky gem of a movie.  Many layers to it that beg this movie to be re-watched.  Very enjoyable and priced right for rental thru Amazon
B009VLX8FS|5.0|Love it! Wasn't so sure but for $1.99 on sale it was worth trying and it hit a part of me that truly enjoyed it.
B007T99ENE|3.0|Not up to Ian McEwans usual standard. I felt it was rushed out for Christmas and I didn't like the historical facts all the time, too much padding. His characters usually get under my skin and stay there, but not this time. Looking forward to the next book though, sure it will be better than this one.
0399230033|5.0|this is an excellent board book for toddlers.  Cute illustrations that allows the parent to engage the child in the book
B00382S9N2|5.0|My mother loved it. It's worth the price that is giving. You get a book with information in it and pictures and with extra footage.
0316069434|2.0|Another reviewer echoed my thoughts. Time frame very confusing from riots in 90s to present. Also, Connelly is usually much more adept with the reader by providing twists and turns in the plot. It was not a stretch to figure out  who was responsible in this cold case. I hung in there even though I knew who was responsible to understand the motive, even though that strained credulity and  was a stretch.  Don't think in real life he would ever get away with his insubordination. Wouldn't it be better to have him in charge of the squad and mentor and/or push the men/women to solve homicides? Bring in Mickey Haller and some of the old crew?<br /><br />Love Bosch, but this fell flat after waiting a year. Is it time for Harry to go private detective? Perhaps Maddie is too young to be that proficient with guns, simulators, and driving. Let her be normal and have some real friends. Happy this time he didn't feel the need to explain every police acronym or bore us with in depth explanations of terms. Readers are well versed with all the nomenclature from TV shows. Harry needs a make over!!!!!!

B00AGE20ZI|5.0|One of my favorite Christmas movies, I have watched it every year. Still a classic film with a wonderful cast. They can remake it over and over this will always be my favorite
B005NPCJ88|5.0|a great album that was good start to finish .. dont listen if you want to go to sleep because you wont
B00846F1YW|4.0|This game keeps you wanting more to see what happens next. I read previous reviews...I hope mine doesn't freeze up or get stuck.
B008FTAAG2|5.0|blood<br />was a very good purchase with music well worth listening too. a plus on this album ..= = = =
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book was awesome. I read it seven times and I still was amused. If you have a chance this book would be a great choice.
B009AZZEU2|5.0|I've been a longtime SG fan and was excited to hear them reunite and tour. I was even more excited to hear a new album was coming out. With that, you're always nervous that time will take its toll and that maybe the band would try and cater to a different sound. Not so in my opinion on this album. It seems to pick up right where they left off and doesn't miss a beat. The more I listened to this album the more I liked it. Tracks like Taree, Black Saturday, Been Away Too Long, and Worse Dreams had a unique sound but still echoed Soundgarden.<br />Now hopefully they tour some more!
B008YRVW0I|4.0|I like puzzles they work your brain and this game to me is fun and relaxing. I would recommend this game.
0307272702|5.0|Very simple put:  Cut out carbs, go through withdrawals, switch to fat burn, burn fat as a primary fuel source, lose all the weight you want (mostly fat)...then, either up your fat intake to stop weight loss and maintain, or very cautiously add back carbs to see what you can tolerate.  Very simple, right?  Wrong.  That is, if you're the additive type, which we all are.  A person's only weapon against the tortuous and potentially painful period called ketoadaption, is education.  What are you doing, and why are you doing it?  What specific tasks are you doing to accomplish your goals?  If you don't know the science of how to lose weight, you're never going to reach your goals.  That much we know.  But even if you know that low carb works, the retention rate would be low, because the transitional pains of ketoadaption would be too great to justify what you are doing.  So to repeat, if you know the technology of what you're going through and why you're going through it, it will increase your chances of reaching your goal, despite it's probable symptoms, and if you don't know what or why you're doing something, the changes of your success is almost nill.  Unless of course you are insane, a masochist, who loves pain for it's own sake.  I know I don't.  Read Gary's book, to help you stay the course.  And if or when you get lost (which you will),  there are many videos of Gary and others on the web to get you back on tract.  My one recommendation, is that when you are in the ketoadaption phase, have glucotabs with you at all times.  In your car, pocket, bathroom, near your bed, and in your bag.  These tabs, which contain 4 grams of glucose, will stem the very unpleasant symptoms of hypoglcemia.  You can get them anywhere, like Riteaid or CVS.  They're cheap.  But, be careful, they taste like candy.  Best of luck to everyone.  Leave me any comments you desire.<br /><br />Thanks for reading,<br /><br />Michael Stillman RN, CPT
B00ARAO0WM|4.0|This movie had some good cycling scenes, story line was a bit predictable!the acting was good and some innovative ways of filming urban cycling!
B00AMBGGS2|5.0|I love this movie. I have recommend it to family. Who doesn't love Clint Eastwood, even when he talks to empty chairs :)
B005UA0FLE|5.0|The music is very classic, traditional Christmas music. Who better than Michael Buble? His voice is like one from back in the 50's singing these songs for the first time... Absolutely wonderful!!
B009GENZKS|3.0|Resident Evil-Damnation(released Sept/12)is another computer generated animated Resident Evil entry,which I thought had a lot of potential,but just didn't come up to snuff in so far as the executing of its plot in an efficient and timely manner,was concerned.<br />This time around we find an American agent,Leon,dropped into the eastern Slav republic to verify the presence of BOWS or bio organic weaponry against its citizens.This section of Europe has been under siege for years.First its citizenry were uprising against the government.Then the government,backed by big business(the Umbrella Corp),has decided to take back what the rebels gained.Umbrella is playing both sides against each other by supplying bio weaponry to all.The rebels gain access to Las Plagas,which can enhance the energy of its user and can also be used to control the Lickers,the ones who crawl on all fours and have long tongues.The government also has that capability but also have the use of a super-soldier of sorts,that they hold off using until the time is right.<br />The female leader of the Slav republic wants desperately to become a member of the UN but cannot get that sanction until the on going hostilities are resolved satisfactorily.Ada Wong appears acting as an emissary to the president,but she is really working for herself and is there to retrieve a Las Plagas sample for people unknown.When her cover is blown Ada will battle the president and her aide and flee,running into Leon and assisting him sporadically throughout.Leon,in the meantime will join up with the rebels in their battles with the government and learn more about what and who controls Las Plagas.At one point Leon tries to beat and recover the injecting fluid and needles of Las Plagas,but will be beaten there by the rebel leader who will inject himself with it.<br />Leon will witness the up close and personal placing of a large Las Plagas entity,down the throat of an unfortunate soldier,he will battle The Lickers,then he,with the rebel leaders help and control of the Lickers,do the final battle with large Tyrants,who are large super soldiers,about 10-12 ft.tall,and impervious to most regular forms of deterrents.In fact as two Tyrants rush Leon,an American jet appears overhead and takes them both out with smart missiles.<br />The film ends as Leon watches the news about the Russian-American take over of the Slav Republic.We also see Ada holding a large Las Plagas creature in a tube,and talking about whether or not she will in fact hand the creature over.<br />I found the plot poorly executed,and as much as I delighted in seeing all these new creatures and methods of infections,it wasn't enough to offset the boredom created.The film is certainly true to its game roots though,in look and feel.Leon moves cautiously through empty garages,warehouses etc.,while you get the feel that you should have a game controller in your hand as his flashlight pierces the darkness.The CG graphics are also excellent.Some may find this a bit absurd,but I found the lips sometimes out of sync with the voices.I know this is animation,but RE-Degeneration was much more realistic in that respect.If there hadn't been so much slow time,and it had moved more like its predecessor RE-Regeneration,this film would have been a winner.<br />The film is in its w/s a/r of 1:78:1 and is clear and crisp.Extras include a gag reel,commentaries and featurettes.<br />All in all a disappointing CG animated entry in the Resident Evil canon.It had great potential but its' meandering and stop and go plot,hindered it greatly.It's graphics are excellent but its not enough to give this film any better than a mediocre mark.e rebel leaders help and control of the Lickers,do

B009MO5960|4.0|Resident Evil: Retribution is the fifth film of the Resident Evil franchise.  Unfortunately, it continues in the path of the fourth film and further reduces the importance of plot; it now has only the minimum amount of plot and character development necessary to move the action forward.  This is really disappointing considering the first three films actually had substance and characters the viewer could actually begin to care about.  Side characters are now introduced and discarded without even trying to garner any emotional response from the viewer.  However, the movie is basically non-stop action, very intense action.  It definitely leaves nothing wanting in that regard.  I would have to give the movie a 3/5 rating.<br /><br />While the movie itself leaves the viewer wanting more, the Blu Ray transfer will leave everyone satisfied.  It may be the finest Blu Ray transfer I've ever seen.  Unlike previous Blu Rays in the franchise, blacks are inky black throughout, whites are nice and bright.  Crush is never an issue either, giving the film a very natural and intense contrast.  Colors are nicely saturated and rich, with the overall color tone being a little cool.  There is an absolutely striking amount of fine detail, more than I would have thought possible out of 1080p resolution.  There is no grain or noise present.  The 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio soundtrack is also spectacular.  All channels are fully utilized throughout, including the subwoofer.  The soundstage consistently envelopes the audience.  It has great dynamic range and with the right setup will shake the walls, yet everything remains clear.  Easily a 5/5 rating for the Blu Ray.<br /><br />Averaging out 3/5 for the movie and 5/5 for the Blu Ray leads to an overall 4/5 rating.  If you are a fan of the zombie action genre or the Resident Evil franchise in particular, I highly recommend this Blu Ray.  If you aren't necessarily a fan of the genre and don't really concern yourself with how good any particular Blu Ray looks, you should probably pass on this film.  If you are somewhere in between, then I hope I've given you a good idea of what to expect.
B00AB0AR2U|4.0|Resident Evil-Retribution(released Sept/12)stars everyone's fave kick butt babe,Milla Jovovich,as Alice.She's back this time in a wonderful non stop romp that,I think,is about on an equal par with the first one,that first introduced us all to this bizarre world.Milla is in top form and there are alot of former stars/characters back to reprise their roles and give the film an even bigger boost.<br />The film starts out where the last left off,on board the ship full of refugees with incoming VTOLs.The film starts with a twist,by having Milla thrust into the water and going down,then reversing the action/film until the point at which we see just why she landed in the water(being thrown over by a crash landing VTOL).<br />She wakes up in a suburban environment where she is married and has a deaf child.As they have their breakfast they are attacked by zombies and all but the daughter(who hides)are killed.Milla next wakes up in an Umbrella Corp.facility and is being questioned from an observation room by her old friend Jill Valentine(Sienna Guillory),who is being controlled through a spider like device implanted on her chest.Suddenly the controlling computer system goes into restart and the doors to her chamber open.She escapes into a controlled environment of the city of Tokyo and a simulation is run by the computer.Surviving that she comes into the control room to find everyone of the techs shot.As she examines a firearms cache,Ada Wong(Li Bingbing)joins her.Then her old nemesis Albert Wesker(Shawn Roberts)comes up on monitors.It seems Ada is working for him and neither belong to the Umbrella Corp.,who are planning to take over the Earth.Wesker believes the only chance the planet has of survival is with Milla's help.At the moment they are in an old expanded USSR submarine pen facility far below the surface in eastern Russia.The Umbrella Corp.has created several different simulated environments to test their human-like creations reactions to their bio hazard creations.Milla,with Ada's help,must travel through these environments and meet up with the rescue team.<br />As Ada and Milla work their way through a New York simulation the rescue team arrives and are on their way down to enter the Moscow simulation.There they are set upon by zombie soldiers.Milla and Ada finally team up with the rescue group and they make their way slowly back to the elevators.Before they can all get moving the power quits.The Red Queen,the facility controlling computer entity from the first film,now controls the entire Umbrella Corp.,and tries to stop the rescue in earnest.Jill,along with other controlled people,are there to stop Milla and the group also.Added to this is a giant Licker who grabs Milla's deaf daughter and whom Milla will take time to retrieve.Finally the group,lessened by a couple of deaths,reaches the surface and awaits their helicopter rescue.Explosives,the group left behind,are detonated and the complex below implodes.<br />A sub from below breaks through the ice and Jill and Rain(Michelle Rodriguez)emerge with Ada in custody.The two men left,battle Rain,who dispatches both,and Milla barely survives her fight by removing the spider like controller on her chest.Milla battles Rain and is losing badly when she spots a zombie just below the ice's surface.As Rain stands in one spot Milla fires her machine gun in a circle around her,which drops her into the water,and the zombies take care of her.<br />The rescue helicopter arrives and whisks Milla,Ada,Jill and Milla's deaf \\"daughter\\" to the White house.There in the president's chair sits Wesker.He injects her with the controlling Las Plagas parasites,enhancing her abilities to their former glory.Wesker says she will need it in the upcoming battle against the Umbrella Corp.and its hordes of T-Virus infected mutants.<br />This film is off and running from the first frame and never stops.The special effects,the fight sequences and CGI are all top notch,along with a good and swift moving plot.Milla is always a delight as Alice and her stunt work and fighting skills are all on display throughout.She is ably assisted,as I mentioned earlier,by several stars from the earlier films in this franchise.The only part one might question,as far as continuity goes,is Wesker's appearance,who I thought got blown up in a VTOL fleeing the ship last time out.<br />Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:40:1 and is clear and crisp.Extras abound here with deleted scenes,outtakes,commentaries,and featurettes.<br />All in all one of the best of the Resident Evil films so far.The action just flies from one scene to another and Milla is at her RE best throughout.This film can be seen by those who have followed the series from the start or are new to it.Highly Recommended.4-4 1/2 stars.a is always a delight as Alice and her stunt work and fighting skills are all on display throughout.She is

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|A little gorge but beautiful in every way :) I really think Suzanne Collins out did herself  and I can not wait until the movie
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The walking dead is great!! the best show if you love zombiesss... I definitly can not get enough of the walking dead!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game and the missions it requires of you to pass it makes me want to continue to play
B006GWO5NE|5.0|I somehow managed to lose my original cable--lost it on vacation. So I am am glad the new cable charges up my Kindle just as well.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Always accurate and has come in handy multiple times. Also nice to see what the weather is like for family even if they are in another country! Highly recommend
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I love mahjong anyway, but this game adds an element of adventure. The tiles change according to where you go on the map.<br />Love it!
B0028MBKVG|5.0|I had listened to the audio book first, but I knew I had missed some things.  I then read the book, and was so glad I did. It was so well written and so easy to read.  It is truly a game changer. It introduced natural running to the masses.  No more high heeled running shoes.  Run as your body was designed.  It has lots of great stories.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This game is fun you might have just began playing and think&quot;Oh this is easy!&quot; well not really after you play for a while you might get stuck i did im on level 13 8x8 my cousin said she will help me since she just passed the level but overal if you love challenges this is right for you. Enjoy!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This really is a great app! So good in fact I will purchase the full version right after I write the review.
B007FRHZ4A|1.0|I agree with all of the other one star reviews. Great concept, HORRIBLE execution. towers even frustrating for an adult to build due to the thin and uneven sides of the rectangles. We will keep this set for the launcher, pigs and birds only, to launch at their other castles etc. The rest will be going in the trash.
0740748475|5.0|A whole lot has already been said about this book, so I'll keep it brief. I absolutely love this ultimate C&H collection! My only nit with these 3 books is the binding, which could have been sturdier. But, I now have all my favorite comics at one place and cannot give it anything less than 5 stars.
B005LAII3A|4.0|I enjoyed this movie....great remake!! Action packed & good special effects! I would recommend this movie for people that enjoy action movies!
B0007KS7D0|4.0|I love the quality of images that this adapter makes possible. I have a little concern about the snap-on universal adapter that comes with it coming off my main lens, so I've purchased a step-down ring which allows me to screw this securely to me lens. With that in place, it's excellent.<br /><br />The threads at the end toward the camera body are 46mm in diameter.<br />The ones at the other side, closest to the subject, are 49mm in diameter.<br /><br />I went ahead and got screw-on lens covers for both sides, to keep it safe when not in use. It does come with slide-on covers, but I want more confidence that the lens will be protected.
B00936A0RU|3.0|I thought this looked like a great movie, but when I finally got around to watching it, I was pretty disappointed. I had a very hard time getting in to the movie.
B0098VYCCE|4.0|Charlize Theron made an excellent evil queen. The movie itself was depicted gorgeously. While I thought I would not like the movie because I did not (and still really don't) buy Stewart performance as Snow White, Theron's performance and the beautiful cinematography made up for the poor casting of the lead role..
B00AJRQLTI|3.0|It's pretty good but not full songs, but then again it is titled Highlights. But I love the music so there ya have it.
B009AJD5E0|4.0|IF you are an Alien fan AND a Scott fan, this is definitely a very good movie to have in your library.
B008RYN44U|2.0|When I seen the music video for Settle Down - I was excited because No Doubt had reunited for another cd, but half-way through the video I turned the channel. I should have stuck with my gut feeling but I bought the cd anway.. I think the Black Friday price helped with the decision..<br /><br />I listened to this cd twice just to make sure I wasn't quick to judge it - but I was right the first time.... Blah!! The feeling I get from the cd is - Hey Guys.. Let's fulfill this contract obligation & throw out one more cd or... Hey Guys! We need some of that tour money - let's compile some B-side songs and release a cd.<br /><br />I'm a No Doubt fan but there's definitely no doubt I'm not feeling this new cd.
B00355L2TU|5.0|Love Jillian's workout dvds. I've had the 30 day shred for a couple of months now and definitely see a huge difference in regards to toning in my midsection and legs. This was so great I purchased more of her dvds!
B003HARV3Y|5.0|This is a great movie that has been very hard to find in local stores to purchase as well as to rent.Great find. It is so nice to know that hard to find items are always available on here.
B00AMBK0X4|5.0|This movie was great! Heard a lot of people say it was funny so I had to give in and rent it. Glad I did!
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|very well priced and a nice gift - would order from Amazon again for this type of product for a gift or myself.
B00APUQJLO|2.0|I have followed David Cronenberg's films from \\"Shivers\\" (and \\"Stereo\\" & \\"Crimes of the Future\\") on and he is certainly one of my most admired writer/directors.  \\"Videodrome\\" is always on a list of movies I give my students for recommended viewing.  This one, however, is a true misfire.  Who would have thought that an asymmetrical prostate would be the key to all of the lite-weight ideas about wealth, fame, privilege and the media and social distortion that attend those things.  But wait, maybe it's the description of how the Paul Giamatti character has constructed the solid waste disposal system in the porta-potty  that adorns his living room.  By the time I got to that point, my mind had already stopped flowing downhill. And a pet peeve; the bullet through the hand at the end might have had some shock value if I hadn't already seen it in the trailer.  Why would anybody consciously take impact out of a viewer's experience?  I'm forever hoping that this kind of thing is the decision of some flunky at the distribution company.  Peter Suschitzky's photography is good looking and Howard Shore's music is always cool.  Cronenberg's writing is almost always brilliant and coherent, but not this time.
B009VLX8FS|4.0|All other songs are much better than the poppy songs playing on the radio. Would be five stars if those songs didn't contaminate it a bit
B00AMBLXP8|3.0|Thought it would be funnier - glad I waited to &#34;rent&#34; rather than see this in the theater.  It's okay
B0015DYIH2|5.0|I have the book in hard back but wanted to be able to carry it with me so I could read it again as I got ready to see the final movie. This book served as a fitting conclusion to Stephenie Meyer's series.
B0081SPK0I|5.0|If you like the retro OutRun game by SEGA then your going to LOVE this game.<br /><br />Pros:<br />*Graphics are awesome<br />*Sound is great<br />*Game loads quickly<br />*Plays smoothly/fluently<br />*No intruding install requests<br /><br />Cons:<br />Car slows down sometimes during race on its own, have to lift finger off screen &amp; then press down again to pick up speed, might be my phone so still 5 stars.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|I played Blooms TD4 for hours on end and have been waiting for this ever since I saw it online<br /><br />Tower upgrading is much better with 2 different paths of upgrades and even special abilities. The agents you can buy will really help you on that Hard mode when you get slammed<br /><br />so many more things about this game I can't list em all. for the price it is definitely worth it.<br /><br />I only spent money on increasing monkey town range.<br /><br />if you're a fan of tower defense this is definitely the best!
B004MC8CA2|3.0|Can't use it at church without wifi.  Otherwise it would probably be good for  Bible study.  Can't read while traveling for the same reason.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this!!!  I ended up downloaded this on my kindle fire because tumblr stopped working and it definitely won over my heart.  I'm addicted!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was amazing.  The characters, storyline and the various twists and turns. Very emotional subject matter but so very well written. Every intricate detail. Loved it and love Colleen Hoover.  I was hooked from the beginning.  Great way to start my Christmas break.
B004SOR4H6|3.0|I downloaded this for my kindle fire and it works really well.  I'm not much of a twitterer but I'm sure someone who is active on twitter would appreciated this app.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Nicholas Sparks never disappoints! Once again he tells an amazing love story that is bound to make your heart melt!
B004SIIBGU|5.0|I downloaded this app on my kindle fire for days I could continue to bid on items when I'm away from my computer.  I love it and I'm glad I downloaded it!
B005LAIIQC|5.0|I loved the Matt Damon Bourne movies so was a bit skeptical of Renner and this character.  Renner nails it!  He does an excellent job of living up to the high marks earlier Bourne films have achieved.  His character is believable without being over the top.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This was an amazing book! I couldn't put it down...and still find myself thinking about it several days after I've finished it!
B0060D123K|4.0|I like the songs. My favorite part is when Bob and Tim come home together, singing. I regret to inform you that \\"When Love is Gone\\" is not included in the Instant Video cut. I know that there is a cover during the credits, but it's not the same. I had the VHS (with the song intact) as a kid, and I expected the same product.<br /><br />Michael Caine does a wonderful job. His reformed Scrooge gives me a very warm vibe, and I believe that those who have the pleasure of knowing him feel that and more.<br /><br />It bears stating that not every actor can work well with Muppets, as the folks over at Sesame Street will tell you.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I really like this app on my Kindle Fire. It's really easy to read. I also started to do a reading plan. I really enjoy it and I have a better understanding of the Bible now.
B009WO7NQO|4.0|My son loves this app and I think it was worth the purchase price. My one complaint is that it asks my son constantly if he wants to buy this upgrade or that upgrade and since he's playing on a kindle I don't like him being able to one click purchase add ons. If you pay for an app there shouldn't be advertising!
B008XG1X18|4.0|Pinterest is a little different to get use to as an app. I mostly just get on it when I'm online using my laptop. This is nice when I'm not near my computer.
B0029ZA3H4|4.0|I can't say I loved the book because I haven't finished it yet. So far, so good! Gary Vaunerchuk gives excellent input and a fresh perspective to the &#34;live your passion&#34; adage. He expresses himself in writing just as in the videos I've seen, energetic, fiery and to the point. He made me a believer again and got me thinking about my current lifestyle, and why I shouldn't settle for less.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|I enjoyed reading the 2nd book of the crossfire novels. A lot of this happened that I was expecting. I'm really excited for the 3 book to come out. I really don't want to wait until May to read it. :(
B009SQRL4U|5.0|Very good story and animation. I liked the contrast between the old time Santa and the new one. Good message about the true meaning of Christmas.
B00A9C3RB8|3.0|The movie is rated PG13 but we felt it was not appropriate for young teens. We were watching it with our teenagers and turned if off before we were half way through the movie. There was just to much adult material.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|This is a very fun story intertwining several older person's life's that randomly come together. It is filmed on location in Jaipur, India which allows for some cross-cultural learning and comedy. Good cast and location.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|The Amazing Spider-Man app is equipped with terrific 3D graphics, interesting campaign mode, and astounding moves to defeat enemies with (Thugs and villains). One of my favorite things to do is climb onto buildings, then jump off. Perfect game if you enjoy saving citizens, fighting crime, and having tons of fun while doing it.  I have no update requests, nor problems. It is a truly amazing app to play. I hope you enjoy this amazing app as well as I did!
B007UXSPK2|5.0|This movie you can watch over and over again, it is non-stop excitement. Everyone is great in it, especially Tom Cruise I can't wait for MI-5 to come out, but I can't imagine how they are going to top this one, but each one gets better and better. They is always a surprise at the end.
B0085YNML2|5.0|Chameleons spring back into action as they take on millions of challenges to munch on their favorite treat, bugs! I recommend Munch Time for all ages due to its puzzles and tons of color. Overall, Munch Time is a peaceful and colorful  game where you use your long tongue to stick onto flowers, then launch onto bugs and munch on them. Munch Time has amazing graphics expected from a game system. Thank you Gamistry for bringing a amazing puzzle app to android devices.
B00APUQH0W|4.0|It was a very enjoyable movie.  The actors had great chemistry with each other. It is a movie for the whole family. I hate to say it but I think Clint Eastwood should maybe retire he was good in it, but seems flail, even though his character could still do his job, I just don't know what kind of parts are left for him except grumpy old men. Amy Adams is always enjoyable, she is just plain good, and this was a different roll for her, and she pulled it off. Justin Timberlake was very likable, but he always seems to be. It is a good movie and you will not waste your money by renting it.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|FACEBOOK ON KINDLE IS WONDERFUL. MY DAUGHTER HAD TO ST IT UP FOR ME IM NOT TO GOOD WITH COMPUTER STUFF.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This sequel in the Crossfire series was a very enjoyable read...I feel the characters were well developed and the story line was interesting and fast paced.  If you enjoyed the 50 Shades of Grey series, you will also enjoy the Crossfire stories. At first I felt like the story was a rip-off of 50 Shades, but I am enjoying this series just as much. The characters are flawed but believable and the story is exciting. The sex scenes are raw, passionate and powerful. I only wish book 3 would be available sooner...
B00785P2QC|4.0|I think this game is really good, I enjoy playing it. if I was you I would down load it!!
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I have played at least five types of jewels. This one is by far the most satisfying and rewarding. A refreshing new take on this classic. The story and theme is cute too.
B004EBZX6W|1.0|I'm a new kindle user and finding this on my kindle is NOT intuitive. I can' t find it at all.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|The best Stephen King book in years.  Didn't have the doomsday or scary plots of many of his other books.  It was extremely well written and I couldn't put it down until I finished it!
B005MMJ84K|5.0|A MUST READ. One of the best sequels I have ever read. Can't wait for the next! Will be counting down the days!
031620157X|5.0|Witty and wonderful! Good for all ages, it sucks you in the plot and you get invested in the characters. It shines new light on the fairy-tale world in a refreshing way.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|While I could sit here and write a thousand page essay on why this novel is amazing, I still don't think I could do it justice. If you want to cry and laugh and be inspired and be given raw ideas that allow you to think beautiful thoughts and be given questions to answers you thought you understood, then read this story. If not, I suggest you go search Twilight by Stephanie Meyers and be on your merry way.
0316232955|5.0|I absolutely loved this book! I could connect to the characters and follow the plot effortlessly. I could not put this book down and have re-read the book many times. Already recommended to sevral people.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|You can relate to it. It's like reading about your life through another person's eyes.<br /><br />Not for children but high schoolers and above
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Wow....sort of speechless what an amazing story. It will make you cry and laugh and touched base on some serious and maybe uncomfortable issues. It was a twist that I didn't see coming. You fall in love with the characters. I read it in a day and a half. I had difficult time putting it down. You must read this book!!! I am looking forward to reading more from the author
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Just checking it out, but it seems ok. Haven't tried the full version yet but if it's like the demo, it should be pretty good.
B000YHE9J2|2.0|I liked the movie a lot. I saw it several years ago and it's one that I would see again.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I love this book it's great to read and I was standing on my toes the whole time I was reading it
B0013F1D02|5.0|This has all the required elements of a  great love story that can be enjoyed by both males and females.  The pirate scenes delight the guys and &#34;true love&#34; totally enchants the ladies.  Twists and turns keep you magically entertained.
B00992CF6W|5.0|weird sound dglitches I cant hear animalsnswiming nor sometimes I cant hear my block mining on my kindle please fix this.
0439023521|4.0|I dont usually read, but I was very glad about getting this book.  It is great.  it kept me interested.<br /><br />It was fun!
B007FEZQF8|5.0|Freaking awesome<br />I love the concept of this book  I love everything about it. It's just freaking awesome  thank you
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The Walking dead is a great show and amazon had it in awesome quality. I really enjoyed it to a point where I would definitely do it again.
B0041KVW2K|2.0|Just received my box set as a gift, and after reading about the issues with the pressing, I found 5 of the LPs with visible defects (Please Please Me, White Album, Abbey Road, Let It Be), which look like someone scratched them with a sharp object. For brand new LPs, and especially considering the die-hard audiophiles and Beatles fans who will sink a large amount of money into this, this is a complete insult. At the moment I'm away from my turntable so I can't yet say how these visual defects affect the sound, but from the looks of it at least some of the scratches look like they may cause the record spiral to be broken and create a loop. I plan to give these LPs a listen and contact Amazon about getting these replaced and update on what happens.<br /><br />Although the sleeves, box, and book all look spectacular, it really doesn't mean much if you can't enjoy the music itself because of the terrible vinyl pressings. In EMI's defense, it is difficult to find enough record pressing plants to press the 800,000 LPs needed for all the box sets in a climate of few record pressing plants, but if this was an issue then they should have delayed the release instead of wasting the money of audiophiles and Beatles fans on horrendously manufactured vinyl (since you know, the music itself is more important than the pretty packaging).<br /><br />And to nitpick a bit, I have no qualms with the 24 bit/192 kHz digital masters used for the majority of the LPs, but it's completely asinine to use the CD masters for Help and Rubber Soul just because George Martin did them for the 1980s CD versions. Although I prefer the sound of LPs sourced from analog, I understand why they would choose digital (at a higher than CD quality) because of the flexibility that it provides, but buying an LP that was made with a CD master completely defeats the purpose of the medium.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|It was good, but in the movie it had more parts to it. The book represented it a little. It wad still fantastic. They did a good job.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Down to the last  approximately 70 pages( wish there were page numbers) Read all of Grisham's books. Starts off great, bogs down in the middle, can't wait for the finish. Last section dynamite, recommend it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Going into this book I never quite imagined I would get sucked into it. The underlying romance and the trials they go through keep you hooked until the very last moment.
B001974DG0|5.0|There's no reason to write more than what is already written.  This is an awesome book and I've rarely read anything to make it's equal.  I had to cast my vote on this book
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I was absolutely just drowning in the beauty and simplicity of this book. It was perfect. I felt connected with Charlie and I felt wound up with his character and emotions and felt like a part of his family. I want to reread this book over and over because I'm absolutely on love with it.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|This is not a typical Stephen King book; i.e. not very suspenseful or scary but it is an excellent read and some part are intriguing. It's a time-travel sci=fi.<br /> It's only the last quarter of the book that becomes hard to put down.  King develops the characters, even side characters, so well that it's almost like you know them and become to like and really admire them.<br /><br />It's really a great read and I highly recommend it.<br /><br />I only gave it 4 stars for the lack of King \\"suspense\\"
B007VUCAVO|4.0|This is a very nicely done app, graphically as well as functionally. The only thing I,d like to see is an on-screen visual of the batteries percent of charge so that you don,t have to open the app to view this information.
B000VHMF0A|5.0|I remember listening to this album in college on those lazy days. It's great that Amazon made this available for such a great price; hopefully many new fans purchased it. Long live Bob Marley!
B0076DELIG|5.0|I was starting to tire of this series a bit when this book came out. Michael Connelly did a great job of coming up with a great story line and a very interesting book.  There is even a hint of what the future of this series might be.
B005DOKM9M|4.0|Purchased for a friend, as long as you don't mind unzipping to get access it looks like it will give very good protection.
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|I purchased this for a gift.  I picked it from a wish list.  It came in good condition and matched the description.  The person I gave it to seemed pleased.
B004ZZS4CC|4.0|A quick read for a more adult reader. Some parts are difficult to get through due to the detailing.- Jaycees courage and strength are obvious.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|The DVD arrived in good shape, matched the description.  I purchased it for a gift, from a wish list.  Pleased to give it.
B0063IH60K|3.0|But having to sit through some ads that have no skip option after a few seconds is tiresome.  I enjoy the game play enough to continue playing this app, but I see room for improvement.
B005FVNIW6|5.0|Have just read this book for the nth time. Totally gripping. OK, the age of the heros is a bit of a challenge, but the story is just outstanding. Love the sequels too, but this sets the scene and is the best read. Just makes you wish for more...
B005KB0SU6|5.0|`El juego del ángel' es una novela que nos transporta a Barcelona en comienzos del siglo XX en una trama  llena de misterios e intrigas que hacen de cada página una muy interesante. Lo recomiendo. También otros buenos libros de toda clase de temas y de diferentes autores tales como: El legado de un titán, `Una cierta justicia, [[ASIN:B006H9QUGG Resurgir de la esvástica, El (Ebook) [Versión Kindle]]], y El salón de Ámbar'.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|The story was absorning and I learned enough about cyber-terrorism to make me really uncomfortanble.  But that's not unusual in Clancy's books. They hit home. I definitely recommend this book.
B004SIPA4G|4.0|amaing box cover art , same as 300, love the quality and content, must have box set for all of frank's fans ,
B000HKW7E0|2.0|A very mediocre movie, selected based on high customer review but was disappointed.<br />Bad jokes and scenes when you are watching with family and kids, negativity amongst family, silly things.<br />Pros: Family stands behind him<br /><br />Would certainly repeat watching movies I liked rather than watch this one.<br /><br />If you just want to kill time, maybe watch it. Nothing you are missing out on.
B007STBUIW|4.0|all time favourite classic , remastered in pure clean sharp digital format for the HD tv, just too sweet to describe the quality, watch jaws like never before!!!
0316232955|1.0|I didn't read this book before giving it to my thirteen year old great granddaughter. But when she showed me the first page with one swear word after another I was shocked.  The reviews should have mentioned that this book is for older teenagers if for anyone. It will be returned,
B00735HGQ6|5.0|Loved the book and was caught up in Harold's quest for redemption and the underlying cause of his journey. The reason was teasingly revealed and I found myself cheering for the Fry family and shedding tears of remorse over the cause
B003O86FMW|4.0|Great first book, great second book, now on to the third! .. Love this series so far! Can't wait to finish the series!
B000KFB4PK|5.0|I gave this to my grandson in his stocking.  It took him VERY LITTLE time to put it together and he was so pleased that the watch actually worked
B009VLX8FS|5.0|This is a great album from Taylor Swift. Even better it was on a special sale for $1.99. The sound is great.
B004JZBGWI|4.0|Great way to take notes in various colors for sorting by theme or importance - AND - on my phone, kindle or desk/laptop!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I'm not much of a zombie flick type but I love this and am totally reeled in. Enjoy! It really gets you from the start. Watch seasons 1 and 2 first though
B005LHOKFS|5.0|Love this program - I am a contributor with TripAdvisor and its nice knowing I can give my Two Cents on my Kindle Fire or Galaxy Phone as well as my computer back home.
B0098VYKSA|5.0|Hubby and I watched this on our Couch Date night and I was really impressed and it was good.  Would watch it again.
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|Our entire family enjoyed this movie (ages 14 to 8).  Definitely on par with &#34;Tangled&#34;, just not the typical happily-ever after Princess love-story fairytale.  And the music is great, too!
B00006LSM3|5.0|I knew this would be a poignant album as Harrison was working on it before he died. Too bad this album didn't get as much airplay as it did.<br /><br />Macwoodusa.
B009NQKXYK|3.0|This was a good movie for a night that had nothing else to  do in it.  It is one of the movies that I enjoyed while I watched it, but it was not one that really made an impact.  Good for momentary pleasure if you like Sci-Fi.
B0026NWBY2|5.0|Enough said. I like everything about this cd including the submission of some of the &#34;live&#34; cuts that are included in this compilation.<br /><br />Macwoodusa.
B00A4TKDKY|5.0|You will want it. No matter how many other versions of the songs you have.  I leave the \\"Technical\\" Mixing quality comments to others who feel they must contribute their opinion, and just review it from the perspective of a hardcore blues and Buddy Guy Lover.  If you have never been to a Blues Club for live music, be warned.  You may hear swearing, innuendo, and general ribaldry.  If that shocks you, try a different genre or desensitize.  The first seven songs, leave you longing for visuals as well as the audio, especially if you have seen him live.  The clearly noted \\"BONUS Studio Recordings\\" are welcome filler.  Bottom line - is it worth the value?  Yes.  Maybe even a hell yes. Buddy, no matter what age, is a blues ambassador, highly skilled musician, and solid entertainer.  Within that context, I can't imagine any solid blues fan or critic finding fault with what this CD really is.
B0001HAHXW|5.0|I'm a big fan of EC and RJ but I wish this would have been more of an acoustic album and some of the song choices were ones that could have been better.<br /><br />Macwoodusa.
B002VPE1WK|4.0|Got the backpack for free with the purchase of a Canon T4i. Was very surprised at the quality and layout. The pack is well padded all around and provides very good protection for the gear in side. The interior is adjustable to different size and shapes to accomodate each item such as flash, lens, and the camera itself.
B0053O89WY|5.0|Watched the entire season in 1 day. Awesomely funny..a note though, don't attempt to eat or drink while watching, you may choke because you'll want to laugh so often
1440778183|4.0|My kids really enjoy listening to the &#34;Wimpy Kid&#34; series in the car.  The reading is great-and they work around the cartoons in the printed books by giving a brief description of the situation in the reading.  I had to drive a car full of 3rd graders for a field trip, and this was just the thing to keep things more calm and quiet for the trip!
B001GMH8RO|4.0|Its a great movie. Was received within a week of ordering it. Haven't watched the blu-ray version of this movie yet, but I'm sure it's fine.
B0091REZMW|4.0|This game is amazing. I'm totally addicted. There's as always something new. Everyone in my family plays this game. We love it.
B003L77G6A|5.0|As I rated the 5th season, it is awesome! Seriously funny and I would recommend not drinking or eating while watching the episodes for fear of choking while laghing
B005HSL626|5.0|This is a really good game and  you don't even have to think I. It if you don't want to
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|Works great, easy clip on design and comfortable fabric. I bought this to just feel safer about putting my kindle in my carry-on and it just the job as expected.
B00A0SKFLG|5.0|For those who are not die hard arnold fans this movie was really good! I liked it way better than the original!
B0071DJZZA|4.0|I didn't think it would be this good. I'm looking forward to the next books.  Then I will watch the movies.
B009P0VLGI|5.0|thanks for this cds, I order 3 (one for me and 2 for others guys) and i from Venezuela, in this country are lot  fans julia and lena...
