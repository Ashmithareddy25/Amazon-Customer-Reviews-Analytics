B008Y1YK0I|5.0|Lawrence Of Arabia is a film that should be in every serious movie lover's library. There are perhaps five movies in history where it all comes together: story,direction,acting,cinematography and music. These are 1.Gone With The Wind (2)The Empire Strikes Back (3)Citizen Kane (4)Ben Hur and this one. This is the story of T.H. Lawrence, a British soldier in WWI who helped organize the Arab nation. I have been waiting for this release ever since Blu-ray was introduced and it doesn't disappoint. The quality of picture and sound is excellent. A definite no brainer purchase for this reviewer.

B009VSW15Y|2.0|I like the idea of a camera on the kindle fire but don't like the fact that you have to have your back to whatever you want to take pic of and angle tablet accordingly.  If It's a camera it should work like a regular camera.

B005P4PAVK|5.0|This show is hysterical. Highly recommend it to all. If you've started from the beginning, you already know how funny the show is. If you haven't watched from the beginning. I recommend starting with Season 1, but it would still be funny starting with 5.
B00A1U2SVS|4.0|Great to hear from this band after all these years-Jimmy Page can still play.  Robert Plant can still deliver and Jason Botham on drums.  (this is his I belive his third time playing with the band- his first was at age 10-his father wanted to see what Led Zep looked like.) Great Album recommend to all Led Zep fans.

B00973DDN2|3.0|Album sounds big and bombastic, but, as other reviewers have pointed out, the songs are dull, hookless, missing something. Guitar is buried too deep in the mix on most of the songs. How do they play these songs live? By hiding 5 keyboard players behind all the palm trees?

0451196716|4.0|About a month ago, I picked up my three-fourths unfinished copy of Stephen King's The Bachman Books. I say three-fourths because I had only read the first of four short novels contained in the book, the now out-of-print Rage, several years ago now. Rage is a dark and un-fantastic story that I didn't care for much, and the fact that it is now out of print is a good thing (King has admitted this himself). Despite this rare miss for King, other avid fans consider these four novels to be among his best work. Regarding the other three books in the collection, I would say my opinion falls somewhere in the middle of the road; these are not his very best works, but they are also far from his worst.<br />I'm going to skip over Rage altogether for the aforementioned reason; it simply isn't that good and there isn't a whole lot to say about it. The true King fan ought to read it for sake of inclusion, and there is some classic-King dialogue in it that warrants a nod, but plot-wise it is territory that most folks wouldn't enjoy dwelling upon.<br />The Long Walk, deals with a futuristic game-show of sorts in which all the contestants but the winner end up dead (it shares similarities with the last story in the Bachman collection, The Running Man). This story jumps right in with little backstory; a teen boy has been selected for this deadly annual competition called The Long Walk and his mother is driving him to the starting point. It involves exactly one hundred contestants, all male, all in their teens or young twenties, and the objective is to walk without stopping for as far as you can until you fall over dead. Slow down, stop, or violate the rules in any other way: you get a warning. Three warnings in a row, and you 'buy a ticket,' which means to be shot by one of the supervising soldiers on the sidelines. The prize: lifelong fame and riches for your entire family (starting to sound a little like The Hunger Games, is it not?). The participants volunteer for the game, which is televised, and it is somewhat of an honor to be accepted. The game is sponsored by a shadowy government and headed up by an equally mysterious official called 'The Colonel.'<br />Initially, I was very intrigued by the idea but quickly began to wonder how King could possibly turn this idea into a 200-something page novel; it sounded more like a short story to me. But he does an excellent job of keeping things interesting, both with the initial shock of boys being killed early on in the competition and with lengthy, yet engaging, dialogue between the boys regarding their pasts, their connections to the Long Walk, their plans for spending if they win, and other entertaining (and often crude) teenage-boy banter.<br />As the story unfolds, you find yourself rooting more and more for a handful of the competing boys (or aching for some of the troublesome ones to fall out) and all the while knowing that all but one of them will surely die. There is a claustrophobic, choking element to the story as you move along the road with them, realizing more personally what a sickening experience this would be, with literally no way out once you've begun but to win, or be shot. King uses a wide array of adjectives to convey just how tired these young men are becoming as they walk through one, then two, then three entire days and nights with not a single stop to rest, and maintaining the required speed of at least four miles per hour. Their feet aching is only the beginning; there's going to the bathroom to consider, charley horses in the legs to avoid, cramps from drinking too much water, salvaging the food they carry on their person, not falling asleep as they walk through the dark, and all the while not just giving up hope and sitting down on the pavement in defeat. There were parts of this book that just made me physically weary, perhaps like reading a Jack London novel can make one imagine they feel very cold.<br />The ending leaves a little bit to be desired as it stops abruptlyand partially open-ended. Just the same, it is perhaps the right ending, as the winning character finds himself in a bit of a catch-22 in the presence of his oppressive government, and it allows the reader to formulate in his own imagination what might have happened.<br />Overall, it is a vivid and uncomfortable novel in the most compelling of ways, and is ultimately worth the journey.and partially open-ended.

0451197968|4.0|The Running Man is perhaps the best story in Stephen King's Bachman collection. It is fast-paced and original, and curiously enough King states in the introduction that he wrote it start to finish in a 72-hour mad-dash flurry of typing and made very few changes to the final draft.<br /><br />Similarly to The Long Walk, it is about a deadly game show, and takes place in a version of the future where all television is regulated by the government, and all that is on are deadly game shows, as humans have come to a point where other people suffering is the only thing they find entertaining. Most of the world lives in extreme poverty, amongst trash- and drug-laden streets where prostitution is a common and necessary occupation for young mothers. Everyone is forced to own a television and everyone is forced to keep it on all the time, never free from the presence of the fatal game shows. People volunteer to appear on the shows often because they have no other choice to make money.<br /><br />One such volunteer is Ben Richards, a young man too poor to buy medicine for his terminally ill daughter. He begrudgingly goes through the rigorous physical and mental screening for the shows, ends up scoring quite high, and is accepted onto the ultimate game, The Running Man, where the risk is the highest but the winnings the greatest. The survival rate on Running Man is zero. The singular contestant is given a twelve-hour headstart to flee as far and fast as he can, using whatever methods necessary, to avoid the ominous Hunters; men who are sent out by the show's producers with the sole purpose of tracking down the contestant and killing him.<br /><br />More is unraveled about the corrupt, Big-Brother-esque government and the condition of the futuristic country that has become a wasteland as the book goes on. Civilians are offered a $100.00 prize for providing accurate information about the contestant's location; $1000.00 if the info leads to a kill. In a way, the entire country is against Ben Richards as he runs, and the masses watch in lusty anticipation of his violent, on-screen death.<br /><br />This story is just wild, and has some pretty cool twists and turns as Richards writhes his way across the country in evasion of the Hunters, a few times escaping some seemingly impossible positions. It is quick and fun and packs a bang, displaying the best of King's ability to keep things thrilling and fresh. The chapters are even marked in reverse order from 100 down to 0 as the clock ticks down for Ben Richards. There are multiple ideas presented in the story that are both original and familiar, perhaps giving a nod to futuristic-utopia novels like 1984 or Brave New World. It ended up being my favorite of the Bachman Books, for it is exciting, unique, and feels very different from any other King work I have read thus far. Plus, the climax is fantastic.<br /><br />There's a movie adaptation loosely based upon King's book with (of all people) Arnold Schwarzenegger, and I cannot yet attest to the quality of that film (and my expectations are sadly low, considering the time-period in which it was made), but the book is definitely worth a read, not only for King fans, but also for frequenters of sci-fi or thrillers, as The Running Man is a pleasant twist of both.gainst Ben Richards as he runs, and the masses watch in lusty anticipation of his violent, on-screen death.<br /><br />This story is just wild, and has some pretty cool twists and turns as Richards writhes his way across the country in evasion of the Hunters, a few times escaping some seemingly impossible positions.

1601254679|5.0|As a modern busy Game Master on the go, it is always handy to have an army of adversaries at your disposal to throw at your pesky players.<br /><br />In the NPC codex we have all 11 core classes represented by 20 characters of level 1-20.

Most of the NPCs have great pictures and short descriptors of the characters goals, history, and social demeanors.<br /><br />This book has representatives for all the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook characters. I eagerly anticipate the Ultimate Magic and Ultimate Combat expansions of the NPC Codex.
0451197879|3.0|Roadwork is perhaps the oddest in the Bachman collection, as it is somewhat inconsistent in that it begins one way and ends in quite another. I may very well have just interpreted it wrongly, or it may just be an example of the 'mistakes' of a young writer.<br /><br />It has to do with a man, Bart, who has just received notice that the building of a freeway overpass is going to push him out of his home and his job, and to say the least: he isn't happy about it. The opening pages find him buying a high-powered rifle and conversing silently with two zany personalities, Fred and George, inside his head. Bart is offered a reasonable sum for his home, and is also given opportunity to relocate the laundromat at which he has worked for many years and in which he has secured a semi-high position. Instead, in a fury of anger at the injustice being done against him and his wife, he takes matters into his own hands and sets out to sabotage the freeway construction.<br /><br />While the book begins with an intriguing level of, well, craziness coming from the main character (you get the feeling that Bart has more than a few screws loose), as it carries on things get somewhat more tame and unexciting. Bart's obsession with revenge against the roadwork company ultimately ends his marriage. He has an affair with a teen hitchhiker, but the inclusion of this section feels like page-filler as it is completely unnecessary. His pursuits of vengeance take him to a mafia member's office in search of explosives and to a construction site with a car-full of molotov cocktails, all leading up to a showdown with the police while holed up in his house and armed to the teeth, refusing to allow the bulldozers to level the home. But all of these events come and go with little significance, and the action is too few and far between in a book with such a premise as this. It is primarily plot-driven with little else to cling to.<br /><br />What bothered me most of all was that the two crazy personalities in Bart's head, Fred and George, are all but forgotten by the end. King makes frequent reference to them in the beginning, but by the end (when one would think a crazy person was only getting crazier and talking to himself more) they are scarcely mentioned. It's like they are an element that was included for a purpose that the author forgot to carry through.<br /><br />It was harder to stick with this one simply because it wasn't all that exciting. It has it's moments of excitement or humor as most of King's works do, but it tends to dwell in places that are honestly a bit boring and has an overall lack of direction. The climax is decent but expected, and can be seen coming from many pages away. I don't mean to sound overly harsh on Roadwork, and I certainly feel that all of King's books warrant a look for one reason or another. This one is not all bad; it just isn't great. Others may find more between the pages than I did.ties in Bart's head, Fred and George, are all but forgotten by the end.

B004YM6JLO|2.0|I LOVE THE VAMPIRE DIARIES. . . Don't get me wrong. The dvds were just badly packaged inside the case. When I received the item discs 4 and 5 were loose. I was hoping it would not be scratched so badly that I couldn't view them, but it was. I was highly disappointed about how these discs fit into the case. The seller did however give me a refund and was very cooperative. I went and bought the season from Wal-mart and it was packaged differently than the one from here and was more sensible in how it was packaged.

B005PK5C12|5.0|I wanted to see how this turned out so I watched the entire first series even though it was warped and disturbing.  I couldn't help but keep watching.  The story line keeps your attention to the very end with an amazing ending...very fitting and I guess one could say, comes full circle.  One of those shows where you really enjoyed it but would never want to watch again.  Definitely disturbing.  I won't be watching the 2nd series.  I guess horror in series form is too much for me!  Admire those who have gone on to watching the 2nd season!

The walking dead is great, its a cool show for zombie lovers but its also got the drama ad storyline needed for everyone else.  The zombies although scary looking do not pop out and scare you so I got my mom and dad addicted to this show!  I wish we could purchase them on sunday night after they have been aired, but so far the earliest purchase date for this show seems to be the following day.  So every monday we all get together little sister (14) my brother (24) and my mom and dad (mid 50's) all come over to my house to watch this show and hang out.  I recommend this and breaking bad, both really great shows and fun to bring the family together, shocks my mom and dad but i know they love it and its great for young adults to.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|The only reason I gave this book 1 star is because you have to give it at least one star to write a review.  This book is horrible.  The author is a new author so I was really excited to read this book. It shocks me that an editor read this book and released it.  With fifty shades of grey I was expecting my face to turn at least one shade of red.  Unfortunatly I found myself completely let down.  The story line was fun but when the characters do the same thing over and over again I felt like I was having deja vu.  \\"We got in the helecopter and he strapped me in with such force. bla bla bla.\\" Then the next chapter is filled with the same thing \\"We got into the helecopter and he tightened my helecopter seatbelt and I felt moisture and excitement when he talked down to me and flies me home to leave me alone and expect me to follow your rules.\\"  I love the bravery to explore this sexual concept of control and acting things out, but I recommend doing some research on how to make these basic sex scemerios sound more exciting. I do not know if the author imporved on the next two books of this series but I asked my friend who read them and she told me not to waste my time or money.  She said that it was helicopter ride after helicopter ride and the same conversation over and over again.  I want storyline and drama but there is only so many times you can copy and paste the same conversation into the book before your readers begin to notice. I have read some boring books but this one takes the cake, I literally skipped page after page of helicopter rides. I RECOMMEND READING SOMETHING ELSE.<br /><br />one more thing.  It is one thing to write an adult book, but this should not be for sale to minors.  I would not want any teenagers or children being able to even view this book on kindle or in barnes n noble.  If you stop reading after the first book you are left with an impression that woman are pretty much stupid.  It sends the message that even if you are a decent person whosaved yourself to your 20's and are a nice young woman, if you want to ride in helicopters and have nice things like that you have to be some mans slave idiot piece of trash.  Kinky sex is one thing but he was demeaning to her in her personal life as well, controling and disgusting.  I would never let any woman I know read this garbage, and any man wouldnt last 5 minutes with this amature book.

B007GCY8FS|1.0|\\"A Wanted Man\\" is just terrible.  Obviously, Lee Child no longer cares about Jack Reacher, writing a quality novel, or his readers.  I guess he has a contract to fulfill and merely turns out the required number of words.  Not only is this story preposterous (The explanation at the end for what the \\"terrorists\\" were doing is completely rediculous.) but the writing is tedious, redundant, and downright amatuerist. Lot's of it is almost like baby talk.  The story facts are also all messed up.  Just try to figure out what the weather is like in the middle of winter in Nebraska and Kansas, or how Reacher can be driving a car in the middle of the night and see the \\"hostage\\" in the back seat sending him signal by blinking her eyes. I think that Childs and Random House figure there are a certain number of people who will buy every Reacher novel just to keep their collection complete, so quality doesn't matter.  All the other reviewers who gave this one star are dead on. I can't begin to imagine what the five-star reviewers think is a well-written story. By the way, will Reacher ever get to Virginia?  We can only hope so.  Maybe then he'll find his girl, settle down, and we won't have to read trash like this.  Save yout money.
B0027MJU00|4.0|She looks like a nice person, and I have no reason to believe that she isn't. But she writes about some of the most twisted, miserable, good-for-nothing human beings imaginable.<br /><br />Dark Places, the second of Gillian Flynn's three novels to date and the second I've read (after her spectacular current best-seller, Gone Girl), takes a novel approach to unraveling the truth behind a 1985 mass murder in the American Heartland known as the Satanic Ritual Murders of Kinakee. Kinakee is a small, depressed farm town in Kansas, but we learn little about the town. The murders took place in the middle of the night on the small, failing farm of the Day family, where Patty Day and her four children -- 15-year-old Ben, 10-year-old Michelle, and Debby and Libby, who are eight and seven respectively -- have been living on the edge of starvation. Their father, Runner, has long since fled the farm, having driven it to the point of foreclosure with a series of extravagant and unnecessary equipment purchases.<br /><br />Now, 24 years later, Ben is nearing 40, serving a life sentence for the murders of his mother and sisters. Libby, now 31, who survived the murders by hiding outside in the cold, has been living from the donations sent to support her and from the meager income from her book about the murders, but now the money is nearly gone. The story unfolds in chapters that alternate between Ben's recollections of that day in January 1985, mixed with his mother's alternate accounts, and Libby's discoveries as the prospect of easy money that will help her avoid getting a job draws her more and more deeply into investigating the events of that day.<br /><br />Flynn writes with a sure hand, and she does an outstanding job of building suspense in what seems an effortless manner. I found myself increasingly tense as the book neared its conclusion -- suspecting I knew what had happened but doubting myself because it seemed so unlikely. Unfortunately, I was right, and that contrived ending is the book's biggest flaw. But it's a roller-coaster ride all the way to the end and well worthwhile for the thrill.nding is the book's biggest flaw.

B0030IIZ4M|5.0|A film to last the ages, Toy Story is definitely a tale that any child, teen, adult, or anything in-between and afterward will always hold close to their heart and watch time-and-time again. Every child likes to think their toys are alive, and this series brings that imagination and joy to life. I'd recommend this film to anyone, and if you're looking for a simply DVD versus the expenses of Blu-ray (for little-to-no extra benefit) this is the way to go!

A terrific storyteller, Sir Ken is one of the top visionary, paradigm-shifting thought-leaders out there today. The book's absolutely awful cover design (which, for the longest time, actually kept me from picking it up to read it) gives no hint as to the wonders inside. I highly recommend reading it from cover-to-cover.

And then I'd recommend going back to buy the first, and then the second. Excellent animation and beautiful colors, fantastic storyline. Buy and enjoy!

B004DLPXAO|5.0|I have used many ebook readers in the past, I don't have a kindle and for a while I hesitated to use the app, but I installed in my PC and I found it very good, then when I bought my tablet, the very first app that I installed on it was kindle for android, I have use it in my tablet for two years already, and definitely I strongly recommend it. I am a Microsoft Certified Trainer with more than 30 years experience in computers and recommend this app.

B005NNV044|5.0|Meddle is among the best of Pink Floyd's albums.  This remastered MP3 download was a welcome addition to my music library.<br /><br />I have owned the tape, vinyl, and CD versions in the past and wore them out.
B008G8SFGO|4.0|I have been a KISS fan since I was in second grade, and got Double Platinum and Love Gun for my birthday.  I was hooked.  I have over the years been excited and disappointed by the bands efforts.  I was really excited when Sonic Boom hit.  It was like putting the needle on a new record back in the day.  Than when I heard they were working on another new album I was ecstatic.  I was a little less so when I heard the single this summer.  Hell or Hallelujah was just so so for me.  It didn't spark any interest in the album.  But when I saw it in stores and finally picked it up anyway.....Well I was just blown away.  All the songs kick ass, and Gene's playing is ferocious.  I'd have to agree with another reviewer and say my favorite song is All for the Love of Rock and Roll.  It definitely gives a nod to an earlier era of music, but it does so while keeping you grounded in the here and now.<br /><br />I very highly recomend this to any Kiss fan, or even would be Kiss fan....and if you are not interested in Kiss, give this a listen anyway.  You might just find yourself rocking out with it without even realizing it....

B005LAIHY0|1.0|I had such high hopes for this one, especially being directed by Ridley Scott.  Disjointed and lumbering plot made me keep thinking, \\"when is the plot actually going to start\\"?!  This is nothing but an attempt at a scare fest movie set in space.

1612191290|1.0|I was assigned this book for an upper-level Econ class based around responses from different angles towards Smith's Wealth of Nations and capitalism.  I am conservative in terms of economics but have had my views challenged and even altered by previously assigned books this semester, which range from Marx, Polyani, and Veblen to modern works by Hacker and Pierson.  I believe that I have taken these all with an open mind, and was expecting some interesting information presented here by Graeber.  Instead, I often found myself having to go back and reread entire sections in order to even figure out which direction he was going, and even then I rarely could understand what the argument he was trying to make was.  The general thesis was that debt was necessary to some extent (agreed), and while he could have made this argument strictly from an economic basis, he instead extends it to impossible lengths by straying into the moral area.  He argues that some debts should not be enforced because of the conditions on which they are loaned but does not offer any real way to measure where the line should be drawn on this moral issue.  Who is to say which debts are to be paid and which aren't?  Graeber also makes the point that not all debts have to be paid back by pointing to the Bank of England, which was started by a loan from the bankers to the King, which can't be paid back without destroying the base on which the bank is built.  This is true, but was clearly a calculated move and was never supposed to be paid back.<br /><br />Graeber also didn't do a great job of backing up his opinions with any proof, instead using broad statements such as \\"generally recognized\\" fairly liberally throughout the book.  I was disappointed by this book.  I had hoped for some insights into the recent economic downturn and instead found another piece of pop econ that is lacking in research and objectivity.

B008NN8IVY|5.0|While my main Lego city purchases are the Modular Buildings, I do pick up pieces every now and then to complement them and this parking garage certainly caught my attention. It is quite large, comes loaded with neat play features, and includes 4 civilian vehicles (it is difficult to find good Lego vehicles that are not emergency service vehicles). I imagine that most kids would go crazy over this set and adult Lego fans would love to add the various pieces to their Lego towns.<br /><br />The Facts:<br /># of pieces: 933<br />Lego suggested price: $99.99<br />Minifigures: 1 mechanic, 1 security guard, 1 female driver, 2 male drivers.<br /><br />The positives:<br />*This set is quite large! It scales nicely with larger Lego structures like many of the modular buildings. Lots of room to park multiple vehicles.<br /><br />*I love the fact that the set includes 4 vehicles- 2 cars, a VW van, and a tow truck. Each vehicle comes with a driver as well.<br /><br />*The features on the set all work really well! The elevator works perfectly, taking vehicles to the proper level of the garage. The car wash, entrance barrier, fuel pumps, and mechanic's shop all are very nicely detailed and are fun to play with or set up displays around.<br /><br />*The signs on the sides of the building are quite neat and really add to the vibe of this being a multi-purpose facility.<br /><br />The negatives:<br />*Lots of stickers. I really wish Lego gave us more printed tiles, but alas this set is packed with stickers. They're easy to put on, but just not the same as a nice printed tile.<br /><br />Overall: This is probably one of the most fun Lego sets available currently. You get a huge building, lots of tools, gas pumps, 5 minifigures, and 4 vehicles. I really felt like I got my money's worth as this set has lots of potential for fun. It isn't too difficul to assemble this set, although younger builders might need some help with applying the stickers and assembling the strings for the elevator cable and tow truck winch.r cable and tow truck winch.
B005LAII62|4.0|Norman sees and talks to dead people. He is tasked to stop the curse of the town's witch trail from centuries ago. In his school, kids who talk to dead people get bullied. The characters are stereotypical.<br /><br />The beginning of the movie has a spoof of \\"B\\" zombie films that was very clever, down to the boom mike making it into the picture. I enjoyed this movie more than the famous Tim Burton productions. While there is nothing wrong in this film per se, there are some things parents might want to know. In one sentence, belief in life after death is equated to belief in astrology. Also the hot guy liked by teen Courtney mentions his boyfriend, shades of \\"Call Me Maybe.\\"<br /><br />The people who killed the young witch were wrong, they were considered simply afraid. There are no religious elements associated with the witch trial.<br /><br />If I was gong to improve this film, I would of had Betty White play grandma and written her character appropriately. Comedian Jeff Garlin as the dad did a great voice.

B000SW4DXK|5.0|This is a story of HOPE and BELIEVING in something bigger than yourself- and what better time of year to feel that, than at Christmas time! As a little girl, I loved the original version, but as I had children of my own and they were introduced to this newer, updated one, I came to love it as well!
B006UG90RM|3.0|Not that the world needs another fan review of Van Halen's new record, but I just gotta. So hear it is, a completely biased and subjective break down of \\"A Different Kind of Truth\\" from a Van Halen apologist's point of view.<br /><br />I'll start with Wolfie, because his participation in the band has ticked off a lot of people.  Wolfie is not Mikey and I'm glad. Mikey is missed, but I like Wolfie . The dude can play and I think he brings a fresh new outlook to the band.  I just hope he doesn't get ruined by the business.  In a sort of neener-neener moment, I want to say that I supported Wolfie from the beginning. I was bummed that Mike was gone, but the idea of three Van Halens playing Van Halen music really piqued my interest. I'm glad to say that Wolfie doesn't disappoint.<br /><br />We'll go with Dave next. Man, is it good to have him back. He just has a certain style that makes Eddie play a certain way. As far as partnerships go, Eddie and Dave are up there with Lennon/McCartney or Richards/Jagger. His lyrics have become more metaphysical and, dare I say, introspective. Still, his wit is intact and he doesn't shy away from the sublime or the ridiculous. No one can ride the line between clever and stupid like Dave, and the album works largely because Dave is back.<br /><br />Alex Van Halen has always been one of my favorite drummers and it is good to hear some new stuff from him. He turns in another excellent performance on this album. His drum tone is instantly recognizable and his rhythm and timing leads to some of the most unique riffing patterns any drummer has ever played.  I will spend many nights wearing headphones so I can specifically focus on Alex. I can't say enough about the guy.<br /><br />Eddie Van Halen has been my favorite guitar player since I first heard him nearly 30 years ago. I know there are players out there that have technical skills that surpass Eddie, but no one plays like Eddie when he's on fire - and he's on fire throughout the album.He sounds like he has been trying to figure out new ways to play again and that is refreshing. It's a horrible thing when an artist and craftsman like Eddie feels like they are just going through the motions.  Eddie is obviously having fun and it is good to hear him wail again.<br /><br />Overall the album rocks. Even the weakest songs aren't that bad. The band has taken a lot of flak for redoing old demos, but after listening to the album a several dozen times, I think those old demos helped the band get in touch with their roots. Some of the old stuff does sound a little dated, but it works for the most part.<br /><br />\\"Tattoo\\" - I like this song a lot better now that I know it isn't the best song on the album. The intro guitar line is reminiscent of \\"Jamie's Cryin'.\\" I guess it used to be called \\"Down in Flames,\\" which I You Tubed for comparison. I heard a couple of different bootlegs but the old version didn't impress me either. I think \\"Tattoo\\" works just as well as it is.  One of my favorite solos from Eddie. Not a bad tune.<br /><br />\\"She's the Woman\\" - Now, I did have a pretty good bootleg of this from the original demo. It was a cool song then and is a cool song now, even with different lyrics. It delivers that hard funk Van Halen is known for. The new bridge is cool and the arpeggio solo section takes the song on a quick ride before returning to the main groove. Cool song all around.<br /><br />\\"You and Your Blues\\" - The first brand new track on the album. It has a sort of tricked out \\"Ain't Talkin' 'Bout Love\\" sort of intro riff but then evolves into a solid mid-tempo rocker. This one's a sleeper and may take a while to get used to, though there is plenty of good playing on it. Cool tune.<br /><br />\\"China Town\\" - Another new one. Is a double-time rocker and one of the heaviest tunes on the album. The verse has a cool breakneck groove, and the chorus wails. Great solo by Eddie and Wolfie. A favorite.<br /><br />\\"Blood and Fire\\" - This is a very cool tune. Parts of it came from a movie in the 80s called \\"The Wild Life,\\" but it sounds like a brand new song on \\"Truth.\\" Eddie has a great solo wrapped up with some great riffs by Alex. Another favorite.<br /><br />\\"Bullethead\\"  - This is another oldie. I like its punk rock vibe. It's kind of obnoxious but has some good playing in it. Another sleeper.<br /><br />\\"As Is\\" - This is another crazy brand new Van Halen song. Alex kicks it off with one of his signature drum riffs as the guitar and bass lay down a heavy groove. Then the band kicks into high-octane boogie mode while Dave quick-talks through his trademark philosophical jive that makes perfect sense, yet no sense at all.  The outro fades under feedback and speed metal riffs. Freaking awesome.<br /><br />\\"Honeybabysweetiedoll\\" - A surprisingly heavy tune considering its title. This is no pop tune. Instead the band throws down some of the heaviest riffage of the album on this song. It is supposedly taken from an old song called \\"Act Like it Hurts,\\" but there's barely a resemblance. If Dave were spitting some bit about death and destruction in a cookie monster voice, this would easily be a circle pit classic. Cool tune, but probably not for the casual fan.<br /><br />\\"The Trouble With Never\\" - This is the first song from the album that I caught myself singing unconsciously. I didn't immediately like this song at all, but for some reason it's the one my brain latched on to and out of nowhere I would start singing the chorus. It has since become one of my favorites.  It's got a funky little breakdown that has Dave dropping verse like a beat poet over a wash of Eddie's guitar feedback. Cool tune<br /><br />\\"Outta Space\\" - This used to be called \\"Let's Get Rockin',\\" and from what I can tell it was a pretty rocking tune back then. The 2012 version is quite the rocker too, with the main musical parts staying pretty much intact. Dave's lyrics show a more evolved sense of songwriting. Good to hear the song as an official release.  Another good tune.<br /><br />\\"Stay Frosty\\" - Dave, in full used-car-salesman-turned-sidewalk-prophet mode, leads the band through a boogie-woogie blues for the new millennium.  Meanwhile the Van Halens keep the tune chooglin' along with a good, solid rock n' roll shuffle into a classic Eddie guitar solo wrapping up with a headrush of bass, drum and guitar licks. It's kind of a goofy tune but not bad overall.<br /><br />\\"Big River\\" - I also have an old demo of this song, which used to be called \\"Big Trouble.\\" The music is basically the same, but the lyrics have changed. Still a good song.  It's good to have some official version of this tune.<br /><br />\\"Beats Workin'\\" - The album closer is also a song from the band's early days called \\"Put Out the Lights.\\" The song works better in its modern form largely due to the new lyrics. Wolfie gets a short solo spot with some overdriven bass before Eddie's blazes through one of his signature solos. Overall, not a bad way to end an album.<br /><br />I give it three and a half stars because it is far from perfect. (I couldn't figure out how to make a half star.)<br /><br />The new songwriting style picks up where \\"Me Wise Magic\\" and Van Halen 3 left off - gone are the days of songs with only two parts. I like that as musicians they have evolved, but I would like to hear their take on a simple song. The production is modern and that means loud with some digital overdrive. It's not too distracting, but it's there. Every instrument and the vocals are in their place, but it doesn't sound too polished, for better or worse.<br /><br />Ultimately, \\"Truth\\" documents a band in transition. The album is like a mix of the band's earlier albums \\"Diver Down\\" with its half old/half new feel, and \\"Women and Children First\\" with its punky aggressiveness. Those albums were also transition albums of sorts and that makes me wonder how the next album will turn out, as \\"Fair Warning\\" and \\"1984\\" were strong follow ups, though \\"Warning\\" was a late bloomer.<br /><br />There you go, a lifelong fan's perspective, though VH could drop a turd in the middle of the table on Christmas Day and I would eat it up and find something good to say about it. So take it how you will, but rock on.

B004EPYZPS|5.0|One of the neatest films of the decade. Very great storyline, has an authentic feel to the time the film is based in and leaves the audience wanting more. J.J. Abrams and Steven Spielberg are an amazing duo
B003U0AHBO|2.0|I picked this up for a few bucks in a used DVD bin and wondered why it was there.  Russell Crowe's a top-shelf actor and Ridley Scott has made many a blockbuster and Cate Blanchett is high quality, etc.  So I watched the movie to see what I could see.<br /><br />What I saw was an inept scrambled eggs mess of a movie:<br />a lot of GLADIATOR, much of THE PATRIOT, silly stealings from SAVING PRIVATE RYAN.  The last \\"borrowings\\" were especially absurd: the French landing craft are almost identical to those which transported the troops to the beaches of Normandy in World War Two.  In this movie, the scenes of the beach landing and the soldiers flailing underwater weighted down with their chain-mail and getting hit by a fusillade of arrows is an embarrassing imitation of the opening sequence in Spielberg's film.  We are also led to believe that the \\"Hood\\" of Robin's last name is derived from \\"the Hood\\", the inner neighborhood in which he and his Merry Men thrived.  The truth is that the \\"Hood\\" much more actually refers to the head covering of the cloak Robin was wont to wear.  And risible is the scene where Cate Blanchett's Maid Marian is all armored up and ready to kick the ass of the big bald villain who killed her father - only to get knocked off her horse and get saved by Robin Hood.  Her fall from the saddle undermines the entire scene and makes one realize it would have been less insulting to the fair sex if it were left on the cutting room floor.<br /><br />Settings and costuming and how it all is photographed are all pretty much in keeping with the times, but the contemporized script and the updated landing craft and the attempt to make \\"hood\\" timely all fall flat and cause to come to ruin what could have been a fairly good historical drama. But apart from all else, the one critical, crucial thing that should have been updated but obviously couldn't is Russell Crowe himself! He is much to old for those mythic tights! I had no idea when I popped this disc in that this long, basically boring movie was all just a prequel to the beginnings of the Robin Hood we all know and love - and that is Robin Hood, the Outlaw, the robber of the rich to give to the poor, etc.  Well, Crowe was 46 when this film was made - and that is a way bit past it to be be playing a legendary character who, after the two and a half hour movie, is found just beginning the career that will make him timeless.  Russell Crowe co-produced the movie - and he should have stayed behind the scenes for this one and let some young buck try to bring it home.<br /><br />One other thing: Cate Blanchett (as Cate Blanchett) pontificates in one of the extras and says that Russell Crowe is the first man to truly play Robin Hood and that all the other portrayals were somewhat fey.  I don't suppose she ever saw Sean Connery in ROBIN AND MARIAN or even Errol Flynn as the definitive Robin Hood.  Oh, well.  Talk is cheap.  And so was this movie when I bought it - and sadly after I watched it, despite the millions spent on making it!this long, basically boring movie was all just a prequel to the beginnings of the Robin Hood we all know and love - and that is Robin Hood, the Outlaw, the robber of the rich to give to the poor, etc.  Well, Crowe was 46 when this film was made - and that is a way bit past it to be be playing a legendary character who, after the two and a half hour movie, is found just beginning the career that will make him timeless.

B007I1QUYE|5.0|I was a minor comic book geek as a kid (Marvel primarily, not DC), and I have to admit, I was fairly pleased when the Raimi-envisioned Spiderman series went into production.  The actual comic book was a decent mix of drama, action, and humor, and I was pleased that Sam Raimi did a good job of infusing a lot of those same elements into the movies.<br /><br />I bought the \\"Spiderman Trilogy Blu-ray\\" series just a few weeks ago, after having never purchased ANY of the single movies either on DVD or Bluray (which is actually surprising for me as I enjoyed them for the most part), so there has been a fair amount of time between the recent purchase and my last viewing of most of the series.  I decided to watch all three again over a week, and I have to admit I was pleasantly surprised.  I honestly didn't remember that the whole series was as good as it is.  Is it phenomenal?  No, but it is a solid, interesting, and entertaining presentation of the Peter Parker / Spiderman story.<br /><br />I'm not one of those nitpicks who lambasts every little detail that's different from the actual comic book.  I try to consider the bigger picture, the spirit of intent, so to say, and take the movie production as a whole.  For the most part, this trilogy hits the target.  Tobey Maguire delivers a nuanced but impacting Peter Parker, and Kirsten Dunst delivers the right balance of emotion and spunk as Mary Jane Watson.  The other supporting characters (the Green Goblin, Doc Ock, the Sandman, Venom, Aunt May, etc) deliver with variable impact, but all still carry their weight in the series.  The weaker of the three films is number 3 (as most reviewers, myself included, seem to think), but it's still good enough to ably support the series as a whole.<br /><br />Not sure I would give any of the individual movies a solid 5, but the series as a whole is, for me, a definite \\"4.5 with a roundup to 5\\" rating.<br /><br />Pluses would be the story and character development, with weighty-enough performances delivered by the various actors in the series (especially the mains) and the well-balanced delivery of light and heavy plot lines.  Even when the story gets serious, there's a comical element to the whole delivery.<br /><br />Minuses would be the \\"everything and the kitchen sink\\" approach to the third installment.  There's really just too many story elements that distract from a central theme to sink your teeth into.  It almost works...but not quite.<br /><br />Again, having never watched the entire series in quick succession, I was impressed by how well it held up as a whole.  If for some fluky reason, like me, you haven't purchased any of the previous single titles, this is way worth the buying the series a whole.  Though I somewhat enjoyed the newer 2012 re-imagining of Spiderman, I admit, this interpretation of the story offers something the newer delivery didn't.
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|I think this should be mandatory reading for every world history or political science major.  It is absolutly shocking that this is still happening right now in our world.  You will be shocked, stunned, sickened, and morbidly enraptured with this story.<br />I have recommended this book to all of my family and friends.
0741470314|5.0|Dr. Moriarty's book \\"Defending the King\\" has given me a deep appreciation of the man behind the mask.  Her unbiased research of Michael Jackson's talent and demons is a look into the man's soul.  His love for his children and all the children of the world and the need to be loved to fill the hole of his missing childhood was much misunderstood by the media and abused by greedy individuals.<br />Thank you Dr. Moriarty for taken the time to write this book to tell the world who he really was.  Although he is no longer with us, I now know he can rest in peace knowing that there's someone defending him.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|I was reluctant to purchase this book since I disagreed that such an elite and honor-bound SEAL should write a book about the Bin Laden raid.  A friend talked me into it and it was, of course, a very fascinating and riveting perspective.  However, I still feel that the author broke an unspoken code of silence.  If that isn't an issue for you, then you'll love the book.
B0000TLA9G|5.0|I've always like Guns N Roses and had a couple of their older CD's.  I bought this to fillin & update my collection and have been very pleased with it.  Great songs by a great band!  Whether you have other Guns N Roses CD's or are new to their music, I highly recommend it.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|Very comfortable.  Reasonable price on Amazon.  Wear them on cardio machines at gym and when meditating.  Great sound blocking.  Definitely feel good about the price for the quality.
B001EN71CW|5.0|Firefly is as good as it gets for a television series and this edition is beautifully rendered in the Hi-def format.  My only complaint was that the menus are a bit clumsy to get between episodes and special features.
B005LAIHXQ|4.0|We saw this movie in the theater.  My husband really enjoyed it.  We ordered it from Amazon & he has watched it 3-4 more times.
0547884591|5.0|Tim Ferriss breaks down the process to learn anything in this beautiful book.  This book will tech you much more than cooking all while you learn to cook.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I want to hear more from christians perspective! great last book anyways. very surprised about the pregnancy though. haha. :)
B002RVZV9U|5.0|This is a great insight into the music of giants. I absolutely recommend this to anyone who loves rock. For the record it's worth a lot more than it cost. Buy this you won't regret it!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I live in MN which is central time. Does anyone know the approximate time of when the latest episode is available for download from amazon?
B0019N8P2W|3.0|This is truly an amazing series, I was so exited to receive this at the discounted price!<br /><br />The case arrived damaged, the discs seem to be fine but i'm disappointed. Looking at the reviews I assume its a manufacturer error/warehouse issue.<br /><br />BE AWARE, it's a great deal... I'm still deciding on returning it :/
B000OZ0NXA|2.0|Uncritical readers will find this novel fun and exciting.<br /><br />Discerning readers will see a continuous chain of cliches and implausible events which prevent any suspension of disbelief.<br /><br />Author failed to do adequate research, and thus was unable to convincingly portray the protagonist's background or training.  And the author's research into firearms and their use must have consisted of the Wikipedia results of a Google search for &#34;what is a cool gun?&#34;.  My 9-year-old nephew could describe the use of firearms more accurately than the author.<br /><br />I won't be reading any more books by this author, so I will have to live the rest of my life without knowing if the other books in this series are just rewrites of the same book, as Dean Koontz does.
B009YU9J0E|5.0|This album is great. I highly recommend it.  However, importing to iTunes 11 was nearly impossible so please be careful.  The album showed up under \\"Recently Added\\", but did not show up under the \\"Crystal Castles\\" artist.  I had to delete the imported mp3s, update the id3 tags of the mp3s in the Amazon folder, then re-import.  That said, the album is worth the extra work.
0345529057|4.0|the books are in great condition, but the box they came in is rather flimsy and made of thin cardboard. I thought it would be a sturdier collectors-type box, but it really isn't even worth keeping. But I bought the product for the books themselves, so it's not a big deal at all. the books are in fantastic shape and they're just what I wanted.
B0013816GK|4.0|Always liked the Requiems and this  is very good. A good choice in a more recent performance that are available.
B002FRNCG0|5.0|Good  d e a l,  s h i p p i n g  and  d e l i v e r y
B006LSZECO|3.0|This book was recommended to me by an advocate reader like myself so most of her recommendations are always good. This time around we figured out the difference in our reading type because she seems to LOVE the book yet it was a very slow read for me. I almost did not continue to read it when I got 305 in but she encouraged me to pay attention to all the details and keep reading. So I did because I hardly start a book and not finish it just to say I read it. Again the plot was built too slow for me and had the book at a better ending it would've been worth the slow build. The ending was horrible. It is like she was strategically thinking throughout the book then all of a sudden ran out of time to finish it. I did give it a 3 because it was strategic in that it keeps the suspense going. I could not tell who did it for a while. But I would not recommend this book.
B000PTYPAC|5.0|Good  d e a l,  s h i p p i n g  and  d e l i v e r y
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|A little depressing, but a good read. Makes you wonder what our world could be, if not for people's kindness and responsibility. SPOILER ALERT! Prim's death was really unnecessary, and served no purpose to the story except to drive Katniss certifiably insane and to enrage the readers. END OF SPOILER. Still... it was okay.
0307943259|5.0|well written and read. enjoyable to listen to. You will be amazed at the ending and will enjoy talking about it afterwards
B001CDLAT4|5.0|BRILLIANT, moving, an honor to watch.  I saw it premiered at the World Parliament of Religious in Chicago, with an audience from around the world.  This is not only thought provoking, it is a blessing,  hence the title Baraka.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|This is one of those movies you just have to<br />Pull out each year.  It is a Christmas staple, I never miss it!!!
B004I2K4DY|5.0|I woke up at 3AM and saw part of this concert on PBS.  I sobbed, wailed and cheered.  AND absolutely had to own my very own.  Spectacular!
B009S8PEHY|5.0|Even at 60+, Rod Stewart is still one of the sexiest musicians out there. His voice is pure velvet and the duets are fantastic. This collection is a &#34;must-have&#34; for your Holiday collection!
B000068OCS|5.0|I saw K. years ago in a class.  I had to leave half way through due to its intensity.  Now, I look at it and marvel at how<br />advanced it was and still is:  way before its time.  I would recommend this to anyone who wishes to experience a unique as well as disturbing journey into reality.  +
0810996596|5.0|Great product, colors, pictures. just what i expected. Always arrived at Brazil very fast. I will recomend this products to my friends
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I really liked this book.  It held my attention though out and I was totally surprised by the ending.  One of his best!!  Would love to see a movie of this one.
B009WO7NQO|2.0|this game is so hard! I truely thought that it would be better than Angry Birds Space but I was wrong. Its not my favorit game
B009S8PEHY|3.0|I'm lukewarm about this album.  I listened to it, and an hour later, I forgot all about it.  Usually with these holiday albums, there is at least one track that you want to listen to a few times and add to your favorite playlist.  Not with this one.
B00992CF6W|4.0|well, I find the game fun but its definetly not like the real computer version.<br />The blocks and things are limited but enough to make something cool.
0525478817|2.0|I do not understand why everyone likes this book so much! My reading teacher was really pushing it so I read it, but I was so disapointed! I didn't even come close to crying at the end, like so many people promised me would happen. I thought the characters were overly sarcastic, to the point where it wasn't even funny anymore. The writing was incredibly pretentious; it sounded like the author was just trying SO hard to make this a \\"modern classic\\", but it just didn't quite work. Every other word sounded like the author picked it out of a thesaurus, without actually knowing what it meant. The plot was actually quite boring and cliche, it is honestly just another depressing cancer kid book that didn't even make me cry. The characters were all so completely perfect, and unbelievable, I didn't find myself at all sad when *spoiler alert* one of the main ones died at the end. The best word I can think of to describe this book is OVERRATED.
B004ZJZPXO|5.0|I like this purchase.  all has met my expectations.  but if you want me to review every item, it gets boring cause I feel the same for all.
B00992CF6W|1.0|it wont install plz help mojang plz it would help al ot does any 1 else hag this prob plz
B008CJ0JTI|1.0|.....but how does this dog even rate a DVD version, much less a Criterian Blu-ray release? I saw this POS in the theater way back when and was totally disappointed at how manipulative it was, how transparent it was, and ultimately, how stupid it was. When Sean Penn disappears early in the movie you know right away that he's behind all of it, and then at the end when he pops up and it's all a big joke, I would have shot him right there. Rarely have I left a theater pissed off but to have everything that happens explained away in the end as just a big elaborate practical joke, I just felt cheated. Having a Criterion version of this is the ultimate act of polishing a turd.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|Nothing bad to say here. Everything was perfect, it came on time, brand new. Quality was perfect. I'm very happy.
B003UESJHE|1.0|\\"The King's Speech\\" is a great movie, but the Blu-Ray disc is unplayable on many popular BD brand players, such as Samsung (my experience) and LG (read the other reviews). Apparently the copy protection on the disc is so strong it fools the players into thinking they don't have enough memory to play it. My experience was that the player took nearly ten minutes to grind haltingly through the first ninety seconds of the movie. To add insult to injury, a group of inane movie previews you are basically forced to watch before getting to the main menu play fine. The DVD is nearly as good quality and plays fine in any DVD or BD player. Don't waste the extra money on the unplayable Blu-Ray disc!
B009329ZF2|4.0|If you have liked Taylor Kitsch in Wolverine, you will like him here as well.  Battleship is a fun movie with good puns, an unbelievable storyline (that makes it so worth watching), adventure, redemption.  It's not a big role, and certainly not his best, but Liam Neeson still delivers.  I was surprised how much I enjoyed Rihanna.  She is feisty, cocky, delivers her lines with aplomb.  I suggest to give it a try after a long week on the job and a weekend evening to relax with a glass of wine.
B00936A0RU|3.0|There are many big names in this movie but that does not help the movie at all.  It is a true story about three brothers who live in rural mountains.  They are orphaned and find way to earn their living by bootlegging liquer during the prohibition era.  Before long, mobsters and killers willing to gain share in the profits are after them.  As the competition becomes smaller and smaller it becomes inevitable that these brothers are targeted for final elimination so that big boys can control the market and the price.<br /><br />There are so many moments in this movie when brother's love interests make movie turn sappy for a few minutes, only to go back to being brutal and ruthless again.  After all it was tough times in the 30s and no ne really had time for sentimental stories.  So I guess, Hollywood ruined it again.  If you can put up with the occasional drag, this movie is just OK.  But I would not have great expectations for this movie....
B007SGM084|5.0|From beginning to end in all three books I was captured! I love that this type of genre is out there for the more open minded readers! Now the movie, please!
B009KHDT0C|2.0|Whoever heard of such a thing?  But here it is - a boring vampire.  I just never cared about these characters.  You can't treat monsters like regular folks.
B0014BY72Q|4.0|interesting. reasonable for old time movie. we have come a long way in making movies. I hope they were not using the frozen runners as food supply.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|This show is my absolute favorite.  It is so intense and never dull so many twists and turns. The fact that they make it a new show every season is genious.  I love that I can download this easily to my Kindle Fire and watch it where ever I go.
B002RI9SC4|5.0|I've read this book before but wanted it kindle form. For me it's one of those books you can read again and again loved it.
B0058UXHHK|4.0|I really liked this book.  Yeah, the main character is quirky, like others have stated, but I like that about her - she finally finds herself and I think she likes herself.  Interesting book, for sure!
0545403359|5.0|This is a great book for anyone age 8 to 108! Better than the movie!--but the play at the CivicCenter in Des Moines will be fabulous also.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|A practical distilled version of the mission to get Osama Bin Laden. Like the Navy Seal that he is the book is heavy on action with limited insight as to how they determined the location of Bin Laden. It does address some common misperceptions about the Navy Seals and about the mission itself and serves as a solid historical account of a key event in our lifetimes.<br /><br />While it addresses the key military aspects of the operation it does underplay the importance that intelligence and the political calculations that went into deciding the type of operation that would be mounted. As such Owen comes off as a somewhat egotistical, but as a Navy Seal who treads in places no angels would dare to go, it does take a person of ego with great amounts of courage and skill to do what he and his teammates did. For their part in the mission.........and for this book, he is to be applauded.
B008GFI418|4.0|I've always felt that George Martin was the 5th Beatle and that they created those fantastic songs with his help. So this is a must see if your a fan.

B005QUQP76|5.0|Having been used to another top rated FPS gaming mouse since release date, I was skeptical of all others. I only fooled myself since the logic behind this thought after having to replace it three times due to a short in the cord, thinking it was the best. Before purchasing a product, I  compare to others with specifications, seller claims, buyer reviews on many websites. I came upon the Corsair M60! Carefull scrutiny was a mixed bag, the plus side was the fact that it was a new product (updated technology), trusted name, familiar laser sensor, perfect size, attractive, supposedly super accurate. On the minus side, I knew the sniper button would be a little to get used to since it was placed too far forward and the rewiews stated such as well as the software problem which seemed unanimous.<br />I purchased and gave it a chance inspite of certain reviews and found that the firmware is updated, removing all those complaints. The software is very easy to use and offers anything a gamer might wish for. The size, weight and buttons were to my delight. Yes, the sniper button might require changing hand placement but it is a great feature. Very precise sensor,  same as G9X, lightweight, even with the weights still installed, glides like on air with the glide pads strategically placed.<br />Inspite of the fact that I still have to get used to the DPI button placement as opposed to my prior mouse and the sniper button upon which, you have to strech your finger a tad, I still rate this a five star, as I find no imperfections. The button thing is normal, being used to different placements, it is not a fault of the mouse. I will not give the name of my previous mouse for many years because I don't like to publicly down another product name with my personal problems encountered, since it is only a percentage, and not a 100% total problem.<br />I highly recommend this mouse if you are an FPS gamer (BF3,BO2, Arma II, ect) You will not be disappointed. The sniper button, unce used to is a killer-raised my scores. Software is easy to use ( I have no need for button assignement, as I do that in each individual game). The feel is &#34;just right&#34;. It is USB 3 compatible (only mouse out there) but the USB 2 limit is yet to be reached, I do not honestly know if there is a difference when trying USB 2 or 3. Downloading and installing firmware should be done while plugged in a USB 2 port as recommended, then you can swithch to USB 3 if you want- no problems encountered there.<br />OK, just buy it! If you are a FPS gamer, otherwise I would recommend the M70 meant for  multible macro, and having more user buttons. The M60, after a months use has encountered 0 problems, raised my kill/death ratio, made my gaming experiance more comfortable during long hours, gave me more confidence due to the precision, instant DPI and sniper button usage and precise laser tracking. Amazons price is as low as you will find, plus the advantage of their excellent support which I rarely had to use-never had to ask for RMA throughout the years from them as the products they shipped were usually faster than advertised, exactly as advertised, perfect condition, unbeateable price.
0062060562|3.0|As soon I read that there was a dearth of photos, I knew how the book would end. And it was as I predicted. Anyway, I knew Christine wouldn't be able to put the pieces together so I just kept reading to find out what would finally trigger her to decipher the mystery. In any case, the concept of retrograde amnesia is a fascinating topic, and the author wove a decent intrigue around it. This book was not, however, something I couldn't put down; I finished it in the hope that something totally unexpected would unravel itself at the end and the author would redeem himself. Didn't happen.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|A grown up twilight series historical alchemical references add interest. Keeps your attention and second book is also good. Good read!
B001NEK2GE|4.0|Been using this for some time and I have to admit it makes just about any game much more enjoyable.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Much more comfortable than any gaming keyboard for extended periods of use.<br />Easy macro programming.<br />Hotkey and macros are easily switched from one game to the next with the quick-action profile keys.<br />LCD Screen Displays Countdown/Stopwatch, News Feed, Media Display, Digital Clock, PC Performance Monitor, and Game Integration (with some games).<br /><br />Cons:<br />The joystick on the side is very hard to control if you're going to use it for movement in video games, and becomes uncomfortable very quickly.<br />Does not control the Media player of your choosing, it simply shows what's playing.<br />Very limited Game Integration for the LCD display. Borderlands 2 simply shows the game logo, WoW does show your current stats but that's it.<br /><br />It's an odd major bonus for me, but the LCD clock helps me a LOT with keeping track of time. Nothing worse than playing your favorite game and closing out of it to find out you have 10 minutes to get to work lol. I don't play WoW a whole lot anymore but I can assure you if you're looking to make PvP a LOT easier on yourself, set up macros/hotkeys on this thing and use the mouse to move. I'd also like to point out this is a great tool not just for games but also Photoshop, etc. Saves a lot of time when you can macro one key to activate a tool that would otherwise have you move the mouse around for 4-5 actions or learn what 3 keys to press down in an ungodly amount of combinations. Only deducted one star for the joystick.
B003XF1XOQ|1.0|I wish I had stopped after reading the first book.  There was way too much senseless violence without enough story left to support empathy for the characters.  It became a horrible plotless mish-mash.  Waste of my time.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|It's great on DVD, but blu-ray makes this even more spectacular! I could certainly watch and over again.  I love BBC film products, and this is no exception!

1400069289|1.0|Ok. I read and review books so I thought I would try the paid route. It was short lived.  One of the three books I reviewed was this one. It was actually a test to see how my reviews were. Knowing I was being tested on my reviews I wasn't sure if the book I received which was this one, was actually a book or a mish-mosh mix of a book.  I reviewed a fifty page version of this book. From what I read it was horribly put together. It was like cut up in pieces with zero unifying theme. It was just a bunch of facts strewn together without any emotion or creativity.  Of course in the review you have to say what is good about the book. If not praise it be fair handed with your review. I am here to say if this book is indeed fifty pages long it doesn't have a cohesive theme.  It was written very amateurly.  Just thumbing through the reviews they are all particularly well written with zero spelling errors and zero misspellings, almost like people were being PAID to write them. Gee other books reviewed are usually a little sloppier and at least some are done quickly. It is kind of unusual that all the people who read his book spell perfectly and have perfect grammar.

B0098VXMNE|5.0|I've tried to watch other shows pertaining to the Roman empire, but none grasps the heightened emotions, the sense of urgency, scenery, language, coupled with great acting, quite like this show.  I'm still upset there is only one more season.
B008EZVNO0|4.0|I'm a country music guy but I have always liked Van.  I loved his album of country from three or so years ago.  His reprise of Webb Pierce's 'There Stands The Glass' was outstanding!  'Born to Sing: No Plan B' is not quite the same but enjoyable.  Don Imus recommended!
B003VS0CXS|2.0|It has taken me a while to write this as I opened it a while after I purchased it and noticed that there was a finger print on the Blu Ray disc. The paper cover was also torn. Looked like someone squeezed it too hard and punctured the cover. I was thinking about returning it, but couldn't find the item. I finally decided it was too late to return it so I just decided to remove the security stick-on things. The rectangular black security strip came off as usual, but it also had that white square security patch, which is somewhat difficult to remove, but with some time, it comes off. This one did not come off as easily. Still working on it. Not sure if this packaging is only an issue with just mine, NorAm International Partners, Inc. (whom I purchased it from) in general or if there is a general packaging company, but I was very disappointed with how it was packaged. Would rather spend a few extra dollars and see it not look like a little kid packaged it. In NorAm International Partners's defense, I didn't try to return it within the amount of time I was allowed to return it. Just disappointed in general.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|It was a wonderful and adventuress book and I loved it. But at some parts it was boring and to gorey

B004X75RK4|4.0|This is an enteraining movie however it is an inaccurate portrayal of Sitka Alaska. I think they fimed it in new england.
B009HEJXFS|1.0|This was horrible... save your money. By far the worst one of the series. Go back and watch the first one instead.
1451627289|5.0|If you're looking for a typical Stephen King horror story, bypass this one.  But if you want a great read by a master storyteller, 11/22/63 is a wonderful weekend journey.  Aliens, zombies, and telekinetic power are not here, but a truly engaging love story set in the months before the Kennedy assassination is.  No syrupy-sweet romance novel stuff, though, as King doesn't depend on the relationship between the two main characters for the substance of the book.  Can the hero stop Lee Harvey Oswald?  And should he?  If one aspect of history is changed, how does it affect the future?<br /><br />In all honesty, if King's name had not been on the front cover I'm not sure if I would have recognized it as one of his books.  That does not mean it was not enjoyable.  It's just not what I expected from the king (pun intended) of horror.  Fans of historical fiction will love this one more than horror fans will.  I thoroughly enjoyed it as I am a fan of both genres.
B00AA7O6QC|1.0|Loved the first one.  Sequel was challenging to watch. I wouldn't have watched it to the end if I hadn't paid for the HD rental.  Looking back, I should have cut my losses after the first 15 minutes.  I will watch other movies by these actors but no future expendables for me
0345525558|5.0|I would recommend this book.  My book club read it and there were so many different opinions but we all came together at the end and would recommend it to friends and family.  It was very interesting learning about the different meanings of the flowers and I always believed flowers make a difference in people's lives.

B008ENA74E|5.0|Why I left Godlman Sachs: A Wall Street story<br /><br />Excellent book - a good story, well written but most useful as a primer for how investing does and does not work. The big guys got it very wrong - and they're supposed to be experts. This book taught me that the average person is just a babe in the woods when it comes to stocks. Be afraid - be very afraid.
B004FP1WX0|5.0|Nev's story was captivating to watch as it unfolded.  It is the modern-day social experiment.  You can't but help and feel sympathetic to all people involved. Definitely worth watching!
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I downloaded this for my iPhone so our son would have have something to do when we were at places that required a long wait. He loves it and wanted it for his Kindle so there you are.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|when I was playing it my kindle shut down and when I turned it back on all of my progress gone.when I had gotten so far :'(
B001LM1456|5.0|I love the remake of The Hulk. Loved streaming it on my Roku using my Amazon Prime account. Check it out.
B009NQKPUW|1.0|Trite.  Screaming woman, regimented robot, infantile plot, inane dialogue.  What happened to Ridley Scott?  Alien was the best and this is just about the worst.
B0034G4P8A|5.0|I never even knew this movie would look so clean and clear on the blu ray itself. Its also at an affordable price!!
B004LWZW4W|5.0|When I first saw this movie on regular DVD it started to blur alot on our LCD screen. However when I bought this it made our Tv look like a movie screen!!Great product
B0083SBJXS|5.0|Awesome movie. Great quality and sound!! Best choice and at an affordable price as well!! A Great movie to watch!!
B009S8PEHY|4.0|I am pleased with this new album from Rod Stewart.  It has most of the classics and a couple of new songs
B0085KGGHI|5.0|Muddy is half way through a gig, at the Checkerboard Lounge, when Mick Jagger, Ronnie and Ian rock up. This is the stuff legends are made of. Unplanned unrehearsed off the cuff fantastic music. Sixteen tracks on this DVD, including, Hoochie Coochie Man, One Eyed Woman, Baby Please Don't Go, Flip Flop And Fly, and two bonus tracks, You're Gonna Miss Me When I'm Gone, and Black Limousine. There are also cameo appearances by Buddy Guy, Junior Wells, and Lefty Dizz. This is a real jam session, and Blues lovers, this is one great DVD.
B000SEGUDE|5.0|Extraordinary story, beautifully told.  Yes, I know it's billed as a series of stories within the covers of one book, but honestly, it is one story, threading through time and place.  Set aside a few days, pack some sandwiches and coffee, because you are not going to want to put this down for anything.
1400067820|5.0|Taleb is candid about what to do if you have all the money in the world  -- in his parlance, f*** you money.  He does, and the suggestion would be to follow his example.<br /><br />More easily said than done.  Although he dwells at some length on the intelligence of his ancestors, he is quiet about his own.  I'm a smart enough guy that I don't often encounter people markedly more intelligence except through their writing.  Taleb is clearly one such - a five or six sigma fellow, to use the kind of traditional statisics which he despises.  The former is one mind in three million, the latter one in a billion.  That is, if you believe standard statistics, which would be blind to the existence of exceptional subpopulations such as Jews and Lebanese from Amouin, in other words, standard stats would ignore black swans and get it wrong.<br /><br />Just as it is easy to be to be charitable if you are wealthy, it is easy to be moral and ethical if you are blindingly intelligent.  It is equally easy to have contempt for the ordinary strivers.  Taleb disdains those who have come up via the national merit scholarship, valedictorian, Princeton, Harvard Law School etc. etc. path.  People who are far brighter than the average, yet not so bright that they have the freedom to paint outside the lines of their lives.  People who have a perpetual anxiety, and a need to get ahead of their fellow strivers, and certainly the hoi polloi, by whatever means.  Especially if it means adopting a convenient moral blindness.  He is not shy about naming such shysters by name: Thomas Friedman, Alan Blinder, Myron Scholes, Robert Merton.  It is a long list.<br /><br />Egregiously making enemies is one of the privileges given to those who possess f*** you money .  He proudly recounts the bullet embedded deeply in his father's chest, requiring him to carry X-rays to explain his failure to pass through airport metal detectors.  He talks about his own bodybuilding regime, giving him a sufficiently formidable aspect to discourage physical retribution for his verbal assaults.  He invites the reader to share his prejudices.  He's successful with me.  I can't be him, but I admire him.  I'm the kind of guy with enough experience in business, government and academia to instantly recognize the kinds of phony he detests, but without the intellect to articulate the revulsion nearly so well, or the cojones to beard them in their respective dens.<br /><br />Now we come to the title, \\"Antifragile.\\"  Something is fragile if it an event not too far out of the ordinary can damage it.  A teacup is fragile.  A banking system or a currency is fragile if it cannot withstand the sort of shocks that should be expected over the course of time.  Moreover, fragile things can generally only be worsened by life's slings and arrows.  No chance event is going to improve a teacup. .. it is all downside.<br /><br />A robust system reacts better to the twists and turns of life.  A plastic teacup is robust in the face of children's small accidents.  The Internet is built to be robust.  Composed of electronic components any of which may fail, it has enough redundancy that a message can almost always get through.  There are, of course, exceptions, which the (fragile) government security people use to scare us when they need funding or greater permission to invade our lives.<br /><br />Antifragility is more than robustness.  It is the property of improving under small shocks.  A system of 1000 small restaurants, each of them individually fragile - likely to be forced out of business quite easily - is quite robust.  Whatever happens to the economy, the traveler will always find one which remains open to feed him.  Each failure gives the others an opportunity to learn, to adapt, and to make themselves stronger.  The greatest antifragile system in the world is evolution.  Individuals of a species are fragile, the species itself is at least robust, and life itself is antifragile.  Even great shocks, such as the meteor strike which caused the Permian extinction, serve in the long run to improve it.<br /><br />Taleb relishes his background as a trader, an artisan, a practitioner, a guy who puts his money where his mouth is.  He uses trading as a metaphor.  Situations with a large upside but limited downside he calls \\"convex,\\" or antifragile.  Call options would generally fall in this category.  Conversely, those with limited upside but potentially unlimited downside, such as AIG's reinsurance of collateralized debt obligations and swaps, are fragile or \\"concave.\\"  They break, as AIG did break in the collapse of 2007/08.  The trader Taleb made tons of money betting against the fragile Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.  The upside, if people paid their mortgages, was quite modest.  The downside if they could not was huge.<br /><br />Convex situations provide \\"optionality.\\"  Like a call option, they provide unlimited upside and limited downside risk.  Taleb's major rant is against the elites of our society who can only benefit from optionality.  Investment managers who lose millions in other people's money while drawing fat salaries, then when their funds go bust, as Corzine and Scholes' have twice, move on to other opportunities, leaving the little people to lick their wounds.  Journalists like Thomas Friedman whose beating of the war drums helped draw us into Iraq, but who suffered no loss of any kind when it turned out to be a disaster.  He hates hypocrites like Peter Orszag, who played a role in precipitating the meltdown of 2007, then without shame moved into the Obama administration to supposedly fix it.  Ditto Bernanke.<br /><br />He admires people who are not just \\"tawk,\\" who live the lives according to the principles they advocate, and put up with large amounts of heat in the process.  He names Ralph Nader, Steve Jobs and Andre Malraux among his heroes.<br /><br />How can we apply his lessons to our lives?  As far as money goes, he is a trader.  Trading is generally a zero-sum game.  His advice would be that of his character Fat Tony, \\"Don't be a sucker.\\"  Unfortunately, in just about every trade there is a sucker, somebody on the wrong side of it.  It his hard to find a moral course of action in such a situation.  The dumb guy loses.  He trusts his banker, his broker, and his lawyer.  It is the agency problem - these guys are not looking out for their clients, they are looking out for themselves.  Taleb is indignant, but that's how the world works.  Dumb people don't have much choice.  They cannot be their own banker, broker or lawyer.  A guy like Taleb can.  NB: Google \\"Four Prominent Bastards\\" for Ogden Nash's poem on same.  Wonderful humor, and nothing has changed in 60 years.<br /><br />Taleb therefore advises us how to find convex risks in our own investments.  He doesn't dwell as much on the topic of investments that are convex from the perspective of a whole society.  He talks about why Switzerland works - it is a confederation of cantons, manageable entities - and talks about the benefits of family-owned businesses.  His advice would be that the managers of a business should have \\"skin in the game.\\"<br /><br />Taleb develops his barbell theme from \\"The Black Swan.\\"  With regard to your portfolio, keep most of it in very safe investments (whatever those are in these times - real estate, gold and ammunition?) and make speculations with convex exposure (ie, call options) with a small fraction.  Investing most of a portfolio in \\"fairly safe\\" stuff like AAA rated bonds can turn badly against you.<br /><br />He talks about risks in terms of the Pareto 80:20 rule.  20% of the people have 80% of the money.  20% of those have 80% of that (ie, 4% and 64%).  Focus on those 20%, or 4%.  If they are positive, back up the truck.  If they are negative, short them or get rid of them.<br /><br />Iatrogenics (ya-trow-jen-iks) is doctor-induced disease.  Doctors have an agency problem: it is your body, not theirs.  They have a bias towards action: a doctor who tells you just to wait, it will go away, appears not to be giving useful advice.  They have a financial incentive: they get paid more if they treat you.  In our litigious society they have a CYA incentive.  It is easier to get sued for doing nothing than following the accepted course of treatment.  The upshot is that we get far more treatment than is good for us.  Taleb advises that you ask the question, what would the doctor do if he had the problem, not you?  Odds are strong it would be much less.<br /><br />Iatrogenics comes into play in most professional spheres.  A fund manager cannot be faulted for going into Apple.  Every other fund manager is doing it.  Bernanke cannot be faulted for endless Quantative Easing.  All the other central banks are doing it.  The agent, the paid professional manager, is interested in his next paycheck, not the long term performance of the fund.  He has little or no skin in the game.  So, to him, it is merely a game.  Be glib and facile talking to investors, and move on when the game is up.<br /><br />He lambastes the American system of education, overstuffed with government money, risk-averse, never impacted by the faults in the supposed knowledge it imparts to its victims (`scuse, pupils).  His own education was ideal.  His father let him read pretty much whatever he wanted, and he acquired a superb classical education.  The book is replete with apt quotations from both well known and obscure scholars from antiquity.  He says that everything worthwhile which he learned, he taught himself.  Much of it came while he was hiding out from the civil war in Lebanon.<br /><br />I will refer back to Taleb as I plan the education of my infant son.  One must make allowances; there is an outside chance my kid won't have a five-sigma intelligence.  Still, the principle of taking responsibility, of educating one's self, should apply to any child.  It used to be the standard back in Lincoln's day.  Allow a kid to progress as far as his talents will take him, develop a broad understanding of the world, and avoid the Harvard hothouse flower syndrome which pushes a kid to achieve 150% of that of which he is capable, and leaves him quaking in fear all his life lest the fraud be discovered.<br /><br />I'll revisit this review upon rereading the book, which I plan to do shortly.  It is incredibly rich.  Here I offer just a few scoops of frosting, without even looking back to the cake itself.a zero-sum game.

B007RI56NY|5.0|Love  50 ways, You can finally meet my mom.  Lots of the songs grow on you! Of course the main song Drive By is a hook!
B007V9N5R8|5.0|Mark Wallace and Joe Brady (Pro Photograhers) both recommend this system.  I decided to jump in and purchase it when I saw this bundle.  It was VERY easy to calibrate my 27 inch monitor, and works very good.  I just wish the X-Rite printer profile software was less expensive, but every serious Photograhper needs a color calibrated monitor to work from, and this does the trick.
1451695195|2.0|I looked forward to reading this book as many reviewers gave it high marks. I don't see why.  The author spent about half the book providing details about his life and about half describing his NDE. While he described the visions he saw well  he answered virtually nothing regarding what questions of his were answered, why he was there, if he were judged and why or why not. There are a number of other books that are far better and more insightful. I'm not passing this book on to friends. I'll give it to the library instead.
B0099TJ4YQ|4.0|Well, I love James and his work but this'll be the second time I've paid out for almost the same CD!  A couple of additional tracks that I - like the sycophant I am, felt I couldn't be without.  Still, great stuff and with Larry Goldings and Dave Grusin involved on pianos, how can it miss?  'The River' is my favourite!<br /><br />Happy Christmas, JT!!!
B008LSVLVA|5.0|Assuming you already know you love this artist, let me just assure you the sonic and visuals are superb. An excellent capture of the best show of 2011. This was taped 4 short days after i saw them in Dallas, and it is the perfect souvenir of that great show. Especially, Luminol, the new track from the forthcoming album. It IS the highlight of the show; with Steven writing specifically to the talents of this touring band, a whole new side of SW emerges. Highly recommended.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this it is amazing. My version hasn't updated to the Christmas version though and I don't want to uninstall it because I have a lot of stuff
B0094ZJ7HO|4.0|This is a nice collection of B Sides, and a must for an Elbow completist. But there's no denying two things keep it from being as good as we'd hope. It lacks cohesion, understandably, as a collection of tunes from a dozen different sessions. And it's awfully short. But heck, it's Elbow, and worth it. These songs are all on the slower side, closing time at the pub.
1400049628|5.0|Max Brooks as almost thought of every thing when he wrote this book and has many usfull things in it even if there never were attacking hords of Zombies and it was a joy to read.
B009439HEY|5.0|This is a huge step up from the first Genesis Revisited album! Better performances and compositions all around, and a superb selection of less-played Genesis tunes. And even the much-played Suppers Ready. A stellar ensemble brings the pieces new life, and excellent mixing and mastering makes this a wonderful addition to Hackett's remarkable discography and a great entry point for those who somehow ignored this Genesis founding member's solo career
0307888681|5.0|Man does Max Brooks have some good story lines going on here, this is a very easy and fun book to read. It's all one story but its made up of diffirant storys of what happened to diffirant people all around the world while there is a massive out break of Zombies. I loved reading this book and want to see the move when it comes out in 2013 and hope it's as good as the book was.
140053271X|5.0|I have to caveat my review and say that I have the version from two years ago--not this newest version.  But I had to submit a review even though I couldn't find that version, because I love my Nook so much!<br /><br />I never wanted an e-reader--I was one of those \\"I like REAL books\\" people.  But I received it as a gift before a European vacation and man I was instantly sold.  I've had it over two years and never had a problem.  The touch screen is a bit slow (as compared to my Android smartphone) but I wasn't expecting it to be like that--it serves the purpose it was intended to.  And I like that it's JUST an e-reader.  The e-Ink display doesn't hurt my eyes and it's the perfect size to hold in both hands, or just one (like a medium-sized paperback).  It's also SO THIN!  I was in the middle of reading the Game of Thrones series and man alive, those books are huge!  So glad I had my Nook to read them on instead :).  I LOVE MY NOOK! BEST PRESENT EVER!
0545425115|5.0|This book was such a delightful read. It had me up all night, nervously skimming through the pages, and gasping. Also, I am sure it had other people on the edge of their seat, just shivering with excitement. It was a very exquisite piece of literature. It was not a hard read, and any age between years of ten, and on could easily read, \\"The Hunger Games.\\" It was filled with twists, and sadness, and some parts were depressing. It makes you love the characters that you are supposed to, and hate the other characters. It goes to show that there are some people that you cannot trust, and there are others that you have to trust. It has a bit of romance, which I found lovely, and I think everyone should read this. I loved it, and recommend this.
B007NESBK2|5.0|The sound on this BluRay is exeptional with DTS ES Master Audio 7.1.  Sade is always silky to watch, the sound will blow you away especially with DTS playback capabilities.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Review of “Shades of Gray”<br /><br />Number 1 Son Jed gave me a Kindle Fire for my birthday back in<br />February, and I have found the dang thing to be addictive!  Its best<br />(and worst) feature is that one can go on line with Amazon, order up a<br />book and it is delivered to your Kindle almost instantly, at a price<br />much less that a dead tree copy, and obviously much faster than US<br />Mule.<br /><br />So far, I have ordered up all ten (to date) volumes of the Bloody Jack<br />series by L.A. Meyer, some other historical and modern Mil Sci Fi<br />(including P&B in The 23rd), and I am now on the third volume of<br />“Shades of Gray”, of which we treat below.<br /><br />This series is well written, with very good character development, and<br />while explicit sexually, it is not vulgar.  Perhaps it is somewhat<br />more than a sex manual for a nunnery, but still in relatively good<br />taste.  Its author has written it totally in first person from the<br />heroine’s (Anastasia, or Ana’s) point of view (except for one<br />important aside data dump), and this is, I am sure part of the series’<br />apparent appeal to horny housewives.<br /><br />Another important mechanism that she (the author) used was to describe<br />the male hero (Christian) in great detail (totally a mega hunk, and<br />totally rich and totally talented) while only describing Ana only as<br />blue eyed, brown haired, just out of college with an impressive GPA,<br />clumsy, but a good cook and still a virgin.  This is another mechanism<br />that allows women (the target audience) to more easily fanaticize<br />themselves into her place.<br /><br />To sum up my review, I Like the series and I am learning writing<br />things from it, OK!
0061122416|5.0|One of the most amazing and fulfilling books I have ever read. I will forever cherish this book for it's wisdom and it's character. It is a simple book, but it is a great book.
B009LK6JS2|5.0|Perfect for down time when you're waiting at the car wash or waiting at the doctor's office. Overall a lot of fun.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|I loved the movie<br />The cast is great, the subject so contemporary (baby boomers can not aford to retire so they are finding a &#34;Mexico&#34; of the &#34;British&#34; nature - India<br />The hotelin India is not the &#34;Hyatt nor Marriots&#34;but becomes more than that -becomes the &#34;glue&#34;which binds this group of British retirees<br />It si a nice story - yes some tears some laughter - some tears and all ends well<br /><br />Not a movie for all audience but I loved it (I want now to go and explore India -on a moped...)<br />Bolywood meets British &#34;stiffness&#34; and blends.
B009ZQJ1G4|2.0|No, I actually liked the  movie a lot- unfortunately Amazon.com does not provide a way to rate their own DELIVERY  of the movie. With every movie that I have watched so far on Amazon's streaming service there has been the same problem; lousy sound. I mean , I have to turn up the volume so much just to hear the voices that the feedback through the speakers produces background noise that makes what the actors are saying almost incomprehensible. This is not the film's fault, but that of the provider of the streaming (Amazon). I  do not have this problem with videos and movies downloaded from Itunes. In truth, the movie itself deserves at least 4 stars, but Amazon needs to correct the sound problem and provide a way to criticize its delivery service.
B00006D295|5.0|This was a Christmas gift so we did not watch it, but have seen the movie before. Arrived on time
B009ANP4F4|5.0|Great movie.  Different than the other ste-up movies.<br />Great to see Moose in this also.  He somehow pulls two, three and four together.
1423140605|5.0|My son loved it! A fantastic continuation in the series. Rick Riordan is a great writer for young and old alike:)
0547884591|5.0|I pre-ordered this book months ago, which is typically a sign my high hopes will not be met by the time the book arrives. Instead, I...<br />- opened book at 6pm over dinner<br />- spent the next TEN STRAIGHT HOURS reading it cover to cover & taking notes (much to my surprise)<br />- finally slept for a few hours, woke up, and bought copies for friends/family for the holidays<br /><br />This is the first time in all my years of using Amazon that I have ever written a review. This is the first time in all my years of reading that I met a book which elicited such compulsive curiosity. This is the first time I have been able to instantly implement substantial changes to my behavior after simply reading a book. Get it.
B005J9ZDYK|5.0|A must have for toddlers..... my grandson has been introduced to the Sprout channel at day care, and loves some of the cartoons that we do not have on our cable network.  Shaun the Sheep,  Rory the Race Car, along with a few others  are his favorites....  most of them are UK based cartoons and are hard to find here in the States without purchasing online.  Thanks for having them available for us to buy for our grandson......(Max and Ruby  is the current cartoon that he wants to go to sleep with)
B005KCGIUY|5.0|A fan of Tool?<br />A fan of A Perfect Circle?<br />Maybe just a Maynard fanatic?<br /><br />This album delivers power, an amazing track list that continues to impress from the first to last songs. It's not common to hear female back up vocals behind Mr. Keenan, but this was a more than pleasurable introduction.
B008AK8FHM|2.0|While I am very happy for the author that he has had what seems to be a mystical experience, I find his book frankly annoying in his insistence that his personal experience equals universal reality.  He reminds us constantly that he is a scientist, which supposedly gives credence to his &#34;out of body&#34; experience.  However, he overlooks the very first rule of scientific truth, which is &#34;falsification.&#34;  A scientifc &#34;truth&#34; can only be considered as such if the matter is open to testing, i .e. if theoretically it is possible to demonstrate that it is false.  Dr. Alexander's experience is certainly real to him; but there is not way that the experience can be put to the test of &#34;true&#34; or &#34;false.&#34;  I would have no problem with the book if it were framed as &#34;My personal experience,&#34; without further claim.  Yet it is entitled &#34;proof,&#34; and it is in no way that.  It is truly irritating to have Dr. Alexander insist on the &#34;truth&#34; and &#34;reality&#34; of the existence of what he encountered, generalizing for the rest of us from what is at best his very subjective and personal experience.
B008UFUOH6|5.0|I love this album and can't stop playing it on repeat. If Joni Mitchell's River is your idea of a holiday song that matches your feelings of the season, this is the album for you.  Nothing jangly or overdone.  Just lovely songs, that flutter softly like the snow.  Tracey Thorn's voice is gorgeous and she trusts it to put across a song without relying on vocal fireworks, tricks and ornate gingerbread decorations.  In this season of rushing around and frenzy, this record provides a soothing contrast that fits the reality of the shortened days and long winter nights.

098478280X|5.0|Good preparation for interview. Pretty comprehensive. You don't expect to see the same problem popping up of course but still worth reading. I like that it covers some OOP.
B00063EMJ6|5.0|This is a great collection of his older hits dating back to the 70's.  Had the originals on vinyl, and 8-track and most of the hits are included.  The later songs from the 90's to present are not included but I have these on cd anyway.
0547884591|5.0|I'll admit I have been reading Tim since the Four Hour Workweek. With that said, I enjoyed this book more than the Four Hour Body. It may be because I have more interest in cooking than fitness... (Eating well is living well!) Or it may be because it seems every time I develop an interest in something Tim somehow publishes some article relating to it. (survival section? OK!) Whatever the reason, from the \\"how to gut a deer\\" section to the powdered Nutella (which I did make), this book held my complete interest. I love how it reads like a magazine. Visually stunning is cliche but accurate.

B0084BMUFA|4.0|This is a cute story, great for the season. I love all the various film adaptations too. My only comment is that the author goes off on a lot of tangents, and sometimes the tone is a bit preachy. Not one of my favorites by Dickens, but very clever work overall.
0618836594|5.0|This was one of the best purchases I have ever made!  It was much better than I expected and I will treasure it forever.  I work as a volunteer with the Cuyahoga Valley Scenic Railroad and each year they do the &#34;POLAR EXPRESS&#34; train rides.  This year I was to be a reader and wanted to make sure I had the story memorized &#34;just in case&#34;.  Thank you for your expert handling of my purchase.
B0000VAFO0|2.0|I'm pretty baffled that this series is still going on.  It's kind of like the endless barrage of `Resident Evil' movies out there right now.  Like, why are these still being made?  The first film in each series was decent enough and yet not good enough to even warrant a sequel, let alone a third, fourth, whatever number they are on now.  Really, the fact that these movies are making money (are they?) is confusing to me.<br /><br />But that's somewhat beside the point.<br /><br />`Underworld' is an intriguing (sort of) concept that pits vampires against werewolves in a sort of mafia meets Victorian England setting where they scour the subways and kill each other.  Basically there is a war between the two, a war that has been going on for centuries.  These two species couldn't be more different (or more clich&eacute;d) and so we can see why they don't get along.  The Lycans (werewolves) are interested in a med student named Michael Corvin, and so obviously he becomes the interest of the Vampires as well, especially Selene.<br /><br />Here's the thing; `Underworld' can verge on boring in parts and cheesy in the rest of them.  While Beckinsale looks amazing in a skin tight leather jumpsuit, and the scene where she shoots out the floor is pretty awesome, the action scenes are not that impressive, the CGI can lean towards campy and the chemistry between the two leads couldn't be staler.  The film is dressed up rather nicely, with some really nice production and costume design (Les Wiseman knows his way around a set, that's for sure) but the start to finish production is just off to me.  I walked out of the theater shrugging my shoulders and wishing that I had seen something else.<br /><br />Style over substance is a real issue here, but sadly the style isn't exciting enough to make up for the lack of real story development.
0920668372|5.0|I read this to each of my children over 20 years ago. I bought a copy for each of them as they had there own, wrote a personal note on the inside cover. It almost makes me terry eyed when I read it.
B00005JM1F|4.0|The thing about movies like this is that they could very easily be forgettable and almost unforgivable in their ridiculousness.  I mean, how many movies about reckless middle aged men acting like twelve year olds can you stomach before you swear off the genre altogether?  Still, there is something almost endearing about Will Ferrell and Vince Vaughn that make their shtick worth watching and completely enjoyable.  Sure, even they have had missteps and they can and do get old after a while, but overall their names draw me to them and their films and so that brings me to `Old School', one of their more successful ventures.<br /><br />The film is really dumb, when you look at it from a plot perspective.  I mean, you have Mitch, a straight laced man with a philandering wife who is best friends with two very immature men who are experiencing issues with their wives as well.  After catching his wife in the act (with two blind folded individuals), Mitch leaves home and rents a house near the campus of a nearby collage.  His two buddies are thrilled, for to them this means parties and college girls and drunken mistakes.  Mitch isn't really into all of that (why are they friends again?) but he's pulled into the debauchery and soon finds himself starting his own fraternity in an attempt to save his home (since the school wants to claim it for academic purposes).  His fraternity obviously seeks out the `losers' and becomes a joke until the very end when they prove themselves in ridiculous fashion and all is right in the world (including a happy ending for Mitch).<br /><br />Like I said, it's really dumb and yet it all works together thanks to some really funny jokes and the charisma that Ferrell and Vaughn bring to their scenes.  Ferrell is especially hilarious here, really nailing his take on, well, Will Ferrell (he does play himself or a variation of himself almost always).  The stupidity is balanced out by the humor, which is surprisingly well placed.  Even Wilson, who is a bore most of the time, comes out unscathed thanks to his charming persona and the chemistry he has with his co-stars.  Pompeo (the `other' Renee Zellweger) is beautiful as ever and adds a clich&eacute;d touch to the film (love interest with scuzzy boyfriend).<br /><br />It's not for everyone, and it's not for every mood, but if you like mindless humor with real bite, this one will work.bore most of the time, comes out unscathed thanks to his charming persona and the chemistry he has with his co-stars.

0547884591|5.0|After seeing significant life-changes occur when I incorporated aspects of his previous books into my life, I decided that I had nothing to lose with 4 Hour Chef. I consider myself an average male with cooking skills (I know how to hold a knife, can cook several dishes, and don't feel overwhelmed by a dinner party of four.) I'm learning new skills everyday, and Tim offers great methods to practice and build on previous knowledge.<br /><br />More important to me was his treatise on life-long learning. As a knowledge worker, I'm constantly interested in how to become better at my chosen profession and maintain a healthy brain by learning new skills. Some are challenging for me, such as languages. Tim offers some great ideas on how to overcome these hurdles.<br /><br />Don't buy this book expecting everything to be applicable to your life. Maybe it is, but it would certainly be overwhelming to incorporate it all at once. This is a cook book for life, and will last you many years. As with his previous books, my proof will be looking back a month, a year, several years from now and appreciating the small but noticeable changes. Thanks Tim.<br /><br />Update: 1/5/2013 I've finished the Domestic and Wild sections. I suggest always using a thermometer for every dish; the cooking times were almost always too short. Obviously this is dependent on the tools you're using, so no real surprise. But budget more time into the recipes. Tim's idea of \\"awesome\\" and \\"amazing\\" are evidently different than mine. The recipes are good, are a good introduction to cooking skills, and healthy. I have had no food orgasm, yet.<br /><br />The Wild section was interesting. If you are a hunter, or from a location that hunting is common, you will laugh at this. Where I grew up, we had a name for guys like Tim. They came into town with their $7000 rifle kit (that someone told them was the best), Honda Civic, and Apple Macbook Air, and looked like yuppies. If you are a Tim disciple and do exactly ashe says, you will be that yuppie. You will kill deer, but the locals will 1) admire your gun that costs three times more than most of their trucks, 2) be nice to your face, and 3) laugh later. Now, many hunters have $7000 rifles, but after graduating from other guns where they learned their skills. For a book about learning, I felt this was shallow. But again, it's not a book about hunting, so I wasn't completely surprised. Again, with a $7000 rifle, you will kill deer.

1401233791|5.0|This book is definitely awesome.  However, if you want to read the entire Knightfall story arc you will need to start with some other books.  I had read a few of these back when they came out but since the release of The Dark Knight Rises, I wanted to read the entire story.  First you need Batman: Sword of Azrael.  Then you can start with Knightfall Vol. 1.  Volume one starts with Bane's origin.  After the origin story the next issue in the Vol.1 TPB is Batman #491.  For some reason they left out Batman #'s 488 through 490.  These are prelude to Knightfall.  They give back story to how Bane comes about his plan for Gotham and how Azrael gets involved in the first place.<br /><br />So to recap: 1) Batman: Sword of Azrael. 2) Knightfall Vol. 1 (first story only), Insert bookmark, and 3)read Batman #488, 489 & 490. 4) Resume Knightfall Vol 1.<br /><br />488 - 490 can all be found here on Amazon but 489 is a little pricy for some reason.  Apparenty there is something collectible about it.  I don't know if there are variant covers or what but you can find issues in good condition for $6 or $7 if you dont want the collectible version.

B002ECJZ76|5.0|A wonderful and heartwarming family classic that is sure to become a Holiday favorite.  Appropriate for all ages, with spectacular scenery and an enchanting musical score.  Although produced in Finland, the English dubbing was done with great precision with vocals appropriate for the characters.  Highly recommended!  DVD was in perfect condition and arrived within a few days.
B009369Z8A|5.0|I LOVED this movie. I'm very surprised there are negative reviews considering all the action and even comedy at times. I guess some people don't like action and violence, that might be why they didn't like it. I thought the acting was top notch and loved the character Forrest!

B009YP9L7U|5.0|Mira Lyn Kelly turns romance into sizzling reality! I fell in love with this book straight from the start. The character of Conner was just too good to be true, successful, sexy, caring, understanding and charming as hell and a man after every woman's heart.<br /><br />The author takes the rather unconventional character of Megan to turn Conner's life upside down and visa versa. They marry during a night of drunken stupor in Vegas.  But Megan has her life all figured out and being married to Connor is not part of the game plan,but with absolute exquisite passion and some very sneaky moves Connor manages to convince Megan they can make it work, and he will not give into a divorce.<br /><br />The author completely blew me away with the intense passion between Megan and Connor. She weaved the emotional spell of strangers falling in love and ultimately gaining so much more from each other than their previous lives had to offer.<br /><br />I loved how the author used each and every bit of Connor's sexy as sin charm to lay it on thick in each instance he could find,to turn Megan's insides to jelly.<br /><br />Both characters were fun,delightful and the dialogue was crazy, fun ,fresh, funky and modern. I simply adored how the author not only let us in on the feelings and thoughts of Megan but also that of Conner,giving me as reader a better insight into each one's emotions and POV.<br /><br />And last but certainly not least,I loved,loved the way the author made this read real ,she used her very uniqe writing technique to let me as reader feel as if I was reading true life romance rather than fiction.<br /><br />This was fun and sexy romance and is guaranteed to put you into a romantic and flirty mood.<br /><br />Waking up married has never been this sexy.<br /><br />5/5 star review
B000X1Z0BU|5.0|Love this movie. Cute story line that doesn't have some fake hollywood taint to it. Not one sex scene. Poor hollywood is shaking it head with it's tried and true methods. However, it still portrays, passion for life, struggle, awkward human emotions, survival, and accomplishment. Last, the end doesn't leave life in a pretty bow tied package. There are still struggles going on through the successes. This felt refreshing.<br /><br />It also feels so honest from a musical perspective because they aren't &#34;real&#34; actors. They are &#34;real&#34; musicians. It makes the movie more authentic. (I always hate watching an actor pretend to play an instrument with bad technique. It becomes so distracting that I can't even hear the music.) The music written for the movie is nice too!<br /><br />Woo-hoo independent film makers!

B003JTHWJQ|5.0|So nice to hear someone giving information without the shade of a religious fantasy. Simple straight forward information that begs the reader to sit and rethink the religious templates society has handed them. You begin to see that &#34;picking and choosing&#34; of scripture belongs to believers as well as heathens. If they only knew what they were following...

159562015X|4.0|Focus on your strengths, not on fixing your weaknesses.  I love how they show how it is much more profitable to invest energy in developing our strengths instead of correcting our deficiencies.<br /><br />It seems like today that there is an obsession with people's shortcomings.  Doesn't it make a lot more sense to find out what your strengths are and HYPER focus on those?  You will definitely be more successful and happy if you do.<br /><br />What is really the best part of this book is your code to take the test.  This is a very thorough test that is worth the 30 minutes.  It then gives you the top 5 themes of your life.  As you dig into the detailed report, you will be shocked how much it \\"knows\\" you!  It helps you to understand yourself better and can help you understand why others are the way they are.

And boy does it fall exacty into what I want from a novel about the culture. A novel that i could not put down until it was done and then one of those reading experiences that when finished you wish had another 1000 pages of the same.

0553386697|4.0|The Whole Brain Child was written by Daniel J. Siegel and Tina Payne Bryson. Siegel received his medical degree from Harvard University and did his postgraduate education at UCLA, where he studied child, adolescent, and adult psychiatry. Bryson earned her Ph.D. from the University of Southern California, where her research included attachment science, childrearing theory, and interpersonal neurobiology. They share scientific information on children's brains and what makes them different from a fully developed brain. The book is helpful to those who interact with children and was very interesting for me. I enjoyed reading it because I received a lot of new knowledge about the development of the brain and how it reacts to certain emotional situations, especially the brains of children. I feel like it has improved my understanding of children and helped to better my interactions with them. The book is an easy read and presents a lot of detail through charts and diagrams of brain activity, which really helps illustrate their concepts and ideas.<br />The Whole Brain Child tells us that brain research continues to show that childhood is a necessary time of growth and that every single experience affects the brain. The strategies the authors present help us to understand the necessity to develop a strong connection between a child's logical and emotional parts of their brain. This assists them in managing and considering their feelings and behaviors, and to help us develop an understanding of them as well. The book presents 12 strategies to help children's brains develop effectively. The authors tell us that there are many different parts of the brain with their own function, but it is essential for these parts to integrate and work together. The first two strategies are about right and left brain integration. The left side of the brain controls logic, and the right side of our brain controls emotion.  The authors tell us we can help with this integration by connecting with children's emotions. When a child is upset, we should help them link their emotions to events to understand why they feel a certain way. The next three strategies are about integrating the upper and lower brain. The top of our brain lets us think about our actions, and the lower part of our brain is instinct and survival. By integrating these parts, we develop opinions and morals, and this will shape how we act in an instinctive situation. The next two strategies tell us that remembering how events affect us positively and negatively is important to children's brain growth. Instead of ignoring something that happened because we do not like how it made us feel, we need to remember that experience to help our brain learn from it and grow. The next three strategies tell us that children need to accept who they are to be able to make decisions that are best for them in their own life. The last two strategies are about how essential it is to create relationships with others to help children think about how their decisions affect not only them, but others around them.<br /> This book connects to what we are learning in our course because it is all about the brain. The book focuses mostly on mentalism because it suggests that our brain is responsible for our logical and emotional behavior. However, the book proposes that our brain can still partly be shaped by experiences in our life and that as we are growing up and developing, our brain can also go through some changes from outside influences. We learned in our course that each part of our brain has different specialties and functions, and that connects to what the book is saying about each part of our brain being responsible for different thoughts and behavior. All parts of our brain need to work together to keep our brain healthy.<br /> I really enjoyed reading this book. It gave me great insight on how to better understand children and how they deal with their emotions in different situations. It was especially useful to me because I work with kids. I am a dance teacher and a camp counselor for kids as young as five years old. Sometimes it can be very difficult to understand how they are feeling and how to deal with them when they are acting out. My first reaction is to yell at them and discipline them when they do something wrong. However, after reading this book, I now realize that this is not the best approach. Growing up is an important time for a child and everything for them is a learning experience. They do not exactly understand why they feel a certain way or why the do the things that they do. The book has taught me that this is because their right and left brain aren't working together yet. Their brains aren't fully developed yet to help them take a step back and think logically about a situation instead of just to instinctively react emotionally. When a child is upset and acting out, you cannot just yell at them. You need to connect with them emotionally before you can talk logically with them. If you right away ask, \\"Why did you do that?\\" or \\"What were you thinking?\\" they will not be able to give you a logical response. Their first reaction is to act on their emotions and to take their feelings to the extreme. Once you acknowledge their feelings, you can connect with them. Then you can ask them why they feel that way or why they did what they did. Once you respond with the emotional part of their brain, they will be more comfortable when you try to connect to the logical part of their brain. This book was a good read and was helpful to me especially since I work with children. It explained how children's brains work really well and even tried to be specific to different age groups. It was really easy to understand, even for someone who knows nothing about neuroscience or the brain. However, I felt like the book was more directed towards parents, and I read this book for a neuroscience class. I give this book 4 out of 5 stars.

B009OYSFDM|4.0|i like it ,however i did not know that i could get this free from cw tv,i think i should be remburst for the four orders i charged to my  amazon card
B008AK8FHM|3.0|This is a good book but, at times he goes on and on with medical terminology.  The areas where he gets into the technology of the brain etc... is too long and too complicated for the average reader. I found myself paging forward past these areas.  When the book comes back into his family and what is happening on a personal level the book is very good.  I feel it is worth the read but be ready to either go slow through the medical descriptions or page forward.
B0095R64AO|3.0|The story line was good and there were several key funny parts. However, the movie was way too drawn out.
0425263916|5.0|I absolutely loved this book, and the first book Bared to You. I love how Sylvia Day writes in a way that makes you feel the emotions that are happening in the book. I CANNOT wait for the third book. This one definitely leaves you wondering and wanting more! I laughed some, I cried some, my heart wrenched for Eva and Gideon and i'm just in awe of how amazingly it is written! Come on Sylvia get that 3rd book out!

B0068LYEHA|5.0|Author ranges from silly to brilliant with lots of stops in between.  Warning: those who believe women shpould not be strong, funny and in control of there lives will probably be offended.
B002ZG997C|4.0|The Book of Eli is a great movie with an amazing preformance by a great actor.  The movie itself I never get tired of because of the great action scenes inculding the fight scenes.  The plotline is what makes the movie so watchable because he has a purpose to delieve the book to a safe place for others to enjoy the book and learn from it.  It was on of Denzel's better roles and the supporting actors add to the movie and I have never grown tired of the movie over time.  I reconmend this movie to anyone who enjoys a great action movie with wonderful actors and the Bible plotline was very powerful to me because of what I believe in.  We have to \\"walk by Faith not by Site.\\"  So if your looking for a good movie to enjoy on a night off then pick this movie up and watch it and enjoy the message it contains.  Like the book teaches us \\"Do for others more then you do for yourself.\\"
B0076DCT2G|1.0|This is the worst Nelson DeMille I've ever read. The entire book is one,long prelude to several chapters of action. The build-up to final action in the Middle East is completely unrealistic and frankly, boring.  I bought this novel because it's huge and I looked forward to a long, engrossing read. Unfortunately, it wasn't.
0399226907|5.0|Classic. My son started to say the Chinese word of caterpillar soon after I read the book in Chinese to him. He just turned 20 months and wants to pick his favorite books before bed time, and this is always a winner. The format of the book appeals to young children naturally; colors, cut-out holes, simple story line with counting games. Every parent should get a copy of this.
B0001CCXZW|5.0|I love Gilmore Girls.  The DVD's came quickly and they were in great brand-new condition.  No cracks to any of the holders, so nothing was damaged.  I bought it to replace the first season that I bought when the DVD's were first released (I lost one disk) so it was an amazing deal for the money.  Playback is fine.  All in all, great buy.
0060987464|5.0|I have to give this book 5 stars due to the fact that it kept my attention, and it was the first book I actually finished reading in a long time.

B009JBWOU0|5.0|Can't ask for a better deal. You get in my opinion, one of the best trilogies of all-time for only 20 bucks, and you get a digital copy, which means you can watch these movies at your leisure. What more could you ask for? Dont hesitate just do it!
B009K45Y62|5.0|In my opinion Tom Hardy's performance as Bane was one of the most underappreciated performances of the year. The biggest complaint i heard from people who did not like him as a villain was that they could not understand him. Well now with subtitles people's admiration for Bane will drastically increase I hope. Such a unique voice that contrasts with his figure producing quotable line after quotable line, Bane was just as entertaining a figure as the Joker in a very different way. I am hoping people will see that now that they will be able to better understand what he is saying. I hope the movie as well gets its due. It's not as tight of a script as TDK and it does have some 'but why?' moments that you would not expect from Nolan,but it was still a fantastic conclusion to one of the greatest film trilogies of all time. Not many film series have a part 3 that is anywhere near this level of greatness. I couldnt be happier with the conclusion.
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|Great movie and great to have it home to share with my grandson!  I hope to make this a holiday tradition.

B000GRUS22|5.0|I am a big fan of Enigma and am steadily collecting all the catalogue! I actually bought the digital version on iTunes - but wanted the physical CD. The music is hypnotic and trans- like - very Enigma!
B007IXWKUK|3.0|Good writing, horrible plot... Vivid details, descriptive passages, but there is no real plot. Just a love story with a hint of mystery.
B002D0L0R2|4.0|Love it. Didn't realize it wasn't in a case tho. That is a slight storage issue because it gets lost inbetween other discs in my cabinet.
B009FZFONO|5.0|Sometimes gory but the concept of how we would behave if such a thing would happen is believable!  The actors make you really root for them to succeed and others make you want them to fail.  It has me hooked!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Awesome game but a little difficult to me! I love the fact that it has plenty of games though! Great way to waste some time before I go to bed.
B00062IDCO|5.0|We now have all seven seasons and usually watch them over again once a year.  Great concept, great characters.  Wish it could have gone on longer.
B008JAGZDE|4.0|This was just as funny as any of the other movies in the series.  I would watch it again the next time I need a big laugh.
B005FJ7DOM|1.0|series walking dead got me into the zombie thing.  This was poorly done in every way.  The visual part drug and the acting was poor.
B009329ZF2|5.0|I was really surprised how much I liked this movie.  It had special effects, it had action and the acting wasn't bad.  I might even buy a copy of this one.
B009NXD90I|4.0|Again it was wonderfully acted.  Had superior actors, that few today can match.  It made one feel for the characters and what they were doing.
B008Z9YLV2|2.0|I guess I didn't realize the story was written for a 14 year old audience.  It was ok, it just wasn't as good as I was expecting

B00AA7O22U|3.0|Yes there was action and yes there was cameo appearances from every action star, but overall it was not very good.
B00866H7SS|4.0|I really enjoyed reading the book, 'Bared to you' cant wait for the final installment of the Crossfire trilogy. Thank you!
B00129H7VS|5.0|I bought this as a birthday gift for my boyfriend and he loved it! The picture quality for it is amazing and I even got into it with him.
0439023491|5.0|Just like Hunger Games, Catching Fire drags you into this world that you can't seem to be torn away from. The characters and the world is so vivid and easy to read about, you can easily lose track of time! I did! If you haven't read Hunger Games (or just saw the movie) before picking this one up, I HIGHLY recommend you do! The first book puts down a wonderful foundation for the rest of them!
B009J2VR3Y|4.0|I don't know if was deliberate or not; but there is a section that goes blank on the CD; then the music begins again.  Maybe they made it like that to keep it from being used as a high-dollor memorabilia of Whitney; I don't know. I enjoyed the singing and I will just use it as-is.
034580404X|1.0|There was brilliant marketing behind this book trilogy.  The writing and plot are much less brilliant than the marketing.  I feel dumber for having read it.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|I love to get in Reacher's world and follow him anywhere. Nebraska, Kansas, empty highways and weird bunkers are all entertaining and interesting in his company. Cruise haters, get over it, and stop blaming Lee Child and Jack Reacher. They still thrill and break your heart, and you know it.

0547884591|5.0|I have read all 3 of Tim's books and each has had a huge impact on my life. His writing teaches, inspires and encourages people to improve in all aspects of life. The 4-Hour Chef is no exception. It's not just about cooking, though it did make me a better cook. It promotes meta learning, cooking skills, health (Slow-carb diet recipes) and environmental concerns. I have no doubt whoever reads this book will become a better version of himself/herself.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Excellant book.  The author did a great job of keeping you into the book all the way to the end and then wanting to buy the second one.

B000N2HBSO|5.0|As is the case for many who have just posted reviews, I read this book to see what Spielberg used as his historical source for his movie \\"Lincoln.\\" I was surprised to see that the whole movie is based on the final two chapters of the book, and that much of the movie focuses on content and characters -- especially around the passage of the 13th Amendment -- about which the book does not go into great detail. At any rate, it is difficult to understand the motivations of the characters in the movie without the greater understanding that the book provides. So to get the full impact of the times, I think it's best to read the book and then to see the movie. Each makes the other more meaningful and enjoyable.<br /><br />As for the book and Doris Kearns Goodwin, who I have admired for years in her television appearances, \\"Team of Rivals\\" seems to be more than a history. It focuses on our own times and the need for working together to escape political catastrophes then and now. Ms. Goodwin spends the first half of the book establishing the political context of the time. She points out that Lincoln's generation felt cheated that there were not more important things for them to accomplish compared to what the Founding Fathers had done to establish the nation. But the Founding Fathers had failed to resolve the slavery question, and it was left to Lincoln and his cabinet to solve it -- an issue that would prove much more challenging.<br /><br />In my mind, Goodwin uses this example as a parable for our own time. Does the need to end slavery compare to our own struggles with the inequality of classes and the end of the American Dream? I'm not sure. I guess each generation feels it is caught in some upheaval that is worse than what others faced. She holds Lincoln's example up to us to lead us out of our troubles, which also seems to be the primary reason Spielberg produced his movie at this time. The message is for our current leaders to work together as Lincoln and his cabinet were successful in doing.<br /><br />The other thing that was interesting about the book was the way Ms. Goodwin worked through her topics by finding primary sources from important people at the time -- diaries, letters home, and other personal descriptions -- that helped her to write as though she was personally observing those historical events. In addition to simply reporting on the events she was able to analyze why and how Lincoln was able to find just the right solutions not just for the political and military events of the time but also the personal hopes and aspirations of his cabinet. The point is made over and over in the second half of the book how Lincoln's character and empathy enabled him to handle impossible situations with great skill. Using this approach, Ms. Goodwin paints Lincoln  as the greatest leader in our history.<br /><br />I read \\"Van Gogh: The Life\\" a year ago where the authors took a similar approach to psychoanalyze Van Gogh. Like Goodwin's book, the Van Gogh book is over 800 pages long. They explored Van Gogh's own daily letters to his brother plus other primary sources to look at every aspect of his life. When you get that close to anyone, you're bound to dig up a lot of dirt. In fact, that book was quite negative about Van Gogh, and many admirers of the painter were upset that the authors had trashed their hero.<br /><br />Which makes Lincoln's story all the more remarkable. Ms. Goodwin has done a tremendous amount of research here and what she has presented portrays a President who is even greater than we had all learned in our history classes. It is timely reading for our own generation when we need people to think beyond the politics and act like leaders.ere successful in doing.<br /><br />The other thing that was interesting about the book was the way Ms. Goodwin worked through her topics by finding primary sources from important people at the time -- diaries, letters home, and other personal descriptions -- that helped her to write as though she was personally observing those historical events.

B009HEJXFS|4.0|Some of the effects in this movie seem like rehashes of the first two however it did have flashes of entertaining moments. This movie did have an insightful ending. The ending does have a sense of closure about it. Hopefully the producers leave it at that and do not turn this into a Rambo or Rocky type of scenario. Three of these is enough.

I believed the motivations and hesitations the H/h had about continuing their relationship.<br /><br />The book is very well written, and a fairly quick read. Well worth picking up.<br /><br />This will make me want to try more of this new line from HQ.

0812984412|5.0|Cloud Atlas is one of the 10 greatest novels I've ever read (and I read a lot!) Deeply human, the novel explores our connection and the effects of disconnection. Subtly, David Mitchell holds a mirror to some of the deepest shadows of the current Western culture, projecting those shadows in the future for the reader to consider possible futures, desired and feared. But, this novel is no polemic; the reader will not find political rants. Our own politics, past, present, and perhaps future are woven into the weft with deep craft. It's clear to me why the Wachoskis wanted to make this into a movie. Read the book first - it stands monumentally on its own terms.<br /><br />The writing craft in this book is truly astounding. Each historical voice reflects the ideas of its time just as much as expounding a particular character's viewpoint and internal process. That alone would be astonishing; each of these voices is entirely unique; each rings entirely true both as distinct being, but also in it's particular culturally defined cognitive perception. But that's not all: each voice is written in the language of the time. Again, these all ring true. I have read a great deal of mid-19th century literature, as well as 1930s, 70s. Mitchell nails these distinct views so that one is brought into these historical periods completely. That's the setup to reveal the truth from the future he outlines, as frightening and abhorrent as that future is.<br /><br />If you are committed to the current conflation of corporate economy and representative state, Cloud Atlas may very well rock your world.
B009TZ7WDK|5.0|Just a great duo album. They both have truly amazing voices and their journey and story together really comes through in the music as well as their clearly defined talent.

B000FC1HBY|5.0|As in the first book the style remains the same. You don't read chapters of a saga but rather chapters of what is happening to various characters in the book. And the number of characters continue to grow! But isn't real life made of lots of people interacting and creating situations that affect others? My impression is that the books are written in a \\"TV Soap\\" style. We see things happening to various characters in their day to day challenges. Like in real life, the good don't necessarily succeed. Some characters you get really wrapped up in. My favorites are Tyrion, Jon, Daenerys and Arya. When I hit one of those chapters it is hard to put the book down. If you are looking for a more focused plot, you will be disappointed. You do get a sense that the plot will evenutally revole around the conflict between the enemy north of the wall, Daenerys and her dragons and the people we are currently reading about south of the wall. But for now it is a story about different individuals and how they are coping with the various pressures created by the triangle of conflict. This is not a bad thing. You sympathize for the characters in their decisions to try to deal with their situations not knowing all the details. It reads like real life situations. As the first the book is very long, almost three times a regular book. What is great, the author does not repeat or re-explain details to fill the book. It also means you really need to keep track of the characters. The book is well worth the money. Looking forward to start book 3 !
0345803485|3.0|I think we as readers wanted to know more about Christian and why it was like he was. To me this was no better than reading any romance novel except it had more sex.
B004FRX0MY|1.0|Amazon, please fix this so it can store music on an external sd card.  I do not have room in my internal storage for all my music, and manually moving the music from internal to external results in duplicate folders and songs, and is a pain in general.
B0058YPGVQ|5.0|Great season, has a decent amount of extras, wish there was more comenntary, but thats not something amazon can fix.
B00180R06I|2.0|To be honest, I did not like this movie.  I found it boring and the storyline to be absurd.  I cannot recommend it.
B0053O89WY|5.0|Love the show, but I wish there was more special features on the dvd. Other than that another great season of BBT.
B00003CXCQ|5.0|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is the first Disney feature film and one of the most enjoyable for children of all ages.  The picture transfer on this DVD is better than on any other DVD version put out by Disney studioes-includind the Blu-ray.  In other words, this is the version to own.
0547884591|5.0|I've been going through the 4-Hour Chef for the last couple weeks and I am blown away with the quality of the physical book, the images, and Ferris' conversational writing. I am a fan of his previous works, yet this book I am the most excited about because I feels gives me limitless potential.<br /><br />If you are a fan of 4 Hour Body but were looking for more in depth recipes and cooking tips, this book is for you.<br />If you are a self-proclaimed Jack of All Trades and want to sharpen your skills, this book is for you.<br /><br />Don't judge this book as it was a cook book, just go on the journey Ferris is providing and have a blast.

B008MG1E4A|3.0|Leaves a feeling of &#34;wish there was more.&#34;  More, being depth rather then lenght.  I assume this was primarily done by a ghost writer.  If so I would have preferred a third person narrative.  There is no doubt that the SEALS are heroes who we should honor and cherish.  Ijust wish the book was as reat as they are.

B009G7ZYPY|4.0|I love Susan Boyle, but I feel that the producers have zapped what we loved about her, that she was feisty and spunky and funny and had amazing singing chops.  Why not include at least one uptempo and/or one comedy song?  My favorite on here is the duet with Donny \\"This is the Moment\\".  They took a song which is usually done over the top and bombastic and made it beautiful and still powerful.<br />I would like to see Susan and the producers do some original songs too.  My still all time fave song of Susan's is \\"Who I Was Born to Be\\".<br />Give Susan some of her zip back.<br />Still, am so happy for her and her career!!<br />Keep singing with the angelic voice God has given you!!
0547884591|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo3SKNAPSQHD98U]]Amazon tells me to be detailed and specific but to aim for between 75 and 300 words... so here goes:<br /><br />The 4 Hour Chef is as badass as Jet Li storming through your kitchen with 30 ninja's chasing after him.<br /><br />Okay want it to be more specific?<br /><br />Tim takes you through the ultimate 80:20 hack in how to learn skills through the vehicle of cooking. I personally didn't care to learn to cook (have flatmates who are skilled, interned at Michelin Star Restaurants and love to cook), but then I read just how damn simple some of the recipes are in the book, and I just was itching to try it out.<br /><br />Even if you don't want to learn to cook, the section on Meta Learning more than covers the price of the book. No-one, and I mean no-one has distilled learning into such a simple formula in my entire life. I can't wait to take the time of Christmas to see how I can apply that to my final year MSc in Physics.<br /><br />This is probably Tim's best work yet. I as a reader could tell he poured almost everything he had into it, and had damn fun doing it.<br /><br />Buy it. Read it.<br /><br />It's fun.
1455502758|3.0|I chose a three star rating because of the fact that it was very good writing, but the book didn't flow in one clear direction and the ideas were jumbled together. It's a very short read, easily accomplished in under an hour, and you may be best served to purchase a used copy.

B009RX8MQ0|4.0|I love Revenge! The first season was so exciting, and now season two is even way better! Still with drama, twists and a lot of mystery, the show still pulls off some amazing episodes. And this is just the second season!<br />Now we get to know more about Emily's origins and less about the Graysons (thank god), and we also get to explore a little bit more of Nolan's life in Nolcorp, and some new characters from the past of the characters.<br />I think Revenge is one of these shows that you'll never get tired of watching, no matter how many times you watch a certain episode, it's entertaining, with a talented cast and an amazing location: The Hamptons.<br /><br />It's worth the pre-order, and I still can't wait to see how this season unfolds!
B009IJJ5B4|3.0|Decently enjoyable to watch, pretty good rapport between main characters, and alright evolution, thus far. It is Sherlock Holmes lite.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I really like Walking Dead.  I thought both season 1 and 2 were great.  I am only a few episodes into season 3, but it is already better than season 2.  I highly recommend it!
B006LSZECO|1.0|Starting out, this book read great. Thought it was gonna be a great read and the negative reviews were not true BUT once you start getting to the end of this book, it's absolutely terrible. You realize you've wasted all of the time you invested in reading this and you're left with an author just looking for a way out. Not worth the money for the book, I wouldn't pay more than $5 for this read.
0547884591|5.0|This is the third book I've purchased from Tim Ferriss.  Enjoyed the other two but I have been really waiting for this one.  I love to cook and I wanted to see if Tim could bring something new to the table (hehe).  I was not disappointed.  Funny, informational and a different view from the normal cookbook stuff that's available all over.  The book is huge and it's packed with such detail, lists, suggestions and really interesting ideas.  A lot of work was clearly put into the writing of the book and 4 Hour Chef was the result.  Excellent!  I'm only on page 800ish and I have so many notes of things to try.  I bought it for my nook (downloaded it from Amazon and converted it for the nook).  Great book!
B002MQYOFW|3.0|Enjoyed this book thoroughly, though it was predictable at times.<br />It expounded on what the movie couldn't have covered.<br />Good plot...even of it was emotionally confusing.

B000JQU1VS|5.0|I love these stories and the ridiculous fun that they are.  True that it isn't always believable and you have to let your imagination get stretched a few times, but if you are okay with this then you will have a grand old time.  It is easy to read through a short story in one night (sometimes a few) so be ready to just sit down and get one done.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|This was a bittersweet story of love and loss.  I could relate to the mother in regards to being a caretaker to your child.
0553801473|5.0|This a very good book and it's part of an amazing series. I highly recommend reading it starting from the first book A Game of Thrones.
0307352145|1.0|I am brazilian and I read this book in portuguese. I bought it by its title and some excellent revews written in the major local newspapers. I thought it was a behavioral book never a self help one. In the cover was written \\"more than one million books sold\\" ! Very enticing!<br /><br />Unfortunately its content was a total deception. Full of stories written in a very simple, crowded and boring style, the autor gives us too many arguments for little reasoning. The book is messy and at the end reveals nothing really knew or at least \\"empowering\\".<br /><br />In short I'd like my money back.

B000ICLHIE|4.0|If you enjoy Tom Waits and his quirky songs, you'll probably enjoy having the deluxe edition of this three disc set with booklet. As usual, it comes with lyrics and notes, but the most amusing part of the booklet are the random photos. Things that look like pee stains, garbage, etc. It's odd but characteristic of Mr. Waits's sense of humor.
B0084P9202|5.0|A great listen! It soothes your mind and soul while not distracting you too much from life and that which you must not forget.
B005LAIHY0|2.0|This is possibly the most disappointing flick in science fiction / horror since Godzilla. There is no connection forged with any of the characters. If you feel anything for them at all it would have to be annoyance.<br />  I'm sorry to say this film was an exercise in hubris for Scott. Hopefully his investors will have someone watching over his shoulder next time.
B004T4KKSA|5.0|A fascinating book...very well researched and written.<br /><br />Yergin expertly draws out the complications and the interconnected nature of the oil business. From humble beginnings to an industry that has shaped modern history and social order, this is must read for any follower of 19th and 20th century industry or politics.
1475143389|5.0|This book is great!  I have read a lot of books on strength training in the past but they really are all the same.  This book is a no nonsense, get back to basics kind of knowledge that a lot of us need.  I think we are all getting caught up in all the new fads that are out there and now it is time do what just works.  Do yourself a favor and buy this book. If you love weight training you will love this Bigger Leaner Stronger.
0547884591|4.0|A bit overwhelming at first, but take the time to read the first chapters. I picked this up not to learn to cook but to learn a new way of learning anything. Still challenged on how to apply the methodology to other areas but it is a quantum leap in a whole different direction, and shifting my paradigms will take some time and practice.

B000B5OD4I|5.0|Overall, this is a really nice watch.  It doesn't quite have the panache of vintage Seiko 6105 and 6309 cushion-cased dive watches, but it has a considerable following in the dive watch community, and is a favorite for customizing.  Numerous bands, dials, hands, and bezels are available so you can make your watch uniquely your own.  Also, you can wear this watch while you search for your vintage Seiko, if you're so inclined.  The only problems I found were that the lugs for the watch band showed visible tool marks, and the holes for the spring bars were a little crude, not the precisely drilled holes of my Tag-Heuer or vintage Seiko.<br />  On the plus side, while Seiko kinetic dive watches are not generally known for their accuracy, I must have gotten a good one.  My watch lost only 27 seconds over the first 10 days of use.  Having apparently settled in, it lost only an additional 6 seconds over the next 10 days.  While not quartz-level accuracy, this is outstanding for a mechanical watch and truly exceptional for a Seiko automatic dive watch.<br />  The metal Jubilee bracelet, while not great, is not as bad as many people seem to think.  The outer 2 and center links are solid metal, while the remaining 2 inner links and end pieces are formed sheet metal.  It's functional, very flexible, and comfortable.  If you feel like replacing it you can, but it's not an absolute necessity.<br />  My only real complaint is regarding the warranty.  If your order is fulfilled by Amazon, your watch will not be covered by the Seiko warranty because Amazon is not an authorized Seiko dealer.  Amazon will remove the warranty information, warranty registration card, list of authorized Seiko repair shops, and watch instructions from the watch box because, according to Amazon, they are \\"void.\\"  Why Amazon considers the Seiko instruction manual to be void because the Seiko warranty doesn't apply is not clear to me.  The generic instructions Amazon supplies with the watch are neither accurate nor complete.  However, the appropriate instruction manual may be downloaded from the Seiko website.<br />  Instead, Amazon offers its own 2-year limited warranty covering only the watch movement.  According to the express terms of the warranty, it does not cover problems with the bezel, crown, crystal, band, or case.  In other word, there are many, many things which could go wrong with your watch which would not be covered.  I'm not sure whether or not the dial and hands would be considered part of the watch movement, and therefore covered.  I haven't had any problems with my watch yet and haven't attempted to use the warranty.  It may turn out to be outstanding. However, my repeated attempts to register my watch online for the Amazon warranty were unsuccessful, and my e-mails to Amazon requesting assistance remain unanswered, so I'm not optimistic.rate nor complete.

B009GYSQV6|3.0|I've never heard so much side chain compression applied to a recording. I understand it's a fad, but when the fad is over, it'll still be there, so people will say, \\"Oh yea...this was made way back in the day when people were going nuts with side chain compression.\\"

That is what Christmas decorating is for- family togetherness.

B0090P0O70|3.0|It was hard for me to follow in the beginning....almost decided NOT to continue reading it.... With that in mind, I have just started to become an avid reader approx. 6 months ago.  I have heard so many people talk about reading books and loving it.... well now I read, and I think I am trying to make up for lost time.  Anyways, I continued to read this particular novel because it was one of those books that seem to be a MUST read by book lovers.  The story line was not what I expected from the numerous old black and white HORROR flicks I watched as a kid....So with that in mind, I was in shocked in  how the story was progressing. This is one of those classic cases where the BOOK and the MOVIE(S) are very far from one another.  I always felt sad for the MONSTER in the movies, but even more so from the book.  I also had some issues with the writing style and verbage.....but I do not have a BIG volcabulary by any means....Thank gawd for KINDLE, that way I could easier click on the unknown word (to me) and figure out what it meant.  In the end, Im glad I read it.

It changed me and the way I look at and live my life.n so I am willing to look in on, and probably participate in almost any romp he cares to host.  This book did push the envelope for me.  There was some discomfort as I grew.  But worth it.  Tim is definitely a renaissance man, and his interests and topics range far and wide.  But he never loses focus of what he has set out to teach us.  Thanks Tim. Great job.  I am going to circle back around and order The 4 Hour Body now!  All the best to you.
0345536886|4.0|John Grisham is a best-selling machine in contemporary literarure. He is to legal drama what Tom Clancy is to military intrigue and what Ludlum was to the espionage thriller and what J.K. Rowling is to YA fantasy. And, as it turns out, Grisham could write funny things. THE LITIGATORS introduces a cast of characters so disreputable even Deck Shifflet crosses the street when they approach.<br /><br />One of Grisham's recurring themes surfaces, the one with the idealistic lawyer going toe-to-toe with a giant corporation. THE LITIGATORS tracks the misadventures of Finley & Figg, a two-man \\"boutique\\" law firm nestled in one of Chicago's low-rent districts. Oscar Finley is the crusty senior partner (he hates his wife). Wally Figg is the rotund junior partner (and a recovering alcoholic). Both are ham-and-eggers who rely on relentless ambulance chasing for their bread and butter. Neither had ever tried a case in court. They prefer to settle. Not everyone can be Perry Mason or Atticus Finch. Wally Figg, the more ambitious of the two, dreams of seeing his mug planted on bus stop billboards and in television adverts.<br /><br />Business is rough, cases are few and rarely lucrative. The last thing the firm and its shady operators needed was to hire young Harvard Law graduate David Zinc. David had, earlier today, suffered a nervous breakdown, quit his fast-track career at a prestigious law firm, and had gone on a drinking binge. David Zinc desperately requires a change of pace. He mourns the past five years he'd wasted as a nameless cog in a vast machinery. And he, too, had never tried a case in court. Finley and Figg take him in, anyway. At this stage, you could drop a Three Stooges reference and it wouldn't be inappropriate.<br /><br />I mentioned that Wally Figg is the ambitious one? He's always had a jones for the easy buck, for castles in the air. His latest scheme involves jumping in bed with all them other lawyers gearing up in a mass tort case against Varrick Labs, a Big Pharma company responsible for producing a drug called Krayoxx which reduces cholesterol but also may be inducing heart attacks. Wally is salivating, with an eye towards a sure thing, the easiest class action suit ever. He drags a reluctant Oscar and David along. He signs up clients who have either taken Krayoxx or had lost someone who'd taken Krayoxx. He files his motions. And then the \\"boutique\\" law firm of Finley & Figg sits back and waits for this pharmaceutical giant to crumble and pay up. A cocky Wally even signs notes promising his clients millions of settlement money.<br /><br />So, yeah, overnight, the Finley & Figg law firm became specialists in mass tort litigation. But they should've brushed up on their Perry Mason and their Atticus Finch.<br /><br />For whatever reason I hadn't picked up a Grisham novel in years. THE LITIGATORS returns me to the fold, even if it's not as suspenseful or electric or, frankly, as ambitious as, say, THE FIRM or THE RUNAWAY JURY. It's a lightweight read, but I couldn't stop reading. It's a sly, tongue-in-cheek expos&eacute; on the seedier elements of lawyering. I like the lead character. David Zinc makes for a likable protagonist, likable because of his inexperience and his idealism and his resolve (although, okay, in some ways, he's too passive). He somehow reminds me of Mitch McDeere and Rudy Baylor. David's presence serves as a grounding element whereas Finley & Figg tend to come across as caricatures who endlessly bicker and unscrupulously practice law. However, Finley & Figg, with their bottom-feeder escapades, also provide chuckles.g Pharma company responsible for producing a drug called Krayoxx which reduces cholesterol but also may be inducing heart attacks.

Thought Lupton's take really clever and enjoyed it much more than anticpated. Would recommend as an easy read, thought provoking and satisfying.

B008K8VDPU|5.0|I had a different piano app that was okay but not great. I was hoping to find one with more than one octave. I found this one and gave it a try. Super fun and easy to play familiar songs because of the guided playing help. I'm not very good, but my instant addiction to the app will certainly help improve my skills. :)
B009GX7IRA|5.0|We love watching NCIS.  Our main reason for being hooked on the show is the wonderful characters.  After watching them for season after season we feel like we know them.  ( When out shopping a few weeks ago we saw some scull patterned pajama bottoms and I started to tell my husband &#34;we should get these for Abby.&#34;) We love how the characters have developed over the years and love how they interact with each other.  This is the only television program that we watch and hope it goes on for many more years.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Another winner from one of the most consistent writers on the market.  It grabs you early and keeps you up at night reading!!  I have read every book of this series, and enjoyed every single one!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Love it. It is very addictive. My husband and I challenge each other! Great past time since the kids are grown.
B00AFROVQC|5.0|I absolutely LOVED this book: Face paced, full of twists and turns, adventure packed, a little bit of intrigue.  I especially liked the way Morgan 'teaches' young Thor through Erec and Argon.  Great read - can't wait to see what happens next.
B0030Y11XS|5.0|I watched a documentary called &#34;Inside Job.&#34;  This peaked my interest in the financial matters that have been kept from the average American.  So when I saw this on cable, I had to have my own copy.  In fact, I bought four additional copies to give to friends I felt would be interested.  This DVD is eye opening and I recommend it for anyone wanting to be informed.
B007HACDLK|5.0|This book is everything that you would expect from Vince Flynn and more!  For those who have been following Mitch Rapp, there is nothing negative to say about the story.  The editing could be better - there are numerous typos - but the story is absolutely captivating!  I couldn't put it down!
B005NS0VNU|5.0|A nice way to say goodbye to your fans. I enjoyed their pick of songs to leave us with. Solong
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I hope this series goes on forever. Love the characters and the imagination.  Interesting description on historic character roles  especially regarding women.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|As always this game is fun.  My grandchildren all love to play it..  I started it on my phone and I must say it is addictive but very disappointing that to add to the collection you have to pay.
0525952926|5.0|Love Ken Follett's books....good research and great stories interwoven into history. All of his novels are thought provoking and he always adds touches of compassion and humor.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|As usual John Grisham kept me on the edge with a surprise twist in the end.  I would read more books like this if the price was more reasonable.  At least with a book I can hold in my hand I have something to keep that justifies the price.
0385535147|5.0|Always enjoy Grisham's novels. The first novel I read was one of his first and I was hooked from then on.
B0086700CM|4.0|I cannot in all honesty rate this item  I have never played it.  My grandson loves it though.  I allowed him to add it after hearing from other people that it is fun and addicting.
B003CI90MQ|5.0|Have these books in paperback and now have them on the Kindle. Much easier to carry around with you and you can always pull it up no matter where you are.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|The beginning and middle of this book were vintage Grisham.  However the last part of the book was a bit if a stretch. . You are left with a good reading experience with a somewhat flawed ending.  i still recommend that you buy  the book  and enjoy the ride..
B009VSW15Y|3.0|I cannot really rate this app properly because the camera on my Kindle Fire HD is faced for using Skype and I am not a Skype user.  I agree with the other reviews that Amazon should have included a camera app with the tablet, and it should have been made clear that it is for use with Skype, not as a camera.  So this app probably is adequate, I am just not able to use it effectively with my Kindle's camera.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|I purchased this for my 11 year old granddaughter for her birthday.  She read all the books, saw the movies and wanted this for home.  Came on time, in good condition.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|This is a great app.  I would have given it five stars except that it doesn't remember what my favorite settings are.  I like to wake in the morning, look at my location with a combination of satellite and radar and it always starts at the beginning with my choosing the location.  It goes directly to a list of conditions and I need to request Maps, then Satellite and Radar.  And if I want motion, it takes a while to build the animation.  That may be the speed of my internet whidh is basic DSL.  So I wait and it builds and then it's pretty cool!
B009LUCPWQ|4.0|Worth buying if your a true fan.  Still &#34;Sparks&#34; is their best offering in my opinion.  Look forward to see them in Boston this week!
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Hooked on Plum Is., the Lions Gate, UpCountry, who woudl have thought DeMille could outdo his wry sense of humor in the John Corey character.  I laughed through the whole book, yet feel so much more informed on geography of Yemen and the work of insurgents.
B005LAIHQS|5.0|Even though this movie is pg-13 there is just gross things. You can bring all of your kids there and it will not scare a hair on then!!!!!!!
B007SGLZP8|4.0|John has done a great job once again, developing the main character.  He's cleverly kept the reader guessing who-dun-it since the reader is led to sympathize with the villain at one point.
0547884591|5.0|I enjoyed reading the book so much I had my husband download the kindle version too so that I could have someone to talk to about all the great info in the book. I can't wait to get to the end so that I can go back and start putting some of it into practice.There is so much information I like to read the book one time through, and then go back and pick out some of the things that I want to start using. Great read. Love Tim Ferris and all of the 4 hour books!!!
B0053O89U6|4.0|Modern Family has come to be synonymous with high praise and award show dominance.  Season three proves that the hyperbole surrounding this hit-show are not chimerical and are, if anything, not strong enough.  The wonderful cast, led by Ed O'Neil, always finds a way to be utterly believable to the point that it's easy to think of the characters as actual people, not invented personalities for the sake of entertainment. Eric Stonestreet, who portrays Cameron, is especially noteworthy for his flawless performance in each episode. The writing, though, is what really makes the show outstanding.  A combination of touching, witty, and smart humour pervades each episode often pairing comedic antics with meaningful asides about family, the parent/child dynamic, etc.  The pairing of intelligent scripts and phenomenal acting easily makes Modern Family a show worth watching but also a show worth owning for viewing when new episodes aren't airing.  This is show is a classic in the making and may ultimately join the pantheon of iconic television shows against which all others are compared.
B000UZNRS2|5.0|All of this series is great. Oliver Stone is one of my favorite characters that David Baldacci writes about. The other members of the Camel Club make it very interesting and fun to read about.
B0009UC810|5.0|I think that john Belushi and Dan Aykroyd were one of the best in comedy back in the day, and I still like watching these movies. this movie is a must see.
B000FCKIFU|5.0|The beginning of the Camel Club saga. It introduces the characters and rolls they play in the series. Well worth reading. Fun and action packed. Oliver Stone is hero of the story. Down to earth but larger than life. Love it.
0547884591|5.0|This book is fantastic. I was super impressed just getting it in my hands and more impressed upon opening it. Loves the inside cover page photos and captions. This book has amazing content, is amazingly designed, great photography throughout and has kept me interested and ready for more unlike any other book for some time.<br /><br />Bravo and thank you Tim!
B00127RAJY|4.0|Pleased with this purchase.  I have not been able to workout with it for the 30 days, but the little time I have tried it has been great!
B001VNB54A|5.0|Loved Band of Brothers and I cant wait to watch this series!  Shipped promptly, and arrived earlier than expected. Karate.
0547884591|5.0|When we thought that Tim couldn't top his two other books, he comes out with the ultimate guide to learning fast and hacking life. Although I don't give a sh*t about cooking, it's the best book I've read this year!
B003JBI2KM|4.0|Very fun and interested to read. Papazian is either liked or disliked, almost no middle ground. I found the book fun to read, and definitely learned a thing or ten. If you're new to homebrewing, or just like to know a bit more about beer, its well worth the read.
B00A0HQ7H8|5.0|This is an album that has grown on me.  Rhapsody kept suggesting I give it a listen given my choice of music, but her melancholy throwback voice and style only got me through just the beginning of a couple songs.  Then while creating a play-list I threw in a couple of her songs at random and began doing a project I had that didn't require too much of my attention.  Anyway, half way through one of her songs, Gods and Monsters, I thought, \\"damn, she swears a lot\\", but it peaked my curiosity and I paid a little more attention.  I ended up listening to that song, maybe four times in a row and by the fourth time loved it.  So, in new light, I gave the album a listen and the rest is history.  I now listen to both her albums on a regular basis.  I had never heard anything quite this flavor before so maybe that's why it took a bit.  Highly recommended.
1936608898|3.0|I've read the Wolf, Cordain and Sisson books, as well as one by Gedgaudas which I found just as good, although the hard core Paleo folks don't seem to accept her as much as guys like Mark Sisson and Wolf, who promote themselves much more. Nothing new to learn in this book if you've read the others. Wolf's is more scientific than Sisson. Sisson seems to stress more vegetables than meat, but is definitely a Primal book. Reading this one was almost like a mix of the previously two mentioned authors works. Not much new to learn, outside of some recipes. Although once you understand the lifestyle and food preparation in a Paleo/Primal way, cooking is pretty simple.
0547884591|4.0|I am probably the queen of self-help books. Once I get my claws into something there is no letting go, unless I smell a rat!  Well Timothy Ferris you are the real deal and I can not stop singing your praise. There is no letting go of your information and I crave more. I have just finished The Four Hour Chef and have in practice the Four Hour Body. You do your homework and prove your theories. If Dr. Oz is behind you not to mention all the other professionals you have worked with over the years we should at least give it a go. . AND what you put you body through to share the outcome with Us! Well BARNES & NOBLES is missing out!!!!! I would buy your book if I had to search the globe to get.  Well done!
B006AX6ONI|4.0|He comes off like a blowhard, and he probably still is, but he definitely busted his butt to get where he is today. Considering what I paid for this as a Kindle download, it was well worth the money. The moral of his story: If you want it, you can get it. If he can do it, you can do it, But, you've got to want it more than everyone else. And if you're going to live your life, live your own life. Working for yourself is awesome, but its not easy.
B00006CXSS|5.0|Direct quotes and short interviews with actual soldiers depicted in this film. War is never a grand thing...yet this film seems to capture the light hearted, the extreme psycological and the dsimaying moments...of a period of time not so long ago.
B008IJTFYW|4.0|I saw this randomly and downloaded it simply because it was free.  Turns out, I like it!  I used it for the first time last night and fell asleep within 20 or so minutes.  And it was a restless night before that. haha
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|My kids, husband and I all enjoyed watching this movie. We have seen it multiple times now! The kids (ages 7 and 4) ask to watch it constantly
B005LAJ1H2|5.0|Packaging and layout is what I expect from HBO. Awesome. Arrived ahead of schedule. My grandfather and I watch Boardwalk together and it's become something of a traditional XMAS gift from me to him.
B000MV9026|5.0|This is a gift for my sister who lost her copy of it and she has part 2 of Happy Feet.
B00A7ZXDLQ|5.0|Rihanna did it once again...<br />So glad I decided to ge this cd... I haven't stopped listening to it yet
B000Y7U98C|4.0|I brought this movie for a friend who first saw the trailer on a movie that I have in my collection.
B0043VDIAG|3.0|It's a good book and story. But it's to slow for me. I think you have to read a lot before you get in to the book
B0010358CQ|5.0|I love anime movies and I have the first one and this finished off the set that whats advertised on this site.
0061969656|5.0|I highly recommend this book to all anglophiles, and to anyone interested in how the english-speaking people came to be.
B009O07NMA|5.0|I saw Florida Georgia Line on December 1st in Des Monies while they were touring with Jake Owen and Love and Theft. Florida Georgia Line is absolutely amazing live! They played new songs from this album and had autographed CD's available to purchase at the concert. A-MA-ZING!!! If you love their song Cruise, you'll feel the same way for this entire CD! I recommend buying it!
B008XG1X18|5.0|This is so addictive.  I love to create boards and \\"like\\" things and add them to a board later.  I can keep all my ideas in one place and it saves me money on subscribing to magazines!
0715338153|4.0|Even when Im not working directly from the Tilda books I always use them for inspiration. The only thing i dont like about the book set is that you have to enlarge all the patterns on a copy machine. But the characters are so cute, and I have actually traced some of the patterns as is in the books and used them to make little felt aplique items, so the small size patterns do have a use as they are. I love the inspiration of the color blends and prints in these beautifully photographed books and Ive blended things from one pattern with things from another pattern. Ideas skip about in my head till out comes something new and unusual. The birds are so graceful, and the chickens in bloomers are a total hoot. Ive kept myself busy since I got my first book and my Grand daughter will be finding lots of Tilda in her christmas packages this year.
B000AL730O|4.0|The quality of McCartney's solo work has been uneven since the release of Band On The Run but starting with Flaming Pie he seemed to have suddenly experienced a new burst of inspiration and creativity.  This excellent work is the great album that all of his fans have been patiently waiting for all these years.  To me it's his finest solo work and proof that he is still one of our greatest songwriters as well as a great singer and musician.
B009GEAPYW|1.0|Was in a rush, did not relize this movie was ANIMATED , when I did  after a minite or 2 stoped it, but was to late ... Had to pay
0547884591|5.0|After 4 Hour Body I was hooked on his writing and 4 Hour Chef didn't disappoint. Mr Ferriss has an unorthodox way of learning and getting through life. He also is a good enough writer to bring you along with him so you understand his mindset. The 4 Hour Chef is a winner that I'll be referencing often for cooking techniques and lots of other stuff.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Just got mine in the mail. It does indeed come with UltraViolet copies of all 3 movies!<br /><br />It also comes with:<br />A 64 page excerpt from \\"The Art and Making of The Dark Knight Trilogy.\\"<br /><br />Batman Begins: 1 disc (Movie and special features together)<br />The Dark Knight: 2 discs (Movie and special features are separate)<br />The Dark Knight Rises: 2 discs (Movie and special features are separate)<br /><br />And a code for discounted memorabilia.<br /><br />Hope this helps!
0810989956|5.0|this is a Christmas present for my grandson and he  wrote down exactly that this is what he wants.  He is 10 years old and loves to keep a journal.  He will love this book !
B009WO7NQO|5.0|This is by far my favorite in the series. All of the well known Star Wars characters make their appearance as well as having unique new abilities.
B000GTJT0M|4.0|I really like this movie, I think that it kind of peters out towards the end but visually it is a stunner.
0812993292|2.0|This book starts out on a wonderful premise, but the author seems to lose their way about 1/2 through and doesn't finish well.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|This is a required second film to the consumers of commercial foods. It shows how the seed companies are being given unacceptable leeway in taking over farming without due diligence to prevent the unwanted spread of their poison. Further, it indicates that seeds will not germinate until (in the future) a Monsanto developed chemical is sprayed to unlock the germination mechanism.

B004OT2WKO|5.0|My Review for people new to Technic building...<br /><br />THE GREAT<br /><br />01: As with other Lego Technic kits, the mechanical design of the Unimog is a thing of beauty. Watching the progress develop from a seemingly disconnected collection of complex mechanical components into a full, working truck (with arm) is really profound fun. Well, if your a geek like me. Also, the fact that this model is of the UNIMOG, which is the most unsexy hunk of truck on this earth, makes it even more attractive. The \\"utility\\" of this model shines though, especially when watching all the working pistons and gears moving.<br /><br />02. The instructions, while at times a tad obscure, are also a thing of wonder. Imagine being a drafter and being told to demonstrate how to build a multi differential, wildly complex machine WITHOUT USING WORDS. I say ANY company, who demands that their customers build their products, should take a long hard look at how Lego solves these problems with well rendered graphics.<br /><br />03: Sturdy! It doesn't fall to bits when rolling it around.  While I wouldn't let my 5 year old at it..this thing can take some abuse. But really, this model should be sitting on a \\"shelf of pride\\". It's not meant for sand box thrashing. But that's just me.<br /><br />04: Forgiving! I adore that Lego let's you make mistakes. They design for your ineptitude! How rare is that? For once I'm not being subjected to engineers that think I'm as smart as they are!<br /><br />UMMM...NOT SO GREAT<br /><br />01. Really Lego? I was missing THREE pieces? Any Lego builder knows that sinking feeling when your build comes to a stuttering stop because Lego didn't include every part. Yes, they have a great ordering section for missing parts. Yes, they have a great customer service, and I expect this happens allot. But this still is very un-fun. I hope Lego looks into this issue seriously, as I'm seeing this compliant more and more.<br /><br />ONLY TIPS THAT MATTER.<br /><br />01: Separate every part (per numbered bags) into bins! Organize!! You purchased this thing to BUILD it, not to play some mind numbing hide n seek game with parts that look alike. Do the work of organizing and you will have improved the build experience by 90%. I let my 5 year old organize all the colors and parts, and she loved it!<br /><br />02: Slow down! The build is the fun part!! Take your time and really follow those directions. Unbuilding, because you miscounted holes five steps ago, is really not so much fun.<br /><br />FINAL<br /><br />The UNIMOG is an excellent example of just how far Lego have come, and really shows off some tremendous engineering/design talents. I maintain this is more than a toy, but a work of industrial design. I really loved the process of building the UNIMOG, I think more than any Lego set, and while I was very disappointed with the discovery of some missing pieces, I'm still more than satisfied. This set will delight those of you who love watching the under workings of complex mechanical systems and is an educational experience by default.<br /><br />Lego really nailed this one.<br /><br />Now I have to justify the $400 bucks for Technic Off-Road.....Gulp. Heck, you only live once!
B001TUPKAA|4.0|I liked it. I like Jim Carrey in movies with a story line. This is one of those not great but entertaining. I enjoy  just relaxing and watching a good romantic  comedy. This movie was more comedy than romance.<br />I say Yes to the Yes Man and I will watch it again just to see if I missed something.
0385344333|1.0|I have read all of Lee Child's books and have really enjoyed them.  However - \\"The Wanted Man\\" completely disappointed me.  I felt like 90% of the book was just basically descriptive writing that really didn't deal with the plot of the story.  I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone!
0547884591|5.0|Ferriss has knocked it out of the park again! Whether you want to learn how to cook,speak a different language,or take up a new hobby/skill, Tim will give you a prescription for success!
0547884591|5.0|This is my second book from Tim and I must say it is my favorite so far. I did enjoy the Four Hour Body but found it difficult to read from cover to cover, though I do realize that is not his intention with that book. That being said I have been able to plow through this book with ease. I'm only part of the way through the Wild section and I can't wait to finish more. There are some really great tips in here and it leaves a lot of room for improvisation in the kitchen.<br /><br />Can't wait to read more. Thanks for putting all the research in and sharing all of this with us.
B006G4F8OW|5.0|I would recommend this product to collectors, the box is very finely printed on and it straight new.<br /><br />Great buy.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I hate having to wait each week to find out what is going to happen next.  This one ranks right up there with Deadwood and Dexter.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I choose this rating cause I watched season 1 and I had to see season 2 . Amazon got it to me fast. I plan to purchase all the Downton Abbey seasons.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I chose to read this book as a love story, not a hot sex novel. Of course there are steamy parts but to look at the entire story as a whole, it is a sweet love story.
0062213423|5.0|My daughter loved this book, told her everything she ever wanted to know about one direction! I would recommend this to anyone who's kids are in &#34;love&#34; with 1D.
B007THA4FI|4.0|I think I liked this novel better than most folks because I have been reading through Dickens for the past year or so. While Rawlings writing style is nothing like Dickens (which is all to the good), the structure and topic reminded me of Dickens. Like many of his novels, this one starts out introducing a bunch of seemingly disparate charcaters and then slowly brings them together into a loose narrative with a healthy dose of social meaning.<br /><br /> Having been immersed in Dickens, I adjusted my expectations very quickly once I saw the similarities and was pleased with the novel. Had I come in with &#34;Harry Potter&#34; expectations I doubt I would have been so pleased.

0547884591|5.0|It would be this book!  It is not only educational and entertaining, it encourages thinking outside of the box.  I can almost feel new brain synapse' being developed and hear long forgotten neurons waking while I dance through new experiences and thought patterns along with Tim. I highly recommend you put aside your preconceived notions of a cook book, buckle your seatbelts and just enjoy the ride!<br /><br />I am a massage therapist and last week I treated a college student who was home to recuperate following an accident.  We chatted a bit while I worked and I learned of her passion to discover life her own way.  She left with \\"The 4-Hour Work Week by Tim Ferriss\\" written on the back of one of my business cards.  Oh, to be 20 years old and know of Tim and his books!

0345803493|1.0|Soft porn..  Most of the action took place in the bedroom or the playroom.. or some other location were the act was performed.  It was all about sex.  No story, or very little excitement unless you like to read about make-up sex over and over again. Not worth the money spent. Whenever I got tired of a bedroom scene, I fast forwarded the kindle and sure enough, the next action took place in the bedroom, or was it the playroom...  The locations changed but the rest was all the same.  Redundant...  Doesn't matter if you read page 15 or 55 or 255, it's always about fighting, make up sex, fighting again and making up again... 0 value book
B002N5N5M0|5.0|Alosha Lowery<br />December 4,2012<br />  Dexter<br />Dexter is a blood splatter expert who works for Miami Metro police department. During the night Dexter takes on the role of a serial killer. Dexter is different from other serial killers because he kills people who have done something wrong. Dexter wants to make Miami a safe place to live in so he eliminates the people who are disrupting the peace. In each season of Dexter there is a different killer that Dexter tries to hunt down. Dexter stands out from all the other TV shows because the character plays such conflicting roles.<br /><br />The acting in Dexter is what makes the show so great. Michael C. Hall does a great job playing the role of Dexter. It amazes me how in the TV show Six Feet Under he plays the role of a gay guy and in Dexter he takes on the role of a serial killer. Playing the role of a gay guy in one TV show, and then a serial killer in another are two-way different types personalities Michael takes on. Dexter's sister Deb is played by Jennifer Carpenter. When I first watched the show I had no idea that they were married in real life. They apparently broke up in 2010 and finalized their divorce in December of 2011. In Dexter they are very close to each other and they do a great job of putting their relationship struggles aside and making the show the best it can be. To me it would seem hard for two people, who had split up to be able to do such a good acting job when around one another, Their performances are what make Dexter so good.<br /><br />One of the things that really make me like Dexter is that it is very interesting and I always want to see what happens next. There is rarely ever a boring episode and I never can only watch one episode without wanting to watch another. Since I like crime scene movies and tv shows, Dexter is perfect for me. I am taking forensics in high school because I find it very interesting. When I go to college I might major in criminal justice because I like to solve crimes. Dexter's unique ways of solving cases is mind blowing. Your always left wondering what he will do next. There really isn't anything I dislike about Dexter. Dexter is one of my favorite tv shows of all time. There haven't been any bad episodes after 6 seasons. The only thing I can possibly think of is it sometimes takes a while to get down to the main point.<br /><br />In each season Dexter has to hunt down a different serial killer. My favorite season out of the six so far is the fourth season. This season is by far the best season because Dexter tries to hunt down a serial killer. The serial killer is a guy named Arthur Mitchell. Arthur Mitchell has a unique name the \\"trinity killer\\" because he always murders three people in a very specific sequence. Mitchell first starts with a young woman in a bathtub, then he focuses on an older mother of two falling to her death, and finally he ends with a father of two bludgeoned to death. Later on in the season Dexter finds out that Trinity's pattern begins with the abduction and murder of a ten-year-old boy. Dexter realizes with this information that Trinity's pattern consists of four victims instead of three. The season is full of surprises and shocking moments. If you want to know what happens in the end then you are going to have to watch it yourself.<br /><br />Dexter can be compared to tv shows like CSI, Law and Order, CSI Miami, CSI New York, NCIS, and more. Dexter can compare to these tv shows because they all deal with crime scene investigation and mystery. All these shows are about finding out who is responsible for the killing of a victim. The one thing that makes Dexter different and better is that in Dexter there is a character that takes on the role of a forensic analyst and a serial killer. None of the other shows that I listed have this unique twist to it and this is what makes Dexter stand out.<br /><br />I would recommend Dexter to those who like crime scene tv shows. Dexter is all about crime scenes being solved and it is one of the best crime scene tv shows of all time in my opinion. Dexter can get graphic at times so beware before watching. Peter actually recommended this show to me and at first I was like it probably isn't that good, but when I sat down to watch it I was just amazed by the quality of the tv show. Even if you don't like crime scene tv shows I would still recommend that you watch it because you might end up actually liking it. I would give Dexter a 9.5 out of 10 for the amazing acting and just the overall quality of the show.
B0071BGOJC|5.0|It´s a magnificently developed story occurring in a terrible moment of history. This expected second book of the trilogy makes honor to the first one.<br />It is a very entertaining tale, difficult to put down, while is, why not, instructive about the powers moving behind the war.

THE US PENAL SYSTEM IS A VERY HAPPHAZARD BUSINESS AND A GIANT TRAP WITH MORE THAN 2 MIO. PEOPLE IMPRISONED. THE FIGURES ARE ABOUT 80 PER 100 000 PEOPLE IN EUROPE ARE IMPRISONED AND IN THE US IT IS 10 TIMES THAT - ABOUT 850 PERSONS PER 100 000. PEROSNS.<br />IT IS NOT A SYSTEM ANY EUROPEAN WOULD WANT ANY CONTACT WITH.

0143034901|5.0|We read this book for book club and I thought it was beautifully written.  Sometimes I felt bogged down in the details but on the other hand, the details were part of the reason I liked it so much.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I can't wait for the next book to come out in May. I thought it was worth the read....especially if you like romance.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Like most Harlequin books, you know the ending before you read the first page. They will live happily ever after eventually.<br /><br />This particular story involves a couple who get married while drunk in Vegas. He wants a family without ties, she wants someone to create a baby. He just broke up with his fiance two weeks before. She is also coming off of a relationship. He is rich, which makes everything easy, and while she doesn't remember the wedding, she agrees to a 3-month trial.<br /><br />(Spoiler - if you have never read a Harlequin book)<br /><br />Of course, while they have decided NOT to be intimate, there is lots of kissing and groping.<br />Of course, they fall in love.<br />Of course, eventually they DO get intimate (in graphic detail) - but it's OK, they ARE married<br />Of course, things get complicated and they part.<br />Of course, they get back together.<br /><br />During their discussions they act responsibly about STDs and their impact in today's world.<br /><br />Both of them act childish and manipulative in some ways, but caring in others, and at a certain point, they do discuss their backgrounds that have made them act this way. I tend to like more in-depth books, where things like this (instead of the groping) are the focus, but since it is included, I have to put this above some of the romance novels out there.

B008G12ERC|3.0|I don't think this album is as good as Muse's previous endeavors, but it grows on you. The lyrics and music are a bit too obvious and cartoony, like a poorly attempted rock opera. Still, I love Muse!

B000002VSN|5.0|I love these songs and being that Whitney is gone, i thought i'd buy it.  I was actually watching this movie when it was announced that she had passed away.  Which makes having this cd a must.

B000O8OTNC|5.0|Great tool for your money, really impressed with it's performance,<br />I go trought many scharpeners during the year, I own some gerber knifes<br />and since they are made of very hard steel they have the tendency of wearing out<br />the sharpeners, This little guy works great with just about any steel providing a very good long lasting edge.

B005LAIHZY|5.0|I'm only giving this 5 stars because I got it on Black Friday for 9 bucks. For that price and Prime shipping, it's beast. I haven't seen it because it is a gift to my niece that loves it, but for that reason I'm giving it 5 stars.
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|Fun drama filled with personalities and the adventures in a mans life.  Wittingly paramount and helpful in facing death to those afraid of dying.  Suitable for children.
B0036TGT3E|5.0|As one of the biggest fans of Lion King I kind of expected more features, but it had a decent amount. Overall the quality is amazing and the story is still as good as it ever was. I'm glad they didn't include the Morning Report when watching it but it's still there as a feature somehow. But what can I say, if you haven't watched this movie yet, you absolutely must. It's for people of all ages. It has it all, action, adventure, romance, comedy, very good songs. It is truly an Epic.
0547884591|5.0|I have purchased thousands of items from Amazon and this is the first that has prompted me to feel a desire to create a review. The 4 Hour Chef melds portions of Tim's other works, The 4 Hour Work Week and The 4 Hour Body into an artistically stunning adventure into the basic human need to prepare and consume food. This is might not be the best cookbook on the market but it is by far the best all around nourishment book for the mind, body, and soul.<br /><br />I have purchased 5 copies of this book to give as gifts.<br /><br />Thanks Tim!

B008XX6J4C|5.0|New Review: I bought this a about 9 months ago, and I didn't like it at first. I put in on the shelf and never looked at it again. Then they were coming to concert and so I I took the time to get reacquainted with the Piano Guys. I delighted to find out how wrong I was in my first assessment. As a classical musician, I was very impressed with their fusion of modern with classical creating a neo-fusion which I'm loving! If at first you don't like it, research where the songs came from, and do some digging. It wasn't until I was thoroughly familiar with Beethoven's 5th Symphony that I really appreciated Beethoven's 5 secrets. And until I understood what Michael meets Mozart was all about it didn't ring for me. But now that I understand, I really like this album! I just saw them in concert, and now I'm looking forward to more music from The Piano Guys.<br /><br />Old Review: I was expecting a masterpiece with this album. Unfortunately I was sorely disappointed. If you have heard all the songs, and you like it, then order it. I pre-ordered it, and was very sad when I listened to it. (Added) I was asked what made it so-so for me. I wasn't expecting instrumental pop music. John Schmidt is a great pianist, but his music is very modern, and has many fans. I was new to his music, and liked some of his medleys so i went out on a limb and bought this. Instead of finding music like Bach, or Chopin i just got some new age piano remixes of songs that I already know/am not fond of. I'm not saying this is a bad album, it just isn't my style. If you like new age piano, and other John Schmidt songs buy it! It's a great album, if you like that. I LOVE Bring Him Home with John Schmidt and Steven Sharp Nelson, but these were just pop style songs played on a different instrument. I felt like they were looking to have fun and play music, and that's what this album feels like.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Can't put it down!  Can't wait to finally see the movies now that I have read the book!<br /><br />OH and also Love reading it on my Kindle!
B005WUHAX8|1.0|You can't use a charging dock with case. Also it has built in bubbles in the screen. Should have returned it because I won't use it.
B0099G6Q5E|4.0|The songs were too short and they had been edited to remove monologue. Short movie soundtrack but well worth it cause I got it half off.

Ive never like zombies or vampires movies or anything but ever since The Walking Dead ive been hooked on it.. i cant seem to get enough of it. I love the fact that you can really get attached to each of the characters, every single one of them has a very important role, Rick, Shane, Lori, Dale, Glenn, Andrea, Etc... Love it!

B00338QENI|4.0|Although I found it somewhat wordy, that, I considered minor compared to the amount of information that was given. Rebecca did a fine job of combining a human interest story along with extensive background data on the science of her research. A very good read for anyone who is interested in how many of our modern medicines evolved and past research came into fruition.
B007SSEBCU|3.0|Meryl Streep's performance is almost worth watching this movie on it's own but the script's portrayal of Margret Thatcher was very week I suggest getting a good book if you are looking for any serious representation of the Iron Lady.
B001UU75WK|1.0|I rented this movie expecting it to be \\" scary \\" by the previews and the sound effects. I wasted money and time watching it. Just when you thought something good was about to happen it just ended up sucking .. and the ending is the worst ..people dont waste your time or money if your looking for a \\"scary\\" movie cause this is not it.!
B00AA7O22U|4.0|I can really think of only one word that best describes this movie &#34;EXPLOSIONS!!!!!!!!!!!!&#34;<br />It does have some good comedy to it but if you don't like explosions this is no your movie.
B005LAIH54|5.0|I am a big fan of Greek mythology and Clash of the Titans (both versions). I watched this and liked it better than the first. It was original and entertaining. I will admit, however, I love action movies and it does not take much to make me happy.
0143122061|2.0|This was an interesting analysis but I couldn't get past the offensive discussion of race in America. When describing how race relations have changed in the U.S., Ferguson states, \\"a whole time-honored complex of words and thoughts can no longer publicly be uttered\\". And that's when I shut the book. I don't think I've ever heard a respected, preeminent historian refer to racial prejudice as \\"time-honored\\". What a disgrace. Don't read this book of you are looking for an enlightened, tolerant opinion.

B000KKPN5C|5.0|I have the larger Nikon SB-700 flash for my Nikon D7000 but wanted something a bit smaller for daily, casual photos. I love this flash and often use it instead of the SB-700. Really happy with it.
B0036EBARO|5.0|Great beat, Allison Goldfrapp and band has done it again!!! It rocks and edgy dance beat.<br />Hardly wait for next album. My 20. Year old son who is mentally challenged connects<br />With the beat and dances and moves his body to the rythem. Its amazing.
B005IZLPKQ|5.0|I love action hero movies and this one was really good. I have watched it several times and really think it is filmed well. I am not a fan, and never have been, or comic books, so I have no idea how true it is to the original story line.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This book was amazing. I was constantly on the edge of my seat wondering what would happen next. Even after seeing the movie first, everything was a surprise to me and I felt like I had been thrown into the Games with each of the tributes. Don't pass up on this amazing read!
B003Y5H5EW|5.0|I am a huge fan of the Underworld movies and this one is no different. Then again, it does have Kate Beckinsale, so you can even watch it without sound :-)
B006LSZECO|2.0|I don't typically write reviews, but after spending $13 for this book I had to. I really did not like the portrayal of the main characters and I didn't care for the twist. Very unbelievable...
B0034G4P80|4.0|This movie is quite corny and at times even stupid but I really like action hero movies. If you are a casual fan of such movies this one you might want to pass on.
1451627297|5.0|With this book Stephen King impressed me and not only because I already was a great fan of his books before (even if I absolutely do not agree with his politics). \\"11.22.63\\" is one of the best, most intelligent and most profound time travel stories ever.<br /><br />As it is pretty obvious by just looking at the cover, the story turns around the assasination of John F. Kennedy and an attempt by a person from our times to prevent it. The man who finds the opportunity to travel back in time and try to save Kennedy's life is an altruist idealist, who hopes that he can change the history and as a result make our world a better place. He can not go directly to 1963 - he can only travel to 1958 and so has to live five years in the past before he can act. He knows that the risks are very high, because the past has ways to protect itself from the changes - and the more important the change is, the more lethal defenses are used... But still, he goes for it.<br /><br />The description of time traveller's life in the 50s is excellent. King took great care to study the details of all days life in this time and I really felt like I was in this time and place with the main character. I was also delighted to learn, that even if Stephen King is a very left-winged writer, his sexual fantasies are very conservative, in fact they seem similar to those of deeply catholic Sicilian peasants from the beginning of XX century...))) (remembering Mario Puzo's \\"Godfather\\" can help to understand the last sentence).<br /><br />The tension rises in this book all the time, surprises are well preserved and twists are served at just the right time. There is also a long and excellent sequence reminding the last chapters from \\"The day of the Jackal\\". Supernatural elements are very few as they are used to spice all the thing without drowning it in mumbo jumbo. But those things are pretty normal for King's books, which are almost always excellent - and therefore they are not the reason why I was so impressed by \\"11.22.63\\".<br /><br />I was impressed by this book for two reasons. First, Stephen King decided in his description of events in Dallas on 22 November 1963 to go against the opinion of a majority of US citizens (including his own wife, as he recognizes it in the - very interesting - postface). This disply of common sense and intelligence took some courage.<br /><br />The second reason was the conception of the time and of the mechanisms by which it defends itself against changes and of ways in which it can be changed, and of their various consequences. I can not go here into many details because I absolutely do not want to provide spoilers, but I was surprised and very impressed by the final chapters of this book. Considering once more how much left to the center King situates himself, writing the last chapters of this book asked for a LOT of courage. Also, settling the old argument between Leibniz and Voltaire in the way this book does, required a kind of wisdom rarely seen amongst self-declared \\"progressists\\".<br /><br />Bottom line, this is not only an excellent read but also one of the best, most powerful and most profoundly wise books by this very talented author, who with this novel just reached a whole new level of greatness. Enjoy!ssed by \\"11.22.63\\".<br /><br />I was impressed by this book for two reasons.

0547884591|5.0|This book is chock full of shortcuts, quick tips, and 'cheats' for every day life, as well as amazing learning strategies.  It's the perfect companion book to 4-Hour Body, and is so much deeper than being a cookbook (although I understand the use of cooking to demonstrate learning any skill).<br /><br />I struggle to find anything negative to report, but if I had to come up with something, I would say that this book is more like several small books than one and is not meant to be read cover to cover (hardly a criticism since Tim explains that upfront).  I also found myself mentally drifting back into 4-Hour Work Week and 4-Hour Body quite a bit while reading, but since I loved all three books it was a pleasant experience.<br /><br />My advice to anyone who wants to learn something new, start a business, get in shape, or improve their own life in any way - pick up the 4-Hour 3 pack of books and happy reading!<br /><br />Shane

B001SKB1Y0|5.0|Not only did we enjoy this movie immensely, because it plunges you right into the lives of the characters and engages you emotionally and intellectually, but we continued to debate what the movie &#34;meant&#34; for hours afterwards.
B007SGLZP8|1.0|I was so disappointed!  I expected to love this book because John Grisham's books are consistently good.  His disclaimer at he the end said it all.  The author admitted that he wrote this book on the fly without any research.  This was apparent throughout and I felt a disconnect from the plot from the get-go.  What was most upsetting was that he would choose to use this technique when he had an ethnic protagonist.  It was like authenticity didn't matter.  The story line was so confusing and convoluted that I ended up skimming over the last part of the book to get to the unsatisfying conclusion.  Hated it!
B009KHCRVO|3.0|worth the time! there are some very funny moments, the race humor is uncomfortably edgy, and the premise alone makes it amusing.
0547884591|5.0|The nicest thing about this book is the way the recipes are organized, especially in the main \\"Domestic\\" chapter. Whereas most cookbooks will divide recipes into \\"appetizers,\\" \\"poultry,\\" \\"dessert,\\" etc., Tim Ferriss divides his by increasing order of complexity. The first few lessons are super-easy and almost foolproof, and he builds on what you've already learned as you move forward. In the later chapters, things can get kind of complex, but the Domestic chapter is all about getting you to be comfortable cooking without too much stress.<br /><br />If I could make one change, it would be to note some of the adaptions that could be used. Ferriss talks a lot about grapeseed oil as his go-to oil, whereas many people probably have olive oil or canola oil sitting around in their pantries. It would be nice to know if these could work instead. Ditto for a stainless steel or non-stick pot, when he often recommends a combination cast iron dutch oven/skillet. Still, despite these few hang-ups, I consider this one of the best \\"learning to cook\\" books I've seen so far.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|My kids and I have been having a lot of fun playing this app. I don't like the idea of having to purchase additional paint colors & bombs, but that's what meeting all the challenges is for. We'll just have to save up our coins because I have far more important things to spend money on and have an extremely tight budget. Other than that, the ads don't pose as too much of a problem so it makes the free version tolerable.

B00006CXSS|5.0|Band of Brothers is a 10-part account of the wartime experience of Easy Company, in the 506th Regiment of the 101st Airborne Division.  It begins with their training experience in Georgia and follows them to England, to D-Day in Normandy, Operation Market Garden in Holland, the siege of Bastogne and, eventually, the capturing of Hitler's Eagle Nest headquarters/estate in Bavaria.<br /><br />Featuring Damian Lewis, Ron Livingston, David Schwimmer, Donnie Wahlberg, et al. the miniseries (based on Stephen Ambrose's book) features the individual experiences of individual characters in separate episodes and contains opening commentary by the characters' real-life counterparts.  A sixth disc, containing material on the making of the miniseries, etc. features more interviews with the actual, surviving members of Easy Company.<br /><br />Under the leadership of Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg, the miniseries contains a great deal of realistic footage of the sort seen in Saving Private Ryan.  Limbs are severed and the sounds of bullets and shrapnel whizzing through the air are omnipresent.  We feel the cold of Bastogne, luxuriate in the beauties of Austria and suffer through the training regimens to which the company is subjected.  Watching is not always easy or pleasant, but the emotional impact of the separate episodes is strong.<br /><br />The individual episodes are quite uneven.  Some are extremely powerful, e.g., the training episode and the D-Day episode (with stunning use of CGI).  Others are less satisfactory.  The Bastogne episode, for example, is a long, cold sojourn in foxholes with German artillery and mortar fire shattering trees and shattering bodies.  Civilians, however, will obtain a realistic sense of the actual nature of war.<br /><br />The production is courageous in representing the courage of some individuals, the incompetence of others, given the fact that the `characters' represent real people.  Given the fact that the narrative is historically accurate, our `wishes' as viewers sometimes go unsatisfied.  We want to see much more of Damian Lewis in the role of Dick Winters, for example, but the fact is that Dick Winters was promoted to a battalion position and could not be there, leading Easy Company, for the duration of the miniseries.<br /><br />In general, this is a superb miniseries and the subsidiary material on the sixth disc is excellent.  The actual, historical members of Easy Company speak for themselves with great but simple eloquence and their eyes tell a story of war that brings the reality home in ways that films can never quite do.e, our `wishes' as viewers sometimes go unsatisfied.

B002NZTZ8S|4.0|Once I was able to get a good internet connection, the movie played in excellent quality.  The movie itself is also quite enjoyable; it captures the mood of the original story very well.
B008V0OLOW|3.0|All right, so I'm using hyperbole for effect. This is clearly Diana Krall. But the style? Well honey, this vibe just doesn't fit you nearly as well as that Victoria Secret stuff you're wearing on the cover.<br /><br />On the plus side, this is a welcome change from Quiet Nights, her bossa nova experiment where Diana sounded not just relaxed. More like sleepwalking, most of the time. On Glad Rag Doll, Diana sounds wide awake, but out of place. She just doesn't do honky tonk, barrel house, or country-flavored tunes that well.<br /><br />The piano is subdued on most tracks, which is a disappointment because I believe piano playing is Diana's greatest asset. And I can recall instances of a cheap, tinny-sounding piano where her normal full grand piano would have been more welcome. At the end of the Deluxe edition, there are three quiet tracks where Diana sings and plays a better-sounding instrument, and these tracks might be the highlight of the album.<br /><br />The guitar sound is for the most part rather unpleasant. A ragged, raspy steely sound on some tracks, and a growling distorted electric guitar sound on others. Guitar seems to be more dominant than piano on this record, leaving Diana's singing as the main focus. This she performs competently, but she either does not have the voice or the sensibility to carry these songs off. The delivery is polite when it needs to be raunchy, in order to fit with the song and the rest of the instrumentation. That's my take on it at least. And I don't think Diana can pull off raunchy.<br /><br />On some level I appreciate and commend Krall on the urge to try out a different genre and a different sort of sound, a different sort of band. But the fact is that some artists are more versatile than others. Norah Jones for example sounds at home singing mock punk rock, country and western, blues, or straight jazz. Still, there are songs on this album Diana Krall could successfully add to her repertoire. Glad Rag Doll is the title trackfor a reason. It's one of the best performances here. All in all, I can only get into about a third of the songs on the Deluxe edition. A lot less on the standard release.<br /><br />For my money, if I was looking for an album of Diana doing something a little different, I would go for Paul McCartney's Kisses On The Bottom, where Diana is the main keyboard player in the backing band. She really shines there. I think she truly holds that album together.<br /><br />Next time I think we could hope for more of Krall's standard jazz piano playing, and something closer to the Great American Songbook. Diana, if you want to mix things up, then try adding a sax and a cornet to your band, not these raspy cheap-sounding guitars. Or vibraharp. Vibraharp would suit you nicely.

0547884591|5.0|Just like the 4-Hour Workweek and the 4-Hour Body, Tim's newest book is just plain awesome. Follow his advice, and you can learn how to do ANYTHING - including cooking - in the shortest amount of time possible. And what could be cooler than that?
B00008CMR6|5.0|Top of the line, good dialogue; a classic Wayne movie. It's not quite El Dorado or Rio Bravo, but it's a good enough to hole the interest and to fulfill that yern for the old west.<br />AGP
B00A2IUHM6|5.0|Ted is not a childrens movie. It may be about a cute teddy bear but its not for kids. Ted is rude crude and has a attitude makes a great date movie. I give it two big thumbs up.

B009K45Y62|2.0|I pre-ordered this a few days before it went OOS, so I felt lucky. Well, I had no luck when it arrived today. It was missing the movie on blu-ray. I ended up with 2 Special Edition discs and 1 dvd disc! Of course there are none in stock and didn't want to wait till Amazon got them back in stock (if ever), so I had to send back for a refund and wait 2 more days for the standard edition to arrive.
B000YMM3CC|5.0|It's destined to be a classic.  Grab your tissues and ponder the thought of til death do us part.  THIS is what love on earth is all about.
B0083GQKQG|1.0|THIS MOVIE WAS DISJOINTED AND HARD TO FOLLOW.  I WATCHED ABOUT 1 HOUR AND HAD TO SHUT IT OFF.  BORING, TOO HARD TO FOLLOW, NOT ENTERTAINING.  I DIDN'T GET THE GIST OF THE TALE AT ALL.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|Who could hate a Harry Potter movie.  Lots of action, great acting.  I like that the movies follow the books and hated to see the series end.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|This is the most beautifully written book I have ever read.  That being said, it is not for everyone.  This book weighs in at nearly 1,500 pages and as such can be a bear to read.  Hugo describes every facet of this story in such excruciating detail that it is almost painful, but in my opinion, this makes it better. How many times have you read a book, fallen in love with the characters, and finished the last page feeling a sense of loss and wanting to know more? Every page sends you deeper into the story and it inspires you to be a better person.  When I finally finished it, I was almost floored. The profundity of what you read leaves you in thought for a few days.  After journeying with the characters and beautiful speech for 1,500 pages, you almost don't want it to end.
B007EE564U|5.0|Another 'page turner' from Vince Flynn. Would love to see Mitch Rapp series filmed with the proviso that  a certain short  Hollywood 'star ' does NOT manage  to talk his way into the leading role:)
B007FEFLTO|4.0|Fall of Giants was excellent. This is really good but not as good as fall of giants. It does follow the same characters and brings alive the build up to WWII. Good read and looking forward to the third in this trilogy.
B007REV4YI|5.0|I have seen this film twice already (a rarity for me) and I can happily say that it is one of those rare occasions that surpassed my expectations.<br /><br />Casino Royale was a great way to reboot the franchise. Quantum Of Solace was \\"fine\\". It wasn't a bad film...but it lacked the Bond derring do we all know and love. Skyfall brings the last 50 years of Eon films full circle in a very heartfelt manner. It's touching at times, but not overwrought with pathos. The opening titles are my favorite in the entire series (although the award for best Bond theme still goes to Shirley Bassey's Goldfinger). Sam Mendes has shot a visually stunning film (probably the most artistically stunning of the entire series in terms of cinematography). Javier Bardem gives us a villian that could easily take his place among the most disturbing villains in cinematic history including the likes of Heath Ledger's Joker and Ted Levine's brilliant Buffalo Bill/Jame Gumb from Silence Of The Lambs. It was as if Bardem was actually channeling the two to create Silva and he owns every single scene that he inhabits throughout the film.<br /><br />Daniel Craig is a great Bond and I look forward to future adventures now that we have the back story in place. Bring on the \\"kiss kiss, bang bang\\"!!!!!

B007IXWL2C|3.0|The underlying story is what kept me going through this series.  The sex got boring after a while, and it was written very poorly.  Publishers: Please edit books before you publish them, even if they are fanfiction.
1470056496|5.0|A psychologically-intricate exploration of the power of sexual attraction. Fanny Price has barely enough integrity to keep her attraction to cousin Edmund under wraps; Edmund, meanwhile, is so utterly transformed by his desire for Miss Crawford that he pretty much pimps Fanny out to Miss Crawford's licentious brother.<br /><br />Austen's bleakest work, Mansfield Park is a meditation on both the demonic power of sexual desire, and the fragility of any morality that simultaneously celebrates physical beauty AND tries to regulate the bewitching effects that beauty has upon all of us.<br /><br />And if you're paying attention, you won't be fooled by the all's-right-with-the-world, David Lynch-like ending, either. Indeed, the center does not hold...

0446547573|5.0|I have seen a lot of the movies created from Sparks books but this was the first I've actually read and I couldn't put it down.  I love the ending!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I use Evernote for everything.  Notes to myself, things to remember clipped from websites, gifts for Christmas and birthdays, you name it. I especially like using it for recipes I find on cooking websites.  Then all I have to do is bring it up on my Kindle Fire to refer to when I'm cooking. I've used other apps like Springboard, but I prefer Evernote. I like the fact I can keep everything synced on all my devices, and have it available on the PC too. Great free app!
B008M721MS|4.0|When I was looking at the one star reviews, people would complain about it not working on their Kindle Fire.  If they were using the original Kindle Fire, of course it wouldn't work!  There's no camera!  Also, try setting up an account on your computer first, it'll come in handy!  It works great for me, great video quality, great sound, only thing is you can't launch group conversations on it.
B00AE2I4B6|5.0|It has incredible choreography, great music, the cast was very good.  The movie looked and felt inspiring and very high energy.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|Thank you Disney Pixar for providing the world with a strong female lead that DOESN'T need a prince to rescue her.  She's a princess I am proud to have my daughter emulate.
B0012NVGHU|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies.  The story is so simple, yet original.  The music is so soulful and is really another character in the film.  A must see.
B005BW0VI8|3.0|I bought this after listening to Ms. May on Woodsongs, hosted by Michael Jonathan (?sp).  I expected a bit more from this album.  Having said that, it is still enjoyable & I do recommend it.
B0088WK27S|4.0|I really liked how the story showed the hero's flaws as well as his strengths.  Gerard Butler did a great job in the title role.
B0075VGCPO|5.0|I recently lost my copy of Silent Hill and was having severe withdrawals from the movie! So, of course I had to buy it again!!! This is my favorite movie of all time!
B003YOWU1Q|5.0|I got to see Ray and the Pariah Dogs in concert last year, and they are just wonderful musicians.  So soulful and a great retro sound.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I love this series and I'm so glad that it's now available as an Amazon deal!  I always wait around and rarely do my favorites show up, so I'm glad to pick this one up for me.
B009369Z8A|4.0|I won't paraphrase the storyline as others have done here so well.  I will add that the moment<br />I hit play on the BD Player, I was so engrosed in the film I realized I was still sitting<br />on the edge of my seat after the first 20 minutes before I made myself comfortable, and never once hit pause.<br /><br />I was riveted by Tom Hardy's acting, his portrayal was an original. It did not rely on a particular accent, clothing, make-up, mental defect or resemblance to a historical figure. He created an intelligent backwoods bootlegger, who despite his profession and its violence, lived by a code so strong that he appeared invincible. The glimpses of his tenderness he allowed himself were profoundly felt.  The film was satisfying in its cinematography, cast, and story.
B0079R8IYW|3.0|I like the cover, but I don't love it. I got it because of the pockets but if you put even one card in one slot it makes the cover too bulky and doesn't close right. A redesign needs to be conducted.
B008B68IEA|5.0|My 6 year old daughter is helping me with this review. &#34;Abbey loves her bed, and her pet loves his cozy bed. Abbey likes to be cold, so a bed made from ice keeps her cold. Even her tv is ice, I wish mine was like that too. Her blanket looks like her dress. She even gets a ice lamp and ice clock so she isn't late for school. My Abbey sleeps better with a real bed. Could you please make a bed for Cleo and Ghoulia now?&#34;<br /><br />I think she says it better than I would of. Great product, Sturdy. Wish the pieces stayed on permanently though, I know shes going to lose a few pieces.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Fun arcade style app....a bit slow with coin regen though. It is a fun app to waste time or waiting at a store
0062020897|5.0|From first page to last, Follett has more twists and turns that switchbacks on a mountain. I felt like I was on the sidelines watching the story unfold. I bought his Pillars of the Earth hoping it would be similar but it is way too many pages for my patience. This one was just enough to keep me hooked.
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|Good tunes.  Catchy melody with creative edge that makes listen to this folk-ish music a blast.  A must buy for your collection
B004VMUS9G|4.0|This is actually a very good alarm clock with a lot of settings and options. Works great! The only thing that could make it better is if the &quot;clock&quot; icon for the app was a working timepiece
B005LAIHR2|5.0|If you like 80's rock you'll like this movie.  It's a good movie with an awesome sound track with some classic 80's rock hits.
B000H4QD1O|3.0|I missed Firefly when it first aired so I've been playing catch up.<br />Here's what works about Firefly:<br /><br />The character development and stories are well done. It's rare to have that much depth in a series that was so quickly cancelled. The special effects are outstanding even for today's market.<br /><br />Here's where Firefly failed:<br /><br />The whole \\"western\\" theme never really makes sense and it gets old. Hearing old west slang mixed with futuristic terms just doesn't work. Add to that irritation is the addition of Chinese phrases and curses which is \\"downright\\" annoying.<br /><br />I know I'm in the minority but the Kaylee and River characters are by far the weakest. It's not just the characters it's the actresses themselves....just not very good.<br /><br />If you love Science Fiction and missed out on Firefly, give it a shot. It's far better than most the junk television networks spew. But it's far from perfect and doesn't come close to the high ratings and praise most reviewers here have given it.
B000W74EQC|5.0|Love this movie!  It's a great film and I was glad to get it on DVD since I only had it on VHS.
B007BT0RKG|1.0|I have a very fast Wi-fi connection and this app took almost 20 minutes to load (along with the CA map). I downloaded Need for Speed MW faster than MapsWithMe.<br />The premise is great. Just a regular road map without GPS or need to be online on a tablet. But after this horrendous download, I find that the free version doesn't include the search function. That makes this app completely useless. Don't waste your time!
B007PKSN6Q|5.0|This is the best soundtrack ever.  The cast sings some of the best loved hits ofd the 80's and sometimes sing them better.  Tom Cruises rendition of Paradise City is far better then the original.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|it is a great game ,I have been playing this for awhile and it is even better on the kimdle
B007V508CC|5.0|This is a good CD for Maroon 5 fans.  It is probably more like Hands All Over then any of there other ablums.  I especially like &#34;One More Night&#34;,  and &#34;Doin' Dirt&#34;.  There are a couple of songs at the end I'm not to fond of, but over all its a good CD
0345803485|5.0|Not something I would have chosen to read myself BUT~.Different strokes for different folks~~ after the first book;you understand alot more. If you want to learn alternative life'choices' then I would definitely read the Trilogy & give as gifts for other adult members as presents.
B000W746GK|5.0|I order this movie on a Black Friday sale for an excellent price.  I was glad to find it since the only copy I have is on VhS
B00A2H9NZY|5.0|I saw this movie several times.  I had no idea that there were waves that high off the California coast at times.  To see it on the big screen made one realized the courage of these men that dared to surf them. Fantastic!!!<br />It's a great movie and it tells the story of real persons. The height and the incredible force of the ocean is beautiful if you're not in it. It was a great story and the actors were very real in their portrayals. (And yes I'm going to buy the DVD's and give some to my family.
B00005JKZV|5.0|I like this movie a lot and was happy to get it on DVD.  I am looking forward to watching it.
B001992NUQ|5.0|Awhile back a friend showed me the book, I'm glad he did. Defiantely not a movie for younger viewers. This will be a movie keep.
B0058YPL66|5.0|I love this show!  I have watched it through twice and some of my favorite episodes even more.  I enjoyed the bonuses like to commentaries, which provide an interesting look it the story and the filming of the show.  A very enjoyable show with increidible acting and storyline.  My favorite character is Rumplestilskin/ Mr. Gold.
B007EECSFA|5.0|Kate Morton has the ability to keep you turning the pages. I didn't want the book to end.<br />Her writing style is easy but thought-provoking, not trite.<br />She weaves a compelling story without resorting to cheap sexual or violent episodes.<br />Perhaps the last few pages were a bit weak. Never the less, I wouid definitely recommend this book!
B00005JMFQ|5.0|And now is the time to watch it.  It grows on you.  This is a movie you'll watch whenever it is on tv...regardless of owning the DVD.
0061474355|5.0|Sabriel is enchanting. Though I read it several years ago, and have devoured many books since, Sabriel has endured one of my favorite novels of all time<br />Mr. Nix creates a irresistible world so vivid that you can see the flicker of charter marks, hear the unearthly chiming of the Bells, and feel the chill of Death. The details are original and flawless, the magic system intriguing,the plot compelling and well-paced and the haunting imagery perfectly matched to the dreamlike yet utterly plausible world of the Old Kingdom. Perhaps the most original aspect of the world of Sabriel is Mr. Nix's treatment of death as a world, and almost a character in itself, and the key role it plays in the world and the plot.<br /><br />It is however, not the world, but the characters, that give Sabriel much of its power. Sabriel herself is an enthralling and dynamic heroine: a young woman on the verge of adulthood, trying to come to terms with her past and her role in the world even as she races to save it from evil. Beyond Sabriel herself, the supporting characters are equally mesmerizing: Touchstone is an enigma, and Mogget the cat (or is he?) is wonderully morally ambiguous.<br /><br />All in all, Sabriel is a well written, original, and enthralling novel that well deserves to be read and reread!

0316228532|4.0|The Casual Vacancy is at first glance a slow paced political drama. However as you continue reading the characters become more interesting, and very real. With no true heroes or villains. (Ok maybe one or two 'Villains') there is something in any of the main characters that the reader can relate to. The more you read the less important the political aspects of the story become to the reader and the characters.<br /><br />Although at first I had difficulty remaining interested in the book, by the end I was sorry the story was over. Ultimately it lives up to the writing I have come to expect from a JK Rowling book, even if they are completely different stories. I look forward to the next JK book regardless as to the type.
B0017XD3OY|5.0|good flick. totally. would own it. cool. I dont' want to type anymore. please. why do they force you to writ

B007SGM084|5.0|Great series. The books just kept you wanting to read them and not put them down. I can not wait until the movie comes out.
0307730697|1.0|If you are looking for an exciting war story, skip ahead to the single chapter that starts on page 214.  If you are looking for a book on what family life is like for a navy seal, then this book is for you.  I think the title is a bit misleading because when you see it is about a Navy Seal operator, you expect to hear about the exciting part of the action.  I just flipped open the book and here is the first sentence I read, \\"Two weeks after Savannah was born, the Brown family returned to Virginia Beach, renting a house with a yard in a suburban neighborhood.\\"  If that is the riveting type of reading you are looking for..then read Fearless.<br /><br />Thank you to all involved in the military for their service.

0143113100|4.0|In the narrative by Norman Doidge the reader is given a small glimpse into the vast world of neuroscience. Doidge argues against the older idea's about the brain and how it works in favor of brain plasticity. Using an interesting blend of personal experiences, emotional stories, and scientific research to help show the reader his idea's in a plasticity.<br /><br />Though interesting and well written Doidge uses a lot of scientific terms that everyday people have trouble understanding, so it's best to keep a dictionary handy. There is also the problem of the animal abuse in testing that Doidge uses as examples. From sewing kittens eyes shut and lobotomy on live monkey's, to chopping off monkey's fingers the stories may be a turn off to some animal lovers. Yet Doidge is insistent that open minded monkey's and bind kittens are the root of some of the studies done to prove his point. By the end of the book Doidge sounds like a broken record constantly repeating himself and stressing his thesis. This books is great if you're studying or interested in neuroscience and parts of psychology but it is also tedious which requires effort to finish in one sitting.
B005LAIIQC|3.0|I like my spy movies to flow from one good scene to another, with a clear plot and a lot of action. There are exceptions when someone else really does an impressive variation on this, but The Bourne Legacy falls flat.
B004ZY0VHY|4.0|This book is an amazing read....it's like a car crash that's so horrible you don't want to look at it, but yet you can't keep yourself from peeking.  Very well written, but equally disturbing.  I found myself only able to read it in small doses and then thinking about it constantly... the characters have a way of working on you long after you finish the book

B005UBNKZG|5.0|This chip, to start off, was a huge upgrade from my last being a sluggish dual core. All of my programs are faster, start-up is faster, and gaming is very smooth. For example, a recent game I have bench-marked, had the 8120 working hard and bottle-necking because the game used only four cores.  So I overclocked it to 4.0ghz with stock cooling and it ran smooth as butter. It had held the record at 8.429ghz for quite some time, and still does. Its multitasking ability is exceptional, the eight cores allow for great gaming on the newest titles and superior video editing. It wont be long before 8 core processors become the standard of how many cores a program can recognize.<br /><br />  Idle temps with good cable management and fan setup gave me 8c idle and a max of 50c. The highest recommended temp is 60c constant for the cpu, and a peak of 70c, in which you should find a solution. The stock cooler works fine compared to many others, that is if you have strong case ventilation. i do have to point out that AMD released this processor to be purpose built for easy and extreme overclocking.<br /><br />  As a side note, if users are looking for even faster load times for no cost, and if you have sufficient RAM, AMD has also released RamDisk which stores any program files or personal files of your choice onto the RAM for instant access, all of which works great with this CPU.
B0079XNWQA|5.0|Jason Mraz has a style that is fun and inviting.  Loved this cd and it made a great gift selection too.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Good story and I enjoy Grisham novels.  The characters are people you care about and like but this novel lacks the suspense of other novels he has written .  There is never one of those moments where you can't sit the book down because you are afraid what will happen to the characters like exist in The Firm, The Client, A TIme to Kill and some of his other books.  Still if you are a Grisham fan you will enjoy the read.

B005K17RU0|4.0|I use this app to help me plan my wardrobe for the week. Also, I use it to schedule short- and long-distance driving travel plans.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|I liked the beginning of this book but I would have liked more details that were not provided and would have made it a more interesting read, in my opinion. So much of it seemed vague to me. I'm sorry to say that I lost interest in the story when the hero turned into a jerk and just skimmed to the end of the book. Also, this couple could use some intense therapy to work through some deep issues that could get in the way of a HEA. I would recommend this book only if you didn't have something better to read. Sorry.
B009KHBDUU|4.0|Some subtleties you have to look for in the movie but they're classic Burton.  I enjoyed the movie and recommend it.
B002M9WW30|5.0|Im so excited to be able to have a rainy day movie thon with all the Rocky's. Great movies at a great price!
B006S8QY8K|5.0|Susan and Richard really do pair up well in flicks and this was no different. Lopez's charater relationship made it interesting.<br /><br />Ballroom dancing is an art form, and it is nice to see Gere get into something other than kissing someone he not supposed to be smooching with.<br /><br />Overall, the film is well done -- the characters fit their roles well, there are some surprizes along the way to keep it interesting, and in general the acting is believable.<br /><br />Two thumbs up from me!

B0064TVQ5E|2.0|DOWNLOADED AND DELETED IT!  GUESS I'LL TRY IT AGAIN.  PEOPLE HAVE SINCE TOLD ME THEY ARE 'HUNG UP' ON PLAYING THE GAME.  I GUESS I WILL GIVE IT ANOTHER TRY.  DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THE PRINCIPLE OF THE GAME THE FIRST TIME.

B009AZZEU2|5.0|As a fan of the whole Seattle scene of the late 80s to 90s, having Soundgarden back is something I've been waiting for. This album don't disappoint one bit. Every listen just gets better and better. Everything I have ever loved about them is here, just like they never left. It's actually a waste of time to go through and review each song seeing how the entire album flows so perfectly together. Buy it. Enjoy.
B0086700CM|4.0|My friends introduced me to this game, and I've been hooked ever since. I haven't really decided though if I like it better on the iPhone or the Kindle Fire. I think the larger screen is better, but sometimes I'll disagree, too.
1451620829|5.0|Peter Criss starts off the book stating that he'll tell everything, warts and all, and I believe he did. He shines the light on his own problems and hard luck he's endured in his life, as well as telling it like it was to be in KISS and deal with Simmons & Stanleys mega personalities. I have read Simmons and Frehleys autobiographies and can say that I finally got the full exposure that I was looking for on the REAL Kisstory. I can't recommend this book highly enough. While you might not like the ugly truth that you're reading sometimes, you can't help but appreciate the honesty that you're getting from Criss.
B007TXN4TK|2.0|I was looking for Smule, actually. This was the closest I could find. Yet, it's nothing like it at all. I'll stick to the app on the iPad and iPhone.

B005IQZB14|3.0|Parts of this book drug on. Not a complete waste of time to read just not that great. The book was slow in parts.
B001VNB54A|5.0|I bought this series for my father for his Birthday and it was something both he and I watched together. We both really liked it and I also love that Amazon shipped it the same day.
B0036BK6MW|5.0|One of the best movies I have seen in a long time.  Sandra Bullock was wonderful and the story was very moving.  Would recdommend it to anyone.
B009FB3XTA|5.0|This CD will give me memories of the movie for a long time to come. The music is beautiful and I find myself listening to it and enjoying it while I'm doing other things. This would be an excellent gift for  yourself or another &#34;Twihard&#34; you might know. One of the best music collections of any of the Twilight movies.
0547884591|5.0|Really great book filled with a ton of practical information that you WILL use in day to day life. GREAT read and will be buying for friends and family.
B004XZR63M|5.0|This book has timeless advice that's easy to understand and apply to your current financial situation. I would recommend this book to anyone from ages 12 and up.
B006LSZECO|1.0|Liked the book until the last page.  The ending was so horrible it made me hate the book and regret spending the time to read it.
B009X01C64|4.0|Agree with all the other reviews, definitely high quality construction and materials.  Works great, and should protect my Fire HD well.  Rotation feature allows for just about any conceivable orientation you'll need.  Feels a bit bulky, but not too bad.  Overall I'd say 4.5 stars.<br /><br />Note, add this case plus the 8.9\\" Fire HD, and the total weighs in at 33oz.
B0026P3G12|5.0|Susan's voice is a national treasure.  The song choices are rich and flavorful with just enough texture to make them interesting.  No, I'm not talking about coffee, I'm talking about this beautiful album.  Buy it.  You won't be sorry.
B009E3EY38|1.0|Truly should have been captured and produced at the highest quality. Instead the audio quality is poor (on both the CDs and the Blur-ay) and the video .  I don't think the fault was with Zep, They rock and seem to be enjoying themselves. But who produced this and why did they do such a lousy job?  See for comparison No Quarter (which is still not available in Blu-ray) but captures the band well and sounds terrific.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|beautiful. graphics are great. works good on kf.I would highly recommend this game to everyone. the map helps &amp; make sure you get all artifacts!!
B000I62JAK|5.0|this movie serves a purpose - to make you laugh, and it totally succeeds at this. my wife and i laughed non-stop the first time we watched it.  so, on those occasions when we just need a good laugh, we go to Zoolander.  it's just as funny the third or fourth time you watch it, too.<br /><br />movie snobs, critics and haters abound, but just ignore them and enjoy the movie.
0061726834|5.0|Initial Impressions<br /><br />I was looking for something to read after The Hunger Games that was thought-provoking and inspired discussions among readers because of varying opinions of the subject matter. When I read the synopsis for this book, I knew I wanted to give it a shot.<br /><br />The Summary<br /><br />Lena Holoway has had a life filled with pain and is looking forward to the day when it will be taken away for good...the day of her procedure. The procedure will rid her of the amor deliria nervosa and will leave her future safe, happy, and healthy. When her best friend Hana starts behaving strangely, it throws Lena off balance and she answers all the questions that she knows the right answer to in the wrong way during her evaluation. Afterwards, Lena's life takes a turn that is decidedly different than the one she imagined.<br /><br />The Good<br /><br />The whole concept for this book is something new and wonderful and had me constantly asking myself how I would act in the same situation. Love as something evil, a disease to be eradicated, seems like it would be hard to make believable, but Lauren Oliver does the job. You truly follow the rational thinking of the characters and how they come to their conclusions. The main character, who often calls herself 'in-between', is an every girl who becomes the book's heroine through choices and actions. Conflict and hope in equal measure make for an excellent reading experience.<br /><br />The Bad<br /><br />The only drawback was that the beginning was a little slow, but you know that it's to provide you with necessary information to hook you into the story. Although slow, I found the background information extremely relevant and interesting.<br /><br />The Romance<br /><br />This is a YA series, but there are situations implied. Even though this is a story about love being a disease, there are circumstances of love presenting itself. The love of a mother for her child, the love of a cousin for their cousin, the love of best friends, and other examples are found in the book.  Every type of love mentioned in these pages is like finding a treasure.<br /><br />Conclusion<br /><br />I immensely enjoyed reading this book, and by the end immediately wanted to dive into the next one. I am already hooked and will be reading the 2nd in the series, Pandemonium.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to YA readers that like Science Fiction and Dystopia.love of best friends, and other examples are found in the book.

B008Z9L94O|5.0|Mellon Collie & the Infinite Sadness was the most significant and influential record for me growing up as a wayward youth.  To this day, it is still my favorite.  I actually purchased a new record player purely for the reason of buying this MCIS reissue.  The quality of the recording is outstanding, and I absolutely vouch for this as the best record of all time.<br /><br />First thing that is on everyone's mind, the order of songs is that of the CD, not the original 1995 UK vinyl.  In a way, this disappoints me as I was hoping to hear it in the new order.  Infinte Sadness and Tonite (Reprise) are not included.<br /><br />This slipcase is absolutely gorgeous!  The artwork featured on the case is the artwork shown in the product thumbnail.  The surface is a nice gloss, with the art itself being raised slightly to give it a texture.  It is very well made, and each record has it's own sleeve.  On one side of the sleeve is a pattern of the MCIS dingbats and song listing, the other side has a large version of some of the original MCIS booklet artwork.  Newly packaged, each vinyl comes packed in a lined paper sleeve.  Additionally packaged are smaller sleeves within the sleeves, all of which have a monotone pattern akin to the original MCIS artwork.  The assumption is you can remove the paper sleeves and house them in the rigid cardboard sleeves that have the artwork.  (See image)<br /><br />There are two books that accompany the music.  One is basically a large version of the MCIS lyric sheet from the CD version.  However, it is in a different typeface.  A minor change.  The woodcut artwork remains the same.  The second booklet is an all new booklet that features a small recent article written by David Wild in which Billy talks about MCIS and the significance it had on him and the band, and where it lies as far as the \\"best time\\" in the history of Smashing Pumpkins.  Also in this booklet are notes by Billy on each song and how it evolved, the meaning, what he thinks of it, which is incredible insight much of which has not been revealed until now!  Amazing content!  Though it seems as if the booklety was designed fore the CD version, as the songs are divided between the classic \\"Dawn to Dusk\\" and \\"Twilight to Starlight\\"  There are also concept sketches for much of the MCIS artwork, done by Billy.  Much of this eventually evolved into the John Craig collages that MCIS is well known for.  The only thing that drives me crazy about this book is that they include some stills from some of the music videos (usually in the columns) but they are shown letterboxed (black bars on each side) WHY would the person doing the layout let this happen?  I understand that the change to widescreen changes the aspect ratio, but black bars could have very easily been removed and would make the appearance of these stills more appealing.  However.  Good news guys, there's a blown up version of the band with D'arcy holding the carrot!<br /><br />This is definitely a collectors item.  MCIS being my favorite, I had to have it.  And it is absolutely worth it.<br /><br />Edit: To address the issue of the sound quality, it was not until I played it back and listened closely that I noticed some \\"sonic artifacts\\" in parts of the recording, namely Zero (certainly not audible \\"all the way through\\").  Hardly a distraction while listening to, and goes largely unnoticed.  I listened to these records in their entirety and I feel as though the recording is of a good quality.  It sounds the way vinyl should sound.  I dunno how much different you'll find the CD version to be, but you might as well just download an mp3 or a FLAC if you're going for \\"digital flawlessness\\", which is incredible insight much of which has not been revealed until now!

B0098VYCCE|5.0|Great family movie.  It was like watching the other side of Snow White, the witches side.  I wasn't interested in it when it was in theaters but I'm glad I gave it a shot.
B0036TGT3E|5.0|The sound in this remaster is amazing, the picture quality is literally pristine. It looks like it was made this year, but of course with the incredible animation and attention to detail of the golden age of Disney. If you like Lion King and have a nice display and speakers, you must own this Blu ray.
B009KHDT0C|4.0|Another great performance by Johnny Depp.  Included Depp's humor.  The story line was great and would recommended to my friends.
0547884591|5.0|It's actually very simple: Learn to open your eyes like a young kid again. Be curious. Don't take anything for granted. Make mistakes, learn from them. Start again. Gain more knowledge. But enjoy it.<br /><br />Tim Ferris is a blueprint (a role model?) exactly for that. Of course there's chaos involved. He just wants the reader to make her own experiments and when some advice proofs wrong, so what? Blame the author? Then you don't understood the real magic of all his current books: A self-service store for ideas, concepts and often plain fun - TO BE HACKED BY YOURSELF.<br /><br />This book is so huge because life is so awesome you simply need a lot of more pics... while the hard facts fit on just a few pages. Right from the start you'll learn the concepts of \\"DSSS\\" and \\"CAFE\\", ways to deconstruct complex things into smaller parts, organizing and compressing them. You'll use these META concepts throughout the book on whatever topic that comes along.<br /><br />If you want a good story, read another book. If you want long lasting self-service store of ideas, take it.<br /><br />I'm giving 5-stars because contrary to other books it's a huge chance and a promise, something that can't be consumed and \\"finally\\" rated. Only time will tell. Enjoy.
B008220B0C|5.0|This is a wonderful feature into the life if Katy Perry. Truly anyone who enjoys her music will live this.

0316056863|4.0|Bossypants was uplifting and funny. I laughed out loud! We used this for our November book club book and many of the members commented that they were glad we picked it.
B007SGLZP8|2.0|A very disappointing book.  I usually enjoy his novels but this one left me with a vague sense of dissatisfaction after I had finished it.  Kept waiting for something original to happen but all I got was a totally far fetched plot which belied imagination.  So, some may feel it's a good fun book.  I didn't unfortunately.  Close to being rubbish in fact.
B005MVF65G|4.0|I loved this movie, it was pretty interesting for someone who was interested in the civil war time period. If you want to learn a little bit more about the conspiracy theory for Lincoln's assassination, then this is the movie for you.

B000G03S94|5.0|Black Holes and Revelations continues Muse's signature space rock sound at the same direction. Many songs from the album are more approachable and resonating especially their emotional tone and vocal. It has a better sound when it's one vinyl.
B000T433CO|5.0|My daughter and I have seen this movie a dozen times at least so we finally bought a commercial free copy.  We can even recite most of the lines - we are such saps.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|Seeing previews at the movies left me unprepared for the amount of backstory the author includes in the book.  That is actually what makes the book superior to any movie.  You really get to know the depth of the main character and his stuggle to simply understand all points of faith.  Inspirational.  Stick with it and you will be rewarded!
0062127241|5.0|Fantastic book - every bit as much an opera as Tommy and Quadrophenia.  Exquisitely written.  Petey, we can hear you!

B003VIWO8Y|4.0|Dave had more to do with forming the sound of Metallica  than they've ever admitted, proving what a bunch of whiny little phonies they really are. Megadeth was always the superior band, especially in the early days, when Kirk Hammett wasn't qualified to carry Chris Poland's guitar. They've never been in the same league. To not have Mustaine on stage with them for the hall of fame induction further confirms what I learned in a Denver bar one night in the early 90s; Metallica sucks.
B000AJIF4E|4.0|I am no &#34;professional&#34;, but I like to listen to music in good conditions. I like the quality of the audio. Also, it isolates quite well from ambient noises. And I did not have to pay a preposterous price for a pair of headphones.
0547884591|4.0|This is going to be a short & sweet review. I pre-ordered the book almost a year ago from Amazon and I have not been disappointed since I received it on launch day.
B007EECSFA|5.0|Great twists and turns.  The ending was unexpected!  I kept thinking that I had figured out the mystery, but I had not.  It was a good read.

B007CIQ4B2|5.0|Love, love, love this album. There is not one song on this album that I don't like...many of them seem to grow on you the more you listen to them as well.
B004EPYZTE|5.0|This movie was great. I got it as a present for my dad who is a huge Robert E Howard fan. He really enjoyed the movie. Just another piece to the Conan collection
B008B68IUY|5.0|For Collectors:<br /><br />Every inch of this car is covered in cool detail - a gargoyle gearshift, werewolf tail lights, filigree skull hubcaps, spiderweb seats and front grill, and art nouveau scroll work everywhere.  If you have the Scaris Monster High Dolls, the car is a wonderful addition to the collection.<br /><br />For Play:<br /><br />I believe this car will hold up to standard play, it seems quite sturdy.  There are fixed seat belts, and seating for four dolls.  I did check, and the dolls seem to easily fit in and out of the seat belts with no problems.  The only area I see that might be a little weak for play is the windshield, but I think it would take quite a bit of force to damage it.<br /><br />In Conclusion:<br /><br />As with all Monster High toys I would recommend getting this directly from Amazon ($24.99), and not a third party seller as they tend to ask ridiculous prices.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|this app is one of the handiest I have. I am continually reaching for my kindle to do a quick calculation without having to get up and go into the office. does the job quickly with never a problem yet.
B003B5M0PO|3.0|Well, I've now read two books told from the point of view of a horse. War Horse is okay, but pales in comparison to The Winter Pony. [[ASIN:0440239729 The Winter Pony]]<br />I think there are several reasons for this. 1. Many readers know about the horrific conditions of the trenches in WWI, but not so many of us know the details of Scott's trek to the pole and that makes The Winter Pony more intriguing. 2. War Horse has too many characters connected to the horse and the author is not able to build each enough to make the reader truly care about them. 3. Both books deal with difficult and dangerous conditions for the animals and men, but it is in the the ending of War Horse that this reader had the greatest disappointment - just too Pollyannish for me.
B00138GY5I|5.0|New album kinda sucks, but this one is a classic! One of my favorite albums even counting the rest of what I own!
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|This true story is the saga of remarkable recovery over addition and the the ultimate sacrifice of a member of Navy Seal Team Six.  God's gift to him was that he truly had no fear.  He and his team (and all those in the military) shovel the crap and piss out out the stables abroad so we can ride our horses here at home.  He gave all to God, family, and country.
B0018Q4DTY|4.0|Not bad but not that good either. I'll never put this album on to listen to but when it comes up on shuffle I'll listen.
B00AE2I4WK|5.0|It was an awesome movie it has a lot of dances and the main plot is nice the music is good and it's a really interesting movie

B005FISBTO|1.0|The show, and Michael C. Hall, remain superb, but this is a CRAP DVD set.  *Every* DVD in the set begins with two or three minutes of stupid commercials for junk you'd never watch, and the UOP (User Operation Prohibited) won't let you (1) go to the top menu and start playing the DVD you've bought, or even (2) skip past the commercials individually or en masse.  This is such a travesty, and an assault on people who like the series.  I'm beginning to think ROLLING STONE was right when they said \\"UOP killed the DVD\\"  -- at least in instances like this where it's so misused.  My advice is to NOT buy this set but rather wait to rent it from Netflix or get it from your local library.  You'll still have to (TIP) mute the sound and go away for a few minutes when it starts up, but at least you won't be encouraging this sort of consumer abuse.
B009P5K4HK|5.0|I never got to hear Amy live, and hearing this compilation of selected performances from BBC shows only makes one more wistful. The full range of human emotion is here in recordings that go as far back as 2004, with cuts from Frank, Back to Black, and other jazz/r&b standards. So much power and tenderness, so broad a range, so much more the loss. Miss you Amy, and what you could have done. This collection makes a remarkable and completely unforgettable reminder.
B005V2S7FW|4.0|I have had Last Pass for several years and have found nothing better.  It works super with a PC, but not nearly as well with Apple or Android.
B004I2K4DY|5.0|I first heard Les Mis when I was four and my dad was watching a VCR tape of the tenth anniversary concert. Ever since I have loved this musical and I will continue to enjoy it throughout my life. I originally heard this particular performance on PBS and recieved it as a birthday present. The songs have always been fantastic and the 25th aniversary performance has the best symphonic background music I've ever heard; the orchestra was much bigger this time than the 10th.  My only complaint is Nick Jonas. He doesn't do a good job playing Marius at all, however Lea Salonga, Samantha Barks, Alfie Bowe,and Norm Lewis did oustanding jobs as Fantine, Eponine, Valjean, and Javert. Even though some of them didn't look their part, their voices made up for it. Although I prefer the 10th Anniversary Dream Cast, This is an amazing performance and I highly reccomend it.
B0084U0IEG|3.0|The basic premise of Sweet Tooth at times seemed silly and loosely thought through. The story line is not captivating and some of the main characters seem &#34;off the shelf&#34;. Mcewan's writing is beautiful at times but overall it was a bit boring.
B0084U0IEG|5.0|By playing one genre (spy) against the other (romance), McEwan writes an engaging and finely written novel about mind/love games.
B001HN6922|5.0|This movie is very colorful... catches the kids eyes and keeps them entertained.. makes a really good family movie as well
B009HQ9UHC|3.0|this game is quite enjoyable and entertaining. the game itself is really unique and abstract. many will have different opinions about this game, but if you loved angry birds then this is a game for you.
B000H5U832|5.0|Great movie. Especially for the little guys. My two year old sits and watches the whole thing through saying vroom vroom the whole time
B005LAIHYU|3.0|What I love about history is that historical documents come to light all the time, and even though history doesn't change, one's view of history does.<br /><br />After watching this new biopic about Abraham Lincoln (not to be confused with the movie recently released, made by the guy who made ET and other memorable fictional movies) I have a new appreciation for the work of historians who painstakingly sift through old records in order to find new facts.  The result is this wonderful movie that sheds light on many of the choices Lincoln made.<br /><br />For example, it was his hatred to vampires that lead him to accept the huge losses inflicted on Union troops.  And if not for his dedication to the anti-vampire cause, this nation would be split.<br /><br />Abraham Lincoln was a great man, but he was a greater vampire hunter.  And in the end, the real lesson is that teach a man to kill a vampire, and you have a vampire killer for the life of the man; give an army silver bullets, and you save the world.<br /><br />The only fault is that I felt the movie took liberties in using composite characters to move the narrative.  The movie did not discuss that 3 of his 4 sons were killed by vampires.  It is well known that the person who avenged those murders was not Mary Todd, but General William Tecumseh Sherman in an ambush personally planned by Ulysses S Grant.
B00005JKNB|3.0|I bought this movie because I watched part of it on TV and wanted to see all of it.  I liked the movie overall but was disappointed with the ending.  However, I will watch it again several times.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|My family and I love dogs. When we came across this movie I love it. Cry alot! My nephew has two Akitas so I purchase the movie for him.
B009YU6FJM|5.0|Continuing on their riff driven, multi-layered musical path set forth as far back as Adrenaline, the Deftones have once again delivered a rocking album that I cannot get out of my head.
1416549447|5.0|After getting hooked on marathoning and discovering minimalism. I didn't think I could actually enjoy running even more. ChiRunning has done it! The body sense and that focus I need for a pleasant running experience are the big things I got from this book. If you are finding runs hard or not so enjoyable, read this book.
1863514201|4.0|The instructions seem clear, and the graphics provide good guidance for how to proceed, and what results should look like.  Some lovely projects are presented.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|My wife and I both thoroughly enjoyed this whimsical gem. It's intuitive and deceptively simple to play, but full of surprisingly complex solutions that will require some mental ingenuity to figure out.
1567184855|5.0|This is an amazing look into the lives we live in between our earth walk. It really resonated with me. Almost like a remembering.
B008KW43TE|5.0|Not sure if I'd label this hiphop, its kind of its own genre. Frank Ocean is a great artist, i am glad i bought this album!
B004H1V5RU|5.0|My 7 year old nephew loved this, and played with it right away. Very well made, and a good laugh to try even for adults.
B007NCSQFO|3.0|Bought this entire album for 2.99 on sale. I can't complain with that price and the number of songs i got! great value! fun pop songs and satisfies my hiphop obsession as well. Thanks Amazon!
B005FJ7DOM|4.0|A wonderfull movie that's infested with the living dead. Cannibalistic type Vampire violence overrun with brain eaters. Hordes of the invading dead, and people just can't seem to stop them. What a wonderful movie! If your ready to escape everyday life grab a beer sit back and watch this one. I LOVED IT!!
B005EHILV4|5.0|I purchased this unit becaue I was just not happy with the quality of audio that I get while using Skype.  I do some remote teaching via skype over the net with a school in Kenya East Africa. My video was incredibly improved when I purchased the Logitech 920 webcam, but I was still not happy with the audio. I have purchased several Behringer products in the past and have been very happy.<br /><br />First, the unit came in and it was much smaller than I thought it was. I use a Behringer 12 channel mixer next to my computer systems to route audio to my amp and studio monitors that I have on my desk. I had been using a usb conversion device (no controls on it) purchased from Radio Shack and it worked ok, but I was never wowed by the vocal output. I am using a Sure SM58 and noise muff.<br /><br />I expected this unit to sit side by side with my 12 channel output as an input device. It's barely 1/4 the size of the other unit. The moment I plugged it into the computer, it was recognized and installed. Skype immediately asked if I wanted to use it for output, then input. I declined the first, yet agreed to the second. I connected a Sure SM58 to the Multi connector and gave it a test... INSTANT CLEAR WONDERFUL sound. I then played and tweaked gain, mic level and tone controls to attain what I will call perfect audio input.<br /><br />I am incredibly pleased. To anyone doing podcasts, remote communication or even just chatting with the family, this device will do WONDERS for the sound of your voice. I will be trying out the line input as well, but this was purchased to enhance my voice, and wow, does it do the trick.<br /><br />I rarely write product reviews here on Amazon, but I really thought this one deserved some acclaim. Thanks for listening.
B0067EKY7M|4.0|What an unusual and sweet treat. Beautiful scenery, acting and theme. I thought it was a slo at the beginning, but the more I watch it, the more I like it!

B003V4AK8E|4.0|this is really a great controller, but too big for my grandson's hand.  He is 12 and still quite small.  He said it's great, but I think I need to wait until I grow some more.
B005LAIHXQ|3.0|im an avid movie watcher with about 10k movies. this movie was way over rated. the only reason i gave it 3 stars is because it has potential to being a great movie. this movie on the other hand is flawed in its script just one small example (noomi (female) goes to charlize (female) expensive med pod in her private quarters, to use the pod to remove her baby...pod tells her that it cant it was calibrated for men not women)..stupid stuff like that are through out the movie<br />if u want a movie that flows and u dont care to much about (why theres a huge dome over a spaceship) then ull get a 3 star movie.<br />charlize theron wanted to died in this movie on purpose....lol. im only saying that to help out her career cause shes hot and a great actress.
B002DD67XG|5.0|I am 33 years old and finally gave Mr. Taylor's music a chance.  I hit a hard spot in my life and needed some calming, soothing, but fun music.  I used to think his stuff was not for me, that it was for old people.  But now that I have matured a little, I have definitely gained an appreciation for Mr. Taylor's art.  They are classics.  Wonderfully simple lyrics.  Catchy stuff.  Uplifting.  Good for the soul.  And definitely fun!
B00000DATR|5.0|This is a really good cd very good extension of the original version of Tubular Bells, it is live but you can not tell.
B004TTMYQG|1.0|I can no longer open this app. It just repeatedly gives me a popup saying \\"Internet Needed, Please connect to the internet to run this app\\". I am connected to the internet, I can check email, browse the internet and use any other internet based app but this one. I can even open the Amazon App store and browse in there. I have even rebooted my phone and the app still will not work. I don't know what you guys did, but fix it! BTW, why is this thing requiring an internet connection to begin with? My calendar data is synced locally and handled by Goggle, so I see no reason why internet needs to be required for this app to work. What am I supposed to do when in airplane mode?
B008D1RCI6|5.0|This is a very good cd ,very interesting words and music, a long time coming,he has taken a long time to get this cd out there.
B008VBYN80|3.0|The game is alright to spend 5 minutes here or there on, but you need to spend real money if you want to get into it more.  Also, it isn't explained at all how to add friends, which you need to do certain things in the game.
B005XOPEOU|5.0|I was not really a fan of Coldplay until Mylo Xyloto. I find this album to be a beautifully written, exciting, and soulful album.  I particularly like that they have a number of upbeat, almost pop-like songs that contrast to their more lullaby sound.  Although the album is best known for the tracks &#34;Every Teardrop is a Waterfall,&#34; &#34;Paradise,&#34; and &#34;Princess of China,&#34; there are a number of other tracks that are equally as pleasing such as &#34;Up in Flames&#34; and &#34;Don't let it Break Your Heart.&#34; I feel that this is a more adventurous album for Coldplay that moves away from the slow, melodic tones they are used to and moves into a more alternative and pop sound that is commercially pleasing to a wider audience.  I very much enjoy this album and look forward to their next album.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I wish I had read the book before I saw the movie. I can't wait to read the next book.
B0002858YS|5.0|Hot Fuss is still my favorite Killers album.  When it was released this type of electronic alternative rock was just becoming popular and it contrasted so sharply with the popular R&B and pop sounds that were out there.  &#34;Mr. Brightside&#34; remains one of my favorite songs with the synthesized voices, electronic guitar and dance beats.  There are plenty of tracks to keep you entertained and enjoying this fast paced album!
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|I have always wondered why such hype over Angry Birds. After all this time I was finally able to play it. I was kind of surprised. I don't find it addictive like most people do but I have to say, it really is a fun game. I'm playing it on the Kindle Fire HD and the movements are fluent and the screen is crystal clear.<br /><br />I would highly recommend it for anyone needing to kill some time.
B000GY729M|3.0|I found Sam's Town to be a much slower album than Hot Fuss.  Many of the songs are more lullaby in tone and melodic.  It's a much different sound for the Killers and I'm not sure that I like it that well.  The album has a very somber tone to it that contrasts sharply with Hot Fuss.  Interestingly, this is the first album that the Killers did not use auto-tune with.  Therefore, Brandon Flowers' voice is really heard on these tracks which gives it a much more authentic feel.  Overall, it's not my favorite Killers album but it does include a number of good tracks including &#34;When You Were Young.&#34;
0061474355|5.0|My wife introduced me to this book, and it has quickly become my favorite contemporary work of fantasy. Not only does Nix present refreshingly original ideas (this is NOT just another re-imagining of Tolkien), he does so with intelligence and wit. I actually learned a few new words while reading Sabriel, without feeling like the author was trying to show off his vocabulary.<br /><br />Nix's treatment of magic is intriguingly original. There are elements of the classic manifestations of magic (magic words, gestures, etc.), but he adds a new facet: sound and music. The best mages in Nix's world use instruments and their own musical talents to cast their most powerful spells.<br /><br />Nix's reinterpretation of death and the afterlife is also unusually and refreshingly new. His description (or artistic lack thereof) of the seven gates and precincts of death is fascinating. As I read, I found myself on the edge of my seat on many occasions. I don't normally go for zombie/undead stories, but Nix's is written and crafted so well, I couldn't help but be swept away by it.
B003JBHQP4|4.0|I have many photographs so I wanted to back them up onto individual memory cards but my computer does not have a slot for memory cards so I purchased this Amazon Basics USB 2.0 Flash Memory Card Reader.  The actual quality and craftsmanship of the product is okay- it's not fancy and I think that it is not extremely durable but it does the job.  I particularly like that I can use 21 different types of memory cards with this reader which makes it very versatile and functional.  The upload and download speed for this reader is fairly fast and I've been pleased with the quality of the uploads/downloads.  It's compact and light weight enough to travel with me in a small electronics bag which I also really enjoy.  If you are looking to back up your files or photographs on memory cards, I would highly suggest this product.  It's another great addition to the Amazon Basics line that I am becoming a fan of!
B008GVD6D8|5.0|I can't wait for the next book to come out should be interesting i have enjoyed both the books so far.
B00486070K|3.0|I use this Apple USB Ethernet Adapter with my MacBook Air to connect to the internet when WiFi is not available (in certain hotels, cafés, and libraries).  It works about 50% of the time.  I'm unsure whether or not that is the fault of the adapter or perhaps the establishment's ethernet.  When it does work though, it works well.  It's a bit slower than if you had an ethernet port directly in your computer but I'm still able to send/receive emails (with attachments!) and visit different websites.  One of my complaints is that the cord on this adapter is VERY short- maybe 4 inches which means you really need to have a long ethernet cord.  If not, you might accidentally pull the adapter out which has happened to me on several occasions. The adapter is very small and light weight so it can be easily transported with your laptop.  Just know that this may not work every single time.
B005CWRB44|4.0|I recently purchased this light, for every day carry, to replace another Fenix single-cell light I'd lost (and later found), the PD10.<br /><br />Brightness-wise, this E15 model measures up to the PD10 pretty well, though the PD10 did have a slightly brighter center \\"hotspot.\\"  The PD10 also seems to cast a better-defined outer area of light, beyond the bright center area than this E15.  For my purposes, neither is really any better than the other.  The PD10, by the way, did a great job of lighting up the interior of a small sushi restaurant during a power outage, some time back.  I just set it on the table, pointed up at the ceiling (a feat some push button tail cap lights have trouble with), and our table continued with our dinner and drinks.  I'd expect the E15 to perform similarly well.<br /><br />The only real \\"problems\\" I have with the light are the lack of a clip and the lack of a spring contact for the battery, the latter of which means it rattles around a bit in the light when it's turned off.  Neither is a dealbreaker for me, though.  The PD10 had a clip, and I still managed to lose it.  Besides, the E15 is about a half inch shorter than the PD10, so I'm able to just stick it into the \\"watch\\" pocket on my jeans and forget about it.<br /><br />Overall, a nice little light for the price.
0312323867|5.0|So what happened to Darcy after the conclusion of Something Borrowed? Giffin does a great job of continuing the story, though this time with Darcy as the protagonist in Something Blue.  It's important you read Something Borrowed first to understand who Darcy is and how she got to where she is at the beginning of the book.  Although you could probably start with Something Blue as Giffin does provide a nice recap (from Darcy's perspective, of course!) of what happened, I think it's better to start with Borrowed as you get a fuller understanding of Darcy's personality.  I have to admit, I really hated Darcy's character in Borrowed, even if I did end up feeling a bit sorry for her.  She was the personification of egotistical.  But in Something Blue, Darcy undergoes an amazing transformation and truly grows as an individual emotionally (and literally!).  You start to see a more human and mature side to Darcy.  I ended up liking this story way more than I liked Borrowed.  Ethan is the main male protagonist in this book and I love how the friendship between Darcy and him change and evolves.  We even get to see a glimpse of Dex and Rachel! Overall, I would HIGHLY recommend this book- one of my favorite books in recent years.  As with any Giffin book, it's important to remember that this falls under the &#34;chick lit&#34; category.  So don't expect something extremely serious, deep, or even very realistic. It's supposed to be a fun, romantic, breezy read which it definitely accomplishes.
1400052181|5.0|This may be my most favorite book to date.  Well written, engaging, thought provoking, and humanizing - thanks for telling Henrietta's story!
0547884591|5.0|This is the third book I've read from Tim. Each one grows from the other. I have to say this is the best of all 3. Maybe because it has my secret dream to be a Profesional Chef, and topics in this book will bring me close to that, without having to attend a culinary institute.  Even though my current profession is not even involve cooking for anyone, the skills I learn from Tim will keep my dream alive. Thanks Tim for such a great book.
0545265355|5.0|The Hunger Games Trilogy is an incredible story line and is well worth reading, much better than going to the movies as your imagination is more creative than a big screen. I received the trilogy is excellent condition and very fast. This is worth the buy if this interests you and your children.
B005NFW0U0|5.0|I was so excited to be able to watch the season without having to wait for it on Netflix or having to pay the high price for it on DVD!!
B00138EZLI|5.0|I just loved it.  The Georgia Mass Choir is awesome!  If you're unsure about getting it, rest assured that You won't regret it.
0547569653|5.0|Super easy and fun to read, I love this book!<br /><br />Its a very light book, not to long, not to dense, not to deep.<br /><br />Scott does go into depth of his soul though and you feel a solid connection with him as he exposes the good and the bad and even some of his personal relationships.<br /><br />The recipes found at the end of each chapter are really great! I've used several of them several times and plan to use others. What makes the recipes good is that they're not just cut out of some random vegan cook book, you can really tell he uses these recipes and has adjusted them to his running lifestyle. You get honest Jurek recipes and I loved that!<br /><br />The tips for running that he also provides at the end of each chapter were stupid and not need for me.<br /><br />Great book, highly recommended for any runner of any kind. Also recommended for any vegan or vegetarian wondering about athletics and food.
141659521X|4.0|another wonderful read. i look forward to these great books since i no longer see 24. keep them coming. read the book
0062124293|5.0|Very funny book! It's a bit more crass and vulgar than I was expecting, but I'm not one to complain about that!<br /><br />I recommend this to everyone... really, if you're thinking about the feminist ideology for any reason, this is going to be the most enjoyable way for you to get into it!
B000OZ0NXA|3.0|I started this novel with a lot of enthusiasm, and for around 100 pages, that enthusiasm remained intact. However, after a while the author's style began to irritate me. Really? Five-hundred pages of staccato prose. Not only that, the characters are somewhat cardboard, and their motivations are laid out through heavy-handed exposition. Having said all that, I really liked the first three-hundred or so pages, but then grew tired of the book and had to force myself to pick it up and finish it. Even the action scenes are described without flair. I'm really puzzled at the popularity of this character, but maybe the books get better later on in the series . . . ? I won't be reading any to find out, but I can mildly recommend this book as a semi-enjoyable escape.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|I'm sure I am only going to echo what scores of other people have said here... this show is really terrific, and ranks among the best shows on TV today. This coming from a person that is decidedly NOT into period pieces. But I am HOOKED. Cannot wait for the new season to start airing on PBS, and definitely looking forward to watching the UK version to get all the bits and pieces that they figured the American audience didn't have the patience or mental capacity for.
B002JVWRAO|5.0|Great DVD great prices Purchased for a Xmas gift and there were well appreciated will buy season 7 soon def!
0547884591|4.0|great book, very entertaining.  purchased it on my kindle and will be buying a hard cover as well as i feel some of the info will be easier to follow that way.
B003Y5HWMW|5.0|I am blown away with how good of a job HBO did with bringing George R.R. Martins' \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\" series first book \\"A Game of Thrones\\" to TV.  The acting is phenominal (especially Peter Dinklage as Tyrion Lanister), the story is as involved and complex as the book, the sets/props/locations...evertyhing is all top notch.  They followed the first book pretty faithfully as well.  I actually went back and read the book after I watched the show...and continued on to all the rest of the books and finished with the latest in the series, \\"A Dance With Dragons\\" just so I could find out what happened.  Then I went back and watched the entire season again on HBO GO.  Then I watched it again on Blu-Ray before season 2 started.  And I'm probably going to watch it again before season 2 gets released on Blu-Ray so I can watch season 2, followed by season 3 on HBO.<br /><br />My only complaint is I wish they had been able to make the season more episodes!  I don't think they had to abbreviate anything important, but I just want MORE!
B002JVWR4A|5.0|If you like Bones, and want to watch it whenever you want, then season 5 is for you! What more can I say?
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|I did not find any pornography ads but instead it is a very cool game.  addidcting and fun for all ages.
B0058YPL66|5.0|This is a great series, at first I was spectacle but it quickly draws you in. My favorite character has to be Rumple and well everyone else is fun to. Granted at points it can be cheesy, for ex. how often Charming loses Snow, but the re-imagining of the stories you know themselves, is great. Beauty and the Beast and Red Riding Hood were so different, but it worked. You find yourself wondering about everyone's past and guessing who's who. Just overall a great series give it a chance.
B00ADYYY50|5.0|I have been a fan of Wiz Khalifa for years, beginning around the time of \\"Say Yeah\\" and his earlier mixtapes. The album 'Rolling Papers' had a lot to offer, but was a very unexpected twist for many fans. What I quickly realized was that Wiz was going for his own creations and making music that he felt was true to himself and his life, which has changed drastically ever since his younger 'Prince of the City' days. 'O.N.I.F.C.' provides fans with motivational songs, catchy hooks, greatly flowed verses, and interesting beats. There are a couple of songs that I believe could have been left off of the album, including \\"Fall Asleep.\\" It doesn't fit all that well with the rest lf the album. However, the majority of this album has a lot more to offer than most fans will give it credit for. This is Wiz Khalifa's vision of where he is at in the game and how hard he has worked to get there. There should be no fearing or resenting of the \\"new\\" Wiz Khalifa. He is making choices relevant to his reality. His work ethic, as he describes, is highly remarkable, and for that, continues to have my respect and appreciation as a fan.<br /><br />5/5
B00AE2J5HI|1.0|I did not like this movie, for several reasons. The biggest reason was because it was REALLY drawn out. I like long movies typically, but this one just took forever to end (despite the good acting). I guess it was really the plot that was lacking. Not worth your rent if you ask me.
B000641D2Y|5.0|Good movie never get tire of watching this movie and glad I ordered can go wrong when you buy new or used
B00A0SMTXS|5.0|Lots of action . Very mind troubleing whats real who are you . Twist trun  hand to hand action thats what you get with this movie its good
B000VBJEEG|5.0|Well made and have seen it so many times. The story line is great, keeps it interesting and has some good humor. Great buy for $14.
B009G7ZYPY|2.0|Susan Boyle's music is officially dead.  She doesn't sing the songs.  She just talks the songs.  She could have picked some peppier songs.  MOTN sounds better with just Crawford.  The song is meant for a male only.  I thought it would be fun to hear Donny and Susan together but it's not.  It's a trainwreck.  Susan sounds like a baby trying to sing grown up songs.  Two stars is the best I can do.  A two day delivery is more like a week delivery.
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|We love it. Our kid loves it and we have seen it umpteen times but never get tired of it. Great buy for $14.
B009SH5JS4|5.0|Kate (Meg Ryan) and Charlie (Timothy Hutton) are engaged and even have a house in mind. However Charlie has to go to a medical convention in Paris. Kate is afraid of flying so she stays home in her newly adopted country, Canada; that is until Charlie finds a French goddess (Susan Anbeh) and calls the whole thing off. Kate won't stand for this and gets up the courage to fly. On her way, she meets an obnoxious Frenchman Luc Teyssier (Kevin Kline). Little does she realize that their paths will cross again and again.<br /><br />As in the movie \\"Boys' Night Out (1962) with Kim Novak\\", Kate, Charlie, and Luc, only know what they are supposed to want in life. They pursue their wants until they find that they really want something different than they were supposed to want. That is a lot of wants.<br /><br />Lots of action, one-liners and great music (French Kiss: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack.) I notice that all the time Kate is in Paris that she just misses seeing the Eiffel Tower by a few seconds. She does find an Eiffel Tower souvenir that reminds her of Luc.<br /><br />Everyone is perfect for the part. I would almost thing that Kevin Kline was French. Laurent Spielvogel plays the Concierge and has the attitude that Johnny Carson always says the French have. Even Jean Reno (birth (location) Casablanca, Morocco) seems exceedingly French.<br /><br />[[ASIN:6302985293 Boys' Night Out [VHS]]]

1451627297|1.0|I won't get into the style of the book, which has been well-described by others, but I will ask ONE question: (spoiler alert) The protagonist spends a geologic amount of time and energy determining with absolute certainly that Lee Harvey Oswald did, indeed, assassinate Kennedy before stopping him (maybe). But, but, but...the book also goes to great lengths to posit that each step through the \\"wormhole\\" is a complete reset, in other words, every time you go through the wormhole you undo everything that you did the last time you were there.<br /><br />So...why doesn't the protagonist just go through the wormhole, kill Oswald IMMEDIATELY (instead of waiting 5 long, long years) and then go home to 2011 to see if he was right? If he was, then great. Mission accomplished! And if he wasn't, well then, just step through the wormhole again for five seconds and undo it! I mean, I'm ALL FOR the suspension of disbelief, but if the author is going to go to great lengths to establish conventions concerning the paradox of time travel, then shouldn't he abide by them? At least a little?
B009UX2YAC|5.0|my great option for subway surfers is that this game is a wonderful kid game that may or may not hold their attention for a long time depending on gender. it also is an amazing game to learn how to controlled your reactions. some parents might find it really fun to see how many characters that you can collect and also the money and to see how far you can get and find many mysteriy boxes to. like I said this a very a joyable game to play when you feel lazy.
B000002OX7|3.0|I was just looking for a good CD version of the vinyl original.  I guess I got that.  The additions don't grab me.<br /><br />Sound quality seems good.
B002RI98BA|5.0|If you want to know all about Lincoln and get an exhaustive history lesson on the political scene during his rise to the top then this is the book for you.  Team of Rivals is an easy read and I always look forward to picking it up because the writer transports you to the age of Lincoln.  I recommend it to anyone interested in getting an in-depth look into Lincoln's life.
B008FPZQRO|5.0|For many years Emerson, Lake, and Palmers \\"Tarkus\\", their second studio lp, was and still is one of my favorite progressive/classic rock albums of all time. Released in 1971 after the release of the hugely successful first lp, Tarkus was and is still ahead of it's time. Releasing a side long suite of the title track was unheard of in 1971, but ELP pulled it off. ELP hardly ever was this aggressive and ferocious in their musicianship. Keith Emerson and Carl Palmer play so wonderfully together, the layers of keyboards and drums, just fit together and with such precision, this track has to be heard to be believed. And of course Greg Lake vocals and beautiful guitar playing, just round everything out. And now the first two ELP lp's have been released in Deluxe Editions, and you can't ask for more. I picked up both, and was very pleased with how they have both been handled. Each edition carries 3 discs, 2 compact discs, and a 3rd Dvd audio disc. Disc 1 contains the original remastered lp. The second disc contains, brand new 2012 stereo altenate mixes of the songs, plus some unreleased tracks. Disc 3 is where most people will want to look into. It contains brand new high bitrate Advanced Resolution 5.1 surround sound mixes of the lp's, and also high resolution stereo mixes of songs taken directly from the original master tapes. Unfortunately some of the original masters for the first lp have either dissapeared or are missing, so one or two of the 5.1 mixes of songs (Tank with drum solo, and most of The Three Fates) from the first lp are not included. Also the ending of \\"Knife Edge\\" is different due to mixing problems. These tracks are substituted with other tracks to fill out the lp as close as possible to the original. It almost works but not perfect. You can listen to the whole complete lp in remastered stereo tho, and it still sounds wonderful. As far as \\"Tarkus\\" goes, the whole complete lp is mixed into beautiful Advanced Resolution (which is the highest quality) 5.1 surround sound and if any lp should be heard in surround, this is it. Originally recorded in 16 track stereo, the sound now opens and expands like originally intended. The album is clean, with nice bass response, spacious rear activity, and much more detail than ever before. Once again, the keyboards, and drums and percussion have to be heard to be believed. You will never hear \\"Tarkus\\" sound better. It is a beautiful listening experience. You must have a Dvd audio player with correct analog audio connecting cables to hear it uncompressed in Advanced Resolution Surround or Stereo, although you can also hear it in excellent DTS 5.1 (no Dolby Digital) and High Resolution Stereo on regular dvd players (with standard optical cable hookup). You also get nice reproductive lp covers, photos, liner notes explaining the history of the lp's. So although slightly dissapointed with the first lp (although it is understandable) I am extremely pleased with the 2nd lp, so all in all, I highly recommend both of these Deluxe Editions for either the die hard ELP fans or even new listeners who would like to get a true introduction to just how great a band ELP were and still are. I am sure the rest of ELP's original lp's will be released in same Deluxe Editions in the not so distant future. This was a group whose recorded output should be heard in the highest format possible.surround sound and if any lp should be heard in surround, this is it.

B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I thought that this book had a great plot, character development, and plot twists.<br />It is definitely worth a read, very original.
B0035JRVBO|5.0|I was needing this for a gift for christmas. Instead of going into a crazy busy store i just got it here. This was the best thing i could have done. It arrived on time like they said it would. the package was not damaged or anything. I will continue to do my christmas shopping here.
B0060FXBNM|1.0|i was so excited to see a boxed set of the movies....that i didn't do my usual research. this box set came in a very cheap and flimsy box.  i bought it for my husband, didn't open it for a month ( i was hiding it for his bday).  boy was i sad when i wrapped it.  i felt so bad giving him a bent box with minimalistic videos.  no se or anything!  so sad to see sellers putting out such poor quality items.
1440503257|4.0|First and foremost, I am a Potterhead so when I saw this cookbook available on AmazonVine, I had to request it. When the Harry Potter books finally came to an end, I loved the series so much, I read all seven books all over again. I ran the gamut of emotions while reading these beloved books, I laughed, I cried.... I developed a crush on Professor Snape.<br /><br />Hogwarts is the literary place I'd most like to visit. (Go Slytherin) I'd want to drink Butterbeer and eat treats from Honedukes candy shop. What better than a Harry Potter inspired cookbook for my shelves? I found it nice that with each recipe, the author includes a quick description and tells us which Harry Potter book the recipe is from. She also gives a background of the origins of the foods or on what Americans might call the dish versus what those in England refer to it. I found all this to be a nice touch.<br /><br />My one qualm about this cookbook is that there are no photos or diagrams for reference. I like to bake and cook and I enjoy trying out new recipes, but I need a photo of some sort to go by. As soon as I opened this cookbook, I instantly noticed there were no photos, and that was a real letdown.<br /><br />I thought this cookbook was aimed at a younger audience, which again brings me to the pictures issue. The recipes are varied, some are easy, some more difficult and I think photos would help greatly.<br /><br />There are simple recipes like Sugar Biscuits, Hot Chocolate, English Tomato Ketchup and Queen Victoria's Soup, which I can imagine kids would enjoy making with parental supervision.<br />Then there's the more complex recipes for the ambitious like Bouillabaisse, Chocolate Eclairs, and Haggis, which calls for sheep's lung, heart and liver, that I can't imagine children wanting to cook (or eat) but that depends on what is customary to them.<br /><br />I made the Big Fluffy Pancakes. The recipe was simple to follow, the ingredients were all things I already had at home. I was surprised to see the juice of one lemon is added to the mix, and it's a nice touch. The pancakes were yummy.<br /><br />\\"In the wizarding world this dish is called Cauldron Cakes. Harry sees them for the first time on the witch's trolley on board the Hogwarts Express in Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. He generously shares with Ron, who finds his dry corned beef sandwich unappealing.\\"<br />p.41, The Unofficial Harry Potter Cookbook<br /><br />The chapters have cute names like Good Food with Bad Relatives and Treats from the Train. I think this cookbook makes for a nice gift or collectors item for any Potterhead. While the novelty appeal is great, the execution could have been better.<br /><br />**I am an amazon affiliate and received this book from AmazonVine. This review is my honest opinion. I did not receive any type of compensation for reading and reviewing this book. While I receive free books from publishers and authors, I am under no obligation to write a positive review.rised to see the juice of one lemon is added to the mix, and it's a nice touch.

B004I1AGTC|5.0|because it come fast shipping ,<br />its very original even the cover in the box of the dvd , i really liked it<br />im happy with it , this is a true story ,watched it 9 times already . this is a great movie its in english spoken .
B005LAIIDU|5.0|Wow, I seriously don't give out that many 5 stars reviews, but this one I had no problem what so ever. I can't believe it myself. It was just that super, amazing, great Disney film that I haven't seen for a long while.<br /><br />Why is this movie so good? Disney somehow managed to make a movie that works for both little kids and kept the adults still loving it too. Yes, this movie is still gears towards the little kids more, but that's okay, because most likely you're watching this with a little kid(s) anyways.<br /><br />Can a \\"bad guy\\" be really a \\"good guy\\"? For once in his life? Forever...maybe? Let see, yes he can! Wreck-IT-Ralph is about Ralph who is a video game bad guy and he was programmed to be a bad guy and he loves it! But, after awhile of doing bad things, he starts to feel he wants to be more than just the bad guy in his game and maybe be a good guy for once? Maybe even get a shinny medal on the way.<br /><br />You would think a zebra can't change his strips, but nothing impossible and even more so in this movie. Ralph went through a roller coaster of events and he actually did get a medal in this new game called Hero's Duty. Maybe he didn't get the medal the way it was supposed to get it, but it's his and he earned it his way. lol You will find it very funny yourself, once you see him get it.<br /><br />However, in unfortunate of events happened right after Ralph gets his medal. The medal he just won, then is lost too. Now comes in Vanellope a glitch in this new game that Ralph is in called Sugar Land. Vanellope is a very funny and playful character. She is also a glitch in the game and wants to become a true racer. Ralph of course hates her because she lost Ralph's medal, but now they both need each other help. Ralph will get back his medal and Vanellope can become a true racer, if they work together. This was very funny to watch for kids and adults alike.<br /><br />What adults will find very funny is the video game jokes, if you were into video games back then of course. If you weren't then some of the references may fly by over yourself, but that's okay because there more to this movie than just jokes. This movie is also about friendship, wanting something so much that you do anything for, making tough choices in life, and finally self sacrificing one life to save someone else.<br /><br />I left out a lot of things, and it is just too much to put down. I also don't want to spolier it for you and want you to watch this movie. I recommend this movie to everyone!!!
B005LAIGN2|5.0|thanks it was fast sshipping ,<br />plus its original and perfact screen play .<br />happy with the DVD<br />EVERY ONE WHO LIKE AIR CRAFTS FIGHTERS , THIS MOVIE IS THE ONE FOR YOU !!!! :)<br />I CANT STOP WATCHING IT . 6 times i seen it over and over :)
0307346609|5.0|I chose this rating because it arrived exactly as described. New and more than on time.  I haven't read the book because it is a gift but it seems great for the cost.  I would recommend this book to type of read.
B009K45Y62|5.0|I still don't understand why people nit pick so much with TDKR. My only guess would be that because Nolan didn't want to make his Batman movies like others in past, with freak accidents, a bit more comicy and a little supernatural and instead to make his movies a bit more real to the real world. And I think he did a great job with that. I think people took that to literally and feel as if every small detail or problem must be able to be fitted into our real world. Its still a movie and That's the thing people forget.
B00065F86U|3.0|I really have to buy this separately from the battery, and then the charger separately too. WAY too much money to get the extra FPS when shooting......<br /><br />Pros:<br />1/3 parts to get the extra FPS<br /><br />Cons:<br />EXPENSIVE<br />PLASTIC
0547884591|4.0|This book is a great learner's tool. I work in a restaurant and want to scoff at the simplicity, but knowing Tim and his other writings I know it will work. As usual he is breaking the paradigms and breaking them down to easily useful components. He is only covering the first 20%, which, if you get really into a subject will make you look for other sources of information anyway.
B000002GBB|4.0|Started off weak with songs like:\\"I'm ok and Great White Hope\\", but finished strong. Standout songs were for me: \\"Sing For The Day, Queen Of Spades and Renegade\\". The album could have been better but a few songs I found a bit dumb.
0547884591|5.0|There is a lot of confusion out there over Tim Ferriss. So let me tell you what made me rate this 5 stars:<br /><br />1) A comprehensive book on learning. COOKING IS THE METAPHOR. The path to cooking is a key part of the book but the most important aspect is the experimentation and small tests that lead to large results in a short period of time. There is not DOZENS of topics covered in this book, there is one--learning. And cooking is the main method to show this.<br /><br />2) The inspiration it offers. Some people here have interpreted all these things Tim has done as bragging. The thing is, there are many \\"experts\\" and \\"gurus\\" that tell you to do things that they have never actually done. Tim on the other hand proves the unprovable and shows you how he did it. The point is not to brag, but to inspire the reader to go out of their comfort zone by providing a method of least resistance to seeing large results.<br /><br />3) The entertainment value. What's the point of reading a book if it's not great fun to read and enjoy.<br /><br />As a conclusion, let me say that there are many books out there that cover the things that the four hour chef covers in a much more detailed manner. HOWEVER, it's also true that none of those specific books agree with other specific books in that same genre. In other words dieting books written by Doctors (Medical and otherwise)and experts with years of experience disagree on basic principles on most occasions (liquid diets vs Paleo vs Low fat vs slow-carb) over their own advice. What Tim Ferriss does is says \\"I talked to ________ professional about __________ subject so I tried ________, ________, and ________. My result was ___________. What Tim does, is he cuts through the crap, and helps teach you how to cut through crap yourself.
B000002GB4|4.0|It's good but not quite as good as previous ones. Songs like \\"Jennifer\\" and \\"Schooz\\" were kinda lame. The rest were great but this is an album that I certainly ain't repeating over and over like the others.
B0084U0IEG|4.0|Not the first book of his I have read.  Really enjoyed it - especially since I was around in the early 70's!!
B000002GB2|5.0|Fantastic rock album. All songs except for one are my favorites. Straight up rock with grand tracks like: \\"Light Up, Lorelei, Born For Adventure and Suite Madame Blue\\". This is the definite Styx album.
B0042FZOFU|5.0|Alrighty my fellow Amazonians =P I'm not going to spend time going into the movies themselves because I'm sure you've seen it and love it, and if you haven't you do love it, you just don't know it yet. This combo pack includes all 3 movies along with the usual extra features (\\"deleted scenes\\", outtakes, commentary, and shorts), individual movie cases for each, and one bonus disc for Toy Story 3. The individual cases are nothing special, and the box sleeve is basic (in my case the corners also had wear from being moved around even though I bought it new).<br /><br />I know with some bluray movies they also include the DVD copy and a digital download. Let me be clear, that is NOT the case with this one. You only get the Bluray movies. While I would have liked that addition, for the price and being bluray, I still give this a 5 star rating.
B007N6EUHI|4.0|I love this program. This is intended for a medical person or student in a related field I don't see this program being of great benefit or interest to the general public, unless of course you plan on studying anatomy or need detailed anatomically accurate images of a specific organ system for other projects.<br /><br />The program allows for 3D manipulation of the images. You can add and subtract parts of the image, for instance if you are looking at the brain you can remove a part to see the underlying layer or add the blood vessels ..etc.<br /><br />The level of detail is adequate for a student or advanced school course, but it is not the level of detail needed for medical school or similar level. It is still very useful for medical students as a study aid and I recommend it without hesitation.<br /><br />I am an MD myself and find it very useful to demonstrate to patients on ipad or adnroid tablet what the anatomy of the involved part looks like, look at it from different views, magnify, show the blood supply and so on.<br /><br />I also found it very interesting for me to review the human anatomy for organ systems I do not use in my primary specialty and now use it to quiz myself all the time.<br /><br />There are still some technical hickups that need to be ironed out, but as it is as of the time of this review December 2012, it is good enough to be a very useful app.<br /><br />I have it on android and ipad it is a bit sluggish on Samsung 10.1 tab 2. surprisingly faster on the the Samsung Galaxy 2 phone and also fast on the iphone 4s.<br /><br />I recommend this app, but I think the price should be $15-20.<br /><br />An excellent and free alternative for PC is the google \\"body browser\\" project which is now zygotebody.com . But you need to be online and requires webGL enabled browser (firefox works fine) and latest video card driver for your computer. Can also be viewed on android but only with firefox as of 12/2012  Free and very useful, give it a try.
B002BWP49M|5.0|Amazing movie and look forward in completing the rest of the series so I can have a movie marathon at home
B00004Z4WR|5.0|My husband wanted both the original movie and this dvd. He will be extemely happy that I found both for Christmas.
B0051UP5NQ|4.0|I use this to take notes and create Word documents for the most part and it has worked extremely well. I either create the documents on my Kindle or open from email to edit, after which I usually email the documents to work and continue working on them. It has worked very well. I also like the intuitive inerface and the organization of my documents. If you have hundreds of documents you might need more organization tools, but for the type of work I would guess most people use their tablets for, this has been by far the best out of all the office apps I have tried.
B000PKX2KA|5.0|Worked like a charm after installing the needed drivers. Working on both Microsoft Streets and Trips, and Delorme Street Atlas.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|works very well. Makes the kindle much easier to hold on to and it props up for easier movie watching
0671015206|5.0|If you think you might have what it takes to become and millionaire and more, this is a great read for you - it helps to set straight many misconceptions, and shows you that things (and people) often aren't what they might look like.
0547884591|5.0|My husband and I are doing the slow carb diet together and these recipes were much needed.  Everyone in my family is benefitting from healthier eating.  Our favorite is the cauliflower mash, using coconut milk to boil the cauliflower is yummy and we think tastes better than rice.  This book even inspired me to start taking a language class and learn Estonian.  I love all the little tricks and bits of information throughout this book.  I would recommend getting a hard copy and not the digital version (or get both) as you will be constantly going back to look at recipes, lists, tips and more.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|Thought it was a great continuation of the story; the only thing I found lacking was the background on Gideon.  Hope Sylvia goes into depth on that with the next book.
B005R32L66|1.0|The download would provide too much access to personal information on my phone.  I chose not to install this application.
1609611543|5.0|Little known facts about wheat and how it could cause health problems in sensitive individuals are brought out in this easy to read book.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book just gets better and better..Definitely recommended if you have read the first book..  Less emphasis on the eroticism but more into the story line.... Couldn't put it down..... Laters, baby...
B007SGLZP8|5.0|One of the very best!  Chapter after chapter became more intriguing!  Thank you for one of the best of the best in quite a long time.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Despite the eroticism of the book, the story line is such that keeps you reading and wanting more.<br />  This book has deep underlying themes of control and sexism and would be a great starting point in any boy-girl relationship. Just how much do you want to give up your identity and how far will you go for the man you love.  Ms. Steele portrays a strong figure and one a girl must have to keep the relationship in balance.  She is the rock in many ways.  Mr. Grey, has deep rooted problems from childhood that are dealt with in the storyline.  The eventual ending is dramatic and well done.  Will there be more to this trilogy - a sexology?  One can only hope for... Laters baby....
1451695195|2.0|Based on the title, I thought that this was a story of a legitimate NDE, where the author experienced the presence of Jesus Christ. Instead, this author describes an NDE experience that includes New Age rhetoric. Yes, I I do believe that Dr. Alexander had a true NDE experience, but based on the authority of the Christian Holy Bible, he was truly deceived. Dr. Alexander, while in a comatose state, was impacted by and taken on an &#34;other world&#34; journey by malevolent spirit guides who seduced him into believing that a beautiful and wonderful existence awaits all of us lowly mortals after death, irregardless of our acceptance of Jesus Christ, The Son of God. In fact there is not one mention of the name of Jesus Christ in the entire book. Jesus said &#34;I am the way, the truth and the light...&#34; There are no alternative paths to The Father and to heaven. If you believe the Holy Bible then this IS NOT a good read for you. However, I if you enjoy being deceived or are into New Age philosophy then this book is for you.
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|Not what you expect.  Very different in style and content.  I light view on a tragic event about to enfold.<br /><br /> I enjoyed it immensely.
B0052RDHTM|4.0|Excellent historical novel but for the sometimes stodgy prose and often confusing plot. I will read more of his books.
B00AE2IJIE|5.0|Good and very well written story, great message, the witch sequence animation is stunning. Watch it. You won't be disappointed.
0547884591|5.0|Remember that science video that took you out to the stars and down into the atoms*? This book is like that, but you get to hold the remote control and zoom in and out on delicious food.<br /><br />THE AWESOMEST: the format of the book allows the reader total control over meta- and micro- information about cooking (and the nearly everything/anything else encompassed).<br /><br />1. Stories > Statistics<br />Our brains remember stories better than statistics. Tim's stories are entertaining and purposeful, and his examples are filled with memory tricks and mnemonics that assist in remembering/memorizing key information from each section.<br /><br />2. Micro &lt;---> Macro<br />His recipes include a full explanation/paragraph-style instructions for that hand-holding first time you attempt to cook one of them. They ALSO have a \\"quick reference\\" on the sidebar with ingredients/cooking temp/cooking time for when you're a master and just need a quick reminder of the essentials.<br /><br />3. Cheat-Sheets<br />My best professor would allow us to bring a \\"cheat sheet\\" of essential math formulas so that we could focus on solving problems without getting tangled in a rote memory error. This book has exactly this kind of information (cooking related) spread throughout. My personal favorite is a list of basic herb and spice \\"formulas\\" that create the fundamental flavors of specific cuisines worldwide.<br /><br />4. Training Programs<br />A good training book will have specialty exercises and workout routines for different sports and athletic skills (4-Hr body, for example). This book has them too, but they're for cooking (and cooking related skills). Tim has used this formula to break down skill sets (knife, survival, game hunting, cooking basics...) into mini-programs (with times and \\"workout days\\" even!) so that you can get up to speed with as little worry as possible.<br /><br />THE INTIMIDATINGEST:<br />Man-o-man, this is a huge book. But that's because its a lot of KINDS of books. It's a reference book that just happens to be worthy of bathtub and bed-time reading - small chunks or long stints, AND useful for surviving & thriving. Its size may intimidate hesitant readers, but if you can US Magazine, you can read this!!<br /><br />GEEK OUT: The very very very best part of this book is that it is not an encyclopedia of everything. It's a distillation of a lot of things. And Tim tells you what he's distilling, and where to GET MORE! You can save yourself the trouble of reading Harold McGee's \\"On Food and Cooking\\" (an awesome book on the history and chemistry of food). But, thanks to this book, you now KNOW IT EXISTS! And WHERE TO FIND IT! For the terminally curious, this isn't just a window into new worlds of information, it's a hitchhiker's guide for wherever you want to go next.<br /><br />(*The video is called Powers of Ten by Charles & Ray Eames)oks.

B007Q0OV6Q|5.0|Alright, the advent calendar costs as much as a Lego, Lego's are expensive, each Lego &#34;set&#34; is individually wrapped, etc.  I love it.
B008OOYALE|5.0|I found that this game was fun and entertaining. My three year old granddaughter enjoys watching me feed the dragons.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I didn't think I'd like the series of books but I started reading Hunger Games and although I know it's meant for a younger audience, I really did enjoy it; therefore I read t he sequels.  This sequel didn't disappoint.
0345803485|2.0|I was stoked when I heard Fifty Shades of Grey had been picked up for movie production. So much so, that I wrote an article about it on my web site. I then immediately, the same day of the news release went to my local grocery to buy the book. After I arrived, I eagerly tore the front cover back and started reading right there in the aisle. Couldn't believe my eyes...<br /><br />First, Fifty Shades of Grey is written in present tense and the narration is extremely pedestrian. I kept reading, but the more I read the less I wanted to read this book... and this is coming from a romance author and a die-hard romance fan who absolutely loves the genre and other romance authors. I even read Harlequin romances, including classic Harlequin releases from the 1980s. I wanted to like it.<br /><br />Can't figure out why someone wanted to turn this steaming pile of dung into a movie, except to say that screenplays are written in present tense so maybe it was just easier to adapt than other romance novels. And I thought my first book was bad.<br /><br />Needless to say, I didn't buy the book. The plot is fine, but the characters, the narration didn't pull me in. Christian Grey has the mannerisms, speech patterns, and lifestyle of a man much older than 26 years old. Maybe someone in his forties, late thirties - best. I understand this story was originally a fanfic of Twilight (bear in mind, loved Twilight when I read it), but Edward Cullen was technically much older, so his mannerisms and speaking patterns made sense and he was still, a seventeen year-old at heart.<br /><br />I wasn't buying the plot at all and I don't just mean at the grocery store.
B005LQ6UE8|5.0|A true story, very gripping.  It was hard to put this book down.  Written in a moving and intriguing style.

B0090SI42Y|3.0|The Man With the Iron Fists is a movie that was 'presented' (not produced) by Quentin Tarantino and directed by RZA. It centers on the story of a black blacksmith in China, who is trying to leave his hostile home village that's entrenched in between good ol' clan wars.<br /><br />If you are seeking to be entertained, look no further. RZA blends the 'hip-hop samurai' type of music and feel -- prevalent in a lot of anime in recent years -- with the Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon-floating-around-style of fighting to create a high-flying (no pun intended) and adventurous parody of the genres with a Spaguetti Western flare. Needless to say, visually this movie is great in many respects.<br /><br />However, beyond that, the movie suffers from more than a few noticeable stumbling points. The first being dialogue. Not only is the writing over-simplified, but the fact that some of the Chinese characters have Oriental-English accents while others speak perfectly clear English is something that will distract some viewers from the already simple plot. In addition, the main antagonist Silver Lion is portrayed as the funny one-liner villain, but there are times when his role feels overdone and out of place during the more serious scenes. Perhaps this harkens back to the older Kung-fu movie time other reviewers mentioned, but for me it was distracting.<br /><br />Another caveat is the characters. They didn't feel very memorable, which is again probably due to the dialogue. The exception here is Russel Crowe's character, who exhibits wit, style, and the fact he sticks out like a sore thumb in a charming way. While I feel he did an extraordinary job in executing this role, I'm not exactly sure how his career will be affected in the long-run from this... You'll know what I mean.<br /><br />Lastly, there were gaps in terms of the suspension of belief. While these types of movies are going to exhibit combat and visuals that are uncanny, a few of the developments toward the end, including one bad guy in particular, just felt like huge leaps of faith without any sort of explanation at all. I don't want to spoil anything, but again I think you'll know what I mean as you watch.<br /><br />Now before I sound overly critical, let me tip my hat off to RZA. Not only did he direct the movie. He wrote it, helped compose the soundtrack, and starred as the blacksmith. This truly is RZA's movie in every sense of the phrase.<br /><br />With so many responsibilities on one person, I can't help but critique this movie with admiration for it. It may not be on the Tarantino level, but if this is a beginning path for RZA I am excited to see what he comes up with next. Watch TMWTIF with the right expectations. If you're expecting Kill Bill or Pulp Fiction, take it down a good notch. If you're expecting a parody of exaggerated, oriental combat and hip-hop anime with Spaghuetti Western tropes, you're in for an entertaining ride. It's worth a watch, even if it doesn't etch itself into your soul.
B004R6JG7G|5.0|Awesome movie for me it is one of the all time best movies and now with it on Blu-ray the quality is excelent, if you like this movie you need to ad this one to your collection.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|One of the top five TV series in the last ten years.  Ranks right up there with THE SOPRANOS, BREAKING BAD, SIX FEET UNDER, and MAD MEN.  Addictive suspense.  Great acting.  For fans of quality suspense.
B005HE5J7I|5.0|I love the story lines and the helpful maps and genology chart.  I highly recomend it.  Good descriptions of real characters.

You won't be disappointed if you purchase this collection.<br /><br />Thank you, Mr. Howey, for allowing us to read this beautiful and poignant novel.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|The story continues and does not disappoint.  Skip the sex parts if you must, but there's enough romance and story here to still be a good read!  On to book 3....

0547884591|5.0|This is the 2nd book I've read by Tim Ferriss, my first experience was with \\"The 4-Hour Body.\\" I read through this book within a week and was utterly blown away by it. Not only does Mr. Ferriss teach you new recipes (some of which I've tried already and are wonderful), he uses his own personal experience in life to try and help you improve yours. Is final story in the book will make you think for days after reading it. And not to mention I was laughing almost immediately. Highly recommended for anyone looking for a way to improve any aspect of your life.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|Very good quality, solid price and and was mailed very quickly.  No issues with the blu rays yet but from what I've seen so far, very awesome!

034553154X|4.0|It is a good product, but I feel that it takes a little too much artistic licence, I think I would have liked to have a more &#34;realistic&#34; approach to the books.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|I can't get enough of his view of how things really are. I just enjoyed this adventure so much, it was a great ride.

B0083P1QUM|5.0|This story is keeping my favorite crime solver fresh. She does however need to focus more on the job at hand then on Benton.
B0043GN6XK|5.0|I'm no opera buff, and I suppose Baroque opera is one corner of the field that I have deliberately shied away from, well, the beginning. A while back, however, I happened to listen to Vivaldi's Bajazet and was immediately engaged. That led me to try this recording of Ercole, and I found myself not only engaged but entrapped as well. Everything comes together in this two-disc set -- the composition itself, the orchestra, chorus and soloists -- to form an almost perfect sonic storm of delight. Most of us laymen know Vivaldi only by his concertos; this album testifies to his more encompassing talent in other forms as well. A magnificent release, highly recommended.
B006IRQTWM|5.0|my favorite movie of all time - still can not watch it without crying.  In high school when it first came out.
B000001GXE|3.0|I have a different response to each of the performances on this disc. Other reviewers, one in particular, have analyzed these two Schubert renditions in far more detail and with much more musical understanding than I could ever aspire for, so let me contribute as a token layman, with accompanying ignorance. Kleiber's performance of the Symphony No. 3 I found perfectly acceptable. I'll agree that portions of it whiz by rather fast, but my attitude in such things is to wait and see if the difference can eventually be made to work or not. In this instance, I can go along with the quick paces -- it's different, but to me not especially unacceptable. Still, I will mention that I prefer to this performance of the No. 3 the versions conducted by Bruggen, Immerseel and Goodman -- all of which are by coincidence period instrument renditions. As for the recording of the Unfinished Symphony on this disc, I found it somewhat one-sided. The first movement certainly cast long dark shadows, rather in keeping with Kleiber's style on this disc, but the second movement seemed rather awkward, as if the conductor could not properly swivel his emotions to match the different outlook of the closing section. If we're talking about an alternate suggestion here, my choice is the vintage Klemperer account on EMI. Overall, I'd say these performances are okay -- if I could, I'd give the release 3.5 stars, but after some thought I've decided to aim on the low side on account of that second movement of the No. 8.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Love it!  All the extra info brings a smile to my face every time.  The 7-day forecast is so helpful and at the touch of a finger.  The lifestyle alerts are spot on.  Would recommend it to friends and family.
B000056NX5|5.0|I'm not going to argue over which was better, this version or the 1973 version. Each is great in its own way. What I like about this production is the energy in the singing and the obvious tension between Judas and Christ. There is much more direct interaction between the two main characters in this movie than the 1973 movie, and you get to see more of the turmoil in Judas' mind as he struggles with his disillusionment.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|Love It!  Superior to the regular Tunein Radio .  Easy to find and select new choices. I tend to use it before sleep with the timer.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Get aquainted with Facebook, learn how to protect yourself, and be ruthless with Friending.<br />Weed out non-useful people, and make more precious, relationships and &#34;pen-pals.  Friends<br />they put out great information.
0547884591|5.0|Tim once again cuts to the core points required for learn quickly and become skilled in more than just cooking. This book is HUGE, and covers quite a few areas, but keeps coming back to cooking as it's core theme, that's not to say that those who don't cook won't get much out of it, I fall in and out of love with cooking and I think this will give me a kick to try new things and think about cooking differently as he's cut to the core of what is important and discarded what is not at the same time as stripping away the pretentiousness that seems to prevail with most cookery authors. I highly recommend the four hour chef as I think most people can get something worth the (great value) price but especially for life hackers, minimalists and those who like to be self sufficient or continue to expand their skill sets.
0425263916|5.0|Great book! I couldn't put it done. It was sexy, suspenseful and original. I can't wait till may when the next book comes out.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I read this because it is so &#34;hot&#34; on the market.  Well written, however it is very &#34;raw&#34;, not to mention &#34;hot&#34;, no, burning.  I kept wondering why so many people were captivated by it. The  2nd and 3rd volumes create the characters and story.  I am glad I read it, but not proud that I did.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|I love the app but for some reason in the middle of the game the app closes.  very frustrating ..Pls correct

B002MQYOFW|5.0|i loved this book it was action packed and worth th price. so much better then twilight and other books like it although the movie director must not have even read this book for example  the mocking jay pin was totally different and at the end the execution was from being hung not berries but the book was awesome
B0063GORYU|4.0|i play this before going to bed in an effort to keep<br />my mind sharp.  i like it.  it can be achallenge.
B000AYEL1A|5.0|The story line is great, and so is the music.If you like Barbra, you should enjoy this.It really shows her range in music.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|What a wonderful book.  The plot is fantastic, the writing is delicious,  And the end is a question--which story do you believe?  By the way, the movie is true to the book.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|I loved the Iron Man movies and love this movie!  Sure, some of the dialogue is a bit cheesy, but it's a superhero flick; I pretty much expect that.  So it could be a bit better as far as dialogue goes, but I don't buy many movies and I purchased this one a few days after it came out on DVD.  Great movie!
B004DMIIVO|5.0|At first I thought it would lame but I am eating my word. A world where information is share, everyone with their own avatar. Something that can be enjoyible can also be something that can destory the world. Who would have thought that a network would create so much caos around the world which will bring a family and a young boy together. It is up to these few to unite and save the would.<br />  What I find enjoyible is that the near future we'll be able have a gaint server networking that connet everyone with there own avatar. Look at Xbox and Wii. We can make very avatar interact with each but the only problem is that there isn't a big enough server with the power to support the server and every avatar.
B0045XICB2|5.0|I love the tension between the characters, their acting is very compelling.  This is truly one of the great love stories on film.
0763644765|5.0|I GOT THIS FOR MY DAUGHTER WHO IS 18 MONTHS AND SHE LOVES IT! SHE IS ALWAYS BRINGING IT TO MOMMY TO READ HER AND SHE HAS BECOME MORE INTERESTED IN THE POTTY NOW. GREAT BOOK!
B00AH8VU0Y|5.0|This is a great show. Good special effects but more important, it has an interesting and intensifying plot. The cast also changes randomly to keep it from getting stale.
B001NERPHS|5.0|I can't believe I've waited this many years to add this CD to my Dylan/The Band collection.  It really rocks!  Some amazing tunes that never saw the light of day for some reason, and the genesis of some truly great songs, which you'll recognize.  You've gotta get it if you want to consider your Dylan collection even close to complete.
B00AA7O22U|3.0|Hey, it is a dumb blood and guts movie.  A way to kill time.  Lots of stuff that did not make sense.

B008AK8FHM|1.0|I was very disappointed in this book. I downloaded the sample,and from that I thought it would be a good book. I found the book very new age,and not scriptural.I'm sorry I wasted my money on this book,very disappointing.

0394716787|5.0|I choose this rating because this is exactally what I was looking for. I am sure that my son will love this book and keep it for years to come.
B007MUQGKO|5.0|love it, this is the exact same doll as the normal skull shores doll but black and white; they make a batch during production on friday 13th. the normal Frankie is greenish and the suite is green and I think the lips are also or they are black. Anyway they are slight changes, and my daughter will flip Christmas morning when she opens it... I would however like to note that the doll was $9 and change when I bought it over a month ago, but it pays to do Christmas shopping early :D
B000FCKGPC|5.0|Have thoroughly enjoyed the entire series so far.  There are a lot of charactors to keep track of, as well as Houses, and the geography of the 7 Kingdoms, but it is well worth it for the scifi/fantasy fan.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|Love it!  Susan is great.  Music quality is great.  Her voice is amazing.  I have all her albums.  Great buy.
B009VB97EY|4.0|I am not going to lie.  It is a little cheesy but great eye candy - even my husband watched it.

B0051UP5NQ|5.0|I highly recommend this software to anyone that may ask.  It does so much more then it suggests in the description
B001NLL93W|4.0|I couldn't put this book down. I really enjoyed this book and the series as a whole. ****Spoiler**** I struggled with the book when it was revealed that Clary and Jace are siblings. The reader is given hints that this is not true but you don't find out until the very end for sure and there are still situations between the two that are tense because of the way they feel for each other and tease for the reader because you just want to say to them, &#34;stop it, stop. That's your brother/sister&#34;
0064471837|4.0|\\"The worldbuilding in this book is absolutely amazing.\\"<br /><br />So said my friend and reading companion, and I find that I have to agree. Sabriel is a book that strikes one speechless with the sheer scope of it, the sheer uniqueness that it embodies. No more standard fantasy-fare. Oh, it does adhere to a quest-type structure; it follows the story of a girl on a journey - first to find her father, and then to prevent the unleashing of a great evil. But here is where the book utterly trashes conventionality.<br /><br />We go back to the worldbuilding. Garth Nix has a talent for this, for the setting of this world is unusual, to say the least. The Old Kingdom is a world full of magical peril, full of Dead beings that won't stay dead, and connected to a world of technology through a \\"Wall\\". Of course this causes problems. The heroine Sabriel finds herself the inheritor of an ancient legacy - as the Abhorsen, her task is to keep down the Dead, and to make sure they pass to the afterlife.<br />Of course, there are walking Dead aplenty. It makes for some very interesting scenes.<br /><br />The heroine herself is a conundrum. The word best used to describe her is \\"sassy\\", and yet she is much more than that, more than the sum of her parts. She is courageous, strong-willed and stubborn, but throughout the book one can see through that shell to her naivety, her weakness - she arrives in the Old Kingdom thinking she knows everything, but instead realizes the true limits of her knowledge, and the dangers all about her. The Old Kingdom is not tame. This fragility is what truly characterizes her, and makes her more than just words on a page. There are others of note, as well (such as Mogget, the adorably snarky cat!thing, and Touchstone, well...) but Sabriel stands out to me, especially, as powerful and well-rendered as she is.<br /><br />This book starts slow, but picks up speed a little way in, and soon the reader is drawn relentlessly into the story - and what a story it is! Full of darkness and horror, a sense of danger that cuts to the quick, even romance that subtly springs where the reader least expects it - it is a masterpiece in itself, moved by the machinations of such well-rendered characters. I will admit that it does lag in places, but as a whole Sabriel is well-written, and very well crafted.<br />As for myself... I have read quite a lot of books, yet Sabriel and its sequels remain at the tip of the iceberg, and nothing can seem to knock them from the pedestal. I've been in love with this series for approximately six years, and whatever happens, it will still inhabit its own little niche in my heart.<br /><br />\\"Does the walker choose the path, or the path the walker?\\"<br /> Full of darkness and horror, a sense of danger that cuts to the quick, even romance that subtly springs where the reader least expects it - it is a masterpiece in itself, moved by the machinations of such well-rendered characters.
