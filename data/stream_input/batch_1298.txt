B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game. I love the challage. I cant wait to open up more games just to see if I can beat the task.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is very fun. I kinds wish the locked games were a little cheaper. Some of the mini game are very addicting. This is an amazing game for free
B004K8WPUQ|5.0|Just received the Rode VideoMic Pro for my Canon 60d and have to say I'm VERY PLEASED!! The sound quality is significantly better than the internal mic built within the camera and makes a very noticeable difference. Make sure you set the audio recording option to manual inside of camera and decrease the input gain until you reach a desirable mic level. Also, it's a shotgun mic so the mic HAS TO BE POINTED @ SUBJECT to achieve best results. Another great thing is that it comes with a 10yr warranty after you register it thru Rode. What's 10min compared to 10yrs of protection on your investment. I highly recommend for the cost and I'm sure there will be no disappointments.

B0054JZC6E|5.0|For free you cant go wrong. I just started playing it and I've only scratched the surface.... so many different styles of games to play. With such variety you're bound to come across games that are right up you're alley. I highly recommend this app!
B005HSL626|1.0|I \\"purchased\\" this app for my kindle the week of Christmas when it was the free app of the day. Not sure if there is any difference between the app I downloaded and the regularly free app, but one thing is for certain: it's terrible! I played the game and it just wasn't for me, so there probably really isn't anything wrong with the game per se. But I noticed that Halfbrick.com kept opening up in my Kindle web browser. I wasn't clicking anything nor opening that web page, so I figured it must be from the app. Since it wasn't my type of game & the web page thing was annoying, I uninstalled the game. That was about a week ago and Halfbrick.com is STILL opening up in my web browser! (and I have no other Halfbrick games) I have tried searching on the internet to find out how to remove it, but have had no luck. If anyone else has been able to successfully remove this spyware from their Kindle, I would love to hear from you! In the mean time, I am giving this game 1 star because of this annoying feature.
0312641893|4.0|Cinder is a fast paced fun ride of a book. I absolutely loved the premise - a cyborg Cinderella? How fabulous! It was fresh, unique, and original compared to all the stories that have been coming out recently. And the futuristic setting? New Beijing? How awesome! I was totally hooked.<br /><br />Except while I loved the whole scope of the idea, some things never came into fruition quite as clearly as I hoped. The world building was scant to say the least. I get that it's in the future, set in China, but what else? There really isn't much delving into what the world looks like aside from the bare technical details of evolved technologies, and maybe the whole hierarchy deals.<br /><br />But there was something intrinsically missing. How did this world function? How did the economy function as a whole? How did it affect class distinctions that are so obviously present in the book? I mean, we know it's a monarchical society and there is some present racism against manufactured humans - cyborgs, but how did the rest of the people live? What was their language like? I don't know if you know this but the -jie tag to someone's name in Mandarin (maybe it works for Cantonese) is usually how someone refers to an older sister but also as a respectful address for a woman older than you. It's the same deal in Japanese or Korean with their corresponding affixes. Also, how did all these countries or whatnot shape up to be the way they are? Why is New Beijing so special? Yeah, I don't know either.<br /><br />I liked Cinder. She's fun, resourceful, doesn't really become some weak, sappy protagonist at the thought of her love interest. She doesn't mope around and wait for him - she has a means of making her own money and doesn't shy away from it, but I don't know. I really wanted some more in depth introspection from her. More of the am I really human or not? kind of thing. Just more, you know, meaningful thought processes from her to make her a more rounded character and give her some depth. I don't know why her name is Linh though. Linh is a Vietnamese name. Kinda clashes with the Chinese. I'm not sure if she's trying to say that ALL the Asians are mixed up in this place or if she just found a nice sounding name and went \\"Hey, let's use it!\\" And for that matter, what IS the overriding language in this place anyway? I would assume it's Chinese but how did that work out?<br /><br />The prince was all right. He's noble, nice, doesn't harbor prejudices against people and sees them for what they are first before he judges. But he's just so... perfect? I mean, he's kind of boring in that he's always a sweet guy and there aren't really any so called flaws to him other than him clinging too fiercely to his morals and being too young for his crown. I guess I should applaud him for not being the whole abusive male that I find so frequently.<br /><br />I'm actually quite familiar with Marissa Meyer's writing, as I read her Sailor Moon fanfiction when she posted them up. They were innovative, had excellent plots, and were great works of imagination. Her stories were one of the top reviewed pieces in that section and were probably one of the best.<br /><br />So it made me wrinkle my nose a bit when I got to certain aspects of this story. Princess Selene ** spoiler ** or Cinder ** end spoiler **, the long missing princess of Lunar, shares quite a lot of similarities with Sailor Moon. The Princess of the Moon was called, Princess Serenity, and her counterpart on Earth was called Serena (in the English dub). Very similar to Selene, no? Also the whole idea of there being some race of aliens from the moon who are powerful, reminds me of the Sailor Scouts (soldiers) and their other planetary magic. It may be an ooh fun moment for her already established fanbase, but to me, it feels like she relied a bit too heavily from the original source material. Prince Kaito reminds me a lot of Darien, or Prince Endymion on his other form.<br /><br />A lot of this book feltlike one large set up for her other books in her series. Especially during the middle where nothing essentially happens and it just drags and drags. Thankfully things picked up shortly thereafter but I'm not going to forgive it that easily.<br /><br />Another problem is that everything is just so very predictable. I could figure out what was going to happen, what the big plot twists and unveils were by the time I reached the halfway mark of the book. I mean, sure, it's fun to have your thoughts validated but it's also kinda boring because it takes the starch right out of the story.<br /><br />I also am not the greatest fan of the deliberate cliffhanger at the end. Overall, this is a fun romp that's not too deep on meaning. You'll enjoy it but I'm not sure if you'll remember it.ally during the middle where nothing essentially happens and it just drags and drags.

0385534639|2.0|Interesting and creative read.Didn't like the jumpy timelines. The mystery and fairy tale aspect is too drawn out.That took the fun out of the mystery for me. I thought the character development was lacking. For me it was like watching magic, always \\"looking for the trick\\" and not enjoying the performance.My grandparents were magicians so I am happy that magicians may be the next hot thing in books. For me this book wasn't it.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game and the points system keeps me interested because I am curious to see the new games I love playing on my kindle fire and it also keeps my kids interested and its easy enough for them
B005I6EU7U|5.0|This cover is exactly what I wanted.  I was a little unsure buying it for my Kindle Touch since it is shown as being for the Fire, but the Touch fits perfectly, nice and snug.  The cover is solid and appears to be well made, feeling just like an actual old  book.  I have had no issue with it staying open since I just folded it back to loosen the spine a bit.  Very happy with my choice.
B005I6EU48|2.0|How should I put this?<br /><br />I love this cover. It really dresses up a Kindle (Fire), and I loved it on sight--which is why bought it as a gift for my little sister. Unfortunately for me, that makes this next bit even harder to bear.<br />The cover shipped in 2 days. Great! Wonderful.<br />It was packaged decently (We bought used, so that doesn't always happen.)<br />It looks great! Good color, good fit... Except this little detail:<br />It was IRREVOCABLY DAMAGED<br />  Now, say what you will about buying used, but I've never had a problem before. ALSO, I purchased through Amazon's own merchant, Warehouse Deals, Inc. The back cover of the \\"book\\" was bent in two places, wrinkling the faux-leather, and one of the securing straps (bottom right) was ripped right out. I'm returning it asap, and frankly, I'm offended.<br /><br />Great product, Amazon. But next time, make sure what you're shipping is a quality product; this thing isn't even fixable!<br /><br />To all you prospective buyers, the product itself is the only reason my review has any stars at all. It really is great, just DONT buy used, and especially not from Amazon's Warehouse Deals! Just in case what happened to me happens to you, I'd bite the bullet and get it brand new.
B004J4WKUQ|4.0|As a 37 year old guy who has been a gamer for nearly 30 years I was told I needed to read this book. So I did and really enjoyed it. If you grew up in the 80s you'll really enjoy the references (TV shows, video games, movies, etc.), but honestly they do grow old after awhile. It almost seems like he's trying too hard to squeeze so many in. Thankfully the stuffing of 80s references backs off as the story gets going. And once it got going I couldn't put it down.<br /><br />Now I'm not a big fan of Young Adult Fiction, and while I would have a hard time classifying this as such (far too many f-words and inappropriate content for your typical YA fiction novel), with main characters that are mostly teenagers you have to navigate some of the irritating teenage lingo, as well as the cheesy descriptions of a teenage boy \\"falling in love\\". It's rather distracting for me. Most probably won't care, but I kept wanting the story to move on.<br /><br />Despite an early and quite extensive rant against religion (which made a little sense in context of the story but was otherwise pointless), and a few mentions of global warming (just annoying), I really enjoyed the story a lot. While these things annoyed me the story kept me reading. I can overlook annoying dialogue if the story is engaging. And in Ready Player One it is. Once it got going it was very fast paced with only a few slow moments. The end was satisfying and I was actually wishing it was part of a series (preferably with the characters a bit more grown up).<br /><br />Whether the author intended it or not, it seems like a commentary on how dependent we are on digital media and entertainment and how so many people seem to prefer living in a virtual world (or in social media where they can be whatever they want) than in the real world, interacting with people face to face.<br /><br />So some annoyances aside (mainly the occasionally annoying dialogue), it's a really fun read. Any fan of 80s pop culture, movies, video games and TV should really enjoy it.and TV should really enjoy it.
B000ICXQHE|3.0|Inside Man starts off as a pretty intriguing bank heist action flick. We have the hostages (a pretty normal hostage crowd) and the robbers (smart, efficient, handsome under their masks) and the cops (name brand actors playing tough and swearing police officers). The normal negotiations and threats and police shenanigans ensue, after which a twist is introduced - there is another negotiator (Jodie Foster) whose role is vaguely explained. And there's something to do with Nazis and tainted wealth. Christopher Plummer is on the scene as the \\"bank owner with secrets\\". And this is where everything dissolves for me, the viewer. Inside man had a really engaging set-up, some very well-written side stories and a fizzled-out \\"meh\\" of a climax. I didn't realize we weren't supposed to know what Clive Owen did to escape detection, so I didn't know the movie was going to end (I was still waiting for the surprise). We never did find out who Owen actually was, how he knew what was in the bank or what axe he had to grind with Plummer. There was very little explanation for all the lead-up. His chemistry with Denzel was non-existent. His acting, however, was awesome. Overall I was happy to watch the first 90 minutes of a great movie and disappointed with the lackluster nothing of the last 30. Left you with the impression that the writers simply stopped writing after the exciting parts and the actors kind of walked off stage without explanation. The music made you think it was a \\"usual suspects\\" ending so I had to rewatch to make sure I didn't miss anything. Nope. Just a weak finish.
B005XN31LY|5.0|I Really love this show! It's visually stunning and the story is great! I do have to admit a little disblelief about the idea of a birth mother becoming so involved in the life of the child she gave up, but I am hoping that this becomes less unbelievable as the series continues. I am not dropping the rating because of it because the writing is great, the cast is great and the story is just too much fun! I can suspend my disbelief for this one.
B0063IH60K|5.0|A great free Solitare game. It has a little ad image that comes on with startup but you can just \\"x\\" it out, so I don't think it hurts the use of the app at all.
B003VDZWAQ|1.0|I am floored by the good reviews this show has gotten on here. I kept watching, hoping it would improve, but it doesn't. There is zero investment in these characters. There is no emotion and no one in this \\"troubled\\" town seems to care. The story lines are formulaic: someone's stress level gets too high and their \\"troubled\\" nature comes out, unintentionally hurting/killing other people in town. Comparisons to X-Files are laughable. This show is terrible. Everyone has different tastes of course, so you might like it, but to give you an idea of my taste in TV, I am an X-Files fan and I also enjoy Grimm, Once Upon A Time, The Mentalist and the earlier seasons of Criminal Minds.
B002ZG981E|5.0|[This review refers to the 2-disc Blu-Ray Edition]  My copy came with three discs: 1 Blu-Ray feature, 1 Blu-Ray Special Features, and 1 DVD with 'Inception' written on it.  I'll need to take a look at what's on the disc, but there is no documentation or mention of a 3rd disc on the packaging.  Maybe it's a bonus!
B005ZUR724|5.0|I downloaded this app onto my Kindle Fire and I'm not having any issues with it being unplayable.  So ignore all those reviews saying it doesn't work on Kindle Fire.  There must have been a bad version, but it's been fixed.  Anyway, this game is pretty fun, especially if you like World of Warcraft.  One warning, though.  The game requires an in-app purchase to start playing it.  So it will cost you at least a dollar more than what you bought the app for.  But considering it's an online MMO for a dollar a month, I think it's a small price to pay.
B004ECDNJU|4.0|Game was easy to pick up on and easy to alter for your choice of difficulty. Nice puzzle/concentration game that was challenging enough to perfect each level, but not impossible. Only complaint is there are only 26 levels and it goes so fast that 26 isn't enough.
B0054JZC6E|1.0|It's ok. It is fun for the first couple but then it starts to get boring. The controls a poor to and there are lots of add. I would say don't get it.
0307593312|5.0|When I started this over 1000 page tome, I wasn't too sure where I was headed...but it turned out to the most marvelous place. Author Haruki Murakami has an amazing way with language and characters....and you're hooked by the first(of many)chapters. When Aomame enters a taxi, you're on the journey with her, and after she exits the taxi...you know this isn't an everyday story. Without spoiling anything, the twists and turns in this novel are spell casting. I couldn't wait to see what happened every night when I read.  I don't think you'll be disappointed.
0446585025|3.0|I'm a huge fan of Ellen and watch her show as much as I can, so I was really excited to read her book! I haven't read any of her other books, so maybe I wasn't prepared for the way she writes (lots of jokes, obviously, but also a whole chapter goes by where she's said about a sentence of something I didn't already know), but I guess I was just a little disappointed. The book isn't very long, and she might tell you one thing about herself in each chapter (or one NEW thing) and also say something like \\"we should all be nice to each other\\", which is a great message, but at the end of the book I just felt like that wasn't really worth the money. Kind of like id just paid $15 for an extended monologue of one of her shows. Sorry Ellen, but it might be because I'm such a huge fan that I wasn't very impressed- I wanted MORE and after watching so many seasons of her show, I know she could have given more opinions and thoughts and depth than what I got in this book- mostly fluff. Maybe she didn't want to alienate anyone, and appeal to all audiences, but we all already love her if were reading the book, so I think she would have been safe giving us a little more info about her real thoughts and feelings!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|really fun.filled with tons of different games for every sort of person and every sort of mood. all in all a wonderful app.
0743289692|5.0|A SPOILER ALERT IS NOT NEEDED.  THIS IS A REVIEW, NOT A SYNOPSIS.<br /><br />If your reading gravitates to books about foreign cultures* and overcoming obstacles, then you will enjoy Infidel.  Ayaan Hirsi Ali takes us on her journey--both physical and personal, as she relates her early life in Somalia, eventually escaping to the Netherlands.  She was raised as a Muslim but, forsook her religion when world events clashed with her beliefs.  Her story is one of subjugation and cruelties.  It depicts male domination of females in the name of Islam.<br /><br />Hirsi Ali tells the spellbinding tale of her childhood and the horrors she and other girls must endure.  The reader is not left with a sense of pity, but rather, one of elation.  She is a strong woman.  She has used her freedom to show the world the injustices of her culture.  It is not enough for her to have gained her own autonomy.  Most significant, Hirsi Ali actively fights for the emancipation of all women and champions the causes of liberation of all peoples.<br /><br />*Suggested reading:<br />Deborah Feldman's new book, Unorthodox:  The Scandalous Rejection of my Hasidic Roots  http://www.amazon.com/Unorthodox-Scandalous-Rejection-Hasidic-Roots/dp/1439187002/ref=cm_cr-mr-title  (see review:  Unabashedly Honest, January 1, 2012<br /><br />Mosab Hassan Yousef's Son of Hamas  http://www.amazon.com/Son-of-Hamas-ebook/dp/B004QOAQ7I/ref=cm_cr-mr-title  (see review:  Even-Handed Point of View, December 11, 2011)<br /><br />Souad's Burned Alive:  A Survivor of an \\"Honor Killing\\" Speaks Out  http://www.amazon.com/Burned-Alive-Survivor-Killing Speaks/dp/0446694878/ref=cm_aya_orig_subj  (see review:  Horrifyingly True, July 18, 2010)<br /><br />Isabel Allende's Island Beneath the Sea  http://www.amazon.com/Island-Beneath-Sea-Isabel-Allende/dp/0061988243/ref=cm_cr-mr-title (see review:  Better Than TV Soaps and Novelas, June 9, 2010)<br /><br />Azar Nafisi's two books:  Things I've Been Silent About:  Memories of a Prodigal Daughter http://www.amazon.com/Reading-Lolita-Tehran-Memoir-Books/dp/0812979303/ref=sr_1_3?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1325767818&sr=1-3  (see review:  Every Family Has a Story, January 4, 2012) and Reading Lolita in Tehran:  A Memoir in Books<br />http://www.amazon.com/Reading-Lolita-Tehran-Memoir-ebook/dp/B000FC0XY6/ref=dp_kinw_strp_1?ie=UTF8&m=AG56TWVU5XWC2<br />(see review:  Repression, Literature, and Women, January 5, 2012)p/0812979303/ref=sr_1_3?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1325767818&sr=1-3  (see review:  Every Family Has a Story, January 4, 2012) and Reading Lolita in Tehran:  A Memoir in Books    http://www.amazon.com/Reading-Lolita-Tehran-Memoir-ebook/dp/B000FC0XY6/ref=dp_kinw_strp_1?ie=UTF8&m=AG56TWVU5XWC2    (see review:  Repression, Literature, and Women, January 5, 2012)

B000BDLJBU|5.0|One bit of advice, the red wire goes to the tip, blue  to the ring.  Easy to solder.  Wire seems secure with no tension on the solder points.  Great way to repair expensive ear buds.  No static.
B005I64U66|5.0|This movie can be easily enjoyed by anybody who has worked for a bad boss. The plot was somewhat predicatble but enjoyable none the less.
0756405890|5.0|I first read Patrick Rothfuss short story \\"The Road to Levinshir\\" in Writers of tne Future volume 18, which as it turns out, was pulled from The Name of the Wind and was what got him recognized enough to be able to sell his book. Thank goodness!  I really enjoy good epic fantasy story telling and this book ranks up with Tolkein's Lord of the Rings and Andre Norton's Witchworld Series in my estimation.
B004EPZ06Q|5.0|I liked Hangover part 1 a little bit more but this was a worthy follow up.  I especially like mr chow and his drug dealing monkey. I heard that there might be a part 3 and I hope there will be.
B000AQJPQE|3.0|Overall I think this is an easy project to teach about the Solar System.  There were a few suprises though.  Some minor construction is required to hang the sun.  You have to drill holes in the ceiling in order to hang the prodcut.  This was not an issue for me but may be for some.  Otherwise the product went together nice and easy and is now hanging in my child's room.  It has spawned conversations about how fast the planets rotate and how long days, months and years are on other planets compared to earths'.  One other note, it chews through batteries pretty fast while spinning.  They are easy to change though.  It is fragile and not for young children.  However 9+ and interested in space is a great age for this product.  I would reccomend it!  Enjoy!
B005HIEFC4|4.0|The characters are likable, the story is believable, I enjoyed the flash mom scenes very much (even though they seemed a bit implausible)
B005HSL626|3.0|I'he tried to install this game a few times, but I can't seem to. But I played it on my friend's kindle fire and it was tons of fun.
B001PB3RU8|5.0|Great album, good buy. I have listened to it on repeat ever since I put it in my CD player.
B001ILFUDC|5.0|The family sat around the TV, popped popcorn, everyone snuggled up to one another, wish upon that star and enjoyed a childhood classic.

B0043URV5U|5.0|My husband and I are big fans of Bob Seger.  This 2-disc ultimate hits CD does not disappoint.  I have other Seger greatest hits, but this one gives you songs that usually are not included.  Glad I purchased this one!
B000P0J09W|5.0|Hard to find old movie that our grand kids love to watch. Plays perfect, like new condition and plays great.
B005H0IW6W|5.0|Michael's music is ageless! I gave this CD as Christmas presents to my 42 year old stepdaughter and my 15 year old niece.  They both loved it! P.S. I bought one for myself, too! Good mix of Christmas songs sung by a great singer, what more could you ask for?
031617615X|1.0|This book was very disappointing at so many levels.  Book two and three had been a horrible read for me, but I convinced myself to read the final book hoping that it would finally tie everything together and the high hopes and interest sparked in the very first book would return.  Sadly, it didn't.  Breaking Dawn turned out to be...well, very weird.  It seemed like the plot was going one direction, yes boring, not well written and uneventful and immature.  But then, in the last book, it turned into something else, completely out of line with the rest, and was very bizarre.  SPOILERS AHEAD:  1) The wedding. I was never hyped about this event.  Bella never wanted to get married and for that I wanted to slap her.  She loved Edward more than her own life, ached to be with him in the most sickening way, and wanted to sleep with him.  But not get married.  Wow...nice show of love there, Bella.  So I had hope that the wedding event would change her mind, would warm her heart and impress on her that it was truly the right thing to do.  Nope, the wedding was just a social event that she felt she had to do, wished she could skip, and then move on.  The whole wedding chapter was uneventful.  Poor description of it, which reflects much of Meyer's writing overall.  Bella is, of course, beautiful.  But how?  Is her hair up or down?  How does her dress look like?  I have no clue.  I guess it's not important for us to know, since it isn't that important for Bella to get married.  2) The sex scene.  I actually found myself laughing at how absurd the sex was.  Edward throws a hissy fit, his usual childish behavior, and tried to basically cut her off from it for the rest of the honeymoon! Um....ok.  Bella is totally cool with the marks and bruises.  What's the big deal?!  She got some and that's all that matters.  Again...weird.  3) The pregnancy.  So now, she finds out she is knocked up.  Within days.  Super special vampire sperm makes her pregnancy immediate and super advanced.  I don't find it that endearing.  What's the reaction from both of the teens?  Edward is upset and wants to get rid of it.  Bella suddenly turns out motherly.  Which would've been ok if she hadn't been such a selfish, whiney baby through the entire series.  Now, out of nowhere, a vampire growing inside of her who is knocking the heck out of her, is cute and cuddly.  The flaw with Meyer's narrative here is that she doesn't give her characters any dimension, as I've said about her writing in the past.  You have to have a good balance of flaw and appeal to a character.  Bella's character has always been flawed and flat, although everyone else unrealistically loves her.  The ONE TIME she should've been more flawed and gotten away with it, should've been about the pregnancy.  But instead, she is totally fine with this monster baby growing in her.  No hint of fear, nerves, anger...NOTHING.  4) Jacob has always been the only character in Twilight who had a smidge of dimension.  Not that he was that great--but still, he was more balanced and realistic.  In Breaking Dawn, Jacob is pretty much a window filler.  He is used by Bella and Edward constantly, and he is fine with it and stick by it.  Bella has no desire for him anymore and loves him as a brother.  Kind of a letdown about a huge climax we initially had between these two characters.  It's sad and pathetic that Jacob is used primarily as a guard dog and Bella's personal heater.  It really turns weird when Edward asks Jacob to have a baby with Bella.  I mean, what the heck is wrong with these people???  5) Imprinting on Renesmee.  Did I even spell it right?!  The name is HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!!  So, Jacob imprints on BELLA's baby. EW!  So basically, for the rest of the book he becomes a live-in nanny! How disappointing.  6) Volturi Drama.  I'll make it short: Boring and a let down.
0439023513|3.0|I really liked the action sequences towards the end of the novel but the slow start to the novel prevents total immersion into this roller coaster of an adventure. Also the plot twists towards the end and the inner turmoils Katniss endures were both interesting and believable.
034552554X|4.0|It's been a while since I read a book that made me love the characters as much as this one did.  I have my own children who briefly lived in the foster care system, and while their experiences were wildly different, the fears and attachment concerns of Victoria live in my home in a very real way.  Victoria is strangely appealing - a contradiction of aggression and fear.  My admiration for her grew through the course of the story - even in the face of the wrong choices that she makes.  The only thing that niggled at me was the fact that Victoria was so self-aware of her sabotaging behavior.  Many kids with poor attachment skills aren't very rational about the things they do.  However, as the story went along, I began to see Victoria as less a representative child and more an individual and I was able to believe that part of her story a little more.  This is a story I will want to read again.
B004EPZ084|5.0|Really fast delivery, no problems, item appeared as stated on listing. Could not have asked for any more, I would definitely use this vendor again.
B000002OOY|2.0|I had ordered this as a gift to a very good friend of mine... we are very very into soundtracks from movies and its something special from me to him.. only to find that the packaging was very weak. My cd case came home cracked... and we are very careful with our items.. I was really upset.
B004SUWR2C|5.0|I don't understand the other negative reviews either.  This game plays beautifully on my Kindle Fire.  Lots of fun!  Highly recommended!
0307593312|5.0|I can't explain how much I love this book. When I ordered it, I glanced at the reviews (I wasn't concerned about liking the book--I love Murakami and expected great things from him) and came across an unfortunate review that stated the book was, somehow, too repetitive. I found that this tainted my reading of 1Q48 a bit, but not so much that I didn't tear through the mammoth work in just a month. I read relatively slowly, so roughly 1000 pages in a month is great speed for me--which, in and of itself is a testament to the superb quality of Murakami's writing. Regardless, the issue of 1Q48 being repetitive can, I believe, be attributed almost completely to the fact that it was released in three different books over a long period of time in Japan. Certain basics of plot, characters, and details need to be repeated at least somewhat in order to let new readers understand. I don't imagine the book would be very good if you skipped book 1 or 2, but nonetheless..  In short, I have read almost all of Haruki Murakami's translated works, and 1Q84 is a wonderful addition, truly deserving of the hype and attention it got. As I rolled into the last 100 pages, though, my main concern was simply this: what am I going to read that is THIS good after I get done with 1Q84? I guess I could re-read the Wind-Up Bird Chronicles!   If you are a Murakami fan, this book will live up to every expectation you have of the man. He is a modern literary giant and genius supreme. As always, I find Murakami to be straddling the borders between something like pulp fiction and something like timeless literature (exactly what we need in our world today, I think), and this book definitely takes us that direction. Moreover, it is an interesting look at Japan in 1984, and the temporal and cultural details are an enjoyable trip to the near-past in a country many of us don't have first hand experience in or about that time. A brilliant novel, enough to keep the most avid reader of fantastic realism involved for, well, a long time! It's huge! But don't be discouraged if you're a first time reader. It's well worth it. If you are interested in a, perhaps, SMALLER Murakami masterpiece to start with, I highly recommend \\"Wild Sheep Chase.\\"   On a more technical note, I found a few strange discrepancies in the work's translations that I'm not sure if they were intentional or not. It's not really a big issue, but some words will be translated in one book, and then given to us in romanized Japanese the next! \\"Barley Head\\" the bar is often later referred to as \\"Mugiatama,\\" which I doubt the average English-speaking reader would get. Intentional? I don't know.  When's his next book coming out? I'm gonna need another fix soon!
B005UPOAT2|3.0|I'll leave the review of the movie to others, but I forgot this was a Lionsgate release and they did what they usually do - they very slightly zoom into the image, resulting in a full screen 16:9 (1.78:1) aspect ratio for what was in theaters a 1.85:1 release.  While for most this will be no big deal, if you're looking carefully you CAN see a difference between this and the older letterboxed DVD.  A nit to be sure, but not one that needs to be there, especially when the 2002 Miramax release got it right.  [[ASIN:B00003CY6M Serendipity (2002 DVD)]]
B003OCWF6I|5.0|This movie has a ton of action, great explosions, and all your other typical action movie stuff, but it also has a nice twist of comic relief mixed in. If you like action movies that aren't too over the top or unrealistic give this one a try.It's good enough that you'd wanna watch it more than once.
B004UXUUDA|5.0|In mid 1942 the French - doubtless under pressure from the Germans - arrested thousands of Jews in the Vel' d'Hiv Roundup and sent them to a huge camp - the Velodrome - preparatory to being sent to concentration camps. The movie begins with Sarah Starzynski's family being rounded up. She locks her little brother in a closet and tells him to be quiet. And then, when she learns that they are not going back she becomes frantic with worry and tries desperately to come back and rescue him.<br /><br />The movie moves on two tracks. In one, we see the travails of Sarah, her attempts to get back and rescue her little brother and what happens to her subsequently.<br /><br />In the other Julia, a reporter played by Kristin Scott Thomas, discovers that her husband's grandfather took over a beautiful apartment in Paris that was once owned by a Jewish family sent to the camps. That family was Sarah's. Julis, driven by a curiosity that does not let her be, digs really deep to find out what happened to Sarah. This quest ruins her marriage and causes other upsets in her life.<br /><br />Eventually the two threads do meet in a most unexpected way but I will not spoil it for you by saying how.<br /><br />The acting and directing are both memorable and you get a real feel for what it was like to be under Nazi control if you were a Jew. There are many poignant moments such as when Sarah recognizes one of the guards at the Velodrome as a neighboring youth she knew and tries to shake his hand with a quivering introduction.<br /><br />See this movie. It deals with a gruesome time in history but there is warmth and compassion in it as well. Certainly gripping till the very end.
B00005JKBC|3.0|Robert Redford and Brad Pitt are working for the CIA and are also good friends. We never see them together on stage, except through the use of flashbacks. Eventually the flashbacks tell the story, told as \\"slices of life\\", as opposed to a plotted theme.<br /><br />Brad Pitt is captured by the Chinese, tortured, and sent to the same prison where his girl friend was jailed. Robert Redford knows he has only 24 hours to make a deal with his captors, but the political conditions in Washington favor doing nothing. So, Redford takes the initiative and personally arranges for his freedom.<br /><br />After all was said and done, I think that Pitt allowed himself to be captured to be with his girl friend and knew that his very good friend Redford would find a way to get them out.
B001E5CH0G|4.0|I am definitely not a fan of Will Ferrell but I went ahead and bought this movie based on the reviews.  I was pleasantly surprised that I actually liked the movie.  It was cute and charming with a fair amount of pretty funny scenes. You have to laugh at the silliness of it all but overall, good holiday fun.
B003Y5H5FG|3.0|Formula part:   Yes, another vampire movie vying with zombies, aliens, and werewolves as cash cows for studios with props and/or CGI of any quality - doesn't matter because audience tastes run in the Pizza anything, Taco anything, Burger anything, Sub anything acceptance mode. More teen lovers fighting the evil one and his minions. A few years ago some CGI company came up with the CGI effect of burning some evil thing by turning them into glowing ashes and has been used by studios many times since. Evil thingies with piranha teeth has been a hot prop the past few years but is also getting a bit old.   Creative part:  There were enough twists to the story in terms of who our lead vamp was; who was bitten; the search for the teen vamp hunter's helper and the tools acquired to accomplish the fait accompli. OK, the burning ashes CGI, although overused, worked in this case. And OK, in this case the piranha green screen teeth were rather tasty. They even have a person that specializes in only that effect.   Basics:   Decent acting, directing, editing, setting and props.
B0008ENICU|2.0|I love old movies but I found this one to be particularly annoying.  It was extremely long and slow-paced and I found most of the dialog to be rather agitating. I've seen other old movies like this so I know that it was just the style of movies made back then but I can't stand to watch them.  I sat through the entire movie and thought, \\"this is definitely one for the donation box\\". Like I said, I am a big fan of old movies, just not this one; I actually prefer the remake.
B004EPZ0BG|1.0|Yes, the movie made money. Yes, it was filmed in L.A. and N.Y. - where else, duh! Yes, the old salesmen trick of repackaging the same product to sell to the same schmuck by changing the packaging a little works as usual and always has and always will. So what do the cloistered writers, producers and directors in N.Y. & L.A. do with their lives well, sit in little pretend manly cubicles trying to tweak another dollar out of the rom-com boxed-in consumer. What is the formula that's tweaked? Middle class white professionals that cuss a lot to bluff toughness; sex dominates their discussions; monetary self interest dominates their social consciousness; parties, bars and objects-du-jour their support system. What's tweaked? Change an actor or two but not too many; change an office/occupation but not too many; change the social scenes but not too many. Everything else stays the same predictable self including the ending. Ah hah moment, the monetary comfort of predictability in exchange for the psychological comfort of predictable fantasy.
0375507256|5.0|David Mitchell's book Cloud Atlas is an epic trek through our post-colonial world. The story moves along a fictional timeline, switching writing styles, genres, and linked story lines as it goes. The setting for the novel travels from a 19th century South Pacific sea voyage to a dystopian future Hawaii, with stops in early 20th century Belgium, later 20th century California Coast, modern day British Isles, and not too-distant future Korea. Each segment of the book, which rises through history, making often sudden and jarring transitions, to a post-apocalyptic climax before falling back through the timeline to it's tour-de-force ending, features characters who are as compelling as they are complex. Despite the novel's different story lines, common themes of faith, brutality, corruption, and redemption are common to each.   What I liked best about Cloud Atlas is the meticulous attention to capturing the zeitgeist of each story line's age through its characters, language and style, all the while connecting them to the book's whole vision  An example of this is the titular composition \\"Cloud Atlas\\" by the tragic hero of the early 20th century, which he describes as a \\"'sextet for overlapping soloists': piano, clarinet, `cello, flute, oboe, and violin, each in its own language of key, scale, and color. In the first set, each solo is interrupted by its successor: in the second, each interruption is recontinued, in order. Revolutionary or gimmicky?\\" (p. 445) I would recommend this book whole heartedly to anybody who appreciates the craft of writing.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|Was looking for a case that was light weight, didn't interfere with the touch screen, and this one fits the bill.  It's a bit over priced for what it is (29 bucks), but it works well for what it is.  I bought this for my daughters K-Fire and she loves it, and that's all that counts.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Awewome! Love all of the different translations! Wi-fi is only needed for reading plans or non-downloaded translations. Very well done!
0380799006|5.0|I find myself recommending this book to parents of younger children. I had an earlier edition of this book, which I bought when my daughters were 2 and 4. I had a horrible relationship with my two years younger sister. Our last physical confrontation actually took place when we were 22 and 20.   When my daughters were small, I kept it in the bathroom, with all the chapter end cartoons dog-eared. When I could not figure out what to do about the fighting (all the time!), I would run in, close the door and frantically page through the little cartoons  until I found the one that reminded me of the lessons in that chapter. Sixteen years later, my daughters routinely end phone conversations with \\"I love you\\", support each other through tough times and enjoy spending time together.   When my second daughter was born, I realized that one of the greatest gifts I could give both kids was a close and loving relationship with each other. I had no idea at all of how to do that, until I read \\"Siblings Without Rivalry\\". This doesn't mean that kids sharing a home and parent(s) will never have conflict, but it does teach parents how to defuse the underlying issues that can create a very toxic and vicious relationship between siblings. I strongly recommend this book.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|very good entertainment. I will rate this game 5 stars. I never have one dull moment. a few games may be difficult but I keep trying and do my best to achieve the points.

B000088E6D|3.0|A heavy liquid products shipped with the 2 CD's caused a break to one of the CD covers, but no damage to the actual CD.  Items should have been shipped separately or packed correctly.   Bad Supervision on the final packing and shipment.
B004XN3FHA|5.0|OK, so it may not be a lightsaber.  When you power it on in turbo mode, you can almost hear that lightsaber whooshing sound as 800 lumens worth of photons fly across your back yard, your neighbor's backyard, his neighbor's backyard to around 400 yards.<br /><br />If you want a light that's built rock solid, is completely waterproof (IPX-8), and can almost replace the headlight of a car for a few hours of use, this is it.  The all-metal case is built solid and could double as a weapon if ever needed.  The choice of low / medium / high / turbo gives you a wide range of lighting options, from \\"make my batteries last forever\\" to \\"Can someone please turn night into day?\\"<br /><br />For those complaining that this light is too big or too heavy...Have you ever used one of those 4 or 6 D cell powered Maglites?  The TK41 blows them away at 1/3 to 1/4 of the size.  It fits nicely in your hand.  The weight comes from the rock solid metal build.  Maybe too heavy to wear on your belt, but definitely feels nice and solid in your hands.<br /><br />I recommend using SANYO eneloop AA NiMH Rechargeable 2500 mAh Batteries for long battery life and easy recharge.<br /><br />May the force be with you.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I really like these games, even though some of them are a little difficult to start out.  Some of them are a little confusing at first unless you read the instructions before you start.
B004VMUS9G|1.0|it works but when you go to turn it off you cant unlock it (on the kindle fire).... and drains batteries so do not get it
B001UV4XFG|5.0|They did a great job, everything was dilivered as promised and within the time frame as was promised. They did a great job and would not have a problem ordering from them again.
B003Y5H5AG|5.0|Saw this at the theater with grandkids and they fell in love with all the smurfs! I have a DVD in my car and pick up from school and activities a lot so definitely needed one in my car to occupy them!
B005LZW8FO|4.0|Another Earth received little attention in the theatres outside of most newspaper movie critics giving it decent reviews. It is a lower budget non- Hollywood film, and that probably effected marketing. Hopefully in the afterlife of theatres it gets it's proper praise. Rhoda, played astonishingly fresh by Brit Marling is a young woman who's brush with fate opens the doors of science fiction. On the night of her life changing fatal car accident science discovers a new planet in reachable distance to us.<br /><br />As the film evolves this planet is revealed to be another Earth through some of the most gripping and realistic scenes a sci-fi buff could dream up. All the issues of a paralellel Earth are subtly and not so subtly addressed in unique and awe inspiring ways. This is not a film for action junkies or those waiting for space monsters to pounce. It is the collision of old school science fiction with the everyday existence feel of a tragic drama.<br /><br />The complexities of another Earth are interesting to ponder, especially as we see it looming in the sky above the players. The other Earth is referred to, by us, as \\"Earth 2\\" which rightly prompts Rhoda's \\"boss\\" (played competently by William Mapother)to quip angrily, \\"Do you think THEY are calling US Earth 2?\\" Be warned that this movie was shot with a digital camera (very professionally) and can have a \\"direct to video\\" look, minus the routine story line.<br /><br />Another Earth is a rarity. It is (to my knowledge)one of the first films directed by newcomer Mike Cahill, who I think many will want to see more of. Every adjective associated with the words creative and fresh can easily be applied to this monumental film. Love and redemption become entangled as some of the best science fiction to date plays out. A soul piercing ending seals the deal. Definitely not a film for the artistically stunted.
B0063IH60K|5.0|this game is pretty good and the auto finish is really fast! I would recomend this game and spider solitaire as well!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is an amazing app!  My fourteen yr old uses it for church on his ipod.  I am pleased there are so many Bible versions available on a free app! I enjoy the reading plans and the ability to switch between translations easily.

B0053YGYO4|5.0|Admittedly, I'm a big Coldplay fan so I'm biased. Nonetheless, my take on Mylo Xyloto is that it is excellent in two ways: (1) awesome listen, (2) great change up of style from Coldplay.
B001RIY4WE|1.0|I recently bought the Terminator 2: Skynet Edition (from another retailer) and even though my player was made after this Blu-Ray was released and has all the current updates this is the only Blu-Ray that won't load up.  All I get is a black screen even after sitting in the player for over six minutes.  So while the movie is terrific, the Blu-Ray disc itself gets a 1 since it won't even load. I'll hold onto it just in case sometime in the future I get another brand of Blu-Ray player that can play this disc.  So I would say rent this first to see if your player can handle it or not. Otherwise buyer beware as you just may wind up with a movie that won't play at all.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Works well on my fire. Ads aren't distracting, and game play is smooth.  Great app!  I like that I'm able to win most deals, which makes it relaxing and frustration -free!

This is the perfect app for easily spending time in God's word!!!
1401207138|4.0|Great book, great edition, and great customer service by Amazon-<br />I did have a couple issues with the dust jacket though. The first copy I received had some markings on it, which appeared to be under the glossy coating of the jacket. It was enough to stick out against the bright yellow cover and ruin the look of it, so I returned it and Amazon promptly shipped me another. This one had some debris stuck to the back of the dust jacket, which I was able to kind of scratch off with my thumbnail and little water (causing very slight damage in the process.) I decided it was not very noticeable and kept this one. Overall it looks like whoever DC has manufacturing these things is not doing very good quality control before shipping. Just a caveat- it's still a great product.

B000SJJCX4|3.0|Ill start with the good. I have had pretty decent luck with Beherenger pedals. I really like this for what it is, a 23 dollar pedal tuner. Its fast, accurate, and i love the strobe feature.   Now the bad. I have this hooked up with signal coming from the tuner output of my Ernie Ball VP JR Vol Pedal. That means that my signal starts at the vol pedal and the tuner works even when the pedal is down. There is no signal coming out of the tuner at all, the signal to the rest of my chain and to my amp comes out of the main out on the vol pedal.  The issue i am running into is that with the tuner on, my amp will buzz. When i click the tuner off, buzz goes away. What puzzles me is that there is no signal running through the tuner to the amp. My only guess is that i is causing electronic interference through the one spot daisy chain power adapter that powers ALL my pedals. If i put a battery in the tuner and unplug the power adapter there are NO ISSUES AT ALL. So in short if you are using a power adapter that powers all your pedals be careful because you might get some buzz.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I love the simplicity of this cover.  Protects the screen, snaps on easily and nice angle for setting up on a table.  I've been using the stand and the Kindle Fire while doing home dumbbell workouts at home.

0307593312|5.0|I never thought I could enjoy a fantasy novel. I also doubted that I needed to read another book by Murakami. He is not among my favorite authors. I find him far too desperate to sell himself to Western readers for my taste. In this respect, he reminds me of Garcia Marquez whose novels were always about exoticizing and cutesefying Colombia as much as possible in search of global popularity and massive sales. I didn't have any great expectations for the novel which is why I was really shocked by how much I enjoyed it.<br /><br />Murakami still cannot keep his exaggerated desire to be relevant to his Western readers in check. Among all of the literary references in the novel (some of which are quite lengthy), there is a single Japanese one. Other than that one work of Japanese literature, the characters read Chekhov, Proust, Orwell, Dostoevsky, etc. The novel is filled with explanations of the \\"In Japan, banks work this way\\" and \\"Japanese police officers do this and that\\" variety that are, obviously, of no use to Japanese readers and that sound very strange in the mouth of a Japanese character talking to her friend. For instance, can you imagine regaling your childhood buddy with the information that, \\"In the US, we use ATMs to withdraw money\\"? Still, there is a lot less of this in 1Q84 than there is, for example, in Norwegian Wood.<br /><br />The fantasy aspect of the novel did not annoy me in the least. The reason why I didn't mind it in 1Q84 when I mind it everywhere else to a degree that borders on paranoid is that fantasy in this novel does not exist for its own sake. The Little People and the air chrysalises play a very limited role of highlighting how empty, emotionally barren and castrated the lives of all of the characters are.<br /><br />The characters of Murakami's novel are so completely lonely, miserable and emotionally stunted that the only two of them who had a single moment of actual human contact when they held hands at the age of ten are the truly privileged ones. The rest do not even have that.<br /><br />The Japan Murakami brings to us in 1Q84 is a place where people are so profoundly alienated that any one of them can drop off the face of the earth at any moment and nobody will even notice. And the scariest thing is that none of them seems to be even remotely conscious that there is something abnormal in living in a complete emotional and relational vacuum. By page 250, you get so desperate reading about the robotic existences of these characters that the irruption of fantastic elements feels entirely welcome. The mysterious evil Little People pose enough of a threat to propel the apathetic protagonists of the novel into some sort of reevaluation of their bereft existences.<br /><br />Murakami's trademark machismo is absent from this book. His tendency to resolve all of the conflicts and terminate all of the plot lines by getting the characters to kill themselves is almost gone, too, which is very refreshing. In this novel, Murakami has dramatically improved his not inconsiderable strengths while eliminating most of his weaknesses.<br /><br />I have no knowledge of Japan that would enable me to judge whether there is some kind of a social reality behind the terrifying alienation described in 1Q84. What I can say, however, is that Murakami has definitely outdone himself in this novel. It is incomparably better than his previous work and I highly recommend it. If you never read Murakami before, start with this novel. It will take you forever to read it, but it will be a very enjoyable forever.even have that.

B005GVF95O|4.0|This is a fun little app to play with my 3 year old. He really enjoys putting puzzles together, so this was a good one for him. He caught on very quickly, so it didn't take long for him to finish all of them in less then ten mind. I guess I'll see if there are more to download.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I switch from tootle task to evernote. It has been great. All my PCs phone and tablet are sync all the time! So at home of something comes to mind I just ad it to my home Pc when I get to the office there it is!
B001AQO3QA|5.0|To start with I will just tell you this; the Alien Anthology Bluray set is a must own for any Alien fan or Cinefile in general. Besides having the first two amazing films and the other ones nobody really cares about; you get an insane amount of behind the scenes material to watch.  Alien-  Movie-5.0/video-5.0/sound-5.0  I won't waste my time reviewing the movie itself - it is awesome. This is the original Ridley Scott masterpiece that started it all.  The film and sound quality are amazing. This is truly one of the greatest transfers of such an old movie; it definitely ranks up there with 2001: a space Odyssey (another Bluray favorite of mine).  Aliens-  Movie-4.5/video-4.5/sound-5.0  Aliens is James Cameron's marine filled take on the Alien tale; and it is awesome. It features one of the most epically badass final acts you will ever see in a sci-fi action film. Blah blah, it is awesome.  The video quality, while not as impressive as Alien, still looks very sharp. The video and sound will please.  The other movies I don't really feel the need to talk about.  ALien 3/Movie-3.5/video-4.0/sound-4.5  ALien Resurrection/Movie-3.0/video-4.0/sound/4.5  The special features are absolutely amazing, even the material for Alien 3 and Resurrection are worth a watch.   Overall this is a 5 star box set all the way. But this now!

0470449748|4.0|This is a well written book and prepares you reasonably well for GMAT.   The verbal section I would say is really good and worthy of 5/5. The math section has some easy problems depending on your background but then it also has some medium-difficult ones probably in a 60/40 ratio so I'd give it a 3.5/5 there.   I don't know what some of these reviewers are talking about in terms of lack of explanation, if anything there is too much explanation... each question has an answer where they explain the reasoning behind the question and the correct / incorrect answers.
B000FGGE68|2.0|I've tried to watch Ultraviolet several times and failed (after being sent the product erroneously several times). Visually intriguing, the plot of this movie falls apart rapidly and the acting, while not horrific, has nothing to recommend it.  It speaks to the movie, I suppose, that repeated attempts to give it away to friends has resulted in a very dusty copy still sitting on my bookshelf.

B004EBZX6W|3.0|I installed WiFi Analyzer in mid-December, 2011.  Worked great.  On a trip to Brooklyn over Christmas I used it in a high-rise condo and it lit up like a fireworks display.  Too many WiFi networks to fit neatly on the screen.  After the holidays I tried it again at my home (away from NYC) and it has stopped reporting anything.  I'm connected to my local WiFI okay, but it doesn't show ANY detected WiFi networks.  Not sure what caused it to stop working, but I did apply a dozen or so updates to a variety of programs on my Galaxy Tab and one of them may well have updated WiFi Analyzer to a point that it no longer functions on my tablet.  I've uninstalled / reinstalled a couple of times but it has not fixed anything.  Maybe a fix will be coming soon?

I prefer this 100% over the bulk.  Wish I had ordered the stylus same time.  Now I know from reading previous reviews that the stylus will fit in the zip case.  I will order right away.I am quite satisfied with my purchase! :)  Hats off too AMAZON!!!

1576754227|5.0|This is a fit for purpose, functional book which is perfect for those that need it.  Those giving it less than 5 stars are missing the point...this is a get going, Eat the Frog book for those who avoid Eating the Frog daily.  If you want to know why you don't eat the ugliest frogs first  or why you are unable to delay gratification......then pick another Tracey book...  Bought this gift for my lovely but procrastinating husband.  Watched him get frustrated with ugly frogs hanging aroound for weeks and eating them at the very last minute (whereas I eat the uglies first). The book is for procrastinators who would probably put off reading Tracey's longer (more comprehensive) books! My husband is busy and does not sit to read long books often and I thought this book would be great.  It is.  I read the reviews, realising that if you need this book, you probably are not going to be motivated to wade through 280 pgs with theory, background, etc...because those books are more those wanting more analysis, theory and reflection - wanting to understand why they delay.  This book focuses on moving forward now.
B002ZG99TA|5.0|This is \\"Speed\\" (1994) on rails.<br /><br />A half a mile long runaway freight train barrels down a populated area in southern Pennsylvania at 50 miles an hour. If not stopped safely, a lot of people may die.<br /><br />The clock ticks on a \\"missile the size of the Chrysler building\\" that's tearing through the small towns of Southern Pennsylvania's countryside. It's loaded with tons of toxic chemicals. Who's going to stop it?<br /><br />Why, the veteran locomotive driver Frank (Denzel Washington) of course and his younger sidekick Will (Chris Pine) who both have some strikes against them.<br /><br />Frank has already been fired by the management, and is 72 days into his 90 days of notice. So he has to risk his life not to save the company that sacked him but the innocent people of PA. He's a contemporary cowboy riding a runaway \\"metal horse\\" with two outcomes: either he'll succeed stopping it or will die with it.<br /><br />Will has pulled a gun on a cop to defend his wife and is in deep trouble both with the law and his wife. The judge issued a restraining order to save his wife from another close encounter. Now it's time to redeem himself against all odds.<br /><br />After the first attempt to stop the runaway train \\"777\\" ends with a derailment, explosion, and death of a veteran driver, Frank and Will devise a plan: they will race backwards and catch the 777 from its tail end. They'll hitch to 777 and then gun their own engine in the reverse direction to slow it down. We expect a metal to metal confrontation and the sparks to fly and they do!<br /><br />Tony Scott, the director, said \\"this was the physically and mentally the toughest movie I've directed\\" and he may be right about it. \\"Unstoppable\\" is a thriller full of action scenes that keeps you at the edge of your seat.<br /><br />Super action entertainment with a predictable redemption theme. Recommended.
034552554X|5.0|Victoria Jones is a victim of the foster care system. Given away at birth and repeatedly shuttled between loveless homes, it is no surprise that Victoria is both socially and emotionally stunted. But at age 9 she's placed in the home of Elizabeth, a single woman who is also a vintner. As Victoria struggles with becoming attached to Elizabeth and growing into a healthy child, Elizabeth begins to teach her the Victorian rituals surrounding the language of flowers. The language of flowers is one of the oldest arts, and given that each flower has a meaning and an intention, what first only looks like a beautiful bouquet is transformed into a message to its recipient. From terse and abrupt to involved and intricate, Victoria begins to learn the definitions of the flowers and to access her innermost feelings through the art that Elizabeth so tenderly impresses upon her. But Elizabeth is also struggling with issues within her own extended family, and when Victoria takes it upon herself to garner retribution and secure her position in Elizabeth's life, everything is changed in an instant. Now, many years later, Victoria has a chance to make amends in a very unusual way. Living the life of a damaged individual, she once again discovers the power of the language of flowers and their ability to heal her and erase her once unbearable past. But is it too late for Victoria? Can the damage wrought on her heart and psyche be washed away with delicate blossoms and hardy stems? It's in Victoria's journey that the past, present and future collide, and where the most painful and hopeful secrets must be uttered by the flowers and the secret messages they themselves deliver.<br /><br />Though this book didn't make it on my best of 2011 list, it was by far the best book I read over the last year. The reason it wasn't there was because I hadn't reviewed it yet and I felt a little silly raving about a book that I had not yet shared my thoughts about. I put this book off for a long while, and while my mind and all the other reviews I read were telling me it would be unforgettable, I had no idea how much this book would break open my soul and cause me to weep and grow anxious with anticipation. It's not a happy book by any means, but it is a book that reflects on what it might be like to grow up damaged and what it might be like to try to unfurl all of those creased parts of your heart into a semblance of some type of normalcy.<br /><br />At times this was a physically painful book to read. Victoria is so far from normal and so alienated that even her existence is one that most readers will find strange and unfamiliar. Growing up in the foster care system, Victoria has been through every permutation of neglect, from the loveless homes to the abusive homes and everywhere in between. When the book opens, Victoria is just turning 18 and is being emancipated from her group home, yet where she will end up is uncertain because she has no life skills to speak of. Emotionally, she's still an angry child, and it takes several strange circumstances for her to even begin to be able to care for herself. She is the ultimate damaged individual and can't tolerate being touched or have a normal conversation with anyone. It was hard to read about the life she was living, and when the opportunity came for someone to help her, I held my breath and urged her on quietly, afraid that she might turn tail and run.<br /><br />When Victoria discovers that her affinity and knowledge of flowers and their meanings still survive intact inside her mind, she begins to slowly edge out into the real world and takes a job where these skills will serve her well. It's here that she comes face to face with her past and a fragile and tentative bond begins to form between Victoria and a person from that past. But even as she goes forward, she's unable to think and react in the ways that a normal person might, and her atypical behavior takes her further and further into the maw of irreparablebrokenness and solemnness. I have to say that some of the things that she did during her struggles to become whole had my heart and mind twisting uncomfortably. Victoria is not normal, and though she's not a bad person, she has almost no way of reacting to situations in a way that others would understand. It was almost as if she was a sort of primal and unformed person who only dealt with the visceral and who couldn't understand even the basic underlying structure of being whole and emotionally healthy.<br /><br />I fear that in writing this review I've made the book sound very dour and dark, and in a way it was, but in other ways it was beautiful and triumphant and uplifting. It's the kind of book that grabs you from the inside and pulls and never lets you stop feeling, never lets you rest in the certainty of Victoria's future, and it's a book that will leave an impression on you a mile deep. As a bonus to the incredible story, the book also includes a Victorian dictionary of flowers and their meanings, which I found impossibly wonderful and very apropos. If you haven't already added this one to your list, don't wait any longer. It's a book to be savored but also one that will first break and then heal your heart. Highly recommended.ave to say that some of the things that she did during her struggles to become whole had my heart and mind twisting uncomfortably.

B0055SWM08|5.0|Absolutely amazing and beautiful game. The music is wonderful too. It's a great puzzle game, probably the best on Android.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|it is easy to use and  has lots of translation choices.  I love its simplicity and versatility. what can I say that hasn't already been said?
B005G4TJUC|5.0|Transformers is the best! With its great graphics and filming techniques, it's almost perfect! This action-packed movie is full of exciting scenes (which is fighting), and well-crafted. I was never confused when watching this movie! What a 5-star movie!
0439023521|5.0|Awesome story line that really draws you in and keeps you reading.  I couldn't put it down and read it in just a few hours.
0385534639|5.0|I don't remember why I bought this book, but it must be one of the best mistakes ever.  Loved it, a new and fresh story, catching and fun.
0439023491|5.0|Collins does it again with another story that you just can't put down.  I loved the twist and excitement throughout.
B0042RJWTC|1.0|Bought this as a gift but there are two discs that are identical. Beware - they are each labeled so it looks like the complete series but one disc is duplicated so the set is incomplete. Wish there was a way to be sure another set wouldn't have the same problem.
0439023513|4.0|Though I still enjoyed it, MockingJay didn't quite live up to my expectations after reading Hunger Games and Catching Fire.
B0058RCVYS|5.0|Very good acting. Very emotional. I empathized with every character! I was very impressed with the the actors and writers, who weaved the story in a way that we were kept on edge wondering with the characters, what was going on.
B005GFPZYK|1.0|This book was a major disapointment' \\"you Yankee's\\" and \\"y'all\\"...last time I checked, the U.S. military was an arm of the federal government, not the Texas state government.

The paddings to protect your camera wasn't so thick but it is much better that what I currently got.  I am not a professional photographer but I would still recommend this for hobbyist like myself.
B000LC4CVA|5.0|Fast shipment and good product, also a good price. I will buy again with Amazon. I recommend this DVD to others, you will have a nice experience. This is the second DVD, the first one was take it from my collection by a friend first time he saw it.
0743298039|4.0|Using her captivating gift of language, Diane Setterfield weaves as fascinating tale about the secretive world famous author Vida Winters in The Thirteenth Tale. After years of writing beloved novels, the world had become intrigued by her own story which she had guarded for years by telling other stories to the reporters. Now, Ms. Winters requests that a biographer, Margaret Lea come to her home and write her story--the thirteenth tale--the true story of her life.<br /><br />With the Angelfield family estate falling into ruins, a mysterious fire, ghosts and strange people the truth seems only another illusion while hearkening to the beloved Gothic stories of the Bronte sisters. The Thirteenth Tale is a spellbinding ghost story with rich language and eccentric and intriguing characters that will keep you up reading late into the night.
1612130283|5.0|Until the 50 Shades series, I had never even picked up a romance novel -- (not even the corny tempting ones that my Mom used to have laying around with a topless Fabio on the cover).  Yet last Thursday, the ladies at my hair salon on the upper East side were RAVING about this book.  I am not talking about some elderly, blue-haired ladies, I am talking New York's society ladies that rarely admit to reading anything but the NY Times and classic British literature!  With such raves, I downloaded the Kindle version while under the dryer... and the rest is history - I am 100% in love with these books.  Never have I been unable to stop reading.  My husband is utterly perplexed that he has been completely unable to remove my Kindle from my hands for the last 72 hours!  I even dream about these characters!  I emailed the publishing company, as I am on pins and needles for book 3, 50 Shades Freed.  They promise the Kindle version should be available on Amazon.com by Jan. 19, 2012.  Here is to counting down the days!!!!
B00062PN6I|4.0|it looks in very good quanlity, but the adaptor dose not fit my labtop, it  is a pity, but the headphone weres very comfortable, worth the price.

B004UHL9EK|1.0|As with Greg H. my Kindle Fire closes when the timer gets to zero. I love the app on my Droid Charge.<br /><br />4/25/2012 - Got an alert that the issue was corrected so I fired up the app (or tried to) and I was told that I no longer have the app, but that I could buy it. What??? How can I have the app on my Fire and then no longer have access to it???
B0055SWM08|5.0|This game is a lot of fun, definitely more challenging as you go. A lot of replay-ability in trying to get a perfect score on each level.
B005K17RU0|4.0|No obvious problems on the Kindle Fire. What would make it 5 stars is the presence of a dynamic app Icon that showed temperature and conditions.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|Just what I asked for....  Even college girls like harry potter.  Our daughter was surprised and excited.  Shipped on time, great packaging, and perfect condition  Amazon  you are the best!!  [[ASIN:B005OCFGTO Harry Potter: The Complete 8-Film Collection]]
B0058EBNAO|5.0|I like this app, been using it for months, and it is both customizable, and easy to use. impressive. I use it for keeping track of the weather for when I fly my airplane.

B002TLSSXO|4.0|this product works as they promised, and i do enjoy them, however, for those of us who have a habit of balancing our utinsils on the edge of the pan, the colored handles melt at a very low temp... so beware of that fact... i realize that the point of these is so you don't have to do that but habits are hard to break...
B0054JZC6E|4.0|have so much fun playing. however I wish it didn't take so much time to accumulate money to open new games.
0525423656|3.0|I devoured Matched in a matter of 48 hours. I loved it. I couldn't wait for Crossed to come out. However, I found myself wanting to skip pages when I read Matched. It felt like Cassie just kept wandering and wandering. I just wanted her to find Ky. I almost stopped reading at some points. I realize the wandering was significant for the storyline but it just felt a bit drawn out for me. HOWEVER, by the time I got to the end of the book things got exciting. The turn of events at the end and the revelations about Xander added some complexity to the story. I can't wait to see what happens in book 3.  Don't be expecting another Matched but it looks like we are going back to excitement for book 3. Worthwhile read but not as enchanting as Matched.
B006MHWXMS|1.0|this app has yet to open properly ... have to force close each time. uninstalled after 3 attempts. not worth the trouble
B005DF2QMC|1.0|Product came nicely packed.  I opened it up and put the batteries.  It requires PC.  So make sure you have a PC.  I'm a Mac user, but the main page clearly warns, but does not mention that there is no way to use it on a Mac, period.  I put the batteries for the player which is inside the tape compartment and closed the lid and pressed rewind.  Nothing.  Pressed forward. Nothing.  I've looked all over to see if there is a ON button anywhere.  The manual that came long did not mention anything about putting batteries either.  So, I removed the batteries and tried just in case the device is USB powered.  Overall, a lousy product.  Don't waste your time.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|I have evernote on my phone and my kindle fire and I love it. I use it for everything, big or small.  The team at evernote have made a great app and they always have great improvements in the updates.
B00005JK8K|5.0|This is a very under-rated movie and the subject of the film is long overdue. Our Native Americans are shown as modern day citizens and their exceptional contribution to our present day freedoms.  They deserve our respect and reverence as much as any soldier, considering all the betrayals Native Americans have endured at our hands.  Very realistic, revealing and deserving of watching; has a wide range of characters beyond the Windtalkers, showing the realities of life in the armed forces.    Graphic and not for the young, this is a very adult movie, though no one should have to witness such realities of war.   Well written, well acted, well-filmed, etc.  I don't know why it didn't get more recognition and accolades when it first came out.    *Highly Recommend
B005GVF95O|5.0|First off, I want to give a HUGE THANK YOU for another GREAT review to Superman75!!! I am not sure what people's problems are, although (sometimes) his rating is lower than it should be, his reviews usually make up for it in entertainment!!! I mean, who else on Amazon puts this much effort into providing QUALITY (hilarious) reviews on a daily basis!? Not the lame people who can't take a joke! SMH! I say, Superman75 should ignore the idiots that don't understand what he brings to the table! Keep up the GREAT work Superman75!<br /><br />My next gripe is with the idiots who are complaining about the FAotD being a kid app, or how they want to review it for themselves, instead of for their kid... REALLY, y'all THAT stupid! SMDH! I believe the app pretty much SCREAMS kid app. If you don't have a kid... umm, its FREE, which means you didn't pay for it... which means, STOP YOUR WHINING! And if you are too stupid to realize that this app is not for 35YO's and you still want to review it from a 35yo's point of view, then GOD HELP YOU! OH, and to the people who rate apps low because your device doesn't allow Amazon apps to download or can't figure out technology... you're more useless than \\"trolls\\"!!!<br /><br />As for the app, its great for little kids. Little kids, who could care less about pixelation, about simplicity, about any of the \\"caveats\\" that the 3 & 2 star reviewers mentioned! And I'm sure NO app is going to hold a 4 or 5yo's attention for longer than 15mins! If it does... that kid fell asleep! SMH!

B0036OS3Q0|3.0|I got these boots as a Christmas gift. I am also in between sizes, normally ordering a 6.5 in boots. I ordered up with a size 7 and the boots are way too big length wise. Besides the length they felt pretty good. Unfortunatly I am going to have to return them and I think the size 6 would be too tight around my foot. I love Crocs but sure do wish they made 1/2 sizes.
0312641893|5.0|To be honest when I first read the summary of this book I thought 'Cyborgs? Androids? Moon people? Cinderella?! Wha...?' I think I read lots of genres, but science-fiction isn't one that I have too much experience with. I probably would have passed on this book--which would have been a real shame--if not for the trickle of glowing early reviews. Plus, I am a sucker for that cover. I love it. So, I read it. I wasn't even finished with the first chapter before was I thinking 'Cyborgs! Androids! Moon people!!' and many other things that ended with exclamation points. This book is one of the most creative things I have read in a long time.<br /><br />It didn't take much time to get into the futuristic world that Meyer created. Sometimes the first half of a book with a fantasy world is slow because there is so much info and back story involved. I didn't think Cinder was slow at all. The pacing was perfect. I did read it at a slower pace, but that was because I wanted to savor it.<br /><br />Cinder may have some metal limbs and internal wiring, but she was just a normal girl. She didn't fit in. She wasn't loved like she should have been, but she was strong and confident. She was very easy to relate to. I found all the characters to be enjoyable and very well written.<br /><br />There is lots of mystery in the story. Cinder doesn't know exactly who she is or where she came. I guessed the outcome to that pretty early on, but that didn't take anything away from the story for me. There were still a few surprises along the way.<br /><br />My most favorite part of course was the world in which Cinder lives. It was a scary place to be, what with imminent war and plagues, but I found it utterly fascinating. I can't wait to find out even more history.<br /><br />Overall, I really, really loved this book. I think that it is a must read. I don't want to hear any of that 'I don't like sci-fi.' stuff, because I think this one is for everyone. You don't want to miss it!
B004LROUNG|5.0|This is the first time I read a John Grisham book. I have seen several of his movies from the books he has written, and I made a good choice in purchasing this latest one, The Litigators. I couldn't wait to read the next few chapters to see what the charaters were up to next. This was a fun read, David Zinc's character kept me rooting for attorneys like him, and I would hope there were more attorneys like him in real life. I will search for another story to purchase for my Kindle, and it will definitely be a book written by John Grisham...I am hooked. Thank you John Grisham for writing a great story.

B006FTCH2E|5.0|I enjoyed this movie immensely!  It's one of the most original, thought-provoking, non-HollyWood stories I've seen in a long time.  If you're expecting typical Science Fiction fare, with the typical Michael Bay treatment - this is NOT the movie for you.  If you enjoy a great story, that requires the ability to read subtext, then you will enjoy this a lot.
B006OV7RQ4|4.0|\\"We all love each other very much, we're all together on this, you have to trust us. Do you believe me?\\" Martha (Olsen) is brought by a new friend to a farm. After a night she will never forget she is told how great it is and is told what to do with her life. After finally breaking out she tries to start her life over with her sister and brother-in-law but her old life is still haunting her. This is a very great, powerful and disturbing movie all in one. Elizabeth Olsen gives an amazing performance and in one movie breaks out of her sisters' shadows in a big way and to me shows something they never have shown...talent. This movie is hard to watch in a few spots but well worth it. This is not a movie for everyone as it is a little slow and a borderline \\"art-house\\" type movie but it is a movie that will also appeal to a lot of people. This is a rare type of movie that seems like it tries to win an Oscar, but is actually good and deserves it. Overall, not a movie for everyone, but those that watch it and understand it will love it. I give it a B+.

0307959856|2.0|I approached this book with keen anticipation, having greatly enjoyed PD James' work over the years, and of course, treasuring Austen and particularly Pride and Prejudice.  I was sadly disappointed however. The principal Austen characters - particularly Elizabeth and Darcy felt small - they were not brought to life  in their original strong, endearing personalities. Where was the forthright Elizabeth or Darcy, the man of action, of the original? Did this all end with their union? Were they merely a proper and conservative married pair ever after?  In this novel, they were merely part of the setting and not active participants in the novel's plot. Wickham's and Col Fitzilliam's characters were the only ones that received substantial development, the latter rather mystifiying.  Second the tone of the novel was cloyingly reminiscent of period works like those of Anne Perry, seeking to portray a bygone milieu. No way did the author succeed in carrying over the sprightly, still immediate, tone of the original.  Third the book had a creaky plot that never really got going.  Where was the action?  How was the truth discovered? By confessions that might not ever have occurred but for the need of winding the thing up. There was no process of detection or discovery and no real protagonist.  There was enough unneccesary repetition and padding (recapitulation of prior events in Pride and Prejudice) to suggest that some editing and rewriting would have been beneficial.  Too bad the Baroness ran out of gas, this was a fine idea.

B000VBIGD6|5.0|Poor Clark Griswold! First he gets a giant tree that is WAAAAAY too big for the living room, then he decorates his house with thousands of lights that don't work until his wife figures out that it's merely a switch in the laundry room.  His mentally challenged but well-meaning cousin shows up in a REALLY beat-up motor home...too many hilarious situations to describe here.  Get it - you'll LOVE it!!

1563899426|5.0|Fables, Vol 1: Legends in Exile collects Fables #1-5 from the ongoing DC-Vertigo series.<br /><br />Bill Willingham accomplishes everything in this introductory volume of Fables that any good comic should.<br /><br />For starters, it's a fantastic concept. I can't imagine anyone in the world who isn't familiar on some level with the source material whether they read nursery rhymes and fairy tales as a child or watched Disney animated classics like Snow White and Cinderella. Fabletown is immediately accessible due to this familiarity. From the start the reader is already invested in the new spin on these characters' lives.<br /><br />These \\"Fables\\" aren't just simple regurgitations of their Grimm Fairy Tales inspirations. Willingham explores the heart of each character. What makes them tick? If they were real and existed today in the modern world we know, who would they be?<br /><br />Bigby Wolf (aka the Big Bad Wolf from the 3 Little Pigs and Red Riding Hood) is a wolf in sheep's clothing - a beast in a human disguise, a former terror now the sheriff, but can he be trusted?<br /><br />Prince Charming is a womanizer, a cheater, and a mooch, using his charm to leech off anyone he can.<br /><br />Pinocchio, in one of the more humorous scenes, is a young boy angry because he can never grow up. His wish to be a real boy was taken a little too literally.<br /><br />\\"Legends in Exile\\" probably isn't the best title for this volume. Yes, it's in there, but it's more the setting than the plot. We know the Adversary as it is simply known ran all the Fables out of the Fable Realms. The \\"lucky\\" ones made it out alive and banded together to form Fabletown as a safe haven for their kind to unify. Of course, most Fables originate out of bits of nastiness like Bluebeard, Jack the giant-killer, and the Black Woods Witch, so unity isn't always easy. Fabletown is built on a rocky foundation, and that's where the plot comes into play.<br /><br />Snow White's sister, Rose Red, has gone missing, possibly murdered. Murder isn't the sort of incident a fragile town needs, so it's up to Bigby and Snow White to solve the case before the \\"Remembrance Ceremony.\\" From there, the whole story essentially turns into an Agatha Christie-style murder mystery complete with the final \\"parlor scene\\" that Bigby is rather enthusiastic about.<br /><br />One of the downsides of mysteries is often that the clues are there, scattered throughout the story, but they lead to few obvious assumptions. Detectives often string together ridiculous minute observations to miraculously solve a case. Sometimes the most important clues are never even revealed to the reader. That is not the case here. Willingham lays the foundation for this whodunit perfectly. I had questions along the way about the investigation. I won't mention any to keep this spoiler free. When it came time for the big reveal, my questions were answered with the clues I spotted addressed. No solution materializes out of nowhere. Every element of the mystery was presented to the reader, which made it very satisfying. Not that the mystery has an obvious solution. Willingham creates enough drama between these Fables to keep us guessing. I saw some of the solution coming from a mile away, which I think  only made it more satisfying. Who doesn't love the moment they get to say to themselves, \\"I noticed that! I knew something was up with that!\\" Isn't that the point of a mystery? For the reader to play detective, too?<br /><br />Overall, this introductory volume is a fantastic blend of mystery and imagination.

B004K8WPUQ|5.0|I spent several hours reviewing various microphones online and concluded that the Videomic Pro is the one to get if you want to improve the audio on your video.  The regular VideoPro mic is great, but I chose this one becuase it is significanly shorter.  Shorter is better if you plan to use this mic on a DSLR.  I use mine on my Sony A65 and my Panasonic TM700 with great results.  The size is just right on my camera and does not intrude into the video frame.  The improvement in audio quality is dramatic and the unit is very well made.  I consider this money well spent!
B005GVF95O|5.0|Cute app!  I can't wait to share it with all the toddlers I know. It works smoothly, and has beautiful graphics. App2SD is also a big plus for me.

0439023521|4.0|Adding my own modest review to the slew of them already here, I have to say that I avoided reading this book for some time. I'd heard all the hype, but that was not enough for me. Then a family member read the trilogy and kept raving about it. Then the movie trailer came out. OK, I thought, I 'll give it a shot.  Well, it is a tale well told. The author knows how to generate interest in a character, and make bad things keep happening to her. Very, very skillful. There are some places where the style is a little clumsy, but that is a very small matter. I will take great storytelling over perfect style every time. The Hunger Games is not completely original in plot. It's like Deathrace 2000 or Rollerball. But because of the characters, Ms. Collins pulls it off. Kudos!
1400032717|5.0|The seller shipped the item quickly.  It was just as described.  Very pleased with this transaction.  Thank you!  Looking forward to buying from you in the future. (if I am in need of your listed items!)
B006O5M7RY|1.0|Don't buy this book if you're expecting the the complete anthology! Nowhere in the product description does it say that it only contains 4 stories. This is unacceptable!<br /><br />The stories in this edition are:<br /><br />- The Repairer of Reputations<br />- The Mask<br />- The Yellow Sign<br />- The Demoiselle d'Ys<br /><br />... and NOTHING ELSE!
B005NGKLX2|2.0|This movie was a great disappointment.  It is not one of those great westerns that occasionally pop up out of nowhere like Seraphim Falls, or The Proposition.  Instead this film comes with a breathtakingly beautiful trailer and the rest is rather mediocre.  In my opinion the film looks and feels a bit amateurish.  I know this is a harsh critique, but in between the gorgeous landscape shots there is very little story, with a lot of repetitive, awkward dialog, continuity errors, and some scenes with lighting issues.  Unfortunately I was so impressed with the trailer that I bought the Blu Ray, and now after having watched about half of the film I'm ready toss the disc.  Save your $$, rent the movie and see for yourself.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great game and time waster works great on my kindle.fire. great if u r at home or doctors office. I would recommend for.all ages
B00009R6H2|4.0|Bought this to add to a second DSLR to make it easy to swap cameras when necessary. Build quality is very good. With the manfrotto tripod this cani support my largest camera and lens - a Canon 5D Mk II with the battery grip anwin 70-200mm f/2.8L lens - about 7 or 8 lbs. release mechanism is a little interesting, but workable.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is a great app. Its nice cause if your doing Bible study it can read it to you!! I regimend this app!! :)
B005GVF95O|5.0|What a great little app.  My toddler absolutely loves it.  Colorful, fun, professional art style, and pieces that \\"snap\\" into place with just the right tolerance. Thanks devs, thanks Amazon.
0374275637|2.0|This is another of those opinion pieces that titillates the minds of those who seek affirmation.  And in these days who doesn't?    It is entertaining and makes for nice sophomoric parlor games.  But I am once again offended to see emotional cognition labeled \\"irrational.\\" Further I personally don't think much of his \\"scientific\\" methods.   There will be no significant step forward until authors such as this are rejected in favor of those who models of human cognition incorporate emotional cognition. Man will remain essentially irrational and a failed species until this happens.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This is a book that I really enjoyed reading.  I am amazed at the depth of the author and his wife's commitment to their country.  I enjoy reading books about SEAL's in general and have read most of the memoirs on the market, however I would put this one near the top, if not at the top of the list.  (The only one I have read that I enjoyed and that touched me as much was Marcus Luttrell's \\"Lone Survivor\\" which I highly recommmend as well.)  I appreciated the author's honesty and candor the most.  The vignettes written by Kyle's wife Taya were a very good addition to the book.  Several other military memoirs that I have read barely mention the spouse, but I thought that Taya's viewpoints were very revealing both about the depth of their love for each other and also the stresses of war, stresses which I know are widespread throughout our military.  Thanks again Kyle and Taya for your service and for being willing to share about your lives.
0545265355|5.0|These books kept you on the seat of your pants. I was glad I had bought all three at once because I devoured them!
B000I9YX06|5.0|This is a fantastic adaptation of the novel and I love Smith's portrayal of the cop who is sarcastic, lovable, and heroic. Highly recommend.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|The case is really light, but stiff and hard, so it will protect your kindle. It feels nice to hold in your hand; it doesn't feel cheap. It stands up nicely. All together it is a great case.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is a wonderful app it is very easy to navigate.You never go wrong with a little word.God bless looking for great things to happen this year hallelujah thank u Jesus.
8862937148|5.0|I've been using it for a few years now. It's easy to carry around, and the design is simple and clear- just what I wanted.
B006C1DH92|3.0|It is hard to believe people would pay for this. Buy the original version, it is exactly the same only it loads much better and has more modes (and is part of the OpenFeint network).  This file is also needlessly large. The original fruit ninja is a small file. This sponsored version was the largest file size on my entire phone, larger than the second biggest by almost double. For such a stunted version of the game, what is going on behind the scenes that is that memory and size intensive?
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is an incredible app for exploring the Bible.  It also includes an audio function so you can listen to the passages as you read.  Syncs with your computer, tablet, and phone for bookmarks and notes.  Highly recommend!
B0053EZXRS|4.0|This is a great movie! It is not for those that want some moral ethics, or for some great deep drama; this is a movie for those that like fast action, lots shooting, and things blowing up. This will rank up with one of my favorite Nicolas Cage action films! I absolutely loved the female in this movie too, they allowed a female (Amber Heard) to be an extreme fighter in this movie, it made it fun to root the under guys. And yes the Accountant played William Fichtner was a wonderful addition to the action and fun of the movie.
B0015DROBO|5.0|I didn't really know what to expect, but I loved this book. I could not put it down, and I'm not sure if I want to see the movie now for fear of disappointment.
B002BCNK1Q|5.0|Really a movie that sucks you in, as you feel for the old man played by Clint Eastwood, and the family that is his blood that doesn't seem to understand him, with the family next door that embraces him. It was wonderful sharing difference of nationalities, generations, and life in general.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|lots of different options. I liked the variety and not knowing what you get til you play. I definately would recommend.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Just for bought Kindle Fire for birthday & I found this app which I truly love. When you are already reading a scripture, you can click small button of drop down menu & go to different scripture with ease. Highlights & bookmarks come in handy eespecially if you need to jump from one page to another really quick. The Readings Plans that you can ready are great so far I have read & finished about 3 or 4 since getting app almost 2 weeks ago. I read my bible everyday. I LOVE THIS.
B006BDHAX0|2.0|This would be a good game of Mahjong if it didn't constantly shut down on the Kindle Fire.<br /><br />The graphics are nice, the boards are challenging yet not impossible. I had to uninstall... it's just too frustrating when a game randomly wonks out.<br /><br />Hopefully the developers will release an update that will fix the bug for Kindle Fire, but- unfortunately app updates are so painfully slow to come through the Amazon app market- this game will live in the cloud.<br /><br />Too bad, it could have been a fun time-killer.
B001OQCV6A|5.0|The Sherlock Holmes stories were the stories that has spanned my early childhood, they were the ones that stood out, that made impact, and I can honestly say that as an obsessed Holmes story fan, this movie hit all the right notes for me so well, I could watch it again and again.  Was the movie word for word specific to the book? No. Was it perfect? No. But this is simply what it is, an adaptation that has brought the Holmes stories into this new generation and given it a fresh interpretation. It never claimed to be perfect, it never claimed to be all matching the source material, and one should never expect it to be either.  I think generations of people and even readers have got this image of Holmes in a cap and pipe and Watson bumbling around stuck in their heads, an image only perpetuated by the old school classic performances in the various TV and movie adaptations of the past. And it's not to say that those adaptations were not true to Holmes' work or the writing or acting was bad, but I can say that they were never the Holmes and Watson that I had always thought the books were telling me, especially the bumbling idiot sidekick they have made Watson into over the years. And I will admit the thought of another big Sherlock Holmes movie had me very concerned, I was not sure at all. But all my concerns were proved wrong because the movie was exactly what I had always hoped and dreamed for.  There may have been many great performances over the years of Holmes and Watson, but honestly, none of captured the spirit and essence of the characters as well as Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law. Their chemistry was so vibrant that it leaped off the screen and made their characters even more amazing and real. And I thank to God everyday for someone to FINALLY recognize Dr. John Watson for who he really is, a strong smart intelligent soldier and doctor who may not be a genius but was every bit the partner and companion to Sherlock Holmes. Watson has long been my favorite character, and it breaks my heart every time to see those old school adaptations reduce him to this idiotic foolish existence. Jude Law's performance is the first time in my life of all Holmes things that I felt this is exactly and perfectly the way I had always dreamed it would be. THIS was the Watson I remember from the stories and never saw until now. And needless to say the spark between Jude and RDJ is perfection, their timing was never off from each other, they had each other's backs, they were in sync, always matching, just the way I saw Holmes and Watson to be.   Sure there was more chases and actions and gunshots, but people seem to forget that Holmes and Watson were not just running around using their brains, they were proper fighters who could swing a mean punch as the next martial arts expert too. And to see this through this interpretation was something so refreshingly great about this movie. The characters used their brains, the moments of flashback and montage of the clues were a great way to show them, and they also had a strong balance of brawn to back it up too! Holmes was an expert fighter, and Watson was a soldier for God's sake! Someone had finally took notice!  But more importantly than just dialogue and storyline, what mattered to me was the heart and soul of the characters, and honestly this whole movie could have been about Holmes and Watson watching rabbits hopping and I would have still cheered because RDJ and Jude Law brought these two iconic characters to life and they kept to the spirit of these characters true to their core. And for that, I will forever be grateful to them for doing that!
B003VANOFY|5.0|This is just my first impression.<br /><br />Set up:<br />Setting up the software was easy, even if you lose the CD, you can always go to the Logitech website. The physical set up was easy as well. The charge cable is neat and can easily be rolled up.<br /><br />Headset:<br />The headset itself is certainly big and can be uncomfortable if you do not adjust it, as long as you get it to fit you, it will be great.<br /><br />Sound:<br />The sound is crystal clear and LOUD. You can always turn it down. The surround sound is clear but you should only use the SS if whatever you are doing actually has SS.<br /><br />Overall:<br />I am happy I picked this headset over the others. Sure there are better ones out there, but I am very satisfied with my purchase and looking forward to a long time with these guys.<br /><br />My other thoughts, do not put the wireless dongle in a 3.0 USB port, it does not groove well with the headset, I may be an isolated incident but why risk it? 2.0 is perfect.<br />I heard nothing but static the first time on, a quick restart and it was PERFECT from then after.<br />The headset can be a bit uncomfortable after long hours but that is the same with every headset.<br />I never use the voice mixer, the mic is great and picks up A LOT which can be good or bad depending on how you feel about it.<br /><br />This headset is a solid investment.<br /><br />BEST PART is the RANGE!!!!!!!!!!<br />HOLY GOD, I can literally walk down the stairs to the kitchen and STILL hear everything that is going on in perfect clarity.
B006GHA9QQ|5.0|This is a must have for any DVD collection.  I was actually at the performance when the filming was done.  The sets are amazing, something new to see every time you look.  Ben Lewis and Anna O'Bryne give memorable performances are The Phantom and Christine, and are well supported by Simon Gleeson, Sharon Millerchip and Maria Mercedes.  The score is one the best Andrew Llyod webber has written and the vocal talents of the cast blend beautifully with it.  My personal favorites are 'Til I hear you sing' and Beneath a moonless Sky
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I bought this package deal for my grown son as a Christmas gift.  In addition to his being 33 years old, the film was enjoyed by his wife and my 3 year old and 7 year old grandaughter also.  Being able to watch in Blu-Ray made the experience that much better.
B005K2XUPK|4.0|I really like this Kindle Fire case, the tablet fits like a glove. Has a good build quality to it, feels like it will last. I will say it is a tad snug, you almost have to force the tablet inside. But this is a minor glitches for me.
B001JNNDE2|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend. Not only was it MUCH cheaper compared to buying it in stores, but it arrived just in time for his birthday. I LOVE Amazon and he loved the gift.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|101-in-1Games is a great game but the game needs instructions. Like the sushi game, I don't even know how to get the sushi on the stick.
B005I6EVUG|5.0|After purchasing my Kindle Fire for myself for Christmas, I  knew I would need a cover for it.  This fits just right and I love the graphics on it.  It is nice and sturdy which is just what I was looking for.
0316098329|3.0|While I did enjoy this book I have to say it was just \\"okay\\". I love the personification of all the items in Room, but the story itself is slightly disjointed. Like two different books, which is okay I guess, just not in my taste. I felt like the first half of the book just kept dragging on, while the second half was quick and to the point. It was well written and was enjoyable to read. I would recommend it.
B001DDBCV4|1.0|We recently purchased the Blu-ray BECAUSE it is listed as including a digital copy.  When we tried to retrieve it, we were informed that the option for the digital download had expired in 2009.  Great movie otherwise..
0061969656|5.0|This is the sixth book of Bernard Cornwell's series \\"Saxon Tales\\". The tale of blood, gore, and intrigue maintains it's intensity. Indeed the first three pages embroil you in battle, and the fights continue.  Uhtred's position and influence among the Saxons increases in this volume, as King Alfred dies, and Edward takes the throne, but his main goal of recapturing his birthright Bebbanburg is not yet attained when the book closes.<br />Personally, as I read these tales, aside from Uhtred's escapades, it is his interactions with the priests that holds my interest. In this volume Bernard introduces yet another one, Cuthbert.  Cuthbert, proves to be as interesting a character as any of Bernard's other beloved priests, even if he does, perhaps even because of his fondness for fawns.  I look forward to the end of these tales, only because I'd like to draw up a monograph on pastoral theology using the characters of these stories, and it's depiction of Christianity.<br />In any case, those who have been following the story thus far, will no doubt once again enjoy the ease in which Bernard weaves the story of Uhtred, a thread through the canvass of war and blood shed marking this tumultuous period, as if he himself was sitting at the roots of Yggdrasil eavesdropping on the Norns in all their beauty. They will not be disappointed, and though one could pick up and begin reading her with this book, those that do, will be satisfying themselves with past volumes of this great story while waiting for the next installment.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this is a fun game that lets you earn points to move on to other games. some are. challenging while others are easy. regardless, its free so how can you go wrong?
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Great app to kill time. Not a lot of strategy involved, but gameplay is easy to understand and flows smoothly. Great for young kids.
B00005JO9J|1.0|I was expecting a \\"New\\" item to be in the plastic still. The DVD arrived in a manila type envelope and appeared to be in a used condition. This was a gift and I feel embarrassed to give without it having the plastic wrap on it. I needed it for this weekend so there is not time to return it. I am severely disappointed with this purchase.
0439023521|5.0|I was so glad I started this series after all three books were written because I couldn't put the first book down and wanted the second one and then the third one within days. Collins knows how to hook a reader with a sense of immediacy as if you'd walked into a life and death hostage situation on a \\"normal day\\" in your life. I felt if I left the book, Katniss would die or something terrible, so I had to keep reading! I didn't want to miss a minute - so THAT is writing! I'm very excited about the movie coming out and already have a date to see it with my best girlfriend and all our kids. It's definitely a book that speaks to all ages, and it reminded me of Brave New World and 1984, but I related to the main characters even more than I did in those books.<br /><br />P.S. When I said this book speaks to all ages, I didn't mean really young children, who might fear this is reality (although in some ways it is and that's the author's intent - to show us how we're not that far from this). The book has murder and death in it to a large degree. Not much different than world history, actually.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love it! it was such a great app. it keeps you easily entertained for days. the games are both fun and challenging.

0553801473|4.0|A dance with Dragons is a good book that has its moments, but the moments are to few.  I think this book was the weakest in the series but it was still a good book overall.  My biggest issue with the book was that it was over 1000 pages, but they did not manage to close or resolve any of the subplots in the story.  The book builds and builds pressure like some giant pressure cooker.  I keep turning the pages faster and faster, anticipating some great pay off, but once I get to around page 900, I begin to understand that the payoff that I am anticipating will not come.  The pressure cooker begins to build even more pressure, and just when it is about to explode.....  Its over.  I have to wait another 5 years to see what happens next.  I cant understand why we needed two books to tell all the things that have happened since a storm of swords.  I enjoyed A feast for crows unlike so many others, I even enjoyed this book.  I just felt like with the two books we should be further along in the story.  I love the idea of Danny staying in Mareen to set things right there.  That is consistent with the character.  I just wish they had fought whatever war they were going to fight and been done with it.  I love reading about John Snow and the Wall.  I just need him to fulfill his destiny.  I could not wait to see what happened when the Iron fleet landed in Mareen.  Now I am beginning to wonder if the Iron men will ever make it back to land at all.  Stannis, one of my favorite characters, getting up off the mat and giving it his best shot was also something I was looking forward to.  Its a shame that famous Stark saying has postponed his comeback.  In addition to this many of the cliffhangers of feast for crows were barely touched, or ignored all together.  All in all I think that GRRM sets the pieces in place masterfully for the next book, and I can not wait to read it.  It is time for this story to begin contracting.  The expansion phase has gone on long enough.  If he could have contracted some of the subplots and given us some satisfying closure to at least some of them, then this book would have been a masterpiece.  I give it a 4/5 when you consider this book as part of the whole story, but in truth it is closer to a 3/5.  Intriguing but not wholly satisfying.  This is the least of GRRM's books in the series.  But it is still better than the majority of books I have read this year.  I would recommend the book for die hard GRRM fans, but if you wait for the next book to be released and read this book two weeks before it came out you would be better off.

B0053JJLLC|2.0|I have read all of Crichton's fiction. I would not say that Micro reached the quality of the previous works. I wanted to read it knowing it was being completed by another author just as Pirate Latitudes had because I liked Crichton's style. I found the novel to lack a stronger science breakdown that Crichton normally delivered along with the interpersonal relationships he develops as well. The tone was off. I am not sure if I will read Richard Preston's material, but I will surely not read any more of Crichton's notes turned to novels after this.

1423140591|4.0|Although I don't quite fall into the youth category, I enjoy reading books such as these to keep up to date with what the younger generation are reading. While the first book in this series was not as good as the Percy Jackson series, I felt The Son of Neptune was a worthy addition to the chronicles of Percy Jackson who returns as the protagonist in this outing.<br /><br />To me it seemed the author was more comfortable with these characters than those in [[ASIN:142311339X The Lost Hero (Heroes of Olympus, Book 1)]] which in turn made me become more involved in their stories and care about them. The dialogue was crisp, often humorous and very indicative of teenage interaction, and there was enough action to keep the story moving along at a fast pace. The action was also more plausible to me than in the previous books, where sometimes a person was left thinking that it was not a realistic portrayal of what was essentially children warding off monsters with far too much ease. Although I am more acquainted with the Greek gods than the Roman, I could follow this story easily and was never bogged down by too many details or left wondering because of too few. The cliffhanger ending also promises a forthcoming adventure with Greek and Roman demi-gods possibly uniting which I believe will provide a very interesting and enjoyable read. An interesting twist was the addition of characters who are well-known to the reader but not the other characters in the book, which added a welcome sense of intrigue and suspicion.<br /><br />In conclusion, The Son of Neptune offers a quick, adventurous, entertaining read which I can strongly recommend.
B0062A5RUA|5.0|Great collection of 21 tracks and at $ 3.99 (digital download) that's an amazing price. A must have for every Slash & GNR fan. The quality of the Live recording is real good. Myles is cool but we miss that Axl voice.
0439023483|5.0|AMAZING!  This book is one of the greatest science fiction/ fantasy books around, and is my favorite book of all time.  Suzanne Collins definitely knows how to keep readers engaged! The Hunger Games is perfectly paced, and keeps you reading.  Once you are finished with the book, you will probably be up at night just thinking about it!  I would recommend this book to anyone who likes exciting and interesting reads.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|This is by far the best of all the eight Harry Potter movies, even though the first one will always hold a special place in my heart!  It is well done, well acted, well...everything! It was even fairly close to the actual storyline from the 7th book! Needless to say I simply loved it!!

B00514HDNW|5.0|Reviewing a classic is rather strange for me. It's like reviewing Oliver Twist, when almost everyone knows what it's about, due to movies, TV show references, and most recently in commercials urging kids to use manners.<br /><br />When people think of I Am Legend , they usually don't know it's a book, and just know it's a post apocalyptic movie where most of the population has been mutated into vampires, and Will Smith is the last man standing, blah, blah, blah.<br /><br />The movie was great, I admit it. But that was before I read the book. And like every other movie supposedly based on I Am Legend, like The Last Man On Earth and the very horrendous The Omega Man, the movies seem to exclude many of the main points that make the novel so great. I hope they actually make an accurate movie based on the book someday.<br /><br />Richard Matheson deserves a better movie adaption.<br /><br />Ok, now enough about the movie and on to the book. The book is set in the late 1970s. The world was decimated by a horrible virus, that turns men and animals into vampires. Robert Neville, the last man, as far as he knows, is fighting to survive. The book deals mainly with Robert's  internal struggle with insanity, which Matheson handles beautifully.<br /><br />I don't want to spoil the main points, so I urge you to read the book. :)<br /><br />Overall, I give the book 5 out of 5 stars!<br /><br />Available in most eBook formats and in print.
B002GHHHH4|1.0|I would not buy this movies again.The movie itself is good but no matter what I tried,I could not get the subtitles off of the screen.This is more than likely how the dvd was made.I have several other movies in which the subtitles disappear after going into the dvd player options.The tv version is better without alot of talking and music physically appearing on your tv screen.

I am using wireless system that has both wireless mic and Lapel mic on \\"MIC 1\\"  and regular mic (Wired mic) on \\"MIC 2\\". Connected the mixer to an effect unit and got a great sound with 16 effect. I took the system one step ahead and connected the mixer to a desktop computer. Now I have live recording and play back option. Good small mixer.
B004WCTLNY|5.0|I don't like romantic movies in general. I can watch it once and after that I just forget what it was about as they are all similar to me. But this one is different. I loved it. For me it is a smart, poetic and yet romantic.
0345529057|3.0|I just wanted to let anyone know who happens to read this to beware. The rave reviews given by so many well known authors give no warning that the content contains curse words and explicit sexual references. I encountered the first of the former on page 38 of A Game of Thrones, where the author dropped the f-bomb. In the chapter leading up to it were a couple of explicitly sexual references where for example the author described a brother of a 13 year old girl pinching her nipple, and then later the same girl having perfume applied...well, just consider the following:  \\"...while the old woman anointed her with the spiceflower perfume of the Dothraki plains, a dab on each wrist, behind her ears, on the tips of her breasts, and one last one, cool on her lips, down there between her legs.\\"  I stopped reading a few pages after but skipped ahead to the part where Dany and her husband go on their honeymoon ride to see if my suspicions were correct. They were. It gets much worse.  And hey, that's fine. I use the word \\"worse\\" relatively speaking. It's a mature story. But to compare the author to Tolkien is taking things a bit too far. I've been reading (and re-reading) Tolkien since I was a pre-teen and I've never experienced anything remotely sexually explicit. I can't even recall any explicit cursing.  I'm just glad I didn't give the book to my 11 year daughter to read. She had already asked me to let her read it and snatched a couple pages of reading from it before school one morning. I'm returning the whole series. I'll stick with bestsellers that provide fantasy without the sex and cursing.  Take care.

B004I2K4DY|5.0|I just received this for my 19th birthday (yesterday-- Jan. 3rd) and I automatically watched it. I love Les Miserables and previously saw the 10th Anniversary special, as well as the full length movie with Liam Neeson and read the book. Thanks to my mother, I was hooked. Unfortunately, I haven't seen it on Broadway, but one day I hope to.<br />Onto this. I read the back of it before watching it and noticed that Nick Jonas was in it and at first I wasn't too pleased just because I do not like the Jonas Brothers. I thought: 'oh great, this will be ruined'. But my opinion and respect for Nick Jonas automatically changed when I saw him as Marius. He was an incredible Marius. He sang beautifully, and was well into character. Definitely not the Disney stereotype at all, which is what I expected.  My respect grew even more when I found out that he always wanted to play Marius. It was a decent performance.<br />The cast and ensemble were incredible. Javert was amazing along with Jean Vajean (of course!). I was speechless at the end---this was beyond words the best thing I have ever seen. The best thing about this concert was the ending when the different casts from different productions came up, that made it worth wild and even more fun.<br />All Les Miserables fans will love this and will feel like they were actually there in the O2 theater!<br />Well worth it!
1451627289|1.0|A bit of sex a bit of violence a bit of nostalgia If this book had been half its length it would have been endurable As it was it just went on and on and on Most of it was just padding and pretty boring padding at that  A lot of reviewers have complained about the use of words such as \\"obdurate\\" At least I know those words or I could look them up in a dictionary I object to one or two syllable words that I had never heard of and neither had the dictionary  Don't buy this book

1451648537|3.0|I once meet a software programmer at a BBQ in Menlo Park (Silicon Valley) and he almost bragged to me how Steve Jobs chewed him out in front of everyone at a meeting. It was almost a badge of honor to him. I didn't understand it then as I didn't know much about Steve Jobs but after reading this book it makes sense now.   Anyhow, Steve Jobs is a very interesting person and has an amazing story- But this book reads as if it were rushed to print to capitalize on the timing of his death- The very opposite of what he stood for. Supposedly, this book was finished and drafted at the time of its release. Their are many errors, highly repeated statements & information, and scratching of the surface of events that you can't help but wonder who edited it. When I compare it to James Gleick's Genius (Richard Feynman biography) it pales in comparison. The book has some amazing parts that are well written but also has some parts that don't seem like much thought was put in. The last chapter was especially disappointing and a huge letdown.   If you know nothing about Steve Jobs at all or like reading easily digested pieces like People magazine this book is for you. Its not bad just not great- and nowhere near the perfectionism that Steve Jobs expected in a finished product.

B0068AWQQ2|4.0|I recently saw the original for the first time and, unfortunately, in this day and age its only redeeming point was Roddy McDowell.<br /><br />The storyline was re-written for the better and is a fun comedy/horror.  Rather than the vampire action being horrific, the serial killer type prisoner rooms provided the dab of horror for me.  David Tennant's character and his girlfriend, Gina, were hilarious.  It was a great role and they must have enjoyed it as much as the audience did.  To date, this is possibly the best I have seen Colin Farrel as the menacing next door vampire.  Toni Collette is a favorite of mine and I am glad the re-write managed to keep her from being the idiotic mom of the first film while still being the grounded adult of the film.  The young leads were ok but last on my list (same as the first film.)

0786891416|3.0|This book reminded me of the Da Vinci Code, a bit lacking in substance yet most other people seem to love it.  I think this is because I read a fair bit and for me it was way too light.  It is pretty much the script to an episode of Castle with the names changed.  I'm a fan of the TV show but just reading the script to the show doesn't give you the rich experience that all the visuals provide and the author of the book hasn't fleshed it out at all to compensate.  If you don't read a lot then its a fast paced book with a good plot.  It would make a good episode of Castle.
B0034G4P9E|5.0|I picked this up having heard a few positive things said about it on the web, but I didn't expect much more than some overly cliche drama and cool fights. I was pleasantly surprised with what is now one of my favorite films I've ever seen. First of all, those looking for some cool fights won't be disappointed. As someone who's done MMA I can say that while they aren't perfect, they do a great job of giving the \\"Spark Notes\\" version of the intesity and brutality that happen in the octagon.   However, the fights aren't what make this movie one that sticks with you. That honor would owe itself to the near perfect acting by everyone involved. Hardy does an amazing job of being a jerk and relatable at the same time. After seeing Warrior I now have no doubt that he'll be absolutely terrifying as Bane in The Dark Knight Rises later this year. The guy is seriously jacked, and portrays an unreal amount of animalistic brutality while still conveying human pain and emotion. Edgerton plays a fantastic yang to Hardy's Ying as the more cerebral and technical fighter that's also a much-loved chemistry teacher. Rounding out the main trifecta is Nolte with a flooring performance as the recovering drunk as a father. During certain scenes I literally just looked away and pondered how the heck he was pulling this off.  Please, I beg of you, don't dismiss this as \\"just another Rocky or The Fighter.\\" It isn't. I personally found Warrior more engaging and impacting than either of those also excellent pieces. The story may be convenient and unlikely in certain places, but there are so many layers of conflict and emotion swirling around at all times that somehow it all works.   I know a lot of people rate on a 1 or 5 star scale, with nothing ever in the middle, but believe that I didn't just give this film 5 stars to give the highest possible effect on the overall Amazon rating. I gave it 5 stars because I don't think that there's one thing about it I would change. I know that there isn't such a thing a perfect anything, but it's the closest I've seen a movie come in some time. Don't take my word for it. Watch Warrior and I'm sure you'll be glad you did.
B006470HZ6|2.0|What started out to be another outstanding show from AMC has turned into a boring, episodic soap opera, riddled with over-acting, unremarkable writing, and cheesy dialogue.  I don't know if one of the original producers of the show quit, but someone has taken what was a once a gripping, cinematic masterpiece and pushed it off a cliff.  I honestly don't see how this show will last beyond perhaps a 3rd Season if it continues in this direction.<br /><br />You have to go back and watch Season 1 to really appreciate how good the show started out compared to where the writers, producers and directors have taken it to now.  They should hire Vince Gilligan as a consultant because the writing and dialogue is just so unconvincingly bad.<br /><br />ETA:  I did a little digging and found out why the show took a nosedive.<br /><br />Frank Darbont was fired from the show over production costs!  No wonder the high production value of the 1st Season is such a high contrast to the budgeted soap opera of Season 2.  What a shame.<br /><br />As Anthony Ocasio of Screen Rant writes:<br /><br />\\"Even though The Walking Dead proved to be a hit - and it is the only series that AMC owns completely - the network had already announced to the producers that they would not only be cutting the budget of the series from $3.4 million to $2.7 million, but that they would also want 13 episodes produced instead of 6 episodes that made up its first season. To make matters worse, AMC also told the producers that the 30% tax credit that the series receives from filming in Georgia would go directly to the network, and not make up for some of the money that was taken out of the production budget.<br /><br />AMC's fiscal irresponsibility and their lack of appreciation for those who make The Walking Dead is largely what led to Darabont being fired. Originally taking the announcement of a second season budget cut in stride, the producers of the series decided to wait until the first season premiered. After The Walking Dead began breaking ratings records for the network, the producers assumed their budget wouldn't be cut as much as originally thought.\\"<br /><br />Unfortunately, this is exactly what happened - and Darabont wasn't too happy about it. Known as a man who fights for what he believes in, a confrontation between AMC and The Walking Dead producers occurred. With the head of original programming for AMC, Joel Stillerman, sticking to the cut budget, the network than began to overstep their bounds and attempt to tell Darabont how to produce the series.<br /><br />Instead of long, sprawling outdoor scenes, the network wanted the second season of The Walking Dead to occur 50% outdoors and 50% indoors (indoors being cheaper to film). Another note asked whether or not the audience had to always see the zombies - couldn't they simply hear them sometimes.\\"ork, the producers assumed their budget wouldn't be cut as much as originally thought.\\"  Unfortunately, this is exactly what happened - and Darabont wasn't too happy about it.

B000PMG16U|1.0|I won't get into the technical aspects of the movies but rather the watchability of them...  So how does a billionaire (G. Lucas) completely destroy the very foundation that gave him his fortune & put him on the map???? Answer: He makes the most pathetic  and expensive prequels in history. The only reason these movies made any impact was because they were riding the wave of the original StarWars movies made before them....and these movies squashed that wave....completely. Take a lesson George from some lower budget movies that had real heart and soul...like your 1st UN-remastered Star Wars movie!!!   -Prequel #1..... who was his target audience? It was certainly NOT the people who saw the original trilogy in the theaters back in the '70's and '80's. This movie was made for 10 year old kids and it was also the herald of the next two movies to come. Seriously George!.... a nine year old Annikan/Darth Vader that misses his mommy??......Little micro midiclorian things in the blood that give people their \\"force\\" powers? So much for the mysticism of the \\"force\\".... Going against what the original statements made about Yoda teaching Obi Wan..but now it is some other jedi that taught him?.....and Ja Ja Binks and his goofy people of exploding marble throwers. And the nine year old Annikan flying the space fighter into an enemy shielded ship, firing inside the ship, exploding the ship by firing inside the ship and thus winning the battle.....when all the OTHER battle tested, experienced pilots just couldn't figure out how to do that too?...yup, thank goodness for the nine year old with force buddies in his blood....he was truly a hero we could all feel for.  -Prequel #2..... one word....WHY?..... why Haden Christian for the lead roll???? The kid has the acting talent of a 3rd rate high school understudy! He was about as convincing in his roll as William Shatner singing \\"Rocket Man\\"...and just as enjoyable to watch.  His character was NOT a growing evil but he WAS a whiny little twerp that needed to be slapped upside the head. And where did you get the name \\"DOOKOO\\" for the main villan??!! Seriously George, STOP asking ur over fed, over indulged children for advice on how to make your movies!! It didn't work for the first prequel, it didn't work for this one either. This movie still seems like it was made for the kiddies. So much for the heart felt adventure and thrill of your Star Wars movies made in the 70' & 80's.  -Prequel #3.... aaaand again you brought back Hayden Christian even after all the complaints you received about him from, um, THE FANS! You remember the FANS, right George?... you know....the FANS,... the people who you are supposed to care about? The people that made you ...um....famous?...no?.... So now, the movie got a bit better. No more exploding marble throwing, goofy speaking, floppy eared characters.... just Hayden Christian's unconvincing persona & other characters that we the audience care little about. The main saving grace of the movie was Natalie Portman's performance. But, because of you and Hayden Christian's performance.... now and forever more, the toughest, biggest, bad guy of all time in movie land.... Darth Vader, has been reduced to nothing more than a whiny brat with in cape and a helmet.
B00377V6IS|4.0|This review has nothing to do with the album proper, which is worthy of more stars than we're allowed to give. My complaint here concerns the unnecessary decision to include a live track at the end of the original sequence. This disrupts the once-perfect ending at the close of the title track. If the label felt it had to include an unreleased track to justify the exorbitant price they're charging for this re-re-release, the least they could've done is include an unknown, studio-recorded track that actually compliments the original tracks.<br /><br />My other issue with this product is the sticker placed directly on the cover of the album, rather than on the outer wrapping. Whose idea was this? It won't come off without damaging the otherwise lovely packaging, making this edition less collectible than it was intended to be. What am I supposed to do? Use Goo Gone on a book?<br /><br />The original Blackwater Park deserves five stars, hands-down, but I feel that this presentation does not deserve such a rating.

B006DJ2JSI|5.0|Free, fast, and speaks! What else do you need! My Kindle Fire brought a dictionary pre-installed but its a failure. When I look up a word and it taks about 6 minutes to completely search the dictionary. It's so much easier with this app. I give it two thumbs up!

B005ZUR724|5.0|It's been many years since I played World of Warcraft, but after downloading and playing Order and Chaos Online the memories all flooded right back. It's not as deep, or as big, as WoW, but for the price is still fairly amazing, and gives you a truly authentic MMORPG experience on your device of choice. I'm not too far into the game, but already know that I'll be pumping many hours into it in the near future.  I mainly wanted to write this review because this games review score got massacred during what was about a 3-4 day game outage due to what I believe was some type of issue with an update, which resulted in many frustrated gamers hitting it with poor scores. But letting that dissuade you from buying this game would be doing yourself a great disservice, for this truly is a fantastic game.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Okay Star Wars blu-ray set 1-6.Excellent in my opinion.I saw the first Star Wars when I was 14 and I've been a fan ever since.Empire Strikes Back is my favorite.The outtakes and scene demos are awesome.I believe this is a must for die hard fans.About 65-90 dollars depending where you shop.
B005GVF95O|5.0|But wow, is it adorable! Perfect for kids. Anyone complaining about &quot;wasting&quot; the FAotD on something like this needs to reevaluate their own priorities. Entilement complex, much?   It's a rather unfortunate fact that kids are getting phones at a younger and younger age. Not that anyone in the demographic for this game would have a phone yet (at least I hope not!), but the fact that many kids do have phones or tabs capable of running things like this is something we all need to get used to. The &quot;age requirement&quot; is not going to get any higher!
0345444051|5.0|A master piece written by one of the godfathers of sci-fi, Childhood's End follows a peaceful alien invasion of Earth resulting in a near-utopia. The novel touches on several thought provoking subjects such as the imposed transcendence of the human life form and beckons the question: \\"What if human no longer suffered from ignorance?\\". Written in and partially set in the 50's, Clark's vision of the future remains novel and applicable to our present now.

0756655307|5.0|Gave this to my fiancee as a Christmas gift since he is a big comic book fan. Needless to say, he loves it! It's well set out, and lists even the most minor of characters. The only problem now is that my fiancee keeps suggesting Marvel character names for our unborn baby...
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This was the first Stephen King book I had ever read, mostly, because I don't care for horror.  When I read the reviews on this book I couldn't resist.  He is an incredible author who has written a book with a great plot.  Some reviewers I noticed thought he could have shortened the middle of the book, I disagree.  Those years from 1958 to 1963 were years I married and had kids. I loved the book and I'm so glad I had it on Kindle.  At my age it would had been a burden to hold such a big book.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I like the different ways to play. I also like how you. an customize your card cover and how many cards come out like 1 or 3 and the different styles you can play.
B00138CT16|5.0|I don't know if I have heard any soundtrack that is as perfect as this one. One moment powerful and majestic, and in another tense and foreboding. Barry uses the perfect blend of military marches, sweeping majestic violin laden themes and Americana laced movements that reminds one of the classical/popular blend of George Gershwin to achieve this masterpiece. Dances With Wolves won over half of the 11 Academy Awards it was nominated for including Best Soundtrack. The music, I believe, had a lot to do with all that acclaim. Even if you haven't seen the movie, you owe it to yourself to take a listen. You'll probably be hooked like me and many others, enjoying it for decades to come.

B005HI4LLY|5.0|One of the best horror films of all time was SHAUN OF THE DEAD.  It wasn't the first horror comedy (I will always have a soft spot in my heart for LOVE AT FIRST BITE and Roger Corman's LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS), but its success inspired studios to combine two genres haphazardly.  Like various chemicals, horror and comedy work amazingly well when combined in the right proportions; but when mixed wrongly, the concoction tends to explode in your face.<br /><br />TUCKER AND DALE VS. EVIL is definitely a successful mixture.  The film follows the lovable oaf Dale (Tyler Labine, SONS OF TUSCON), and his good pal Tucker (Alan Tudyk, SERENITY), as they head out to the country their fixer-upper \\"vacation home.\\"  It's a dream come true!  Except for the bigoted college kids who have a very similar idea.  One of the beautiful coeds (Katrina Bowden, 30 ROCK) slips and hurts her head; when Dale and Tucker rescue her, her friends get the wrong idea and scatter into the woods.  They begin to plot their revenge; but what they can't plan for is the fact that stupidity is a two-edged sword.<br /><br />There's a reason I referred to the characters as \\"Dale and Tucker\\" and not the other way around: this is Labine's film, and he carries it admirably.  Tudyk is great, too, and Bowden is spectacular (for those of us who only know her from her limited 30 ROCK role).  Of the other kids, Jesse Moss--as the devolving Chad--is the standout.  Eli Craig's directing is very sure-handed, considering it's his first time out, and the script is rock-solid: very subtle, very very funny if you pay close attention.  There's heaping handfuls of gore thrown on top of everything, and just enough of a dark edge to make it interesting.  (Don't worry: it never gets so dark that you stop laughing.  You'll think it's heading there, but it isn't.)  TUCKER AND DALE VS. EVIL is, hands down, one of the best (in fact, one of only a few good) horror/comedies to be released recently.  If you're a fan of the genre, check it out and have your faith redeemed.faith redeemed.

B003PGNBO8|4.0|I learned 3/4 into the season that ABC was not going to renew Flash Forward for a second season. After eventually calming myself, I came to terms with it. I would buy the solo season, and think of it as a 22 hour mini series. However, I finally watched it in its entirety. I expected closer, since it was ending. Wrong-o. It ends as there is going to be another season. Not one question was answered, you have no idea what happens with the characters. Maybe if someone would write a fake ending for me I would be okay. Like JK Rowling did for Harry Potter. However, the show itself was AMAZING.
B004XZR63M|4.0|knowledge is power, im only half way through the book, and i want to say that i've learn a lot from it already, i feel like he should have more information instead of having so much personal experiences.

0061120073|5.0|Every year I think about rereading books I loved when I was younger. Every year or two I'll reread \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" or I'll take another read of \\"Camille\\". It's like getting back together with a old friend and I always feel better after.<br /><br />Now these two books I've read rather consistently since I first fell in love with them but others I loved in High School and earlier I haven't read in years and in some cases decades. An example of that is \\"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn\\". I don't think I've read it in 20 years or more. This month my book club decided to \\"A Tree\\" and I realized I haven't read it forever. But I began to get nervous that I wouldn't love it the way I did when I first read it.<br /><br />Well, I didn't have to worry. It was everything I remembered it being. Francie Nolan and her family live in turn of the century Brooklyn. Poverty and cruelty is everywhere yet the Nolan family they're family and neighbors work hard to simply live, an accomplishment in itself. Francie's father Johnny is a lovable entertaining man who drinks to much and finds it hard to grow up and take care of his family the way he should. The job of providing for the family falls to Katie Nolan, Francie's mother. Katie works hard to earn money and take care of her family and also pushes each of her children to get an education, knowing it's the only way they will ever escape life in the tenements of Brooklyn.<br /><br />A vivid picture of a time and place that doesn't exist anymore \\"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn\\" is, at heart, the story of how one little girl, with the help of those who love her, survives with hope and a remarkable resilience that makes you root for her to become everything she hopes to be.<br /><br />I loved this book so much. The old chestnut of \\"I Laughed, I cried\\" really does fit this book. I think one of the things that struck me most is how fast children had to grow up in those conditions. We talk today about how fast our kids grow up but it seems nothing in comparison to that way children had to fight to survive in this time period. Children went to work to support their family and while I'm sure it still exists I wonder if it is prevalent. Just with the child labor laws it must be different.<br /><br />The hope that flows through this story is what really touched me. I truly believe Francie would be one who made it out but unlike others shown in the story who made it out and turned their backs on their life in Brooklyn you're left knowing Francie would never forget or hate her past life. Thanks to the love and support of all her family Francie would never really leave Brooklyn.fight to survive in this time period.

B0054JZC6E|4.0|overall not a bad app at all. it provides a good and large amount of entertainment without having any major catches or expansions that need to be bought with real money.
B004UUKDNA|3.0|The debut by Foster The People rides mainly ion the skills of lead singer/songwriter Mark Foster, who has found the way to homogenize the sound of indie and dance for his \\"Torches.\\" He's got a knack for ear-worm choruses, already made unavoidable by the all-summer-long pervasiveness of \\"Pumped Up Kicks,\\" and \\"Don't Stop.\\" The music has an effervescence to it, which is interesting if you consider that \\"Kicks\\" is a song about a shooting spree.<br /><br />That is what makes \\"Torches\\" both promising, interesting and frustrating. Mark sings in a Bee Gees helium voice, which keeps the music buzzy and floaty. There isn't much by way of depth, but there's loads of tart candy to be had. The opening of \\"Helana Beat\\" had me thinking Donna Summer and popped up on my I-Pod's random play. There's no way to deny it, \\"Foster The People\\" are a solid pop band that is currently rolling in some hipster cred. The question is going to be if they can lift themselves to the pop creativity of, say, Adam Levine/Maroon 5 or if \\"Pumped Up Kicks\\" is this year's MGMT and \\"Kids.\\"

B006C1DH92|4.0|A lot of fun, but I find the achievement notifications annoying, since they take up a third of the field.   Snappy on Thunderbolt, slightly laggy or lacking in sensitivity on Gtab, though the description says not optimized for tablets so I can't knock it for that. Both devices running CM7.
B0063IH60K|4.0|It does what it's supposed to. I don't get the winning hand thing but whatever. Can't best free. The occasional adds for Spider solitaire and what not are a small annoyance.
0439023513|5.0|To try not to spoil anything for anyone who's not read the book, let me just say that the ending it not what I initially expected.  I was expecting a little more romance, but that is not what this book is about.  The characters have changed since the first two books, so don't expect to see the same sort of relationship.  When I first finished the book, I had a sense of letdown.  I kept thinking about it, and decided to reread the last chapter.  In doing so, I was able to fully appreciate the ending.  It is realistic.  War changes people.  It's just a fact of life.  It would be unrealistic for the characters to experience war and then to pick up right where they left off before the warn began.  Anyway, after giving the ending much thought, I've come to my own conclusion that the ending is perfect just the way it is.
B0034G4P94|4.0|I thought this movie was great, the fighting is as good as it gets. The 3 leads are excellent and by the end you don't know who to root for. I guess if I had to be critical, I would have wanted to see more of the backstory that caused the strained relations with their father. Overall, very very solid movie.

0446547654|2.0|I was highly disappointed with the novel. The plot was very similar to that of The Notebook. I felt I was reading a present day Notebook with a highly predictable twist at the end. I usually LOVE any work by Nicholas Sparks. This one however fell very flat. I will say I couldn't put it down but only because I was hoping it would get better. However, it only got worse. I hope this isn't a new trend for him. I really love his work. Better luck next time Mr. Sparks.

B003629IPW|1.0|I bought this 2 disc version because I liked the HBO broadcast so much. Much to my disappointment, when we played the disc, it sounded horrible. It was very muffled and the sound was not crisp at all. It almost sounded like a 3rd or 4th generation recording. I thought maybe that my sound system was the problem, so I played the Lady GaGa DVD that I purchased on the same order and it sounded great. The only thing I can say is, I only paid $5.00 for this 2 disc pack. I should have known that you get what you pay for.
B004LROUNG|5.0|I was thrilled to read this book and discover that Grisham has gone back to his roots of writing legal thrillers, and this one doesn't disappoint!! From the very beginning, he describes the characters in such detail that it pulls you right into the story.  I couldn't put this book down.  It has his normal twists and turns of a great thriller and is a wonderful addition to your library!! If you enjoyed the old style Grisham legal thrillers, this book is for you!

B005OK725M|4.0|I was not expecting a big movie, but I was truly surprised.  I thought the plot was pretty good and the action was explosive. I have not bought DVD's in a long while, but this one surely will be on my shelf by the end of this week. I put it up there next to Salt, not above it, but next too it.  Colombiana was way better than Hanna, which was a bore and should have never seen the light of day. Zoe protrayed the part to a \\"T\\", and I look forward to seeing her do some more action pictures in the future. So, grab some popcorn and strap in for an awesome ride through Colombiana!

B00023B1A8|5.0|This would have been a wonderful concert to have been in attendance. It shows CSN as originally envisioned: a semi-acoustic trio with unmatched vocal harmonies. Actually, this was how Crosby and Nash wanted to present themselves when they first started performing but Stills knew they needed to \\"rock and roll\\" as well. When they first started playing for anyone who would hear them it was in this format, three voices and a couple of acoustic guitars. So, in this regard this concert gets as close to the original product as possible. One can always nit pick, of course, and I wish they had performed more songs from 1977's CSN (my favorite CSN album) and dispensed with the solo performances. If you are a CSN fan this DVD is a must own. I would disregard the scattered negative reviews here as they range from pointless to silly: Graham Nash fat???
B005GVF95O|5.0|My kid loves it, had the free version previously, I'm glad that Amazon gives away this kind of apps for free also. 5*

B0009P5YXO|3.0|I was so excited when I knew my sonic screw driver was at my door step. It was awesome and bigger than I expected when I first opened it, but as I opened it something seemed off. I plugged in the batteries and triple checked that they were correct and then I pressed the button. And disappointment, there was no sound at all coming out. Light was bright and the batteries were in correctly, but no sound. There isn't a point to buying a sonic screwdriver that doesn't had that trademark sound. In other words in very disappointed :(
0321647440|1.0|I was very disappointed in this training course.  My first objection was the photo library required the latest version of iPhoto to use the photos in training. The latest version of iPhoto requires OS-10.6.  My computer is not compatible with 10.6. It would require the purchase of a new computer and new iPhoto program ($$$$$$) Therefore you couldn't follow the exact training to see the results on the photos.    I purchased the training to help with the preparation of books. The section on books was very disappointing with only a overview of the process, most of which I had already found out by trial and error.  There was no help is solving problems.  THAT WAS THE PROBLEM WITH THE TRAINING COURSE.  It was just a overview of the basics of using Aperture 3.  If you have a problem, YOU ARE ON YOUR OWN!
B005GVF95O|5.0|My kids and I love this game.  I thought it was going to be one big piece to put in, but instead it is a few pieces.  Excellent and good skills for kids to learn.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|There are a lot of games here I just don't like, but there are some okay. I like the concept.
B005HI4LMS|3.0|Okay, so not sure this is a movie I would necessarily add to my collection, but it is certainly worth a watch.  A fairly good horror comedy, though titles such as Scary Movie, Zombieland, and Shaun of the Dead are much better in my opinion.  Kind cheesy, but was a good spin off slasher movies and had some good laughs in it, but I would recommend just renting this one or adding to your Netflix cue.
B005TPCQ5I|2.0|Good happens again, then Spoiler....are you serious, the protagonist dies like that!!! Why would anyone want to see a movie this sad? I watch this crap on the news all time, I want movies to be entertaining. Sorry I thought this was a downer.

B005V2EVBQ|4.0|This cover protects the Kindle Fire well and fits like a glove.  The band makes sure that it is closed and stays closed if dropped.  The Kindle Fire does not bulk up with the cover so it is still easy to slide in the pocketbook with out it catching anything.  Also makes the kindle fire a low profile items so prying eyes do not know what it is. You can fold the cover up to make the stand very easly.  Now, just have to use it and give it the test of time to see how it holds up.
B005PTQPU0|4.0|Kate Bush has never really repeated herself in her shockingly varied career, but neither has she produced something so completely off the charts different from her previous work as \\"50 Words For Snow.\\" Where most of her albums contained shorter pop-length songs between three to six minutes, the shortest song on \\"50 Words\\" clocks in at 6:49. The longest one endures for 13:32. An only slighter shorter magnum opus tops 11 minutes. Clearly, she wanted to accomplish something different here with a mere eight songs of hulking length.<br /><br />Then the album's overall feeling: brooding, somewhat claustrophobic, slow and almost methodical. No one would dance their legs off to this album. \\"50 Words\\" qualifies as \\"mood music\\" and stands across a deep chasm from party music. As such, the songs inspire introspection and reflection, but in a more sedentary way than her other work. Even the vocal melodies seem restrained, except for her son's choir boy flourishes in the first song and a few other moments. Perhaps this all relates to the theme of winter, as the album also has a cold aura to it. Bush's voice even seems to shiver subtly in places. Winter inspires self-reflection mostly since the season tends to pass indoors, often in isolation from the big old world. The album arguably feels like a cold winter night spent alone. The extended length of the songs also give a sense of time passing slowly. In short, this is an album to get moody to.<br /><br />A fairly familiar sounding Bush-esque piano riff opens the album with a flutter. It evolves into a softly pounding musical mantra that undertows the entire song. Most of the songs revolve and layer around simple themes in this way. This first song, \\"Snowflake,\\" presents the world from the point of view of a falling and drifting snowflake, or maybe a snowflake-ified spirit, with a personal touch. The snowflake seems to have a purpose in mind, repeating \\"I'll find you.\\" Gorgeous and haunting vocal harmonies bubble up from bells and piano to begin the chilling \\"Lake Tahoe.\\" Here the ghost of a woman rises from the lake and shouts for her lost dog Snowflake. Perhaps this reference ties first two songs together. \\"Misty\\" seems to relate an illicit affair with a snowman, but provides an apt metaphor for fading, in this case melting, love. The album's stand out track remains \\"Wild Man.\\" It's the most dynamic and familiarly Kate Bush song on the album. One could even dance to it, a little. Here the song's narrator seems to warn a Yeti-like creature that people want to kill it. References to Tibet and India, such as Lhakpa La, Garo Hills, Dipu Marak, Annapurna, complete the scene and the story. From here the album goes a little awry. Though \\"Snowed In At Wheeler Street\\" keeps the album's mood, it doesn't quite work as well and feels more formulaic than the other songs, despite Elton John's presence. And the biggest paradox remains the title track and the album's weakest song. Here Stephen Fry's great voice reads 50 words for snow while Bush counts down and eggs him on in the somewhat corny chorus. The only thing worse may be the cover art. Thankfully, \\"Among Angels\\" rescues the show with a poignant performance by Bush and piano. A great ending.<br /><br />\\"50 Words For Snow\\" won't please everyone, nor does it qualify as her absolutely best work. For some, the argument that many of the songs are just too long will remain tempting. They are long. Also, the mood differs so much from her other work that people hoping for another \\"Aerial\\" or \\"Red Shoes\\" will doubtlessly lose interest fast. Bush took some risks with this album. Not everyone will like the results. Others will drift and gently bob in the floating, sparse and hypnotic rhythms while mellowing out and reflecting on whatever comes to mind. What some may find boring others may find relaxing. In any case, credit goes to Bush for bold experimentation. She's created a small collection of nearly symphonic songs that will alienate some and ingratiateothers. And that's what a lot of challenging creative work does in the end. Listeners are left to choose for themselves.of challenging creative work does in the end. Listeners are left to choose for themselves.
1401922414|2.0|I like to start the day with uplifting words and thoughts, so I keep a daily calendar with inspiring quotations or thoughts in the bathroom.    While the title of this item, \\"I can do it\\" promises inspiration, the contents are trite.    \\"I look upon my past, present and future with love\\" offers no insight, no inspiration. \\"I am dancing on air because life loves me\\" is simply an empty thought.    Perhaps here are people who find this inspiring. I don't.  Jerry
B005VEQR0W|5.0|I was a little skeptical having read on forums mixed views on this disc. I have the MFSL gold disc and compared it to this SACD. No question that the SACD is warmer and has more presence to it. I listened to both discs several times and am really glad I purchased the SACD. Here's hoping that Analogue Productions remasters Teaser and the Firecat :)
0761129235|5.0|While doing research for my upcoming book \\"[[ASIN:1439872961 Healthcare Kaizen: Engaging Front-Line Staff in Sustainable Improvements]],\\" I found two books that touched on kaizen-style continuous improvement in our everyday lives -- one was this book with a more intensive and clinical look at kaizen, One Small Step Can Change Your Life: The Kaizen Way by Robert Maurer PhD, a professor of behavioral sciences at UCLA.<br /><br />I finally read all of Maurer's book, in one sitting while traveling late last year, and I really enjoyed it. I'd like to share a formal review here.<br /><br />Maurer, in introducing kaizen (translated from Japanese as \\"continuous improvement\\"), cites the original Training Within Industry program, Dr. W. Edwards Deming (Maurer's initial exposure to the principles of kaizen) and Toyota's Taiichi Ohno and he describes the impact this approach had for Toyota and others in industry. Maurer, in his book, is translating and adapting kaizen principles to issues in the realm of clinical counseling and his patients, with problems including:<br /><br />Wanting to quit smoking<br />Needing to exercise more<br />Desiring to eat better<br />Wanting to floss daily<br />Becoming more appreciative of one's spouse<br /><br />Ironically, there are some lessons from the clinical realm that we can, I think, bring back to the workplace.<br /><br />Maurer writes of Julie, a patient who wanted (needed) to exercise more. Traditional advice would be to ask her to launch immediately into some big fancy exercise program that, since it seemed overwhelming, might not even get started (or might not sustain) -- sounds familiar to big programmatic approaches to workplace improvement, right?<br /><br />Maurer's advice:<br /><br />\\"How about if you just march in place in front of the television, each day, for one minute?\\"<br /><br />Maurer writes about how the human brain, the prehistoric part called the amygdala, is programmed to exhibit a \\"fight or flight\\" response. When this happens, our higher-level cognitive thinking is shut off. This is a helpful survival instinct when we are in real physical danger, but it's less helpful when this response is triggered by a change or a new situation at work or in our daily life.<br /><br />Maurer suggests that small baby steps changes, as we use in workplace kaizen, circumvent the amygdala because small changes aren't overwhelming or scary. He asked Julie to just march one minute... and then the entire commercial break, then two. Eventually, Julie was exercising for extended periods of time.<br /><br />From the book:<br /><br />I noticed that Julie's attitude had changed. Instead of coming back discouraged, as so many failed exercisers do, Julie was more animated, with less resistance in her speech and demeanor....<br /><br />and his patients would say:<br /><br />\\"The steps were so small I couldn't fail!\\"<br /><br />Maurer suggests a similar path when trying to cut out sweets from your diet. Instead of going \\"cold turkey,\\" break off the first bite and throw it in the trash. You are taking a positive first step to weaning yourself off of candy. Combined with positive thoughts and encouragement, these baby steps can lead to larger, sustained changes.<br /><br />Rather than fighting our nature, Maurer suggests we embrace our natural reactions:<br /><br />\\"During the rough patches, understanding that fear is normal, and a natural sign of ambition, makes us more likely to hold on to hope and optimism-qualities.\\"<br /><br />Now you might be thinking that small gradual improvements are fine, but we also need innovation (a trendy business buzzword). Maurer says there is certainly a place for larger innovation, but we also need smaller continuous improvements. That's a theme that is consistent with our Healthcare Kaizen book.<br /><br />Maurer writes that the reason behavioral kaizen works is that:<br /><br />kaizen approach is a highly effective method of building new neural connections in the brain...<br /><br />What is a new workplace habit, related to Lean or otherwise, that you have wanted to start, but you didn't because it seemed too overwhelming? Let's say your Lean consultant said you need to do an hour-long Gemba walk every day. You don't have time for that... so it doesn't happen and you get discouraged. It's easier to be resigned to saying, \\"See, Lean won't work here.\\"<br /><br />But what if you followed the Maurer kaizen path and started with a 5-minute gemba walk. That's easier to squeeze into your day, perhaps. Start small, reinforce the behavior, and you might gradually start enjoying the gemba walks to the point when you are now making time to make them happen.<br /><br />Maurer also has tips and lessons about rewiring one's brain for kaizen and changes, including leading yourself and others by asking small questions, such as \\"What's the smallest step I can take to be more efficient?\\", learning to practice this habit in a kaizen style by starting small...<br /><br />The author shares key positive questions we can ask ourselves, including:<br /><br />If I were guaranteed not to fail, what would I be doing differently?<br /><br />And, if you're trying to reach a goal (personal or workplace related):<br /><br />What is one small step I could take toward reaching my goal?<br /><br />To work toward successful change in the personal realm, Maurer also writes that we need to unlearn some deeply engrained notions, including the cultural teachings, including:<br /><br />\\"...change must always be instantaneous, it must always require steely self-discipline, and it must never be pleasurable.\\"<br />\\"self-reliance is a frequently used but very poor strategy for coping with life's adversity. That's because we are biologically \\"wired\\" to reach out for support when we're stressed; it's in our nature.\\"<br />Later in the book, Maurer creates an interesting twist, as the kaizen principles (originating in the workplace) are brought BACK into the workplace, as he described how staff at a medical clinic really turned around their operations and became successful through these same ideas he had used with his patients. It all comes full circle.<br /><br />Maurer also makes a great case for how we start, with kaizen, by learning how to see and address little problems. Then, we are able to see and fix larger problems. I know that has been the experience in hospitals that are using kaizen methods. We write a lot about small problems and small improvements in our book, but that's the starting point. There will always be little problems even as we start fixing the bigger, more systemic stuff.<br /><br />All in all, I found this an enjoyable and thought-provoking read - for my personal life and in the professional realm. I'm not big on \\"self help\\" books, but Maurer's translation of kaizen to the personal realm was a fresh take on continuous improvement. There are ideas in this book that we can all apply to our New Year's resolutions or other improvements we hope to make.r /><br />What is a new workplace habit, related to Lean or otherwise, that you have wanted to start, but you didn't because it seemed too overwhelming?

B004LROUW2|5.0|This book requires a considerable commitment. Some 900 plus pages.  I finished last evening.  When I did, I was sad to close my Kindle and rejoin the world I (think) I know best.  As some reviewers have noted, Murakami is a magician.  His prose (if I can speak of this translation) is sparse despite the vast length of this novel.  I found it an immensely satisfying read. Sort of a Stieg Larsson meats Margaret Atwood experience, if that makes sense.  The characters are all extraordinarily well developed.  Their respective mysteries unfold gradually across the vast sweep of the novel.  Nothing is at it seems.  And yet everything it seems is just as it is.  I apologize for the vagueness of my review. But I don't want to give away too much.  Let other reviewers do as they wish.  My recommendation is this: If you have the time to commit to this magnificent work, you won't be disappointed.  Enjoy!
1401310400|5.0|This book reads just like an episode of the TV show, and you can easily hear the character voices as \\"Richard Castle\\" obviously based them all on the detectives he works with on a daily basis. Heat Wave is the episode you've been dying to see, but probably never will.

When the blu-ray arrived, I didn't hesitate to replace the original.  I gave my first to my brother.  He is a collector and has 5X as many dvd's as I.  He loved the movie.  This is a hidden treasure if you like sci-fi.  I highly recommend the purchase.
B0042J6VUS|1.0|Well sometimes as we all know you get what you pay for, and this is definitely the case. The spring for the holder is very tight, which worked against the unit. The way the adjustable spring loaded arm is held in place isn't very durable and will no longer stay attached after only a couple of uses.  Also the screw whole is deeper then most and therefore some tripod screws can't catch enough threads to hold it on.  I just ordered the [[ASIN:B006CSGV98 F-S(B): i.Trek SUPER MOUNT F, Metal Tripod Adapter for iPhone 3/4/4S iPad 1/2 iPod Touch HTC Samsung LG Motorola Android Smartphones and tablets (Blue, Short)]], which is inexpensive but very durable, and had great reviews. I'm hoping the i.Trek will be my solution.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|NO SPOILERS<br /><br />This short-lived show has a very loyal fan base.  After watching the series I can see why.  The characters are very engaging and Josh Whedon works his magic by really making it come alive.<br /><br />The show is all about rooting for the little guys and the underdogs as they try to survive against an aggressive interplanetary government with limited resources.<br /><br />It may sound strange, but you could almost classify this show as \\"western, sci-fy\\".<br /><br />After watching the series you may find yourself in the same predicament as so many others; wishing and hoping that Josh Whedon and the cast could magically get back together and carry on where the show left off!

B005K0HDGE|5.0|I haven't read a Steven King book in years because I outgrew the horror genre. I always loved his style, but the subject matter was just not appealing to me any longer. When I read the premise of 11/22/63 I found it intriguing, but then when the reviews started coming in I took the plunge. This was by far the best book I've read in years. True to King it was long, but I never found myself bored. The characters were very clearly drawn and I found myself loving not only Jake but also Miz Mimi, Mike Coslaw and especially Sadie! It's also a book that makes you think. Even if time travel were possible, is the past something that should be changed? I will definitely look deeper into King's work again now, especially if he has branched away from horror! You can't go wrong with this book!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Although I am a bookworm I had a hard time reading the Bible on a regular basis. This app reminds me when it is time to read. If I want it to, it recalculates the reading plans to catch up if I fall behind or get ahead, it can read out loud to me. I totally love the King James audio version. I can read in Spanish and English. Great search features, notes, and I can download to use in church. I fell in love with the Bible once again. Thank God for this app.

B0064W65UM|4.0|V For Vendetta is a great story. I own the special edition DVD of the movie, as well as the paperback edition of the book. When I received my Kindle Fire for Christmas, I couldn't wait to get my hands on some graphic novels on a beautiful full-color display, and V For Vendetta was right at the top of my list. However, when I downloaded it, it only displays the cover art. None of the eBook's images are displaying correctly, showing only blank whites pages with text in the upper-left hand corner that says \\"VforVendetta_(Page_01)\\"... This only seems to be the case with Kindle Fire graphic novels outside of Comixology, since every comic/graphic novel within that app works great; however, I also downloaded the sample for Alan Moore's \\"Watchmen\\", which has the very same issue. This must be fixed ASAP or I will be seeking a refund for this book. It's a shame; such a great graphic novel shouldn't be brought down by the bugginess of its platform. Overall, I give this 3 stars - the average between 5 for the graphic novel itself and 1 for the functionality.  EDIT: After contacting Tech Support via chat, I found out that all I had to do was perform a factory reset. It now functions with no problems. However, the issue still happened. Re-editing to 4 stars.

1451627289|3.0|I admit to buying whatever the NY Times tells me to buy, and so I accept the blame when something goes terribly wrong.  However, if just one person is saved from making the same mistake with 11/22/63, this review will have been worth writing.  According to King, borrowing from Norman Mailer, the most appalling aspect of the Kennedy assassination is the apparent randomness in the universe that allowed an insignificant man to accomplish an unthinkably powerful, destructive act.  So far, so good.  However, the problem for me in 11/22/63 (and King's other books) stems from King's reliance on mysticism, hunches, harmonies, coincidences, fate, etc., to not only advance the plot, but as the premise for the plot, as the source of various conflicts and obstacles, and then as the resolution to those same issues.  This is the definition of arbitrary.  For example, if the Past is \\"obdurate\\" enough to shatter the wheel of the hero's car en route to prevent the assassination, why would the Past provide another conveniently parked car with the keys practically hanging from the mirror?  King's answer is that the past \\"harmonizes.\\"  My thinking is that the Past could save a lot of trouble by not shattering the wheel in the first place.  A much simpler answer that has the benefit of making sense is that the Past operates in this contradictory manner for the purpose of contriving a moderately entertaining action sequence at the end of a novel.  The randomness of the Kennedy assassination accounts for its fascination, but the same meaninglessness in 11/22/63 is silly.  The difference is that we absolutely know that the first story took place, but it's King's job to convince us that the second story did.  If you already like Stephen King, 11/22/63 will probably not disappoint.  But, that doesn't mean that the NY Times should recommend it as one of the top five books of 2011!

B004A8ZWXS|3.0|*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />Rating: 3.5<br /><br />As with most Spielberg films, the eye catching visuals, usually outweigh the dramatics. That includes 'War Horse', originally a short children's novel, later turned into a superb stage play involving life-sized puppets. 'War Horse' is full of masterful visual scenes that are up there with some of the classic scenes in cinematic history.<br /><br />The two scenes that really stick in my mind are the cavalry charge and Joey's solo run through the battlefield. It's a real twist when Spielberg has the British instead of the Germans as the aggressors, leading a cavalry charge on seemingly unsuspecting German troops. What Spielberg suggests here is that in the 'pointless' war that was World War I, even the 'good guys' could be just as 'bad' as the 'bad guys'. Not only do the British come off as bloodthirsty but also incompetent, as obviously they have been provided with faulty intelligence and end up roundly defeated when they and their horses run into a nest of German machine gunners. As the camera pulls back, the full horror of the war is depicted not in shots of bloody soldiers but in the massacre of gentle cavalry horses.<br /><br />The horror of the war becomes even more 'up close and personal', when Spielberg focuses on the fate of Joey, the horse raised in the English countryside by Albert Narracott, the young teenage protagonist, who later loses his beloved steed to the Army, after his father is forced to sell the graceful animal, to save the family farm. With minimal CGI effects, we follow Joey as he runs riderless on the battlefield, dodging countless explosions from both artillery and sniper fire. When Joey ends up tangled in barbed wire, man's inhumanity to man is illustrated through the suffering of an innocent equine. But Spielberg also believes in a message of hope, for Joey is soon to be extricated from his wiry imprisonment, by a German and British soldier, who come out of their trenches, after a momentary truce is declared.<br /><br />It would be impossible to evaluate 'War Horse' without also referring to the stage play which the film is primarily based on. In the stage play, Joey's father, Ted, is pitted against his own brother and their conflict feels much more elemental, than the toothless rivalry between the father and his landlord, as depicted in the film. The film's screenwriters also failed to utilize an assortment of local gentry, characters in the community which add to the verisimilitude of an English village on the eve of World War I. I also recall that the stage play had some wonderful songs sung by the colorful locals--there were a couple of particularly moving musical scenes, when the men go off to war and especially when Albert returns with Joey, after the Armistice is declared.<br /><br />Spielberg's other mistake is to hit us over the head with his anti-war theme. The brilliant and detailed battle scenes are not enough for Spielberg; he's got to throw in two unnecessary subplots to drive his point home further. Those include the two young German deserters who meet an untimely end by way of firing squad and a French grandfather and sickly daughter, who briefly hide Joey and another war horse, Topthorn, from German soldiers, who eventually discover them and haul them off for further unwelcome battle service.<br /><br />Spielberg wisely duplicates the dramatic and emotional reunion between Albert and Joey found in the novel and stage play. In the play, Albert makes a triumphant return with Joey to his village and is celebrated in song by his community. In the film, however, there's the unnecessary diversion of the French grandfather purchasing Joey, before changing his mind and giving Joey back to Albert. Some may find that the grandfather's act of great generosity is an effective wrap up for 'War Horse', but for me, the true climax occurs when Albert finds Joey and prevents him from being put down.<br /><br />Finally, Albert's reunion with his father in the film, is not as moving or dramatic as what happens on stage. Unfortunately, 'Ted' is such a morose character in the film, that we hardly can care when he bonds with his son at film's end. Likewise, Jeremy Irvine, doesn't quite have the gravitas to pull off the role of Albert as Seth Numrich did, in the Broadway production at the Vivian Beaumont Theater in New York.<br /><br />'War Horse' is about one half hour too long. But this is Spielberg, and who's going to tell the \\"maestro\\", that his fine film needs a little bit of judicious editing? Nonetheless, 'War Horse' is still an impressive achievement especially in regards to some brilliant cinematography and staging of battle scenes, which relied little on artificial, computer generated special effects.ppens on stage.

159420229X|4.0|Not sure that I'd really want to go through all the practice and skills it takes to be a memory champion but this is an informative and entertaining read.  I did try a few of the concepts including the memory palace ---It works!  I liked the author's balance of different techniques of study intermingled with why we forget certain information.  I am not reading this in one big gulp and I encourage people to read it by chapter and try a few of the techniques to experience a smidgen of what the man went through during his year of study.  I work in elementary education and encounter many students with memory issues, perhaps some of these ideas would come in handy for kids studying mulitplication facts-----it also makes one question how immediate access to data in our technological world  affects our motivation and ability to retain information and is it a positive way to evolve or not.  Whatever your opinion is, it might be worth your time to read Foer's book.

I agree with other reviewers that the sound on the remastered CDs is worth having, even if one already has the entire Rush library.  However, the A Farewell to Kings DVD-Audio just won't play in one of my universal disk players, period (loads the menu, freezes before music starts, has to be powered down to eject), and in the other, selecting the surround sound version plays only the stereo tracks (mis-menu'd?).  It also does seem that the stereo track doesn't have all of the tracks in it, thus I believe it is just the two front channels of the surround mix.  Don't people try their own products before releasing them?  I haven't tried it, but I will take others' word for it that the Fly By Night CD may also be problematic (the DVD-Audio of this title works fine, sounds fantastic).  Definitely worth having; they just need to move FASTER to fix the glitches.

B000OP1M6M|5.0|Intro:<br /><br />In my opinion if you like dive watches, this model is a must have.  Dive watches aren't just for diving, they make the best beater watches because they are built extra tough and the Seiko line of dive watches are built extra-extra tough.<br /><br />Watch Model:<br /><br />The watch being reviewed is the SKX009K2 which is the blue dialed pepsi bezel version.  There is another model called the SKX007K2 that has a black dial and black bezel.  When searching for this watch, you will also see a model SKX175 listed that looks identical to the SKX009.  This model number designates the model that was for the American market and the only difference is some of the markings on the case-back.<br /><br />Watch Movement:<br /><br />This model has an automatic movement in it as opposed to a battery operated quartz movement.  The automatic movement, known in Rolex circles as \\"perpetual\\" has a pendulum and clutch that moves when you move your arm.  This is unnoticed by the wearer.  The wearer's motion keeps the main spring constantly wound.  This particular model uses the Seiko 7S26(A or B) caliber movement.  I suspect that if you purchase this watch now you'll get the 7S26B version.  The B version has a couple of improvements over the A version and you can read about them if you do a search on it.  The 7S26 caliber movement can be compared to the Miyota (Citizen) 8215 movement found in the Invicta line of watches like the Invicta 8926 Submariner homage.  Both movements have 21 jewels, and both are non-hacking.  But, the Myota can be manual wound and the Seiko cannot.  The Seiko will wind in both pendulum directions and the Myota only winds in one pendulum direction.  Both movements have about the same accuracy and same power reserves.  For those of you that are environmentally conscious, this is the \\"greenest\\" type of watch movement.<br /><br />Watch Bracelet:<br /><br />The bracelet is a stainless steel jubilee style bracelet.  The name \\"jubilee\\" comes from Rolex and is an iconic bracelet found on the Rolex Datejust and Day/Date models.  The Seiko bracelet is actually a very good quality bracelet given the price point of this watch.  The center links are folded, but the ends are solid.  This makes a very solid yet light bracelet that is very comfortable and strong.  Seiko also sells a very comfortable rubber strap for this watch that is not too expensive.<br /><br />Watch Size:<br /><br />The watch is right around 40mm without the crown.  With the crown it's around 43mm.  The crown is at the four o'clock position which makes is very comfortable.  The watch is around 13mm thick.  The width and height are important numbers to determine if a watch will feel balanced on the wrist.  The Seiko numbers are very good for providing a well balanced feel on the wrist.  The lug width is 22mm which is a common width for dive watches.  This means that you can find a lot of aftermarket straps and bracelets that will fit this watch if you want to experiment.<br /><br />Watch Case:<br /><br />The case is a combination polished and brushed stainless steel.  This combination is a time tested classic look.  The shape of the case has smooth lines with no pointy or pokey areas on the watch.  The case reminds me of the way the Japanese create a sense of ergonomics like no one else can.  The uni-directional bezel is a double coin edge type that is both functional and great looking.  It has a glow in the dark flat oyster at the twelve o'clock position.  The crown is at the four o'clock position and screws down.  There is a rubber gasket in the crown so that when it is screwed down it will make the watch \\"water proof.\\"  The case also has a crown protector which creates a barrier from damage.  This is imperative on a beater tool watch.<br /><br />Watch Face:<br /><br />The face is a strikingly nice dark blue color.  The hour markers are large dots with differentiators at the six, nine, and twelve o'clock positions.  These markers are coated with a luminescent material (Lumibrite) that glows in the dark.  When looking at the watch in pitch black conditions, it is totally readable.  The hands are iconic of this watch.  The most striking is the minute hand.  It is large and draws the eye to it.  This is important when diving because you are most concerned with the number of minutes you've spent down.  The seconds hand is identifiable because of the lollipop at one end so it is unmistakable in low light conditions.  All the hands are glow in dark.  It has a day/date display that can display either English or Spanish, and is highly readable.  The crystal is made out of a Seiko proprietary material known as \\"Hardlex.\\"  Most watches have crystals that are made out of either mineral or sapphire.  Mineral crystals have the benefit of being flexible so they can take a knock without breaking, but they scratch easy.  Sapphire crystals are virtually impossible to scratch without a diamond, yet they are not flexible so they can shatter.  Hardlex is somewhere in between and performs very well in this regard.<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />Perhaps this watch can be considered as one of the all time greatest watches at any price?minescent material (Lumibrite) that glows in the dark.

B003HARV3Y|4.0|I thought this was a very interesting and exciting movie.  Being that I've had a slight obsession with Mythology has a teen, I thought this movie was awesome.  However, I can't judge this movie based on the books because I have yet to read them.  When I saw this movie it came on cable TV and I decided to watch it simply because I was eager to see it since the previews.  Speaking as a huge movie buff I would give this movie 4 thumbs up because of the action and story that was told.  In truth, it probably wasn't anything like the readers were expecting but if this movie was originated as just a movie and not a book first; I'm sure it would've been a hit to everyone. As far as the \\"somewhat sexually oriented scenes\\"; this is America and sex sells, whether it's appreciated or not.  All in all I liked this movie and I look forward to watching it again and again until I grow tired of it.  Also, for those who wish to compare this movie to Harry Potter because of its influences; you all are lunatics.  Harry Potter is a scenic empire with many movies in its collection. If the comparison is simply because they each began as books and then as movies, then whatever.  But to judge this movie simply because it did not compare to Harry Potter is just retarded.  I LIKED IT!!!! I thought it rocked.....yay MYTHOLOGY!!!!
1594202842|1.0|I've never read Chua's other books and didn't even know she was actually an author besides being a professor, but I think she was incredibly naive to publish this. It lacks substance, seems hastily put together, and even becomes super boring somewhere in the middle. Chua's story is basically an extended rant diary of two daughters, forced attempts to play instruments, and family fights. Of course, we have the extended family in the background. Surprisingly, they actually seem to approve of Chua's harsh parenting style.<br /><br />I purchased this book almost a year ago because my dad had read about it through a Chinese newspaper and was interested (he still hasn't read the book himself, which says something). I had also heard of it through professional online reviews and was, I admit, a bit curious.<br /><br />The book is split up into three parts. Chua hit the jackpot by marrying Jed, another author who seems to be able to take a lot of crap. They produce two daughters, Sophia and Louisa \\"Lulu\\", who are forced to endure countless musical lessons and prepare themselves the hard way for academia. Throughout all of this, Chua seems like she really doesn't care about emotionally abusing them, their lack of social lives, or even their moods.<br /><br />Chua's approach to parenting is very unhealthy and unusual. She insists that this is the Chinese way, yet her parents never seemed to raise her as strictly. If they did, she rebelled. As another reviewer mentioned, she hypocritically married Jed. He was not the educated Chinese man her parents wanted for their daughter, but today they've managed to get along with him quite well. Why doesn't she compromise with a similar attitude for her daughters? Chua's father insisted she go to Berkeley, but she ended up going to Harvard.<br /><br />There is one incident in this book where she recalls that in their native Chinese, her father had referred to her as a piece of trash. She does the same thing to one of her daughters but instead just says it flatly in English. When someone calls her out on it, she explains that it's \\"a Chinese immigrant thing\\". Yet, \\"You're not a Chinese immigrant.\\" Exactly, that should sum up the rest of the book. We're hearing all of this about how to parent from someone who was actually born and raised in America? Granted, she's of Chinese descent, but don't act like you just came off of the plane. Chua does. She was even raised in predominantly white areas.<br /><br />Chua bullies her kids but she doesn't seem to actually realize that this parenting style is highly outdated. Then again, how should she know any better? A long time ago, her grandparents were the last generation to be born and raised in China. I've heard that people in China today are Westernizing, and no one actually acts like this anymore. People have become more open about things.<br /><br />A waste of time. I finished the book thinking that had Lulu not rebelled at the meal in Russia, she would of still continued to endure so much hardship under her excessively strict mother. The book is boring, predictable, and hard to read. If you have to, just check it out from the library or borrow it from a friend.en someone calls her out on it, she explains that it's \\"a Chinese immigrant thing\\".

1601253788|5.0|If there is the one type of RPG book that nobody ever has enough of, it's monster books ! Bestiary 3 for Pathfinder is here. Does it follow the tradition of great quality found in the previous two monster books? Is Paizo running out of steam in monster development? Is this the Wuxia Anime book of no use for a conservative SCA aficionado? Are demodands in? Skunks? Flumphs? Do Tanookis have giant scrotums? Find out!<br /><br />===PRESENTATION===<br /><br />A solid sewn hardcover book with over 320 pages in full color. While extremely pretty and of the usual Paizo art quality, I am somewhat torn as to a few pieces of artwork. Then again, it has more Eric Belisle and Carolina Eade than any other Paizo book, so I guess it's fine. There are several navigational aids, including indexes and CR tables. The book is a pleasure to look at and use.<br /><br />===CONTENT===<br /><br />OK, so we've had the mandatory Bestiary 1 which was a no-brainer. Then came Bestiary 2 which mixed \\"must have\\" monsters left after B1 with both new arrivals and plugging of several conceptual holes (Plants and Fey come to mind). So what's in for Bestiary 3?<br /><br />First thing off - is this the Asian monster book? No, I'd say. There are several monsters that hail from Far East, but by no way do they overwhelm the book.<br /><br />But, once could say, it's the Mythology & Nostalgia Monster Book. Mythological beasts from all walks of known folklore appear on the pages of B3. Germanic, Slavic, North American, South American, Philippine, Arabian, Persian, Chinese, African, Inuit... Legends of all these areas contribute their monsters and strange denizens.<br /><br />Nostalgia means the triumphant return of Misfit Monsters: Flumph, Tojanida, Wolf-in-Sheep Clothing, all of them fresh after treatment they got in Misfit Monsters Redeemed. On a slightly less goofy note, classics such as Pseudodragon, Caryatid Column and Axebeak are back here as well. Demodands drop in to a long awaited \\"hi\\" and round out the classic evil outsider troupe.<br />And there's the Demilich, and boy does it live up to it's legendary TPK generator status.<br /><br />More and more monsters from Paizo Adventure Paths appear for their update to the current ruleset. In particular, monsters from Legacy of Fire and Serpent's Skull APs appear in strong numbers.<br /><br />Finally, more filling of niches yet unexplored. Catfolk and Suli (geniekin) races that are PC-ready. Clockwork constructs (robots, yay!), even more plants and fey to make up for their short numbers, funky new oozes (oozi?) such as Plasma Ooze.<br /><br />Of course, there are \\"normal\\" animals and insects, and more dinosaurs than you can handle - James Jacobs, I see what you did there.<br /><br />Taking up where Bestiary 2 left, there are quite a lot of high CR monsters, going up to CR 24.<br /><br />The monsters are consistently presented in 1 page = 1 monster format, making the book far easier to use than the 3.5 MM. The universal monster rules system is here as well, with all the common special rules placed in one chapter.<br /><br />===CONCLUSION===<br /><br />So, to answer the questions stated above - yes, it follows the quality standard of B1 and B2, no, Paizo doesn't seems to be running out of ideas (this book contains very few \\"funky monsters made up from the scratch so that we can copyright them and never worry about somebody using them in their RPG which will overtake our products in sales someday\\"), no, it's not a Wuxia Bestiary (but it's does feel rather exotic if your entire knowledge of human mythology is limited to Western Europe), demodands, flumphs and skunks (both vanilla and giant variety) are in and OMG Tanookis don't have giant scrotums!<br /><br />Love the book, please make more :)oes it live up to it's legendary TPK generator status.

B0053F042G|5.0|Great ensemble cast - down to the extras.  The development of Jake Gyllenhaal's character is remarkable and whoever is responsible for the little details about his character should be commended.  For example, the character's fingernails becoming dirty as the story goes - who would have thought of that?  [The only character that was played stereotypically in my opinion, was the boss.  I don't know of any brilliant computer geek who is that ruthless.]   AND the way they portrayed Chicago is absolutely beautiful.  Many movies/tv shows set in a generic large city (usually Chicago but sometimes they don't say it, will have stock footage of the buildings and skyline - but sometimes they are outdated).  In this particular movie, they had the outdoor shots set in the present Chicago - with new landmarks like the Bean (Cloud Gate) and Trump Tower among others, well-featured.  The aerial shots of the city, showcasing its architecture and the general cleanliness of the city ... are gorgeous and quite frankly, fresh looking.  And since they shot this in the spring - the city can't be more photogenic (although it is always, any season).
B002AT4KA0|5.0|I of course have already seen this movie thousands of times. However, I wanted all of the DVDs as a collection so I bought this together instead of having them as a separate intity.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I actually just randomly chose to watch this on Netflix the other evening and watched all four parts in one sitting. It was spectacular. The cinematography was beautiful, the soundtrack amazing, and the story...ten times as good.   I thought it might be a girly 1800's romance but there was so much depth to the story, so much more going on then just two people falling for each other. There was gloom, and hardship, and oppression and heartbreak and struggle and everything you could imagine in an industrial town. And then mixed in were politics, and social rules, and then love.   I simply can not praise this piece enough. When it was over I felt like I had sat in the Sistine Chapel for four hours, it really is art on every level. Film art, music art, story art. It really has everything.  I've been listening to the soundtrack for 2 days now and started the book last night which is so far just as good.  Do yourself a favor and watch this...go ahead and buy it since I know you'll love it. :)
B005OK721G|5.0|Zoe Saldana is taking over action movies, or so she should after \\"Colombiana\\"! The movie was way better than I initially expected after reading a few reviews on Amazon. \\"Colombiana\\" was pure genius. Catelaya was an incredible character, and Zoe Saladana did an amazing job acting wise, and action wise. I don't think there was one part of the movie that was slow, maybe the introduction that took maybe 4 minutes tops before the action kicks in. Zoe should definitely keep up with the action roles.

0439813786|5.0|When Martin Scorsese set out to make a film adaptation of The Invention of Hugo Cabret, much of his work was already done for him. Brian Selznick's illustrations in the novel can serve as very detailed storyboards for anyone wanting to film this story, rooted in cinema, magic, lost archives and exploration of the imagination. Not only does the novel hold much attraction for anyone, such as Scorsese, who is a student of early film, but the story is full of the imagery of early 1930's Paris so Francophiles will be pleased as well as those bibliographic archaeologists who love to dig through old tomes to find keys to forgotten chapters from the past.  Hugo Cabret is an orphan and a thief and a railroad station urchin. He can't really be referred to as a street urchin because he rarely ventures outside the confines of the Paris Railway Station. Doing so runs the ever present risk of being caught by the Station Inspector and jailed until he is sent to an orphanage. He has inherited his father's skills as a watchmaker, tinker and fixer of most things mechanical. He has also inherited the job his drunken derelict of an uncle left him when he fell into the Seine in a drunken stupor and drowned i.e. keeping the clocks running in the train station. Hugo seeks solace sneaking into cinema houses recalling another young movie-loving urchin Antoine Doinel (Selznick cites Truffaut's The 400 Blows as one of his influences).  The forgotten film pioneer and magician Georges Melies, living in obscurity operating a toy shop that resides in the train station, is a kindred spirit to Hugo, and the story that weaves their lives together is a fascinating account where both of these characters are forced to employ their inventive imaginations by desperate necessity for survival.   The illustrations are just important as the words in this novel. The prose will stop for a series of six pages illustrating an incident and the prose will resume logically after the story the pictures told. Yes, itis a juvenile book and the prose style is not above the reading level of a ten-year old. However, the novel does not condescend to the children in this story. They lie and steal. They're vengeful. There is not a streak of sentimentality in any of them, nor does any cuteness seep in as it does even in a great work such as the Harry Potter series. Yet they are also loyal and ultimately do the right thing. The characters are believable and their actions stem naturally from what we see of their temperaments. The weaving of the plot strands is masterful. No less masterful is the juxtaposition of the illustrations and the prose. Like the works created, sought after and loved by many of its characters, it is a fine piece of machinery.

B001DJLCRC|5.0|I took the supreme gamble when I first got this DVD set.  I bought it, sight unseen, from the recommendations of a few sources.  Pretty much every reviewer I read raved about the series, but never gave any indication as to what is was about or why it was good.  While you may know now that the story is about a brilliant chemist who is diagnosed with inoperable cancer who makes a horrible decision to cook crystal meth in a one-time deal to leave a nest-egg for his family.  But that does not encapsulate why this is such a great show.  The show is so great because it is the consequences of one incredibly bad decision.  The lies and bad actions multiply as he lies to the cops and his family and he morphs into a criminal figure; something he had no intended but can't escape.  Blah, blah, blah.  That is the basic story, but what is so great about this story is how it changes tone throughout the story.  What starts off as a basic drama then becomes a comedy of the blackest sort.  But around the 6th or 7th show, it drastically takes a turn into danger.  The people who work with him become increasingly psychotic, unpredictable and dangerous.  The show then says to us, \\"We're not messing around here anymore.  These are dangerous people and dangerous situations.\\"  Check out this series, it is one of the best on TV that is not on HBO.  You will not be disappointed.

1419702203|2.0|This book is severely lacking in the area of Patti Boyd, who was/is George's true soul mate.  He said it all in song, he wanted her back \\"to have and hold til we are old and grey.\\"  Isn't it a Pity that he treated her like a piece of meat when she told him about Clapton's obsessive pursuit.  She always loved George and never wanted to leave.  This is the FACT I have done a TON of research on this because I love them all.  She was the one who got him into Vedic, Indian culture, she also found Friar Park, his home he loved so dearly and worked on for years.  I can understand that Ms. Olivia must feel very insecure about this, as she can't even listen to \\"Layla.\\" But went LA<LA<LA<LA< and couldn't even speak of it.  Layla was not even written by George!!!!  So I suppose all of these vital facts were omitted out of respect for her feelings.  She has nothing to fear.  I'm sure George loved her in a different way.  BUT the best thing about this is that we still have Dhani, George's son, as Patti was never able to have children. So, it was just meant to be.  Still you can't CUT Patti out of his entire life.  This only gives maybe half a picture.  Something, the greatest love song in the world was written about Patti.  This is another serious omission for not allowing or admitting that she was the muse for his highly acclaimed and best selling song he ever wrote.  And it is true about what someone here has said about the Kinfaus house, a picture of George taken in front of it, NOT EVEN CREDITED to Patti!  This is not only a flaw, but against the law.  I'm sure Patti is not a law-suit oriented person and will do nothing  For a more honest rendition of George's life, please refer to the above-mentioned \\"I, Me, Mine.\\"  BY GEORGE HARRISON (hard to find, but you can probably get a pretty good deal at AlLibris) and simple old Wickipedia.

To anyone who saw them at this time, I say you were sooo lucky.) Anyway, I liked the \\"original\\" take as well. Though it seems very similar to the finished product, it was interesting to hear some minor differences, especially with the recorded dialogue snippets that appear at the end of the \\"official\\" version of \\"Money\\" that are not present in this version. That being said, it is a testament to the band's creativity and professionalism, that the songs are pretty much polished even at this stage. I also enjoyed the extra cuts like \\"The Hard Way\\" which is amazing that the funky bass sound is made by a rubber band (according to an account I read about in a bio of the band). And the legendary beat that is already present in the demo version of \\"Money\\". I do have on caveat, though. One of the reasons for purchasing this set was that I thought there would be more live visuals of the band performing this legendary album. Unfortunately, there are just two performances (of non-DSOFTM material). And the \\"concert screen films\\" are just a combination of live and animated film sequences that would have been shown on a background screen accompanying the performances. I was a bit disappointed, then I recalled reading that there really is no visual recording of their live performances of this album. Wishful thinking on my part. Oh well. Anyway,this is still a great set to own. (One question -- what are the marbles for?)
1451648537|5.0|Let me start by saying I am NOT in the Cult of Steve Jobs.  I love Apple products, but I don't necessarily revere the man that is Steve Jobs.  That said, you cannot ignore the impact Steve Jobs has had on our lives since the 70s.  The book is very interesting in that Isaccson had direct access to his primary subject, and I think he was seduced by Jobs.  However, he does not scimp on the negative aspects of his life.  By all accounts from enemies, friends and even Jobs himself, he was a bastard to a lot of people.  A vsionary, but deeply flawed individual, in short, a man.  Acolytes of Apple seem to want to gloss over this aspect of his life, but it cannot be ignored.  I am struck by how such a cruel man could, at the same time, be capable of great empathy to the world, but have so little for those closest to him.  It is odd how a man who had so little fashion and attention to his own appearance could have so much taste in his products.  The book is effusive both in the good and bad sides of Jobs, but I believe it is also a little too apologetic for his bad side.  He continues to make excuses for Jobs cruel behavior, basically saying the ends justify the means.  He also keeps bashing Microsoft in general and Bill Gates in particular; basically saying they peddle a substandard product and copying everything else Apple does.  I think it is a little unfair on both counts, but it is an interesting story, and one that is worth telling.  This man was the inspiration and hawkster of some of the most influential products of our times.  He has also changed several industries, in most cases, for the better.  This is an interesting study of a man of opposites, but of drive.  Highly recommended.
1439181780|5.0|I really liked this book. I thought it would be the same as The Secret, but it wasn't. There was more interesting information about the effects of having positive thoughts, how to properly use positive thoughts, and more inspirational stories. If you loved, or even just liked The Secret, I would suggest buying and reading this book.
B005KELR3A|2.0|I got my Belkin Grip Sleeve for Kindle and Kindle Touch, Blacktop but I was dissapointed because I couldn't use it with mi Kindle Touch Lighted Cover.  The Product Dimensions for your Sleeve at Amazon state: 8 x 5.6 x 0.7 inches.  The lighted cover is: 7.3 x 5 x 0.6 inches. It should have fitted in nicely.  Unfortunately, I took a measuring tape and the sleeve is roughly 7.32 x 5.07 x 0.7 inches.<br />I've had a hard time making it fit and close safely.  Is it that I got one faulty sleeve or is it misadvertising??  The sleeve itself is nice to touch and feel at your hand and should protect the Kindle against minor bumps and scratches.

B005EY2XFC|4.0|When I first saw the Crow in the early 90s, it struck a responsive chord with me, being in my angry 20s.  The Crow resonates with a melancholy feel, probably because of the death of its star, Brandon Lee.  But what struck me more than anything was the cinematography of the whole film.  Even though it's in color, it's shot like it was in black and white.  There are hardly any colors at all and those that are there, are washed out in the gritty urban hell that the story takes place in.  The story by itself is not all that spectacular.  In fact, it is not much more than a B movie revenge drama, but the look is what makes it so great.  The other element that makes the Crow so good is the soundtrack.  The Onion accurately called the soundtrack a great soundtrack to an otherwise mediocre film.  The soundtrack is a wonderful slice of the feeling of the time.  It is a tiny time capsule of the early 90s when the members of Gen X were justifiably angry at the Baby Boomers and Me Generation for creating a great party but sticking us with the bill, all the while blithely droning on about how great they were and their accomplishments were and what shiftless layabouts we were by comparison.  The Crow's feel and music perfectly reflect that angst and anger and make an otherwise okay movie into a much better than average flick.
B000HEVALC|5.0|The CD 'The Complete Million Dollar Quartet' is a must have for Elvis fans. Only one or two complete songs. Strictly a jam session, history in the making. Mostly heard are Elvis and Jerry Lee.  I had never even been to the Amazon website before buying this CD. I was very pleased with the service, professional and timely. No problems.
B0042816YK|5.0|We had read the book previously and enjoyed it.  The movie was almost as good as the book.  Our daughter was visiting and it was a great family activity for the holidays.  It is highly recommended.
B0067TQQI8|5.0|I read a previous review from someone who had rated this item 5 stars and recommended it for use with the Samsung Galaxy Nexus.  I just purchased the same phone and after reading the review, decided to order the product myself.  Came 4 days sooner than the estimated shipping date.  Really happy with the service.  Product seems very well made.  Charging it as I write this review.

1401219268|5.0|There has been a lot of ballyhoo about how great Watchmen is, and I am only going to reiterate some of it.  But, much like the Grand Canyon, in this case, they hype is true.  Along with Frank Miller's Dark Knight Returns, this was the seminal story that took graphical stories straight out of the kid's domain and directly into the adult realm.  Watchmen can rightfully take its place as great literature.  Alan Moore, while a certifiable whack job, takes his place among great, but eccentric authors.  The story of Watchmen takes the superhero and throws it into the real world with real problems and real psychological issues.  The story in itself is incredibly depressing and reflects Moore's fairly pessimistic view of human nature.  But the richly drawn characters make the unbelievable world of superheroes totally believable.  Give yourself a treat and check this out.
B005GVF95O|1.0|Crying out loud, yet another up for free that is not for adults. There goes my day of a free app. You soccer mommies and stay at home daddies I hope you enjoy your free app for your kiddies. the rest of us have the suffering wait until tomorrow. useless.

B0064J6OMO|5.0|So many laugh out loud moments!! Didn't really know what to expect but it was SO funny! Many f-bombs and kinda raunchy at times but if you're ok with that then totally worth it! I watched it twice in two days and am buying it to watch whenever I need a good belly laugh! :)  Thought it may be a bit cheesy b/c of the whole switching bodies but they did it so well! Great actors in every role, great casting!! :)
B004T32SOK|1.0|I don't know if BOX even works on Kindle Fire. I downloaded from Amazon app store &amp; installed it, but have NEVER BEEN ABLE TO LOG IN! It's been a few weeks now, I emailed support but no response!! Whenever I try to log in with my email/password it says unable to log me in &amp; if problem continues (which it has) to contact support for  BOX for Android (which I've done)! I also try alternative log in (Google box) but it says  &quot;SSO login not enabled.&quot;  BOX for Iphone works perfect for me, and the website thru kindle fire works too. ONLY THIS APP HERE THAT DOES NOT WORK! You don't have Dropbox, so at least make this work please!!! Then I can Re-Rate it, hopefully more than 1 * star * !!!
B005KELQEU|1.0|I ordered this case with the newest Kindle touch after reading reviews of this and other cases.  I was particularly persuaded by  the response given by Belkin's customer service to a review indicating that the case is too small; Belkin's customer service claims that the case is designed for the latest generation thereby implying that it should fit.  Simply put, the device does not fit in the case/sleeve: zippers are difficult to close, zippers scrape the sides of the device, there is nothing to shield the power button from the case so it is turned back on by the case being zipped closed.  The item is being returned.
B000002IWH|5.0|The Onion correctly called the soundtrack to The Crow a great soundtrack to an otherwise dull movie.  This is the perfect description of this film and soundtrack.  It perfectly encapsulates the feeling of anger and angst felt by Gen X in the early 1990s.  The Baby Boomers and Me Generation blew so much smoke up our behinds about their greatness and accomplishments.  By comparison, we were angry, tattooed and pierced idiotic layabouts to them.  But no wonder.  They had drugs without crack, sex without AIDS and left us with the bill.  No wonder we were so angry.  But in all seriousness, all the songs reflected an anger and immediacy that reflected how many of us felt.  Today, as I'm older, I suppose I've mellowed, but when I listen to the songs of this soundtrack, I am transported back to an age when life was before me and a littler dangerous, but very exciting.  It is not for all tastes, especially with it so down, but this is the way it was then, how I was then, and isn't that what great songs are supposed to do?  Aren't they meant to evoke strong feelings?  Check it out.  From The Cure, to Nine Inch Nails, to Helmet and Machines of Loving Grace, there is not a stinker in this bunch.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Shows an ad at the beginning each game, but cares? Other than that it's number one. word word word word word

B0054JZC6E|3.0|ok, some games have weird controls though.  maybe good if you are looking to waste some time. very simple mini game collection . cant complain when it is free
B0038ZITIE|4.0|This movie is a true anomaly.  Everything in this movie is perfect, except for the two leads.  It evokes the cheesy nostalgia of the Flash Gordon serials from the 30s and 40s.  The costume design and set design are perfect for the subject matter.  The supporting cast is incredible, with such notables like future Bond Timothy Dalton, Robin Hood's father Brian Blessed, and the best Ming the Merciless in Max Von Sydow.  The special effects are a little outdated and cheesy, but it is indicative of its early 80s pedigree and also evokes the old serials.  The music, provided by Queen, is fantastic and again evokes the 80s beautifully.  The almost fatal falw are the two leads for Flash and his lady, Dale Arden.  They cannot act their way out of a paper bag.  They are perfectly cast, they look perfect, but cannot act to save their lives.  Of course, with lines like \\"Flash, I love you!  But we only have 14 hours to save the Earth!\\" it is hard to be believable.  One wonders how the actors were able to say such lines with a straight face.  But when the menace of Ming and Klytus, the sexy danger of Princess Aurra, Topol's no-nonsense portrayal of Hans Zarkov, the boisterousness of Prince Vultan and the sexy smoothness of Prince Barrin, this movie hits all the right notes.  A perfect mix of cheesy nostalgia and fun action.  Go see it!
B004VMVTNU|5.0|Couldn't live without this app. It is well designed, and has worked flawlessly since I purchased it several months ago. The options available are the best of any alarm i've tried.
1400069181|5.0|Purchased as a gift for my husband, he has already started reading and seems to be enjoying the book a lot.
B00532A8JI|5.0|I wish there was a way to give this album 12 out of 5 starts.  It is amazing from start to finish.  There is not one second of this album that is not amazing.  Michael Romeo blows me away. His riffs are so melodic, so heavy, and so amazing that it kills me.  And his solos are out of this world.  He is a god. And Russell Allen's vocals are nothing short of powerful.  Jason Rullo's drumming is technical and phenomenal.  He provides the perfect compliment to Romeo's insane guitar work.  This album is far and away (in my opinion) the best metal album relased within the last several years.  I'm having a hard time thinking of a better album that has come out in the last 5 or 6 years.
B0062A5RUA|2.0|I have each of these songs, the normal versions. and I have listened to them and enjoyed them. So I thought this will be awesome! I figured that Slash would mix it up a little do a nice twist on some of my old and new favorites. I was wrong. This album is the same thing just worse singing (in most cases)No twist no difference just worse. And I would not recommend this album to someone who is new to Slash and his awesome music, due to the fact I would be afraid they would say \\"This isn't that great\\" which I think should be the title of the album. See Chris Cornell just released an album \\"Songbook\\" with several songs from his previous bands. and he did them in acoustic, so there was a twist somewhat. ( It was a better album not 5 stars but good still) But I was hoping for a twist like You're crazy from Appetite for Destruction, Then the GN'R Lies version. THAT is what i was hoping for. Even for the 4 bucks not worth it.
B0063IH60K|5.0|great app with no problems.  I haven't been able to stop playing since I got it. definatly would.recommend to all.knlindle fire users
B003IKMR0U|5.0|Played this while at a gamer tavern waiting for food.  We got so caught up in it that we didn't even flinch when the food was perched in front of us while we played.  After that lunch, we went right to our local game store to buy this and Cthuhlu dice as well.    Rules are simple and anyone can play.  ANYONE.    Everyone has pretty much summed up the game in earlier reviews but let me put a little further insight.    If I could keep this game on me at all times I would.  Since I don't have an Iphone I can't really download the travel app but I'm sure it will eventually come to Android.    I would seriously love to break this game out when I have some time to kill.    It doesn't get boring as quickly as one might think.  It's because it appeals to gambler in us all and allows us to wager and risk without losing anything overly significant.  Maybe some pride if you are playing with friends.  Just think of it like a no stakes game of dice.    I love the fact that you need to know when to bank your brains instead of continuing.  But sometimes, someone will pull ahead and you have to get those last dice to show up or else risk losing the game.  Yes, you can play this single player and I'm content with that too.  (Keep banking until you reach a certain amount of brains.  3 shotguns on any given turn (not roll) is game over, pick a new number.)  This game is somewhat comparable to Cthuhlu dice.  However, it's best described as it's only as similar as it is different.  Zombie Dice is entirely self contained and doesn't need anything else but the dice.    Anyone can play this game and everyone should.  As long as the people involved are actually playing the game and not actually throwing the dice to make funny sounds for their amusement, everyone stands an equal chance of winning at any time.    Excellent game.  Good time waster.  Ultra fun to play with friends.  Easy enough for a child to pick up.    BTW, if a player rolls all the brains in one turn I suggest you congratulate them.  Odds are 1 in 1,119,744 that would happen.  Or for the pessimistic mathematician %.0000009 chance.   Looking forward to the expansion coming soon!
B00499K9E0|2.0|They show those episodes on the Russian TV now. The've begun with the \\"Scandal in Belgravia\\" which was very good indeed. But then they continued with the \\"Study in Pink\\" and those other episodes. This was very disappointing. I know those Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's novels very well, and the thing which I like in them is this Sherlock's ability to make the analysis and his deduction. However, here the authors of the films added a lot of other events, which are called \\"subplots\\" in America, and the main plot has lost not only the whole its charm, but the whole its sense, even the Dr. Watson's common sense. And, as the whole charm of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's stories is in Sherlock's deduction, all this charm is lost. Nothing is properly explained. Adding the subplots the authors wanted to add this modern adrenaline rush to their film, but this spoiled everything. To place Sherlock in our modern world was a good idea, but the adrenaline rush and constant inexplicable and aimless tension spoiled everything. After having watched those series I really think that Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock lived in far better and far less cruel world than we do. If you like Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's stories, you'll be very disappointed.  Rev. Katarina Tkachova
B005W3G2D4|5.0|Gave it a try because she endorsed Ron Paul.  Listened to the sample of the album and bought it.  Very nice.  Thanks Kelly for acknowledging that this country is going in the wrong direction and only Ron Paul can change that.  Only he represents true change.  Thanks for that and thanks for releasing a very nice and enjoyable album.
014050639X|5.0|I love anything by the authors, but this was one of my favorites when I was a little girl...I now often buy this book as a gift for little ones. Great little \\"I Spy\\" game for children.
B005N95JA4|5.0|I prefer this to what was originally released in 1978.  There are 5 or 6 songs I would have substitued.  Among them are Claudine, Do You Think I Really Care, We Had it All,  and I Love You too Much.  Hearing Keith on We Had it All made me think how much better Far Away Eyes would have been if he had sung it.  The man has a truly brilliant country voice, full of heartache and tenderness.  Mick, not so much.  But as always, Mick is great on the rockers!
B000002WCJ|5.0|I've been listening to this album for over twenty years.  If you are a metal head this one is for you.  Soaring vocals, mind blowing guitars and hit you up both sides of the head bass and drums.  I put this in the same league as Paranoid, British Steel, Number of the Beast and Master of Puppets.  It's just that good.
B005ZUR724|4.0|This is an amazing MMO for mobile devices, and by far the closest thing you will get to a PC experiance. The gameplay is fun and the world is diverse with 4 classes 4 races and tons to explore.  This game now runs quite well on the kindle fire, and for 99&cent; its a steal. It is subscription based but the the cost is low and you get 3 months free, if your still playing after 3 months you probably will not mind the small price. My only complaint is in app purchases I feel that if a MMO is pay to play then there should not be additional fees, while they are optional they do give an edge to those willing to pay. All and all its a great game and I would get it while it is on sale.   5 stars if in app purchases purely aesthetic or non existant.
B002361MLA|5.0|I am sorry I didn't read this book earlier. It might have been a good chance for me to change things in my life years ago. But, as the author says,if I got it right, only Now matters and Now is the perfect time, so it is not late. I am far from being enlightened, but for sure I feel that reading this book gave me the chance to be part of something special. The essential feature of the author's style, in my opinion, is the talent to put big truth in simple words. How else could somebody speak of Being? I want to read it again and again and who knows... I recommend it to everybody who haven't read it yet.

B005K0HDGE|3.0|I wasn't going to buy this book for two reasons: First was the price of the Kindle e-version. $9.99 is my limit for an eletronic pulse, no matter who writes the book or how long it is. Second, I honestly didn't like the premise. The paperback version had my name written all over it. But, I ended up getting the hardcover for Christmas, so read it I did. I've been a fan of Mr. King forever (that would be 1984), but I'll admit that I haven't liked every book he's written (how good was Night Shift???). There's no doubt he has evolved into one of the best storytellers ever. Period. Any genre, novel, novella, or short story. His character's dialogue is simply fantastic, and when characters in books sound like real people, it makes reading so much better. This book was - of course - very well written. I liked the characters: they were real and I could buy into them. The story itself was good for, in my opinion, the first two-thirds or three-fourths of the book. The last bits took a direction I didn't care for very much (mainly because I would've done it differently than Jake/George did). But then again it's a time travel book, and as an amateur historian I may be jaded, and I usually dislike and avoid \\"what if\\" stories. All in all though it was a good read and I finished it in just over one week. The three-star rating I gave this book is in comparison to Mr. King's other books, not in comparison to most other writers. That, after all, wouldn't be fair to most of them!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is fab. I love it! cant wait for more levels. I have been playing it.for long periods of.time and.its fab
B005UT29Z0|5.0|this is not an action film.  those who do not have at least a basic understanding of the U.S. capital markets will more than likely be bored and confused by it.  in other words, the average Obama voter should probably pass this one up and move on to the latest edition of \\"Twilight\\" or \\"Hangover II\\".  what this film is, though, is a very interesting analysis of the events that took place at one (fictional) Wall Street brokerage firm in the hours leading up to the market's awakening to the fact that the loose lending practices that led to an over-inflated housing market, and eventually to the meltdown of the U.S. and world financial markets.  it focuses on one 24 hour period at one firm, and in the process gives a good thumbnail summary of how the market collapse began.  it is also a fascinating study in human behavior and what drove people to foist what they knew to be worthless paper that spread through our economy like a cancer on unsuspecting buyers throughout the markets. I thought it was a great film, at least as far as it goes in telling the story.  but although I liked the movie and give it 5 stars, it focuses only on one small part of the story - the part that happened AFTER all the damage had already been done.  what's missing is what led the lending institutions to make the bad mortgage loans to begin with. does anyone seriously believe that \\"greed\\" led mortgage lenders, who had been successfully making and collecting on mortgage loans for 100 years, suddenly begin to loan money to people who never had any intention of paying it back? please. be serious. what's missing is the role that corrupt politicians, mostly Democrats, played in creating the legislation that allowed them to essentially force the mortgage industry into making what they knew at the time were bad loans. what's also missing is how those corrupt politicians (e.g., Barney Frank, Chris Dodd, Maxine Waters, etc.) continued to exert pressure on lenders and insist there were no problems at Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, even AFTER they knew there was a huge problem. in addition to the federal government's role, farm teams of the Democrat Party, such as ACORN, were instrumental in using racial blackmail to influence loose mortgage lending policies. neither is there any mention of the role of Obama, who contributed to this mess both in his pre-Senate days as a shady lawyer for ACORN, and then after he was elected to the Senate as a co-conspirator with the rest of his Democrat colleagues. Wall Street has dirty hands to be sure and \\"Margin Call\\" does an excellent job of explaining how they got their hands dirty, but they didn't start the mess, and they're certainly not alone. There are no good guys in this story. only criminals and cowards.  The actions and inactions of Obama and most others in the Congress qualify them as both.  I thought this film was very interesting in presenting the thought process that led the Wall Street firms and their employees to make the cowardly decisions they did (in fairness, though, how many among us would have had the courage to walk away from millions of dollars for a few hours work when the alternative was personal financial armageddon and the house of cards was going to come down anyway?), but the movie completely gives a pass to - or, more accurately, completely ignores the role played by - the people who are ultimately accountable for this disaster - the criminals sitting in the Congress and the White House in Washington, D.C., and staffing the offices of groups like ACORN around the country. they are the ones who ultimately brought hell down on our economy. and they're still doing it.

B0054JZC6E|3.0|The title proclaims a great number of games, but all the games are subpar at best, offering little variety.  It's a good game, given that it's free, but would never be worth any actual money.

My movie is defective... what do I do now???

B00127RAJY|5.0|This is a great starter DVD if you have not worked out to Jillian's other DVD's. This DVD has 3 levels to work your way up. A set of dumbbells and a good mat is all you need to get started. I like the fact that in this DVD it's just 20 minutes, but you are constantly moving for those 20 minutes. Between the cardio and strength training, the 20 minutes fly's by. For those that are \\"less advanced\\" Anita is there showing you how to do the moves to build up to the more advanced ones. This is still one of my favorite Jillian DVD's and I often do this one when I just want a quick workout. If you are looking to get started with working out at home and you've never done any of Jillian's DVD's, this is definitely the one to buy!
B005FMZWD8|4.0|Beautiful watch face...I thought it may be too big but actually it is just fine...I've already gotten a few compliments on the watch and I've only had it a week or so.  While the watch band is comfortable, unfortunately the material on the outside of the band is black fabric and has already shown signs of wear after only wearing the watch for a few days.  The inside of the watch band is leather, and comfortable on my wrist.  But I can already tell that that the band is going to  need to be replaced sooner than later as the watch band holes already are fraying...My better half says that the watch band looks so inferior to the watch itself.  I hate to say this, but...she is right.  (there, I said it!)

I was a bit leery because some described it as an Americanized Battle Royale, but the author did a good job taking this similar premise and creating a unique story.  The main character has an adolescent complexity that keeps her an interesting protagonist, which may be why this book is so enjoyable.  The dialogue is plain and direct, but that helps keep the main characters believable as teenagers.  I'd recommend this book to anyone who enjoys:  - Quick, entertaining reads  - Survival stories about grit and resourcefulness   - Anti-authoritarian fiction  - Love triangles  - Underdogs
B004FOA84A|4.0|This game is like a short compact version of The 7th Guest, Myst, or Riven.  If you enjoyed these games you will enjoy this one as well, just don't expect a ton of exploring.  The entire game takes place in a mansion and back yard totaling about 20 screens worth of rooms.  In each room there are puzzles, objects used to solve the puzzles, or clues on how to solve puzzles.  Your goal is to find these clues and items and figure out where else in the house they are relevant and how.  For the most part it is pretty easy.  For example, a 3 number combination can be found and there is only one place you can use a 3 number combination.  Graphics:  The graphics are entirely static images with areas you can click on to perform actions.  If you click a drawer that opens the image shows the drawer now opened and stays that way permanently unless it is one of a few items in the game you can use multiple times.  They are great images though and there is not many places where it looks like you could use something and you can't.  The graphics have a bit of an old style feel to them which is suitable for being in an old mansion.  Sound:  The sound adds some atmosphere to the game, and there are effects when opening a drawer or solving a puzzle.  The effects are standard and the rest of the music is well suited.  Controls: The places to touch to transition from room to room are well displayed and obvious.  All of the puzzles moved precisely when clicked.  Story: The story is not too exciting, you are looking for your grandfather.  Finding him is a bit lackluster and if I hadn't read any reviews before I bought the game I would have thought it was a transition to the next chapter rather than an abrupt ending.  I thoroughly enjoy these type of games and there are not enough of them on the market.  While this game was definitely too short for me that speaks to the fact I wanted to play it more.  The potential is there for more content and I felt even some of the current rooms were underused. I kept going back to them thinking there has to be more to find in this room.  It will keep you busy for an hour, maybe two.
B000E6UK5K|5.0|This CD was a gift to my dad who is a huge Pink Floyd fan so I haven't been able to listen to the whole CD, but from what I've heard it is a good CD. I was surprised when it arrived because it came long before tue estimated delivery date. I would totally recommend this CD to those who enjoy listening to Pink Floyd but are skeptical of a solo performance by one of their members! Those who aren't familiar with Pink Floyd (shame on you!) will like this CD as well!
0439023521|5.0|Excellent book. Kept me interested from the 1st to last page. In my opinion, it is the best of the trilogy series.
B00555X8OA|5.0|I highly recommend this book for giving me another reason to re-examine situations with people that don't make sense. It seems largely engineered for economics theory in business, but is fascinating for the pyschology aspect covering many diverse situations. It's an intellectual read that takes time to process. I reread many parts because I felt very positive \\"AHA\\" emotion as I read and I wanted to understand the concepts.  I was most intrigued with the examples of how bias was meticulously accounted for, and then completely ignored because the experts had too much confidence in their own estimations, and equally amazing, how people exceedingly become vested in maintaining a storyline while the facts are scanty to none to support the conclusion! I thought it was superb reading and I value a professional who acknowledges the human tendencies to perform automatically and chooses to \\"not know\\" the answer in order to get the answer, when  a problem persists.

B001UHOWXI|5.0|I enjoyed watching this old classic in the Blu-ray format.  I never grow tired of this movie.  It's a good one to watch at Christmas time.
B0021L8V0W|2.0|It's ok - about a 2-2.5 star.  Good for a rental only.  Be better to just try and catch it on TV sometime.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|This is without a doubt the best movie of 2011.  The screen play is an excellent adaptation from the book and the cast is superb. It is a movie that makes you laugh and cry. It also gives you insight into the lives of those living through the civil rights era in Jackson Mississippi.
0439023513|4.0|i never intended to read this product it is a gift for my great nephew for christmas, since that was a given. So, writing a review is useless, but nephew seemed thrilled since had all the<br />previous books for this series.

B005GVF95O|2.0|14 puzzles, for $1.99?<br /><br />That really seems like they're taking advantage of the lack of titles for very young children by putting out a pretty decent app with very little content and charging too much for it.  The only 'reward' is the sound of applause.  They could have included sound clips of the animals in the puzzles to make it seem less generic.<br /><br />While it is decent for teaching an extremely young child how to use a mobile device, I'm not sure if that's a good or bad thing. Young children probably shouldn't get into the habit of staring into a flat 'tappety tap' device until they're much older.<br /><br />While it's great for free, there's not much replay value for that $1.99 and teaching your two year old how to compute may not necessarily be in their best interests...<br /><br />I would have given this title 4 stars if there was more content, a little more thought put into it or the price were lower.  I won't give this extra stars or a nicer review just because it's free for one day.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|just the tool I needed for sorting my disparate late night flights.  highly recommended for creative types and list keepers.

Like \\"It's A Wonderful Life\\" Christmas Vacation is now a part of the heritage of Christmas.

B006G2ZEV6|5.0|The 'crash' has supposedly been fixed so the overall rating should be higher.<br /><br />This is a must have game.  A \\"killer app\\", so to speak.  If you want to show off your Kindle Fire, this is one of the games that you should have.  It is really a high quality title.  Better than many full sized PC games even.<br /><br />Excellent graphics, beautiful cut scenes and controls that work very well.  This is a polished title.  I'm not sure how many levels, but the game is challenging.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|lots of different games and skill levels and fun for kids and adults. my son and I love to play the games together.
B005NF2UE6|3.0|The case was cracked when it arrived in its padded envelope. I also don't like this album as much as I have liked the others I have of Nickelbacks so far. I consider myself to be a big fan of the band and also like the lead singer's voice and style a great deal. The album has great rifts but it seems to me like they focused more on them than the lyrics during the writing process for the songs on this album. The quality of them don't match up to what I have grown to expect out of the band. It won't stop me from getting the next one when it comes out they have had too much good music for me to give up on them at this point because of one disapointing album.
B0063IH60K|5.0|... and being &quot;free&quot; makes it that much better.  Great app.  Easy to use.  Nice visuals and quick response to touch.  No problems here.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|not a bad game. really helps if you read the descriptions of the games before you play otherwise its a little difficult.

057506885X|5.0|You may be familiar with the myth of Prometheus.  His story is told in different guises in many cultures;  he is the bringer of light.  In the myth we speak of in the western world, he stole fire from the gods.  As a punishment, he was chained to the side of a mountain.  Every day giant vultures would come and eat his liver out.  Every night it grew back.<br /><br />And this, they say, went on and on.<br /><br />Pratchett, takes the idea of this first hero, and plays a game of \\"What if?\\".  What if this hero had a counterpart, a Last Hero.  He'd already created one: Cohen the Barbarian.  From here, it is a simple task of trying to reimagine what happens when a hero who has done all the possible hero-ing would do for a final act.  Of course, it is to retrace the path of Prometheus and give fire back to the gods at the high mountain at the center of the hub.<br /><br />The problem is that this act will end the world as we know it.<br /><br />People will naturally hold tight to the status quo, and the citizens of the Discworld are no different.  A band of people from all over the world bands together to stop them.  The motley crew includes wizards and police and an Orangutan.  If you're familiar with the series, you know what I speak of; if not, you might still enjoy the book but miss out on some jokes.<br /><br />A genius inventor develops a dragon-powered ship to intercept the band of Heroes before they can complete their last task.  Will they be stopped in time?  Will the world survive?<br /><br />You'll have to read to find out.<br /><br />Now, it may sound corny in description, but reading it, I was enthralled.  The only real critique is that it feels a bit more contrived than some others in the Discworld universe (Let's just admit that they are all contrived).  It feels like the story was created to pull together as many of the disparate characters.<br /><br />The story though, is not the star here.  The star is the lavish illustrations that show the set-pieces and the action and create a depth to the world that isn't necessarily written into the books.  The only problem is that there is the cognitive dissonance created every time anyone translates the printed word into visual images.  I found myself saying \\"Carrot doesn't look like that!\\".  However, the big two page spreads are amazing, and more than make up for that small problem.<br /><br />One other issue:  the format of the book is such that it can be hard to read.  It is 160 glossy pages, and tall and wide.  I had to read it spread out on a surface, because it was impossible to read otherwise. I had to break out of some reading habits to finish the book, but it was well worth it.d the action and create a depth to the world that isn't necessarily written into the books.

B004EPYZZ8|5.0|Great movie for family movie night. This was purchased for my 15 year old granddaughter as a Christmas gift, what a hit...she loves it.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|I find this app pretty cool, it passes the time. Some of the games aren't as awesome though. Some of the movements are too slow, where I would like them to be a bit faster.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|really entertaining. love having all the different minigames and my kids love it too. we like to compete for high scores
B006JSXYPA|1.0|who is on crack that they think any movie is worth 42 dollars 3D or not.  This is just another scam like with cell companies and internet providers charging for data like there is some limited amount that isnt self imposed.  The technology is not so overwhelming in RD to cost 4 times that of dvd and twice that of blu ray.  Dont get me wrong love 3D and this was one of the best 3D movies I have seen but honestly 42 dollars just is taking advantage of consumers in a market that has no where else to go. If this disk was 30 bucks Id by it hesitantly but thats the problem with blu ray they charge way to much for the theatre experience.  Sad too cause this movie and captain america are ones i would have bought but i refuse to let them think this is a good going price for the gimmick.
B006JPS1OM|4.0|The game is entertaining, good graphics, and the music isn't as annoying as it is in other games. I gave it four stars because the little items in the seek and find are hard to click on. For being free it is fun and a good way to past time if your stuck waiting somewhere.
B005H0IW6W|5.0|I bought this as a gift as well as for myself and it was a hit!!!! We all love him!!!
B0060AY6FO|2.0|Like others who have posted, I wanted to like this book.  I didn't.  The author extracts text from various Jane Austen books, including \\"Emma\\", \\"Persuasion\\" and of course, \\"Pride and Prejudice\\".  The majority of the book in my opinion regurgitates Austen's characters without any real new information.      There are far better stories that are truer to Jane Austen's characters on fan websites, such as [...]  at Pemberley.com.      I really hope P.D. James donated proceeds from this book to the Jane Austen Society, as it seems the least that could be done to make up for such a disappointing book.

0553801473|3.0|After watching the Game of Thrones series in HBO this summer, I devoured the first 3 books in record time (and loved them!) I was very excited to continue to read the series, however, the fourth book took me months to read, as I truly disliked it. I just didn't give a hoot about all the \\"extra\\" characters, and didn't really find hearing their stories added much to the storyline.<br /><br />A Dance with Dragons lacked for me as well.  It was better than the 4th, though that isn't saying much.  There is something to be said about a good trilogy! You get to know the characters, the storyline has time to build, and then it (usually) is tied up nicely allowing you to go on to the next one!  In this series however, it seems Martin will continue to drag it out for as long as possible.  Little happened in this book and all these new characters kept being introduced.  Couple that with the deaths of more of the characters you have come to know and love, it got a little frustrating.  It did end with a cliff hanger, so of course I will read the next in the series, but I have to say it will likely take years for the next to come out, and then leave me hanging again.  It was like reading the Dark Tower series by Stephen King, I thought \\"he's probably going to die and then I will never know how it ends!\\"  Looking at Martin's pic in the back of the book, I worry the same may happen here!<br /><br />If you haven't started the series yet, wait until they are all out.  If you are stuck on them like me, sorry friends, let's keep our chins up and hope that the next one will go somewhere.<br /><br />Either way, happy reading!
B006MHWXMS|5.0|I know there are list apps out there that have tons of options and extras,  and I've tried more than I wish to count.  This one,  however, has won my vote BECAUSE of its simplicity.  I can organize my to do's under my choice of list title,  move things around and prioritize.  I can set up reminders and back things up to Google.  Its not a perfect app,  but for me,  its as good as it gets.  AND it doesnt cost 25 bucks a year to use like one app I tried.   My one comment toward improvement is to give a date layout option.  The European layout of day first,  then month threw me at first.  I can live with it but an American option would be nice.
B000001EKX|5.0|Kiss' second album Hotter Than Hell, released later the same year offers pretty much the same as the first. 3 minute punchy rockers with lots of hooks and memorable riffs. Got To Choose has some great verse/back up vocal work and superb melodies, along with the diabolical sounding Parasite is one of Gene's finest rockers. The title track, is Paul's stand out cut here, lots of sex in the lyrics and a nice stuttering backbeat from Peter. The bands early pre Rock And Roll All Nite show closer is here in its original studio cut, the short Let Me Go, Rock N Roll. Its not quite as raucous as the live counterpart this time around.<br /><br />Watchin' You is another one of the bands early day favorites. This song is a Kiss classic with a great riff. One of the good underrated rockers here is All The Way. Ripe with some cowbell, and an infectious chorus its another Simmons/Stanley rock fest. Lots of fun, and youthful rock n roll energy all around here. Another fun sort of laid back rocker is the Peter Criss sung Mainline. Nothing special but another memorable chorus and riff. Comin' Home another great Paul song which wouldnt ever be done live until it got a 2nd life when they did it on the 1995 Unplugged session. Its a rumbling track here in original form though. The ultimate highlights arrive in Goin' Blind. An interesting tale of love doomed that depicts a 93 and a 16 year old. As well as the closing track Strange Ways. Written by Ace, it was sung by Peter and features some truly cooking lead guitar work, some of Frehley's best. No doubt this was a great album if you enjoy simple yet highly melodic rock n roll. But some complain about the production. It was the most obvious aspect of this record. The sound is significantly very muddy and thick. Its a monstrous sound indeed that, despite Casablanca Records trying to find commercial success with Kiss, makes you wonder how they thought the very sludgy sounding production would help that cause. In addition to the flashy Japanese cover art, this was probably the quintessential Kiss album of the time and features more nuggets than probably any Kiss album because a handful of its tunes stopped being performed live over the years or just not done at all. For no holds barred 70s rock at its finest, check this record out.
B001UV4XIS|3.0|This movie has a few skips in it. I dont know why you would sell a movie that isn't playing right.
0439023521|4.0|The only thing wrong with the book was that I didn't get anything else done around the house during the day or so I took to read it. I simply couldn't stop reading. I'm taking a breather in between books 1 & 2 to read the second Fire and Ice book, Clash of Kings. I got both as gifts over the holidays. I'm ordering Catching Fire and Mocking Jay at the same time so I won't have to wait for shipping or the hold list at the library. I've checked on Indigo and Shoppers and the books are 2x the price of Amazon. Cheap is good.

B001LMU182|5.0|I first heard rumblings about this film in 1990 and, not being a fan of anime, didn't pay too much attention. Just out of curiosity, I rented a copy on VHS at my local Blockbuster later that year. Now, bear in mind that my only exposure to Japanese anime was through shows such as Star Blazers and Battle Of The Planets (Space Batttleship: Yamato and Science Ninja Team Gatchaman in the original Japanese)in my youth. I loved those shows.   So, I popped this obscure little cartoon into the VCR for the first time in 1990 and was dumbfounded. I was awestruck by the visuals and the painstaking attention to detail in every frame. Being a fan of Blade Runner, I couldn't help but note similarities between the world Ridley Scott created six or seven years earlier, and this mind boggling Neo Tokyo that Otomo had created. Granted...it didn't seem to rain as much in Neo Tokyo as it does in the Los Angeles of 2019. This is where the similarities end....  This is a film about the consequences when trying to harness powers that are truly beyond human comprehension. It is the story of a group of troubled teen bikers who, in the midst of civil unrest, stumble upon a military conspiracy that could conceivably alter the course of human evolution and consciousness. Years earlier, a young boy named Akira manifested tremendous psionic energy. When science tried to experiment with such god-like powers, it destroyed the Tokyo of old. Now, housed in a secret containment base beneath an Olympic stadium, Akira lies in wait...as religious fanatics await his messianic reawakening.   In the meantime, a young misfit biker named Tetsuo has a chance encounter with a young boy who had been kidnapped by anti-military activists. Causing him to wreck his bike into a ball of flames, it is discovered that the boy Tetsuo encountered is part of yet another clandestine military/scientific operation in an attempt to delve deeper into the mysterious power of Akira...and to harness it. Tetsuo is taken into custody at the scene, much to the chagrin of his best friend Kaneda and the other members of their little gang.   It isn't much later that Tetsuo himself begins to manifest unspeakable powers that are beyond what the military had expected, nor were they prepared for.   This is just a part of a complex and yet INCREDIBLY well written story. Having not read the manga, but understanding there are volumes, I can only imagine how difficult it had to be to condense such a broad spanning plot...but it does succeed in giving the viewer something new to look at with each viewing. Again, my review is likely oversimplifying the overall scope of the story...but you can get the gist.  Like Blade Runner, it is a film where the look and overall aesthetic is merely icing on the cake. The cake is the deeply thought provoking material and it's underlying themes.   The blu ray transfer is STUNNING and the translation is considerably better than the Streamline Pictures version I saw in 1990.   This is a film any self-respecting sci fi film buff should have in their collection. It is the archetype of modern anime and should not be missed!!!

B0054JZC6E|4.0|great way to burn time if you have nothing better to do. or just want to have a little nit of fun
B0063GORYU|5.0|I play the game everyday. Lots of fun and I have had no issues. No suggestions at this time. Keep them coming.
B000NH7SZ0|4.0|I bought this RAM to upgrade the memory in my HP color laser printer.  It has an ethernet interface so data transfer is quick but that is irrelevant if the printer is processing for extended periods anyway.  The additional RAM helps printer processing move faster for reasonable sized jobs so there is little or no waiting.  Of course, when printing a larger job or one with large images there is still a delay but that is to be expected.
B000WZAE1I|5.0|this movie is cute, unique, and darkly funny. boy likes girl, girl doesnt care, girl asks for proof of love, boy offers to retrieve fallen star, fallen star is really a beautiful woman and i leave you to guess the obvious ending.   oh and i forgot to mention if you eat a fallen stars heart you are basically immortal so there is a evil witch trying to do that. and there is a side story of a few princes killing each other to get to a stone (which is what knocked the star out of the sky) because who ever gets to it first gets to be king. very funny but darkly so.
B005GVF95O|5.0|This is a great app for little kids that teaches hand-eye coordination and spacial recognition. The board puzzles were always a hit with the little ones, and now it teaches it while getting them familiar with technology, too. This is a great app for kids!
B004DMIIVO|5.0|This anime was fun for my entire family with people ages 50 thru 10 watching it together. The story line was well written and the pacing of the movie kept us all engaged. With a quirky family in the movie it was fun to pick out characters and compare them to our own family. If you are looking for a good family movie that isn't saccharine sweet but has a great story instead I would highly recommend Summer Wars.
0316098337|5.0|I found out about Room after hearing an interview with Emma Donoghue regarding Room on NPR. I bought the book the next day, and was immediately sucked into Ma and Jack's world. This book has become one of my all time favorites. The story unfolds slowly at first, but takes you on a ride you won't soon forget. In fact, I found the story and the characters haunt you. You find yourself thinking about them and wondering how they are.  I have loaned this book to my friends who are also avid readers, and they agreed. Simply an amazing story.
B000002KNI|5.0|I'd had some problems locating this CD, but finally found a third party vendor on Amazon who had it.  I believe it might have been an import from the UK, but can't recall for sure.  Nevertheless, if you're a Simon & Garfunkel fan, you'll love this live performance fom Central Park.  It would be great if they'd do another one someday!
B00008G7UJ|4.0|Some were very harsh on this movie for it's aggressive imagry and lushness that was beyond the point of excess, but that is how the director rolls.  In general, this was a very well adapted modern take on this classic.  And, it might help kids who are trying to read Shakespeare for the first time understand the events and what is being said and done.  Such as the famous \\"Do you bite your thumb at me, sir?\\" opening scene between the two rival families - make it gang mentality, which is what it was/is.  And that take on the ending scene was WONDERFUL, even if a little editing was applied here and there to add more tension and a sense of true tragedy to what was about to happen.  Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes are the leads, but neither adds a true spin or something innovative onto their famous parts.  It is still, despite how overdone it's been and outrageously burleque this movie has been, the greatest tragedy / love story ever told.
B004SUDQ4U|2.0|Be careful!  The Editorial Review by Amazon.com explicitly states that you are getting a 282 minute version of the TV series seamlessly edited together, but in the Product Details, it states the runtime is 209 minutes.  The Blu-ray I received in my 2-disc Collector's Set is 208 minutes long, and it is definitely the Director's Cut according to the audio commentary and obviously the runtime.  Well, that, and it says \\"Director's Cut\\" right on the disc itself.  A-Doi.  All I can say as a fan of the film is that the movie is the best sub movie ever made, one of the best war movies ever made, and the Blu-ray is really great 1080p compared to my DC DVD; and the subtitles are much better than on the DVD - little white font instead of the big yellow with black pixelated-bordered font, but I am disappointed of course to not be able to get the 282 minutes on Blu-ray.  I see that Amazon.com is marketing the \\"Director's Cut\\" Blu-ray release for the end of January, and the Editorial Review there say it is the 209 minute runtime DC - so they are able to differentiate between the two, and in this case, are definitely false-marketing. But they will make it right with a refund if you send it back - you just can't get what they say they are selling.  Bummer.<br /><br />**********FIRST EDIT - when I thought they were going to send me the right one after all<br />Below is my first review, but in fairness I must complete the story - I also contacted Amazon.com and despite the return policy stating that they don't accept opened disc returns, their customer service replied within ~2 hours explaining that this was a packaging mistake and that the correct one was being overnight-ed to my residence immediately, along with a return label at their expense.  So - I suggest buyers check the back of the disc set to check the feature length film time and if it says 208 minutes, it is NOT the correct set they are trying to sell.  And since the only way possible for me to know that in advance was to have checked for one tiny little font number \\"208\\" instead of \\"282\\" or actually playing it, as I did, from an otherwise identically packaged disc set, Amazon made this right, and I continue to be a satisfied customer.  P.S. The image quality of the 1080p is out of this world - my eyes were popping out of my head with the details I was able to see.<br />*******************ORIGINAL BELOW******************<br />The Amazon.com description carefully and explicitly states that the two-disc Blu-ray Collector's Set is 282 minutes of footage edited together from the 6-hour TV series, but what I actually received in a package identical to what is shown in the picture, is the 208 minute Director's Cut.  Which I already had on DVD.  I was fooled at first because there are a couple of short scenes not in the 209 minute DVD Director's Cut, and I was not able to watch the movie at one sitting, so I kept thinking \\"time really flies when you enjoy a movie so much\\" - but when I watched one of the special features which showed several of the TV scenes not in my sparkling new Blu-ray \\"Collector's Set\\" I knew I had been duped, and checking the the disc information shows the feature film on this set is 208 minutes.for one tiny little font number \\"208\\" instead of \\"282\\" or actually playing it, as I did, from an otherwise identically packaged disc set, Amazon made this right, and I continue to be a satisfied customer.

B0061IMJBI|5.0|I don't understand why people are saying that this season is not as good as the first. They are dragging some things a bit longer than normal but some things are dragging a bit longer than they should. Still 5 star show though.
B004SCN2F6|4.0|I didnt think much of this game until i actually sat down and got through the learning curve. It's tough at first, but after you getbthe swing of things the game just really picks up and shines.<br /><br />I've spent hours on it and havent lost interest.<br /><br />Try it and you wont be disappointed.
B005MYEPXC|1.0|I'm also having audio problems with this disc in a samsung player, as I see two other reviewers experienced. I've also tried two different blu-rays of this title. VERY frustrating! The opening sequence was beautiful...  Don't know if I'll have to try the standard dvd version to make it work or what it will take, but I am looking forward to it. The critics reviews were very kind to this one.
B004LWZW8I|5.0|One of the best movies I have seen and been impressed with. No really famous actors, so I was not planning on a great movie. I am a guy and even my girlfriend was happy after. I would and will recomend this to my friends! Cannot wait for it to come out!
B004LB59VE|5.0|I would think more than likely that this is a modern classic novel, and to be studied and then restudied in the decades ahead. No wonder it won the Pulitzer in 2010.  Its themes are timeless.  Many paragraphs are as dense as poetry, and these are to be carefully reread and savoured. It is original and innovative and very clever. Not to be taken lightly and probably best to keep it fresh in the mind and to be read through in only a few sittings.  Seldom has a book made me leap up from reading to look for paper and pencil. This one did - here is one short quote that caught my eye and made me jump up from my chair so I could write it down to keep:  \\"Be comfortable in the fact that the ache in your heart and the confusion in your soul means that you are alive, still human, and still open to the beauty of the world, even though you have done nothing to deserve it. And when you resent the ache - remember you will be dead and buried soon enough\\".  English literature is clearly alive and well and growing, especially when little known authors can produce a first novel like this one. Incredible.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|haven't unlocked any yet.  fish/bubble game is very  sticky so i can only go with a three star so far.  looking forward to the manymore tho...
B005F6NA56|5.0|When I first saw that Feist was coming out with a new album I said this to myself: I hate Feist. I hate every pop thing she stands for. I hate her music. And I definitely hate counting in music and music in commercials. But then i heard a few songs. I haven't looked back. It has become clear to me that Feist doesn't care about being poppy, or making a best-selling album (though that is nice). What Feist cares about is musical excellence, and if her at times lighter sound doesn't mesh with what you want that is fine. But she is doing what she wants and taking creative risks. That being said, every song on this record is different, and employs various musical emphases in order to make them so. Sometime the emphasis is on the bass, at other times percussion, and still others on Feist's voice. But in other places the emphasis is on the song writing, but all in just the right spots. I love this CD,, and I have come to respect Feist as a song writer and a s an artist. I highly recommend this album.
B006QKKMBA|5.0|Can I get an amen? Wow!<br /><br />I really loved the first three movies in this franchise. Even though they recycled the same plot with different actors and kills scenarios, I always found them to be very fun. The fourth, however, really dropped the ball. I may have enjoyed a few scenes, but there was a noticeable drop in quality and I was left bitterly distrustful of the series. That said, I had high hopes for this fifth installment which was directed by new blood director Steven Quale, who has never been at the helm of a movie, but assisted Cameron on Avatar. I purchased my ticket willingly and with optimism.<br /><br />Not only did this movie make up for the Shakespearian tragedy of its immediate predecessor, but I enjoyed completely unexpected levels of quality. For one thing, they got some funny actors (David Koechner of Anchorman, Waiting; P. J. Byrne of BET's The Game, Horrible Bosses) who delivered a degree of inter-kill-scene comedy which the other movies lacked. This comedy did not make the exciting anticipation of the next kill any less intense. In fact, these deaths mixed gasp-inducing red herrings, \\"oh my God\\" shocking moments, and comedic 80's-esque execution with excellent CGI effects.<br /><br />P. J. Byrne really stole the show. To look at him, he's clearly no womanizer. But the things he says to woman after woman over the phone remind us of our self-absorbed frat buddies who couldn't be more rude to the opposite sex. Then there's Koechner, whose lines are as great as his death scene in the opening act.<br /><br />Here's an out-of-left-fielder. I actually enjoyed the 3D. This is the first time EVER that I have seen a movie in 3D without disfavoring it to the standard 2D. My Bloody Valentine was carefully made for 3D enjoyment, but it really seemed second to this. The writing, CGI, kill creativity, tactful cast, humor and production value made for a grippingly funny and overall well-made horror flick. For its high-budget-B-horror genre, the greatness of this movie was almost unwarranted. It reminded me of another movie which truly shocked me with overall quality: Jennifer's Body. Both movies may have been deliberately campy, but both also had the actors, writers, direction and effects reserved for films of much greater magnitude and far displaced from the realm of modern horror. Also, the ending, following suit with the rest of the movie, was delivered with a twist so clever that I'll bet no one sees it coming!<br /><br />If you love horror see this movie.ed.

B0054JZC6E|4.0|it is a good game. but the help of game is not good. I can not know how to play some games sometimes.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|fun but don't update the game unless you want to lose all your work. my sister got so addicted she.even got the game.
0783229526|5.0|I wanted to watch this movie cuz i heard about it before and couldnt find it anywhere in my city (that made me want it more haha). So i had to go as far as i could to get it and Amazon helped me A LOT! The only problem was the time it took to get to my house, but i know how this online shopping stuff works.. Thanks a lot Amazon, the movie is so insane thats disturbing!
B00664AM5C|5.0|I'll just start by saying \\"WOW!\\" Sure, this movie had a legion of A-listers including an excellent director, yet still this movie exceeded my already high expectations. While its pace was consistently somewhat slow, the content, in turn, was consistently interesting, socially revealing and gripping.<br /><br />This movie follows the outbreak of a novel and swiftly lethal virus from patient zero. With a short incubation period, the highly contagious strain raises the CDC's concern readily ensued by the panic of the masses. The medical community scrambles in a losing race against time as the numbers of infected and dead patients grow at a staggering pace. Controversy, capitalism, distrust...all are likely products of slowly-solved epidemics.<br /><br />The cast flawlessly conveys the very best and worst of human qualities responding to a deteriorating society and economy. Panic, desperation, fear and altruism are all tactfully delivered with humbling realism. Adding to the already palpable emotions of the characters was the tension-setting music which, coupled with the concept of this movie, shall haunt my thoughts. More than once I questioned how I would react in these situations.<br /><br />This gets a solid \\"A+\\" without question and I imagine that this will be an Academy Award nominee for set design and music, if not more.
B004US4K2C|4.0|Go Launcher EX works great on both my Kindle Fire and my HTC T-Mobile G2 (though honestly I find more uses for it on my G2...more apps being the only reason).  Sadly, it's not available in the Amazon Market, so you'll have to side-load it...which isn't that big of a deal.  On the Fire, you have to switch back to the classic Kindle launcher to read books, so I just don't set a default loader and it asks me every time I hit the Home button which launcher I want to use.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Love the plans offered, also makes a great reminder to read the Bible, so the devil has a harder time convincing you otherwise. Definitely recommend this to others!!!
B006MHWXMS|2.0|Update - Reviewed on Jan. 21, 2012 - 2 Stars  Previously, I had given it a 3 star; now it has dropped to a 2 star.  Please FIX the stated issues.  Besides the ringtone being defaulted to \\"Silent\\", numerous issues evolved since the update on Jan. 6, 2012 by the developer.  - Can't delete photo attachments  - Although it is in beta, map feature does not work  - Ringtone defaults to \\"Silent\\"  - A completed task that was marked at 7:19 pm PST on Jan. 4; it marked it completed on Jan. 5.  - Reminders does not work after the update  - When you have a due date & a reminder set; then go back to change the due date; the reminder setting disappears  **Hoping future enhancements include having Categories 1, 2, 3 that goes along with Priority, can assign a color, able to move/rearrange the tasks within the task folder (just like the task list).  Reviewed on Jan. 4, 2012 - 3 Stars  A completed task that was marked at 7:19 pm PST on Jan. 4; the app marked it completed on Jan. 5.  In addition, the reminder ringtone needs to be fixed.  I have a couple tasks & I went into settings to set the reminder ringtone.  After setting it & going back to review the ringtone, it was defaulted back to \\"Silent\\".
B006JPS1OM|2.0|I found that the touch screen function doesn't work well with this game which is unfortunate as you have to use it a lot. I had to uninstall due this. As for the storyline. and gameplay I got to chapter two and it seemed interesting. Bummer that it didn't function properly.
B0057567P0|1.0|I bought this item at the end of October, did not even open it until mid-December, and has since fried 3 hard drives.  I used this in a brand new 17\\" Macbook Pro, initially with a Seagate 7200rpm 1tb usb 3.0 desk drive.  Working great for first five minutes, got a hard drive has been disconnected error message, and plugged it back in.  Worked fine for another 5 minutes, same thing happened again.  Happened about 2 or 3 more times until drive fried.  Of course, I lost a bunch of my clients' important information.  I tried a Western Digital portable drive which did the exact same thing, even with the 3.5mm power adapter plugged in.  Great for five minutes, error message, try plugging in again, wait a half hour to load, great for five minutes, error message.... until yet again another drive goes dead.  Again, tried, with a third drive (I REALLY wanted that USB 3.0 option on my Mac) with an Echo ExpressCard via thunderbolt, and the SAME THING.  Sonnet will not refund the product, and as this is outside the 30-day return policy from Amazon, I can't return it either.  I will again attempt to contact Amazon and Sonnet for a refund considering this is more than unacceptable.  Do not purchase this for your Mac.
B005RAO0GS|1.0|This whole album (as is her first album) is simply a subtle (and at times, not so subtle) promotion of Illuminati/occult ideology. Both her lyrics and videos vividly describe it. She is trying to tell us who really controls her. If anything, it's quite depressing that such a talented singer felt the need to sell he soul for success.
B0041OOJNU|1.0|En estos tiempos de música desechable es una pena escuchar un talento tan único, original e internacional como el de Shakira produciendo semejante disco. Es espantoso y lo peor que ha hecho..
B005ARYEPK|2.0|I made a huge mistake with this purchase. I thought I was getting the new version and paid for express post to make it for a Christmas gift.  Shock - horror when I opened the parcel to find the 1984 edition enclosed. Of course the original was a great movie but over 28 years how   many times can you watch the same old stuff. I guess I wasn't as disappointed as much as the receiver. It will be cheaper to buy the new  version locally when it hit the shops, without the postage, so it was another lesson learnt.
B006RUJST6|5.0|I usually prefer horror novels, but this was a great read.  I was drawn in and was unable to put the computer down.  I loved how real the story felt to me and made me weep for the character's struggles and laugh at their joys.  I will definitely buy the next book Colleen writes!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Thanks for an amazing app! Free and includes my favorite translation, NCV. Thanks for helping my life and my study of God's word.

B005FITIGO|5.0|My review is short since so many others have already.  I thought this film was great and right on the money on the finance side of things.  I can see how it could have gone down at one of the N.Y. brokerage firms at the start of the financial crisis.  Jeremary Irons, Kevin Spacey and Zachary Quinto were excellent.  This was like Wall Street without the hype, catchy lines or black/white good guy vs bad guy.  It now tops my number one Wall Street movie.
B002T9H2L0|5.0|I love this movie. Good from the first to the last scene. Must have for any movie collector. Shipment came very fast as well.

B005V2EVBQ|5.0|This well-designed cover is very light and gives descent protection to my Kindle Fire. The video on the description page was very helpful in making my decision. With the cover flipped back the Fire is easy to hold in either portrait or landscape positions. When using the stand feature it holds the Fire at about a 45 degree angle and I have not had any problems with it collapsing. Definitely would purchase again.
0756665949|5.0|Personally I think this is a must have for any die-hard Lost Fan. Gives a little bit of info on things not explained before but most of the stuff is pretty well known by a lot of fans. Still, great to have just to have.

B004EPZ0BQ|3.0|This is a great movie, which is why I bought it. But I also bought it because it included a digital copy which does not exist.

I'm very disappointed.<br /><br />Seller - Please do not advertise falsely!!!
1439152799|5.0|Edie is an editor at a small publishing company in England and is a quiet, introverted person, dreading having to tell her mother that she and her boyfriend have split and she will have to find a new place to live. When her mother receives an old letter, delayed 50 years in the post, Edie learns that her mother was evacuated from London in the war and went to live at Milderhurst Castle. Edie, by chance, visits the village, and is surprised to realize that she has been there before. She also finds out that her favorite book as a child, the True History of the Mud Man was written by a resident of the castle, Raymond Blythe. A tour of the castle brings further surprises when she meets the elderly twins Percy and Saffy, and their sister, Juniper, who appears to be suffering from madness/early Alzheimer's. The story of her mother's time at the castle and those of the sisters is told in a series of flashbacks. The sisters have a complex and complicated relationship and rivalry and Edie's relationship with her own family deepens as the story progresses. There are many mysteries and interlocking coincidences within the story and I kept anticipating some magical realism, and while this did not appear, the haunting writing and excellent characterization kept me hooked.

B000FC1HBY|4.0|I have a lot of mixed feelings about this book. To start with the writing is fantastic, but I could do without every detail being described, I don't feel the need to know what everyone is eating every single time for instance. The authors details in the book do make me feel like I am there in the story but it also bogs down the story in parts.<br />I really enjoyed Game of Thrones a lot more then I did Clash of Kings to be honest, I was able to feel more for the story and the characters in the story and while I was anxious to read this one and I get the whole \\"bad guy\\" thing but wow this book was sort of depressing for me! It would have been nice if SOMETHING good happened.<br />I will read the next book but going to take a break and read some other things first.

B000P6YNSE|5.0|One of the weaker seasons of the show but still great all in all. This is the season where they didnt know what to do until ABC gave the writers their wish with 6 seasons. Once they got what they wanted they were able to get back on track.
B003AVPV1O|4.0|just recieved this in the mail and hooked it all up. i bought it so i could have the computer screen on my tv and the computer at the same time. for that purpose it works excellent. my audio cable isn't very long because its an audio and video so its a close fit but it works great. not sure if this is accurate or not but there seems to be a reduction in brightness on both screens...barely noticeable but maybe cause it bogs down the computer with 2 screens. but i'm not sure if thats true or not it just seems like it to me lol so if your looking to have 2 comp. screens or  split it to your tv and computer, as not to hog up the tv, then it works very well. very pleased with this buy!. construction is very very sturdy as well.
B004OFWLO0|5.0|I owned and listened extensively to the 1990 \\"The Complete Recordings\\", and was completely satisfied with that box set until I heard \\"The Centennial Collection\\" on the radio.  What a difference 20 years of technology makes. The Complete Recordings sounded like an old but in good condition 78.  The Centennial Collection, however, sound like Johnson made the recordings just last week.  I never expected that the old masters could have ever been cleaned up to this extent, and it was definitely not a waste of money to buy the same music I already owned.  Now if someone would just do the same for all of Charlie Patton's recordings....
B0054JZC6E|4.0|love the many different types of games fun for all ages great challenges couldn't find a better game for free
B0036EH3WK|5.0|Classic, that all you can say really. Say what you want about the ending, This was one of my favorite shows of all time. If you have never watched before just watch the first episode and try not to finsih the whole series. The set comes with a lot of special features and extras. The coolest thing is the black light that allows you to find secrets within the box. Must have most defiantly.
1451627289|1.0|Stephen King is the Obdurate Past or 842 page warren commissionish Tome  Stephen King's main character, George Amberson, goes back into the past, and finds it obdurate; somewhat resistant to change. Then when he does change it, by killing Lee Oswald (so John Kennedy lives), George Wallace becomes President and the future turns out for the worse.  Stephen King convicts Oswald throughout his whole novel; saying he does not like the way he looks, that he is humor-less, he's heartless, and evil. Then King puts Oswald to death, in an overly dramatized scene, by blowing his head off. I guess this may make Steven King feel better, but, the thing is, the evidence to pin the killings of Kennedy, and Tippet, on Oswald is just not there. King references the principle of Occam's razor; the simplest explanation is usually the right one; ergo Oswald is guilty. Well, somehow I do not think that applies where the CIA is involved; as Oswald was clearly an associate. If Stephen King does not believe that, I have a three word response: Judyth Vary Baker. Mrs. Baker's book Me & Lee clearly establishes Lee Oswald as FBI, CIA, ONI and Mafia connected, and also as a respectable human being; as apposed to `the elephant man'. For those still not convinced, I quote former HSCA investigator Gaeton Fonzi (from his book The Last Investigation),  \\"There is...preponderance of evidence that indicates Lee Harvey Oswald had an association with a U.S. Government agency, perhaps more than one, but undoubtedly with the Central Intelligence Agency\\".  King describes Bonnie Ray Williams (TSBD employee) as a guy who cannot see what's right in front of him; belongs in his fictional town of `Derry'. The other guy who belongs in Derry is Stephen King, himself, for not recognizing the blatant John Kennedy assassination conspiracy.  Then King shows the future as being worse, had John Kennedy lived, and has George Wallace becoming President. Well, these are two eventualities that, to me, are unbelievable, even in the wildest of fictions. So I found these scenarios both ignorant and tasteless. King's novel is America's obdurate past by endorsing the lone nut / magic bullet theories. The average American, not having the time to research the Kennedy assassination, or read a tome like King's, most likely will incorrectly assume that King's age and stature as a novelist, and the imposing size of this tome (novel), denote a certain degree of knowledge and intelligence. Stephen King is the obdurate past. The fact that this novel will be made into a movie, endorsing the CIA position, is an obdurate reality, an iron curtain, that must to be torn down, by all thinking, common sense, American's.  I can not believe that Stephen King has really read that many books on the assassination; he's such defender of the lone nut / magic bullet theory. I think he is in the .01 percent that still believes that ridiculous hogwash; King, and Gerald Posner (lone nut theorist, and on the take from the CIA), are the real lone nuts. King's one helluva a writer, but, his wife, Tabitha (a conspiracy theorist), is the brains in the family. Stephen King has bought into the `lone-nut' theory, put forward by our elected officials, hook-line-and-sinker. On the last page (of his Afterword), Stephen King says, \\"Mostly, however, I stuck to the truth.\\"  All I have to say to that is, \\"WHAT A CROCK OF  XXXX!\\".  The shot at General Walker was from a 30.06 caliber bullet that was changed to a 6.5 caliber, by the Warren Commission, to match a Mannlicher-Carcano; like the one supposedly used by Oswald to shoot the President. Even General Walker protested that the bullet found in his house was not from a 6.5 mm weapon.   The missed shot at General Walker, the backyard photos, and all the CIA impersonations of Oswald, etc, were nothing but shabby attempts to frame the patsy; that history will never buy into; it's all disintegrating by the day.  The Afterword clearly endorses the lone gunman/magic bullet theory and King's job as a Government shill. In reference to King's two word response: Karen Carlin, in the Afterword; who's being $25 short on her rent was Jack Ruby's reason for being, at the Western Union Office, by the Dallas Police Department basement (where Ruby shot Oswald), I have this two word response: CONVENIENT ALIBI. King even says Ruby had a gun on him at the press conference on Saturday, 11/23, at the Dallas PD, but balked on killing Oswald. So, why is it such a stretch for King to believe that Ruby's shooting of Oswald was premeditated on Sunday, 11/24? Jack Ruby was Chicago mafia since the 1940's when he first worked on a political campaign with, the infamous, RICHARD NIXON. Lining up convenient alibis for Jack Ruby was like lining strippers for his nightclub: a piece of cake.  To be fair to King's writing, alone, if I set the milestones of blind implausibility and insanity aside, I did enjoy reading this novel, somewhat. King's characterizations of Marguerite Oswald and FBI agent Hosty were hilarious. The love story of George Amberson and Sadie Dunhill is both touching and heart rending. As Doc Ricketts, naturalist of Steinbeck's Cannery Row, would have said (with his green, shrunken, Chinese head up on the shelf; in a jar of formaldehyde), `it was mildly delightful'. The use of Steinbeck's Of Mice and Men was touching, but, we have got John Steinbeck to thank for that...I also enjoyed King's references to the dance and rock culture of the 1950's and 1960's.  But, on the whole, I was reminded of that big book of fiction, by the warren commission, or Steinbeck's character, Lenny, in Of Mice and Men. So, as George did with Lenny, I think I'll gently take this big ole book down by the river and put it out of its misery...  ...BANG!!!!!!
031617615X|2.0|I am appalled at this ending to the story.  There was so much potential in this story line for Bella and Edward to mature and grow and sacrifice, i.e. the stuff that would happen in a good book.    If the books were written for an older audience, I'd say do whatever the flip you want, Stephanie.  BUT SERIOUSLY- these books are aimed at 11-17 year-old girls.  For most of them, this will be their first graphic intro to pregnancy and childbirth.  And wow, they sure will be scarred for life.   Not to mention, the characters have no.. character.  Yuck.  The choices these characters make won't inspire a young girl to be a better person in any way.  I would not encourage my daughter to read this smut, and if she did anyway, I would be talking with her EXTENSIVELY about the myriad of BAD decisions these young people are making, and how in real life there would be consequences to bad decisions, not endless sugar-coated miracles.    I realize that teen lit needs happy endings.  But I can think of a hundred ways the story could have ended happily, without degenerating into this mess of contradictions.  The characters could have been called on to suffer (I mean true suffering, not gory freaky crap like Bella's birth) and sacrifice some things to get bigger things.  Pedophilia could have been left out, FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE.  And although at first I was pleased with the abstinence aspect of the story, in the end it did get twisted around in a gross way, as other reviewers have pointed out.    Hard to imagine worse messages to young girls regarding self-respect, what to look for in love, and the joys of bearing children.  O yes, and that whole pedophilia thing.  Shudder.  A big flop.

0316067598|5.0|A must read. One of the most insightful read of the men (and women) who serve our country. It gives me new found admiration for all those who serve our country. Gave it to my son to read and he was also moved by the story.

B005GVF95O|3.0|After going through the multiple steps to download the app, it would have been nice if it actually downloaded.  When I did it all again, I got the message that I already owned it. Really! Then where is it?  (Update:  I found it!  Apparently after you get the message that it is downloaded, you have to go to the appp store to instal it.)
B0063IH60K|4.0|Very good app.  I am very happy with how it works on my tablet.  Has all of the features and functions needed.
0060873027|1.0|According to the blurb on the jacket, Crichton was well into the writing of this novel when he died, and Richard Preston completed the story. But after reading it, I can't help feeling that this was one of Crichton's trunk novels (i.e. a novel written long ago but stowed away in a trunk because it wasn't any good). I think that after Crichton's death, someone dug it out of the trunk and asked Preston to complete/polish it. I say this because it is the worst novel that has ever had Crichton's name on it, and I doubt he would have approved of its publication. Richard Preston had done far better also.<br /><br />As for the plot, think of a mixture of \\"The Incredible Shrinking Man,\\" Fantastic Voyage,\\" and several of the worst mutant giant insect B-movies you can think of, and you'll get the general idea. Blechhh. Crichton has written many books about the use and misuse of technology. But in this case, although the time will surely come for nanotechnology, this novel is an absurd cautionary tale that makes little sense. The scientific premises are so flimsy that they're downright ludicrous. The characterization of each research graduate students is one dimensional, and some are so silly that I wished they were all caught in a web and dispatched by a hungry spider in chapter two. The seeming incompetence and lassitude of the Hawaiian police when the first mysterious happenings come to light is surely enough to anger Hawaii's real-life finest.<br /><br />Even if you're an ardent Michael Crichton fan, avoid this one. Why let his (perhaps) last effort leave a bad taste in your mouth?<br /><br />Eileen Rieback
B006MHWXMS|1.0|It crashed like 5 times in a row.. Not very convenient. But when it works it works fine. Astrid is better
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I use this everyday. I have finally completed reading the Bible in a year, which I have never before been successful at. I take notes in church, I love this FREE app! Thanks for the ministry to us, YouVersion!
1932907009|4.0|I really appreciate this book because Snyder literally guides you through the important elements that every GOOD script needs to have.  He shows you how to block out your story on a notebook or a cork board and I have found this method especially helpful in my own writing. If I get stuck--if I ask myself, \\"Okay, what needs to happen next?\\"--I simply go back and review that particular section of his book. You will breeze through Save the Cat because Snyder writes well and with a lot of wit and humor.  You're still going to need to study other books about character development, plot, theme, dialog, etc.; however, this really is one of the best books on story structure.
B001HN690O|5.0|Loved this movie. It's a rare sequel that's somehow better than its originator. Word of warning if you purchase this copy, however, tinytinytiny print on the back says digital copy code may not be valid after 12/13/2012. Also the Kung Fu Panda World 2 free online game memberships (lower right corner of front of the box) must be redeemed by and expires on 04/30/2012.   Just gotta love how they can make sure to put TM and R next to Blu-Ray and Digital Copy, yet don't flag Digital Copy so a person knows to pull out a magnifying glass for fine print on DC expiring at some point.
B004MC8CA2|3.0|Really like multiple versions and ease of use. However I can't use it at church or places without Internet access. If it was usable there. I would give it 5 stars. So I purchased a downloadable Bible.
B005G4TJI4|5.0|This product was exactly what I expected.  Great quality and is one of my favorite movies.  I couldn't pass up the great price either!
0439023521|5.0|I took turns reading this book aloud with my 11 YO daughter.  It's a very interesting book, very violent at times, but keeps you at the edge of your seat.  We enjoyed the characters, but I thought that the premise of the book was at the very least horrifying.  I had second thoughts more than a few times if this was age-appropriate, but my daughter was ok with it.  In contrast to the Series of Unfortunate Events books which she wouldn't even keep in her room, because they gave her nightmares.  There were a lot of words that she didn't know and we'd have to look up, but the kindle app is amazing and all we had to do was touch the word for a definition.  We would often talk about it together.  I've found that reading aloud with my kids helps keep us connected (we read the Harry Potter series aloud too).  We started right into the next book and can't wait to see what happens!
B005G4TJI4|3.0|Heroine was pretty lame, but then again, they didn't ask her to be much other than eye candy. Otherwise, I thought they did a much better job telling the story this time than they did with #2.   As for this particular item itself, I'm really getting upset w/distribution companies who make sure to put TM after Blu-Ray and R after Digital Copy on the front of the cases yet do nothing to denote there's a caveat to the digital copy. Then they put in tinytinytiny print on the back of the box that there's an expiration date for the digital copy installation. I have really good eyesight & I have a very hard time reading this info. For Transformers #3 the gotcha is that its code may not be valid after 09/30/2012.   I wish stores (*cough*Amazon*cough*Best Buy*cough*) selling the products would also make a point of sharing expiration dates in their descriptions &/or covering up the DIGITAL COPY portion of the item once the expiration date has passed as IMHO it's misleading advertising.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Extensive note taking, highliting, bookmarking, ability to share via social media; super easy to &quot;turn&quot; to a desired book, chapter, and verse, and reads to me as I go to sleep at night. With all that ability, it's simple, plain but elegant, and easy to use. I would request that audio be available offline - or be downloadable per chapter from YouVersion. I gladly anticipate future development from the program's creators.
B00003CX8Y|5.0|This two-disc platinum edition Beauty and the Beast was very well worth the price! My children enjoy this movie so much and they even love the new \\"human again\\" song that is also included in the movie. The games on disc 1 and disc two are fun and easy enough for my 4 year old to play without my help. I love the movie and now my kids can love it too it is SO great!
B0044RFT8S|5.0|My son ABSOLUTELY loves this movie. He cracks up laughing all the time. Mind you he is just 16 months. I've tried all different movies ranging from Disney classics to pretty recent movies like Toy Story 3, but he only likes this movie, Madagascar 2, and Monsters, Inc.
B004FRY9BU|5.0|You definitely have to focus on this movie so you don't miss anything. My 12yo son saw it first, fell in love with it, and talked me & his sister into viewing it. We both love it now too.   Word of warning if you purchase this copy, however, tinytinytiny print on the back says digital copy code expired already. Just gotta love how they can make sure to put TM and R next to Blu-Ray and Digital Copy, yet don't flag Digital Copy so a person knows to pull out a magnifying glass for fine print on DC expiring at some point. Then the vendors selling the item also don't bother updating customers that the digital copy has a limited installation window and that window might've actually already passed before you purchase the item. With this item you see DIGITAL COPY on the item's photo and in its description, not realizing you can't get the digital copy now even tho you're paying for that privilege.
B004VQFQ2Q|4.0|Born Again is probably the most maligned album in Sabbath's long history. This review will NOT add to that perception! We all should agree the cover of the album is monumentally bogus and is (for the most part) reviled; Krusher Joule was probably shocked as anyone that it was chosen for release. But the music is a different story; Born Again is a riff-a-rama for any fan of heavy rock. When this album was released in late '83 the face of rock was changing - Sabbath style riffs out; Def Lep-like melodies in - but Sabbath was still able to deliver the goods (sorry for the Judas Priest pun) on this record. Granted, the production at times sounds murky, but the roar of Trashed, Zero the Hero and Keep it Warm more than make up for the dodgy production. I recommend Born Again to any hard rock fan...give it a chance!
030014332X|5.0|It is a pleasure to come about this type of book. Written in a simple and clear manner, Gombrich's book is a marvelous trip through \\"the river\\" that is human history, from an European perspective. I would, no doubt, recommend this book to anyone interested in history, particularly teenagers who are curious about human history in our planet.<br /><br />On the downside, Gombrich fails to address South America and Africa as part of human history. These two regions of the world are ignored throughout the book and just get mentioned when some European interacted with either Africa or South America. Also, one could question the way in which Gombrich presents Jewish and Muslim history. Not objective in some parts of the book.<br /><br />Read this book and enjoy a wide and inspirational perspective of human journey since prehistory.
B005GVF95O|5.0|Quite simply a decent game for young kids. Works well. Does what it says, reliable.  I didn't download it for me.  And my neice and nephew enjoy it, 3 and 5.    5 is a little old for this app, for her anyway.  I'm not going to complain about how the FREE app of the day ruined my life again...  waaaa..  I think some people really need to reexamine their so called lives.    He'd probably give easy-tether a 1 star.  And strip poker a 2 star (I only say 2 because I don't think he can rate anything higher, because thats all the higher he can count) for not having good enough graphics or not having some physical interaction attachments..  or just loving him they way he needs love...  I think SM75 recently reviewed an app that said  &quot;not for tablets&quot;. and gave it a 1 star because it  didn't work on his tablet,.. duh!?   he needs to be banned as a user.
B005GVF95O|3.0|It's a ok app for 2 to 3 years old kids however its not challenging for kids older than 4. They can breeze through 14 levels like saying the alphabets. So please add more levels for the ages accordingly. Definitely not for 5, or 6 years old kids though as they lost interest very quickly after a couple. Kids are smarter in this generation. Thanks.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I got this for my kindle fire and I love it.  I have to that Rovio has really out done them self's on this classic game!
B003Y5HWK4|5.0|[[ASIN:B003Y5HWK4 Boardwalk Empire ]] is fantastic. You expect one thing and get another,in Boardwalk's case this is not a bad thing. Quite the contrary. With exceptional writing and production by creator Terence Winter and Martin Scorsese. Stand out performances by Steve Buscemi as Enoch \\"Nucky\\" Thompson and Michael Pitt as James \\"Jimmy\\" Darmody HBO brings to the home viewer another exceptional hour of pure entertainment that I have not seen since the likes of The Sopranos. Let's just hope we have all learned a lesson with the untimely demise of [[ASIN:B00129AJFO Deadwood ]].<br />I could go on and on but this is one series that must be experienced to appreciate.Try to imagine The Sopranos juiced on Deadwood(minus the profanity) in the roaring 20's during prohibition & bootlegging with a little murder,explicit-sex and mayhem.<br /><br /> \\"You can't be half a gangster, Nucky. Not anymore.\\" Jimmy Darmody
0312641893|5.0|I'm wow-ing at how inventive, creative, and exciting CINDER by Marissa Meyer is!! I honestly didn't think that I was going to like it because I wasn't too sure how robotics would play out in a Cinderella twist, but Oh My Grease Monkeys I was so wrong! So wrong that I ended up paying for it with dark circles under my eyes. I started reading Cinder at around 11pm and next thing I knew day break was peeking through the curtains. Well worth the all-nighter, and will definitely not disappoint!!<br />The unexpected action pack and drama/suspense had me glued to the pages. I never once needed a bookmark! Although I knew where the plot/climax was going, I totally didn't mind because the written layout has you wanting the events to build up to that point. Enjoying every detail, struggle, and anxiety inducing tale of Linh Cinder!<br />I love how the introduction of non-earthen characters, the mixing of humans, and human hybrids (cyborgs & androids) made an enjoyable and imaginative twist to a well loved classic fairy-tale, Cinderella. Cinder by Marissa Meyer is no doubt on par if not exceeding the greatness of its classic!<br />I will be looking forward to sharing the adventure and the thrill of delving back into the Lunar Chronicles in Book #2! A brilliant 2012 MUST READ Debut!!
B004RJMUJO|4.0|Please update as frequently as you do with the iOS version. Otherwise, this game has a high replay value and is very fun!
B003L20IHE|4.0|this was a touching movie. It had us girls crying and couldnt get away from the movie. we watched it from the beginning to the end
B0063IH60K|4.0|Love this classic game, but hate that each ad has a pop up window that you have you exit out of before you can play the hand.
0761158820|5.0|I purchased this for my 6 year old grandson for Christmas. He loves art and is always doing what he considers \\"projects\\". He loves this book. out of all the toys he got for Christmas he uses this one the most. We help him sometimes with the instructions but most of the time he puts them together entirely on his own.It keeps him busy for hours. I think the book is great for problem solving.Love it. Now we are looking for a dinosaur one.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I haven't had any problems with this app. I really like the way they display the weather: Samsung epic, and a V7 android tablet running 2.3
B000W0B0G6|5.0|I had the good fortune to see Cat Stevens live in concert when this album was first released... It was a very magical moment and one that I will never forget... He is an extremely talented singer and songwriter, and this album belongs on everyone's MUST-HAVE list... Every single song is beautiful, moving, and well worth listening to many times over. Yes, some people may have qualms about his conversion to Islam (many people actually burned his records!), but change comes to all people, and if he decided to find peace in a different religion, that in no way diminishes the wonderful legacy he gave us... This is probably one of the best albums of all time... I may not agree with some of his new beliefs, but I will always LOVE this album and the music he created... HIGHLY RECOMMENDED...
0060763280|1.0|I've read two of T. Harv Eker's books and he has failed as an author in both attempts. I wasn't going to write a reveiw for this book until I unintentionally realized as I was comparing two terrible books that just finished within a month of each other were written by him. Money is inheritently connected to psychological behavior, however it isn't a deep seeded root of your subconscious whether or not you 'have what it takes to be a millionarie' as this book implies. Both of his books seem liked rushed attempts at self-help or personnel development and both missed the mark and made zero postive impact on my life. I'm just happy that Amazon let me buy the used version so atleast I didn't waste as much money as I could have. Stay away from this author and read The millionarie next door, and the Rich Dad Poor Dad series, and you'll find yourself getting the information that T. Harv Eker tries to present but fails.
B001P06GX4|5.0|I went to visit my six year old son at his school and his teacher introduced me to Blokus. I ordered one from Amazon as a Christmas gift for our family. We have had the best time playing! We've started family game night where we ditch the TV, actually eat in the dining room and then play games. Or should I say game. We haven't played anything other than Blokus. I'd recommend this for anyone at any age.
B006JPS1OM|4.0|well why does it take a while to load and it looks like a good game for children. its fun to play

B005GVF95O|5.0|The joy of the free app is the variety, the anticipation, wondering what will  pop up when I hit that button. Sometimes good, sometimes bad, sometimes meh. But whatever it is, then there is the joy of finding what superman 75 has said today. Comedy is hard people, sp 75 writes a new bit every day. I wonder who he really is and when he will get his own show.
B004HO6I2E|2.0|The Change Up starring Jason Bateman and Ryan Reynolds wasn't exactly what I expected! Yes, there were a few moments where I simply laughed out loud, but others where I kind of shook my head. Childhood friends Mitch (Reynolds) and Dave (Bateman) have secretly envied each others' lives. Mitch is a free minded actor who goes thru his life with no responsibilities or consequences for his actions. Dave is a successful attorney with a wife and kids, who thinks the grass is greener on the other side, which in this case would be the life of his free spirited friend. Wishing for the others' life, Mitch and Dave chant their desires while urinating in a fountain in the park. Waking to find themselves in the others' body, they each set to have what they always desired. Through a series of misadventures.....and there are several...they learn to appreciate what they have. Dave learns that success and wealth won't bring you happiness if you don't take the time to appreciate those who love and care for you; while Mitch learns that ignoring his responsibilities; being promiscuous; and smoking pot gets a little old as you get older.   Overall, the movie was ok and somewhat entertaining, and in the end, the theme was clear....\\"the grass is not always greener\\" or \\"appreciate, cherish and be grateful for what you have\\".  And finally, while I thought I selected the theatrical version, there were some scenes that contained nudity and or sexual innuendo. The \\"F\\" word was also used liberally.  So this movie isn't necessarily for kids and depending on your rules, it wouldn't necessarily be appropriate for your teens.
B005Y423ZC|4.0|Its awesome. I love her voice. Great material. The quality is perfect. The sound is great. I totally recommend this dvd.

B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is fun when i get bored or cant sleep!! i really like it...i just wish some of the games were a little easier..
B005J6LKVI|4.0|I bought this Blu-Ray/DVD set as a gift for my wife who'd already seen the movie. We watched it together, and I was entertained, amused, and yet horrified. The film portrays some of the deeply disturbing examples of the segregation and racial discrimination rampant in the South of the 1960s, and even these watered down portrayals are horrifying. But, the film also portrays the warmth and humor of the more heroic characters. I admired the talent of the entire cast, but Bryce Dallas Howard's Hilly Holbrook was thoroughly convincing as a racist member of upper middle class Mississippi society. I definitely recommend seeing this movie, and the Blu-Ray disc's deleted scenes make getting the movie on Blu-Ray worthwhile.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this application.is.a.very fun application.  keeps you entertained when you are bored. I recommend. this app to people that get bored Bc there is so much to do. and I like.it because you can keep unlocking new games that are just as fun as the last one.

B0001ARCFA|5.0|Not a professional just know what sounds good, compared AKG Acoustics k240 to Sennheiser hd280 Pro at a local Sam Ash along with several other headphones, except Grado SR 60i, using the IPod Touch for which they will be used with. The Sennheisers, a closed headphone, had a greater range of loudness n were quite crisp, but very uncomfortable! The AKGs, a open headphone, were less loud but a warmer sound and extremely comfortable. Found open design needed for listening to books n music while driving, COMFORT then sound made decision easy. Plenty of pros have reviewed this product, not doing studio work, just listening. Like eyes of the beholder so are ears of the beholder. As a side note they keep the ole ears warm too!
B003JTHXOK|3.0|I love Nicholas Sparks books, I have almost all of them. This stroy somehow, wasn't very good. I bought this, because of the reviews, was VERY UNHAPPY. The end was how I expected it, and some of it was very unreal. I DO NOT RECOMEND THIS BOOK.....he has better stories!!!!

I was very doubtful that this wireless transmitter would work well from any decent distance away from my iPod and be able to provide good clear sound for my wireless headphones; however after getting the transmitter and using it I am now a true believer. I plan on buying an additional one for my wife's iPod real soon.

B005K17RU0|5.0|really like this weather app. has all info. one could need. I would highly recommend this as your choice for a weather apply.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|these games are fun and some challenging. but really I'm rating just to get the points.  but some of the games are kinda dumb.
B005HEQ2SI|5.0|I thought it was rather enjoyable to see a different side of Troi.  Instead of simply being background noise, she finally gets to shine in the spotlight, and show her vulnerable side, and her own feelings for once instead of worrying so much about everyone else.
B005GVF95O|2.0|Since the purpose of a review is for the individual writing said review to tell how THEY liked the app in question (as opposed to telling how their three year-old liked it), I've gotta say that I really don't care much for this app.  WAY too simplistic...I could probably finish all that there is to do here in less than 5 minutes even if I had a debilitating hangover.  Can't imagine actually spending money on this title unless you're desperate for something to preoccupy you while you crap your diaper.  And to Superman75...while some of your ridiculous yarns are amusing, how 'bout a compromise with those of us who value the rating system?  That is to say, why not write whatever you like about the apps here (which you apparently already do) while giving them the ratings they truly deserve?  This one is a 2-star app at the very least.  :p
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Now there's no excuse not to read the Bible. Your phone is always with you, so put a Bible (or a slew of them) on your phone and read anytime.
B005OOSPZO|5.0|Long time fan of Tora Tora Tora and love the blue-ray version. Picture quality is super and the extra scenes makes this the most enjoyable version.
B00005JMFQ|5.0|A great product that made a wonderfully well received Christmas gift. I would recommend this film to any Christmas romantic.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this app is really fun, but for some of the games the controls are hard to understand/do. Also the game always has ads popping up. I just got the game and I've hit about 4 ads on accidebt already.
B0041TM3LA|5.0|As most of these were on the old Clef label it was good to have them in one box.five of the discs are from the song book series which Norman Granz did with a few in his stable.Oscar together with Ray Brown & Ed Thigpen were at the height of their powers & went on to do many great things. Well worth the money.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I absolutely love this app.  It enables me to quickly have access to the Word and whatever translation I need.  A must have!!
B005K17RU0|4.0|I got this primarily for the widget and it works well.  I would have given it 5 stars if the widget didn't waste home screen real estate with the web address.
B0060AY6FO|3.0|It's virtually impossible not to compare the Austen characters in P.D. James' Death Comes to Pemberley with their original personifications.  If you are reading the book to recreate the feeling you might have had the first time you read Pride and Prejudice, then you might be initially disappointed with this novel.  P.D. James took the original characters and wrote them from a different point of view.  That's not a bad thing, but don't read this book and expect it to be a seamless sequel to Pride and Prejudice.  it's not.  It's a period murder mystery which uses previously created characters and their histories to shape a completely different type of story.  If you have already read Pride and Prejudice, you might be slightly bored during the first chapter.  I was expecting to be thrown right into the action.  Instead, it felt like the beginning was a slow rehash of things which any reader of Jane Austen already knows about the history of the characters.  You can't really skip the first chapter either as it does aid in the set up  of the overall story.  But if you start reading and think that the beginning is sluggish, have patience.  The pace of the storyline picks up tremendously in a very short while.  Having said that, I don't think I can emphasize enough that this book shouldn't be compared with Pride and Prejudice.  Same characters, yes.  Same tone, no.  As far as the mystery angle goes, I think it's a nice story with a few twists that reflect the period in which the story is set.  I can't say much else as this is my first P.D. James novel.  So I can't compare it with any of her other works.  Bottom line - if you like period pieces and mysteries, this should be a satisfying read.  If you liked Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy, this can also be an enjoyable read as long as you aren't expecting to read the characters in the same tone of voice or having the same concerns any longer.  These characters are older.  Their priorities have shifted, and that's reflected as well inthe storyline.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I was very interest in buying a cover for my new Kindle Fire I received for Christmas and decided to order the Marware MicroShell Folio Black Cover and well after I placed my order I started looking on Amazon for customer reviews. Much to my surprise when I placed my order there was an alarming amount of negative reviews and I started to feel a little bit of buyers remorse over my purchase, but decided to hold out until it shipped before I made my final judgement over this product. I am very glad I did, because this product is great so far, and really don't understand what was the cause for the negative hype. I had read lots of reviews say the stand function of this case was poor and was barely usable, but I am very happy to report everything is great, stand and all. The case has a very sung fit for the Kindle Fire and has a very sleek look, its light weight and have been using the stand as advertised. I am really impressed with this case and don't see another case on the market for the Kindle Fire I would rather have.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|good fun with the kids. son really enjoys all the games that are available. casual fun games to waste time
0767817478|5.0|Awesome Movie and I mean seat of your pants action! This is the American version of basically, \\"Godzilla eating New York\\". I loved it. Bit of Nostalgia is the twin towers of the Trade Center glistening in the Sunset. Beautiful. Loved the movie and you will too.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|annoying you have to wait to get everything... other that that its okay. good time waster if nothing else Lol ha
B00308YN2U|3.0|Very dark movie. Geez, did Hogwarts go \\"Green\\" and quit using electricity or something. The whole thing has a dark and ha a despairing atmosphere. Nothing funny or fun about the movie. There is no PigWidgeon the little Owl Sirus had left Ron there is so much missing. As I remember in the book Dumbledore hit Harry with a spell that petrified him when Snape was going to kill him because he knew Harry would come to his aide. Not this time. This time Harry was hiding behind a chair. Did not like the Movie and from the reviews above mine I think I will wait for the Deathly Hallows 1 and 2 to go down to a penny before I ever buy them. If you haven't read the books you will probably like it if you have and are a fan you won't I can guarantee that.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its fun to pass time and some what addicting.. ive been trying to unlock all the games just to see what comes up next
0141439572|5.0|The book was in perfect condition. There was no writing or highlighting in the book. The cover was hardly damaged. Would definitely buy from again.
B005T87QCI|1.0|this app is supper easy it took me less than a hour to beat this. also this app does not have all of the robots from real steel. it dose not have atom or sues so it stinks.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I didn't know what to expect but I have lots of fun with this game. It's free I like it
B0063GORYU|5.0|Once you play it once and win you instantly get hooked. At first when I started playing I lost a couple times but quickly the hang of it. A good game to play when you want to just relax
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I really love this. I like how I can choose that version I want to read and have the oppourtunity to compare - that's really cool.
B004SUWR2C|5.0|get this game no matter what but make sure you get it for the kindle fire the multi-player is incredible
B0063IH60K|4.0|I love solitaire. it's one of my favorite games. It can keep me busy for hours. Fun for all who play.
B0063IH60K|5.0|A challenge at times but still beatable. Good way to pass tome. It is easy to use and cant beat that it's free!
B006PAZMMK|4.0|Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites was such a huge album, possibly an album that forever will be the threshold Skrillex has set for himself. I like this new album but it didn't have as much as an effect as SM&NS had on me; which could just possibly be just me and not the album. I am more exposed now to that \\"Skrillex\\" style as of late.<br /><br />That being said this is still a good album.<br /><br />The production quality on this album is a tad more polished it seems than his older releases, which is not something I totally love. I liked the gritty-ness of he older releases (My name is and SM&NS).  It lends itself well to the whole BROstep vibe.<br /><br />So far none of the songs have particularly struck me. The collab with The Doors felt a bit odd on the part of The Doors but the result is pretty sweet. Although it kind of reminds me of your old uncle (slightly creepy but still pretty damn cool) trying to play beer pong with all your younger[er] friends.<br /><br />My fave tune of the whole album is Right On Time, the one that features Wolfgang Gartner, but I still tend to prefer solo Skrillex tunes and solo Wolfgang songs...<br /><br />I am not sure how to describe it, I am somewhat disappointed in this release as a fan. I am all for artists evolving and exploring new stuff but for me personally the album fell a bit short of what I was expecting. I am hoping that this is just the calm before the storm and his next album will be SICK NOICE and be released on his own label (OWLSA) instead of Big Beat...and that he is saving all the incredible stuff for that release!<br /><br />Anyway if you are a Skrillex fan, I am sure you will like the album and music is such a subjective thing that one person's letdown might not be another. Even using the word letdown sounds to extreme for my feeling, it really is a good album!!<br /><br />That sums it up...GOOD ALBUM, buy it:D
B005GVF95O|5.0|My research shows AR Entertainment is a small firm dedicated to making childrens education apps for mobile devices.  In the other big venue ARE has 32 apps available.  They have a lite version of this one so you can see if it works on your antique device. This, like their other apps, is polished and well done.  The lite version of this app has 50K dls, and a 4.3 rating. I appreciate this vendor and their decision to give up the small income on this app for today in retun for some exposure on the FAotD.<br />I'm concerned that the quality of apps being offered here will decline as vendors grow disenchanted with the self promoting, attention starved, jokesters who's constant 1 star ratings expose their malicious intent.  If we want to see good apps here we must stop acknowledging trolls, not encouraging them. FAotD could easily add the Helpful/NotHelpful/Abuse comment review choice to this rating system to the problem.<br />This is one app vendor I really want to support.  They do good work for our kids. I am going to buy one of their other childrens apps as a way to thank them for their participation in FAotD,<br />Thanx for reading my off-rating comment.  This is not supposed to be a blog but I like free apps and want to see FAotD continue to thrive and get quality apps. Please FAotD give us the tools to flag the trolls!!<br />UPDATE: I see now that its the Android app version of FAOtD that is lacking the abiity to flag trolls.  Please use the website to flag trolls as unhelpful, abuse, and comment on comments.  Unfortunately you can 'ignore user' only for users who comment on ratings  by others but you cannot ignore the user who posts the original review.  FAOtD  should fix that so I can click 'ignore user' next to any reviewers name.  Thanx.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its fun because you have a whole bunch of games! I play every day I have it on my ipods too.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Works as you would want, able to check multiple locations with extended forecasts or not, and remembers those you choose to record.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is incredibly addicting. some of the games aren't my favorite but there are so many that there is a little something for everyone
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Beautifully delivers numerous versions of the Bible at your fingertips, perfect. The fact that this app is free....priceless. Great on Kindle Fire.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I find myself getting frustrated and playing the game for hours trying to beat the different games. I cant help but play.
B004EPYZTE|3.0|It came well wrapped and in a timely manner as is typical for Amazon.  I have two DVD copies of these films (because I am too spoiled to get off the couch and turn over the 2 sided disc in my DVD carousel).  The pictue and sound on these BDs are both superior to the DVDs.  Problem is that my BD carousel does not like the second (Destroyer)disc very much.  I have to load it many times before the disc player accepts it.
B0064J6OMO|2.0|This was different but unfortunately not great. It was predictable, gross and the characters in my opinion where too flawed and almost unbelievable. Mitch Planko (played by the always funny Ryan Reynolds)seemed fake and a man who was so stupid, empty emotional and selfish that you do not feel any type of empathy for him, the growth of his character was almost invisible.<br /><br />You start the movie with a dumb guy, you finish the movie with a dumb guy with a hot girlfriend, a very smart Sabrina McArdle (played by Olivia Wilde). And you know a woman like that will probably never end up with a shell of a man like Mitch Planko (even if it looks like Ryan Reynolds)<br /><br />Some funny jokes, weak story... I give it 2 stars.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Use everyday, must have, one of the best Bible apps out here! Absolutely love this app! Have on all my mobile devices as well as my pc!
B006IGZWB2|5.0|Originally I though this might not be a movie for me, I though it will be possibly slow and sad... I heard really good things about it so I decided to give it a shot and boy I am glad I did, this movie really touched my heart and made me laugh in parts, cry in others. I though the performance was really well done, the script adaptation was good, and it was just overall a great movie.<br /><br />I give it 5 starts.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|It is a great game to pass time!!! challanging also, my kids and I really enjoy trying to beat the game!
B00650SSWG|3.0|I knew the end of this movie before I even watched it, I knew it even before watching the trailer, but decided to watch it in my free time for a bit of love and entertaining. As of romantic comedies goes I must say this one it's different, I like the fact that they went a different route to show two friends falling in love and the issues that come with it.<br /><br />I am just happy I did not spend money to watch it in the theater!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Fun and easy to play. Never gets boring because there is always a new challange. Games are easy enough for kids or beginners.
B0060V1WJ6|4.0|I loved this movie, it is fun to watch, sweet story lines and the acting it's very well played. I loved how they show 3 different stories that are very complicated of every generation and at the end they are all connected. Super sweet movie.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love being able to compare so many other versions with just a tap of my finger. At first I didn't realize that I would have to download the versions I wanted in the event I was without wifi. I once spent over $200 for an audio Bible. Now I can listen, read, or search anytime and it's so simple. I've noticed that it works better on my Kindle than on my ipod touch, though. Thank you, thank you, thank you for an awesome app!
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|Hoping for a quick sequel!!  Am dying to read about her life in the 1500's.  I would recommend this book to anyone and have.
0515142247|2.0|Previously read Killing Floor and found it to be pretty good.  This book is not as good.  It does the job as your typical hard guy mystery with the obligatory twists, but the plotting, number of characters, and level of detail are needlessly overcomplicated.  Near the end, the narrative switches faster and faster between the viewpoints of half a dozen people, and the book becomes more like reading a flowchart than a novel.  And, there is some just plain bad writing here.  The book starts out with choppy, 3- to 5-word sentences that I found annoying.  Average sentence length does grow as the book progresses, but not by much, and the writing never does become anything like fluid.  Or, as the author might say, The writing is choppy.  3- to 5-word sentences.  This is annoying.  It gets better.  But not great.  Just a little better...  Every character speaks with the same voice, in the same short staccato sentences.  This is an adequate story (even though backwoods militias had been overdone by the time this was written), but the style was just all wrong for me and made the book a tiresome read.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|God comes first! Thanks for having the idea of allowing millions of people to read the Bible on their phones or tablets.
B000QCS8TW|1.0|The entire typeset for the kindle version is atrocious. The editing was done so poorly that most of the sentences make absolutely no sense and it seems as if its not quite written in English, or any variant of it! Overall the kindle version is not only bad but it's a disgrace to the book as it discourages new readers!
B005GVF95O|5.0|This is great for my 2 year old. Perfect for keeping her occupied at the store or in Church etc. Thanks to Amazon for offering applications for all ages. The ones that complain about it being a kid's app don't know the value of giving a kid something that is fun, educational &amp; will keep them busy. Maybe when they grow up &amp; have kids they'll understand.
B005GVF95O|4.0|ok first this isn't a bad app yeah its for kids. what do you expect for the faotd. they cant make every top app free. and the guy who got kicked out of the move 1. we don't really care and 2.maby if you would spend time with you kid instead of being on your kindle your life might be a little bit better. quit smarting of to people and learn some respect. sad a 15 year old is telling you this.
B005K17RU0|4.0|i like the hour by hour feature and the satellite imagery the most. and the forecast is accurate! go figure.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|its so addictive, my dad loves this app.its just overall great. so great I got the seasons version too. I cant wait for more.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I use this app on my Kindle Fire.  If it had a dictionary or concordance linked to it, I'd give it a 5 star rating.
B003L77GG0|3.0|After hating season 9, I was hoping 10 would make up for it.  It didn't.  It was ok, but not enough to make up for the rest.  Wishing now I had never bought ANY of the seasons.
B004YEJGEO|4.0|This puzzle is very fun and the look of it is done very nicely as well. so far the puzzles are getting challenging as the levels progress, but I'm only halfway through sector 2 so far.
B006AZZPCM|1.0|Every video I try to download produces the error &quot;invalid video id&quot;.  I tried it with videos which I was able to download with another application.  This ap also does not close,  even though it has an exit button.
B0063IH60K|5.0|it is exactly what I expect from this classic card game!  if solitaire is what you are looking for, look no farther!
B0063IH60K|5.0|this is a great version, both for time killing and ease of use. it is very easy to jump right in and start right in with easy to play and sometimes challenging.
0345522478|5.0|I absolutely love this new series.  Hounded, Hexed and Hammered are all excellent reads.  In fact, the only bad thing about them is they did not help my insomnia--it was hard to put them down even when I finally could sleep.  As soon as I finished, I handed the books off to my husband who reads a fraction of the books I do.  He came home from a busy 1 week trip having finished the first two and is now half way through the third.  These 3 books are a great first trilogy by new author Kevin Hearne who mines his Irish American heritage to bring the Irish pantheon and his hero the Iron Druid to life.  Atticus (not his original name) O'Sullivan looks 21 but has 100 times that life and magic experience.  As the last surviving Druid in modern America, he has adapted well and has mad skills but also has a lot of baggage from his past--some of which is coming back to to bite him.  Featuring great fight scenes, a beautifully structured and explained version of Druid earth magic and the wonderful \\"talking\\" Irish Wolfhound Oberon, the books are fast paced, funny and clever. In the subsequent books Hearne and his Iron Druid explore witchcraft and the Norse pantheon with equal skill.  I can't wait for the fourth Tricked due April 2012.
B004UXUX4Q|5.0|This is a great family film that's R-rated. In it, even little kids say words that would have had my grandmother beating them with a stick for uttering. And yet, honest to Pete, in every other respect it's a wonderful PG-13 family film that endorses family, integrity, good parenting.<br /><br />And it's a really good movie by cinematic standards, wholly apart from the values it promotes. I once heard that casting was 80% of a movie. If so, \\"The Descendants\\" wins big time because the casting is flawless. George Clooney sinks into his character--which is tough to do when you're such a big star (and you look like Jay Leno's handsome first cousin). You really see him as his character, and his voiceover narration actually works, unlike many voiceovers.<br /><br />But the first class casting extends down to the smallest parts--the sign of a fine movie. And the second role, the hero's rebellious daughter, is played with real distinction by Shailene Woodley, previously only known as the lead in the CW network's teen soaper/weekly abstinence infomercial \\"Secret Life of the American Teenager.\\"<br /><br />The film is set entirely in Hawaii--mostly in the Oahu of those who live there and have lived there for generations, in a suburban lifestyle that looks very much like mainland suburbia except that even the wealthiest families in the fanciest get-togethers are all barefoot. It's pretty cool, really.<br /><br />Hawaii is one of the best pieces of casting--casting because it comes one of the main characters, providing a backdrop for the human players who are all--hence the title--the descendants of haoles from the mainland and local Hawaiians who intermarried.<br /><br />One character who has precious screen time is Matthew Lillard, who I only knew of from his role in the Scooby Doo movies--that is, as a rubber-faced buffoon. But here in a small role he does a great job portraying a quasi-slimeball who isn't quite as bad as we're led to think. And Judy Greer, playing the character's wife, does an equally great job with a small role.<br /><br />The cinematography is competent if not cutting edge. It's aided by being set in Hawaii. Hard to lose with that one. I've been there several times, and the film really took me back. I could smell the warm, humid air and how it makes the main character (Clooney's) sweat when he runs for a while.<br /><br />This film has gotten rave reviews from the critcs and from audiences. You will do yourself a favor if you see it based on those and this, without trying to find out all the details of the movie. You can get the whole plot easily enough, since most reviews tell the whole story most of the time. I'm trying to help preserve some element of surprise for you here, while still telling you whether you should see it, and whether in a theater or not.<br /><br />As for that, my rule of thumb is to only see 3D films in theaters rather than on my 46\\" flat screen home theater. This film isn't 3D, but I happened to see it in a theater. Some people I saw it with thought the Hawaiian setting was enough to justify seeing it in a theater. I dunno, but that is an argument for it. But I don't think you'll feel bereft if you wait for the DVD.<br /><br />The same evening we saw \\"How to tame your dragon\\" on a home theatre, and it made us greatly miss how great it had looked in a theater in 3D, BTW.<br /><br />The measure of a film, for me, is whether it sticks with me. This has. The characters are so richly drawn, and the actors convey their characters with so much good acting and not all the talkiness that screenwriters like to put in everyone's mouths. I'm talkative myself, but most people really aren't, and I felt the screenwriting here was true to the characters' characters.<br /><br />Need anything more to decide whether to see it? Well I should add that it's a dramady that moves deftly between comic and very serous moments. At the end, you won't feel devastated. Actually, you'll have trouble not smiling--the kind ofwarm smile I often give my wife of 30 years after a moment of shared understanding. The film is sophisticated in its characterizations without being at all arch or pretentious. It's an honest movie with a lot of heart, yet without hiding any of the characters' flaws--or, in the case of the more or less bad guys--strengths. Ultimately it has no saints or devils. Just a bunch of people, connected in various way, doing the best they can...in Paradise.<br /><br />EDIT: I realize I failed here to steer people away from \\"The Descendants\\" who wouldn't enjoy it. Like the viewer just above this review who gave it two stars for not being the laugh riot he'd expected--and which, frankly, the studio's marketing led some to expect. I added a long comment to his review, addressing his concerns--and full of spoilers, so be warned before you read it!<br /><br />What I can say here without spoilers is that it's a dramedy. Don't go expecting a light hearted comedic romp! It's got plenty of funny moments, but it's really a pretty serious film. I mean, \\"Hamlet\\" has a funny Gravedigger Scene, you know?<br /><br />You also won't like it if you need everything spelled out for you clearly, as TV mostly does, and Hollywood mostly does. This film is subtle, which to the unsubtle looks like bo-ring.<br /><br />Lastly, you won't like it if you're looking for action. This has no explosions, almost no violence, no car chases, no sex, no horror, no gore, no talky revelations. So you have to pay attention. It's not going to beat you over the head with The Meaning. Life doesn't come with subtitles, and neither does this. It's about family life and a middle aged guy trying to restart his life without making a complete fool of himself (and almost succeeding), set in suburban Hawaii.<br /><br />Hope that helps.in its characterizations without being at all arch or pretentious.

B006JPS1OM|4.0|pretty good app with good story line. I like the puzzles combined with the actions of being a detective.
B004HYXW1O|5.0|I wish there were more stars to select for this album, because 5 just doesn't cut it. My life revolves around music.. I couldn't name all the albums I've purchased throughout my lifetime if i tried, but I can say without hesitating that this is my all time favorite. I discovered The Script in early 2009 and was blown away by their talent, lyrics, and live performances. I didn't think I could like anything more than their debut album, but I was wrong. Science and Faith is beyond amazing. There is not one weak song on the album, and it's impossible to get sick of them. Many times, I will listen to an album on repeat until i eventually get sick of it. I have been listening to Science and Faith on repeat for over a year now, and I am nowhere near tired of it whatsoever. This will forever be a favorite of mine, and I cannot wait to hear more from them in the future.  BUY THIS ALBUM! YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT!

1597801585|2.0|Paolo Bacigalupi was an unfamiliar name to me, but this novel received frothing praise and an unusually good cover, so I gifted it to my dad knowing I'd eventually get a crack at reading it (books are good like that).  This is a debut novel, and a quick glance at Bacigalupi's previous work reveals a volume of short stories that includes titles like Pump Six, Yellow Card Man and The Calorie Man. He has been crafting this world for a while now, the culmination of which is The Windup Girl. It's a cynical but splendidly imagined projection of the near future: fossil fuels are rare and exorbitantly expensive; global warming has raised sea level and weather patterns are volatile; misadventures in bioengineering have ravaged the world with plagues of viruses, bacteria, fungus and insects; corporate interests gain power as regional governments succumb to revolt.  This apocalyptic Thailand is plausible but miserable. You will not gasp at the majesty of steampunk invention here - you will likely gag. Windup's Bangkok is full of feral cats, religious and political fanatics, refugees and opportunistic businessmen. The resident crime boss is named the Dung Lord, and he vies for power along with Trade Minister Akkarat and General Pracha, the victor of a military junta at the narrative's outset. The cast of characters are all hard-bitten, all nursing personal grievances, all hopelessly driven to do what they end up doing. Anderson Lake (a great name for this anti-hero, but they're all good) is an American agribusinessman sent to Thailand with the objective of gaining access to the Kingdom's jealously-guarded seed stock. While pursuing this goal, he becomes entangled with Emiko, the genetically-engineered courtesan of the novel's title.  Fantastical but believable, larger-than-life but eminently identifiable, this setting is the novel's triumph. Methane-filled dirigibles coexist with genetically-engineered oversized elephants, and it clicks. Buddhist monks and Thai monarchy providea traditional backdrop over which drapes Bacigalupi's futurism. I quickly became entranced, wanting to discover the world's machinations, the clockwork of the author's imagination. He's excited about the setting, and he should be - his implications are chilling and his questions difficult. Emiko's predicament is particularly profound as she suffers discrimination due to the stigma of being a 'New Human'. From her DNA up, she has been programmed to serve and please her human masters, and the resultant exploration of her free will feels surprisingly authentic given the shoddy treatment I've come to expect of the subject. Throughout the novel she is told that she has no soul, that she is a piece of 'genetic trash', and I feel real sympathy for her hurt and existential confusion. Anderson Lake plays her intriguing counterpoint as he at once frees and frightens her. His struggle parallels hers at times as he seeks to understand a culture that feels alien and resists his every effort to understand it. I became easily invested in and intrigued with Windup's characters and their unique narrative perspectives. Great, then, was my disappointment as I approached the book's ending with the realization that the material had not been done justice.  This novel should have been better. It's compelling enough that I lament criticizing it too harshly, but it buckles under the weight of scrutiny. I couldn't shake the feeling that I was reading a draft, perhaps a first submission of the novel to a publishing house. Bacigalupi's comfort with short story writing shows, and at its best, the novel is concisely exhilarating. Unfortunately, I quickly found myself tiring of reintroductions of the world's core concepts, as if each chapter starts the story afresh. After suffering 50 or so pages of redundant description, I just wanted the author to get on  with it, thank you very much. Bacigalupi's Thailand is powered by kink-springs (that store and then release the energy taken to wind them up, like toy cars), and he doesn't miss one opportunity to remind the reader - kink-spring scooters, kink-spring fans, kink-spring guns - every single time such an augmented object is mentioned. The narrative suffers from a paucity of descriptive variety as the same phrases become recycled, then rote. The windup girl of the novel's title moves with a \\"stutter-stop\\" motion, which viscerally captures the character the first time it's used, but feels like cruel omniscient taunting by the end of the novel. Characters routinely \\"shrug\\" their way through this or that, or \\"stifle the urge\\" to do something emotive or self-preserving. It's like Bacigalupi has invented a narrative algorithm for the novel, through which he feeds relevant plot points before handing them, unproofed, to the reader.  That would certainly make it easier to explain the shockingly poor editing. I have never read a more shoddily edited book, and that includes the uncorrected advanced reading copies I would receive during my bookstore days. If  technique is the proof of sincerity, Bacigalupi is in danger of being an outright fraud. Some pages contain three or more typos, and I find myself again wondering if I'm reading a draft, summarily scanned by an intern copy editor as it was whisked off to the presses. I can only conclude that  A). his editor(s) is overworked and underpaid  B). the publisher, Nightshade Books, is a peewee operation  C). this book was cobbled together, or the author did not have sufficient time to finish it properly  D). measures of all of the above (most likely)  I wish this work was exceptional, but I have noticed a steep decline in the quality of editing in published works I've read over the last, say, five years. I can only assume that words are getting cheaper and cheaper with the prevalence of internet culture and the continual downsizing of corporate assets such as competent proofreaders. This is a vague and memetic argument, I know, but I can't find another way to explain it.Wherever the blame lies, I think Bacigalupi was shortchanged by his publisher. This book needed more work - more fleshing out, more exploration. The setting needed to breathe and develop subtlety. It's a fast 359 pages, and it felt hamstrung by an ending that comes as suddenly and awkwardly as an early guest. The characters start with promise but struggle to gain dimension, with little development to mark their progress through the narrative. Their motives never change. Anderson Lake starts and ends the novel with the same unshifting focus on acquiring genetic material. The eponymous Windup Girl wants freedom. Corrupt politicians stay corrupt, and fanatics stay fanatical. The novel's few surprises are unsurprising, and all of them feel incidental, like a lone firework on the 3rd of July. For a story that purports to explore the existential concept of the human soul, I find surprisingly little of it in the writing. I am left tempted to call this The Windup Novel. Bacigalupi has something here, something very worthwhile, and I only wish he'd had a stronger team at his publishing house to help him realize his vision.  Read this novel for the setting. Read it for its chilling predictions and clever envisioning. If you're less critical than I am, you'll likely enjoy it.

B001V7UXG2|5.0|Getting the complete Jeeves and Wooster series here was a lucky good buy considering how expensive it normally is ($45-60). I probably just finished watching Jeeves and Wooster for the third time today with my father while I am home for Winter Break from college. It's a great series that's full of witty and sarcastic British humor that while isn't always quite \\"laugh out loud\\" is definitely worth one's while.

B005URRCUY|5.0|The 7th album from this Ohio duo is an absolutely brilliant, immediately grabbing & recognizable,<br />  vibrant & pure rock `n' roll album that runs the gamut from psychedelic Yardbirds guitar riffs and<br />  Zeppelin-esque classic rock to Norman Greenbaum/Spencer Davis/White Stripes garage<br />  marches; from the blues-boogie stomp of John Lee Hooker/Henry's Funeral Shoe to funky,<br />  disco-fried Prince rhythms and the primal soul groove of Booker T. & the MGs/Wilson Pickett/<br />  Steve Cropper.  \\"El Camino\\" is a stunning example of how to successfully marry musical<br />  diversity to a common theme, while retaining a compelling melodic core.  Gritty, throbbing<br />  threads of Stax/ Volt label glory-soul days and old-time gospel handclaps are seamlessly sewn<br />  into raw, blistering garage guitar rock--and both are embraced by a gut-grabbing, hook-filled pop<br />  ethos. There is not one second of filler here.  This is just good time rock `n' roll that's everything it<br />  should be--and a bit more.  Memorable, punchy, infectious songs with a natural, irrefragable<br />  attraction that compels you to both listen and dance.  This is the sound of a band at the top of<br />  their game.  The Black Keys are having fun.  They're locked into a uniquely honest boogie<br />  groove.  It's a place where we can let our hair down and just \\"be\\".  Really, really good!
B00631VJIC|5.0|Fans of the show, eagerly waited for the CD and wasn't dissappointed...  Great songs, Great mix truly caught the spirit of the show.  Bought 2 copies and thinking of purchasing 2 more for family members who didn't recive their copy. Will reccomend this to others... (A plus purchase)

1844256383|5.0|This is something I wish I had when I got my first sax and started playing. In it I found all the key advises about what to do (and importantly also what not to do!) to keep the instrument in perfect order. From the general care, to different levels of maintenance interventions. This manual is clear and user friendly, with useful pictures to guide step by step.  I got mine few weeks ago and I have already managed to do proper lubrication for my tenor, check for leaks, regulate the action and change corks.  Results: much less stress when approaching the instrument and lots of fun while taking care of my sax!

1612130283|5.0|This review will be G-rated even though the book is for mature adults. This book contains heavy content in violence, sex and profanity. I don't recommend to the YA audience.<br /><br />Fifty Shades of Grey is not new to me. I read part of the trilogy back when E.L. James started the story as a fan fiction. I was hooked back then and when I started blogging I lost all the time I had to read fanfic. So when I heard that E.L. actually published the same fanfic I fell in love with into books, I immediately jump on that train. I had been brief that the characters names and places and some minors changes had been done to the story for her to publish. Now that I have read the first book in the trilogy and notice all the changes, I think I fell even harder for the story. It had been a while since I read it as a fanfic so reading now was like reading it for the first time. E.L. does a great job with her story telling of \\"Fifty\\". This book doesn't lack much, yes its heavy in sexual content but you still get a great plot to go along side it. Now on a scale of how hot and heavy it gets, its like a volcanic 10. It will burn you to your core.<br /><br />Fifty Shades of Grey is the story of Anastasia and Christian. Anastasia is your everyday girl next door about to graduated from college. Christian Grey is a young wealthy executive that resembles Adonis. When the two meet by chance well both of their lives are about too change and they don't know it. One day Christian appears at Ana's job after meeting and things begin to ignite. Christian warns Ana to stay away from him but she is captivated by him. Since neither can resist to stay away from each other, Christian must take the next step. Christian approached Ana with his \\"contract\\". What this contract entitles, well its not your everyday yes or no questions. If Ana agrees to the contract her life will completely change. \\"Fifty\\" will come out and Ana will have to decide if she wants Christian with all his demons. This story will stir passion and sympathy when you read it. Will Ana be able to change \\"Fifty\\" back to Christian or will \\"Fifty\\" convert Ana. Between twitchy palms and inner fan-girls dancing around, you will be enraptured with this story.<br /><br />Make sure you have time to sit and read Fifty Shades of Grey because you will not be able to sit the book down. E.L. James has conjured a tale that will leave you blushing and breathless!!! I am now currently reading the next installment in the trilogy: Fifty Shades Darker. So look for that review soon. - Yarampathy when you read it. Will Ana be able to change \\"Fifty\\" back to Christian or will \\"Fifty\\" convert Ana.

B0060CREHO|5.0|This is a real oldie -- in the truest sense of the word!  No 3-D, nothing fancy here, just the tale of an abused group of circus elephants and the oddball offspring of one of their females.  Led by a Drum-Major Mouse, if \\"Dumbo\\" film doesn't bring a tear to your eye (and I'm 68!), nothing will!
B004I8WD6E|5.0|Excellent case! Fits my verizon iPhone 4s very well and the case itself does not stretch out. Covers most of my phone, including all around the front edge. All my buttons are very accessible. Easy to hold and has a good grip without feeling sticky. My white phone looks great through the clear case and shows off the apple logo well. Looks like the screen protector is also good quality. Already had one on my phone but will save this one as a replacement. I have already received several compliments about the case and have only had it for 1 week! I highly recommend this product!

B004XNGKBS|4.0|good app. ive been playing with it for a few hours now.  kindle fire. takes a few min to get use to writing on a smaller surface compared to apiece of paper. sorts notes in modified date or created date. writes as fast as you want.. you can write two or three words and after a time period you select the words will display on the page.<br /><br />one thing I don't like is how the the page fills up and you have to write over the data that is on the page compared to a blank page. using a kindle fire long ways dosent happen much..7in.<br /><br />I will be using this to take notes in meetings and should work fine after I adjusted my page settings.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|This game can be alot of fun, but can also get to be frustrating when you have to constantly retry a level in order to complete it.  Like all of the other Angry Birds games, this one was apparently created for left handed people.  The 'shooter' is on the left hand side of the screen, so a right handed person has to basically cover the screen with their arm in order to shoot (which decreases accuracy).  I would love to see an option to 'flip' the screen over for us right handed people.  The instructions on how to utilize different 'birds' could be alot better. The game seems to have some glitches in the physics engine - it isn't as controllable as later versions on some hardware and often is impossible to precisely control, making finishing some levels the result of pure luck more than skill.  I discovered this on the Kindle Fire and it has also been noted to happen on Galaxy series phones.
B005GVF95O|3.0|So I pretty much download every app of the day from amazon and this one definitely ranks low in terms of fun factor. The puzzles are way too easy to keep one entertained and challenged. At most four minutes per puzzle which is like maybe an hour of overall playtime. Can't complain since it's free, but I wouldn't spend more than a buck for it.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I have just downloaded this app so I haven't played it a whole lot yet. what I have played I love! I love that it.has a variety of.games so that it keeps you entertained. I haven't ran into any problems with this app yet, so no complaints here!
0307891402|5.0|I recieved the Skyrim Guide yesterday and was very excited to start studing it. When I opened the package, I was disappointed to see a few dents in the Hardcover. Since this is a collectors edition, I was expecting it to be free of damage.  Pros: Going through the guide opened up a new perspective on many features. It is a beautiful book, with detailed maps and quest summaries and walkthroughs. It is well written and easy to navigate.  Cons: Damaged Hardcover, If you are looking for Enchanting recipes, I have not found any. This is still a high level book that does not get into a granular level of detail. It would need to be at least a 2 volume set for that.
B002I9Z8G2|5.0|This is by far the best of ST:TNG movie series...if not the whole ST movie series even...with the right amount of action, sci-fi and comedy for both Trekkies and non-Trekkies to enjoy.   PQ is quite good when comparing with other Star Trek: First Contact editions out there (VHS, DVD) though sadly it can't match with the PQ of current movies shot in 2D (obviously!!!)   The extras are abundant with some in HD even. The disc has all sufficient background information on the movie and related reference to the movie in the ST:TNG TV series, i.e. when Picard was abducted by the Borg, the design evolution of Borg costumes, etc.   Highly recommended for both Trekkies and non-Trekkies
B000U1ZV8K|4.0|Great movies and picture quality. I just wish they didn't use double sided DVDs. A mere 10 cents more would've made individual DVDs and it would've been greatly appreciated.
B004SIPA4G|5.0|Be warned, this movie is not for all to enjoy (hence the R rating), after all with the movie title being Sin City and based on adult themed comic, what else would you expect? It's filled with violent, black comedy and adult theme...but that is what Frank Miller, Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino's work are famous for and the reason (some) people love it...me one of 'em!  The PQ is great, the way the monochrome contrasts the purposely expressed colours of reds and yellows and blue is just truly dazzling and eye popping! I luv it!!! Worth my every cent buying it in BD!!!!!   The extras are abundant, ranging from the recut version of the film to background information on how it evolves from comic book to movie ranging from wardrobe design to cars...but sadly only some of the extras are in HD...  Highly recommended for those that wants to treat their eyes! I know mine enjoyed it!!!
0307593312|1.0|Maybe you are reading this because you have loved Murakami novels, like I have. His voice as an author has meant something in your life. Or you like the cover, which is very nice, Chip Kidd.  But I am writing this review to share with you, how terribly disappointed I am in this novel.  There is no one I can tell but you, amazon readers.  I spent a signifigant portion of my holiday holed up with this book, which is almost 1000 pages.   I like long books.  This is too long. Haruki is terribly repetitive, flashing back to the same scenes over and over, expecting that because he tells us they were emotionally meaningful, they will be to the reader.   They are not.  It seems trite.   Obviously, since I read the whole book, I didn't hate it the whole time. The beginning was interesting, the middle was even suspenseful at times. And, as always, Murakami creates another world, a rabbit hole to fall down.  For me, it was the ending which really left me deflated.  It is a kind of happy ending, but it feels undeserved. The ending is 3 pages long, a very simple way to end a story, and somehow not in keeping with the rest of the novel. It makes me believe there must be an alternate ending. Can he really finish this work with such a stupid ending? Who can be satisfied with this?   Thats it, Mr. Murakami?  What a waste of time!  I trusted you!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|okay. some games don't work as well as others. some don't work.at all, but it is fun.to.pass the time. it.is.al.in.all.a.God.app.to.
B002ZG98G4|4.0|I have bought quite a few blu-rays on Amazon and have been content with all of them to include this one, Morning Glory.

Very happy with the deals on blu-ray discs I have bought here on Amazon.  Thanks!
0553801473|2.0|Beware, slight spoilers and slightly more ranting to follow.<br /><br />While absence may have made the hearts of some readers grow fonder, it certainly hasn't for me. A Dance with Dragons suffers from many of the same things as its predecessor, A Feast for Crows. For one, the length. Don't get me wrong. I'm not a lazy reader by any means. A thousand pages is not a daunting thing for me to read, especially if I enjoy the story. But there are just too many words! Martin really needs to learn to get to the point.<br /><br />For example, I could care less about the extensive feast descriptions that pop up, it seems, once per chapter. See, Mr. Martin, I can do it too:<br /><br />\\"The table was covered end to end with dishes overflowing: lamprey pies slowly congealing in the tepid air, tender roast mutton whose meat looked like to drip off the bone, tail of dog soup, caramelized cranberry steak tartar, blood pudding served with steaming buttered loaves of sour dough bread, Dornish wine glittering in crystal decanters, broiled pig stuffed with dates and walnuts, food, more food, some more of that food we were talking about, did I already mention food? Well here's some more, let me describe it to you in exhaustive detail if you don't believe me...\\"<br /><br />And five years later we get back to the story, but I've already forgotten what we were talking about. And now I'm hungry. Awesome. I felt like I was reading a medieval Martha Stewart cookbook. I'm sure some would call this overabundance of description \\"details,\\" but I think it is unnecessary and something that hinders the progression of the plot. If you say that they're having a feast or dinner or whatever, Mr. Martin, I believe you. I promise! Now please use that page space for furthering the plot instead.<br /><br />I don't have all negative things to say about ADwD. I do love the POV characters. Well, okay. Most of them, the ones that actually add to the story. But those one-off, fringe characters that easily could have been shafted from the final draft? Those characters get on my nerves. Why waste a chapter on The Iron Suitor when I could read more of Arya, or Jaime? The POV characters who got significant face time in this book were, thankfully, very interesting, although Tyrion is starting to wear out his welcome. I've always been fond of Bran as a character, so I really looked forward to reading his share of the chapters. I liked that Theon had his chance to shine, and I do love reading about the Wall and the North through Jon's POV.<br /><br />Here's my main problem with the series however. No amount of clever wording, surprisingly exciting (but few and far between) chapter installments, or intriguing character development can mask the fact that not a lot has happened over the course of these five books. I feel like I'm watching one of those television shows where each week they have some exciting, self-contained little adventure that adds absolutely nothing to the overarching plot.<br /><br />Argue with me all you want to the contrary, I'm sticking with that assessment. I've been so blinded by the idea of this being an epic fantasy book series that I've ignored the fact that there has been very little follow-through in that regard. This series has been overhyped. There, I said it. It's still a tremendous body of work, sure, but if Mr. Martin churns out hundreds of pages per installment and can only move the plot along at a snaillike pace, maybe I'm not getting enough bang for my buck, and that disappoints me. I want this story to be worthwhile.<br /><br />And I want to see how this all ends. I do. But it's going to be a wearisome struggle to get there.

B006IVBSBU|4.0|The movie opens in an airport lounge where an obviously ill Beth Emhoff, played by Gwyneth Paltrow, is on the phone with her husband Mitch, played by Matt Damon.  Somewhere in the world the wrong pig met the wrong bat and a new, highly contagious strain of deadly virus was born.  Unknowingly, Beth is its first victim, infected while on a business trip.  Within hours of her arrival home in Minneapolis, people who came into contact with her are either dead or dying and thousands of others around the world have become infected.  Samples have been collected and sent to the Centers for Disease Control and the World Health Organization whose job it is to figure out what in the world is happening.    The world is unprepared for this lethal virus.  By day 18, the severity of the outbreak is clear and the social structure starts to deteriorate.  Cities are quarantined, curfews imposed, the dead are buried in mass graves, food is in short supply, and riots erupt.  With no vaccine and no protection and a 25% mortality rate, the scenario is definitely worst case.  Laurence Fishburne plays Dr. Ellis Cheever, the presiding CDC official everyone turns to for reassurance and answers.    We've seen similar scenarios many times on film but not quite in this way.  In \\"Contagion,\\" the science takes center stage.  The science is spot on, it's as real as it gets, and the scientists and researchers are portrayed as the heroes they really are.  The movie accurately portrays how they do their jobs, how passionate they are, how they personally react to a scary situation and how extraordinarily tough and dangerous the work is.  The pressure is intense.  The truth is scary.  From all the experts, it's all a matter of when, not if.    How do the people involved in disease investigations mitigate the damage as quickly as possible?  How do they communicate the threat without causing fear and panic?  How much information is the public entitled to know?  How do they handle misconceptions and disinformation which can spread like a disease on the web? As Dr. Sanjay Gupta puts it in the bonus section, \\"information itself is a transmissible disease.  It can cause a lot of damage.  It spreads very, very quickly and in some cases people can die from it.\\"  I was both entertained and informed.  To be forewarned is to be forearmed.  What more can I ask for from a movie?  It's definitely worth a look.
B003XF1XOQ|1.0|She clearly did not know how to write this book. I'm ust writing this review to add to the 1 star reviews. I was terrible disappointed, and have resorted to reading fan fictions to find a more suitable, alternate conclusion.

Am a big fan of his work and this book helped me get a better understanding of the genius who made all these well-designed gadgets I am using possible.<br /><br />Thinking of also buying the actual book as this will definitely end up as a classic.
B005H29GSI|1.0|This is a great concept but the reality is that it is far too difficult to play without major frustration, which sucks every ounce of fun out of it.  My children have a lot of difficulty with the building, and we have as much if not more diffculty knocking it down.  We have changed the rules and still find it near impossible to enjoy the game.  I end up doing all the building, and even after doubling the number of times you can 'shoot' the birds at it we are largely unsuccessful at getting all the pigs knocked over.  We also tried playing it with my neighbor and his two kids and after 30 minutes they felt exactly the same way about it.  It looks like it's going to be a simple and fun game, but it's absolutely the opposite.  My kids have zero interest in playing it now, because of the lack of success we have, so it's going to end up just sitting on a shelf - and we've only had it for 10 days!  THIS REVIEW ALSO APPLIES TO THE \\"KNOCK ON WOOD\\" VERSION
B002CIY8EM|3.0|Bought this after watching Ancient Aliens. The general idea is very interesting and it encouraged me to look at things from a different perspective. The examples in the book are a little outdated though and may need to be updated. The examples from the TV series are more updated and are more interesting.<br /><br />Might want to read his other newer books but this is a good introduction to his hypothesis.
B004U52VPS|1.0|This is a great concept but the reality is that it is far too difficult to play without major frustration, which sucks every ounce of fun out of it.  My children have a lot of difficulty with the building, and we have as much if not more diffculty knocking it down.  We have changed the rules and still find it near impossible to enjoy the game.  I end up doing all the building, and even after doubling the number of times you can 'shoot' the birds at it we are largely unsuccessful at getting all the pigs knocked over.  We also tried playing it with my neighbor and his two kids and after 30 minutes they felt exactly the same way about it.  It looks like it's going to be a simple and fun game, but it's absolutely the opposite.  My kids have zero interest in playing it now, because of the lack of success we have, so it's going to end up just sitting on a shelf - and we've only had it for 10 days!  THIS REVIEW ALSO APPLIES TO THE \\"ON THIN ICE\\" VERSION
B004X8W42M|3.0|The book came with a horizontal cut through the jacket and half way through the top cover. I expect when I pay for something that it come in decent condition.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is a lot of fun!  I like how you have to get points to get to the next game and since there's so many, I probably won't ever get bored!!!
B0063IH60K|5.0|No glitches I've seen. It's a lovely time waster! It doesn't need to be too complicated. Also, minimum word requirements are dumb
B0054JZC6E|4.0|you can play games that are fun, yet free. lots of the games u wud have to pay 4 but not with this app
0446573019|5.0|I really like Zero Day and am looking forward to the next in the series. Puller has it all. If you like Reacher you can like Puller too - just like you can like Greaney's Gray man, Battles' Quinn and Eisler's Rain. Zero Day is another Baldacci winner.

B002SF9YNO|5.0|Departures portrays an unusual topic, one that I wouldn't have sought out, yet the movie was recommended by Netflix, so I gave it a try.  A young Japanese couple struggles to make ends meet and he applies for a job that sounds like it might be for a travel agency.  It is, however, preparing bodies after death.  I do not have the words to describe the depth of emotion, the tenderness, respect and understanding of the human condition that this movie conveys.  It is superb.  I've seen very few movies more than once, and this is one that I bought.
0439023521|5.0|This is certainly a page turner, and I found myself struggling to put it down. Recommended to me by my daughter, I was hesitant to read it because of the dark nature of the story but I'm certainly glad that I did!  I enjoy stories that highlight a powerful independent female protagonist and this book certainly delivers.  Fast paced story that will keep you frozen in place until you complete it!    For those who enjoyed Hunger Games as much as I did, I also recommend [[ASIN:B006EO5DXA Burn in Hades (The Life After Death Trilogy, Book 1)]], another captivating read on my Top 10 books of this year.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|best free app ever on android, gives angry bird a big competitor! i really love this game, 5 stars! cool
B005HSG3VK|5.0|This is exactly what I was looking for, its slim fitting, protects the entire kindle and looks nice.  It does a good (good not great) job at propping up the kindle as well.  I am very happy.
B004HO6I4M|5.0|Excellent Service! Reveived promptly and in tim for xmas. The product arrived here in Australia in very good condition and was enjoyed by all. You could point out that the product is suitable for Zone 1 though; fortunatuly I hav a multy function DVD machine.  But Thank You for the quick service.
B005GVF95O|3.0|This as I'm sure you've noticed was offered as a free app by Amazon. I'm reviewing this for anyone who comes along later and must pay for it.<br /><br />I used this app on my Acer Iconia Tablet. Performance wise it has worked quite well without anything preventing it from being used which can happen on tablets since phones are the main market.<br /><br />My two year old daughter enjoys playing it and has fun so I will give it 3 stars for that.<br /><br />I do not give it five stars for two reasons.<br /><br />First this is just a gateway app for the developers to steer you towards their other products, with only a very small selection of puzzles and no customization features (piece size, difficulty, etc).<br /><br />Second there is no difficulty at all to the puzzles. You just have to drag the peice into the general area of where it goes and it will automatically snap into position. Makes it useful for extreamly young children who can't understand puzzles at all, but my daughter at 2 is way beyond this and as such gets nothing educational out of this app. Just entertainment. That's fine if that's what you are looking for but they market it as educational and it really isn't. There are other puzzle apps out there that require more critical thinking to finish and thus provide more value while having 'fun'.<br /><br />Hope this was helpful.
B004JQN364|5.0|Bought all of these as a set: [[ASIN:B004JQKXF8 Gorilla Mutant]], [[ASIN:B001PIJEBM Tiger Man]], [[ASIN:B004JQN364 Mutant Dragon]], [[ASIN:B0014GVMGK Rhino Man]], [[ASIN:B0014GTZ0U Papo Lion Man]], [[ASIN:B0036MDNW6 Papo Ram Man]], [[ASIN:B001PIJEBW Crocodile Man]]  I have to say Papo makes exceptional toys. The detail on these are amazing. The weapons are removable, which could provide a hazard to really young kids. These make a great collection for older *kids* like me as well. Definitely works of art.
B004H1V5RU|5.0|[[ASIN:B004H1V5RU Perplexus Epic]]  This was a Christmas gift for my 11 year old granddaughter.  She didn't have much of a chance to use it Christmas Eve, as the adults all wanted a turn with it.  The challenge constantly changes with each completion of the maze.  Last year, the Find-It puzzle was the hit of the day, and this year we've added the Perplexus Epic.  The ordering process was easy, the puzzle lived up to the description, and once again I'm pleased with doing business through Amazon.  Thank you !
B003NHRGSQ|3.0|The plot was really dragging and the entire plot seemed to be crammed into the last twenty pages. The rest was character moping or predictable, everyday character routines. I guess she planned and wrote this one too quickly to make it as good as some of her others. I gave-up on the series after this.
B006RUJST6|5.0|I'm an avid reader.  Not a moment goes by that I don't have a book or two that I'm reading.  This is not usually the genre that I read but I couldn't beat the price...FREE!  I don't think I've ever read a book as emotionally driven as this one.  I laughed, I cried, I got mad, I laughed some more, and then cried even more than I did the first time.  I started to wonder, like Lake, if I could cry too much.  Colleen, you are one talented lady!  Keep writing books and you may just turn me into a fan of The Avett Brothers.  =)
0545123275|4.0|Somewhat teenish, and it might not appeal to general fantasy fans. I still thought it was a lot better than many fantasies though! There are not many good books about werewolves out there, but this is well worth it if you do not mind romantic immersion.
B00319ECGK|5.0|I am very pleased with this purchase. One of the greatest films to ever hit the big screen. Thank you for your business.
B005GVF95O|3.0|The graphics look pretty poor on my screen(jagged) and the menu is lame (have the menu icons respond when you click on them).  So -2 stars. I guarantee that the kids will enjoy.  (Samsung galaxy s II) Ps, if you ever write a review, include your phone model!!
143911000X|4.0|The book has exact quotes that are aired at the end of each show(How I Met Your Mother). It is a fun read. Very pleased with it.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Fun, fast paced,and very easy to become addicted to this app. Doesn't require Lot's of concentration so great to play while waiting for appointments.
0316098329|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. I was so endeared by Jack, I completely fell in love with him. I thought the characters were well developed and I could really see into their little world in Room. I could not put this book down. I was torn between racing through to find out what happened and wanting to go slow to savor my enjoyment. I thought the style of writing was unique, and I was rooting for the characters all the way. Only down-side may have been the anti-climatic ending, but the rest of the book still had me enamored enough to overlook this. I immediately recommended this book to friends on Facebook and passed it on to my Mom and Sister to read -- with the understanding that they read it fast and give it back asap so I can read it again! Reading a book twice is very rare for me, in fact I don't recall ever doing it. Thumbs up!
B005VA8AJW|5.0|This is an excellent mini-series from FX.  You definitely need to watch all of them as no one episode stands out on its own.
B0052VUNHC|4.0|75% of this book was good but toward the end just too stupidly disfunctional.  The hero became more and more unlikable until I just wanted it to end.  Could have been better with more back story/ flashbacks; more America, and more Vegas.  Less of the hero punching and threatening EVERYONE coming within an inch of the heroine.  In my minds eye, the hero became shorter, less attractive, and more goon-like toward the end.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|my couisin suggested this app for me and I absolutely LOVE IT! there are so many fun games on here. some games may be hard at first but when you play it 5 times it gets easy. plus when you play a game 5 times it gives you a 1000 point bonus. this app is also free. you should get it for sure. :D
B004UNX1LS|4.0|it works great on my kindle fire. the app it self looks really nice and very easy to navigate. I gave it 4 stars and not 5 because I have come across a few videos that said video not available. other then that great alternative to youtube for watching music videos. high quality video. good sound.
B005FNVDSA|4.0|I take this opportunity for some remarks on a really basic issue - namely that reviewing \\"live\\" performances on record, and comparing them to studio productions, is radical nonsense.  Studio recordings are made as consumer products and intended for repeated listening as documents of a composer's art and the skills and insights of his performers under stringently controlled and near-private conditions.  Live recordings are memorabilia of unique public occasions, and as such do not fall into the category of general consumer articles. Do they nevertheless serve the general public? No, because they cannot reproduce anything of the concert as an event - none of the aura, ambience, frisson, excitement (or boredom) of the audience, only the cold sound. Such a recording is essentially similar to a black and white photocopy of the Mona Lisa.  As it happens, I was present at the occasion of this recording; and it was profoundly affecting as great live performances by such great artists can be. Naturally I bought the album as a memento. But I cannot for a moment pretend that the sounds coming off the disk resemble much of what I experienced that evening. And if it is almost meaningless to me now, except as a reminder of what I witnessed, how much more senseless to you! If you did not know it was Pollini playing in Dresden, but had to judge this blindfold, you could not discern the inspiration it conveyed to the audience.  Nothing much else to add. From this point you're on your own. But there are two studio recordings from Pollini which both serve your need for fine readings of this concerto.  (The 4 stars are no value judgement, just a helpless indicator that the product is neither good nor bad, but just not a product!).
0312641893|4.0|Even in the future discrimination can still be found, but so can robots, and colonies on the moon...and war.  In New Beijing Cinder, a cyborg, is considered a second class citizen all because she has a few robotic parts in her even though she's still mostly human.  She can love, she can bleed, and she can hope for a better future away from her evil stepmother.  But for now...Cinder must work in her mechanic shop and support her stepmother and two stepsisters, all while dealing with the hate she receives from other shop keepers.  But then...Prince Kaito, heir to the imperial throne of the Eastern Commonwealth, comes to her shop to get help with fixing a broken android.  Her shop!  And her life changes.  She's swept up in a political battle between the Earth and the Lunars, the colony on the moon, who are just waiting to attack the planet.  And along the way she must avoid being used for research purposes to find a cure for an incurable plague that is devastating the Earth.<br /><br />This is a compelling reimagining of Cinderella, set in a dystopian future where the world has experienced a 4th world war, there are robots and cyborgs, a colony on the moon, and are now suffering a plague.  Those components right there drew me in because it sounded a bit like Issac Asimov's world (which I love), but what kept me interested in the book was the fact that Cinder is such a compelling character.  She's a strong female character who isn't afraid to get dirty, not afraid to put herself in danger, she can love, and she's selfless--even willing to help those that hate and despise what she is.  And their are other compelling characters, such as the stepsister that truly does care for Cinder.  And even the evil stepmother isn't so evil and has some good in her.<br /><br />The story isn't without faults though.  My biggest issue is that there is just so much going on in the story that at times it felt overwhelming: Cyborgs who are considered second class citizens, the plague, robots and AI's, and of course the Lunar colony that wants to destroy the planet.  It just felt like a lot to introduce in one book and I just never felt like each of these issues got the explanation/justice that it deserved and I just wanted to be able to focus on some of those aspects a bit more.  Perhaps we'll resolve some of these issues in the other books, but I hope there isn't as much being thrown at us in one book.<br /><br />The one other minor quibble I have, as others have already noted, I figured out the plot twist within the first 40 pages.  It didn't detract from the overall book, but it's the first time in a long time that I've a significant plot twist was revealed so early on and it felt a bit like we were clubbed over the head with it.  I just wanted it to be a bit more of a surprise than it was.<br /><br />It's still a good read and I'd recommend it to just because I really do enjoy the unique aspect of cyborg/prince charming/Lunar people in it.  And I look forward to seeing what the next volume reveals.<br /><br />ARC provided by NetGalleyourse the Lunar colony that wants to destroy the planet.

0439023513|5.0|I love the Hunger Games series - truly.  I believe it sets the standard for all other books in this genre.  But I had to read Mockingjay TWICE before I would give it 5 stars.   Before I delve into why you should read it at least twice, let me give a brief review of the book as a whole.  This is *not* like the other two books in the Hunger Games series.  Peeta has been taken captive by the Capitol and tortured to the point he loathes Katniss and wants to kill her.  Katniss is quite honestly in shock over the events she's gone through during the past year.  Her whole world has been literally turned upside down, her home district demolished, and now there's a full out rebellion going on. She hides and sleeps, relies on medication to get her through some periods, refuses to go to training/classes.  We do see glimpses of the old Katniss on occasion - the fire that makes up her character shines through when the Capitol bombs the Rebel hospital in District 8, and she fights back.  It pushes her forward into action when she would rather curl up in a ball and die.  Finnick is a shell of his former self, barely hanging onto reality most of the time.    Anyone who has ever suffered a severe loss or depression realizes how traumatic those times in your life were.  I could not begin to fathom being forced into an arena not once, but twice, and fighting to the death.  If you're expecting rainbows and roses at this stage of the book, it is completely unrealistic.  It would be IMPOSSIBLE for the main characters to carry on with life as usual after what they have endured at the Capitol's hands, and I would have been disappointed in the storyline as a whole if Ms. Collins had chosen to portray the characters that way.  That's not the way people work - we're not machines.  The first time I read the book, I literally had to put it down when Prim was killed, and that may be a first ever for me.  I couldn't believe Katniss would have to live without Prim after all she'd done to try to keep her alive.  But - I cheered (quite loudly) when Katniss shot Coin instead of Snow after realizing nothing had changed with those in power except the faces.  The Rebels forcing the Capitol's children into one \\"final\\" Hunger Games would've been just as bad as what the Capital was doing.  The corruption knew no end.  Initially, I thought the final few pages were the absolute worst the first time I read it.  I so very much wanted Katniss and Gale to wind up together, and after just losing Prim, I was extremely disappointed in the book.  I would've given it 3 stars.  Seriously.  I waited a few months, read it again, and realized I was so engrossed in the story the first go around, I missed a lot of details.  I knew the outcome this time, so that allowed me to look at the book from a totally different perspective.  While Prim's death is still disappointing, I now realize that Katniss and Peeta winding up together is the ONLY possible outcome that makes any sense for this story.  Only Peeta truly understood what Katniss had been through in the arenas, and could relate to what she saw in her nightmares when she closed her eyes.  While Gale made for an interesting love triangle at times, Peeta was the one who loved her completely and unconditionally - warts and all.    Parental concerns - I would not recommend children under 8th grade read it due to the violence, but I have said that about all of the books in this series.  No cursing or sexual content, but there are a few kisses.  This is a gritty story, horrible to even consider happening, and I personally feel that a parent will need to discuss some of the issues with their child.  It is certainly ripe with opportunities to do so.  What is the Hunger Games really about?  Control.  Domination and oppression of the people by a self-centered government bent on preserving their own way of life no matter the cost to others, no matter how violent and cruel they have to be to obtain it.  The story is so much bigger than just asimple girl with a bow and arrows.    Read it once.  Put it down for a few months.  Read it again with a new perspective.  This series as a whole is Suzanne Collins' finest work.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Great choices in Bible versions to read.  Also love the reading plans and study books provided! I am so glad I have this on my Fire.
0312641893|5.0|Huge thanks to Harper Collins and NetGalley for giving me this book free in exchange for my honest review!<br />(Originally posted at That Artsy Reader Girl)<br /><br />I'm jumping on the \\"Cinder-lovers\\" bandwagon and seriously have no idea how to approach this review. Haha! My thoughts feel so unorganized and are conflicting with one another. What can I say that will make my review different? So many people have already covered everything. Oh well! Here goes!<br /><br />I've loved Cinderella for my entire life, and I was pretty excited to hear about a new retelling. I thought that cyborgs and androids were pushing the envelope a little too far, though. I was SO wrong! I loved how Cinder tied in all the elements of the original story, but put a modern sci-fi spin on it! And even though we're talking about a dystopian society with cyborgs and aliens, Cinder was still a completely magical fairy tale. :)<br /><br />I loved Marissa Meyer's writing style, and very creative imagination! The world she created left me with no questions. The detailed descriptions of the scenery, futuristic mechanics and medicine, people, etc. were captivating to read. I got totally lost. I loved Cinder's character. She's a tom-boy mechanic, and has grease stains all over her ALL the time. Her idea of getting dressed up is putting on a shiny new foot, not a glass slipper. She's spunky, and realistic. She sticks up for herself when it counts, and is not afraid of anything! I pretty much adore the fact that she's always got her head on straight. Perhaps her internal programming is what keeps her grounded, but she just gets it. She knows what needs to be done, no matter what, and she does it! She lets nothing cloud her judgement. You go, girl! Her quirky android friend/assistant, Iko, is hilarious. She's a machine, but there's some kind of glitch in her that makes her more human than most androids. I was enthralled by their story, and really loved reading about their latest projects and schemes.<br /><br />Prince/Emperor Kai is a little... eh right now. Don't get me wrong, I like him. It's just that as the male lead in the story, we don't know much about him. His conversations with Cinder are mostly small talk, with a few intimate details shared every once in a while. Perhaps he'll become more rounded in the next three books. I do appreciate that there's no insta-love. They both know that there's a connection, but they're not going crazy about it. Meyer is giving them time to develop their relationship, which we will hopefully be able to see in the next books.<br /><br />My favorite parts were the hidden Cinderella details, and the awesome futuristic settings and technology. Oh, and the ending is pretty breathtaking as well. Twists and turns keep you guessing until the last sentence. I would have enjoyed seeing a little more character development in Kai. Right now, I'm not seeing what Cinder sees in him. Also, the story takes place in New Beijing, but I never would have known if it had not been continually mentioned. I would have liked more Chinese cultural elements, even futuristic ones. Finally, the ending was a bit too rushed for me, and then I fell off a cliff all of a sudden. I'm hanging by a thread here, wondering how the ending snuck up on me so fast! I wish Meyer had taken a little more time drawing things to a close.<br /><br />Regardless of my tidbits of constructive criticism, I can't deny how much I loved the story. Sometimes we have to make allowances and just enjoy the ride, forgetting what we would have preferred. Plus, I'm trying to remember that there's 3 more books in the series! Marissa has plenty of time to turn Emperor Kai into Prince Charming. She has plenty of time to explain more details to me. I kind of like the mystery I've been left with. If we were given too much with this book, the others would end up being fluff. I'm sad I have to wait so long for Scarlet (Book #2). I guess that's the downside of getting ARCs: more time to wait for the next one! Haha!
030788743X|4.0|i plowed through this book at work during the holidays (very slow time of year for my job)  i thought the first half of the book was fantastic, i definitely enjoyed some of the nostalgia (altho i think there could have been more or better references.......too much late 70s, early 80s where most of my memories were late 80s)  the story was pretty interesting (if you played mmos ever its a lot easier to understand the story compared to a non-gaming person)  *possible spoilers but nothing specific*  the main problem i had was the climax/ending chapters.  I felt like the author rushed to meet a deadline or something.  You have this long buildup to what you hope is going to be this epic battle in the end and it literally lasts just a couple pages.  I felt their could have been so much more done with this portion of the book, especially the real ending 'fight' so to speak.
1904994679|3.0|I bought this book for my 8 year old son for Christmas.  We like to look at all the amazing records set in this book.  It is not as interesting as I remember it when I used to read it growing up in the 80's but overall a good book.
B005KLN074|5.0|Order this from amazon.co.uk (British Amazon site). Features the full show plus bonus interviews. Is region free and NTSC so will play on regular US players. Great gig in small intimate theatre. Very cool.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|The scope of this series is nothing short of epic and it all started with Game of Thrones.<br /><br />If you're an avid reader and haven't read Game of Thrones I'd highly recommend it.  I don't know why it took me so long to start reading the series but I'm VERY glad I did.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great game I have been playing it for almost an hour and have enjoyed every minute.  :) I would reccomend this to anyone looking for a fun game.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Every once in a while you'll find a book that you enjoy so much you wish you could go somewhere deserted just so you can read.  A book so good that you long for the train ride home from work just so you can read some more.  The Hunger Games series is just that good.  It grasped my attention and didn't let me go until the last line on the last page.  By the end I was actually sad to see the series end.  A wonderful experience that had a satisfying ending.  I HIGHLY recommend.
0446573019|3.0|I read David Baldacci's novels because I find them amusing and entertaining. I'm often most amused by poorly written dialogue or characters that are stereotypes or poorly developed. In his latest novel, Zero Day, Baldacci seems to start from scratch. He introduces a new heroic protagonist, John Puller, and I found myself recognizing the individual and rooting for his success. The fast pace of the plot and the thrilling action kept me turning pages quickly, and I found the dialogue was not as distracting as it had been in earlier Baldacci novels. Readers who like character-driven action thrillers are those most likely to enjoy this novel.<br /><br />Rating: Three-star (Recommended)
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I highly recommend you get this app I play it on car rides good time killer love most of the games on here
B006JPS1OM|5.0|the only thing not great was the times I had to click to get the object. graphics are great though.

B0054JZC6E|5.0|absolutely great....  it is totally worth the money I highly suggest it ti anyone who needs to kill some time.... I enjoy that it has games that you have to unlock....
0684801558|4.0|Recently sauntering into a Fitzgerald phase, after rereading (or should I admit, like a former lackadaisical high schooler, reading for the first time) the Great Gatsby, I selected a second Fitzgerald for comparison and contrast.  The similarities are obvious, a cast of characters ensconced by the status of wealth in the early 20th century.  I believe Beautiful and Damned arrived previous to Gatsby, and whereas it has less popularity I would hesitate to suggest that it lacks worthiness.  It is heavy in melancholy.  It is generous in melodrama, more than Gatsby.  An excellent read, a depressing read, it is a Henry Jamsian entreaty on the emptiness of the (dare I type it) American Dream, when coupled with haughty aspiration, and betrothed to hedonistic materialism.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|These games are really fun they are hard, but they are really fun.I love these fun games.They rock.Everybody should like them.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Love it. Use it every day for a could of devotionals. Use it in church. It is very easy and quick to get to a specific passage. Great notes and bookmarking ability also. I like the new improvements. Keep up the god work.
B006MHWXMS|5.0|As a rabid GTDer, I've been looking for a simple list manager to manage my Next Actions that I could also sync to the cloud.  Not only does this app for the bill, but it's one of the most professionally designed Toronto apps I've seen.  It's just beautiful.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I consider myself in pretty good shape. I am a high school Physical Education teacher and work out typically 5-6 days/week.  I like Crossfit, running, yoga and Pilates...so decided to give Jillian a try. All four workouts kicked my rear and I loved it! I love the 3-2-1 concept as well as getting great results without spending two hours at a gym. I've incorporated many of her exercises into the workouts I've created for both my Aerobic and Personal Fitness classes. Every muscle burns and then burns some more at some point in these workouts. But like Jillian says, \\"You can do anything for twenty minutes!\\"
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app has great reading plans, for the whole Bible or just an overview . It even has some good voice overs to keep you going when reading the tough names in the Old Testament.
0553062182|4.0|It's not what I thought it would be, but I still enjoy reading it. It's a book, afterall. I love reading, but don't find time to do such a task often. I thought I was HSP as she likes to call it, but i'm not 100% sure now. I may be a mix between different things. I do like the little quizzes at the end of each \\"chapter\\" to see what results you get and what it tells about you.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|As a pastor, quick, reliable access to Scripture is obviously pretty important to me. YV goes far beyond that whether I'm preaching, teaching, doings visits or just enjoy the Word for myself.
B003PIUC02|5.0|I bought this for my sister in 2010 because she is obsessed with this show. It was on sale and fairly cheap for a Blu-Ray disc. Actually, it's the same price as it is now ($35). Be sure to read about what the show is about. If you love gladiator fighting with lots of blood and intense sex scenes then this is for you! I bought it new and it came new. Perfect.
B005GVF95O|4.0|I just downloaded this on my FIRE and tried out. Other than wishing it made noise of some sort it looks like my 2 1/2 year old will like it. I really like that she is not going to have to get the pieces in the perfect position to get then in the right spot. Looks like it'll be another good one to pull out when waiting in line or some other time and place were a quiet activity is needed. Thanks!
B000R7I3LY|5.0|I've wanted this CD for a while and finally made the leap to buy it. It's weird because on both albums, I love 2 and 3. Vegas and Bottle It Up are my favorite. Next step is to see her live at a concert. I wish I had gone to it this year.
B004UUKDNA|1.0|... Does anyone who really likes (and appreciate) Pop & Rock music, consider that this album has any tune that can be called \\"A Good Song\\"...???<br /><br />C'mon...  Please Amazon.com, include the 'Zero Stars' rating option ASAP!!!
B002ZG9760|5.0|I enjoyed this movie. But, my sister bought it on my account. Oops. A tale of \\"It's what is on the inside that matters most.\\" We live in a world that is visual and unfortunately, the outside appearance of people matter to pretty much everyone. He didn't look horrific to me... I'm definitely glad he wasn't as superficial in the end as in the beginning of the movie.

0761119752|5.0|Purchased this book for baby's Christmas gift, but it has really been a gift for me!  The fun story of putting on pajamas and doing the \\"pajama-dee-bop\\" has made our bedtime ritual active and entertaining!  The end of the book encourages children to continue the party in their dreams and also gives \\"hush,hush\\" for quieting down for rest.  Love it!!!
B000O8OTNC|4.0|It works well for the price i got it because it can fit into a pocket or small pouch but its nice because it dose a lot more then just sharpen knifes even though that's all iv used it for but so far i am enjoying it :)love all the things i have the choice to sharpen with it.

1600597963|5.0|I am a beginning bead embroiderer and have purchased several books on the subject.  All have inspirational photos of incredible jewelry and bead work, however, I found this book particularly helpful with the instructional aspect. I especially liked that each artist shared their preferred stitches along with clear instructions as to how to do them. I am in awe of both artists and their work and can only hope to somewhat emulate their beautiful work.  I highly recommend this book as a beginner, but feel that there is something in it for everyone.
B005Q1W10A|1.0|The story was interesting and engaging, but I stopped watching when they portrayed a man kissing another man romantically.  Not my cup of tea.  If you like that sort of thing, this will likely be a good choice for you.  If you don't like that sort of thing, be prepared for a surprise \\"yuck\\" factor.  NOTE: This was accidentally posted on the Season 2 review.  I have reposted this under Season 1 where it belongs.  I am leaving the accidental Season 2 review in place because of all the dialogue it generated.
0060899190|1.0|The book is exactly what you see on the website every Sunday. I bought it because I was incredibly into the site for some time but now I feel like it was kind of a waste of $25. The secrets are touching and moving but reading the same set over and over just isn't appealing.. You might as well just donate the money to Frank directly.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I really like  playing this game. It is fun and you don't have to stress about anything. Just enjoy the simplicity of it.
B006IVBSBU|4.0|CONTAGION is an important film for the general public to see. It addresses the etiology of contagious diseases, how they begin, how they are introduced in to the world population, how they can be viewed as instances of germ warfare, how they are examined by both the US Centers for Disease Control and the World Health Organization, how they are disseminated, the processes required for creating a vaccine, how the treatments are managed, how individuals are affected both directly and indirectly, who decides the priorities of treating large number of people around the globe, and how in the face of a world crisis certain evil people can take advantage of the fear and make millions off unsuspecting terrified people. Yes, this information is in articles readily available for public consumption, but nothing surpasses a well-written film for getting the message across in a memorable way. Writer Scott Z. Burns produced the script and Steven Soderbergh mold this story with great skill. The cast is filled with major actors but in a film of this size few of them are given much screen time.<br /><br />Interestingly the film begins with the marker 'Day 2' and the significance of that move is held until the film's satisfying end. Beth Emhoff (Gweneth Paltrow) is returning home form a business trip in Hong Kong, has a layover in Chicago where she calls her husband Mitch (Matt Damon) informing him of the delay. She arrives home ill and son is dead form a seizure disorder brought on by encephalitis - and infection of unknown type that has spread to her brain. Soon after her death her son dies leaving Mitch terrified by the unknown disease. The US Center for Disease control is headed by Dr. Cheever (Lawrence Fishbine) who engages Dr Mears (Kate Winslet) and Dr. Hextall (Jennifer Ehle) and Dr. Sussman (Elliott Gould) to investigate the disease. The World Heath Organization represented by Dr. Leonora Orantes (Marion Cotillard) becomes involved as the point of origin of the disease seems to be Hong Kong: her attempt to help the Chinese is at first assisted by young Sun Feng (Chin Han) until the Chinese forces decide to hold her hostage until the vaccine can be sent to save a province in China. As the contagious disease is studied, identified, and a vaccine becomes available some smarmy people such as 'journalist' Alan Krumwiede (Jude Law) goes on the internet blogging the use of forsythia as the cure, bilking millions of dollars around the world for his fake cure. The story is both catastrophic and immediate as Soderbergh intentionally develops personal stories to demonstrate how a severe contagious disease can impact both throngs of peoples and individuals as well.<br /><br />The supporting cast is filled with fine actors and the momentum of the story is almost intolerable fast. Steven Soderbergh provides his own cinematography and the electrifying musical score is by Cliff Martinez. This is a fine cinematic accomplishment and one that should be seen by every citizen in the world - for many reasons.

B005GVF95O|4.0|Good for entertaining little one on road trips. She's 5 &amp; thinks it's pretty easy, so it's good for about 10 minutes or so, then she's ready to move on.
0385534639|4.0|I do not generally read fiction, but this was quite an enjoyable read.  Fun, fast paced, and not anything wasted.

0385528752|5.0|Very insightful and very clever!  A must read for anyone in business or government.  It ain't easy to turn that elephant.
0762777931|5.0|I bought this book after I bought a copy for my sister (she wanted it for her birthday).  I was immediately interested.  Author makes things simple and takes a fun friendly approach rather than a lecturing style (about diet, health, etc.).  My sister and I are partnering up to start the cleanse next Sunday.  I am looking forward to it as I am tired of feeling tired, low energy and I feel like my eating habits need to change. I've tried the green juice and it is delicious.  There are many good recipes included and I like to try new things, even if they are \\"healthy\\".  I will be back to update after I finish my cleanse.  I am hoping I will feel better and more energized.  I highly recommend this book if you are looking to eat better, fresh and healthy or are having any health problems.  Diet is really important.
B0063IH60K|5.0|this app has all the quality as the original card game, but with some added features as well. fun to play, and you can deal a winning deal as long as you are connected to wi~fi. well worth the space it takes up on my kindle fore considering it was free:)
030726999X|2.0|I was completely enamored with Stieg Larsson's first book in this trilogy, \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\".  What I found endearing with this first book was lost in the second and third books.  I am a big fan of plot twists and the \\"keep them guessing till the last page\\" type of mysteries.  In the first book I was literally on the edge of my seat and even though not surprised at who did it was totally taken back by why they did it.  Unfortunately the second and third books this element was removed.  You know right away who the main characters are and what they are planning to do.<br />Salander (the girl) will always be a character I will endear to, even though I am not a 90 pound girl.  I have always been a fan of \\"the odd\\" and loved the way that Mr. Larsson developed Salander.<br />Where the second and third books fall flat (in my opinion) they do make up for with background as to why Salander is the way she is.  If you are looking for a predictable read, with very few surprises then I recommend both the second and third book.<br />Cheers.
B004UID2LC|1.0|this app is okay but after the update it gets really bad. if your looking for a good youtube downloder get tube mate. it works very good.

B006MQRLSA|1.0|Moneyball is a strong film and one of Brad Pitt's best performances. But Amazon's instant streaming is very disappointing. I'm streamed hundreds of films on Netflix with no problems whatsoever. The Amazon service delivered a low-resolution picture that stopped three times to download the rest of the file. And even though I paid the purchase price, the file won't play on my iPad or iPhone. I won't be buying this product from Amazon again.

B0028MBKVG|4.0|JeriWB.com Teacher Writer Traveler<br /><br />Rare is the book that gets its readers to take action. What is it about Christopher Mcdougallfs nonfiction book Born to Run that made me want to go for a jog after not running since my stint as a middle school sprinter? The book starts with the authorfs doctor visit prompted by the common runnerfs question, gWhy does my foot hurt?h<br /><br />In his search to uncover why our bodies are so suited to distance running, Mcdougall journeys to the Cooper Canyons of Mexico where he encounters the Tarahumara Indians. They (men, women, and children) are known for running barefoot and injury-free for extremely long distances. Their unlikely athletic success provides a jumping off point for the author to question all that modern medicine and our western mindset would have us believe makes sense when it comes to running ability.<br /><br />The author captures the eccentric personalities of many ultra-runners as he weaves in a wealth of researched information including why a human can outrun a horse or what is appealing about races like the Leadville Trail 100 Run. The book ends with a 100-mile race that takes place on the Tarahumarafs turf. Along the way, the reader senses that ultra-racing has more in common with the human spirit than the competitive spirit.<br /><br />The mysterious figure of Caballo Blanco runs throughout the story as a representation of runningfs real rewards. While most of us are not daring enough to drop-out of society and go where our bliss leads us, there is something to be said about uncovering the truths behind why running shoes do more harm to your feet than good, as well as why an ultra-runner in their 60s can still compete with runners 40 years younger, and why its one of the few sports where women compete equally with men.<br /><br />I jog because I can. Does a person really need more reason?<br /><br />[...]

0062101897|5.0|I don't want to toot my own horn but this gift was ranked the best amongst the family. It was on GMA and I knew my grandfather would flip over this but the price was steep. Oh, but not on Amazon. I saved over 40 bucks and he hasn't put it down since Christmas. If you have someone who's a HUGE fan like my grandfather is than you have to get them this book.
B005GVF95O|5.0|Sad to admit this, but, I actually look forward to superman's one star reviews as much as seeing what the free app of the day is.  He is a troll, but a hilarious one and gives me a daily chuckle.  Thanks.  My three year old loves playing with my Kindle Fire (kudos to my extended warranty coverage!) so I am always looking for fun educational apps for him. I am sure he will like this one. It is simple enough, but not so easy that it will bore him.  I don't think I would pay $1.99 for it though.  It only has fourteen little puzzles.  So I am glad that this is the FAotD and will look at other apps from this company.  Graphics are nice.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|haven't gotten this update everyone is talking about. could be better though. only played about ten games thus far. almost too many games to keep track of, good initiative though.
0802473156|5.0|Guys:  This was a great book.  My girlfriend and I read it on my sister's recommendation.  I don't want this to turn some off to the book, but IT'S a FRIGGIN' ROAD MAP!  It will tell you exactly what your wife/girlfriend needs from you to feel loved.  If you love her and she doesn't feel loved, there's a disconnect.  Period.  End of story.  This will help with that disconnect.  Buy the book.  Buy two...  It'll be the best $15 you ever spend.
B005SJIP2S|5.0|I got this disk for Christmas.  I have been a Yes fan since the 70's.  I love Jon Anderson's voice, but I have to say that Benoit David's voice is excellent on this disk.  The music is fantastic and a good choice of pieces for the album.  I definitely recommend this to any casual or serious Yes fan.

B005TZFZJC|3.0|Rihanna's next album is out only one year, and she already brings us a new one. Nevertheless, Talk That Talk is a strong performance. In this album, Rihanna chooses even more the road to electronicly inspired, danceable music, featuring influences of dubstep and house, but not leaving her R&B-roots.  This deluxe edition presents the album in a wonderful, four-flap cover, including a photo booklet and two alternative cd-box cover cards.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|some games are fun but overrall system is a little confusing. you have to accomplish a certain level of points before you can move on.
B00421VQWE|5.0|One More Love is an amazing album with diamonds of dance music tracks. It shows the development of David Guetta as a dance music artist. The influence of the American R&B/Hip-Hop side has grown bigger, allthough the house music inspiration stays the most important factor. The collaboration with other great artists (Akon, will.i.am, Ne-Yo, Rihanna, KiD CuDi, Afrojack, Madonna, Lil Wayne, LMFAO, Fergie...) takes his music to a higher level.  This deluxe edition presents the album in a great cover, which makes it beauty for your music cd collection.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|it is perfect! I love studying the Bible on this app ;) it gibes me a fresh take on it, and being able to cross reference other versions gives me greater understanding.

Someone shows some guts and clears the barn of walkers. Now if Rick's wife wasn't pregnant, maybe they could FINALLY leave Yawning Acres. Bring Maggie along though...she's cute!   Maybe this signifies a turning point in season 2, and we'll see less melodrama and more terror. Injecting a few new characters wouldn't hurt...another alpha male perhaps.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this is a neat app because its one download for a variety of games. it gives you incentives to keep playing. would recommend to anyone.
B004H1V5RU|5.0|I bought three of these puzzlea and the Epic is the hardest.  Worked with it for hours and did not get to the end but love it and will keep on trying.  It is as challenging as the golf ball and tee in water puzzle but with so much complexity that it keeps you going.

B0043URV5U|5.0|This CD is the best and being mastered by one of my favorite artists just doesn't get any better. Sure helps get work done faster on the computer listening to this.
0896600009|4.0|The reason for 4 stars instead of 5 stars is that this book is enormous and very heavy.  Atleast the one I received - there may be different sizes.  It is beautiful and brings back memories of a Norman Rockwell book we had growing up.  It is indeed the best Norman Rockwell book available and a FANTASTIC historical perspective of the U.S.

It has worked wonders for me, and if your doctor approves of the plan then this is the book to start with.<br /><br />Te formatting isn't suitable for Kindle Fire or any I the smaller Kindle readers, but it looks flawless on the iPad Kindle App.  Something to keep in mind.  I would buy the paper copy before trying to read it on a real Kindle, but not before reading it on a tablet.
B005GVF95O|5.0|a little easy for my 5year old but my 22 month old loves it.  nice app, bright colors.  I appreciate a Faotd that is kid friendly and ad free.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|There isn't much more to be said than most other good reviews have already said.  The Marware cover fits my Fire PERFECTLY and adds almost no extra bulk to the size, which I am a big fan of.  My Fire snaps snugly into place (no fear of it falling out) and when used, the cover works perfectly as a stand for watching movies.  The case does not cover the power button, USB, headphone jack or speakers.  This is a great item.

0439023513|3.0|I really liked the first two books in this trilogy, but Mockingjay didn't grab me as much.  Characters that were so vibrant in the first two books seemed inconsistent and one-dimentional here.  There are peripheral characters who aren't developed, then just killed off.  Also, the imagery wasn't as vivid as in the first two books - I had trouble visualizing the scenes as described, which definitely wasn't an issue before.  Not a bad book, but not the best of the series.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its one of those games that you just keep playing one more time then one more time turns to fifteen more times. they are fairly easy games to learn and addictive to play
B005K17RU0|5.0|the app works great on the kindle but I don't like the default weather in my notification. did not have any issues with the app

B005FITIGO|4.0|With the absence of checks and balances to ensure proper banking practices,came the corporate world's ruthlessness at it's very worst.When a man who has given 19 years of productive and loyal service,is frog marched out of the office,the staff know many of them will be next. And they are.<br />The joke however is on the firm. Once whizkid Peter Sullivan (Zachary Quinto)has accessed his former bosses last project, he is horrified to discover that trading will soon exceed the volatility levels used by the firm to calculate risk. (It's a bit like waiting for Mount Vesuvius to erupt, fallout will be disastrous.)<br />The head honcho's are called in to try and stem the blood flow,but the greatest irony is that the man they sacked earlier that day,Eric Dale(Stanley Tucci) is not contactable because they (the firm) disconnected his cell phone when they sacked him that same morning !<br />Throughout the story one can see that not all the key players will still have a job at the end of the trading day - Sarah Robertson (Demi Moore) and Jared Cohen (Simon Baker) occupy similar positions,with Jared having the ruthlessness and ice-water running through his veins so necessary to survive,and he has the ear of the the Managing Director John Tuld (Jeremy Irons). So it is Sarah Robertson who is told to fall on her sword and be the scapegoat - despite her telling Tuld a year earlier that the firm was heading for financial disaster.<br />In the end Tuld gives the orders to the traders to sell,sell,sell,as soon as trading opens.Their reward is a seven figure sum for selling worthless assets to the people they do business with. I wondered how many of them realised those large sums of money promised,will have to last them a long time - they won't be picked up by their clients because of what they done to them,and their names will be black listed throughout the finance industry.<br />To cap it all,the film was gripping,with a strong cast led magnificently by Jeremy Irons,and well supported by Kevin Spacey,Stanley Tucci,Zachary Quinto,Simon Baker,Paul Bettany and Demi Moore.<br />Whilst not without a few (minor) flaws,Margin Call was - like Wall Street before it - a fascinating look inside the corporate world and at how little responsibility (or concern for investors) when through their own poor management,they run the country into enormous debt,causing mass hardship and job losses.
0071636080|5.0|This is one of the books you can imagine how helpful could be... You have to read it to discover the greatest secrets of Steve Jobs prior and during his amazing presentations. Nowadays is a great source for presenters in search or excellence in their presentations.

Even if you don't like his style for clothes, if you are into modern art you will be able to appreciate the stunning photography and display this book provides. If you are a designer, than you will marvel at the intricate design and how perfect fabrics were chosen to lay or look a certain way. If you are into fashion, it will take your breath away. There are many designs in this book that are not \\"my taste\\" per se, but I still looked at the entire book in awe. This will be a coffee table favorite for years to come.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|good game has a lot to offer. it is slightly addicting its easy to loose track of time. slightly annoying that you have to win points to buy new games but hey it makes the game last longer
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This app is challenging, fun, and has many games to chose from! I also like the fact that it gives u extra credits for all of your continuous play! !! I enjoy it!
B005HSL626|4.0|I'm a nanny, taking care of 4 children. When boredom strikes these kids, it's nearly impossible to complete anything! But getting this game was a great idea. They sit for a while quietly playing while I complete certain tasks. Or when we are taking a long car ride! Oh my, this game is a great way to keep them happy while we are out and about! If your a parent, or nanny, I recommend the game, it will SAVE YOUR SANITY! God bless!

B0038M61JQ|5.0|I am a jazz guitar player and \\"student\\" of Joe's recordings. I probably learned more about jazz chord work from this album as any album that I have owned. As such, I'd deem it a \\"must buy\\" for all aspiring jazz guitarists. Joe was truly the \\"textbook jazz guitar player\\", in my opinion, and the closest thing there has been to a template when it comes to jazz chord work. What distinguishes him, in my mind, is his choice of chord forms, which were always very solidly and logically constructed. Nothing overly esoteric, just \\"meat and potatoes\\", essential stuff, that was masterfully choreographed and played. Of course, I failed to mention that Joe was a freaking monster player, his performances are breathtaking, and he could shred single line stuff with the best of them. The \\"Virtuoso\\" title ain't no lie. The man was flawless in his execution, and his sense of time was as solid as any guitarist that has ever walked the earth. For someone woodshedding on jazz guitar, there's enough meat and potatoes here to feed most mortals for a couple of lifetimes. It will be a long time before anyone ever surpasses what Joe Pass was able to do with a guitar.
B000001DTM|5.0|U2 was at a crucial moment after the backlash from Rattle & Hum. Many figured they peaked with The Joshua Tree and would never come close to that again. Honestly, I was one of them.   But they made this amazing album and headed out on tour. What they did on the road speaks to the power of this album.  From the first night of the ZooTV tour in Lakeland, Florida, they began each concert with EIGHT SONGS FROM THE ALBUM. This is dangerous in 2 ways. One, those in attendance may lose interest quickly. Two, press from all over the world show up at the first show and tell everyone what they thought. A few bad reviews (even when the vast majority of the reviews are positive) and poor early attendance can create a very negative vibe on the tour, as U2 found out with Pop and Popmart later on.  But U2 braved the potential dangers of eight songs and pulled it off. As the tour went on, the AB songs became a hits package as much as being from the latest album. And 20 years after the album's release, the songs continue to be vital in U2's performances.  So yes, Achtung Baby is the best album of U2's career. The Joshua Tree turned out not to be their peak, but it is a close second.

B001TH16DI|3.0|(Actually 3.5 stars)<br /><br />I'm not the type to get bothered by the intricacies of \\"absolutely perfect to the last pixel and decibel and must be from the hand of God only\\" debates and demands. As long as there are no obvious artifacts, and it looks and sounds nice n' clear, it's good enough for me. If it looks, however slightly, better than the DVD, then it's a welcome bonus. This set has all of those issues taken care of, so there it is -- good picture and sound.<br /><br />The Next Gen Movie set is more straightforward than this set; in that case, all of the SE DVD extras are transferred, and the movies are simply as is, no \\"special editions.\\" Here, with the original six movies, that doesn't always apply:<br /><br />1) The first movie is now just the regular extended edition, rather than the still-fascinating Director's Edition from the 2001 SE DVD. Also, none of the major extras from that DVD are on this Blu-Ray. Therefore, assuming you like any version of this first movie, you should keep or buy the DVD version, too.<br /><br />2) Wrath of Khan's SE DVD was another \\"Director's Edition\\" and it seems like the Blu-Ray is missing a few of the SE DVD's extras.<br /><br />3) Undiscovered Country has been reverted back to the regular edition, although the extra minute on the SE DVD is nothing much besides Scooby-Doo-level trype.<br /><br />There are two commentaries per movie, one old, one new. The new commentaries range from redundant (Nicholas Meyer returns to say mostly the same things as before) to annoying (some time is wasted of Trek 3's new cmtry. rattling on about the new \\"Battlestar Galactica\\") to generally fine and sometimes fun or informative.<br /><br />The Captain's summit is okay, as Whoopi Goldberg attempts to interview the actors who played the commanding officers of the two most famous starships Enterprise. A lot of it descends into quirkiness and jokes, but it's all in good fun.<br /><br />Of the new extras, only three of them really entertained me at all: Trek 6 has a few scenes of the Klingon \\"Hamlet\\" to watch. Trek 2 has an okay look at Trek movie relics and a discussion with movie 2 and 3 composer James Horner. The ILM documentary is fine, too.<br /><br />Trek movie rankings, worst to best: V(FF);  IX, X (I,N);  I (TMP);  VI (UC); [XI ('09)]?; VII (Gs); VIII (1C);  II to IV (WK, S4S, VH)<br /><br />It's a strange irony that the two worst TOS movies -- I and V-- have two of Jerry Goldsmith's best Trek scores. With the last two TNG movies, I and V form what I call the \\"really bad existentialist quadrilogy,\\" with V (Final Frontier) the worst and The (1st) Motion Picture the best of those four.<br /><br />The sixth movie is, for me, the start of what I call the \\"Passing the Torch\\" trilogy, which is filled out by the first (\\"better\\") two TNG movies. Trek 6 is just as informed by the presence of \\"The Next Generation\\" as it is by contemporary events. Good story, good (and very different for Trek) music score.<br /><br />Wrath of Khan, Search for Spock, and Voyage Home (2,3,4), the three best Trek movies ever, form a loose \\"Genesis/Spock trilogy,\\" with the otherwise fairly separate fourth movie bookended by the conclusion of events from the previous films (and a dab of setup for Trek 6, as it turns out), with Spock's search for himself during the movie. Amazing stories, nice visuals, great Horner scores for 2 & 3. Trek 4's score is uninspired, pedestrian, insipid; and some of the movie's humor ages better than the rest.<br /><br />Grades: V -- D- ; I -- C+ ; VI -- B ;  II-IV -- An okay look at Trek movie relics and a discussion with movie 2 and 3 composer James Horner.

B000VDUWMC|2.0|Very interesting read, but the kindle edition is disappointing as it lacks images, maps and the tables are poorly formatted.<br />I think this information should be highlighted on the [Kindle Edition] page.  As the price is almost the same as the<br />paperback edition (5 cents today), you would think you were buying an equivalent product...
B005XRU62C|5.0|I was greatly looking forward to the Coldplay album which was released the week before but when this one came out I forgot all about Coldplay.  Her voice is amazing and even though she is young she clearly knows how to explore the entire music studio for creating amazing sounds and beats.  I absolutely can't recommend giving this a listen enough, you will love it.

I definitely recommend this book. It was a real page turner. Also, I see many people complaining about the first 100 pages. I thought the beginning was great. All necessary information which develops the story that much better.

When tried to watch the DVD it had the sound from the directors review dubbed onto the pilot of the series so we were not able to watch the pilot which made the rest of the series harder to get.

B00127RAJY|5.0|I bought the Banish Fat/Boost Metabolism, Trouble Zones and this DVD to avoid a repetitive workout regimen.  I do a different workout each day and I believe the results are there.  I feel more toned and therefore, stronger and also my stamina is improving.  She alternates cardio (jumping, burpees, kickboxing, etc.) strength training (with weights for your butt, thighs and arms), and ab work.  My core strength is improving as well.  I generally didn't like plank moves before (because they're hard for me), but they're very effective and worth the effort.  These videos are all about circuits and therefore, nothing is long and drawn out and the workout goes by quickly.  You feel alive!    I think the 3 workouts she offers in the 30 day shred are great because they're 20 minutes long each and kick your butt (the 2nd and 3rd especially).  Anything becomes easier the more you do it, so to avoid a repetitive workout regimen, I alternate this video with the other 2 dvds (Banish and Trouble Zones).  Those have 40 minute workouts, so depending on how much time you have or your ambition level for the day, you can choose what works for you.  I sometimes do workout 2 and 3 from the 30 day shred if I want a longer workout, but each of them will get your blood pumping and you will break a sweat.    I think the key is, with any workout regimen, to mix things up.  I would get bored doing the same dvd everyday and so would my body- it's true that your body develops memory and you will stop seeing results if you settle into the same routine everyday.  The 30 day shred is good to this effect though because you can alternate between the 3 workouts.  So, it's a good way to go if you're only going to pick one dvd.

0345533054|3.0|I don't think I have ever given a three star to any book. Most either I love or hate. But this one truly deserves a 3 star. About 10 pages from the end, when the story was climaxing to an extremely predictable end, I put the book away not bothering to see if there would be a earth shattering, mind boggling, drop-jawed, shocking  twist. I didn't care. The characters are so boring, either perfect or totally EVIL. They don't feel real. I did not care about Will, Shiela or the Ghost. I hope Will is the bad guy in the end, although I didn't finish the book so I don't really know.<br /><br />This is a bad adventure novel, a lousy romance novel and a poor detective novel.
B003Y5H5FG|5.0|I am a huge fan of the original Fright Night, and it was one of my favorite movies as a young teen. Even though I am older I loved this movie, because it took the basic idea behind the original movie and ran with it in a very different direction. It modernized it, while not feeling like another needless remake. Honestly the movies are so different from each other that I never really compared them while watching, which is usually a flaw in remakes. Overall an awesome movie. That and David Tennent really stands out.
B0051GOB26|5.0|at Amazon's current sale price of $15.49, the Limited Ed. Blu-ray Book and Digital Copy release of the Big Lebowski is a steal. Not only are you gettting the greatest movie ever made, but you're getting it in the highest quality viewing available, AND the collector's booklet.

0312641893|4.0|I love fairy tale adaptations, whether they're just fleshing out the original story (Robin McKinley's \\"Beauty\\") or spinning the bare concept off in a totally different direction (the anime \\"Pretear\\").<br /><br />And Marissa Meyer's \\"Cinder\\" is actually quite clever in its dystopian/futuristic-steampunk reimagining of the famed Cinderella story. While it cleaves to the basic storyline of the fairy tale, Meyer weaves in a conspiracy, a brewing war, a plague and a secret identity into the story. In short, she allows the story to stand on its own two feet... or rather, one foot of its own and one robot foot.<br /><br />In the futuristic city of New Beijing, Cinder is a cyborg -- a second class citizen who toils away as a mechanic for her cruel stepmother Adri. Her only friends are her kind stepsister Peony and her quirky robot Iko.<br /><br />Then one day, crown prince Kai secretly hires her to repair an old robot for him, even as New Beijing prepares for the arrival of the cruel, powerful Lunar queen Levana (who wants to conquer Earth, possibly by marrying Kai). But Cinder's whole life is thrown upside down when Peony contracts letumosis -- a deadly plague with no cure -- and an enraged Adri sells Cinder for medical testing.<br /><br />The twist: Cinder is immune to the plague. The eccentric Dr. Erland takes an interest in her, even as Peony's condition worsens and Kai desperately searches for a way to avoid marrying Levana. But as Cinder struggles to stop the plague and save the man she's falling in love with, she begins to learn more about her own mysterious past -- and why she might be the only hope for Earth.<br /><br />\\"Cinder\\" is a brilliant example of how an author can take a well-worn fairy tale and breathe new life into it. It's a pretty decent retelling in its own right -- complete with sci-fi versions of the fairy godmother, glass slipper and evil stepmother.  But it also stands on its own as a solid science-fiction story with unique subplots, characters and backstory. THAT is a truly good retelling.<br /><br />Meyer has a strong, smooth writing style, splattered with grease, disease and squalor as well as white silk, silver and gleaming laboratories. She neatly twines together several subplots (Levana's schemes, Kai's search for the lost Lunar princess, the damaged robot, Peony's deathly illness), although I was left wondering what was going on with the crying Lunar girl. Perhaps that will be answered in the next book.<br /><br />What was the book's biggest problem? Probably the huge TO BE CONTINUED ending, and the fact that it's pretty easy to figure out Cinder's true identity. It could have used a teeny bit more mystery.<br /><br />But the strongest part of the story is our Cinderella herself. Cinder is a strong, selfless heroine who has a genuinely horrible life -- everyone looks down on her because of her cyborg parts, and she struggles with telling Prince Kai about her true nature for fear that he will be repulsed by her. At the same time, she's also struggling with the discoveries about her own past.<br /><br />Kai is also an excellent character, and quite different from your usual fairy tale prince -- he's trapped in a no-win scenario that may enslave the Earth no matter what he does. And the cast is nicely rounded out by the malevolent, vain Levana, the adorably quirky Iko, and the mysterious Dr. Erland (who is far more than he appears).<br /><br />Marissa Meyer does not disappoint in \\"Cinder,\\" the first of a series that seems to be made up of dystopian/sci-fi fairy tale adaptations. And even if the ending is a bit abrupt, it definitely leaves you craving more.r has a strong, smooth writing style, splattered with grease, disease and squalor as well as white silk, silver and gleaming laboratories.

0307593312|3.0|This novel, written by Haruki Murakami and translated from Japanese, is a highly original work, both with respect to its content and its styling.  It features two primary characters, a female assassin by the name of Aomame and a struggling novelist named Tengo, who seem originally to be unconnected but who predictably come together.<br /><br />At the start of the novel, Aomame passes through some type of space/time portal which very subtly changes the reality which she inhabits.  Over time she becomes aware of minor changes in her surroundings, such as the uniforms and weapons carried by Tokyo police and the existence of two moons in the sky.  All other details of her life remain unchanged.  She leads a Spartan existence, her only vice the occasional sexual one night stand.  That, and the fact that she murders the abusers of women at the behest of a motherly matriarch.<br /><br />Tengo becomes enmeshed in a fraudulent publishing scheme, by which he and an unscrupulous editor take the work of a dyslexic, emotionally scarred young woman and craft it into a nationwide best seller.<br /><br />This is quite a long work, and while I must admit to enjoying the first half very much, I felt the story took a decidedly negative turn as the two protagonists began to come together and elements of fantasy and magical realism began to emerge.  As in many works of this length, I can't help thinking that it could have lost 200+ pages and been a far tighter and more enjoyable work, without losing anything important.  The writing is fantastic, and captivating for as long as the author has something to write about, but as the action dissipates, so too does the pleasure of the reading experience.

B0061JPYX2|3.0|RIP to Amy Winehouse  she was an interesting artist who seemed headed toward even more with her musical career and sad that she died way too soon. as for the album that comes after death and much like Michael Jackson's album, you can tell when songs are over produced or arranged to cover up various things.  like a leaky roof that you get a bucket and towels, etc.. and you hope you have covered it enough so nobody will notice, well that is how this album sounds and feels in places.  a mis match that truly is how I'd describe her as a Artist. she had some talent, but by no means was she the second coming of fill in the blank. the Retro thing is trendy and also a Novelty that eventually wears off and also a tired gimmick. however to Winehouse's credit she had some talent and had charisma and personality to give some of the material here  feeling.
B003H6KRIE|5.0|I already own all the Bourne movies on regular DVDs and they just didn't look quite right on the new 60 in LED TV with Sony bluray player attached.  Bluray players claim to enhance regular DVDs, but it is no where near the quality you get from the real deal Bluray disks.  Every scene is crisp and clear, if I didn't know i was looking at a TV, I would think I was peering through a Window.  Overall a great addition to a burgeoning Bluray collection.
B003R50AW8|5.0|Well, what a refreshing change to find an author that writes as well as Marcus Zusak. Anyone who has read The Book Thief will understand how gifted this writer is. This novel has a little something for everyone - humour, twists, great (although somewhat offbeat) characters, some interesting messages about human interaction and of course, a good old fashioned love story. This is a great example of the talent that currently lies in Australian writing ranks - would love to see a screen version of this story.

B004XJRQUQ|1.0|These novels do not deserve their success.  They are thin, poorly charactered, and contrivedly plotted.  I'm sorry, but I despair to think that this is the kind of thing the American public apparently wants.  Sort of the literary analog of the McDonalds Big Mac and fries.  It is a shame, really, because the central conceit of the series, the fight to the death among children, could have stood as a sound base for an interesting tale.  As it is, all one gets here is a whiney, neurotic heroine surrounded by barely developed characters. Offensive and boring.  I despair.

B006INDMEE|2.0|I feel like I've seen this movie 100 times before.  It was disappointing.  A subtle mix of Hanna, Munich, and James Bond.

1584282584|5.0|I just read one of the few minor critics about this book, saying that \\"one could sum up the content to: direct your flash to the wall\\". What a troll. No, let's stay serious, this book really did change my  thinking about on-cam flash and my way of using it. There is a whole lot more than just \\"direct it to the wall\\" in this book. A lot more.  Neil van Niekerk perfectly explains the technical stuff about white balance, ratios of exposure compensation and FEC (and how to set these in practise), exposure metering, TTL, Flash Sync Speed (and highspeed sync) and first versus second curtain.  He describes how to balance ambient with flashlight and introduces the famous \\"black foamy thing\\" to flag the light (in my camera bag now forever) and he opens new horizons when he uses bounce flash outside in the city, with ISO 800...1200, bouncing of walls that are 30 meters away!  There's a lot experience and expertise in this book, but even only for the last three themes for me it would have been worth more than the money charged.

B006AZZPCM|5.0|I 've been using android for the past 2 years and i was amazingly pleased when i finally got to use tubemate.  No crashes, no errors even on low res screens (320*240). I now have Dell Streak 5 (aka the beast) and there is nothing   better than hd videos (1280*720)!It also supports mp3 files.  The good thing is that it gets updated frequently which means that it gets even better and better!!!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This is a really fun game! I am a teenage girl and I like trying to beat the different GAMES! the only thing I don't like is the games can be a bit hard.
B0053VKP8S|4.0|Bought last summer for our new Samsung Plasma TV which only has Digital output.  I wanted to connect to my old school NAD 200 watt component receiver which does not have a digital input.  I usually figure this stuff out quick and only had a little time to fuss with it.  The digital Toslink connections did not seem to fit properly and the blue light did not come on.  The directions are printed in very small print and this made it a little tough too.  I thought I would get back to it but never did until today.  I read another review about removing the plastic caps on the Toslink cable.  That did the trick.  Works fine now.  I hope you will not succumb to my stupid error and will remove the platic caps on the Toslink cable.  I am now happy with my purchase and was not looking forward to trying to return or contact customer support 6 months later!

0061969656|5.0|\\"Death of Kings\\" is the latest installment of the Saxon Tales series by Bernard Cornwell. The setting of the series is during the Middle Ages in what is now present day England. Uhtred of Bebbanberg is the protagonist of the tales. He is a brash, confident and sometimes arrogant man who finds himself in the thick of the countless Danish invasions during the time period. For those new to the series they could start with this book, but I would not reccomend it. Instead I would go to the first book entitled \\"The Last Kingdom\\". For veterans of the series this book does not disappoint.   For me, I felt like Uhtred finally comes into his own and his relationship with Edward marks a much different approach then the distant relationship shared between Uhtred and Edward's father Alfred. Not only does Uhtred commit to Wessex but he finally decides to commit to himself. Also, it would seem that Cornwell somewhat slips out of his formula of the last few novels and surprises us with twists and turns that we unexpected.   Usually, the bashing of Christianity by Uhtred in the novels wears on me. However, I found it interesting how Christianity is taking a bigger part in the plot and how important it was for the foundation of a united England. As always Cornwell delivers a delightful tale and a great addition to what has become my favorite series in Historical Fiction.
098478280X|5.0|I bought this book for my wife who was preparing for interviews. She was very thrilled, find her comments below.  This is an excellent book. This book gives you an idea of the types of questions that you will be asked in interviews, especially if you're going to interview with MSFT, Google, Yahoo, Apple or Amazon.If you know this book up and down AND can answer similar questions without much issue, you should not have much trouble answering the coding questions.   If you are planning to go for a coding-related interview, don't go without going over this book. It is more than worth its price. My gratitude goes to the author.
B003R0MF5S|5.0|A great season of Chuck. Sadly looses it's flavor for a while then re- gains it.  Leaves you wanting to see next season.
B005974CNA|5.0|Won't repeat the outstanding reviews previous, but what initially struck me was James LaBrie's voice and how great he sounded. Have not heard him sound this great in a long time. Had the pleasure to see them live in Mesa, Arizona in Dec. '11 and as always they were fantastic. The ballad songs have taken a little to get used to, I think there are three of them. This would be a great \\"starter\\" album for someone who has not ever listened to DT in my opinion. Music was extremely complex with awesome time signature changes. On each listen I try to single out and listen to Myung, Petrucci, Mangini and Rudess individually as they play and it is a treat to my ears. This was a fantastic album, can't wait until the next one. Mike Mangini was absolutely outstanding as the new guy.
B004LWZW4M|5.0|This is one of THE best sci-fi movies put out on 2011. I cant say enough about how much I liked this movie. The apes really looked like Apes. The character Cesar was just incredible. It looks like they have finally produced a movie that lives up to the greatness of the Planet of the Apes genre.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is a great game you have to earn points to get games.  There is about 5 starter games so far so good  Ps great on kindle fires
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Thank you for such a great and easy app.  I now take my tablet to church ;  It is so quick between books chapters etc. We use it every day with our devotions and have just started the Joyce Meyer 365 Day readind plan/devotion.  This app is worth it at any price, and most of my friends have it to.
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|The game play is fun, however, there are too many  advertisements. If fact some adds fill the entire screen stopping play all together. The game also has a tendency to freeze up or reset it's self.
B005GVF95O|5.0|Cute, simple &amp; fun for the younger ones.  I love the variety given to us in the daily free apps &amp; wish the whiners would go away.
B00127RAJY|5.0|Just started this the other day, warning: no where does it say you need a set of weights, and you totally need a set of weights. 3 or 5 lb dumbbells work fine. My were feeling it after one day, and I'm in it for the long haul, so hopefully I'll update this soon with my progress! :)
B005I6EVUG|5.0|I bought this cover along with my new kindle fire and I love it  it fits the kindle perfectly and is good looking and stylish  It looks exactly like the one on the picture, so there is no mislead there  This is not a hard cover to protect your kindle from bumps or so, and I am extremely careful with my gadget so I cant tell much about the protectiveness qualities of this case  The case will look like \\"semi-open\\" on your kindle when you first place it, so at first I though it wasn't fitting properly, but in a couple of days the leather loosens up a bit and then closed just well. So, don't worry if that happens to you  I only have had this for a little over a month, so I cant tell you anything about the resistance of the cover  overall I'm in love with it: beautiful and well made  Ah, I also feel more safe reading my books on a public place on something that does look like a book, instead of an obvious tablet looking sleeve or something like that
B0055SWM08|5.0|my first ever game I bought on my kindle. let me tell you it was worth it. the music is zen like, the gameplay is simple.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|What?!? if you dare give angery birds seasons a bad review you is a hater man plain and simple and its free!!!
B0063IH60K|4.0|never played this on my home computer, but love it on my kindle fire!  It is so fun :) try it!!!
B004OBQQPY|5.0|This film is a gift to anyone who has followed Formula 1.  To see the behind-the-scenes life of Senna puts his victories and talent into better perspective.  He had a true talent and drive that is rarely matched.  It was exciting to follow him when he was alive, this film makes me appreciate him even more as a driver and humanitarian.  Thank you to all that had a hand in the making of this.
B00008WT49|5.0|After playing this SACD, I know what Nora Jones means by the title of this adventure.  Her vocals really stand out vs. a regular CD.  The instrumentation is something else also, it's amazing how SACD brings out all the subtle background sounds and effects you do not hear on regular CD's.  As soon as the first track starts playing, you get swept away and before you know it, it's over.  You can really tell both the artist and musicians cared about what was laid down on track.  I really wish music companies would just sell hybrid SACDs, at current prices you can't tell me that each layer of a musical release from the artist, musicians, and management can't make a profit with a release selling for $15 per copy.  Got distracted away from Nora, if you like pristine sounding music, get this SACD!
B000024D4R|4.0|Pink Floyd / Animals (1992 remastered CD...printed in USA):  Evidently, after \\"Dark Side\\", some folks forgot that Pink Floyd was always a Progressive Rock band and not a Pop hit maker.  Animals is a %100 Progressive album and a very good one as well.  This is far from being a `masterpiece' but it's an album every music lover ought to have anyway.  As a slight matter of preference, I like the old 1992 remaster over the 2011 remaster, but both are excellent.  Four Stars.
