B00AAQRNQ8|4|This mouse has a good \\"feel\\" to it. Although I don't know how I feel about the rubberized grip for your thumb, it seems to make me feel sweaty. Build quality seems good and the software isn't too obnoxious. Mouse tracking is very smooth and configurable.
B0082RHRHC|5|I had forgotten so much of this book and was so glad to re-read it.  There is so much depth to it.  This is one of my all time favorite books.  I love the honor and character that Jane Eyre had and the different characters in the book that influenced her for good and bad.  It is good to get back to the old classics.
B00G5G7EXY|5|Although this is a kids movie I found it very fun to watch. It had great laughs and a good story line.
B00I29VGMC|5|I couldn't put the book down! Be prepared to feel every emotion! Absolutely loved the story and will recommend to all my friends!
B00IUBXPEY|2|I don't get this series at all.  The writing is aimed at teenagers and the lead sounds like a 40 year smoker.  Guess I'm getting old, will probably go yell about kids on my lawn now and reminisce about how much better movies were without CGI.
B00992CF6W|5|This is the best game I ever played.I Like getting a pet. Also<br /> The limitless
6305363668|4|I'd seen the original several times, I'd read mixed review's of the director's cut, I thought I'd need to watch it a couple times at least to decide.  Not so.  I didn't miss the narration a bit.  Killing that single-track voice-over of why Deckard is saved frees up the moment for a world of more interesting musings.  The movie grows from a very good futuristic private-eye flick to so much more.  Let's hear it for the Director's Cut.
B00FX8FY14|5|Love it
B00DYWO09I|1|Does not support Nexus 5
B00BAXFJ5M|5|Difficult to put down.  Loved the story.  Twists and turns thru out the book.
B004TI5N38|5|Great read!
B009ZQC7MY|5|This is simply a great show - with great characters, from a fascinating and changing period in history.  But be sure to watch it in proper order: start with season 1 and get into the story.
B001UV4XIS|5|The DVD arrived in just a few days after I placed the order. Everything was in order. Parcel was well packaged.
B001AW156U|1|Started cracking and falling off just after a month of minimal use
B00003Q43A|2|It had very good fx, but was a very stupid movie...like when Will Smith got into a dogfight with an alien craft and won(luckly), walks up to the craft opens the hatch and punches the alien in the face....it was a kids movie. why is it aliens always have arms, fingers,two eyes,one head, and its allways a round saucer...wish hollywood would make a real alien movie, the closest one so far was Alien 1. on another note I think aliens have already been here its just that we don't have the preception to understand, just like us walking over a blade of grass....
1603427244|4|The book was not exactly as I expected.  It's focus is only on casting off & casting on.  However it does cover these two subjects very throughly.
B00DP3IESY|5|I'm NOT a fan of Tom Cruise.  I don't go for action, action, action or neat graphics instead of a plot as in the last 3 Star Wars movies.  What an utter disappointment those were, however Oblivion is probably the most realistic and probable SiFi movie to date.  After reading some of the reviews I was a little skeptical and wasn't expecting much, but the movie was well worth my time.  Actually I purchased the movie and will find it rewarding to watch at a later date.  Not 20 times mind you, but worth watching again or even a 3rd time because it's a thinkers movie.  I really believe that's why some of the other reviews are so low... These are people who are fans of action, gushy romance and having everything \\"told\\" to them.  No real thinkers in MHO.  The HD experience and visuals are breathtaking and even Tom Cruise's performance was refreshing.  Realistically most movies are 4/5 stars as there are always problems/errors with a concept, plot or technical aspect of any movie, but Oblivion deserves 5 stars because of so many 1 star ratings that I can't for the life of me understand.
B00KHD5FK0|5|Excellent movie!! Excellent storyline, great action and special effects. Acting was very good. 3D effect was pretty good. We're loving the Marvel movies. Recommended!!<br /><br />Can't wait for Avengers II

B00004XPPE|5|Released in the same year as Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove, Fail Safe suffered in comparison with the similarly-themed and more famous film, which had been released first. This is a shame, because it is an excellent political thriller.<br /><br />Sidney Lumet made his classic films such as 12 Angry Men, Serpico, Network and The Verdict work so well because of those films' focus on characters and a claustrophobic setting. For Fail Safe he created this sense of  claustrophobia, by shooting the majority of scenes in either small, windowless and sparsely furnished rooms within the White House and Pentagon; SAC Command Center dominated by the screen upon which the drama in the sky is unfolding; and aboard the cockpit of Air Force bomber. There is no musical score throughout the  movie, further underscoring the sparseness of the film's atmosphere. The conversations between the President of the United States and the Soviet premier are tense and believable, an effect achieved largely through the use of Larry Hagman as an interpreter rather than having the two leaders speaking directly to each other.  As time passes, and the stakes grow higher, the tension is cranked up until the US President, is forced to make a horrific decision in order to assuage Soviet suspicions.<br /><br />The cast is uniformly excellent from top to bottom. In the White House bunker, Henry Fonda as the President gives one of those leading man portrayals for which he was known. He brings just the right blend of authority and humanity to the role. Larry Hagman looks startlingly young and trim as the President's Russian language interpreter.  His mannerisms, such as the blink of his eyes, are very much in evidence as his way of conveying to the President what the Soviet Party Chairman is saying and thinking.<br /><br />In Pentagon War Room, Walter Matthau as a political scientist the is a dark individual with a cold analytical streak that is soon unmasked to reveal a streak of military fanaticism. Counterbalancing him is Dan O'Herlihy as Colonel  Black, the voice of reason throughout.  The Black character is a framing device for the entire film; it is his recurring nightmare that opens the film and it is the reality of that nightmare that ends it. O'Herlihy's work in Fail-Safe is among the finest of his 50-year film and television acting career. At SAC headquarters in Omaha, both Frank Overton and Fritz Weaver are memorable as senior air force officials dealing with the crisis, and in Anchorage, Ed Binns is effective as the pilot of the lead bomber.<br /><br />Beyond the cast, the most striking aspect of the film is the atmosphere it creates. The film is in black and white; it's lit from above or the sides creating a stark and sparse environment. This look and feel is uniformly maintained throughout the duration of the film as well as at all its locations. In fact, there is much about Fail Safe that is suggestive of the  film noir genre, from the visual style to the mental distress of the principal characters.<br /><br />By dint of its basic plausibility, its suspenseful script, and the uniform excellence of its cast, it is the epitome of cold war films, on par with its contemporaries dealing with the same subject: Dr. Strangelove and The Bedford Incident.

B0012GMVQC|4|Jeff Beck is one of the great artists of the electric guitar. After Hendrix (who is in a class of his own), Beck is one of the greatest. Unlike many others, he covers a broad musical spectrum, incluing hard rock, more or less straight blues, jazz fusion, more or less straight jazz, and classical (bent his own way, of course).<br /><br />In Guitar Shop, Beck continues his journey. Not as groundgreaking as his very early work--with the Yardbirds--he replaced, and improved upon, Eric Clapton), and not as revolutionary as his work with the Jeff Beck Group (Truth and Beck-Ola). Not cutting edge jazz fusion (Wired and Blow by Blow), it still stands head and shoulders above virtually anyone else playing on electric guitar!<br /><br />Buy it, but don't stop hear!
B0001WTVUW|3|Well acted, not enough missle activity leading to actual city blast.devastation scenes as they occurred, all we saw of the impacts were mainly mushroom clouds, not a bad movie, 6-7 out of 10

B00DQC2FPM|5|This was fun and as expected for the child I purchased for.  Lego is a great toy and learning experience.
B000GFLAI0|5|As is not unusual with a Dylan album, I had to listen to Modern Times twice through before the greatness of it began to sink in. That might be because on the first listen, I could hardly wait for the next song (I hadn't allowed myself to hear so much as a clip before I bought the record). So songs like Thunder on the Mountain, Someday Baby, Rollin' and Tumblin', and When the Deal Goes Down, and Beyond the Horizon seemed long and not particularly inventive. My view of these songs changed as I gave myself the time to absorb them. While these songs are obviously not his best, they are still very strong material and help prop up the absolute genius of the other songs. <br /> <br />Workingman's Blues #2, like Mississippi, is a moving latter-years Dylan lament. It is beautiful and sincere, perfectly phrased. Dylan's voice has in my opinion never been as expressive and emotive as it is in this song. <br /> <br />With its descending bass line, Spirit on the Water has the kind of light touch that I would almost expect from Van Morrison. It sounds to me like the most personal song on the record. <br /> <br />Nettie Moore is a strange song that never lets you get too comfortable. The melody line takes a few unexpected turns and the lyrics are perfectly honed. I really think Dylan's lyrics have gotten better, not worse with age. In the mid-60's, when Dylan invented rock music as we know it now, Dylan's lyrics were brilliant and unfocused. Since Oh Mercy, Dylan has used words more sparingly, and to my mind, greater effect. Every word has a purpose and a place. Nothing's wasted here. <br /> <br />Ain't Talkin' is for me the greatest song on the album, and the greatest Dylan song since the 70's. It gave me goosebumps in a way I haven't had since first hearing Foot of Pride. It was the kind of epiphany I had when I first heard Like a Rolling Stone.  <br /> <br />Musically, the arrangments are more austere than Love and Theft, but the band is fantastic.  <br /> <br />I recognize that this album is not the equal of Blood on the Tracks, Highway 61, Blonde on Blonde, and a few others perhaps. But I judge a record against contemporary records. If those Dylan albums came out today, they'd break the 5 star ceiling. Modern Times is one of the best records of the millenium and is yet another high point in the career of an American legend. I don't think 5 stars is inappropriate; the current music culture is many times richer today than it was on August 28 because of Modern Times.
0316055433|1|This story started out with a lot of potential, but got progressively more unreadable as the tale droned on.  Only character I enjoyed was the dog.  With 200 more pages left, i just can't force myself to read another page.  At this point, its more like a punishment to continue reading...<br /><br />Don't buy into the hype for this book...it is AWFUL!!
B000MV9026|3|I specifically ordered this movie for my niece in college as a valentine's day gift. It was to be a study break movie. I  chose this company because it said new, sealed package, as from the factory. This is not what I received! The package was inserted in the mailer with the broken seal end inserted in the envelope mailer first. So when you opened the package, it appeared new and the seal appeared unbroken. This is not what the product claim was and not what I ordered. The price was good, and I am familiar with the movie, but I ordered a new copy! I did not have time to return it and order another copy, so I kept it, but I will never order from this vendor again! Why try to be deceptive, and think you can fool the consumer, as if I would not notice the way it was packaged? Bah! Humbug! Shame on you!
6305205620|5|This dvd set is the best one i have yet. For the money you get a load of extras ,great sound and great video. It is Metallica at there best , and if you are a Metallica fan you should own this dvd.
B00005Y7KX|5|Notre Dame de Paris is an amazing theatrical expirience. Having been performed in french, english, italian, russian and spanish. I recomend this DVD to anyone who has heard any version of the Luc Plamondon version of The Huntchback of Notre Dame.
B002ZG996I|5|My youngest was home from college on break and caught the last part of this movie on TV. She always said she wanted to find it to buy, so I ordered it from Amazon and by the time she was back at school it was in her mailbox! She loves the movie and I loved that the price and service were great as always.
0066620996|4|“Good to Great” puts a new perspective on why many businesses hit a glass ceiling as they fall into a fallacy that they are good enough to perform their function. The book concentrates the examination of different companies that succeeded in going from good to great while attempting to warn about the dangers of those who do not break the threshold. The book contains many great ideas, such as the hedgehog concept, the level 5 leadership, and establishing a culture of discipline. Using these ideas, managers are encouraged to adapt these ideas for their own companies in order for them to break through the enemy of great, good. Many businesses believe that they are good enough, and therefore, will never reach greatness.<br />Jim Collin’s book is a little out dated as he uses Circuit City as a company that went from good to great. While the store may have prospered and did go to great, it may make future generation doubt the integrity of the concept. He also warns that technology should not be dependent to run a business. There are many small businesses that may see the advantage to this concept; many types of businesses are using technology to run a well working machine. Collin’s reasoning was the fall of the Dotcoms during the early 2000 that caused trouble to many startups at the time. Today, we all know that technology is far more reliable and it is a definite key in improving.<br />It is unfair, however, to discredit the book due to the fact that the book is a little old. The ideas are unique and excellent for those who are new to the management scene and continuous improvement. It is easy to read and provides steps to admitting that a company is not to their full potential and how to fix those shortcomings.

0062060554|4|Having a grandmother with dementia, I have been curious about what it would be like to not remember everything.  On the surface it would be awful.  You forget who your loved ones are and the cherished memories disappear forever.  However, there are some benefits.<br /><br />My grandmother went through some traumatic events and they never left her mind, causing her to be depressed or angry at times.  It was like a wound that never fully heals.  But when the dementia finally took over, those painful memories were wiped out.  She may not remember who I am or the happy events of her life, but she is the happiest I've ever known her, free from the burdens of horrible recollections she's been saddled with her whole life.<br /><br />Although this book is about amnesia, it also explores the idea of what it would be like if you couldn't remember you past and had to rely on others memories.  It would be a helpless position and you'd be forced to believe that everyone was honest or else face the consequence that you'd end up completely paranoid about always being deceived.<br /><br />I enjoyed this book a lot and recommend it to anyone looking for an easy, suspenseful novel that explores an interesting topic.
B003HTPHSQ|1|I purchased this because I love the blues & Jonny Lang is Fantastic! Well, it had been a long time since I heard Cyndi (the 80's), & her voice is still the girly-pop voice that does not lend well to the blues. It is annoying. I don't understand how she got BB King, Jonny, & Charlie Musselwhite to join in on this. It's going in the next garage sale. If you like the blues, check out the VERY young Jonny Lang's \\"Lie to Me\\".
B0001NBMBC|3|come on!!!-every one saying this is slipknots best album must be on drugs!!-no way does it even come close to the sheer brutality and brilliance of iowa and as for the accoustic tracks-well one would have been bearable but 4????-hope they bring back ross robinson 2 produce the next album-rick rubin has all but taken away the sound that made this band so special in the 1st place
B006LSZECO|4|I wanted to read the next page almost to the end of the book. Lots of suspects along the way. And best twist in recent memory.<br />Ending was just OK...probably because it couldn't possibly live up to the expectations set by what came before it

B007SGLZP8|5|As usual he has written another wonderful book.  He is one of my favorite authors and I read anything he writes even the books he wrote for young adults.  Can hardly wait for the next one.
B0054JZC6E|4|This app is excellent for anyone wanting something with very brief games. You start with just a few (about 10), and you earn points that you use to &quot;buy &quot; more. That also doesn't take long. There is a huge variety of game types, and some can be a bit challenging, but they are quick to complete. The longest one I have played so far took about 15 minutes to win,  but it was a version of sudoku,  and that naturally takes a while to play. Many take less than one minute. So far,  I have seen no card games,  although I am only about 20 games into it. Defititely not bad for a free download and a nice change from standard gaming.
B005OZE9SA|5|proper sound interface!!!!
B008JGSM6G|5|Challenging and fun. A great way to kill time. I highly recommend this game to players of any age. Lot's of FUN.
B000NVIXFK|5|LOVE this band! So glad they are in the R&R HOF!! There is always a RUsh cd in my player and I have several on my ipod at all times!
B0000584V3|5|Opeth is a band that defies neat categorisations. Yes, Mikael ?...kerfeldt has one of the best death metal voices around, but Opeth isn't really death metal. Similarly, Opeth employs lots of intricate arrangements and unexpected breaks, but they are not really prog. And even though the guitars are frequently set to full distortion, they also have lots of very un-metallic moments. However, no matter how one would like to musically categorise \\"Blackwater Park\\", it is still so good it is almost ridiculous; indeed, it is arguably Opeth's best album.     The opener, \\"The leper affinity\\" is a 10+ minute whiplash-inducing moshfest with enormous power and drive, as well as the obligatory creepy lyrics. Album highlight \\"Bleak\\" has the best riff since Slayer's \\"South of Heaven\\" and also serves as a production and arrangement showcase - the middle section features producer Steven Wilson harmonising beautifully with ?...kerfeldt, before his return to full blood-in-the-lungs roaring. \\"Harvest\\" is a beautiful, sweet little acoustic ballad, while \\"The drapery falls\\" ventures back into the territory only Opeth seems able to explore convincingly - the mid-paced semi-acoustic song that gets punctuated by full-blast guitars and vicious snarling. It is, and will remain, an ber-classic. \\"Dirge for November\\" is possibly the album's weakest song, but is still an excellent, slow-paced atmospheric number. \\"The funeral portrait\\" is another highlight, with a Black Sabbath-esque, almost poppy feel to it; while it is a stand-alone great song, it also servees to break up the brooding mood of the album. A quick, clever little instrumental piece (\\"Patterns in the ivy\\") then sets the stage for the apocalyptic closer, \\"Blackwater Park\\" itself. Combining almost impossibly intricate arrangements with visceral intensity and immense power, it is a mega-classic in its own right.     \\"Blacwater Park\\" represents someting of a pinnacle of musical achievement (big words, but fully warranted). It is as ragingly mosh-friendly as \\"My arms, your hearse\\", as cool and sophisticated as \\"Morningrise\\" and \\"Stil life\\" and as punishingly heavy as \\"Deliverance\\" - not to mention beautifully produced and performed; even the cover art is great. Head and shoulders above anything released the last ten years, and on my shortlist of best albums ever.
B00P5968FC|4|Masterpiece status...minus the ending. If you're looking for legitimate psychological scares this film provides them in spades! It's a shame that the ending (literally the last 15 mins or so) lost the scary edge that made it so unique, opting for heavy handed metaphor in a conclusion that I personally found dissatisfying. However, the acting, cinematography and atmosphere were so consistently brilliant that I can't &#34;knock&#34; the film altogether. Still a very worthwhile watch, some may even appreciate the conclusion was getting at. 9/10*
B00D3J2QKW|5|It gives very good and practical insights on how we could better manage our life. The best part that I like most is the use of the concepts such as &#34;Time block&#34; in daily life.
B00IUBM8PQ|5|CAN'T WAIT FOR THE NEXT ONE
0345803485|4|This book made me a little weak in the knees.  I was a little shy about reading it in public.  But, overall, it was very well written and I could not put it down.
B0054LJGWS|5|Absolutely hilarious, and it will give you a lot to think about. Everything anyone ever believed about anything has been worked into the story. It doesn't matter if that belief is profound or profoundly silly, it's in this book. Unforgettable characters, hilarious situations, and witty dialogue. If you enjoyed the movie Life of Brian, this is like that cranked up to 11. It doesn't insult anyone's religious beliefs, but it does have fun with them. To tell you more would be wrong.<br /><br />If you're only going to read one book about the End of Days, this, not Left Behind, should be that book. If you're only going to read two books about the End Of Days, read this one twice!
B005ZOBNOI|5|The Fault in Our Stars teaches so many lessons and is an amazing book. It is based off a true story so its very pure. It is not a book about cancer, or about a healthy kid feeling bad for a child with cancer. It is not a happy book, but thats what makes it so intriguing. It's the saddest/best book you can read. I recommend it from teens up.
B00AN1G3WA|2|This is truly a mediocre ensemble effort. The arrangements seem to echo one cliche after another. It is a strange mixture of old big band charts and bad disco background structures. It certainly suggests a giant step backward for ensemble jazz. The soloing is a slight relief from the pomp and repetition of the band. When I first listened, I couldn't believe that the arrangers had ever even heard Michael Jackson's music. It has more in common with the terrible soundtrack recordings from 70s youth exploitation films. I played it again today and couldn't make it through any of the tracks. It is rather surprising that the music of a seminal artist could inspire something so unlistenable. I give it one star for Rava who deserves better and one star for ECM who rarely disappoints on this scale.
B005IQZB14|5|I chose this book because I met a young man who just finished walking the PCT. I had so many questions. He suggested that I read this book. He said, like Cheryl, he found himself on the trail. Her fortitude , courage and strength give you the ability to forgive and trust yourself.  You become transformed with every steps she walks.  Great read for anyone stuck or wishing to leap forward in their life.
B008Y7ED5O|5|its a great movie!

B000HKDBXG|5|Es la continuaci&oacute;n, quiz&aacute;s m&aacute;s elaborada de su antecesor. Si bien no hay exitos como Take Your Mama hay canciones que reparten la misma potencialidad en el resto de los temas. La imagen ludica vista en los &uacute;ltimos festivales europeos demuestran que las hermanas tijeras tienen cuerda para rato. El disco es solido y con muy buena instrumentaci&oacute;n, las letras siguen en la linea anterior demostrando que es totalmente compatible la entretenci&oacute;n con la excelente m'suica.<br /><br />Atentos con el tema Paul Mc.<br /><br />Ninguna posibilidad de sentir que van a perder el dinero.

B0084670FU|3|this was a good story that has many intertwining story lines. A little bit of jumping around but it all comes together in the end.
0345409671|3|First the good then the bad - This book was difficult to put down after chapter 10. I come from a religious background and believe in God and the devil but abandoned organized religion. Many of Memnoch's feelings about  God's relationship to humanity (aloof indifference) and Christianity  reflect my feelings at times (and I'm quite sure many others). This is what  drew me in and kept me captivated. I found the spin on the devil to be very  ambitious and creative (though a bit farfetched). Also, Rice's historical  depiction was very accurate down to the details of Roman crucifixion.   <br />However on the flipside, the first 9 chapters were a complete bore and  waste of 200 pages. Roger, Dora and Willie were totally uninteresting  characters. The scene where Lestat fed off Dora was very graphic and  unnecessary. Also, what was the significance of Lestat feeding off Christ?  Why kill Armand (he was my favorite character)? Finally, I was left  wondering, what did Memnoch mean when he said &quot;My thanks to you for a  job perfectly done&quot;? Is this because Lestat loved him and hated God? I  wonder if Memnoch's story was a bunch of lies (just like Lestat). Maybe,  this mystery was Rice's purpose but it's frustrating just the same.<br />Next  read is The Vampire Armand - I sure hope Rice resurrects him somehow.

B006RXQ3GO|4|Pretty Woman is a romcom that tells the story of a down-on-her-luck prostitute,Vivian who is hired by a wealthy businessman, Edward to be his escort for several business and social functions that developed into a fairy tale romance. This Cinderella-like story catapulted Julia Roberts into becoming a Hollywood icon. Her performance made it a memorable film that it still is after more than twenty years since it was released in the theaters despite the fact that it will always be modern fairy tale story-wise.Aside from Roberts and the entertainment it provided the viewer,the film also had a lot of hit songs that it had a memorable soundtrack.
B0013FNC38|4|Didn't really know what to expect since I've only heard a couple of old songs on the radio. This has a couple of catchy songs and the rest is growing on me and some of the lyrics are pretty funny.
B0026772N8|5|5.0 out of 5 stars Just Finish It, November 13, 2014  By Hawk - See all my reviews    This review is from: Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance (Kindle Edition)  Okay, so I'm not a philosophy major and I'm not a great literature critic. You should read this book even if it is the only book you ever finish. I'll admit it is one of the most difficult books I've ever read. However, it is one of the only books I've read multiple times. I was forced to read it for a 100 level Philosophy course in college in the year of 1979. I hated it, but I dutifully read it for the lesson plan. It stuck with me in my subconscious. The story kept popping up in my mind and I kept following the lessons. In my early career days, I followed the advice to take pride in the \\"quality\\" of my work. I wanted to do my job good, not just to get by and get home, but to be really good at my job. I read this book again when I was in my late 30s and my kids were about Chris's age. Again, I had to persevere to finish the book. I got a lot more from it. I wanted to explain myself better to my children than the narrator explained himself to his son Chris in the book. I accomplished this as well. My children understand me and I understand them. We are very close and as a result there were never any secrets and we all get along very well. I just read it again in my mid 50s. I still had to endeavor to finish it. Maybe I have a slight advantage because I have been riding and working on motorcycles for 45 years. However, this book will teach you different meanings of life at every stage of your life. I now get the philosophical lessons about understanding how to blend the classic and romantic perceptions for a better quality of life. My favorite passage from this book is; \\"The real cycle you're working on is a cycle called yourself. The machine that appears to be \\"out there\\" and the person that appears to be \\"in here\\" are not two separate things. They grow toward Quality or fall away from Quality together\\". I talk to so many people who said they tried to read it and have given up a quarter to half way into it. That's kind of ironic isn't it? Read the book, finish the book, try to understand some of it. Read it again later and see how much more you understand. I plan to put it on my bucket list to read it again and see what I get from it next time !!!
B00005JPLW|5|Fantastic \\"blue background\\" cinema-- taking real actors and making them inhabit \\"bodies to die for\\". Lots of fantastic action scenes; basically true to what really did happen, as far as historians can be sure, and visually stunning.  The movie's success laid the background for \\"Beowulf\\", now in theatres.  Great fun!
B000059ZLH|3|First off I want to say that I love Dream Theater and they are perhaps some of the best musicians that have ever walked the face of the planet, but this DVD leaves a little to be desired. First off, NO SOLOS!! Why? The whole resaon I bought this DVD was to see a Mike Portnoy drum solo. The second thing I did not like was the very low budget independent film [stuff] between all the songs, what is that?? It's like listening to a Dream Theater CD during [bad] movie night on the Sundance Channel. Another thing that disturbed me was that it seemed like what you see is what is played on the giant monitor at the concerts, goofy effects and other things. A must have for die-hard fans but casual non-musician fans stay away.
B00AAQRNQ8|5|I needed a new mouse for for gaming so i looked at some reviews and this is the best one i could find for my price range I got it and it amazing I love it its so fast and i like the design it super cool and i like how you put the weights in to your game style
B00HB77QA2|5|Great album.  I bought this for myself as it reminding me of listening to The Kinks, Zombies etc. with my dad in his car when I was little.  I also bought this for my dad and he loved it! I think it brought him back to memory lane, but still had the excitement of new music, as each song is very well written and unique without being a rip off or a cover artist.
B007AL48UK|3|good
0385504225|5|Great writing!  I loved it.  I didn't think he could top THE DA VINCI CODE, but he has.  Unfortunately, it seems that many people are missing the point.  This is fiction layered onto fact!  And what a wonderful job Dan Brown has done.  The architecture of Washington, D. C., the art work, the basic premises of the Masons . . . have all been so well researched that everything he has created here is plausible--even though it's FICTION.  Readers need to remember this.  As he did with THE DA VINCI CODE, he tells us at the beginning what is fact, expecting us to know that out of fact he has created fiction.    From the first page to the last I loved it.  Even after the climax and resolution of what might be perceived as the main plot, I was still in thrall, right down to the last word. I am already anticipating his next novel.
B009O5CLZY|5|I play this game a lot... whenever im bored it is really easy to play once you get the hang of it. I love hows much you are able to improve after you begin. Great game worth 99 cents...

B007XNAOPI|5|I love old Baroness, and when I heard that they said their next album would be different and more relaxed I was wondering what we were in for. It's great.  I don't know how to explain it, but its still heavy, but its got more groove than if ever imagine. The songs are well written and try transition well.
B000JLTRJ0|1|love the movie,<br />had seen it once before,<br />but when i got the dvd in the mail, the feature film disc was scratched so badly it was to the point where i couldn't even watch it,<br />this was right out of the box,<br />and this isn't the first time i've had issues with this sort of thing!

B00E8KLWB4|5|I love this game. It makes you pay attention. It's good for filling up time. Always play before bedtime. It works my mind.
B00ISJO1D2|4|This was an  interesting read, a serial killer who is also a psychic? Cant say that I've read anything like this before. It was a very fast and gripping read.<br /> I really liked Emily. Even though she is a bit naïve, she has a good heart and only wants to help people. I can see this being a great series with her leading cases trying to help people using her &#34;gifts&#34; even if she doesn't tell people about them.<br /> Her best friend and partner Cassie annoyed me at times. She is a grown woman who used to be a police officer but she always seemed to be too interested in dating than doing really anything else. But overall I liked all of the characters. At times the story dragged a bit with developing them.<br /> I loved the concept that real psychics can only connect with the living because dead is dead. I found that very unique. Also the idea of people being conduits. Which is a big part of the story.<br /> This made for a thrilling read with a bit of paranormal thrown in. I definitely look forward to reading more in the series.
B008EL25LE|5|I really like this kind of game. It's a match game but a little different. You don't move the object, you slide your finger over the ones that are the same and connect together. Then there is other &#34;games&#34; within &#34;games&#34;.  Recommend for anyone.
0143038583|5|Let me put it out front -- I'm an omnivore and nothing in the book changes that.  What has changed is my entire way of looking at food.  The book is loaded with information that makes one reconsider the mix of foods you eat.  What I like is that it does this while not telling the reader precisely what foods to eat and what foods to avoid.  Rather, the emphasis is on balance and on knowing something about where your food comes from.  This is a subject for which too many authors become preachy, but not Pollan.
0553386794|5|This was a gift for my boyfriend it was in excellent condition and actually bigger than I thought it would be. Prompt shipping.

B00000HZHS|4|A lot of people i knew enjoyed a lot of the songs on this album,and my best friend and the girl i like both liked this album a lot,so i figured it must be pretty good.So,when i was on vacation in Florida,i saw a used copy of the CD and decided,what the heck?It was only 5.99,so it wasn't much,even if i disliked it. <br /> <br />First of all,this album is A LOT to listen to.Yes,it is only 12 tracks,but you can't get the full benefit of this album with only one or two listens.There are no pop radio anthems like \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" or \\"Lithium\\" on this album,and it's like that for a reason.The group wanted to change there sound,because they had hated what they became.This change,in turn,was 'In Utero'.It opens with a bang with the excellent \\"Serve The Servants\\",which has several ironic lines in the beginning(teenage angst has paid off well).Following it was \\"Scentless Apprentice\\",a song with riffs that were completely different from anything heard on nevermind,but had excellent harmony.But it had Cobain screaming 'get away' in the chorus,just screaming.\\"Heart Shaped Box\\" was an excellent song,even with it's eerie bass line,Cobain helps with his lyrics that surely signify something great.\\"Waif Me\\" was originally titled \\"Rape Me\\",and is one of the BEST songs on the album,but one of the least credited.\\"Frances Farmers Will Have Her Revenge On Seattle\\" is the only song on the album that will even sound remotly similar to anything heard on 'Nevermind'.\\"Dumb\\" is another song that broke the mold of there normal sound,bringing in a full set of strings to back the band up.\\"Very Ape\\" and \\"Milk It\\" are two more good songs on this album,with fast rythms and twisting lyrics.\\"Pennyroyal Tea\\" is one of my personal favorites,due to the slow speed but intense lyrics and guitar riffs.\\"Radio Friendly Unit Shifter\\" is ok,but due to the long static interruption in the beginning,it makes it my least favored track.\\"Tourettes\\" is the closest Nirvana could drift,in my opinion,from the 'Nevermind' sound.The song has Cobain screaming fictional words over guitars that match some light Nu Metal in modern music.Finally,it all closes with \\"All Apoligies\\".It's soft harmony but sludgy guitars make it an excellent song,but it does sound better acoustically. <br /> <br />'In Utero' is one of the most radical concept albums of the 90's,and Nirvana should be credited for it's attempt at something new.But this desire to produce a new sound did leave a gap between the 'Nevermind' fans and the fans who enjoyed 'In Utero' more.The songs on this album are harder,and more intense,just as Cobain's life had become.Where as Nevermind,it just showed a glossy punk record with an alternative lean.So,you must pick which you want to go with.If you are a real fan of Nevermind,you might not like this.If you leaned towards Incesticide or Bleach instead of Nevermind,this album is more for you. <br /> <br />
B004Q7CIFI|5|Steven King at his best.
B005ERIRZE|5|Kelly provides insights into willpower backed by research and ways to apply them that are effective, realistic for real people and sympathetic - with a touch of wit that I enjoy. This is a self-development winner for me.

B000N3ST8O|5|An excellent compilation of the greatest hits.  If your a \\"new\\" fan looking to hear some of the more popular songs from this artist--here's a one-stop shop!  Great sound quality on the \\"live\\" songs.
B00003CY5H|3|Edward Norton's sensational performance which has him masquerading as a mentally challenegd janitor in order to pull off a robbery makes what could have been just another &quot;heist&quot; movie into one of the coolest movies this year to date...<br />Robert De Niro, looking bored and slightly dissapated, sleepwalks his way through another role...what happened to the actor who gave us Travis Bickle, Runpert Pupkin and Jake La Motta?<br />How's Brando?<br />As big as a house but he can still act rings around the world!<br />Edward Norton is what De Niro was 20 years ago!
B003TSEEDY|5|I'm speechless, this book was downright amazing. You will love it. This is a MUST read! Absolutely Amazing.<br /><br />Love Always,<br />Mackenzie
B0001N9ZKW|5|In our age of hyped-up folkrock artists like Ryan Adams and Bright Eyes, it is a real eye-opener to listen to this album. The music lingers in the borderland between traditional english and american music, giving it a really original flavour.  <br /> <br />The opener, the transcendent \\"When I get to the border\\" is probably the best \\"new\\"(to me) song I`ve heard so far this year, totally unpretentious and original and free. Like Bob Dylan, Richard Thompson attempts & fails to conceal an amazing personality and individuality which seeps through every breath of his vocal work. The same goes for the rest of the album.  <br /> <br />Linda`s vocals are a little less original, but more than adequate compared to other singers, and anyway, the imperfections of this album adds up to become perfection as a whole.The title song, for example: A rambunctious, messy, drunken, glorious thing, complete with a marching band and a primitive bassline, totally irresistible. If you`ve heard \\"The basement tapes\\", you`ll know what I mean.  <br /> <br />Strongly recommended.
B000YHG72E|5|Such a great modern Christmas story.<br />Super Family and small child friendly for its lack of darkness and evil,<br />its heart warming story and humor...
B00J3V97NS|5|Absolutely beautiful, I've had this CD on repeat in my car and at work since I bought it.  Shatter Me, Roundtable Rival, and Night Vision are my three favorite tracks but the whole album is fantastic.  Love Lindsey Stirling!!!
B006LSZECO|4|Once you start reading it you can't put it down. Hard to comment without spoiling the story
B000SZK41M|4|The 'Die Hard' series almost seems like it is getting out of hand with ridiculous action scenes, but the original here to me is the best.  Alan Rickman does a great job playing the sinister foe and even does a pretty funny impersonation in the movie.  Great 80's movie for anyone wanting to be entertained!
B006MW3UZW|5|Loved catching up on Downton Abbey by watching it on Amazon Prime.  So convenient.  Can't wait to watch Season 3.

B00B2V66VS|5|This is just simply an amazing game. My score is over 9,500,000 , and I did it without cheating. :)
B00F3VOL38|4|Nice, but doesn't have the &#34;newness&#34; of the first set at the BBC.  They really ought to put out the tunes used in &#34;Pop Go The Beatles&#34; series they shut down.  I was lucky enough to get a legal set of those programs and they're outstanding.  A few of those tunes have ended up on the Volume 2 disks.  For your pleasure.<br /><br />I wonder if Capital will ever produce the 3rd set of their Beatles albums?  There's still plenty of gold to mine in the Beatles recordings.  This isn't the end, but rather mid-stream in the Ono-McCartney-Starkey productions.
B00EHMFC78|3|I read the previous Will Robie stories and found this one to be the most gory. Baldacci is good at character development and in the case of the evil characters in this book, a little too good. The bad guys got what they deserved, but I wanted to take a mind shower after reading the parts that developed their characters. I skimmed a lot of it after a while. The ending was great though.
B00785P2QC|4|its a good game for killing time i really like it. But you should not be able to run out of energy. I think that is kind of stupid.
B00004T8RK|5|Typical of many Pearl Jam albums, &quot;Binaural&quot; opens at breakneck  pace with &quot;Breakerfall&quot; and the awesome &quot;Gods' Dice,&quot;  an especially rousing rocker.  Both of these short songs are vintage Pearl  Jam, nothing flashy or glamorous, not at all fluffed-up or polished for  recording purposes.  And that's the way people like these guys.  &quot;Evacuation&quot; sounds a little unadventurous, generic, and cyclical  from past Pearl Jam albums, but that's the only one.  The rest of these  songs are uniquely their own identity.<br />What's most significant about  &quot;Binaural&quot; is the way it tends to focus on the quiet sounds this  band can produce, as if they collectively decided to put on the speedbrakes  a little bit.  &quot;Light Years&quot; is practically dinner music compared  to most Pearl Jam tunes, while &quot;Nothing as it Seems&quot; is as mellow  as it gets, yet a very worthy song.  All that trippy background guitar  noise gets addictive after awhile.  &quot;Thin Air&quot; has a light sound  in the same vain as &quot;Light Years,&quot; and is actually an even better  song, though some might find the lyrics a tad lovey-dovey for Pearl Jam.<br />Looking at the credit lists within this album, it's as if the guys  simply stood back and took turns writing songs for the album, which is a  splendid and often difficult way to operate.  Though Vedder had a hand in  writing most of the songs, especially all lyrics, his bandmates truly  stepped up again to contribute, especially Jeff Ament.  Other great rockers  are &quot;Insignificance&quot; and the purposely racous  &quot;Grievance,&quot; where Vedder vents to &quot;pledge his grievance to  the flag&quot; wholeheartedly.  Other than that, &quot;Rival&quot; is a  wonderful mid-tempo rhymic groove of a song, while the rest of the tunes  boast an atmospheric, slower-tempo vibe.  &quot;Of the Girl&quot; has a  vaguely Led Zepplenish sheen to it, a gorgeous acoustic tune backed by soft  electric guitar, creating a sparkling, very memorable melody.  Songs like  this prove that Pearl Jam are starting to sound as good on their slower,  quieter material as they are on their louder, more mosh pit oriented tunes,  which some have said have run their course.  (Not me!!).<br />&quot;Sleight of  Hand&quot; is one of those Pearl Jam songs that will tear you up, a  lyrically observant song about the passage and wasting of time, a song that  wonders how we get where we currently are, through the eyes of one soul.  It may just be the best song these guys have written, and that says a whole  bunch.  &quot;Soon Forget&quot; is a quircky, quiet Eddie Vedder penned  song with just he and a ukelele, plus an excellent message everyone should  heed.  Finally, &quot;Parting Ways&quot; ends a little eerily, a little  familiarly, and somewhat dramatically.  The title about sums it up.  This  is simply an outstanding record, one that most won't remember as being  their Pearl Jam favorite.  What &quot;Binaural&quot; lacks in terms of  foregoing one standout single, it more than makes up for in terms of a  great collection of thirteen songs, a mood, a vibe and feeling that Pearl  Jam have so perfected over the years.electric guitar, creating a sparkling, very memorable melody.

B007MG360G|3|Kinda hard But My kids and Grand kids really enjoy playing the game..It Keeps them happy therefore 3 Stars. OK game
B001SMC91M|4|Great album and lots of fun -- fits nicely into the neo-soul/ Motown revival movement that has become marginally popular of late.  If you like Eli \\"Paperboy\\" Reed or the Dynamites or Sharon Jones and the Dap Kings, you'll probably also like Black Joe Lewis and the Honeybears.  This one brings a bit more of a blues influence than those similar artists, however.  All in all, I definitely recommend it!
B0042TV4IW|4|I love this series and can't wait for new season to start ......if it does. I watched this while waiting on Downton Abbey to return and was pleasantly surprised. Good actors with historical perspectives of the times. Strong female leads. Good entertainment

B000P0J0AG|5|Life is the smooth, white lines that circle around and around, leading us as we go, but some walk their own way. Waves of drama mix with cool suspense, an aroma of mystery that begs us to taste, to know the one sitting before us. All that we desire is cupped by a hand that could pull us into heart or break us with revenge. We can't turn away from hero or foe, and the room falls under hush, waiting for them to converse. Their words will never fade but forever be savored as legend, and we cling to tendrils of smoke drifting over story's end, hungry to know each and every character and hungry to know what fate has planned. We can't break free. We are mesmerized by pools of determination, sparks of intensity, and we drown deep beneath the brown, murky waves. All that we are, all that we ever will be lies hand in hand with the journey of two men, twisting along the fires of their lives that will always engulf us as we drink deeply.
B000FS9FCQ|4|The movie had a slightly different plot than the original graphic novel but i think it worked out very well. I think that they should have filled in some of the \\"missing links\\" that could have been taken from the book (for example, more detail on the testing done at Larkhill, and how V escaped..ect). I also thought they did a great job portraying and using the chancellor, in the novel he wasn't nearly as involved. over all it is a very good movie, it sends a very powerful message.
B007J4T2G8|3|the subject matter was very interesting, but the extremely grafic sex wasn't necessary and became distracting.  it was well written and gave insight into the disturbed mind of a dominant and an abused woman.
B00I6IKSZ0|3|I personally do not have anything to do with it but my grandchildren seam to really like it
B006QVRUS2|2|this film has one theme:  children are probably more civilized than their parents.  That's it.  It is not explored, it is only shown through multiple examples of lightly escalatingly crappy behavior as 2 sets of parents argue with eachother.  Certain elements of the film seem to be comic in nature  (puking, using the bathroom, making fun of Jodi Foster, Jodi Foster getting really mad, Jodi Foster being a lousy cook, John C Reilly being goofy), but instantly wear thin because there's no irony to give the quasi-funny stuff any sort of contrast.<br /><br />I like movies where characters clash verbally.  I love Doubt, Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, Dangerous Liasons, etc.  But those films are about revealing something other than ridiculousness and pettiness.  I love Roman Polanski, but this feels like the most phoned-in work he's done.<br /><br />Maybe the film loses something in being translated for a foreign language and from being a play.  Maybe it's meant to be strictly existential in outlook.  Maybe it's meant to be unengaging.<br /><br />If that's true, then it's a success.  But I can't recommend it.
B008JFUTT0|5|What a wonderful experience this movie is.  It's for anyone who was ever moved by any type of music.  it's beautifully done, you go thru so many emotions while watching it and tho I don't collect DVD's, I will get this one.  Its's an amazing story.....

0547396945|5|This book is another Mem Fox classic, in my opinion.  There is something always soothing about her choice of words and the rhythm in which they flow.  My daughters are big fans and so am I.
B0046ECFRM|5|read this bc it was suggested by my favorite YA author John Green. I finished it in a day, I didn't want the story to end. Anna was totally relatable even though she was in an extraordinary setting. Every girl will fall for St.Clair. I can't wait to see what comes next from Stephanie Perkins
B00FCQQ1IW|5|This whole series by J. Archer has been wonderful. He spins an engaging narrative while teaching a history lesson. Although he is a little long winded at times I enjoy these books immensely.
0060245867|5|I bought this book for my son when he was 2 1/2 years old and he's loved it ever since.  The drawings are very well done and the story is charming and care free - my son knows all the words without reading.  Although the recommended age range for this series is 4-8, I find it an appropriate story for children 2 1/2 and up as long as they refrain from tearing apart the pages!  I just ordered two more of the series for Christmas presents.  A great book!
B006ZWLXZ8|4|The bombastic production (I say that with love) comes through much clearer on vinyl. The strings in &#34;Video Games&#34; nearly brought me to tears. I regret hating on this album for the first year it was out; after sitting with it a few times, I realize how wrong I was.
158234082X|4|In this funny book you get an extraordinary look into what really goes on in the professional kitchens around USA, mostly New York. The author is the present chef of the New York-restaurant Les Halles, and he tells you everything. From his beginning in humble and small restaurants and caf&eacute;s to the present day as chef in a famous restaurant. There are gross details in this book, making you think twice about ever eating out again, and sometimes it is hard to believe that this is the truth. Does the fine and elegant food really come from the hands of tattooed and dirty scumbags, fighting and drinking out back or does the author exaggerate a bit here and there? I don't know, but the book and the writing definitely has an honest feel to it, and it is possible that is really is like this. We follow the chef's ups and downs through his cooking and private life, but mostly through his cooking life. We learn about what it is like to work in a greasy caf&eacute; as well as in a huge establishment, and we also get a good look into the business side of running a restaurant as well as some great tips, like not ordering fish in a restaurant during the weekend, and I am also thinking twice about the whole brunch-concept after having read the book, brunch being a mix of a whole week's leftovers. The book is well written, and the language is never too much, even though it may seem brutal and brutally honest in some passages.
B004EQAVHI|5|I can't get enough of this movie. The books are really good as well. The story is beautiful, sad, romantic, realistic, futuristic. It's everything you are looking for out of a movie. Excellent casting.
1932100660|5|\\"Startling Implications\\" indeed...and hard to argue with. Compelling. It caused me to re-think my diet. And I'm not a fad-follower. Smart science backing up what some people consider to be common sense.
1419705644|5|This is an amazing book that I have yet to read because Im afraid that The Lich may have put a curse on it and I don't really like curses.
B007BFSYMS|5|Customizable, works well for a very picky white noise addict. The brown noise is my favorite, I have yet to be disappointed.
0374532125|5|The author made a great analysis of the international aid from developed countries to the third world. She points out how and why this pseudo aid is killing instead of helping poor countries.
B000JK8OYU|5|The sound quality of this CD exceeds expectations!  The blend, harmony, and clarity of sound are excellent!
B00JB3AOEY|2|Not my kind of movie..
0385349831|5|I bought this book twice, because my daughter gave it away to her friends.  A good book for someone who is seeking for something in their life.  Would make a good gift to a graduate, or for someone who is in the process of life change.  Read it, pass it on.  I will make a difference wherever it lands.
B00BVYNSLC|5|Excellent
1476770387|3|This book has some beautifully written parts, but I don't feel that the beginning, middle and end are cohesive. It's so very disjointed. I'm a big fan of Mr King, this is just one I didn't care for.
B00000JGEI|5|For some people, this might be kind of hard to understand but the original is a better movie, but I enjoy this one more. The first one is better quality, with a fresher plot, but from a guy's point of view, it has more action, and possibly better special effects than the Matrix. I reccomend renting this movie first, because if your reading these reviews, you've obviously never seen it.
B0084AZXKK|5|It's been quite a while since I've read this book, but certainly did not disappoint.  It won't be long until the movie will be remade!
B00004SVID|4|Cds were in great condition, no scratches, could pass for brand new!!
B0063IH60K|5|Your usual version of Solitaire....all computers and electronic devices should have a copy of this game.  Add it to your list of games.
B0064MPXFA|2|Not as dense as I would like (think of Damages, Boss).  Cookie cutter plots, vapid acting.
B00DURILJ2|5|Poignant, yet, action packed.  Coming of age story, love story, and a commentary on how life, love, and the law changes all of us.  The young boy Ellis, does a fantastic job, and his sincerity, idealism, and loyalty are extremely moving.  Well worth the watch.
B00794ML3Y|5|fascinating
B00AOCLWF6|5|Great show
B008XG1X18|4|I use this on my kindle fire. I love the app! I love how easy it is to use... however it freezes all the time and gives me the option to &quot;force close&quot; or &quot;wait&quot;... if you click wait its fine... needs an update to fix that issue. other than that I am a Pinterest junior!
B001D0DQUC|5|My favorite!
B000E6UK5K|5|Because they don't get the fact that David Gilmour is doing what he wants to do, which is reflecting back on his life; and won't we all someday? <br />This is an extremely enjoyable CD, and it is supposed to sound like Pink Floyd, because he really is the sound, for the most part; of Pink Floyd. <br />He reports that there is maybe upto 150 songs in the 'vault',some of which might be considered for release, so he is not breathing his \\"last breath\\", as some might think. <br />Carry on, David.
B00DJFIMW6|5|I love this game because it's just like subway surfers, but<br />Has to do with a despicable me minion running so he can<br />can be minion of the year.
B000FS9FCG|4|I really like this film!<br />Natalie Portman's acting is so very good.<br />About an England where a neo-Nazi has come to power;<br />the use of fear in the classic sense has made a police state<br />possible: it reminds one very much of the current Bush administration<br />where 'security' overrides rights.<br />The prisoner/ experimental subject in cell V in an biological<br />concentration camp right out Germany at the end of WWII survives.<br />Like the X-man magneto he has abilities beyond the ordinary,<br />like seeing without eyes and strength.<br />The rescue of the young Evie changes him, but not his plan<br />to overthrow the government on Guy Fawkes Day.
B009UX2YAC|5|This game is awesome. It looks like temple run but the part is that the characters cost a lot of coins and unlock the treasure of the characters and Jake go's straight ahead. This game never ends and it really gets hard when it gets all the way
B004FDPOHC|5|Love this CD it is great music Daft punk made a great soundtrack to a really good movie I'm glad I purchased it
B00004C8TC|5|These two romantic concertos are grandly dramatic exemplars of that era.  The playing on this CD appropriately communicates that drama in crystal clear sound.  I have heard the Schumann in several versions and consider this the best of the lot.  Recommended without reservations.
B000QRIGLC|5|Very good book!! Would recommend.
B00AE6SS5O|3|The story is slow but the games are interesting and fun and the game graphics are very life like! Fun game.
B004GHNIRK|4|You could watch this and really understand the feeling and drive of each and every character, or you could sit with others and try to watch it in a theater or opera house and listen to fans sing along like 5 year olds at a Wiggles concert.
B00E3IZIM0|5|This movie is not about story, character development, or romance (although it attempts to have all of those). ITS ABOUT GIANT ROBOTS BATTLING GIANT MONSTERS! Guillermo del Toro has outdone himself with both eye candy and a captivating script. Sure, even the plot itself is far-fetched, but extremely entertaining! Bring on the sequel!!!
B009UNGYHG|5|Love this charger.  I'm busy in the field for work.  I carry this with me charging it at night.  Anytime I'm in the field with down time on the phone, I put my headset into this cradle and it charges it....twice a day!  Very Happy with the procduct
B000I186FW|5|very smart movie every american should see . the government should be afraid of the people i could what it again and again
B000TFINY6|5|While at first glance, this may seem a bit pricey, let me assure you, it is completely worth it.  The experience of BLu-Ray for the wonderful show LOST is truly amazing.      Plus, Season 3 of LOST was fantastic.
B00B7Y0206|1|I hate this app.  It's very slow, takes 30 min. to watch a 6 min. video.  My keyboard kindle runs tv and movies without stopping at all.  This app stops every 3 seconds to load the video.  It's horrible.
B00CDT41RY|5|QT knocks another one out of the park.  Don't listen to the critics...there was just enough &#34;N-Word&#34; and violence.  Foxx was OK, but Christoph Waltz was friggin AMAZING!
0684801558|3|The Beautiful and Damned is a Naturalist novel that recounts the slow dissolution of Anthony Patch, heir to a large fortune, and his charmingly immature, hedonistic, and impulsive wife Gloria.<br />There's something a little &quot;off&quot; in this novel--even saying the title out loud requires an odd caesura. The plot has a feeling of artificial inevitability. Early on, it's easy to sympathize with Patch, even to root for him, but at times his thought processes and actions are so maudlin that one wants him to just *fall* already. Gloria is a fine and interesting character, but by and large the peripheral characters are closer to caricatures.<br />The book's strength is its prose, natural and authoritative, never self-consciously clever to an annoying extent. Fitzgerald's pacing is steady; occasional meandering narrative passages are fished quickly out of the water with dialog and plot events.<br />All in all it's a fairly good book, worth a read if you're NOT looking for the near-great Gatsby.
B00JVZ0DQG|5|too addicting
0061998494|5|Easy read, funny, thoughtful, self effacing, tender and hard to put down. I admire this man and would be proud if he was my brother. I want to get the other book he wrote.... Hey Santa!
B003CH9PTU|5|If you haven't watched this series, PLEASE DO!  you will not be disappointed.  I plan on downloading the remaining seasons.<br /><br />One word:  ADDICTING!
B00HN1TEL0|5|This is a clean family movie that gives everyone a good feeling about being alive. Many of the movies being released lack any real moral value and certainly don't build your faith in humanity and things to come. I love the actors. I have used this story teaching personal integrity and values. I love this country and all that it can be. Watch this movie and you will have a little more hope in the future and what it can be.
B00BC5I6Q2|2|\\"House of Cards\\" began as a trilogy of novels by Michael Dobbs, which is the best version. BBC turned it into a miniseries starring Ian Richardson, which is excellent. This American version just turns it into ordinary TV with a nasty protagonist and lots of sex and violence. Francis Urquhart (initials not incidentally \\"FU\\") is a villain, but as Dobbs wrote him and Richardson played him, he calls Shakespeare's Richard III to mind, a villain thoroughly enjoying his villany and including the audience in the fun. As played by Kevin Spacey, renamed Frank Underwood, he is just a despicable man.
B00KA87GCW|3|It's ok, not great
B006ON41FC|5|the entire family will love this game (my 5 and 10 yr old love it) it is very entertaining. my husband and I both are addicted. very challenging.
B00COGZ8FU|3|Fell asleep watching it..... Yawn
B004IFYMYI|5|The Martin Scorsese classic is gorgeous in 1080p hi-def. A must own for any film buff. Deniro is brilliant. Five stars.
B008ROVTEW|5|Grandson enjoyed it.
B001FB4W02|5|I like it
B00L7PJE4A|1|practically useless.
B000MR9D5E|5|This video series is excellent. Our entire family has enjoyed watching.  Our children ages 20,16,12,& 8 all really liked these videos.  The video photography is amazing.  I especially enjoy the \\"Planet Earth diaries\\" at the end of each video.  The diaries help the viewer understand the logistics and painstaking effort involved in filming these scenes.  Each disk is made up of 4-5 videos, each about 1 hour long, so you can choose to watch one topic or more as your time permits.  The topics are broken down into areas such as:  caves, mountians, deep seas, shallow seas, ice world, jungles, etc.
B00BHUB11Y|5|2 year old adores this movie. Don't be dissuaded by the title monsters- very accessible and not scary for the wee ones.
B00881VLCE|4|I love jigsaw puzzles and I couldn't find any that were really challenging and fun until I found this app!! Oh what a treat! Finally puzzles to solve that do not bore me! I have only solved a few so far and have enjoyed doing it.
B004DLPXAO|5|love this app. you can download this on any device and read whatever you have across all your devices. One of the best apps I have.
B000XUBFE2|5|The book was slightly difficult to get started. I put it down once and restarted at a later date. Once I understood the concept of the narrator, I was hooked.
B0040QYROK|5|As Roger Ebert once said, \\"Metropolis\\" is a \\"...mistreated masterpiece...\\" and I could not agree more. Before this edition of \\"Metropolis, all other versions were incoherent and were missing many scenes that were once thought lost. However, in 2008, they discovered something truly special. They founf a 16mm print of a near complete version of \\"Metropolis\\"! This print, while has terrible quality, had 25 minutes of once missing scenes that were crucial to story, such as Freder taking the place of the worker, 11811, more scenes of the robotic-like Thin Man, and at last, why Rotwang has such hatred for Frederson. The missing scenes, along with the 2001 print, combined to create the ultimate \\"Metropolis\\" experience! A newly recorded version of the original score by Godfried Huppertz has been added especially for this edition. The score is nothing less than astounding, and helps carry the power of Lang's visuals. With too many highlights to name, \\"The Complete Metropolis\\" is truly one of the greatest cinematic acheivements ever, one of my favorite films.
B004J4WKUQ|5|amazing book! It's totally worth reading even if you dont normally read sci-fi.
B000002KET|5|If you love heavy riffs and great drumming there is no way you can't love this album.  SBS has it all....killer guitar, jazzy drums, and cool Wakeman piano.....people often overlook how great each player was in this band.  Turn Sabra Cadabra up to MAX volume and feel the chills as the bass kicks in to that awesome guitar riff.....Billy Ward banging away with cool fills.....and it's a love song WTF?  A couple of duds I could do without like Fluff and Who are You?  But the rest rock.....SBS, National Acrobat, KYTL, and Looking for Today all rock out.  Tough to be heavy and melodic but they hit it here.  Cheers!
B005BRS8Z6|5|Thank you so much for this book.  I will try each day to achieve the 4 agreements. with Love & appreciation!!
B00KK0PICK|5|It's rare to read a book and be so inspired by the instant results that you start recommending it to others before you even finished, but this book did that for me.<br /><br />At nearly 35, I don't think I've ever gotten &#34;tyding&#34; right but it has never been as bad as a problem until I moved into a gorgeous Manhattan studio with the goal of inviting friends over more, only to have my constant disorder get in my way from ever doing so. Once my friend had to use the restroom and I was so embarrassed by my piles of mail, clothes and general messiness that I made him wait outside. He was furious!<br /><br />I grew up like this as well with the type of Asian mom who saved everything for fear of being wasteful, and my house was always in chaos no matter how hard my mom cleaned. If people came over it was a huge ordeal to basically clean, which meant tucking things away in random hidden places.  Flash forward many years of being alone, after moving from a more remote part of New York and downgrading size for location, I recently bought a book that talks about the opposite method Marie refers to here, doing one thing at a time, one room at a time hoping to address why I was never able to keep up. 6 months later nothing worked at all. But like many things in this book, Marie uses some common sense and some basic core principles to prove that method wrong (although I think it does have value for cleaning, like dusting/washing type of cleaning, not tidying and organizing like this book discusses). I had to start at the core, and even though I just moved and purged, I didn't do it with the focus that this book provides. Sorting everything by category and purging what doesn't bring you joy and then storing things in ways that respect the items was what was missing. I needed to start from the inside out, all at once to make my lifestyle truly change.<br /><br />The instant results speak for themselves. I was in the market for a media console and now I'm so organized and down to the core items I truly need that I don't even have anything to put inside of it anymore. My closet and dresser space doubled, and now one of my larger closets has become a walk-in because of her methods and principles I was able to apply. It's amazing to walk into that closet and marvel at how easy it is to find every item! And now when I wear a sweater and come home from work, I no longer throw it into a random pile and pass out on the bed, but I file it onto the shelf in the slot that is left for it due to everything being stacked vertically.<br /><br />I actually think the pairing of the common sense methods that nobody sat down to teach you with the core values that may seem a little silly to those unfamiliar with Eastern philosophies and superstitions is what makes this book stick as opposed to others. Things like respecting your hard working socks and not piling them balls, or respecting your items even if that means letting them go, something about that resonated with me and made it more applicable to everything I need to do to get my home in order. All my decisions now are so easy, and now that I know everything in my apartment and how much space I have, my shopping will be that much more purposeful and focused on things I truly love or need.<br /><br />I was so proud of how clean (and proud of my excitement to constantly be more organized) that I told my mom, but yes, she did freak out in horror at the thought of me throwing out everything that doesn't bring you joy. But for me, it absolutely cured that little bit of my mom that kept things for fear of being wasteful or that I might need it later, and I feel so much more centered and excited due to everything Marie has taught me.wn to the core items I truly need that I don't even have anything to put inside of it anymore.

B0064X7FVE|1|This was a wonderful app until the update. Now it wants to tell you everything but the weather. You cannot even read the words that are about the weather on top of the daytime pictures.  Do the developers not use this app either? I have tried to learn to use it, but I just hate it more every time. I am deleting it.
B00IPGGEK6|5|Great comeback!
B002EEP3NO|5|Only worth splurging for the most diligent of lego builders. Sticker sheet was bent, but I called LEGO and they mailed me whatever I needed from Denmark at no cost.
B003VANOFY|2|The sound on these are not that loud. I had downgrade the Logitech Gaming software to a older revision to allow it to boost the sound output. They disabled it in future software due to some European standard crap. If they would allow that feature to come back in the current software for USA i would give it a higher rating.
B004AM5QT4|5|I really enjoyed this one. He is an author who really holds your interest. Reminded me of his many great stories.
B00NWLIW0E|1|Up load it and it does not work
0571137245|5|It should be noted that there is a 1985 PLAY version, not an edition of the French novel (oops). If, like me, you wandered in looking for the novel, wander back out and search under Laclos and get an edition not coauthored by someone named Hampton. That said, it's a good play by a good playwright, and I rather liked the movie made from it. Just be careful about which book you buy, since they all seem to share a common pool of reviews.
B0001GOH6Q|5|Well all i really can say about this movie is in one word...amazing. I saw it in theatres and i just cannot believe how amazing it is. The acting by Ewan McGregor and Albert Finney is just incredible. And of course, Danny Elfman's music is just wondeful just like in every other Burton film.Tim Burton did a great job on Big Fish.
1476712042|4|(really a 4.5 stars) Unless you have a reading pile as long as mines, that can probably wrap around the planet, then you have read or seen the rave reviews for Beautiful Disaster. Jamie McGuire has created a gut wrenching powerhouse of a romance novel. Such intensity within these pages, especially at the end. The title of this book couldn't have been more prefect for the story. How many of us can relate to the title. Some of us have at one point in our lives gone through a phase where yes we are beautiful inside but the path we are leading is disastrous until you yourself or someone helps you snap out of it. Everything about Beautiful Disaster amplifies the title and more, I truly enjoyed it.<br /><br />In this story we follow along Abby, she has transformed herself into goodie Ms. Two Shoes. She even chose to study far away from home, so no one would find out about her dark past and dragged her best friend with her. Everything is working out as planned until she meets and sees Travis, the ultimate hotter than hell bad boy. Abby knows she must resist his charms, unlike any other girl at their college who practically throw themselves at him when he is in their presences. She can't let herself even be friends with someone like him, it would mean bringing up her past. Travis fights on the lowdown to earn extra cash and Abby sees this attitude when she attends one of his secret fights, she is shaken to her core with what she witness. How hard will Abby have to fight to resist Travis. Well when she looses a bet and has to deal with Travis one on one, that wall that she has worked real hard to keep upright, is caving by the second. Thing is though, Abby isn't the only one that is changing. Travis might be losing some of the bad boy in him, seems Travis has finally found his match with Abby. They will either make it through together or let the past directed the future.<br /><br />You might be wondering why I didn't give it the full 5 trees, well Travis's character as much as I did love him, I also hated him at times. His possessiveness drove me insane at times and would even make me take reading breaks. Its like I was one of those cartoon characters when the steams blows out of their ears, yea Travis caused the reaction a few times. Then Abby would make up and everything was alright in the world again until the next issue. So it was just that small detailed, but I still loved and thought like the rating says, that the book was outstanding. So if Beautiful Disaster is still sitting in your reading pile as TBR or you haven't bought it, I suggest that you do and very soon. I am excited to read Walking Disaster that's written in Travis's POV and read his side of the story. I bet then I'll understand Mr. Macho. - Yaraas I did love him, I also hated him at times.

B000FTWB7G|5|This cd is awesome! I always wondered how they would possibly come close to Fallen.  Hard to pick a favorite on this cd.  It is loaded.  Even though Call Me When You're Sober is a good song it is not close to the best on this work.  Lithium, Lacrymosa, The Only One are amongst my favs. <br />Enjoy!
B0055PGUYU|5|The book was well researched and well put together.  Each chapter in addition to telling a story, provided direct examples of how habits are created, their power, and the ability they have to transform individuals, corporations and even societies.  It is an engaging book about a topic that affects every one of us.  Definitely a 5 star for me.
B00FF7FNH8|1|I tried it on a video and within seconds something popped up saying your android device may have a virus, etc. I immediately canceled out of everything and deleted it. Not willing to risk my device for this.
B004TI5N38|5|Kept me wondering where it was going next. Great read.
B008NMT684|5|My son loves doing these puzzles, he can't get enough of them!!  He is big in to trucks and cars!!! Just wish it was a little harder for him
B000AJIF4E|5|I order this for my son who writes and records music.  He stated 'professional, do you see the words professional?' he was so proud of these head phone although they were pricey he loves them.  The feel of the pads on his ears and the sounds that are amplified makes this a great hearing aid for persons who like to hear and feel sounds when they are recording.  The quality of the headphones and the ability to stretch are great. The service and shipment was great.  Will recommend and will be ordering some pads for the headphone soon.
B007JF87VS|5|This episode was a long time coming! I have been disappointed in the recent episodes, but this one was fantastic. Great directing. The last few scenes stick with you and remind you why you liked the show to begin with.
068987474X|1|this book really misses the mark.  it clearly lumps us men into a dumb, unemotional, self-absorbed category.  yet it preaches that women should be able to dump their man with no emotional consequences and that the relationship should revolve their every wants, needs and desires.  it speaks nothing of a mutually benefital relationship or a way to mend the problems plaguing the relationship, it's just dump him, dump him, dump him and oh i forgot to mention dump him.  the one star is given because it is great for holding the door open and also letting any jerry springer type women know they shouldn't date a married man.
B00F8L2VO4|4|Double thumbs up for this app. It's a great way to freshen up and learn a new language fast.
B00F8F3J2S|5|Amazing dedication to his country . Details galore on the inner workings of our military/ industrial/ political processes . A wake up call awaits all readers . May God help us .
B002UXRGLG|5|SO MUCH BETTER THAN THE ONE NARRATED BY OPRAH
1452101248|5|This cookbook has become my bible since I received it; I absolutely love the recipes.  I am a cook who enjoys a bit of a challenge, as well as new tastes and out-of-the-box thinking.  That said, it will be difficult to find certain ingredients, but you can always substitute with something similar.  If you like to color outside of the lines, you'll love this book.
B00P7PJ9P0|4|Kid's loved it. Entertaining movie
B009UX2YAC|1|The updates erase all of your data and it is bad because it only updates if you erase the app then 're download it. You should tell people that before they get the app.
B00JQHON74|3|A medium cd of the new Yes.
0375507256|4|Like most people, it took me a couple chapters to get into this book.  Once I did, I greatly enjoyed it and loved all of the individual stories.  However, I think I either missed something, or the book just doesn't wrap everything up as I was hoping it would.  I know there is not supposed to be much of a link between the stories, but it seems like more of 6 great stories with a weak thread holding it all together.  I did like this book a lot and I can't wait to see the movie in a couple weeks.  I hope the Wachowski's can pull everything together and create an excellent ending.
0977326403|1|snooooooooooze fest.  had to read it for school.
B0024RIMBG|5|We played the DVD's many times. The more you play it, the better it gets. The group is astounding & their voices are heavenly!! You will thoroughly enjoy these DVD's, I guarantee it. I didn't know people could sing like these do.
B00000J1YR|5|I'm not normally a person who buys live albums for the exact reasons some have given, missed chords, acoustics, yelling over top the music.  However, when it came to this album, I wanted it to be live.  Mark Knopfler gives the guitar a lesson on being a guitar and what it is capable of.  To think, in the 50s and early 60s, the guitar was &#34;incidental&#34; music in the band, slightly better than the bass (if available) or drums for keeping a beat.<br /><br />Dire Straits have a place on ANYBODY's CD collection.  Down to the Waterline is one of my truest favorite DS songs.  Knopfler nails it!  Sultans of Swing, the song that put them on the map... Knopfler nails it.  Six Blade Knife, Knopfler's homage to that nameless jazz-soul-funk... Again, Knopfler nails it.<br /><br />Track 8, Tunnel of Love, was recorded live on the stage of the Old Grey Whistle Test on January 31, 1981.  Sadly I had left the UK about six months before that or I would have watched the show as well.  Old Grey Whistle Test was the show THE groups wanted to be on in the UK.  Great stuff!
B005DC68NI|5|As a newly published indie author, I found David's advice to be very practical. It's easy to get overwhelmed with information and advice, but this book does a great job of explaining what your priorities should be and shares practical tips that make it easy to know what to do next. Very helpful and well worth the money.
0671034065|4|Mr. Perfect is Sam Donovan who has to be one of the best Linda Howard heros in years. Faithful, Nice, Dependable, Steady job and oh yeah ... heh,  heh, hem, ... most of the other Mr. Perfect qualifications too. The dialogs  between Sam and Jaine were zingers and always LOL funny.  And Sexy!  No  one, absolutely no one, writes sexual tension the way Linda Howard does,  and Mr. Perfect doesn't fail the standard.<br />Unfortunately, while the  romance between Jaine and Sam is five-star terrific, the murder mystery is  3 star so-so, and the blood and gore is 1 star Yuck!  I guessed  &quot;whodunnit&quot; immediately, so no surprises there for me.  And the  blood, gore and horror of the murders did not juxtapose well.  Sam and  Jaine deserved a different vehicle for their romance.   <br />Some small  quibbles with the ending of the romance... Jaine's &quot;engagement  problem&quot; was more or less a running gag through the entire book, so  what happened in the end?  Did she and Sam actually make it to the altar?   And what about Sam's new State job?  Did Jaine quit her job to follow Sam?   And what happened with the two houses?  I think an epilogue tieing up these  loose ends was clearly needed and without it the book just didn't seem  finished to me.
6305882592|5|MOVIE CAME VERY FAST,<br />SO GLAD A FRIEND BOUGHT ONE SO I CAN SEE<br />IT. I WILL WATCH IT MANY TIMES OVER.
B00C8S9W0G|5|Picks up right where the previous Echo In The Bone left off. All the people we love in the rich colorful history Diana paints so well.
B00821OX98|5|Hey, I admit it, I like SciFi, after season 1, I went for 2, then had to buy 3, where's 4?
B003VS0CX8|5|Seeing is believing, this Blu Ray is breathtaking in so many scenes. The scenes in the Abbey were so crisp I felt like I was 10 again seeing the film for the first time on the big screen in an early 70s revival. Salzburg has never looked this good. You can even see the delicate patterns in the tweed jackets.   The audio is music to the ears (don't shoot me for the bad pun please). The 5:1 sounds studio quality again.   Did anyone else have a crush on Christopher Plummer the first time you saw the movie?
B005BCE7II|5|Excellent animated movie with great 3D effects. A fun event for the whloe family. Highly recommended. All of our friends were impressed too.
B00D3V97DO|5|great album, i'd enjoy every single song. They still playing like the old days, like if they still young..wow!!!Ozzy is forever
B00N1HONIO|4|it's awesome and I can't wait to get on a custom night,it's scary and there's power but just one thing for me,I can barely turn left for the light or the door,but that problem is just for me and maybe you,but other than that.ITS AAAWWWEEESSOOMME!!!!!!.and why. cause it's scary and fun. They keep coming faster and faster each night. And the secret 6th and custom night are challenging.
B000001FK3|5|Been listening to this one for years. Brings back a lot of memories. And here's seven more words for ya.
B00F88GRSS|4|If you saw Liberaci on tv back in the day you will appreciate this movie.
B00IKZX1ZI|2|Frozen free fall was a lot of fun to play, My daughter told me to try it ,I had a lot of fun.
B0040JHLM2|4|I ordered this shoe after reviewing available running shoes on Amazon.com and I am happy with my purchase! It is very light and provides a good cushion to the feet, along with the intended stability. It seems to be made of quality materials, and appears well stitched and cushioned. You can clearly make out the lightness of the shoe compared to the one I had before (a regular Nike sneaker) and running is that much easier with this one. I would recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a well cushioned light shoe for running.
B0000VAFO0|5|Vampires, Lycans, Humans ... oh my!!  Kate Beckinsale is a vampire (death dealer to the lycans) in black Leather. Action filled!  you will love this movie if are a fan of the Vampire genre
B005CRQ4GU|5|I loved the entire series, I can't wait for the next book. The dance was a wreck, I hope my dance won't end like that!
B00QLVY7J2|5|This game can keep you occupied!  Great for passing time, or on trips, you need to think a move or two ahead, very satisfying when you complete a round and move to the next challenge.
B004DLPXAO|5|I installed the Kindle app on my Archos tablet running Android 4.0. and it installed easily and the app functions perfectly as it should. Downloaded all of my archived books without a hitch.
B004XJRQUQ|5|I enjoyed reading all three books in a week!
B005LAIHPE|4|Its a good movie, but LIAM NIELSON SUCKS
B000G1ALRK|5|This cd exceeded my expectations . I am more of a Rock and Roll kind of guy but really enjoy Eric's music. Lots of great guitar and old style vocals . Not the pop sound that is taking over country music of today. This isn't one bad song on the entire cd. The production quality is very good so enjoy
B000AMJG4Y|1|I have to say this is one of the most bizarre films I've ever seen, it utterly makes no sense. You can't just substitute awesome CG action for a coherent story that is uninteresting and has no continuity to it whatsoever. Don't even bother with this movie unless you have played multiple FF games in the past as it will make no sense at all if you have not and is full of the weird sensibilities that the japanese creators of the games have as well as the strange modern japanese sensibilities in general.    The previous FF CG film was great, it had a coherent story that didn't require a detailed knowledge of the FF world and had normal people in it as well as a focused story, this has none of that. It's all over the map with some planet life force and these new age ninja slacker japanese types asking about mother, whatever that means. This film is only good for showing just how beautiful you can make a CG film, like something they play on a huge LCD at a game convention for hours, it's not by any means entertainment that most people in the USA would get anything out of.
B005MLOKXA|5|Love this show,I am  completely addicted !
B001QERPDO|5|Bought it for a Christmas gift.  Big hit.
B00FAPF5U0|1|I understand &#34;free&#34; apps require some monetizing mechanism, but I find Candy Crush's mechanism completely annoying. It's one thing to be prompted to pay to unlock upgrades, perks, skins, and other in-game goodies sooner than later, but for the game to completely lock you out for an entire day after a set number of attempts of simply playing and progressing through the game normally is particularly troubling. I was enjoying this game enough that I actually would be willing to pay $5 for unlimited play time. But I refuse to be continually bled in this manner.
B00IKZX1ZI|3|I pass the time with this. There are some levels that are hard<br />Challenging at Times and the music I find calming.
B0025WX2YW|5|The acting is phenomenal and it was never boring! I wish Showtime would do a series on the rise and reign of Elizabeth and/or Victoria.
B00AQL8VU4|5|I think I would be lost without this app? I get a lot of use out of it, even if it is just window shopping?
B00IRISI42|5|As always another great book from this author!
0812550706|3|Recently the book, The Hunger Games, by Suzanne Collins swept over the country and now has a motion picture coming out. Since I've already read it and LOVED it, I focused on trying to find a book that could be put in the same context as The Hunger Games. The novel, Ender's Game, by Orson Scott Card also had children fighting each other while adults watch and somewhat encourage it. Ender Wiggin, the child genius protagonist, was carefully selected to train to become a future leader to fight the \\"buggers\\", a violent alien invader, after beating up his school bully. I think Card does a fabulous job of bringing up all kinds of themes throughout the writing. I enjoyed the extremity of competition, the different kinds of friendship displayed, and his demonstration of how very differently youth think than adults. My favorite theme challenged an idea that Ender encountered early on in Battle School: Winning is more important over than anything. Even though this is definitely not a fairytale, Ender's Game addresses real issues of strained family relationships and obstacles to building trust, which makes me comfortable recommending this book to a large audience. This book may be a little harsh for children to read due to the violence and language.
B0009JAENU|5|I love listening to &#34;Violin Sonatas&#34; almost everyday.
B006HTUZ1C|4|The instructions are simple and it's easy to play. It would be better if you could make awesums in more ways than just stacking them, though!
B009AMAGQM|3|I was a little disappointed in the story line? 'the story line was a bit confusing with the sister and mother?
B00FZLFQ0I|5|I saw Frozen in the cinema and thoroughly enjoyed it. The music, the story, the scenery, the effects and the sheer imagination of the entire movie is wonderful. The characters are memorable and loveable, there are some hilarious lines from Olaf and... I can go on forever. This movie will go down in history as one of Disney's finest, definitely the best Disney movie of this century and will always be a favourite of mine. Highly recommended.
B00A2AHU2E|5|I loved the move The Professional. I though all the cast was great and Natalie Portman for being so young at the time did a great job of acting.  I even bought the move when it came out on VHS.
B0064TVQ5E|5|Lots of levels and a great way to pass the time :) Best one I've found yet for a free app
B005UKJX4E|1|this movie is 2.5 hours long - if you cut out the crap it would be about 20 minutes long - might be the worst movie I have ever seen.<br />As the movie went on (and on) I kept waiting for it to improve - it never did
B009IRVSVQ|1|I was super excited to get this CD because I had been streaming it from the Bruno Mars CD for a week. Unfortunately when I recieved it, it will not play in my car (the whole reason I bought the CD instead of downloading it on my computer). Then I find out that there is a deluxe version with additional tracks (avaliable at Target). I am majorly disappointed. Not in the music (obviously) but in the product provided by Amazon. Also, when I bought it (a week ago) I was told I would get it it the day the CD came out (12/11/12) but I actually did not recieve it until 12/12/12. Overall, I am majorly disappointed by Amazon's service. But the music itself is AWESOME!
B006LSZECO|3|It is a good book so far I need to read more before I can really judge it but so far so good
B00I8Q77Y0|5|Grratttt game<br />Get it it is good
B0089BSM70|3|Um, what happened to the subtitles for this movie. Although this is the best sequel of all times, studio should have found a way to cut deleted scenes into theatrical version. Still, I was grateful for tv version, which I liked better than the theatrical version because of the extra scenes!
B00CKJ2KK2|5|huge fan of gamelofts creations but i saw on youtube channel you guys had a update for it but never brought it to the kindle fire hd do you guys nly respect ipod and ios players plz bring new update to kindle fire hd ......i know theres a update because it uas a new map and new game modes<br />and new level ups
B0031KC8OC|5|I had see all the news about the Kickstarter campaign for the new Veronica Mars movie and wanted to check out the series.  I was pleasantly surprised at how much I like the series.  I was thinking it would be more campy like Buffy (which I love) but it actually turns out Veronica can be a little dark at times (which I also like).  Love Veronica and her relationship with her dad. I like how strong Veronica is in the face of being abandoned by her former friends.
0062428551|5|beaitiful hardback edition.  Sealed. Will keep it that way. Thanks.  Very fast delivery
B000002AT6|4|I absolutely love James Horner and his works, and I was not at all surprised when I listened to this stunning soundtrack.  The soundtrack brings peaceul serenity of the wilderness along with the sudden unpredictability of human character (in this case Tristan's).  It won't lull you to sleep so easily, but I am certain that is exactly what Horner wants- he doesn't want a lullaby but a soundtrack to describe the feelings, and the days of the characters who live the music.  Like the soundtracks of \\"Titanic\\", \\"Swing Kids\\", \\"The New World\\", and \\"Troy\\", the music will take you to another time, and mutes out the sound of traffic, and noise of this busy present day, to bring you near to the heart of the past and it's tumultuous times that seem all more beautiful than what we experience today.  For the regular people who are certain this music should only be confined to stuffy elderly people wanting a nap, prepare to be proved wrong as a teenager wrote this.  I highly encourage you to if not buy, at least listen to this music.    -s.budgeon
B000O8OTNC|4|pretty sweet little sharpener
B004I8WD7S|5|I got this one as a replacement  of an SGP Case I had been using for a while now. The Amazon Basics case, while not as fancy as the one I had before, performs as expected and protects my iPhone 4 as needed.<br /><br />The material (TPU) is not as soft as it may seem in the pictures, but is not plastic like other products available, which is great, other cases I have seen made out of plastic slip trough one's fingers, which is not the case with this one. It is also slightly transparent, which I suppose is good for those who want the iPhone design not to be covered completely.<br /><br />Additionally, a screen protector (I highly recommend you use it to avoid scratches and the like) and a cleaning cloth are included.<br /><br />Besides being a product that looks well and of quality, you simply cannot beat the price. The Amazon logo is printed on the back of the case, as any other brand would be (call me crazy but I think it looks cool) As if that were not enough, a one year limited warranty is also included.<br /><br />If you are looking for protection, quality and good looks (again, nothing fancy but simple), you can go no wrong with this protective case.
B008O9V4C2|5|I'm of a younger generation than, probably, the majority of people who have been listening to Steely Dan, since they are likely dipping into their Medicare pretty hard by now. In fact, I never, ever heard of Donald Fagen until just a few days ago when me and some amigos were shopping at a local CD store and daring each other to buy ultra-cheap albums from unknown-to-us artists from the dollar bin section. As if by chance, I happened to just reach into said bin and pull out the first CD I laid my hands on, and it happened to be Donald Fagen's Sunken Condos! Wow! After taking it home that early morning, I couldn't believe the awesomeness of Donald's very generous, new offering of just nine songs that could have easily fit better on an EP instead of a \\"CD.\\" But still, this EP introduced me to a new artist, for which I'm thankful.<br /><br />I guess a fair comparison to make about Donald and his awesome music is to liken him to the late, great G.G. Allin since both of them appear to be from the same generation of current Medicare dependents. As far as his actual tunes go, I'm surprised that I enjoy Donald's fourth solo album so passionately! For instance, I'm Not the Same Without You seems like a clich&eacute;d love ballad, but when you listen to it very intently as I did, you immediately understand that this is more than just a clich&eacute;d love ballad; it's a clich&eacute;d love ballad that only cost me a dollar and that Carl Douglas would be proud to call his own. I feel like I learned a lot about arrangements and block-rockin' beats just from listening to this song. Weather In My Head is another winner because it is clearly influenced by the groovy sounds of The Captain and Teneel, if The Captain and Teneel took some crystal meth and decided to sell some music on iTunes, that is!<br /><br />Even though I really like Donald now and can't wait for his fifth album when he hits his 70s, I still have to criticize his fourth solo album just a little bit, especially since my many years of life experience have made me an absolute music connoisseur and expert. On songs like The New Breed and Miss Marine, Donald seems to be trying to channel Marylin Manson and Kiss, yet he would be so much better served if he instead channeled Cher and Liberace. Similarly, if Donald would take some cues from The Insane Clown Posse and The Backyard Wrestling Soundtrack, I think that he would easily avoid some of the production problems and slurred singing on tracks like Planet Rhonda and Out Of The Ghetto.<br /><br />Still, for a retiring baby boomer, this is a solid effort, and I give Donald a pat on the back for this stellar effort at making a listenable album. You go, old timer! I hope he doesn't quit the music business and puts out even more inspiring EPs like this one.life experience have made me an absolute music connoisseur and expert.

B00F3B3H3S|4|It is a great set but a bit pricey for what it is. The cloud Cuckoo house is only about the size of two small cups. Besides that I had a lot of fun building it with my dad and had even more fun playing with it. Emmet, unikitty, and wildstyle look just like they do in the movie. Wildstyle and Emmets heads are even referable.

B008JFUN6E|4|Our world is progressing leaps and bounds in so many areas.<br />Even today we have nations that still live as they dis a hundred years ago.<br />We now live in a somewhat cast society. This film reflects just that. The movie<br />is entertaining but if you think about all the things which went into making of this film,<br />It's not to far fetched to wonder if it can happen to the human race.
B00BD99JMW|4|I loved all the books in this series and this one did not disappoint. Be prepared to cry but know it is worth it.
0060853980|5|This book is so goofy. The writing is smooth. I love it. I often loan it out to people. I think that is why my copy is missing. This is a must read.
B00001MXXH|5|FERRIS BUELLER'S DAY OFF gave us numerable cinematic moments--all of them timeless.  The \\"Twist & Shout\\" celebration in downtown Chi-Town.  The Ferrari crashing through a plate glass garage.  Matthew Broderick's impish deadpan to the camera.  Ben Stein's monotone chant, \\"Bueller. . .Bueller. . .Bueller. . .\\"  All of the above (and more) made for one grand time when this film came out in 1986; all of the above continues to treat viewers to one grand time today.<br /><br />Writer/director John Hughes makes truancy downright charming as we enjoy the antics of laid-back Ferris Bueller (Broderick) and two of his buds cutting class on a delightful spring day.  Having suckered his parents (and the entire city of Chicago, for that matter) into believing he is sick, Ferris makes the best of his temporary freedom; he and his pals enjoy fine dining, a Cubs game, participate in a parade, go for a swim.  And all the while, Ferris is being pursued by his relentless, yet unlucky, principal (Jeffrey Jones is hilarious).  The administrator knows Ferris is playing hookey--he's just having one dickens of a time catching Bueller in the act.<br /><br />As humorous as this entire film is, it succeeds and flows and works because Broderick so aptly carries it.  Whether he's talking his best friend into \\"borrowing\\" the friend's father's sports car, or he's deadpanning to the camera any number of optimistic \\"Buellerisms,\\" Broderick is always charming, witty, and deliciously ornery.  Even after the closing credits have rolled, Broderick makes a hasty appearance to admonish his audience (\\"You're still here?  Go home!\\").  Broderick's been in several flicks, but here he's never been better; and next to \\"Caddyshack\\" FERRIS BUELLER'S DAY OFF is the finest comedy the Eighties has to offer.<br />--D. Mikels, Author, [[ASIN:1413406114 Walk-On]]
B002QE3CTY|4|I really did enjoy this book; the characters were developed enough for me to want to follow and learn more about their stories; scenario is curious enough.  I think any fan of dystopian story-lines would love this book... my only dislike is the fact that this is a series, so who knows if there will ever be a conclusion to the main challenges. I would read the subsequent books, but I don't feel the need to run out and get them for that reason--there may not be a finale.

0553260111|5|I enjoyed reading this book very much.  It is truly a 'page turner'.  the opening paragraphs in chapter one are some of the most exciting and vivid I have read in over 50 years of avid reading.  if you like reading thrillers, mysteries, or adventures, you will enjoy reading this one and the two sequels that follow it (Bourne Supremecy + Bourne Ultimatum).
B00AQ3K8IU|5|The first half of this book was confusing in a wonderful way. It had me scratching my head and thinking &#34;Where is this going?&#34; Holders passion was evident very early on but some of his behaviors seemed a little weird. They story is so gripping and the characters so real though that your eyes stay glued to the page. When I got to the meat of the story I was completely blown away. The depth of emotion that the author is able to portray is astounding. The subject matter is dark so it would be easy for it to turn into a depressing read but its told in such a mature and hopeful way that you come away proud of both Holden and Sky, with a happy outlook for their future.<br /><br />Another thing that deserves mention is the wit and humor that is peppered throughout the book. The friendship between Six and Sky is quirky and fun, but my favorite part is the texts that Holden sends Sky. They add a bit of sunshine to what is a pretty stormy book.

The book wasz a total waste of time and money. Lol Iknow it sounds weird, but my feelings were hurt. She should of put SOME kind of effort in her last sookie book, Imean come on<br />I have never written a review before. Ever but Ihad to for this.<br />This book is total cr*p!

B0070Y46UY|4|A great story, I really enjoyed this
B008602KQI|5|I rated this a 5 star movie.  I was most impressed by the script and the way the actors portrayed the main characters.
B0001L3MI0|4|No doubt Independence Day is a pretty entertaining film.  The acting is a bit of a stretch at times (the best performances seem to be given by the supporting actors/actresses instead of the mainstay people, save for Will Smith's comedic role as Captain Hiller).  Vivica A. Fox provides a touching, well-acted and believable role in the movie, as does Mary McDonnell as the First Lady; environmentalist and scientific genius David Levinson is a bumbling and comedic, though unbelievable especially during his \\"drunk\\" rants and raves about blowing up the earth, when really someone that wasted wouldn't be able to talk that fast or in such detail (interestingly, the actor who plays him is the same as Jurassic Park--and his characters speak under their breaths as well).  Thoroughly entertaining in many ways.  Of course, the aliens have two legs and two eyes, making them more human--which is something they wouldn't be scientifically because they'd be somewhat related to the human race if they were so; they also look quite familiar to last year's War of the Worlds.  Overall, Independence Day is brilliant save for some acting.
B009YP9L7U|5|what a cute story with a twist it worked out really nice but the twist are worth the read definitely worthy
B0007PAMR4|4|In response to the preliminary info posted above, you cannot crop a 4:3 image into scope. What is being advertised is a true anamorphic widescreen version of the extended edition, which has never before been available. There's no reason to believe that the original elements for the extended scenes do not exist, and these scenes were originally shot in 2.35:1 so I wouldn't worry about this release unless Universal retracts their announcement. Many films were panned & scanned for television and we now have their original versions available on DVD today. Now this is not to suggest that Universal hasn't got a big job on their hands. Many of these extended shots will have to be completed and cleaned up in order to be presented in widescreen, so it should be interesting to see what they come up with. I'd pay attention to reviews when we get closer to May and if it turns out to be a proper restoration, treat yourself and buy it immediately!
B00000HYXB|4|I purchased this as my first BG exposure based upon the reviews here, and I would have to say that I am pleased with their performance.<br />I may be partial to concept discs since there are so few and it takes quite a bit of  skill to pull one off well (eg, Operation: Mindcrime). I am puzzled by the  previous review who didn't think they did a good job or that it wasn't  melodic, but everyone has an opinion. Perhaps it is because I don't have  their previous discs to compare to or that I haven't read The Silmarillion  (my knowledge of Tolkien is limited to the Lord of the Rings  Trilogy).<br />The lyrics were complex as I would expect from Tolkien, but I  could follow the basic story when I thought about it. BG's arrangements  were suitably complex, each having a taste of medieval times but none  sounding like the other. I felt the main songs flowed together well,  regardless of the short interludes of narration, sounds, or song between  them all.<br />My only real complaint of the disc, which kept it from getting  5 stars for me, was I found Hansi's vocals to be rather irritating at  times, usually when he was in higher pitches or what sounded like yelling  out the lyrics rather than singing them. His voice had a hard edge and  harshness that I didn't care for. There were some instances where this  seemed appropriate, but they were few and far between. His lower range and  when he was truly singing didn't seem to bother me.<br />I think I will buy  the Imaginations disc sometime to see how they sounded a couple years back  and will certainly look for their next offering.
031604461X|5|I have ready many reviews for Breaking Dawn, both good and bad.  I think that the key to what you will think of the book is where you are coming from.  If you are a male or a young teenager or young adult, you may not understand where the author is coming from.  However, as a woman of similar age and background, I can understand why the author chose to go the way she did with the plot.  I can understand what it's like to not really be expecting a baby, but then knowing that you can't live without it as soon as you discover you are pregnant, especially when the child is that of someone you are madly in love with.  I do wish that there was more detail on the romantic scenes, because we had become used to that fromt he previous books, but sometimes open-ended is good, because you can paint the scene you want.  I think the author was creative with the broken headboard and the feathers, etc.  More action in the end would have been good, but I think that if you read carefully, you pick up on the fact that the danger is not over.  Someday the Italians are going to come after their coven.  They are not going to let this go forever.  We are left with real life in the end of the book...things are great, but you know they can't stay that way forever.  The future, even for the undead, is uncertain.  Overall, I loved the book and I can see that the author put all of herself in the book, because I see so much of myself in the book.

B000002LFU|3|Released on election day,1988,&quot;Green was REMs first album put out in the glare of the mainstream spot-light,and the preassure shows.Not the preassure to live up to the commercial expectations set by the massive(and unexpected) success of the single &quot;The One I Love&quot; from the previous year,but the preassure to not &quot;sell out&quot;,and become the &quot;ordinary&quot; rock band it's loyal fans had always feared and loathed.Never a band to let outside opinions dictate the coarse of it's music,nevertheless here they tend to keep thier considerable pop chops in check,in favor of an &quot;edgy&quot; politicaly-influenced sound.It just doesn't suit them.Which is not to say that stompers like &quot;Turn You Inside-Out&quot; and &quot;Orange Crush&quot; don't have a certain forward rush;indeed these songs hint at a ferocious bar-band peeping from behind the sensetive-boho curtain.But the likes of &quot;The Wrong Child&quot;,You Are The Everything&quot;&quot;Hairshirt&quot;,and &quot;I Remember California&quot; are utterly interminable,droning on forever and going nowhere.REM never let itself become bombastic or overwrought at even it's hardest-rocking moments,but on these tracks,tender sentiments and heart-felt greivences are inexplicably delivered with a sledge-hammer.Thankfully,&quot;Green&quot; also includes one of the band's greatest singles&quot;Stand&quot;,a deliriously catchy sing-along that could redeem any record,as well as a beautifully bouncy untitled eleventh track that closes the album on a simple,pleasing note.Looking back,one could easily divide the coarse of REMs career into three distinct phases:the first was the &quot;Murmur&quot; through &quot;Fables of the Reconstruction&quot; period,where the band presented short,sharp shocks of expertly crafted folk-pop decked out in a dapper bohemian-new-wave sweater-vest,the second began with &quot;Life's Rich Pageant,and ends(thankfully)here with this album,with the band veturing into political arena-stomping and heavy-handed &quot;message&quot; ballads.Of coarse,the third phase(continuing to this day) is the one started with &quot;Out Of Time&quot;,released three years after this one,that more than makes up for the awkward miss-steps of the late-eighties.
B00742GBDM|2|This is a charming moving, it just isn't the story Jane Austin wrote. Fanny Price was proper and quiet, demure and seldom outspoken. This presentation in no way represents the book and perhaps it isn't possible to cram this book into 2 hours. This is the second movie version of the book that is a disappointment. Maybe another director will get it right in the future, this isn't it.
B0094BB4TW|1|I agree with all of the other reviews posted. Don't know what you guys did but it keeps crashing, freezes, and you can't watch videos. I had no problem with this at app at all and then all of these problems are happening. I did everything to try to fix the problem and it didn't work. Please hurry and fix this problem
B00900NAFI|4|good and clear
B000002KKC|5|Although not as consistently wonderful as &quot;Rumours&quot;, it is, nonetheless, an essential recording to have by this band.
B00K0HDE3I|5|Excellant good Album,  they ever make a bad one.

B0050DIWFC|5|I enjoyed this book.  I was engaged the entire time and didn't see the end coming!
B00003CX5P|5|I have followed the Star Wars Saga since it was first released.  So glad to have purchased the beginning of the story.<br />If you are a sci-fi fan this is the one for you.  Great action packed story.  Fast paced and exciting.  I love it and I think you would too.
B003O86FMW|5|Love Love love this book can't wait to read the next book and watch all the movies five star book
B004FGMDOQ|5|I can't say enough good things about this book. Well written, creative, a true gem. Thanks Amazon for suggesting it!
B00DPM7TIG|5|I felt as if I were floating as I read \\"All the Light...\\".  It has the most beautiful prose and loveliest story I have read<br />In years.  Magnificent!
0545128285|3|My daughter, who is 10, is crazy about Harry Potter. She read this book in an afternoon and tossed it aside.  Asked how she liked it, she said, \\"It was okay. It didn't have very many stories\\".
B00005JNX0|1|I would like to watch this movie, but the discs don't work. I first bought the Madagascar (Widescreen) DVD. Two different computers and two different DVD media software programs refused to play the disc. I waited a long time and got the Blu-Ray version, which refuses to play on a laptop purchased just last November 2010. The movie is not available on Amazon's video on demand or on iTunes. End result: I didn't get to see it at the theater and don't have more than basic cable. I've now bought two non-working discs. I guess I'll have to wait for it on iTunes or find a friend who has it, because I don't want to be fooled a third time into paying for another disc.    Sure, the movie may be great, but I'll never know, because neither the DVD nor the Blu-Ray will play. I feel like I've been robbed twice. I was looking forward to a fun romp of a movie. Maybe if it ever comes on iTunes I can rent it. Bah.
031606792X|3|I was pleased and displeased with this particular item. The book itself is in very good shape (new), but the service is what displeased me. The shipping took over a week, and the book didn't come in a box - I'm all for saving cardboard, but when one has to tear off the layers of paper taped (excessively) around the book makes things difficult. While one tries to unwrap the book, it's difficult to avoid ripping/damaging the cover sleeve in the process.
B00JVUAJ2O|5|Can never get enough
B00169N0BK|2|I really wanted this to work. Unfortunately the prints looked terrible. I am giving it two stars because Amazon made the return process so easy and the product was easy to use<br /><br />First, my equipment is an Apple Imac 24, Mac OS 10.4.11. I used the auto monitor calibration and did not see much change, but that wasn't too surprising as I had already calibrated the monitor. I really wanted to do the printer calibration. I have two Epson Photo printers; a 2200 and a 3800. I can get good prints out of them (fantastic prints out of the 3800) but they often don't look exactly like whats on the screen. That was my goal, having a close a match to my screen appearance as to the print. Wasn't even close.<br /><br />I redid the calibration several times, on both printers and for me, on my system, it did not work. I have read other reviews where they had great luck, but in may case it didn't work.<br /><br />Amazon was fine about the return and even paid for the return shipping via uPS ground, the Amazon experience was excellent, and the ColorMunki was very easy to use but the printed output was terrible.
B0000VCZKM|5|I have been wanting this DVD for some time!  I have a foster home where my residents  cant watch it often enough. Thank You for the quick and courteous service too!
B00PSLQYWE|5|Having all of the actors working together to make a scene turn out beautifully was a great way to keep me wanting to see the next season. I am enjoying a different type of show that gives me another way to view things.  I give this a big thumbs up for those who like seeing what the past may have been like,  with a hint of how devious people can be.
B0039HR5QS|5|Very very good movie. Interesting and intriguing plot, Robert Redford plays very well and Sidney Pollack's direction is fantastic in my opinion. I watch this movie once a year.
B004LOMB2Q|1|I want an app to take some notes, but not at the expense of my contact info and content privacy. Change these permissions. Not installing this app.<br /><br />12/5/2013 Update:  I started using Google Keep, which is an extension of Google Docs, and haven't had any regrets.
B00L23SE52|5|This movie is for the average Emmett out there.  We've all been there, the yellow faced nobody that just cant seem to make any friends.  This movie is for you, to help you realize that you are apart of the world the Man Upstairs created, that you have limitless potential and are capable of doing more than simply existing. If you would like to know more about the Man Upstairs, order this DVD.  Along with this DVD comes a card in which you may call to have representatives of the Man Upstairs come to your home and teach you more about being Special.  May you never be micromanaged and may you always find yourself free from the captivity of Lord Business and his cunning devices.
B00KGRFV92|5|This series was very interesting and informative. It gives you a look into the lives of the marines who served in the pacific during world war II. I watched this over the memorial day weekend, and it gave me a deeper appreciation for the freedom we enjoy and the young men who sacrificed so much so that we can enjoy our freedom. Thank you Amazon for HBO!
B002C1BHIO|5|I am not the most technically savvy person, so I can only tell you what I see and understand about this product.  First of all, it was incredibly easy to open.  There were no fights with the plastic boxes that seem to have no openings and I was not forced to resort to arming myself with scissors or a box cutter, greatly reducing the chances of injury.  Who wants their tombstone to read \\"She died valiantly fighting product packaging\\"?  Second, the cable looks great.  It seems far sturdier than other cables I have used in the past and the bits on each end look well made.  Third, and perhaps most important, this product is backed by Amazon, meaning good customer service and support, as well as easy return (if needed).  The product has a 1-year warranty and since I have not had any problems with Amazon service in the past, I am sure that using that warranty, if necessary, would be easy.  I am glad that Amazon has started the Amazon Basics line.  It removes the need for all those little trips to the electronics store and replaced it with easy shopping and easy shipping at competitive prices.
B00BD99JMW|5|It was awesome, all the books are great!!
B001FB4VXU|5|The funniest series on television.  Being able to watch the episodes in order and as time permits makes this a great buy.
B00MR8YLI0|5|Great combination, and great arrangements.
B00QROI70S|5|Awesome movie. Wife loved it.
031606792X|5|Grand Finale to the best Vampire & Werewolf Soap Opera stories I have ever read in my entire life. I have never wanted to read all the books from the charactors in a movie until now and I am over 40 years old. Stephanie Meyers sure knows how to write great stories.
B00H71PBQ8|5|Love the show!  The contrast of upstairs/downstairs and the drama of life!  Castle and clothing are gorgeous, and lend a look into a lifestyle rarely seen by most!
B0068853O6|5|Great series. So very typical of war, young men at war, and the ambitions of some.
B0086DBE62|2|This should have been a fantastic movie that is high underrated. It had all of the elements to make this a new enchanting story that brought down the house. It did not. I really wanted to enjoy this. Sadly, I did not. I just didn't like it.<br /><br />I think Julia Roberts made a good queen. The queen and the costumes were the best part about the movie.
B0064MPXFA|5|Definitely worth the watch! Amazing show and cast. Youll be hooked.
B008P1EWIM|5|I`m very happy with this. It tells you everything you want to, from the temperature to the wind speed, and a week long forecast.
B0042EJD8A|5|A very well done documentary.  All information is presented in a practical, empirical, and scientific manner. I dislike a lot of other social, environmental, and political documentaries because they over-dramatize the presentation of events and facts so that it detracts from the important messages and information. This film follows through on every point in a logical manner, starting with the various causes of the problems and drawing all the lines to the various ramifications.  The narrator allows you to see his own process of learning and discovery.  If you didn't care about how gas is harvested before, you will after seeing this.  Sure gas burns clean but the manner in which its being extracted now is just as damaging to people and environment as any other fossil fuel.
B00BP4Z8XY|4|This is such a great film. Fun for the whole family. Funny and entertaining.
B00DA6YEKS|5|Great continuation of an awesome series.
B006LSZECO|3|I am very in between with this book. Gillian Flynn does have a very unique writing style. There was something psychologically wrong with the main characters (which is the point). It is the first book I have read and did not like the main characters, but it made it more interesting to read.<br /><br />It did start out slow for me but after you got a hang of how it's written, you are hooked all the way to the very end. The ending was definitely a let down for me but I read it over and over and realize the creepy vibe you get from Amy. *SPOILER ALERT* Nick finally said something that got to her. Amy playing her mind games, playing the hero, and after all the things she has done, she feels somewhat guilt in the end. It's not as of a great ending if you don't think about it. Possibly people wanted more action, or some \\"great\\" future. Or maybe for Nick to \\"win\\" Amy's mind games. I wouldn't know what kind of ending I would have wanted since I don't like Nick or Amy, but if you think about the ending, it makes sense. However, I do crave more.<br /><br />This book definitely messed with me. It was very out there and bizarre, but that's what kept me reading.
0061433047|5|I want more!  This book had me laughing out loud and teary-eyed, though I won't admit to actually shedding any.

B00ESNE696|5|This is art imitating life, Chicago-style politics.  I can grind my teeth as a conservative or just sit back and watch all the fun.  The 5th Season is my least favorite and the show is probably losing ground in this season.  But if you have been following the fun, you just want more.
1582701709|5|I am amazed by the negative reviews. Well, not so much the reviews but what the reviewers choose to pull out of the book, cd or dvd to review..i.e. it is selfish, the weight loss portion, disease, etc.  This is purely put about positive thought.  You put out into the universe what you get back.  If you are consistently putting out the negative, bad humor, gossip, over all junk, this is what you will continually attract back to you because that is where your level of consiousness is.  You expect no different, well, guess what, you will get no different.  When you begin to change how you react inside you will begin to see change on the outside.  Focus on the good or positive and that is what you will receive back.  This can be, as the book, cd and dvd puts it the \\"Universe\\" or it can be God working in your life.  It will depend on your perspective and how much you want to analize how you relate to the world around you and what works for you.  I think this has been a wonderful experience for me and has opened my eyes to the endless possibilities of life - where before, due to culture, religion or what ever, I had a narrower view of what my life could be.  If you pick this up with a poor attitude then that is what you will get out of it...nothing.  If you are willing to open yourself up to the possibilities you will enjoy this and come away different.
B004XDYJRU|4|Very inexpensive upgrade!  Wide ranging.  It's got something for everyone from talk radio, podcasts and any genre of music one could possibly want.
125000568X|5|This is a \\"must have\\" book for all Queen fans.<br />Wonderful pictures and memorabilia ~ I recommend this highly!!<br />This is a beautifully created book with many memories of the greatest (In my opinion)band ever.
B0058YPL66|5|I'm a reader so I honestly don't watch much TV. We don't have cable or even a TV converter box. Most nights I go to bed reading a book instead of watching TV. We do have Netflix, Amazon Prime and Internet access so I do watch a few movies and TV shows occasionally.<br /><br />I find most TV shows and movies are filled with too much sex, violence and language for my comfort level. However I've been pleasantly surprised by how much I have enjoyed season 1 of Once Upon a Time. While on Facebook a while back I read a couple posts from friends who were excited for an upcoming Once Upon a Time episode so I looked to see what it was about.  Being a fairy tale lover it looked like something I might enjoy so I started watching it and I was hooked right from episode 1.<br /><br />The acting, costuming and story-line are all so well done. I adore Rumpelstiltskin.  I appreciate that I have been able to watch these episodes with my teenage daughter as they are family friendly.  We have had some great discussions speculating what will be coming next and how the story might unfold.<br /><br />I'm definitely a fan of this series!!
B00EOARZ4G|5|Always exciting! Another great read by Tom Clancy! Hope that someone will take over this story line. Jack Ryan and Jr along all the other great characters too, can hardly wait (hopefully) for the next installment.
1451696191|3|The cover doesn't look like the one pictured here.  Instead it says World Book Night U.S. I don't know why but that was disappointing.
B0072OFOM6|4|love this series waiting on 3rd one
B00003CXBK|5|If you don't know what Studio Ghibli is, and like good movies watch it already!!  The only think I didn't like about the movie it that it got a little gory at times, so I personally will probably not buy it, but the story is awesome, the animation is awesome, the music is awesome, ya...
B00NQKWAIQ|5|Gave it as a gift -- my daughter loves it.
1451626657|5|I read this book when I was in high school because it was required reading. I really didn't get the full impact of it then. This book is genius. The sarcasm is the perfect dry type of humor to mix well with WW2.
B004L3AQFG|5|You would think that a movie about one man stuck in a narrow canyon for most of the movie would get boring fast. The fact that it doesn't is a testament to the acting of James Franco and direction of Danny Boyle (Trainspotting, Slumdog Millionaire). The soundtrack is a perfect accompaniment to the story as well (and sounds even better on blu-ray). You don't have to be an \\"outdoorsy\\" person to enjoy this film. You just have to have a pulse.
B002N5N4M6|5|son loved getting this for Christmas
B00UENHBAU|5|Wow, this game,man! My favorite part of the game is when Springtrap is introduced. But anyways, this game is just as block-busting as th  others!
B0050DIWFC|4|Good book, kept my interest. The characters seemed real. I liked the way it was written. This was a very fast read.
B004EFYZ1C|5|Works good
0762445262|4|Very small but I knew that from the reviews so I was happy with the product. I actually bought this for a birthday gift and he loved it. (He's an adult, haha.) Probably one of his favorite gifts. Would recommend this for Batman fans. But please be warned it is very small as the description says.
B00003CXA6|5|We had the fairly unique experience of visiting Gettysburg Battlefield while on vacation.  We bought the DVD of \\"Gettysburg\\" at the gift shop, watched it that night, and went back the following day for a more in-depth battlefield tour. <br /> <br />Actually visiting the places where, for example, the 20th Maine made its desperate stand, brought a lot more meaning to the movie. <br /> <br />Jeff Daniels stole the show as the scholar-turned-soldier Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain. His sidekick, the \\"tough old Mick\\" Kilrain, who called him \\"Colonel, Darlin,\\" without being the least bit disrespectful, was perfect. The heart-stopping moment when Chamberlain realizes that his men are out of ammunition and must nonetheless keep the Confederates from reaching the summit of Little Round Top makes the viewer wonder: \\"What, in the name of God, would I do in that situation?\\" When Chamberlain orders his men to \\"fix bayonets,\\" and then charge downhill, it's an awesome thing. <br /> <br />I liked Martin Sheen's portrayal of Robert E. Lee. I thought that he had the Virginia accent down pretty well for a \\"furriner,\\" and he carried a weary dignity about him.  It was said of Lee that his men would, and often did, follow him into Hell.  Sheen's portrayal suggested that kind of magnetism. <br /> <br />This isn't a movie to go into without having done your homework first.  It really helps to know something about how the Civil War was going up to that point, who the major players were, and what the main issues were. There are so many characters and so many shifts back and forth that you can get a disoriented \\"Who's on First\\" kind of feeling. Reading Michael Shaara's book first would also be very helpful. <br /> <br />I found Tom Berenger's portrayal of General Longstreet to be up to his usual high standard, but the makeup people who pasted his beard on did a horrible job.  It made him look like a dimestore Santa. <br /> <br />One note that I found interesting was that the Yankees fought for the Union. Period.  The Confederates, on the other hand, fought for their individual states.  The Virginians, for example, fought for mother, home and family - and the honor of Virginia.  They thought of themselves not as Confederates, or even Americans, but first and foremost, as Virginians. <br /> <br />This movie is not light, mindless entertainment.  It is demanding and emotionally wrenching.  Gettysburg is part of our history - a part of who we are.  <br /> <br />This telling of the story is absolutely first-class.  <br /> <br />

B00632HWOG|5|I give Yahoo a five star rating. I am very satisfied with yahoo. I enjoy the option they provide with the task bar.
B007V2UGPE|4|a real time waster - in a good way. fun for all ages. most glue games are as well. way to go.
B00119ZMKW|5|Exciting show that I just can't get enough of.  They made is so well that others should take note of how to do a serial show the best way.  I wish it could go on forever.
B00000K3UR|4|Most likely all movie-goers will enjoy this movie, even the thick ones who don't like silly comedies. I enjoyed the film, but it could of been better, maybe some music,  better direction and  improved acting from Sandler would  of earnt the film 5 stars. oh, and yeah, if that Cole Sprouse thinks he is  going to be the next Haley Joel Osment, think again, brother.<br />Overall a  funny and enjoyable movie with an awesome cast, something good to watch on  a Saturday.
B00LXLM05I|5|So far this game can be played with out spending money to upgrade. I am at level 12.
B00HCMG6LG|5|this game will keep you on your toes.. great way to pass the time, and get you to think outside the box.<br />cant wait to see what else they can come up with.
B0073LWEXK|5|Wow, this is very eye catching! A lot has been put into this game to make it just astounding to look at. The sound is okay, better than most games. I found myself playing it for the last two hours and it felt like oly five iTunes went by. In other words, look out, this is addicting!!<br /><br />The puzzles are great. Don't use the cheats, it really is more fun to figure it out o our own. I love it when something clicks and you make progress. This is a great ame, they should really make more like it. I think what I like is the layering within.... Sometimes a screen doesn't make sense until you get a vital clue... Or change the seasons... And then it becomes manageable.<br /><br />Bottom line: a ton of fun, beautiful, and challenging!
B0086700CM|4|This game is awesome, but there seems to be some sort of glitch where the game skips and then it doesn't register my touch, so I just fall off the edge or hit a tree and die.
B003UESJH4|5|I was quite surprised how I enjoyed this film. I used to have studdering problems as a youth and yes,  marbles were used as therapy although I do not know how successful the treatment was. I can only surmise the relationship this commoner and the king had fighting the establishment that insisted it had the correct treatment.
B00IXE7274|3|good movie would recommend
B00BD99JMW|4|As if the Author got tired and ran out of brain juice for the 3rd book.<br />Thoughts were fragmented. Fair
B000063Y8F|5|Excellent machine! We used it the first time and there was no complaint at all about HER garlic press.<br />We've finally found the one that works every time. We highly recommend the Rosle Garlic Press.
0679745653|5|Great book! Very good read.  I love the movie and the book is just as good! Would recommend to anyone who loves a good read.
B002U6DVQM|5|Aside from the dazzling visuals, withering satire and amazing sequences - the health spa, the outdoor night party, the 'bullwhip' sequence and others, each w/more juice than 2 \\"regular\\" movies - it's the best flick ever made about how men objectify, misunderstand and misinterpret women.  To quote my fave review here, if you're a \\"wannabe snob elitist\\" - or if ya just happen to have a brain tucked among yer other soft tissues - do not miss this! And BTW guys... Woody Allen copied Fellini, not the other way round.
B00BU1DG1S|4|Started a bit slow, but once adjusted to the rhythm, the story just flowed. Highly recommended :)
B003L20IHE|5|Good stories, like these are the kind you don't mind your kid watching. no cursing, viloence etc (there's enough of that in the real world).
0345806786|5|The shining<br /><br />Jack Torrance is a self destructive and haunted man. He's an alcoholic who uses the drink to placate the ever burning fires inside him. Where had this destruction come from? This downward spiral was one Jack had been down long before he took the job at the Overlook hotel. A job at the famous and grand Overlook hotel in the rural mountains of Colorado.<br />Thinking he's family will gain a fresh start and Jack will once pull himself and his life back together; he gathers his wife and son and he begins the stay with his family as the winter caretaker..<br />What was thought of as balm to the troubles of his past was really a catalyst to his, all of their undoing. It is almost as if the Overlook is a rage full living thing that feeds off the darkness of others. The Overlook picks and jabs and reaches in until there is nothing left but the blackness..<br />The story is also about an abused, hollowed out, frightened shell of a woman; who is still striving to save her son from her possessed husband.<br />And also, the story is about a very special little boy. A boy who shines. A little boy who knows things. He is our hero. This brave little boy who saves them all..<br />This story is not like the movie(s). It is an amazing story..the ending alone is by far so much better than the movie.. Read this book, I would say read it before you watch either of The Shining movies, but seeing as they're so popular, that'd be impossible..just read it anyway.
B00BSBR9N6|5|Quality service and product.
B0000062Y2|5|I have nearly worn my CD out I have listened to it so often! This is a great cd to listen to
B00821OX98|5|love this show , acting is good , effects are good , great entertainment would highly recommend to anyone that likes scifi or distopia movies
B0000028RR|4|Wow, I don't really like a whole lot of rapmetal, but this is pretty good stuff.  When I got this album, I never expected to like it, but I do.  Tom Morello is a great guitarist, good enough to give Jimi the Hendrix a run for his money.  He lends some really great solos, and rather weird effects.  I especially like the songs &quot;Bombtrack&quot;, &quot;Killing in the Name&quot;, and &quot;Settle for Nothing&quot;.  Some of the songs on here aren't anything special, but the good ones make up for it.  I don't really care much for the rapping, I would prefer more variety in the vocals, but it's surprisingly not that bad.  The political lyrics are excellent (stick it to the man!), I admire a band that's not afraid to speak their minds.  If you like rapmetal, buy this.  Also buy if you appreciate good guitar playing.  If you like this, you'd probably also like Biohazard.  And, Rage's other albums are okay too, but this here's the best.<br />Rage, baby, rage!
B002BWP49C|5|the disc works great no scratches so thank you compared to redbox rentals its works well so thank you again
B000QCS8TW|5|I began reading the series after years of watching the HBO series and was immensely entertained all over again, despite knowing the outcome. Superbly written, with descriptions so deftly spun that they paint vivid pictures for your imagination. Already purchased the second volume!
B0086700CM|5|I waited for this app on android for months. Finally it comes and temple run is incompatible with my htc hero. I blew a fuse. I wait for it to. come for amazon and boom!!!! My kindle fire can use it like a boss. Screw you android(just kidding I still love you)
B002VISNLC|5|A timeless classic that I enjoyed 30 years on when reading it to my children. It's dark and witty and still refreshingly un-saccharine.
B007J4T2G8|4|The story is very interesting but some of the content is disturbing. I applaud Annastasia at the end of the book. Could not wait to download next book.

B00CSR2J9I|5|Great game
B000WSHF4E|4|The sets, the costumes, the sheer beauty of the landscape is enough to earn this film a 5 star rating.  Parts of this film were so gloriously done they inspired the awe I feel looking at an illuminated text with the gorgeous gold leaf border and kid smooth binding.      Cate Blancett was stellar as an aging Queen Elizabeth, coping with the decline of her fertility while she still had to play the game of trying to find a suitable man to sit beside her on the throne.  Her wit dealing with Sir Walter Raleigh had everyone in the theatre laughing at one particular line regarding Raleigh's proposed name for his colony.  Her quandary over dealing with Mary, Queen of Scots was touching--what should she have done with a kinswoman and Queen.  Her leadership during war was inspiring.      I do not have sufficient scholarship in English history to comment on the verity of the romantic storyline with Sir Walter Raleigh. The general accounts are true, whether they were over-stated for film purposes or not should be determined by someone with more knowledge than I.    I will say the film was very worth attending and I'm glad to have seen it full screen in a theatre.  While modern home technology does do a fine job of rendering films--there's nothing to compare with a large-scale screen for the more gorgeously filmed movies.      I'm predicting at least a nomination for Blancett as Elizabeth as well as for the costumers, set designers and cinematographers.  This may well be a movie to buy when it comes out--particularly if you have the capability to really showcase this gorgeous film.

0399226907|5|I read this book as a kid, so when I found the toddler version (stick cardboard) I was really excited.
B00EV4EUT8|2|A Butler working through 7 presidents would have such an opportunity for insights into the presidency.  There would have been ample opportunity to come up with intriguing  details.  However, I was disappointed that there was hardly a notice of who was president much less what their policies were.  The film just wasn't what I expected.  The film was more about family relationships with the Butler's family and the unrest at the time concerning race relations.  The Butler's two sons were totally different.  One seemed bent on protest as a way of life and the other wanted to serve his country.  I found it especially sad when the younger son lost his life in Vietnam.
B00IIUATDM|5|Great movie if one can ignore the extreme profanity. F word is excessive. Probably broke a record for it's usage. It is rated R for a reason. It earned it.
B004JZBGWI|5|I'm glad its free. the best should be free..<br />I have it on all my devices. I know you all will like it too
B00005RRHC|5|This is one of the single best movies I have ever watched.  The writing is brilliant. The acting is fabulous.  Emma Thompson dropping her robe and telling Stephen Fry to \\"fill [her] with his babies\\" is one of my favorite cinematic moments of all time. I hope this comes out on dvd soon.
B00004WKII|5|Let me get down to business.. Whoever is rating this collection the lowest, is either loosing their hearing, or listen with 20yo equipment.  Yes it is true, small imperfection in quality that original recording suffers, but that's the point of it, even background noise is holy when Jimi plays.  Best sound source is non-digital which is absolutely STUNNING!!Analog puts your hearing in higher level that no digital can produce! Every time it is tweaked digitally, it looses that dimension.   Having said that, this collection is a Bible to the whole World when it comes to MUSIC.. Jimi was and is the greatest musician that ever walked on this planet, by a mile!! Hands that were touched by God, his heart and love that he infused into his guitar, permanently embedding soul, and love of music into our hearts. When he walked on the stage in Monterrey CA for the first time in front of American audience no one knew him, and after 45 minutes he became a legend. In the sixties music was very bubbly (just like the monkeys), bubblegum music, un-wild un-electric, un-creative. This guy comes along and absolutely shocks beyond belief. Its like sending a Ferrari back in time when Ford Model-T was taking of! He was so good that best musicians ever played from Rolling Stones, Beatles, The Who, Led zeppelin were his fans, to this very day.
B007TKT2SK|5|This is great! And it is so simple to use. VERY intuitive. Finally, a calculator that handles fractions! Not sure why it took so long.
B00TYB95I4|5|Really good movie!
B004SBQGHS|5|No real mystery why this game has gotten so popular, it is a great game that updates regularly with new content.
1592400876|5|This book is a joy! With today's use of technology, the internet, social networks and email have allowed many non-writers to write. Hence, writer, Lynn Truss does not give the everyday checklist or workbook to punctuation, she offers poignant literary and historical references of punctuation gone wrong! This book is an easy read with the voice of a story that can capture anyone that does not pay much attention to the detail of punctuation.
B003Z49LYO|4|THIS IS NOT A CUTE LOVE STORY!<br />if you want to be super depressed about life for a week, then please go ahead and watch this.<br />But if your looking for a super adorable old timy goopy ramance, dont watch.<br /><br />It does have amazing acting, the violin gets really old, but its all around a very well produced mini series... Its just extremly depressing.
B002RVCD6O|5|I know many don't like this movie but I think it was really well made. People underestimate just how much of a mess the books are at times.<br /><br />Question: Is the instant video the same as the ABC Family (with the extra scenes) or as the disc version?
B00BMKDTNC|5|A fantastic ending to one of the greatest series ever written.  WOW!  Brandon Sanderson did the author proud!
0316227706|5|Beautiful photography! Colorful, amazing! There are several dozen dogs featured of all varieties. The dogs look like little underwater aliens.I bought the book as a gift but decided to order another and keep one for myself.
B000000W5F|5|No other band has gone on for so long so well. Tattoo You is a monster effort. You would think the boys would be cranking out elevator music by now, but when this hit the shelves, you just knew the Stones were back in  major force. It's just a shame they went slowly downhill from here with the  inevitable aging process catching up.
B004LWZVZC|4|I purchased and streamed this Robert Redford film . I REALLY like the films Mr. Redford has directed . Particularly QUIZ SHOW and A RIVER RUNS THROUGH IT . This was an easy sell for me owing to the historical elements , it being a period picture and the fine cast . I've not read much history since my early twenties . Obviously , a lot of folks here know their history better than i , and/or dislike the film because Mr. Redford can get pretty preachy in some of his less highly regarded films . I can't speak to how accurate this film is or is not . I do think the average man or woman on the street might rather enjoy it though . See for yourself .
B00JCW0BCY|5|I'm going on 84.  I read this book with some hesitancy.  Would it frighten me with visions I don't<br />want to confront?  Why I said to myself do I need to deal with this now.  But I'm very glad I read<br />the book.  It's a tribute to a caring doctor who wrote it and a guide to what's possible in making<br />the ending of ones life worthwhile.  Yes even in your dying moments you can feel the value of many things.<br />Your love of family and friends, a reaffirmation of your lifetime values, maybe even the courage to<br />choose the best way of dying.  The author has considerable insight in mortality through years of<br />practice as a surgeon.  If thoughts of your mortality dance on the edge of your mind, read the book.
B00338QENI|5|5 stars doesn't even do this book justice!  One of the few books that I wished could be wiped completely from my memory so that I can read it and enjoy it for the first time all over again!!  This book is a must read!
B00QL0ST1K|1|I love soccer but I wasn't able to download it for some reason. As I was looking at the other reviews people had the same peoblem. I hope this comes to the designers attention soon. I would love to play but it seems not to download on the kindle fire hd generation seven. I have heard it doesn't work on the kindle fire HDX. I say give it a shot. I have downloaded mine now this is the 4th time I have tried. I'm not giving up!
B008RKI9O4|5|Funny, quirky and insightful with nice music.
B001U3Y5XE|3|My son loves legos so thought a good family game. Too pricey and trying to build something on the card very limited. We don't play too often as it gets old.
B001CLG6RC|5|Very fast delivey to Great Britian.  Well packaged and as described.  Many thanks for your custom.
0316286850|2|The book isn't what I thought it would be.I was sure it would be about applying makeup to the entire face. The book mainly focuses on the eyes... Really disappointed.
B004K7HMJ6|5|Love it.
B001HZK8FO|5|I ordered this from best buy and They messed up my order and send me the sd version and when I called them and said its not what I paid for they told me the movie in Blu ray is out of stock smh thanks for saving Christmas
0380789035|4|And it was. A really good read. Yes it lacked characterization of the \\"new\\" gods, but the gist of the plot really didn't have anything to do with their personalities. Or even the personalities of the \\"old\\" gods for that matter. This wasn't a novel written for characters. It was written, like so many of Gaimans books, for the moral idea.<br />It was a novel about how people's beliefs take form if they're strong enough, how society and life causes those beliefs to change and die, and how people casted off where they came from for where they went to. The war wasn't about a clash of gods, but a clash of ideals. And how one man gets to walk the path between the two.<br />I understand several people didn't like the book. They felt it was contrived, lacked character development, that the plot was rushed, and the ending unfulfilling. (But don't you find the final chapter interesting to say the least?)<br />For the what the book was meant to be about (ala Gullivers Travels), a reflection of the loss of native spirituality for the modern convinieces, I thought Gaiman did an admirable job. I would recommend this book to anyone who isn't into just reading for a fun story, but wants something to make them think as well.
B00003CXXJ|5|Excelent DVD quality and so great movie. The sounds and pictures are so great. The description of the product is very explicit in the page. This special edition is really special! <br /> <br />--------------------------------- <br /> <br />Exelente calidad de DVD y muy linda pelicula. Los sonidos y dibujos son excelentes tambien. La descripcion de la pelicula en la pagina es muy exacta. Estaq edicion especial es de verdad especial!
1416594787|5|Some of Dr Dawkin's works can be heavy going for those without a serious interest in his subjects.  This one is a much easier read.  With impressive style and clear and convincing explanations (for those who are open to them), Dawkins takes us on a fascinating journey through the evidence for evolution.  I think this should be required reading for every high school student
B00LP1MVSW|5|Very fun and passes time
0316743003|4|While the paperback edition is of rather cheap paper and print, the content and the corresponding price of the book more than makes up for it. It's Ben's first hand account of his years at Lochheed's Skunk Works, under the firm grip of Kelly Johnson and then as head of the Skunk Works, telling his personal view about the declassified programs (at the time of writing) he was involved in. The F-117 was Ben's brainchild, and the reader gets a priviledged insight into all the work that went into this remarkable airplane. While there are a few chapters where Ben takes the freedom to stray away from the main subject of this book, overall this cannot really detract from the very interesting story-line.<br />While this is not the definitive history of the Skunk Works, it will take the reader into a world not known to many, and it will not be easy for you to lay it down until finished - recommended.
B00QW8TYWO|5|VERY good app I LOVE it it's a great app<br />Trust me
1607066017|5|Another great beginning from Vaughn. I loved reading Y the last man and Runaways. Saga seems to be picking up right where they left off. Very original ideas and the artwork is outstanding. I can't wait for future issues.
B00BAXFACO|5|I thoroughly enjoy Michel Connelly books.  He has great characters………his stories are detailed, but not too much.  I am definitely a fan.
B0009A1AS2|5|When I can listen to a CD and break out in a huge grin, you know they have hit the spot.  Petrucci lays down some incredible guitar work, some of his best.  He has put much more thought into his solos on this one, compared to Train of Thought in my opinion. The man can go from some of the chunkiest chords to rippingly clear solos that are clean as a whistle.  I'm wetting myself! <br /> <br />Jordan Rudess is really getting hot too.  Also some interesting little noises here and there.  It's a musicians field day!  To the Crespo guy, that is bashing every DT CD since SFAM, as well as every other piece of music he reviews, I say go watch movies instead.  You apparently don't like this killer stuff, so don't buy it.
B00008K78M|5|I really enjoyed this concert, especially the lighting, sound,audience participation,and choice of songs.I am lucky enough to be able to understand most of the lyrics, having been raised Italian,and the guitar work of Gabriel Facini is impressive.He is equally at home on the acoustic and electric, and doesn't miss a note.Laura's voice is earthy and powerful as well.I'm looking forward to more concerts from this beautiful lady in the future.
B00005JO1Y|5|I was always a fan of King Kong, I have both versions on my collection the 1933 and 1976.  After I saw the new version, I'm convinced this is the best version ever.  Full of magnificent visual effects, very convincing.  I don't understand the complains some pleople have about the dinosaurs scenes.  The original version (1933) had dinosaurs too, in comparison with the new ones, the originals are very weak and even then I found them very cheesy.  The new dino scenes are magnificent full of action and adrenaline, very convincing and they add a lot more to the plot, than simply action.  They make you comprehend that this is an isolated island were prehistoric life was preserved in all its essence.  This new version has more thought put into it.   The new version did not include the pterosaurs the original had.  Pterosaurs migrate like birds do today, even though the island was isolated, they could fly and find humans in some other places.  It was very smart to change them for bats.  At least some bats do not migrate.  In general the movie is excellent and interesting, there had been longer boring movies that had even won an oscar, so I don't find any problem with the lenght of this movie.  The only complain I have was the first 45 minutes of the movie that try to develope the characters of the story.  This sequences lack of interest once in a while and do not add anything to the plot, maybe some editing here could've lessen the bad scoring some people did.  Even though, I watched 3 times this movie and came to my house and watched again and again the original and the 1976 versions and now I can say for the first time that the remake of a movie improved upon the original version.  Very few times you can say that!!!! Desperate waiting for the release of the DVD
B008UCJ7KO|5|Absolutely loved this third book. I can't wait for the 4th now! Great story with amazing character detail. I can't wait to see what happens next!
B002HJ9PTO|5|I have been searching for a lavalier mic for my Sony HANDICAM for well over a year, but just couldn't find one that fit my needs or my budget. Then I recalled that Gideon Shalwick used another version of this same mic when he started out making videos. I clicked on the one he had listed on his website, and it turned out to be the one I needed. Though it's not wireless, I only record my videos at home, and always close to the camera, and I have found a way to secure the 20' cord, yet keep it professional looking. This microphone is ready to use right of the box, and even includes an LR44 battery, which is easy to install. It's excellent for those on a budget starting out in making videos for YouTube. The audio in my videos now sound professional, and I don't ever see a need to invest in a wireless lav mic, unless I have reached the point where I wore it out!
B00821OX98|5|I think it's a great series, well done and not cheesy.  Maybe they'll air this one all the way through to completion.  I hate the way they always cut sci-fi series short.
B0010YSD7M|5|If your a SG1 fan and a collector of the season's series then this is a must have. The story is right on track with what you expect in action and adventure. I watch this on a Toshiba HD A-2 with the upconversion for regular DVD's and the picture quality is almost equal to HD quality.
B0008ENIAC|5|Excellent movie, excellent actors. Joan Crawford as Mildred Pierce is a classic. Ann Blythe plays the spoiled-rotten and ungrateful daughter, Veta. The new version with Kate Winslett and Morgan Turner as Veda is equally awesome. I don't know which one I like best.<br />Joan Crawford won an Academy Award for her portrayal of Mildred Pierce. I think Kate Winslett should also win an oscar for her performance. Based on a James M. Cain novel.
B004SBX112|5|Best Angry Birds so far, I really like the Halloween screens the best, but all the seasons are a lot of fun!!
B008JGSM6G|4|Great game--quick and challenging enough for waiting room or classroom.
B008FPOIT6|3|I liked the storytelling here, marrying old books with technology of today and the future.<br />Some great lines....<br />&#34;The suburban mind cannot comprehend the emergent complexity of a New York sidewalk.&#34;<br />&#34;Your life must be an open city, with all sorts of ways to wander in.&#34;
B0055QYKQO|5|I failed to do the proper research for my motherboard the first time around. So six months later I bought this to get the full 4GHz from my processor.
B00EMXBDMA|5|Great book!
B000002B7Y|3|Add one dose of Ozzy Osbourne, improved drumming from Randy Castillo, brilliant fireworks from new guitar wunderkind Zakk Wylde and steady bass from longtime Ozzy songwriting parter/studio bassist Bob Daisly and you get  a hard rocking, standard Ozzy Osbourne album. This album has several good  tracks-&quot;Miracle Man&quot;, &quot;Devil's Daughter&quot;, &quot;Blood  Bath in Paradise&quot; and &quot;Crazy Babies&quot;. The rest of the album  is standard hard rock. Zakk brings a fiery style to guitar that was lacking  in Jake E. Lee's style. Bob Daisly is a vast improvement over Phil Soussan  and Rudy Sarzo on bass. All in all this is a decent and well produced Rock  album with some catchy tunes. There is nothing amazing about this album,  just more of what you expect from Ozzy.
B002N5N5QQ|5|Because I couldn't have been any more satisfied than I am right now! Excellent! I have said everything I need to.
B00000J2KR|5|Visually stunning, deliberately paced story of a man who, despite his rise to riches and success,  finds himself rejected by the highest strata of society.  I suspect Kubrick was attracted to the story because of the  parallels to his own life.  Redmond Barry's story is much Kubrick's story.   After a initially brutal slap by the real world, the formally idealistic  young man becomes cynical and self serving, turning briefly to his own  tribe so far as he is 'helped' by them, but quickly rejecting them as soon  as becomes feasible to do so.  Taking a trophy wife from what he perceives  as the superior ruling class, he seeks acceptance in it, but soon realizes  the hopelessness of his ambition, and instead settles willingly to the  terms life offers.  He maintains his individual sense of honor in the face  of brutal bigotry and hollow hypocrisy, suspecting in himself a justified  self-worth, but always and forever doubting, seeing that his natural  tendencies are, in the end, inescapable.  The sets, costumes and cast are  excellent, but the real star is the film itself.  The film is long, but not  over long.  The viewer should give himself the time to absorb it; not only  does the film richly deserve it, but the viewer will be richly rewarded.
1401232590|5|Great story. Great art. This is definitely a must have for anyone building a Batman graphic novel library. The plot is a murder mystery but it is easy to follow, incorporates lots of characters without seeming stuffed, and has a great ending. I recommend this one 100%
B006LSZECO|5|This book was recommended to me but I lagged around reading it. Sorry I did. This book was great. The plot and characters were fascinating.
B0031RAOVY|5|Great family movie. Makes you want to hug your pet.
B000002UV9|5|This is a superb album - certainly one of the best I have ever heard. Of all albums I have heard in my life, this is only the 2nd or 3rd album in which ALL sings are really good. Superb vocals by Geoff Tate, great guitars by Chris DeGarmo, and superb balance of intense vocals and music in all tracks. A great variety of songs as well.<br />Don't even think about it - just go ahead and buy it !! If like me, you're an overly cautious type, who doesn't buy too many CDs, listen to the song previews and you'll be convinced. I was, and buying the CD is a decision which I'm really happy about.
B00D7Z4GQY|5|What a wonderful, heartbreaking, enjoyable book. The characters were amazingly written and I hated when it ended. Will definitely be reading more books by this author.
B004OZOTSQ|5|After a brief thought and trial of demo version, I finally Bought it for 99 Cents. And I think its a very good investment. Works flawlessly .Perfect thing for me. It allows you to transfer data between any wifi compatible device without need of internet. This was exact thing I was looking for. Moreover,It has a fantastic Graphical user Interface, both on my galaxy S4 and on my Laptop PC. Definitely go for it.<br />Thanks a lot to Developer.
B000XUBFE2|5|excellent story !
B0086700CM|5|I have always loved temple run and I couldn't wait for it to be on the kindle fire!!!!!!!!!!!!! I could  play for hours!!!!!!!!!!
B008IJTFYW|3|this doesn't relax me as well as I'd hoped but it's not too bad. I think it should have more soothing tones
0307361012|3|I originally read The Bat many years ago after it had been translated into Swedish and after reading later novels by Jo Nesbø, it was fairly easy to see why the publishing order was changed in the UK. Nesbø is not alone in having translated works published in this country in a different order, Sweden's Helene Tursten, Håhan Nesser, Henning Mankell, Camilla Läckberg among others as well as Norwayäs Anne Holt and Karin Fossum all have suffered similar alterations. First novels atre not often the best and for an author to make a decent breakthrough in a country where a translation has been required, it is often wiser for a publisher to allow several stories to be written before selecting the best to start the sereis in the UK.<br />The Bat reminded me alot of my times in Australia and seemed to describe Sydney fairly well, as it was back in the mid 90s anyway.<br />The Bat is a must have for anyone wanting a complete Harry Hole collection, but for others it is maybe one to miss.
B000006XSD|1|I had the original vinyl &quot;album&quot;. I could not believe that this was the same maestro that did Killer, Billion Dollar Babies, Schools Out, Nightmare and other great albums. This work, the theme were definitely not Coop type material.
B00074CBIS|5|Excellent service and merchandise.
B00B0LPWU6|5|This movie reminded me that amazing things can be done and that they can be done by extremely flawed people. This is a concept that we tend to reject because we want &#34;choir boy&#34; heroes and &#34;devil&#34; anti-heroes, comic book cutouts that run counter to reality. The director took his time to develop his characters so that we could fully understand their pathologies. It was this portrait of the clash between the inner self and the external actions that is the whole point of the movie. That and the concept that only in self-sacrifice can there be a measure of redemption.<br /><br />This movie is not fluff; it is the real deal. Watch it, only if you are ready to see some important truths.
B00GKKTZZU|5|I absolutely adore this book. This is one of her finest yet, and I'm so ready for the next book in line.
B001ACH4DS|2|david c. is a talented singer. it's too bad this album did not showcase that talent. the album is packed with alternative rock songs, which unfortunately, are forgettable. sure he can hit those high notes, but after a song or two, you would desperately ask for a breather. it could have been better, in my opinion, had they included more mellow tunes that david sang so well in american idol like \\"always be my baby\\"/\\"billie jean\\"/\\"first time ever i saw your face\\" or even \\"music of the night.\\" the only track i can listen to in this album is \\"time of my life.\\" i really got stressed out when i listened to the cd the very first time. i like alternative music but not david c's.
B0064MGU98|5|The only problem is trying to catch up from season one.  We are limiting ourselves to one episode a day after watching the first 7 on one Saturday afternoon.
B0057R5XRG|5|no issues
6305750750|3|I must admit the first time I saw the movie I was so hyped up with anticipation that all the movie could do was leave me with a feeling of disappointment. I am an avid follower of Star Wars and followed every move  of the pre-production notes. I decided to see the movie a second time and  enjoyed the film much more so than the first time.  Watch it once and you  miss a lot because things move so fast.  Watch it for a second or third  time and you begin to love it.  Despite the lack of character development  of Qui-Gon and Obi Wan, it definetely lives up to the Star Wars name.  The  only reason I give this movie 3-stars instead of 4 or 5 is because of  Anakin.  Put in a kid as the focus of a movie and you usually end up  disappointed by their lack of acting skills.  Episode II should prove much  better - the kid is grown up and you can focus more on the Dark Side.  Just  please don't ruin part II by casting Leonardo DiCaprio.
B00KF7VWBO|5|a great story and acting super
B00XWUQXJ2|5|Very interesting series. Acting is powerful. Real life issues an entanglements.
B0017QDH3S|5|Very intertaining.  I'm not a good speller or a pro movie reveiwer, but this movie had my atention all the way to the end.
B007ZGO7EM|5|I like using this app better than my calculator.  It's large &amp; easier to read for me as well as easy to use.  Tried a fancier calculator app &amp; did not like it.  Staying with this one &amp; would recommend it to others.
B0001XAPY2|5|This is now one of my favorite Studio Ghibli films. I did not think I would like it because of the cover, him being a pig and all. But these really teaches you the meaning behind &#34;Do not judge a book by its cover&#34; ...I enjoyed it so much that I watched it twice in a row and then again with my boyfriend. (I NEVER DO THAT) I warmed my heart and made me laugh so much. I think I even had tears in my eyes at one point. An excellent movie and terrific buy!
B000000OE7|5|...quite frankly, so depressing at times that you'll be wondering why you love it so much. Because this is one of Queen's best albums, probably my favourite one. Every single song is stunning - the vocals (mostly Freddie, singing with such incredible power and emotion that it's hard to believe the majority of these songs were recorded just months before his death) are amazing, the music is fabulous. Two songs Freddie recorded on his solo album, Mr Bad Guy, appear on this CD (Made In Heaven, I Was Born To Love You), and with added background material from Roger, Brian and John, they really do improve. Heaven For Everyone, which was originally a song by The Cross with Freddie on vocals, is reworked into a Queen song, and is one of their best. Too Much Love Will Kill You was released as a solo single for Brian in the early '90s, but the Queen version is pretty damn good too.<br />The rest of the album consists of rock ballads at their best. The emotional Mother Love, the gospel-esque Let Me Live, the upbeat My Life Has Been Saved, the achingly beautiful A Winter's Tale, the powerful It's A Beautiful Day... all are exceptional tracks. You Don't Fool Me is a much-looked-down-upon dance track, but one I happen to enjoy.<br />And really, it gets less melancholy the fiftieth time you hear it...
B00IKZX1ZI|1|AN other way of getting your money. I am stunned that people. will pay for a short thrill and get nothing for hard earned cash.
B00000JCOV|5|you are either 1. Not a &quot;real&quot; metal fan or 2. your not a metal fan, how can a person so intised in rap or pop or anything else rate something that is metal? SLIPKNOT rules, and is an outstanding metal band,  and for 9 members, this band is very nicley put together. I dont really  like the turn tables, but they fit in Slipknot's songs and are not really  noticable.<br />Metal is fast and heavy music, thats how Slipknot plays, and  this isnt hate music, this is happy music &gt;8-D. with happy sic people  ready to Mess you up. For any true metal fan, this is the album. The best  metal band out there.
B0055JP7EU|5|Can't believe we have to wait till after the summer before more episodes are released!   Wonderful cliff hangers!
B00G4EXNNM|5|My grandfather, Karl Davis, a musician on the WLS National Barndance in the 1930's wrote two of the songs on this CD.  'I'm Here To Get My Baby Out Of Jail' and 'Kentucky'.  Billy Joe Armstrong and Norah Jones do wonderful versions of these songs and all of the songs on this CD!  No fancy production, just pure, clean instrumentation and beautiful vocal harmonies. Thanks Billy Joe and Norah for bringing this great and classic music back to life!
B003L77FYS|5|I love the inter action between the characters and the way the writers keep the story fresh through the series.
B00C7TAF3Y|4|Absolutely loved this game. Very interesting and really makes you think about how to get to the next area. I would say I am about 3/4 the way through but am really stuck and the clues are very vague. Put it down for a few days and will definately go back and maybe with a fresh look will be able to complete. Almost downloaded the &#34;cheat&#34; book but hoping I can do it without that. Great challenging game that gives great brain excercise.
0756688701|3|I got this for my son who is really into Disney Cars as a 2014 Christmas gift.  It's a cool book that shows all the characters, but seems like it is written more for collectors as it says what year each edition came out, how rare they are, etc..  I was hoping more for a yearbook sort of list of all of the characters.  Since it's slanted more toward when each edition was released, the fact that it was published several years ago means that it's sort of out of date and not as exciting to read.  My son still enjoys looking at all the pictures though.
B008133MDK|3|This time it seems over worked and unnecessarily convoluted. It is Interesting but not great. Doctor Watson<br />is excellent and all the acting is good. You need a new writer.
B0001EFTVA|5|Now, there's nothing like seeing a film which you have no idea what it is, about, or anything like that and then bowled over by how great it is.  This is one of those films, and come to think of it even if I had some forewarning it still would've suprised me, becuase this anime covers so much. <br /> <br />Still though, to give you heads up this story is about three homeless people: a upper middle age man, a young girl recently runaway, and a transvestite.  Now, right of the bat the movie should seem interesting, but probably plot less.  However, the story picks up when the three discover a baby and, over very little time, their fate somewhat becomes intwined with it's fate.   <br /> <br />See strange, right?  Somehow though, the ecclectic characters and the Holiday theme keeps it all together.  Through laughs, of which there are a plenty, and even some tough times the movie will keep you latched in.  And why not, the characters could be the start of a joke all on their own; this is true.  However, this movie is no joke.  Instead, it is probably one of the best animes (not relating to machines and robots) that I've seen yet.
B00005NOOH|5|Factual, unbiased, bursting with rich historical detail, beautifully directed and peerlessly narrated by Sir Laurence Olivier; this is the definitive WW2 documentary series. Made in the 1970s it contains many, many excellent interviews with people from both sides who actually took part in he war which provide superb insight into the events being documented. The World At War is a long series but necessarily so - no consideration is missed during the course of its many hours which deliver coverage of the build-up to war, the execution of the war and its aftermath in terms of its effect on both military and civilian populations and from the perspective of all the major participant nations in both political and military terms. Not merely excellent in content, The World At War is also a flawlessly crafted piece of television - images and sound (allowing for its date of production and the inclusion of many archive clips) are excellent as are the score, script and narration - Laurence Olivier really does do a great job.  To conclude - I can not recommend The World At War enough. If you are interested in the genre or a student of 20th century history then you should buy it: you will not regret it. If you consider the hours-of-viewing to price ratio it is also pretty good value to..
B00ADS98FC|5|Seriously, my favorite movie!
1593275080|5|This is a well done Lego book. The creations featured are perfect examples of adult built models, as most (if not all) do not include any mini figured themed builds. It has a diverse collection of sculptural builds of everyday things, such as food, animals, and vehicles, as well as big and small architecture builds with themes ranging from realistic to pure imagination. The level of detail within the builds allows you to look over it again and again and pick up something new each time. And despite the variety of builds and inclusion of many different builders and styles, everything is cohesive and beautifully laid out. It's the perfect coffee table book, as both kids and adults will be wowed by the content.<br /><br />*I received a copy for review - all opinions are my own*
0062252747|2|Disappointing- nothing new- I feel like it's written for women that hove no idea about health and fitness... If so then it's good for them.<br />2 star because it will make a good coffee table book - for any guests you may have
B000TXR1GO|5|You know those people who are just smart enough to have opinions and feel the need to force them down your throat? Well here we have another one. Whether it be Mr Bourdain's constant quoting of famous figures (Yes, we get it. You are well read and smart) or the way he looks on everything with disdain, the snooty and holier than thou attitude comes through in his writing. Yes, it is funny, but it makes me resent the fact that a schmuck like him can become rich and famous.. subsequently leaving his wife for a younger more attractive woman......
B005ZOBNOI|4|This was a very good book..the author did a good job keeping us guessing.i would recommend it to all my daughters, daughter-in-laws, and granddaughters!
B00632HWOG|5|Only problem I had was I wish it were easier to delete messages but other wise this is a really good app that's easy to work with
B007ZGIPAO|5|This is a fun way to play one of my favorite games. Easy and great graphics.<br />Addicting...but a great way to pass the lunch time!
B003JTHXOK|5|I read this book before going to see the movie of the same name. It was a delightful romance, nicely colored by a little supernatural angel activity. Who knows?  Maybe the angel was real!
B0054SMIH6|4|I READ THE BOOK FIRST SO I KNEW THE PLOT.  I DIDN'T THINK IT WAS AS CLEAR IN THE MOVIE.  I DID ENJOY THE MOVIE AND THAT IS WHY I BOUGHT MY OWN COPY.
B000O8OTNC|4|I didn't expect this little sharpener to work as well as it does.  Well worth the money, buy it you won't be sorry.
0345495004|4|I liked this book as the fictionalized sections had to do with feelings, emotions, and conversations rather than wholesale rewriting of events. The true story is gripping, and the book is well-written and builds up a good head of steam towards the ending. If you are a Frank Lloyd Wright fan you will want to read it; if you aren't familiar with him or his story it still makes good chick lit.
B00FOWX6NM|5|Everyone keeps asking me where I got the case. The case really covers all the edges and corners really well while maintaining a light weight feel. The unique design on the back is a bonus. Would buy another if I had to!
B00NAKWUGY|3|the record was in good shape but skips occasionally.
B0032JTV6U|4|Love this season!  The only complaint I have is that the episodes were spread out into too many DVDs.  It could have just been on about 4 DVDs and a bonus DVD.  Other wise, awesome. =)
B00AO2P3GA|5|The game is amazing. The multiplayer is very competitive and fun. Try getting a kindle and putting this on your points for kindle. it's overall graphics and that crap is awesome. This game is worth every penny
B0054JZC6E|5|awsome. best game on the fire. could play it all day long. only thing that could make it better is more games.
B009F7OUQE|5|amazing quick shipping :) love love love it :)
B00CGNYDIE|4|A lot more fun than I expected! Very re-playable, the controls are a tad easy to hit the wrong thing on, but otherwise an addictive, fun and thought-provoking game! I will probably buy more of these from the company.
B00AREIAI8|5|So much fun I just hope they give you enough tasks to keep the gems and coins rolling in. Oliver  the movement  of the horses too very life like
B00BZB7OMA|5|The Neighbourhood's &#34;I Love You&#34; was one of my favorite albums in 2013 and it took Sony almost two years to drop a vinyl release. I don't know why the product description is so short, but here's what this album comes with:<br /><br />It's two 180-gram vinyls in white sleeves with a coupon to download the digital album.<br /><br />Side A:<br />How<br />*Afraid<br /><br />Side B:<br />Everybody's Watching Me (Uh Oh)<br />*Sweater Weather<br />*Let It Go<br /><br />Side C:<br />Alleyways<br />W.D.Y.W.F.M?<br />Flawless<br /><br />Side D:<br />*Female Robbery<br />Staying Up<br />Float<br /><br />Note: *Radio singles
B009UX2YAC|4|It's a great game. Me and my friend love to play this game bcuz it's so much fun .thank you
B00KWVZ750|5|He'll ya love the game  stalls some times need all little more updates but fun to play anytime time of day
B00005614M|5|It was during the 1940s that Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie were responsible for the bebop evolution/revolution that changed jazz forever. As that decade ended, Miles Davis (formerly from Parker's band) founded one of the two distinct styles that resulted from the &quot;splitting&quot; of bebop - the other, of course, was hard-bop. With this recording, Miles showed the world what &quot;cool&quot; jazz was supposed to be. The contributions of Gil Evans and Gerry Mulligan were absolutely essential to that, and the final result was this album filled with astounding compositions and marvelous arrangements. (Kenny Hagwood's singing in &quot;Darn That Dream&quot; sounds pretty odd, though. I guess Johnny Hartman wasn't in town. A pity.) The fact that Miles Davis, who &quot;created&quot; cool jazz, also became a major hard-bop star is not ironic at all: that's just how complete his talent was.
B0089LOG02|5|Great Book! Easy and interesting read. I loved the Molly character and her mentor. I thought the history of the orphan trains were spot on. I recommend this book.
B005XQLBU4|4|It's a fun game that is great for killing time.
B000W7JWUA|5|The board game of all board games, it is evidence of modern-day progress. The simplest analogy for the game's premise: where in Risk you take over the world through military might, in Settlers of Catan you take over through economic prowess. Involved are: trading, luck (from the die), strategy, and wisdom with money.<br />Initially the game is for up to four players, and you build settlements, cities, and streets to earn points. The first player to reach the point value wins. Each settlement, city, or streets requires resource cards (Wood, Sheep, Wheat, Clay, and Stone) to buy, and you gain resource cards by building a settlement near a resource on the map (which has a number on it) and the die must role your number. It's a simple premise, learned in 10 minutes of playing, so even some children can play along--although there are children's editions to the game.<br />I bought Settlers of Catan in Germany about five years ago and have played it regularly EVER SINCE. In addition to purchasable fifth and sixth players, three expansions were developed to make the game continually exciting and interesting. Whenever I move to college or to home or to a travel for a while in a different country, I bring Settlers of Catan. You MUST acquire this game for a well-rounded life.
B00FAX6XQC|1|Downloaded it twice, both times it had errors and would not run.  Don't have time to fool with programs that don't work.
B004HW7JMY|5|awesome series just wished they made more....
B00FAPF5U0|5|Candy Crush SAGA is one of the best games I've purchased! One can play lackadaisical and just move up the levels; or play with great thought and go for score. There are actually two games (that I've found so far!). The cost is really dependent upon what you want to spend, and the variety and boosters are great!
B00992CF6W|5|You should buy it to!
B004U9J9GS|5|Best avoided before lunch, it will make really hungry.<br />Shares a deep love for real cooking and real food - no foam microdoses here.
B008Y1YK9Y|5|Whole family enjoyed it.
B008Y720JU|4|This movie was fun, not too heavy and enjoyable.  Not exactly a realistic scenario, but I think that's the point.  It's more about faith, hope and the power they can weild. It was the feel-good flick I was looking for, if a bit moody and dark at times.
B004VMUS9G|5|There is nothing more relaxing than waking up to music and with this app and panora I escape into another world. And I use the timer when I jog.and the price is right! Works great on my kindle fire so go for it! And close your eyes listen to the sounds at sunset and sunrise!
B00KF7VWBO|5|raw but good
B00OQWWBBE|5|Always love this movie! It's great! It's a classic for its time!
B006LSZECO|5|An evil twisted plot that keeps you guessing.  Prepare to be hooked and want to read it all in one day. I can't wait for the movie to be released.
B0094K1WZE|5|This was the best of the MI series. Excellent special effects but not overdone like so many movies these days. Excellent cast and dialogue. Tom Cruise and his three sidekicks were great.
B00CJ4OMO0|5|One of the great biopics of all time.  It's as entertaining and relevant as ever.  It should be on everyone's 10 &#34;must seem&#34; movie list.
B00GINENG0|1|Well in some ways it's stupid.why don't you let kids make an app they now what's best besides it's not that good<br />And you can slap him what kind of influence is that!?
B00B99QTM4|4|Funny interesting nostalgia
B00DZ83IPS|4|Good action movie.
B0063M22QO|4|I love this game. I am so glad it's lava on my kindle fire hd. Now I can play this game when ever I want to.
B00000IL1K|5|This album was by far Sarah Brightman's most amazing works. She has a very eccetic selection and does amazing work on these songs.
B0092FNLM8|5|Love that this story has a little girl branching out of the same old fairytale story! Would recommend for any little &#34;princesses&#34;
B00PJ5AUCO|5|It's terrific, note on the terrifying part
B001TCHDPS|5|I watched the movie &#34;Searching for Sugarman&#34; and was immediately on Amazon purchasing the albums.  There are two originals and one compilation from the movie.  What an amazing story and music.  You have to watch the DVD.
B008Z9YLV2|3|It was ok; don't know what all the hoopla is about.  Not crazy about teens and children killing each other.
B000089CJI|4|soft yet tricky like Death Cab for Cuties. its like The Smiths gone  Strawberry Switchblade gone Gameboy music.
B000SINT52|5|An amazing movie, that was a real eye opener.  The only issue I had with it was how bummed out it made me.
B002QKZLZ6|5|Very well-made and aesthetically pleasing case.  Nice and sturdy.  Although the fit is a bit snug (but I have only had it for a week - I'm guessing it will eventually soften a bit), but I'm very glad I bought it, as my previous headsets end up retired by looking so banged up as opposed to outliving their usefulness.  I normally leae them laying around in the car or on my desk.  Given the price if the Voyager Pro+, this holster is well-deserved.  I think they could have engineered it a bit smaller, but at least it will be hard to lose it.  Also lets me trade off between the headset and the stereo headphones without having them scattered all over the car.  Definitely recommend it.
B003WUYRGI|5|A tome of excellence. If it was followed by a thesaurus of equal standing it would save much shelf space.
B000E1ZBGS|1|This adaptation is quite disappointing.  I am a great fan of Jane Austen's work and this version is so drab and the actor's portrayals are unconvincing and boring. <br />  <br />The A&E version with Colin Firth & Jennifer Ehle is far superior.
B0002Y4T92|5|good stuff
0060558121|5|The United States of America has been traditionally considered one of the most diverse places to find a large gathering of cultures.  Long before the British established the first colonies, many immigrants brought their customs and beliefs to the new world.  In American Gods, Neil Gaiman delves into these traditional beliefs and the folklore that surrounds them.  Along the way, he takes a look at the twenty-first century ideologies that have replaced these older traditions.<br /><br />Gaiman's protagonist, Shadow, begins the novel a week before his release from prison on unspecified charges.  Shadow plans to return to his wife and job working for who his best friend.  However, his plans are sidetracked when he meets a mysterious man on a plane ride home.  This man, whom calls himself Mr. Wednesday, tells Shadow of a secret war that consist of gods, whose believers have settled across the United States at one time or another, and the \\"up-and-coming gods\\" who are vying for the minds of citizens.<br /><br />In Gaiman's America, once the gods arrive, they remain, growing weaker as their believers die out or turn to other deities or beliefs, also known as henotheism.  Along the way, Shadow encounters gods from Norse, Egyptian, Chinese, Native American, and African religions.  Although there are many gods and goddesses in the novel, it must be said that this is not a religious books by any stretch of the imagination.  Instead, he focuses on the beliefs of Americans, who, in his opinion, seem to be turning their backs on traditional gods to make room in their lives for more modern philosophies. Furthermore, Gaiman, through certain social commentaries, shows how Americans have grown to comfortable with commerce, technology and communication.<br /><br />Locations are just as important to the novel as the characters are.  What is interesting is how little occurs on the coasts of America.  To Gaiman, the heartland of America seems to be where the core belief in religions still exist, a belief that had little to do with the Bible Belt which crosses the path his characters travel.<br /><br />By focusing his attention on the older gods, Gaiman gives his novel a very dark atmosphere.  These are gods who, for all the glorious stories that have been handed down about them, revel in the idea of battle and yearn for blood, in addition to, sacrifices being made to them.  Although not apparent without thoroughly reading the novel, these gods embody the best of traditional values, as well as, the worst.<br /><br />Gaiman's descriptions and use of language is nothing short of lyrical.  It brings to mind the very epics and legends, which encapsulate the doings of the gods he depicts. His America is intriguing as good co-exists with evil, peace with war.<br /><br />American Gods is a novel of intricate ideas that are presented smoothly and imaginatively.  Neil Gaiman examines not only the system of belief in America, but also the dark underside of America, which American's would prefer to remain hidden from view.  His characters are interesting and well developed, with few of them being what they appear to be at first glance.

B009R659L8|3|I love Mary Higgins Clark's books and read them the minute they are available. This was my least favorite of her books. There was no depth and no excitement for me. Interesting story and lots of characters to figure out.
B00MI56SIS|5|Great for schools
B000FQIRXQ|5|My purchase of this movie was a good choice. It arrived quickly and in excellent condition. This version of David Copperfield  is true to Charles Dickens' book. The powerful emotions of each character, not to mention the likeability (or hateability?) of the characters  makes this movie a moving and great choice for any buyer.
B0052RDHTM|1|Read the one that comes just before this and save your time and money; do not buy this.
B008OOYALE|5|Lots of things to do, you will find that the different types of dragons each have their own unique qualities
B003TSEEDY|5|All throughout the book, you tend to wonder who this \\"friend\\" is reading the letters from Charlie. I kept thinking that we, as readers, would soon find out. But it turns out, Charlie was just looking for someone who would listen... And he found me.
B0063GORYU|5|I love to play solitary it's one of my favorite games I play a lot and your game is the best thank you. Sharon
B000QRIGLC|5|Well written filled with laughter and suspense. It keeps you on the edge of your seat. Its definitely for those who like war and suspense.
B0002ZYE1Y|5|Every track is awesome on this record. Nightwish hits a homerun with this metal masterpiece. Ghost Love Score is a must listen. get this record in your collection
B0049J0DC8|5|One of my faviorite movies growing up, I decided to  rent it and see what my 2 year old nephew and 2 & 4 year old nieces thought.. they LOVED IT!.. they watched it over and over and over!..
B0078X2LKY|4|I bought this book for my son on the kindle fire after my sister showed me it on her ipad. The ipad version reads it to you and has you press points on the tablet, my son loved it. This one is just the book.<br /><br />It's still a good book, just wish I could find some like my sister has on her ipad for my kindle fire.
B00QROI70S|5|HD quality was great!  Movie was awesome!! Love it!!
B00OIIXD9U|5|Best English learning guidelines, very helpful!
B00JVZ0DQG|4|Love playing the game, but there are some glitches. I don't always get keys when I earn them. Watching some of the videos for instance, doesn't give me the claim prize button, therefore no key received
B00785P2QC|5|Game is easy to play. Just can't wait for more money to expand your city. But u can get hooked. You DON'T have to spend a lot of money if u are patient and make it on your own.
0385338732|4|This was simply a fun book for a cold night. The characters draw you in, especially Jon and Lexi. So if you're looking for an enjoyable read, try this one!
B001NLL8LA|4|I love the way Jack just drifts into troubled lives, solves the complicated issues and disappears.
B00005176F|4|Look, its a great cd, dont get me wrong. Its full of classics and sing alongs and shows that Blur have been one of the great bands of the 90s in England, but england only. It lacks something, something hard and more edgy, something an album like Supergrass or Oasis could produce. But, if you like Blur, or the Whoo Hoo boys as known in America, this is a fine collaberation of the last 10 years of music. Certainly something better than any american pop band could produce today.
B005PK56TA|5|Jessica Lange is brilliant!! Such a captivating show. Once you start you cannot stop watching. Watched over two nights and them slept with a light on!
B0014NDXGA|5|Selected the Bushnell tour v2 over the Callaway model and couldn't be happier with the Bushnell.  I like focusing on creeks and traps to get the distance to those hazards as well as pins.  Or, I pick a spot in front of the green for a layup shot and get that distance--no more second guessing the distance during the back swing!
B0053TMP24|5|The writer is great. I first started reading them when I worked at a machine shop while running a laser. I was immediately hooked and set out to get the rest of them including this one.
B00HDMMISA|5|I loved every part of this book. Each characteristics into the story perfectly. You can relate to each person and their dilemmas. There were moments I would stop and think about what I would do in their shoes.<br />Would I recommend this book? Most definitely!
0792110188|5|very good
0307474275|5|While growing up I HATED reading books. Then one day Mr. Brown writes this book. This book literally changed my life. Not that it was the best book ever but, this book made me love books. I've been reading books ever since. True life story.
B00FAVRHBE|5|This movie is AWESOME!
B005PK56TA|1|It was gratuitously violent. Not recommended.
B00000IAU3|3|This a nice record for people who want their music to be background music.  With the exception of a couple songs, this record isn't particularly engaging.  I strongly suspect the next Dido album with sound exactly like this one as she seems to only have one or two musical ideas.<br />Don't get me wrong, the CD is pleasant enough.  But I've heard it all before.
B007FG9LIE|5|Excellent! I couldn't put it down!
B007ZGO7EM|5|Use everyday. Love the history feature.
B000SW4DLM|5|Great movie.
0316017930|5|This book is interesting. Gives a lot of insight into what makes a person brilliant in their field. Started reading for school, but ended up really enjoying it.
B008Y6WRIA|3|This is a re-make of a Japanese original​, the original was better
B00GRVV29E|4|Once I got started I had a hard time putting it down. The variety of images you can make is endless. Will keep you from doing what you should be doing instead! Like homework! I got it when it was free app for the day. But even for $2.00 it is still worth it.
B00FAPF5U0|5|It's a very addicting game I play this game over and over again
B000VMFDW2|4|Truly a classic.  Any study of war is incomplete without reading Sledge's accounts.  Rightfully on the USMC Commandant's reading list!
0375704027|3|I guess it is well written, but not sure what the point was
B0084BMUFA|5|The the story.  And having it on the kindle, makes it easy to switch to the narrative. Even if you don't have the audio version.
B00006CXSS|5|After viewing last year the HBO special on the Dish Network I was moved by the film. My father was in the Canadian Army During WWII and although he is no longer with us..I can now really appreciate what they all did for us from every country. Band of Brothers made me cry and feel what my father went through. It was an emotional roller coaster that made me proud of what they all did. This story is excellent and so is the video which I purchased along with the book earlier this year. I also just purchased this DVD set.
B00IIUATDM|5|Great movie
B000AAF1U4|5|Probably one of the ONLY Disney movies that isn't a full-on musical! I'm an adult and love this movie! Still cracks me up every time I watch it! A great 'pick-me-up' for all kinds of blues!
B006LSZECO|5|Great book!!!!
B0034JKZ86|5|Perfect. No scratches. Fast delivery.
B0064MGU98|5|i just couldn't find enough episode&#34;s of this........&#34; The Good Wife &#34; !<br />Brilliant- insightful  intriguing,<br />.one season after another.<br />and played out wel<br />l,i was up till 3 am 3 nights in a row watching every episode,i didn't want to put it down.!
B000002GW5|5|Great album from JB was somehow never purchased in my youth! I wanted the physical disc so I could link The Load Out & Stay into one track; something you just can't do by purchasing mp3 files!
B00H455UKE|4|UPDATED: They've Fixed it with an update!  It now shows best time and progress to the next level. Thanks.  I've bumped my rating up to four stars!<br /><br />I'm playing this on a Kindle Fire. It's fun, easy, and the tips are nice. Controls are simple. I've gotten through the first level and played the second level several times. I agree with the other reviewers that it should do something after you finish a race, but telling it to start a new race is easy by using the menu button upper right corner of the screen. Maybe they missed it.<br /><br />What frustrated me is that it doesn't seem to be recording the race results. It shows N/A where best time should be. There is some fractional experience rating it's calculating, but I don't know how close I am to opening the next level. Fix this and you've got a 4 or 5 star game.
B006LSZECO|4|Great book but the end wasn't my fav.
B007J4T2G8|1|Awful.
B00EFWU91E|5|Can't get enough from this author!  Every book in this series has been a page turner with not much down time.  I will be reading anything Cassandra Clare writes.
B00BAXFECK|5|Much longer read than my usual book but I am so glad that I read it.  Amazing!  You never see what's coming next.
B002EWANQS|1|I was very excited when this electric mocha pot arrived, But so disappointed in this product. The exterior became so hot I actually burned myself pouring the coffee. It was quite expensive, close to $100, I expected better quality! And was not sealed properly so when I poured the coffee it leaked out of the seam. also the plug was so loose it fell out of the socket.What a disaster!!!! I do not recommend this product!!!!
B004LUS390|5|This app is sic! The control on this app is amazing! To have this offered free is awesome. All Creatives out there should have this on their smart phones!
B0014QABX0|5|Great cd have been looking for the right one for a long time that had a song I love.Did not know from which cd it was on,love the<br />whole cd
B007ZD17XO|5|I am so addictive to this game I can not put it down. If you challenge &amp; fun here u go.  A.Malloy CA.
B000005H7D|5|This CD is amazing. I love to listen to it; it has some of my favorite solos of all time. Most people tend to applaud Coltrane's playing on this album, since he was the leader, but I personally am much more impressed  with Lee Morgan's. The young trumpet player really shows his talent here. I  especially love his break on Locomotion. If you buy this version and not  the regular Blue Train, make sure you put it in your computer; there's a  lot of great stuff, from clips of people talking about Coltrane to a video  of Coltrane and Miles playing So What. I strongly reccommend this CD to any  jazz fan; if you don't have it then your collection is really suffering.

B003G4W49C|5|Addicting read!  I've read several of the other books in this series.  The Mormon bias comes through in a few places, but still worth reading.  Brings up interesting ethical questions about artificial intelligence.  I was disappointed to find, after reading the books, that the author has a history of homophobia.  No bueno!
B00005LK94|5|In the world of DVD, it is quite fashionable to talk about &quot;must-have&quot; DVDs, mostly because of the disks' technological superiority. But the Special Edition DVD of Fly Away Home is a disk that does genuinely belong in every movie lover's collection. The disk is full of extras and is beautifully rendered, but it is the film itself that makes this DVD a true must-have. Fly Away Home tells the kind of story that could oh-so-easily become sentimental or melodramatic. &quot;Young teenage girl loses her mother in a car accident and goes to live with her estranged father. They learn to connect to each other, and to their own hearts, by teaching a flock of orphaned wild geese to fly.&quot; But make no mistake: this film is a first-rate family classic. It's the kind of movie that you cannot stop watching. The acting is honest and understated; the cinematography is superb (just about every single shot in this film could be put up on the wall, that's how beautiful the pictures are); the music is spot-on, moving from romantic to quirky moods with grace and ease; and Carroll Ballard's direction is just perfection, simply because you never notice it: he lets the story tell itself in images, in all its simplicity and beauty -- only at the end do you stop to realize that, oh yes, someone must have directed this film. And then there's the geese, the real stars of the film. Every time you see them take to the sky in this film's gloriously beautiful sequences, following Amy in her flying machine, they tell us the simplest and most profound of thuths: that this world is beautiful, and that we must not let it go to waste. In an age when movies seem to be mostly about machines, explosions and violence, Fly Away Home comes as an eloquent reminder of what really matters: that we take good care of the people that we love, and that we must never lose the courage to dream.

B00DHKKN6Q|5|this is a cute little game. I think the dragon is simply adorable. Hitting the egg to release the pup is a cute added strategy.
B00KA87GCW|3|I like how I don't need my Facebook friends to play this game, though I would prefer not having to use ask other people for help in quests in general. I don't like how long it takes to generate money without paying for it as well as the limitations on how many buildings I can have. Also why is the well, which is under decorations, considered a building?<br />On a positive note I like that I have more than one helper without having to pay for them.

B000009DUY|4|John Williams' score for &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; has less of an ability to stand on its own than any other collaboration of the celebrated composer and director Steven Spielberg.  This is primarily because the Spielberg movie, with its devastating opening scenes of the assault on Omaha Beach on D-Day (sixty years ago today), does not use musical underscoring for the action sequence: as the picture changes from the eyes of the old James Patrick Ryan &quot;Revisiting Normandy&quot; to the young Captain Miller about to hit the beach, the music ends and does not pick up again until Miller's eyes take in the view of &quot;Omaha Beach.&quot;  This is totally appropriate for making the film effective because it is the memorable images and the sounds of battle that are compelling, not the music.  However, this means that as a listening experience the soundtrack for &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; is somewhat devoid of the emotional resonance that makes the film unforgettable.  The music is not really associated with what we remember from the film and which we experience every time we watch it (I know I am not the only one who spent today watching the film).<br />The exception that proves the rule, of course, is the opening track, &quot;Hymn to the Fallen,&quot; which is the musical highpoint of the album and gets reprised at the end of the album.  Between those two tracks this is a somber musical score and it will take you a while to be able to recognize the individual tracks between the two hymns as being distinct pieces of music.  Again, this is not to say that this approach is inappropriate, just that the music enhances the images and without the images the music is lacking. The sense of peacefulness of the music represents the quiet before the storm, providing temporary respite from the horrors of war.  This was the score that Spielberg requested for his film, and the best way to enjoy the music is to listen to it in the context of the film where it performs its function.  Except for the opening and closing credits there is no moment where the music really commands our attention more than the images.  That is not usually the case with Williams' music (I still have not listened to any other orchestral score as much as I did the original &quot;Star Wars&quot; double-album), which is why this one has such a unique place in his distinguished career.  It makes perfect sense to me that this score was nominated for an Academy Award but did not earn Williams his sixth Oscar.ts function.

B00I8H7APK|4|Cute romance if you are in to those types of movies. I am not in to these types of movies usually but I did enjoy this one.
B00005JNEI|5|I admit that before watching this movie I thought it would be a boring documentary with no real point but to bore on about useless information and facts with no real emotion or humour, rather robotic to be honest however this movie came across as funny and rather frightening. We all know Michael Moore as the big guy from \\"Bowling For Columbine\\", yet on this movie with all the controversy surrounding it he affirms himself as a wonderful director and comedian. Now you may have thought he had no real connection to 9/11, however one of his colleagues was killed in the WTC disaster. All the more reason to bash Bush and create one of the more revealing and controversial movies of 2004.<br /><br />This movie exposes some shocking truths about the Bush administration and how they reacted to 9/11. It leaves some questions for the viewers to answer themselves though it answers lots of questions many Americans were just too afraid to ask.<br /><br />Did President Bush really win the 2000 election?<br /><br />-That is really one of the points that you have to decide for yourself, however you are given lots of evidence. Fox may have actually decided the fate of that election. All the other news organisations apart from Fox called Florida in favour of Al Gore thus supposedly handing him the presidency, however when Fox called Florida in the favour of Bush the other channels followed suit and Bush won the elction, however the person that called Florida in favour of Bush was actually his first cousin.<br /><br />Michael Moore's profile of a woman from his home-town was simply breathtaking. Lila Lipscomb from Flint, Michigan is profiled in the film because her son is in Iraq fighting. Then she finds out that her son has died and she goes to Washington and to the outside of the White House. Her portrayal is amazing.<br /><br />This movie has made me wonder how on earth he won a second term in office and makes me come to respect life even more. After watching this movie you will be hopefully the wiser and not vote to keep him in office if he run for a third term or more!will be hopefully the wiser and not vote to keep him in office if he run for a third term or more! <br /> <br />
B001SO6KMY|4|Though most of the movie is fictional, it does a great job representing Chinese Gung Fu, and the many variations of styles and philosophies, particularly Wing Chun Kung Fu.
B007J4T2G8|1|Terrible.  It's now a movie. Go figure.
0811875539|5|Not much you can say here.  Andrew Zuckerman's work is always stunning... I only hope that one day he releases a book showing the behind the scenes of these amazing shots!
B00FN8FCO8|4|One of korns best albums. Very enjoyable. The lyrics are quite political at times, It's a break from the usual depressing lyrics.
B00479SVBU|4|Great reception. Impressed. Only complaint is the orientation of the DC adapter barely fits into the compartment tray where the receptacle is located in my 2004 Mazda 6. Needs longer cord too.
B00004KD1L|4|I own this album simply due to the fact that &quot;At The River&quot; appears on it. as for the rest of the tracks, well, some of them are great (&quot;Dusk You &amp; I&quot;, &quot;If Everybody Looked The Same&quot;, to name a few), but others - particularly &quot;I See You Baby&quot; - are mildly annoying. If you have to have a reason to buy this album it would be &quot;At The River&quot;. It is seduction at its purest form. I haven't met any guy who did not appreciate this track on tapes (or CDs) I've made for them... especially in those special moments when the CD's supposed to be played *wink wink*.
B00HQLF35I|5|one of the best movies  I have seen.  it amazes me how the crew had no weapons for protection.<br />called in the best (navy seals)
B001C4CI8U|5|After watching the second season on TV, I am hooked on this show and really appreciated how the first season tied all the plots together. The price is a bargin.
B00CHIMG6Y|3|This family was brave, but the film turned corny and unrealistic at the reunion.  Also i can't believe they treated the other separated family so inconsiderately, yet a movie was still made about their experience.  I feel disgusted.
B00FRQ32N4|5|I think it is good because you can do the draw thing and get robots. That's how I got Midas!!!
B000063CPL|5|The best live peformance that I have ever heard.  Iron Maiden proved with Brave New World that they could still rock and now with this cd they have proved that they can live up all the bring the house down.  Defnitly a great buy.

B00BB22GSU|5|Vampire Weekend is just so fantastic, this album was fantastic
B00821OW8K|5|I've read and mulled over many of the high numbers of reviews on this series. Most of the negatives are just to be negative as I see it. The positive reviews are well thought out and accurate for the most part, Why this is another alien vs the human race plot? Come on folks! It's entirely possible that will happen!<br /><br />Noah portrays a believable prof in unbelievably difficult situations - and rises to the occasion. Of course he does, he's the main protagonist! The human element, with human needs and wants is also well portrayed. I doubt in real life it would be any different. Of course there would be times of non-action - and others?  It's all about being a human being and retaining that special manner. In any way possible, considering the odds. The story certainly allows the participants to rise to the occasion. My question is would we really behave that well. Would we watch out for others...or take care of ourselves only, ultimately wiping us all out and leaving Earth to cockroaches. I don't know, and that's a question that couldn't possibly be answered unless this very thing happened.<br /><br />I am particularly impressed in the manner of behavioral portrayal. Things would change. For children especially, for their parents certainly, for everyone, definitely.<br /><br />If anyone knows how to blow up Voyager? Please do. That was one of the biggest mistakes we ever made as far as the human race. In my humble opinion, of course. If anything resembling this story line were to happen I'd bet everything Voyager as the initiating factor(s).<br /><br />Again, if anyone disbelieves there are bad guys from other planets/galaxies? Not bright. If we can evolve, so could other species. That's simple math. There may be good guys - but would they come here for brunch? Not likely, Good guy aliens? Probably stay at home. Bad guy aliens? Yep. They'd come to eat us in one way or another. We certainly couldn't be the only species to have used up their planet, could we? Again, simple math.<br /><br />Steven Spielberg did well once again. I will buy every single season, and enjoy each episode.n, simple math.<br /><br />Steven Spielberg did well once again.

1449433251|4|Great gift and was very much appreciated.  Unfortunately it arrived with book 1, book 2, and two book 4's (no book 3).  That was a bit of a let down upon opening birthday gift.  I am unable to return since I got it in Nov, but would love to get a book 3 in return for one of the book 4.

B003PIUC02|3|Blu-ray disc #4 had trouble working about 6 months after I got it.  I really like the series but disc #4 started having problems  reading on my blu-ray player and ps3. The disc is in perfect  condition but now doesnt work at all. There is no way to return  or replace disc four and, it makes me think buying any blu-ray on Amazon  may not be the way to go.
B00770KR7W|1|The toy that this company shipped to me was not only sent in EXTREMELY damaged packaging, but also the figure itself had paint coming off the side of its helmet and its leg/calf section was poorly molded, resulting in a terrible toy altogether. I blame GoHastings for this and are sure that the figures themselves are not at all terrible in any manner.
B009ZQ8FQG|4|The stories too unrealistic-- people able to walk from a total paralysis and than eventually die. Too many sudden deaths-- but you get addicted to the characters-- that is what makes one comeback to the series.
B00IX9UPV4|2|I don't need this
0307891372|5|This thing is a behemoth! Bought mine used for 11 bucks and wasn't disappointed at all. Even included the map i predicted wouldn't be there because of the used aspect..but it was there! this thing is detailed, informative and heavy. your Skyrim enthusiast will thank you.
B00H71PBQ8|4|This has become a total soap opera. Still enjoy it but wouldn't recommend anyone starting the series if they hadn't seen others.
B004T0XYM8|5|So much has been written of Leone's last Western with Eastwood, \\"The Good, Bad and the Ugly\\" that one can overlook this masterpiece from him starring a top flight cast of Henry Fonda, Claudia Cardinale, Jason Robards and Charles Bronson in the role that was originally slated for Clint Eastwood--\\"Harmonica\\".  If you want a culmination of all the great directors who have mined this genre, like Ford, Mann and Hawks--you couldn't look no further than this classic.  Yet there's also a touch of the sardonic in Leone's direction that we don't get these great directors.  My only complaint is in the dubbing of some of the villains in this film.  In particular at the beginning of this film where Bronson meets the three hombres dispatched by Frank (Fonda), they are brilliantly played by 2 distinctly American character actors, Woody Strode and Jack Elam, plus an unknown european actor I'm unfamiliar with.  I'm very familiar with Elam's voice so it was disconcerning to me to find him dubbed--and it didn't match his physical demeanor.  One will never know why Leone did this since Jack's voice is sinister enough to convey menance.  Anyway, outside of Cardinale's dubbing which I can understand since she definitely has an Italian accent plus a semi-raspy voice, the leads are superb with the added attraction of Fonda's cold-blooded killer, one of the first times along with his role in \\"Firecreek\\", to play against image--and successfully to boot.  He's stated in interviews that this was one of his favorite roles, playing an outright S.O.B. with no saving graces--and I agree.  I hopefully expect that the scene between Cheyenne and the crippled CEO is restored in the Blu-ray version.
B00GUO2SKA|5|Lest we forget what the early days of the AIDS epidemic were like this film is a reminder of what could and could not be done in the United States at that time! A man who was afflicted taught himself what might work and he survived for seven years versus the thirty days he was given by the medical establishment.
B000069AUI|5|With their first album, Coldplay slipped by my musical radar.  It took a great sophomore album for me to discover their passion.<br />While many new artists strive to be different, while many producers jiggle buttons to &quot;create&quot; music, Coldplay goes blithely about their artistic business, proving that less is more.  Through deceptively simple lyrics, melodies, and vocals, this band reaches for and attains greatness.  Chris Martin delivers heartfelt words with slippery and carefree nuances that actually punctuate the deeper meanings.  The piano and guitar glide together and swirl apart with the grace of a dancing duo.  At the core, the bass and drums drive at full speed or measured restraint, based upon the mood of the song.<br />Going back to explore the first album, &quot;Parachutes,&quot; I heard the wonderful honesty of a band coming to terms with themselves.  Here, on &quot;A Cold Rush of Blood to the Head,&quot; I am awed by the simplicity on a grand scale.<br />Coldplay has done what so many forget: They abandon themselves to their art rather than trying to capture it.
B004LROUNG|5|Great read.  I recommend it highly.
B00526ZKYS|5|I love every book in the Delirium series. I have never actually said this before but I wish this was a movie. The plot is excellent and very exciting. I stayed up way too late for a week reading the series. I really really really wish there was a book 4!
B000PMLFRA|5|Excellent quality on blue ray.  Purchased used, no problems, arrived in good condition and plays fine.  No problems or concerns.

B0000028M7|5|I'm sure most of you know that Layne Staley was recently found dead in his Seattle home at the age of 34.  While his passing is a huge loss to the music world, his voice will live on in the amazing body of work Alice In Chains released.<br />All of their albums &amp; ep's are great, but &quot;Dirt&quot; is probably their definitive album.  It runs the gammut of bone-crushing tunes like &quot;Them Bones&quot; and &quot;Angry Chair&quot; to songs like &quot;Down in a Hole&quot;, which displays Layne Staley's and Jerry Cantrell's great vocal harmonies.  <br />Every song on this album leaves you wanting to hear everything by this band.  And I suggest that you pick up ALL of their releases.  Everything they ever put out is amazing!
B003XF1XOQ|3|If you've already read the first two books in the series, you'll have to read this one to find out what happens.  But we all hated the ending.

B00AQ3K8IU|2|Although there were some clever ideas like the name Hopeless, I found the bookj trite.<br />The seemingly endless pages of description about the kisses made me wonder if the author<br />was being paid by the word or page.

B00EFWU91E|5|tied up all the characters in the end  a little wordy but a very good read
B00BAXFECK|4|The detail Donna Tartt goes into with even the most basic of things is astonishing and sometimes it's more than I would like.  But it never ceased to keep me interested because even her ability to describe the mundane is well done, hence allowed me to push through the story with sustained interest through the whole book.  An easy read, great for entertainment, very good story and character development, and I learned an enormous amount of new vocabulary words (really impressed with her breadth of word knowledge).  I recommend this book.
B008I34YYY|4|Recommended by a friend, and I'm recommending it forward.<br /><br />My haiku:<br /><br />Nazis invade earth<br />from the moon - sci fi, yes, but<br />great satire as well.
B00DR0PDNE|3|finicky for me with wireless connection.  it's also not compatible with all routers, make sure yours is.  cheaper but not as good as roku.
B00004RF83|5|Two years after \\"The Manchurian Candidate,\\" director Frankenheimer scored again with this gripping political thriller. Beyond serving as a showcase for two frequently paired stars- Lancaster as power-mad general, Douglas as principled whistle-blower--the movie works because in the context of the paranoic Cold War era, the premise feels all-too-plausible. Stark black-and-white photography and brisk pacing only add to the film's breathless tension.
B0086700CM|3|it was fun for awhile until it got laggy. not on the kindle but on android. also turning is also mistaken for ducking and makes me die a lot. please fix
B00KDEVVDI|5|10 minutes, and I'm hooked. What a great perk from Amazon, thank you!
0060899190|5|I have purchased both this book and his 2nd book and I found that the first postsecret book was the best. It has a wide range of emotions in its postcards and is filled with much more than the 2nd book. I recommend this book because it is great.
B000001E18|4|Written, recorded and released in the midst of U2's \\"Zoo TV\\"(ACHTUNG BABY) world tour, ZOOROPA manages to enjoy the kind of relationship with its epic predecessor that RATTLE AND HUM tried, but failed, to have with THE JOSHUA TREE. While very much the son of ACHTUNG BABY in many respects, from its title to its liberal incorporation of dance elements and electronica, ZOOROPA shows U2 capable of expanding even upon what is, in my own opinion at least, its most perfect creation.     In general, on ZOOROPA the tracks are longer, the beats denser, the effects more ubiquitous and the passions more filtered than on ACHTUNG BABY. Having examined the world of the nineties from the standpoint of its (mostly destructive) effect on intimate relationships on the previous album, U2 here takes a more abstract approach, mimicking the sound and sensibility of a media-drenched, character-crushing reality in a poker-faced social critique at once hypnotic and chilling.     The title track sets the tone perfectly. A six-and-a-half-minute rumination on the European Union, it opens to a moaning backdrop of sound effects and advertising snippets, struts through a slow and sexy groove for a while and finally erupts into a classic U2 anthem beautifully enhanced by a battery of synthesizers. \\"Numb\\" offers zombie vocals from guitarist the Edge, whose endless list of \\"Don't\\"s works wonders against a soundscape of arcade noises and Bono's squealing counterpoints. \\"Lemon\\" is a delicious dance theme - mostly thanks to Adam Clayton's hip-shaking bass line - which disguises some fairly bleak comments on the material fixations of the contemporary romantic dilettante. \\"Stay(Faraway, So Close!)\\" is a lovely ballad which would almost sound out of place here but for its forlorn, tortured lyrics. \\"The First Time\\" is likewise effecting, a slow and almost whispered ray of hope in the darkness, reminding us that those closest to us shall be our only solace in the end. \\"Dirty Day\\" nicely pastes lines frompoet Charles Bukowski alongside a loping rhythm. Closing things out, the apocalyptic screenplay \\"The Wanderer\\" literally injects America into the proceedings by handing vocal duties to Johnny Cash, a brilliantly bizarre twist with which to end a bizarrely brilliant album.     To be sure, ZOOROPA lacks the end-to-end glow of ACHTUNG BABY - \\"Babyface\\" is fairly forgettable, ditto \\"Some Days Are Better than Others,\\" and \\"Daddy's Gonna Pay for Your Crashed Car\\" does less with its wonderful title than it should - but it more than makes up for its missteps with an admirable experimental verve and the sheer force of its sound. This time out, U2 was definitely more about the music than the message, and the music is dandy indeed.
B003YFIUW8|5|I love this book. I love the style / perspective that it's written in. I recommended it to all my friends.
B00008NRI7|3|Fans of Sandra Bullock and Hugh Grant are probably more enamored of this movie than I am, but if you like lightweight comedies and romantic conflicts, then TWO WEEKS NOTICE isn't all that bad.  Reminiscent of the Doris Day/Rock Hudson comedies of the sixties, this movie brings us Bullock as a legal aid lawyer who has been raised to stand up for causes she believes in, even if it means getting arrested in doing so.  Her latest foe is a corporation run by none other than Mr. Grant, who plans on tearing down the beloved community center on Coney Island.  Grant strikes up a deal that he'll spare the building if she comes to work for him.  Despite the protests of her parents, including Robert Klein as her feisty dad, she accepts and finds herself helping Grant pick out his clothes, ties, colognes and other personal duties.  After a while, she decides to give her two weeks notice and trains her replacement, a wispy young redhead named June Carver (Alicia Witt), who makes a play for the handsome womanizer.  From there, it's just a matter of time till the ill-matched pair realize they'e in love and one can certainly guess where the movie ends up.<br /><br />Bullock and Grant are in good form, with Grant getting all the good lines, and the film uses contemporary pop songs effectively, letting the music mirror the particular scene.  If you like this kind of lightweight comedy, you'll probably like TWO WEEKS NOTICE.
0736430512|5|We have read this story many times, the pictures are great to keep the interest of two toddlers
B007J4T2G8|2|Very repetitive, twilight with no vampires or wolves replaced by whips and cuffs. Okay story but not very well written. Curious to see how the movie turns out.
1401232590|3|Batman: The Long Halloween is definitely worth your money and contains a deep story that has influenced every facet of batman, most recently the dark knight trilogy. For example, the scene in The Dark Knight were Joker burns the cash is inspired by a scene in this book. \\"I believe in harvey dent\\" was created in this book. The art is excellent. Its really different and in some ways funny because there are entire scenes stolen from the godfather. It explores some philosophical issues, which is always a plus for me, and deals a lot with crime and punishment and how it often seems to fail. That being said, no part of the story really pops or excites, and sometimes it seems villains show up for no reason at all and it feels a little muddled and unclear as to what the ultimate goal of this book was outside establishing two face's origin. Important but highly overrated.
B00DR0PDNE|1|VERY LIMITED
B00I8Q77Y0|4|This is a great game seeing that flappy bird was deleted and never even put on amazon. Also, the animations and textures are very good.
B00DR0PDNE|5|Very happy. The service level was superb. The Chromecast got here fast and at the right price. We are all very happy here.
B000GPIPSS|4|Classic movies never die.  This is one of the original monster movies from Universal. There are not the special effects as today's horror films, but it is scary.  I'm sure the early audiences were screaming.  I enjoy watching older films, and the bonus features are a treat, especially the Spanish version.  Universal is now in its 100th year, and I'm sure Dracula will be around another 100 years.
B00FAPF5U0|5|I love this game and now that my kindle is working again, I can download it! CANDY CRUSH WOO!
031603438X|2|In essence, the story is there to write but come on Keith! (or Mr. Fox) you guys  miss it....the devil is in the detail and there is NO DETAIL; there is skimming of some events and rumors (Altamont, transfusions, Brian Jones, Ron woods alcohol dependency). But what about everything else?     I dont buy it...there is much more to say and I found the books about the 1972 tour/exile era to be much more honest, informative and frankly more readable. Sorry Keith, I love you and the Stones for what you did represent, for what you have gone through but this book is a let down.
B00004X01U|1|It is truly a misnomer to have titled this album &quot;MUSIC&quot; when in fact it doesn't contain any, or if there is it is kept well hidden. Once again Madonna proves beyond a doubt that attitude and controversy are no substitute for the real thing(Talent). The backgrounds are so fabricated and overproduced that it's  hard to tell sometimes what you're listening too. If you're a fan of her earlier stuff, I would recommmend sticking to it. Afterall when it was first released it was just junk, now however it has become vintage junk!
B00FAPF5U0|5|This game is challenging but loads of fun. The creativity of this game is unbelievable and there's a new twist to the saga around every corner and new obstacles to face on every level.
B008MG1E4A|5|EASY read, tells the story well without letting out classified information. Makes you proud of what the SEAL and all military do for our country.
B00DPM7TIG|3|Slow reading.
B009X2CVXA|4|I found it difficult to get into this book at first but, as usual, Kate Morton tells a very good story which has several twists and keeps you wanting to keep reading to find out more. The characters are adorable and thoroughly believable and the content is well researched. A well written book but I still prefer The Secret Keeper personally, but I would recommend this book to others for sure.
B0086700CM|5|This game is awesome. I love it so much. kids will like ir too! woohoo. haha. GET TTHIS GAME! (:
B008FRFN7A|5|Cool I just wish I knew how to print from my Kindle instead of having to email it to myself and getting on my laptop to print
0062197266|5|More of a 4.5 stars, because this one was a bit tricky. Into the Darkest Corner is a engrossing cautionary tale of romance and obsession. It deals with loads of psychological issues in both their short and long term effects, and it was just so completely unputdownable I spent several hours in which I should have been studying for finals with my eyes stuck to Cathy Bailey's story.<br /><br />Basically, picture the following: You meet a guy, an intensely attractive and seemingly perfect guy, and ,out of some improbable conjunction of stars or rare alignment of planets, you both start dating. Your friends love him, he loves you, and it's all just red-paper hearts and champagne bottles, up until Perfect Guy starts veering a bit to the odd side. He doesn't like it when you go out with your friends without him, he has some very strong suggestions as to what you should wear, and, occasionally, the rough sex he has with you is less Fifty Shades of Gray than it is Fifthy Shades of Sore. Things get out of control and soon you find yourself beat up and traumatized, among other things, and as it manages to do once in a while, the system works and your ex goes to prison. Three years later, you're a different person, scared of people who aren't there, checking locks you know you already locked. Three years later, you might finally find happiness again. But three years later, is also when he gets out of jail, and you just know he's coming back for you.<br /><br />Into The Darkest Corner was fraught with tension and good writing, and despite veering towards the not-so-great as it neared its end, the book still had me hooked all through its 497 pages, plus it ended in a moment of ominous foreboding. I worried with Cathy, laughed with her, felt sorry for her, and was rejoiced to see her life finally make a turn for the better. As is the case with most thrillers, the ending doesn't make justice to the rest of the book, but despite that I burned through Into The Darkest Corner faster than I would most good books, and it is one of the best debuts I've read so far, along with Gillian Flynn's Sharp Objects and S.J. Watson's Before I Go To Sleep.<br /><br />I don't believe this is a book for everyone, due to the heavy domestic violence it portrays, but I don't think it ought to be a issue for most, especially since Ms. Haynes manages to weave lighthearted, romantic moments perfectly with instances of either spine-tingling suspense or shocking violence. If you are looking for a thriller that will grab you by the neck and won't let go of it until all the pages are past you and you're left panting for air, Into the Darkest Corner is it.
B006LSZECO|4|It has a every interesting twist.
B00BLGY8X2|3|Artistic interpretation aside, there should be a warning or review or maybe casual mention about the gross nudity / sex scenes within this film.
0312383320|2|Stephanie Plum is back in her first full-length Between-the-Numbers novel. Her FTA is Martin Munch. Diesel assists her with Munch as he is looking for Wulf Grimoire. Lula also attempts to help, however she's has personal problems of her own: planning her wedding to Tank, one of Ranger's men.    Honestly, I'm not sure what to think about this book. I guess I've expected more from this series. By now, I think Stephanie would know how to effectively capture a FTA. I feel as though I'm reading the same plot book after book. I understand Stephanie Plum is a comical cozy series, if you will, however the situations Stephanie finds herself in is just over the top.    I liked Carl the monkey, however giving people the finger got old for me around page 22. At times, I forgot about the other characters. Stephanie's parents and grandmother have a few appearances in the novel. Morelli is allowing his brother to crash at his place because his wife kicked him out. Ranger comes to rescue Stephanie from tricky situations. Other than that, they're hardly mentioned at all. This books really centers around Stephanie and Diesel.    I only recommend this book if you want to stay current with the series, however I wouldn't rush out to buy it. Hopefully book 15 will be better.
B003EYVXXW|5|Rachel is very beautiful starring in this wonderful movie but very sad! Just shows how religion ruins the world! John Lennon \\"Imagined\\" the right idea!
B006MW3UZW|5|I like the way it goes into more detail about things that happened, that way I understand better. You can make more episodes I love them.Alice
B00LDNE3FG|4|I like how you can start from different check points! One thing I don't like is that you should be able to buy some more smasher
B00687Q0VC|5|It was great. I thoroughly enjoyed it.  There was info that we never discussed in school. If I had more time I think I would want<br />to read his bio.
B005G8AFFG|5|Ana Popivic is my newest fave musician... She is kinda like Kenny Wayne Shephard in female form. Nice beat, great lyrics.<br />First purchased Can you stand the heat and then purchased unconditional.... I drive about 2 hours a day and it is  nice to have some good driving music...
B00JP5ONY0|4|The pace was good for a lazy weekend movie, it was a little dreary at times. The bearded guy reminded me of Lazy Town, too cartoonish. The story was fun, some action felt rushed. Good to watch with my Tweens, they laughed at the porpoise. I laughed.
0553108034|5|Very good I love this series
B00A8ECU24|1|I weathered the other \\"updates\\" okay...but this last one broke my game. I was at level 52, I had spent money on gems, I had bought specialty ponies that required those gems.  Then this update tonight. Ah what fun it has been. first off it crashed in the update and had to restart that 3 times(yeah big surprise) then it finally gets there and it says STRING NOT FOUND. so I click it again...I'm a pro at this after all, and finally after my third poke on the screen of my Kindle Fire it starts...at the BEGINNING. As in I'm back at the stupid \\"elements of harmony\\" video intro to the game...and then it crashed halfway through. I had all of the main 6...I had nearly all the shops, I was past scootaloo and done with the Rarity quests... I was working slowly on the canterlot quests of pony joe...and now I think I lost it all. worse I just paid for Cadence and Shining Armor. ARGH!  When the game works, its great and fun and mildly entertaining...its like any of the 'ville games from zynga...to many quests needs money but fun...and just like zynga crashes often.
B00FWLDHSY|5|A great 21st-century tribute to old Japanese monster movies with big robots vs big monsters.  I really can't say just how much fun this movie was to watch.  It's just a plain good adventure story with a simple premise, likeable characters, big tech machines, and some bad-ass sea monsters to fight.  A fabulous display of filmmaking artistry by Guillermo del Toro with intense special effects and a story told with a lot of heart.<br /><br />Just sit back and enjoy the ride!

B0077PBPJ6|3|Maybe it was a mistake to view this right after being immersed in \\"Downton Abbey\\". Same time period. Same Masterpiece Classic presentation. Same Battle of the Somme. But the comparisons end there. As the plot explains, Steven, a young man working for a callous factory owner in France falls in love with Isabelle, the owner's wife. The story jumps back and forth between their illicit tryst in 1910 to the horrors of trench warfare in 1916 where Steven is now a junior officer in the British Army.<br /><br />The initial sequences are what lag the most. Despite the obvious attractiveness of the couple, Steven and Isabelle both seem oddly allergic to words. Instead, there are long loving gazes, long anguished gazes, long questioning gazes. They exchange about ten words between them, half of them inaudible. It is here that one misses the rich conversational wit, compassion and swordplay of \\"Downton Abbey\\". Isabelle abruptly disappears (we later find out why), Steven is left in torment despite having Isabelle's willing sister, Jeanne at his disposal.<br /><br />The actions picks up during the World War I segments as it is obvious the Brits are still haunted by July 1, 1916, the day they lost 20,000 men in one day during the catastrophic Battle of the Somme. The blasted expanse of No-Man's Land is an exact replica of the one used in both \\"Downton Abbey\\" and \\"War Horse\\" which makes you wonder if it is a space specifically rented out for WWI movies. But the scenes of battle are unsparing and horribly graphic. Steven is assigned to a tunneling outfit, the \\"Sewer Rats\\" and forms a friendship of sorts with Jack Firebrace, a solid workingman who is suffering from the loss of his young son. Jack's poignancy helps mitigate Steven's wallowing self-pity as well as reminding him that love is the only thing that matters, a lesson that Steven will need to utilize to become a full man.<br /><br />Steven and Isabelle reunite briefly during a lull in the fighting but I found myself not caring. I had enough of their doe-eyed gazes which lack chemistry and tension. I was more intrigued if Steven would man up and take responsibility for those others who have come into his life (I am avoiding spoilers here!).<br /><br />Overall, \\"Birdsong\\" was a small disappointment, only worth watching if there's nothing else available.g. I had enough of their doe-eyed gazes which lack chemistry and tension.

1451629192|5|After reading Shattered Innocence I had to read S Stolen Life which made Jaycee's story even more real--a real eye opener
B0058VW36U|4|I love this app. I'm not the best at it but its really neat and addicting. I love the little critter on there. He is so cute!
B00004ZAV3|5|Well I like this album and it sounds great, but like other Beatles fans out there there does leave alot to be desired. I realize this is a No 1 hits only CD but man I thought they had more No 1 hits than this.... im surprised, theres alot here but I was under the impression every song they wrote was a no 1 hit, guess not. buy this Cd its worth it.....
B000084T18|5|Great...This album is one of the best albums you can find.  Now don't get me wrong, it is definetly not the greatest album of all time, but is definetly top 10.  If you are a rap fan, chances are you already own this album but if you don't, stop reading this review right now and go get it.  ***** (5 stars)
B00HYZBX9Q|3|It is compatible and I made a mistake and I think it is working just fine.I have it only for two days
B004EBZX6W|5|Gives accurate report
0385335482|5|I would recommend this book to anyone that is looking for a fun read.  For the first time ever I seriously couldn't put the book down.  It was delightful that things did not take place as one might think, but holds the reader until the end.  Even at that that point I wanted to rush to the book store to buy the following books in the series.  I would recommend this book 100%!!
B00D5LC4GY|4|Good, not too easy easy, not too hard game. The only thing I do not like is it's timer. I really enjoy in it and I recommend it of course.
B00005OAIE|4|I really like this CD...but am I the only one who thinks John Mayer must be related to Michael Franks, soft Jazz singer popular in the late 70's, early 80's? Similar voices...same rhythms.
B00APUYN0I|4|I feel like this movie is this generation's \\"Bring it On.\\" It's silly, sometimes outrageous, and always entertaining. The music is top notch, Anna Kendrick fits the protagonist bill like a glove, an Rebel Wilson puts in another stand out performance as Fat Amy.<br /><br />I think people sometimes place unnecessary expectations on a movie and then they miss the simple humor and joy that comes out of a young adult comedy. Give Pitch Perfect a chance and you might just be amazed.
B0067Q42BY|5|This is an awesome game. I enjoy playing it for hours I also like the fact that they save your progress. Great game
B000FC0OOU|5|Very exciting.  There is something special about Hemingway. I can see why this was a classic.  Interesting use of the language.
B007ZGO7EM|5|Love this calculator!  Very easy to use and big enough for older eyes.  Love it.  Just another reason to love my Kindle Fire.
B008BQ8YHQ|5|I have just found suits and have really enjoyed the fast pace. The character development has been excellent. I look forward to this season.
B004J4WLB4|5|The delicious mix of heartwarming and heartbreaking.  I found myself irritated with Victoria but sympathetic to her at the same time.  The steady flow of kind and understanding people in her life that she struggled to let in....a beautifully thought-provoking story.
B000FA5STS|4|I was riveted to the book from cover to cover and could not wait to find out the outcome of the characters.
B003WUYRGI|5|I read the whole book and it is very educational, inspirational, and intriguing. Also my baes love it. Great book.
B00BSBU4EC|4|IF your looking for a fun loving movie to keep the kids entertained this is the one to watch.<br />Thanks to amazon for offering the 24 hour rental your going to need it with the kids wanting to watch it over and over.
B0064TVQ5E|3|I like playing this game on just about anything except this tablet.  my fingers are to big I think. oh well
B001MSMULG|5|I really like Dan Silva books as they keep my attention while not scaring me to death. Great character development and just enough suspense to satisfy.
B007UQ5Z1G|5|Good package. I like it.
B001GA1RFA|5|I thought this book was so cute. I love the storyline and i always get upset with the endings of books but this one had a pretty good ending. I definately recomend it espesially if you like john green's books.
B00CFITJKW|1|Don't waste your money! The graphics are really bad,it also tends to stop working when you try to land. I regret buying it!!!
B00CWY76CC|5|Great game!  Kept coming back til I could solve the puzzle!  It was really made me look at things differently!
B009YP9L7U|5|Easy, fast, fun read!
B000LXQVA4|5|I love this thing! We use it sparingly (as per doc recommendations) but our little guy just loves it. Initially, he was all about the bounce & lights. After a bit, he started turning to appreciate the two back activity areas - the lizard and the sun. As he's gotten older, he really loves the details and higher level activities. He just figured out how to turn around the elephant and giggles wildly when it spins back around! Now he'll jump to pull at the tree frog & parrot above. It's neat to see him grow into the various phases of this toy ... and that reaffirms it's value since it isn't a cheap investment as far as short-lived baby toys go!<br /><br />We bought this for our little guy when he was just shy of 4 months - but in the 99th % for size. He fit into it great but needed a little help in the height department (we used a folded yoga mat under his legs for this purpose and to cushion his landing a bit). I wouldn't recommend early use of this toy (before 4 months) unless your child is on the larger size, has awesome head control, and can already assisted stand a bit. A LOT of movement is possible here and their still developing spine & muscles might not handle all the rigorous exercise well.<br /><br />The ONLY negative, and it's a small one, is the quality of the plush toys that hand - the parrot & frog. We have the FP musical rainforest mobile that coordinates with this model Jumperoo...it features the same animals. The plush animals on the mobile are a much higher quality. If I didn't have both, I'd never have known the difference. But, since I do have both, I'm left wondering why the cheaped out on this detail if they already had a similar item in production?!? The mobile ones really are much nicer. Not worth taking off a star, though. This thing is awesome!
0385336691|5|Lee Child has gotten back in his taut style with the latest Jack Reacher book, The Hard Way - If you have never read one of the Reacher books, this is a good way to get hooked - Reacher, ex-military, literally lives off the grid - goes place to place with the clothes on his back and the necessities in his pocket- He still has his excellent reputation going for him as a tough, no-nonsense man, who has a tremendous sense of honor, albeit his own brand. This book deals with a supposed kidnapping of a wife and daughter, and Reacher being in the right time and place to see the vehicle where the ransom money was dropped. He's brought into the search after he gives the car's description to one of the search team. Soon he has his own theories and with the help of (of course) a beautiful older lady investigator, he sets about to see what is really going on.<br /><br />The phrase on the title review is one of Reacher's favorite sayings - That's for Da-n sure! - When you get it the hard way, the right way, you will be saying 'that's for darn sure' the way to write a book!
B00J8CG6KE|1|Just did not like.  Alote drugs ect.
B00GUJP9PG|5|Could spend many hours playing this game.  My young kids love driving the tractors around.  You do have to purchase better tractors.  Most of the time you can get things done with the tractors you are allowed.  I just purchased more with the money you make.
B007GCY8FS|4|This is his second book and it is much better than the first.  In the<br />first he had poor editing and used the word &#34;shrugged&#34; about 500 times.<br />He killed the same bad guy twice, the first time in a car ambush and the<br />second time in a money fire. Inspite of that I liked the first book and went<br />straight to the second.  This second book is very different. I can't put it<br />down.
B00TEAVEY8|5|Good Game I like playing it!!!!!
B006VFLIYK|5|Another excellent read from an outstanding author. I recommend this book highly. I hope to see more of his talented books
0451529065|5|There are several versions of origin out there on the market, some illustrated, some leather bound or hardback, hell there's even one that's been vandalised by Ray Comfort with some embarrassing creationist propaganda - sigh    There's not much new to say about Darwin's words in this book as most versions are just copies of the 150 year old original, a good thing too, but there are a few incentives    The foreword by Huxley is one of the best out there, and lets not forget that this anniversary edition could be a treasure worth owning several years from now, prized by collectors, oh.... and its cheap!    All in all, if you already own origin don't be so quick to pass this one by, it's like buying a rare commemorative stamp or coin, it might just be worth something one day!!!
B00BRBIA6C|5|Agnetha's voice still sounds beautiful here and the songs are great.  This is definitely adult contemporary so, except for one danceable song , don't expect Abba's sound but just beautifully crafted and sung songs by a singer that has been away far too long. Infinitely better than My Coloring Book and just really great music.
B0050UEVNM|5|This is one of my favorite little know movies.  Wore out the VHS copy, so I finally got the DVD version.
B0000AQS0F|5|Every episode of this series is brilliant.  I can't stand all the garbage on TV, and Firefly demonstrates what TV ought to be.  The characters are original and well developed, the writing is hillarious and insightful at the same time, and all the episodes fit together to tell a bigger story.  The story takes lots of unexpected turns, but if you go back and watch the earlier episodes again, you can see the clues that were cleverly embedded.  On top of all that, the show is just plain fun -- a sci-fi/western combination with lots of action, shot in a way that makes it feel like you're there.   <br /> <br />It's too bad fox didn't give this show a fair chance.  I didn't even know about this show until after it was cancelled, and it's the most innovative, exciting, and funny show I've ever seen.
B00I6JOD2S|5|My little girl loves it!
B006ZZANDI|1|I do not like one direction... Got this for my retarded 20yr old cousin because she's so special. They sing good just not a fan
B00005JPCA|2|What a bore. I wasn't really excited to this the blonde bond but I went to see it anyway because the last one with pierce was so so good but anyway on with the review. This movie was boring. No gadgets that bond usually has. No witty conversations. If you watch it most of the time they aren't saying anything just chasing eachother and the casino scene is about 20 minutes too long. And the vilian with the bleeding eye? So what!!!! Eva as the bond girl was stupid. The other girl that got killed should have been the bond girl. Eva looked too homely to be considered hot. And oh the blonde bond, what ever his name is isn't hot either!

B0000UJL96|3|artwork on disc 2 of the Special Edition is upside down! where's the quality control??
0060934700|5|And my daughter says...<br /><br />\\"This book, recommended to me by the same friend who got me hooked on The Sandman comics, went far beyond my expectations. Typically, as masterful as a novelist can be, their short stories often fall short. Not so with this collection. Gaiman combines fantasy and horror to bring to life characters that typically find themselves in unbelievable situations. However, Gaiman's fantastic writing makes these events seem normal, everyday occurrences.  In particular, I would recommend the retelling of Snow White and the Wedding Story.<br /><br />In addition to the short fiction, Gaiman also includes some of his poetry. Ranging from scenes of lonely vampires to a computer game that takes over unknowing minds, all of the poetry is engaging and will absorb your attention for quite some time after you have put down the book.<br /><br />Overall, I would recommend this collection for anyone who enjoys fantasy, horror, and good writing. And now, I think I will go reread the book for the fourth time...\\"
B00AR1G3FS|2|Low audio quality
B00BAXFECK|4|Interesting story that propelled me to the end. Verbose at times, but compelling enough that it was worth plowing through.
0399157573|1|I guess it is because Ms. Cornwell has entertained me many times and I keep hoping to experience a great book from her again. Thank you, for all those books, but, I probably won't buy another book unless the reviews are raving.
B00992CF6W|1|another waste of money it would never download to tablet and amazon would never reconize my tablet so why bother
B00RHYBCN6|5|The soundtrack is fabulous, as is the series on Starz.
B00IU0M85C|5|Love it!
B00DJYJRHG|4|I saw quite a bit of this series a while ago on FX. There was a lot I had not seen. I only gave it a 4 star. It was filmed as a &#34;jump&#34; camera shot. It is really jerky (don'[t remember it that way) Much like Homicide: Life On The Street ! Both had Clark Johnson as a director through some of each series, but Homicide didn't have as many &#34;jerky&#34; camera. However &#34;Vic&#34; came off as a terrible person. All in all for $30 for 80 hours of entertainment ... you'll love it !
B0095ZMMCK|5|tom Clancy has always been  a great writer and it is a shame that he is now gone .<br />hopefully someone will step up to the plate and keep his type of writing alive
B000FC1LOC|5|Jodi Picoult has done it again with her book My Sister's Keeper. This is a morally compelling book which had me asking myself...what if I were the sister, how would I feel and what decision would I make; and could I live with the decision?<br /><br />This is another must read book by Picoult!
B00AFEY354|5|WONDERFUL !!!!!
B00MG4X9X8|1|I saw this saw this in 3d in the theater and was really disappointed in the 3d..it was very Flat  , I am not a big fan of this new trilogy although I really enjoyed the first 3 Lord of the Ring, I could really relate to the characters . The prequel has absolutely no Character development in the first 2 movies. I could not cared for anyone.The movie is action packed at times,but that can't be the whole movie. Well because I am a 3d nerd I bought the 3d blu ray for the purpose of seeing if on a large tv the 3d would be better..it was not..if you take off your 3d glasses yes the screen becomes blurred, put them back on and it is in focus, but that is it..focus..not any worthwhile 3d experience at all anywhere in the movie. A 2d conversion to 3d TV would have done the same thing. I realize there are die-hard Hobbit fans and I am glad you like this movie..but realistically is it just bad. YES, I well see the last of the trilogy and hope with everyone else Peter Jackson knocks it out of the park...but I think the magic is gone ! Del Toro  abandoned the ship long ago , anyone wonder why now ?
B000066NW0|5|When I first heard the song \\"Complicated\\" on the radio, I fell in love with it! SO, soon after that, I bought the CD. The CD is awesome!!!!!! All her songs are great, and easy to relate to. She is an awesome writer, and writes mostly about boys. Ever since I got her CD, my stereo is always on with her CD, \\"Let Go\\" playing. If you buy her CD, you definatly made the right choice! I'm now her biggest fan!!!!!!
B00IP8IHEA|5|I heard one of their songs on the radio one day and the next I downloaded this album. They are an amazing group.
B00004YM0D|5|Remember The Titans is a wonder combination of many classical songs. They just keep bringing wonderful hits for you to dance to. Remember The Titans is a terrific, wonderful, and great soundtrack. The movie, is wonderful! I reccomend this soundtrack to anyone, any age, any where.
0439023521|5|It seems that I read one AMAZING book a year and the Hunger Games (trilogy) definitely was that book. The book doesn't grab you immediately, but once the action begins, its a real page turner! I have read the entire series in a little under a week. My only regret is not savoring the book longer. If you love a little science fiction or a little action, this book is for you. I say this as a fan of the Harry Potter series as well as the Twilight series... only now I think Hunger Games might have taken Twilights place on my list of AMAZING reads.   I truly loved the characters and am looking forward to the movie!
B007R6UWN0|5|Nice to see the lead from Brotherhood playing a nice guy and he does it very well. Funny, charming characters support good plots. Production values are excellent and it makes for a nice evening.
B00000IFP6|5|Aunque en realidad Beethoven no fue un compositor tan prolfico de  sinfonas (solo compuso 9 completas, en comparacin a las ms de 40 de  Mozart o las ms de 100 de Haydn), la popularidad de estas obras es tanta  que para el pblico en general, cuando le preguntan respecto a alguna  sinfona que conozca y aprecie casi de inmediato menciona ya sea la 5a o la  9a de Beethoven; por ello no es de extraar que existan una gran cantidad  de grabaciones excelentes de estas obras, en manos de reconocidos  directores y afamadas orquestas. La versin de las 9 sinfonas completas en  manos de David Zinman resulta extraordinariamente buena, considerando el  bajo precio que Ud. paga por estos 5 discos; esta versin est basada en  nuevos descubrimientos que han permitido modificar ligeramente la partitura  tradicional, tomando en cuenta algunos apuntes originales de Beethoven o  algunas partituras previas a las que finalmente salieron publicadas; sin  embargo, las modificaciones resultan casi imperceptibles (aunque en el  folleto marca perfectamente los puntos donde son ms apreciables, hay que  conocer la partitura original para localizarlos, ya que a \\"puro odo\\" no se  nota ninguna diferencia, o al menos yo no la he notado). Los tempos son un  poco rpidos para mi gusto, ya que en lo personal prefiero las versiones  algo ms lentas de Bohm, pero su interpretacin es impecable. Esta es una  compra segura para quien desee adquirir su primera versin de las 9  sinfonas, y resulta una referencia casi obligada para quien ya tenga una  versin previa.
B000002HJR|4|phil anselmo of pantera's side band and its their first album they made and its got slow songs and a couple of great songs that bring back that pantera feeling so its a must have
B000002KGT|5|A wonderful CD!
B00HT944D4|5|Very good
0061785679|5|Rollis is the best in this kind of books. Full of adventure and history. I read a lot of his books, but this is really cool.
0399167064|5|I am happy to say I enjoyed this book as much as The Husband's Secret. The story reminded me a bit of Desperate Housewives--everyone looking one way on the outside but having all kinds of hidden secrets. And Moriary is a master at revealing the secrets bit by tantalizing bit. I love the way the book was written with the countdown to the big Trivia Night and the gossipy quotes from all of the parents were hilarious. This book was so much fun to read--with a serious message in there too. I couldn't stop reading it but now I'm mad that I read it so fast because I don't want to be done with it. Great book!
B003TH14H4|5|Amazing
B0002TJGQS|5|Genuine Maxwell batteries for a cheap price. They seem to last as long as the others I had. Good buy!
B009GEAPYW|4|That's all you really need to know. Sometimes the dialogue lifted straight from the comics doesn't seem to translate well to film - sometimes it'll sound a little awkward - but it stays true to the seminal TDKR and deviates little from the source material.
B005HWUBZ0|5|I Love this CD.  Old style motown R&B.
B000002LSV|5|This is a replacement for a CD I lost years ago! Great songs! Great band!
B00003CWN3|4|Hillary Swank gives a stellar performance as a young adult female who attempts to live her life as a male, in this well-produced tragic independent film.  Based on the true story of \\"Brandon Teena\\" and set in Texas, this tragedy is reminiscent of Matthew Shepard's story, \\"The Laramie Project.\\"  Rated R for good reason: extreme violence, extreme language, sexual content, and nudity.
1400067820|3|I like NN Talebs books, but this one was a slight disappointment. It was repetitive and rambling, and a drag to read due to the lack of proper editing. The ideas in it are good, as you would expect. But it proved far more of a drag to read because the author thought editors are fools (he states this in his books, sort of), with the result that his book is less readable then it would have be otherwise. Excessive macho posturing by the author gets on ones nerves after a while. Worth reading though
B0055PMUSU|5|Great family movie.  Inspiring.  My ten and twelve year-old both loved it.
B009FZHYKU|5|The Walking Dead is the best show on television. Period. AMC has really boiled down what it could be like when man has society pulled out from under him. It makes you think, how close are our primal instincts to the surface?
B00CNQ7CRI|4|At first this book started off slow and I really thought it was all about dating a younger man. Then the bombshell was dropped and changed it into another story. It was not the typical Bridget Jones story that I think other reviewers were looking for. It was more about real life, and in real life bad things happen and we have to move on. This a great mix of comedy and life lessons.
B00DJFIMW6|5|I love it like so much if don't by this app you will be missing out. You unlock new worlds to play on. Think of it this way, a minion version of subway suffers. Get that app too.
B00GY0HJ4K|4|Very challenging, but not too difficult.  No annoying music, thank God.  About half way to level 40, so we'll see if I connect with Facebook when I get there.
0060920386|5|The dot-com stock market insanity of 1999, followed by the dot-bomb fall in 2000, is eerily mirrored in this book from a decade earlier about big money, big egos, and raging insanity.<br />Burroughs and Helyar tell the story of the leveraged buyout of RJR Nabisco in gripping fashion, showing how greed and shortsightedness contributed to the biggest and worst-managed corporate takeover in history.  The players:  Salesman F. Ross Johnson of RJR vs. Henry Kravitz of KKR.  Everything from a wild, rip-roaring potboiler novel is here:  Secret deals, stock market manipulation, flouting of laws, surprise plot twists.  All of it almost unbelievable, but all of it true.<br />The next time you wonder about how people could have been taken in by internet companies with insane stock prices who blew through venture capital as if it were funny money, read this book.  It's well worth your time, effort, and energy.
B00KY7PEAA|1|Did not like this game.  Too slow and involved.
B005CA4SQK|5|good for collectors its a good tv show great characters i recomended i happy whit this product and it arrive in good conditions

B00AKKS278|5|Great book.  I have been practicing this life changing routine every morning for almost 2 months and I can honestly say it  had made a meaningful impact in most areas of my life.
B00L9B7IKE|4|Started slow and was getting tired on the &#34;train&#34;.  But it picked up and took some turns.  Enjoyed for the most part.
B00BOLE7X0|1|Having trouble sleeping? rent/buy this movie! One of the most OVER RATED BORING movies I have ever watched!...Paint DRYING...Grass Growing....and watching C-SPAN are better and free!!...DDL won the best actor for this? WHY?

B0067R0APK|1|Update is a retrogradation, NOT AN IMPROVEMENT! &quot;AccuWeather Platinum˝ is a gross misnomer! IT SUCKS! IT SUCKS! Garbage rip off! I want my money back!
B00CBRH4YU|5|I've been a Malick fan for a long time, since I first saw Badlands many years ago.  In this film he's combined some of the classic themes and motifs from Badlands and Days of Heaven, while still continuing down the path he's been on with his more recent, more unapologetically existential work.  I think To The Wonder is a far more successful film than Tree of Life.  Olga Kurylenko is awesomely gorgeous and deserves serious notice for her acting in the film.  I don't want to say more--it's a masterful work that manages to balance useful narrative and a connection to the incredible elements of ordinary experience on the one hand, along with the classic Malick attention to divinity in all its forms.  This is one of those films that will only get better with each repeat viewing, and I'm grateful that we have it.
B0050CJNJ2|5|I liked their music singles and decided to buy their album for my library. Great deal, Great music, and plenty of words for review, too.
B003U51D58|5|It's one of the best drama series that I have ever watched! I honestly believe that there is not one weak season.
B00000FC5H|5|I grew up listening to EWF, never owned an album of theirs until now. This is one which has all the classics. I love it when am at the gym and can exercise to it!
1577314808|2|Although I agree with the message, I am not a fan of Tolle's writing.  He's too \\"rambly\\" and esoteric for me.  I had to force myself to finish.
B002C6A6N6|5|Amazing!!! Love it!!
B00FEHXCIG|2|The third part is much worse that the previous two. I regret about the time and money spent. I wouldn't recommend buying this movie to anyone. Better go and grab some coffee.
B00881VLCE|4|Great app. lo<br /><br />ads of free puzzles  I spend my free time relaxing and doing the puzzles
B004H4XDBI|5|I am a teenage girl who loved reading as a kid. As I got older reading wasn't cool anymore and it was just something teachers made us do. This book brought back my passion for reading. It's has a beautiful storyline and was very well written. If you liked this series I strongly suggest the crossed matched trilogy. That series and this book is what helped me remember why I loved reading so much as a kid. So if you're thinking about getting this book. Do it. You won't regret it :) .
0783216084|4|This is the first commercial success for Spielberg, but it is not a comercial movie. THe characters have a life of their own, its just not special effects. THere is not present, either, the later traditional  SPielbergs foolish sentimentalism. The movie works as a fine piece of  Swiss watches, even when you notice how the shark is so bad produced, due  to lack of adequated special effects at the time.
B0034JKZ86|4|Movie worked without skips or errors.  Shipping speed was good.
B00F87ZUYG|5|great series
B009O07NDY|5|This is an awesome soundtrack. It is fun and enjoyable to listen to. The best songs on this soundtrack are all of them. if you have not listened to this cd then i recommend you do
B000FP2OPY|5|It was better than as expected! This TV Show was/is Awesome! Plus S/H was quick & arrived early before Xmas during the last minute heavy mail traffic! My wife got this for me as a Xmas gift & chose the cheapest S/H cost which was 5-7 Business days. Loving Anazon.com more & more every time I or family members orders something from this Major Company!
B00003CX95|4|\\"They can take our lives but they cannot take away our freedom\\". Something about this war cry suggests an anachronistic anomaly, but fortunately the rest of the film is so powerfully executed with such a satisfactory abundance of high-octane battle scenes that it makes up for every little guff.<br /><br />Why let minor trivia like historical accuracy detract you from a fabulous Hollywood action flick? If films were produced merely for accuracy, all of our films would look like The Passion. Braveheart, ironically, is a lot more passionate.
B00881VLCE|5|Love it.
B00CWV8X04|3|the quality of the streaming was off at times. I thought this movie would have been better. I think it could have went straight to dvd/blu-ray
B00IZUY0AS|3|There’s some gospel shouting happening during the peak of Go Down Moses, but this collection of songs is mostly mellow and relaxed. It’s a self-titled album, so I guess the music is a reflection of the artist. Natalie Merchant is a 50-year-old mother now, long past the rock-party days of 10000 Maniacs, and trying to appreciate her new music takes patience. Occasionally there’s a payoff; puttering horns over marching drums make for desolate beauty on Seven Deadly Sins; but usually not. The elegant string arrangement on The End is a technical marvel, for example, but the vocal melodies are no match aesthetically.<br /><br />marcellee.com
B00005NKKV|5|I listen to this album again and again.  It is a favorite of all the family.  I recommend it highly.
B008NBEXZQ|5|i always love celine singing in her native tongue. this album adds more spice to her tremendous talent. she conquered the world every after release of her album may it be in english or french!
B0011UBDTK|4|I did not buy this for myself so I can not personally say how good the quality of it is. However I did buy it for my girlfriend and she says she enjoys it very much. The time of delivery was also exactly the date it was supposed to be delivered so that was great.
B00003JRCQ|4|Much of the praise given to this movie is deserved. The acting is uniformly excellent. Indeed, every character, excepting none, is carefully etched and individuality drawn. To name a few: Ciaran Hinds as Wentworth, Sophie Thompson as the ever-complaining, self absorbed sister Mary, Corin Redgrave as the narcissistic, snobbish aristocrat Sir Walter Elliot,  Susan Fleetwood as the a sympathetic, but still classist Lady Russell, Richard McCabe as a falsely fragile, introspective Captain Benwick, Samual West as scheming, polished, pretty boy scoundrel; also, with the reservation noted below, Amanda Root as Anne Elliot.      The period is superbly portrayed.  The attitudes about society, class, and birth rights being almost incomprehensible by modern mores are made tangibly credible.  The costumes, personal appearance, and grooming all accurately show Eighteenth century England, a time quite different from our own.  People, even upper class people, sweat, sometimes wear dirty cloths, are not always perfectly shaven, don't always have straight teeth and show real emotions and human variation, not to say faults.  Eighteenth century Europe's detailed and steeply declinated social stratification is magnificently, though incidentally, portrayed.    Granted Mr. Elliot's motivation and behavior are under explained, but this is a minor flaw.    So what is really wrong with the movie?  It is just not believable that a homely, reserved, and wilted Anne Elliot could attract or re-attract the dynamic and successful Captain Wentworth.  Amanda Root, being limited by her inherent appearance and personality, may have done a less than optimal job, but I cannot think of any actress who could have made credible that hansom, rich, self assured Wentworth would be attracted to this mouse in the corner.   Perhaps the fault is with Jane Austen's plot.  Perhaps when she wrote the character of Anne Elliot, Jane was indulging in a bit of wishful thinking motivated by her own romantically unfulfilled life.    But I liked it and having seen it several times, have come to accept the improbability of Wentworth's continued attraction to Root's Anne Elliot.  Certainly stranger things have happened.
B00N35P5MW|5|Challenging
B00QJH5O9K|5|great
B000OVLINI|4|Such a good book! Well written, intriguing and genuinely interesting. I found myself completely pulled in by the story, often wondering why Daniel wouldn't level well enough alone and also loving his curiosity. It's different, but give it a chance.
B0018BF1HW|5|Some of his best stuff in one neat package.  A must have for fans of Jeff Beck, or guitar aficionados.
B00HJ92QTI|5|This movie was not only acted well by both actors, but the design, graphics, and realism was astounding. My whole family watched in amazement with only the words &#34;WoW&#34; being expelled during the entire movie. To experience the absolute fear she was feeling kept me on the edge of my seat.
B00008NG5V|4|Good CD, I enjoy it more at home as background muic than something I would listen to all the time in my car.
B00AFROVQC|3|This book is about a young boy who dreams of being in the kings army, the Legion.  As the story builds you find the boy is very young and has not explored anything. He earns his way into the Legion and is learning along the way. He falls for the kings daughter and has a few intense moments, but not the wow you expect from Morgan that I have come to love. This was a good read and can only hope that the next installlment is even better.
B0002F7I9Y|4|Ray's vocals are very tiny and fraile, but one must remember the man was 74 (Seventy-Four) years old! There are no let-me-get-on-the phone-and-play this-for-somebody-to-hear songs to be found here. \\"Here We Go Again\\" with Norah Jones was the cut that won several of the Grammy Awards...How?...we'll never know (Play this up against the 'Original' version from 1967, and you tell me which one sounds the best?). There was a total of 14 (Fourteen) Grammy Awards won for this album! I really think this was the Grammy Voters, and the everybody else simply saying THANK YOU RAY CHARLES FOR GIVING US OVER 50 YEARS OF HISTORY MAKING RECORDINGS!    Album highlights: \\"Hey Girl\\" with Michael McDonald, \\"Over The Rainbow\\" with Johnny Mathis which was played during the parting view of Ray's body during his televised Homegoing Service...That should tell you how great this song is!, and \\"Crazy Love\\" with Van Morrison. This was a nice way to a long career in this business we call music. Now the story doesn't end here...Rhino/Atlantic rush-released an album of duets recorded in 1997-1998 entitled \\"Genuis And Friends\\" which is a better album, but because of Rhino trying to cash in on \\"Genius Loves Company\\" it was met with so-so reviews, lackluster sales and Light Airplay, but still worth having in your collection. In 2005 there was a Box Set that covered his complete Atlantic Records recordings (1952-1959). There wasn't a whole lot of surprises because when Ray signed with ABC Records in late 1959 Atlantic was grabbing almost anything in vaults and releasing Albums and Singles, so there are no major surprises on the Box set. When I save up enough $$$, I'll be buying a copy (And reviewing it...Stay tuned!).    In late 1959 Ray signed with ABC Records who gave him complete control of his recordings. Whatever idea he (Ray) would come up with they (ABC) would give him the gren light, so from the early years (1959 to 1964) they was several Singles that never made it to Albums (Not that they were bad, they just simply were not include for Album release). They are at least 12 (Twelve) from this period that have yet to see the light on Compact Disc! And another 12 (Twelve) or more from 1965 to 1973. In 1965 Ray opened up his R.P.M. Studio and the core of his recordings took place there up until his death in June 0f 2004. Ray would remain with ABC Records for a total of 14 years! So you can imagine how many Unreleased Recordings are sitting in the vaults??? And that's just from the ABC years (1959 to 1973). In 1974 Ray formed Crossover Records and released several albums independently...Did a deal with Atlantic Records (With his Crossover Records imprint). So in short there is a wealth of Unreleased recordings! Hopefully some Record Company will make us happy one day SOON...The only thing we can do now is hope.
0316096199|5|Lucky is the horrific physical side to violence and how others wrongly emotionally react to what physically happened to the &#34;victim.&#34; The Lovely Bones is the emotional detachment of the loss of one's physical rights to ones body and choices for our body and how others physical go on living while the victim is mentally trapped in the pain of rape that feels likes murder of our soul.<br /><br />The two books together are a full psychological experience of one person's violent brutal loss.
B004BLJQOK|5|First off, Chloe Grace Moretz was the perfect choice to play Abby. Second, this is one of the few Foreign to American movie remakes that I've seen lately that I actually really enjoyed.<br /><br />It follows the original pretty faithfully but adds some SFX that are not over-the-top and I feel it is actually superior to the original. There is one part from the original that they did not end up putting in this version and I don't think it took away from it at all.<br /><br />The friendship between Abby and Owen is quite incredible and is very believable especially considering when Owen finds out about her secret. The subplot of Owen dealing with school bullies adds nicely to the story and reminds us of just how rough it can be to be a kid.<br /><br />I highly recommend this movie. It's very different from other &#34;vampire&#34; movies and it is not a &#34;scary&#34; horror but an excellent one.
B00B2V66VS|5|this game is way better than the first and if u want to get this app don't think twice before downloading.
B00NJT3A5Q|5|Incredible...
B00GRVEDCM|5|Very nice, though recently I haven't been able to go 5 minutes without seeing the same cards. Mainly Marzhin and The Claw. This really irritates me, but I probably just suck at this game.
B00G3L6KQI|5|Great book, as are the other two in this trilogy.  A great find.
B001NKI60W|5|My daughter has this movie, as well as the songs, memorized. She'll often stand in front of the television mimicking the cast.<br /><br />The story is excellent, and even though Pierce Brosnan couldn't sing his way out of a subway, I don't believe there's a woman alive who would ask him to stop. There's a magical chemistry between these players and Meryl Streep has an incredible singing voice. A great movie with a win-win for everyone.
B00SJFV6ZG|5|FINALLY! Proper packaging from HBO! PLEASE release the rest of the seasons in standard BD cases like this!
0307891372|4|Well done... humongous but easily searched through. One of the better guidebooks I've seen. There's a separate section for all of the map walkthru's and the pull out map has all of the sites marked in case you miss one traipsing around.
B00W3V83QW|5|This is a great game<br />I love it!!!!!!
6305784116|5|For Disney lovers or simply animation fans, this is a superb movie, as well as to any cinema admirer. <br />The movie itself is very charming, and it has comedy and fun in the right proportion, including the magic romance beteween the sofisticated cat lady high class Duchess and the O'Malley street smart cat. The kittens come along with their inocence and childhood. <br />Do not wait much to get this wonderful movie in your dvd collection.
055321263X|5|Like so many other reviewers, I had never heard of Wilkie Collins until I got my Kindle and it was on the \\"free\\" list. A truly engrossing and amazing book, surprisingly modern despite its being written in the late 1850s. The text is quaint, but what I mean by modern is it's subtle humor set against the mystery, such as in the character of the uncle Mr. Fairlie. I found myself laughing out loud in some places. Wilkie Collins has carefully fleshed out all the characters with depth and believability. The only stereotypical character is that of Sir Percival Glyde as one of the antagonists- a charismatic individual who is, of course, hiding his true nefarious self. It is an engrossing mystery that was very difficult to put down-I read it while eating, instead of watching TV and into the late hours of the night. I could not wait to find out what the SECRET was! At times I would think I had figured it out, only to be thrown off again. Written in the first person by several of the characters-in the form of biography, journals and depositions, gives the book its depth. Wilkie Collins, in real life, was sympathetic and passionate about the lack of women's rights in the nineteenth century and he uses this book to illustrate some of the injustices afforded on women. Since this was first written in serial form, it must have been torture for his readers to wait for the next issue to be published! I highly recommend this work, even to those who don't particularly care for 19th-century novels or mysteries.

B00DR0PDNE|4|I love the chrome cast, only gripe would be that it doesn't work with a lot of the apps that I use.
B003XF1XOQ|4|It was a great book but it was very sad. If you don't like soppy romance books this is not for you.
B00BB8RKH6|5|No one does swagger like Denzel and you add to that a uniform and a hat, and it only increases his ability to project consumate arrogance and conceit.  He plays this role to perfecgtion. It would be difficult to imagine who else could pull this role off.

7885142434|5|shows how a marial artist goes from riches to starting over because of his ability to start over in another place because of his life experience. I especially like the ending when Bruce lee as a child is revealed  and when he turns 16 becomes his student.
B00001U0E1|5|Who but Stoppard would think - or dare - to make a movie about the creative impulse itself? Why and how we transmute our experiences and express them in art, is the most exciting theme of this magnificent movie. Along the way he spoofs show business, creativity vs. money, and romance. There's the pageantry of the period piece, the sometimes slapstick humor, the love story, the tragedy, the \\"the show must go on\\" triumph, and most of all a reverence and wonder for the impulse that makes us spin all our trials and triumphs into gold.     With Stoppard, as always, you get an almost frightening attention to detail - there's never a wasted second in his work. For instance, there are several close-ups of Will's hands, which are stained as dirty as a field-hand's with ink: word-smithing, like blacksmithing, is hard and dirty work.     And the entire piece is crafted like one of Shakespeare's plays: there are many levels to appreciate, but he never forgets to \\"play to the pit\\" -- to have lofty and earthy moments, something for everyone.
B007J4T2G8|2|I read all 3 of these. I have this OCD where I have to FINISH a story if I start it, despite whether it sucks or not.<br />I disliked the blatant copying of the Twilight characters, mannerisms and story lines. I also thought the writer was awful. She really lacked the depth of vocabulary to stop her story from feeling repetitive. Every sex scene (there's like 5,000) ends with &#34;And then he found his release&#34;. Guh, I wanted to puke every time I read that. Real creative.<br />With some serious editing this could have been a pretty decent story line. I found out later on, this is Twilight Erotica Fan Fiction. I probably would have been less disappointed if I knew, going into it, that she intentionally copied Stephanie Meyer. I suppose I feel like if you're going to bother publishing your own book, make sure it's YOURS. Too much piggy-backing on the hopeless love story Meyer wrote.
B00004XPPE|3|The scene missing from this edition shows the control room and a small wisp of smoke coming from the computer bank.  One airman accuses the other of smoking while on duty.  They leave the room.  There was a failure in the computer room, and that caused the fail safe mechanism to fail.  Without that scene, the edition is lacking.
1449410243|4|This book is hilarious! Its super funny and makes me laugh all the time. But I was kind of disappointed that if you look inside, it gives away most of the chapter of How To Tell If Your Cat Is Plotting To Kill You. But really, this book is really great and I'm pretty sure that anybody/everybody would enjoy it. Keep it coming, Oatmeal! Your site and products are amazing!
B00BD99JMW|1|Teenage romance novel with a terrible ending.

B00ILHW6AG|5|Wow! I'm still living in the world he created here-This one really grabbed me- I felt the \\"old\\" Stephen King in this and couldn't read it fast enough, in fact I read if so fast that I may have to go back and read it a second time, but more slowly. I loved the character build, the story and the way it all just \\"fit\\". I read this book in less than two days, I purchased yesterday afternoon- and I just finished it about an hour ago, and I'm still sort of \\"there\\" in my mind- mulling over the events, the characters, the moments that really stuck with me.The Pastor is intriguing and I do wish there would have been MORE there in regards to his progression in character- additionally the ending was while incredibly gripping somehow not QUITE just right somehow- but that is likely all personal preference based, and the entire thing is written beautifully and with the real grip on a reader that very few authors can maintain throughout a book. I don't know about everyone else, but I found this book absolutely riveting right up to the very last word- and once I read that, I think I  must of just sat there for a few moments, trying to accept that the ride was over. Excellent book-
B002U3CCF6|1|I found this book very disturbing. Not as good as Gone Girl. Don't hink I will read any more books by this author.
B0006399FS|1|The Same Identity: An overexposed artist aging badly.  U2 have achieved cult status among world's music, but now they're turned down major international music company offers, as Elvis did by 70's.    This album is just full of clichs and Pop Stars sunglasses. How To Dismantle whatever is plenty of tricks and treats. The \\"new\\" video All Because Of You says it all: A joke of themselves. They still think they're playing Where The Streets Have No Name at the rooftop. Tragic.    Avoiding the hype altogether, \\"How To sell propaganda and iPod\\" is certainly an ominous omen for the band's fortunes. The record is the group's weakest effort in two decades.   Scheme is the same: whole chunks must be copied but hidding that evident lack of creativity by marketing the failed album as \\"instant classic\\", \\"return to their roots\\", etc. That's enough to sell millions, after all they're \\"U2\\". At least that's what they want us to think.     They pretend to be U2, but they aren't U2 anymore. They are a portrait of their artistic decadence.

B000K7VHQE|5|This is a great movie! I wasn't to thrilled about seeing it in the theatre, but then after I did I couldn't believe how funny it was! It's important to have a great sense of humor when viewing this and an open mind is a must!
039334505X|4|I was very satisfied with this product, the book arrived in very good condition and fully worth what I paid for it.<br /><br />The shipment arrived at my house faster than I had been told, which was a pleasant surprise.<br /><br />I am very happy to have found the book on Amazon.com, because I was dying to read scagboys and in my country goes on sale until next month.<br /><br />In short, I am completely satisfied and would definitely buy from the same seller again

076790592X|5|This book is so touching. Mitch was blessed to know Morrie and we are blessed to have this book. There are many pearls of wisdom in Tuesdays with Morrie. It forced me to take a look at my life and ask what things I should REALLY be concerned with. After this, read &#34;You learn by living&#34; by Eleanor Roosevelt and you will be on your way to becoming a better human being!
B000056HE9|5|Love this movie! It's not Christmas without it. Nostalgia with a moral. Well worth viewing.
B00003CWPR|5|Stanley Kubrick's last film isn't meant to be viewed as an erotic film, it's a film about dreams on a Freudian level. If you look closely, you'll notice that there isn't a single frame of film without the colors red or  blue; Freud wrote about the two colors and their relationship between  reality and dreams. <br />This film is poetic in every sense...Wellesian,  Kafkaesque, and Freudian. A masterpiece.
B001NAT07A|4|I wanted to show my daughter this movie.  It isn't as I remember it.  The video quality was exceptional.  I don't think she liked the movie itself.
B00946WM6Q|5|Excellent film!  My favorite Bond movie.  Love Daniel Craig.
B009G41CG2|5|Great free app. Great for killing time. I like the fact you can enlarge the game for easier play. Highly endorse.
B0002OERI0|5|Granted, I am no professional musician, but the amount of time I have spent listening to music is quite considerable. The review prior to this one noted that very very few people who like this album could have any actual experience listening to amazing music. Well, I would consider myself that. I have listened to every Led Zeppelin album, I have all of them, they still remain my favorite band. I also have a plethora of live music from them. In addition I  have every Pink Floyd album, which I also have tons of live music, most of which is bootleg. For a long time I thought Green Day was terrible, and shared much of the same views as the reviewer prior to this one. Unfortunately, it was ignorance that blinded me. I pushed every emo band, every punk band, and many others into a taboo zone inside my head, in which I would refuse to admit any of it were good. <br /> <br />You have to understand that not all music has to be complex to be good. People tend to think that simplicity means idiocy and ignorance, and only the truly intelligent use complexity. In reality the most beautiful of creations, the most beautiful ideas are the most simple. I think it was Einstein who said that we should make things as simple as possible, but not any simpler. Einstein was not alone in this idea, many of the greatest men in history have deemed simplicity as beauty. I am not saying that since much of Green Day's music is relatively simple it must be good, I am simply stating that complexity does not mean good. <br /> <br />Now, to my review of this album. I got this album from my girlfriend soon after it came out, naturally, since at that time I dissaproved of Green Day and all music of the like, I didnt even bother listening to it. It was not until this past month that I listened to it, and I havent stopped listening since. The first 4 songs on this album are some of the best music I have heard in a long time, especially of new bands.  <br /> <br />I would be very suprised if another album came within this year to topple this one. <br /> <br />Of course, since this album is intended for the anti-government crowd, if you are one of them you will drool over some of the lyrics. I am an anti-establishment junkie myself, but I know that you do not need to be to enjoy the music, as long as you have ever been in an unfavorable situation. <br /> <br />Even if you are like I used to be, and my friend here who reviewed prior to me, I call out to you to buy this album and just listen to it, really listen, dont assume its just some junk punk-rock crap. <br /> <br />A big determiner in musical ability is the ability to have smooth transitions between tones and meanings within songs, while changing the instrumental accordingly, and throughout this entire album this is done. It is truly a masterful piece of music. <br /> <br />I recommend this album to everyone.

B00005OM4N|1|Once again, Britney has unleashed her tedious muck upon the world.  No doubt every 9-12 year old girl with hormone problems will desire to own this one, plus its companions in the upcoming merchandising campaign.  At least it has educational value--At least this way, our young future women will know how to behave like (...).  I don't have any particular problem with Ms. Spears, and this is because my problem is with the music, which she has absolutely nothing to do with.  If there were actual instruments on her albums, they might be bearable, but they are merely an incessant cascade of bleeps and bloops and electronically synthesized mediocrity.
B007VUA7VO|4|This app is a great app for telling if your Kindle Fire HD is really charging. It color codes certain temp levels so you know when it needs to cool off. My charge doesn't last all day if I am constantly using the Kindle but that's expected. Main point I think it is worth having.
B009AZZ6H8|5|Soundgarden to me is one of the bands that I wish I could be in if I had any talent. You know how in your head you make up this cool-ass group of  dudes who have a God given ability to entertain millions and you are in it! And of course you have such an incredible voice that you don't even have to play any instrument even though you can. Yeah that's this band.

B004LOMB2Q|5|Love love love this app. I write and I love the fact that I can have the book I am working on and all of my research at my fingertips no matter where I am or what device I have with me.  I have it on my phone, my kindle, my nook, my computer, and even my boyfriends laptop!  I have tried other writing apps as well as other storage like google docs, onecloud (or whatever it is called now), and drop box but nothing was this easy and I love that I can just use the web clipper to save whatever I research I find on the web!  I love that I have multiple notebooks, one for each story and I can take pictures with my phone or kindle directly through Evernote and save them to whatever notebook I need to!
0446677450|1|Even by the low standards of pop business tomes, this book is pretty poor. Kiyosaki, with co-\\"writer\\" Sharon Lechter, affects a breezy and remarkably unsophisticated manner as he throws out pronouncements on personal and business financial goings-on.    An interesting contrast to Kiyosaki's book is Andrew Tobias' \\"The Only Investment Guide You'll Ever Need.\\" Tobias -- who (unlike Kiyosaki) can actually write -- also affects a casual manner. But whereas Kiyosaki comes off as merely callow, Tobias' tone is intended to lighten and have fun with his sound and tough-minded advice.    Though an amiable book and not without the occasional sound nugget of advice (e.g., curtail spending on worthless gizmos), \\"Rich Dad, Poor Dad\\" offers little in the way of help for us everyday folks. A big focus is Kiyosaki's own alleged success in real estate investing, a notoriously risky field even for seasoned investors, and one he passes off as a cinch.    Annoyingly, Kiyosaki refers throughout the book to his own father as \\"poor dad\\" and to a childhood friend's father (and surrogate father to Kiyosaki) as \\"rich dad.\\" \\"Rich dad\\" is honored for his bland and meaningless pronouncements as a Yoda-like fountain of wisdom.    Meantime, Kiyosaki's animus toward his financially underperforming father always lurks, making \\"poor dad\\" (clearly contrary to Kiyosaki's intent) a sympathetic figure. In any event, both \\"dads\\" are underdrawn and the book itself is undercooked, its advice unrefined and at times obvious.    It's hard to see what Lechter, a CPA, adds. Wouldn't Kiyosaki have been better off with a ghostwriter who can actually write? The book feels as though no professional editor even read it, much less took a pen to it.    Throughout, Kiyosaki's leaden tone and nonexistent wit are displayed, permitting statements like the following without a hint of irony: \\"The problem I sense today is that there are millions of people who feel guilty about their greed\\" (pg. 158) and \\"Don't listen to pooror frightened people\\" (pg. 170).    At one point, Kiyosaki even tells a professional reporter, \\"I am a terrible writer\\" (pg. 132). Yup.

B000002J1Y|5|I had been, more-or-less, a passive Yes fan until  I heard &#34;Starship Trooper&#34; on Yessongs. I bought that album in what I believe was a vynil, double album format shortly thereeafter. After a house fire destroyed it, I bought a replacement on cassette. But years later, after dubbing the cassette to my computer's hard drive, the &#34;wow, flutter and hiss&#34; found on a cassette that old became very apparent. It was tolerable until I bought a couple of their remastered CDs. That's when I decided that my favorite album of theirs should be of better quality and bought Yessongs&#34; on CD. A very good decision that my ears truly appreciate!
B00CNQ7HAU|5|I am a mid-western transplant to the south and the very essence of this culture has been captured in word by the author.  I feel as though I know the characters.  Could not put the book down!

B002MQYOFW|5|Really enjoyed the story and it kept my interest.  Very quick read.  Like these types of novels, kind of scifi stuff.  Looking forward to more novels of this type.  Great read.
0060005696|4|An excellent, eye-opening book on how an over-abundance of choice can actually harm us. Although it does get redundant because of the countless examples provided, Schwartz does this to further prove his theory that the amount of choice is overwhelming us in every aspect of our lives. Schwartz could have written this just as well as an article, not a whole book. Nevertheless, still a must-read that would forever change one's perspective of society

B000003S0R|5|This album is certainly strange, weird and demented, as previous reviewers mentioned.  But it's still accessible.  The album's tunes are too smart for radio, but don't be shy about getting it, even if you're  cerebrally-challenged.  This is a very diverse collection which delivers an  enjoyable listening experience without relying on studio sheen.  You may  not make heads or tails of the lyrics, but if you are a fan of music,  you'll like this one.  If you are capable of enjoying Sgt. Peppers, you'll  be able to enjoy Taking Tiger Mountain. <br />A favorite of mine is  &quot;Mother Whale Eyeless,&quot; which in its climax features a chorus of  childrens' voices over an urgent, carnival-like keyboard procession.  Of  course, these children are made to sing nonsensical lyrics.  The opening  track &quot;Burning Airlines&quot; is a fresh, pleasurable guitar pop song.   &quot;Third Uncle,&quot; which was subsequently covered by Bauhaus, would  make a perfect soundtrack to the apocalypse, especially in the deadpan  manner in which Eno performs it.  Very few of these tunes disappoint; the  ones that do are catchy and will nonetheless take residence in your brain  for long periods of time.  If you don't own this album, go get it right  away.<br />Highly recommended.
B00GR5MZIC|5|Daphne Du Maurier knew how to write a great story.  She wrote many!  And unlike a lot of authors today, her stories are not formulaic -- same basic story, insert new names.  I was captured by this one from the first page and it didn't let me go until the conclusion.  If you've been considering reading Jamaica Inn, I say DO IT!  You will not regret spending the time.
B005LAII8A|4|&#34;Looper&#34; almost passed completely under my radar. I am so glad it did not do so. At it's heart, it's a time travel movie with an interesting take on the concept. However, it is so much more than that.<br /><br />Joe is a Looper, an assassin hired by the mob to kill people they send back in time. You see, time travel is possible - in the future at least - but also illegal. So the mob uses it for one purpose: to kill people, and dispose of them in the past. Loopers do this killing, until the day their contract is closed by their own future self being sent back and killed - by their own younger self. When Joe's future self comes back and escapes, there is a race for young Joe to &#34;close the loop&#34; and the mob to catch both Joes. But old Joe is a man with a mission, a mission that goes beyond mere survival...<br /><br />The film ends up becoming about far more than time travel, as a mystery begins to unfold, hard choices are made, and a genuine moral dilemma appears. The story does not go where you expect it to, and even at the end you may not be entirely sure what young Joe is going to do, when he begins to put it all together. A great sci-fi movie, well worth checking out.

B001NFNFNU|5|To me the first part of this movie is the most interesting. The police officer coerces Mrs. Collins to take in the changeling. When she insists it's not her son the officer has a shrink mind-gaming her in her own house. \\"He has grown shorter,\\" the shrink says. When that doesn't work either the officer uses Psychiatric Reprisal. And Mrs. Collins ends up in a mental ward. Away with the troublesome and independent-minded single mother.... Today they will drive you to either suicide, destitution, insanity, commit a criminal act (prison time) or turn you into one of them. Coerce you to become a spy, stalker or to conformity - submit to the norms. (Notice the Reward & Punishment Game in the Lockshin's story. The Lockshin's are at first Rewarded. Pay-raise, friends, fancy parties etc. The idea is to make them conform. Drop their belief-system and become \\"good citizens.\\" When that doesn't work the harassment-attacks are escalated which forces the family to flee the country. (Remember Jean Seberg fled abroad too). Mind Control and Psychological Warfare are very subtle games. The more subtle the better. If exposed, they turn out to be twisted and shameful games. Stalking is a pathetic behavior).

B006QNDDHW|4|I purchased this book on a recommendation of a PowerPoint guru. What's most helpful from this book is the design tips including color, layout and flow. I'm a pretty good PPT builder already, this just helped fill in some shortcomings in my graphic design toolbox.<br /><br />I will be a better designer for having this reference.<br /><br />On a side note I purchased the Kindle version first. I returned it because it was not really a Kindle text-based book. It was a collection of page snapshots. Even the Table Of Contents was an image and didn't include links to the chapters. I returned it the same day and purchased the hard copy. Figured if I was going to have to look at pictures, it's better on paper pages than a kindle screen.

B00GH4RKYM|3|We really enjoyed the back-stories and the relationships that were established.  We do love good action sequences as much as the next &#34;guy&#34; but it was OVERKILL towards the end and seemed to never end.  I kept looking at the clock.  I wanted more story-line and less CGI-drenched scenes.
B000MGVCFY|5|Is it possible that with the three different mixes available on these SACD hybrids that certain folks are listening and reviewing the wrong versions?  The 16bit CD version is most likely the one to be neglected in mastering on these re-releases- as the main focus was the Super Audio 24/96 and the Quad (surround) mixes 4.0. The 16bit CD version was included just so it could be marketed as playable on a wide variety of systems. To hear the supposed ultimate stereo version you must have an SA player hooked up properly. I get the impression that the 16 bit CD version was treated to the aweful maximum loudness routine without much attention to its skewing of the delicate moodies mix. Whereas the SA 24/96 version was left to it's natural state. I must admit that with all the repetitous liner notes... one would expect that they would tell their devoted audience of fans who have bought these records several times over, what the process was that presents us with these new versions. What a glaring omission and quite honestly insulting! This is a very confusing time to be a music consumer... the manufactures seem to want us to be in the dark as they are chasing money making scheams over truly caring for these archives. Big business gets us again.. excuse my cynic ... sometimes he's out of control! Quality control was lax on these releases and it was an easy way to make money without having to actually remix these albums from scatch into 5.1 surround (spending hundreds of thousands of dollars)... Hmmm... Let's just use the old Quad tapes! That's suspect right there. I suppose if the surround format continues to grow, they plan on re-releasing it again finally remixed for surround and not an easy and cheap quad left over. Sometimes I wish I could figure out a way to watch over this so it's done for the fans who buy it and not the execs and management who profit from it. I love the Moody Blues but I am disappointed in this low budget attempt at throwing us scraps. Even the coverart quality looks second hand. Somebody in the Moodies camp must care!!! ...STEP UP my friend!!!! It is like spraying windex on the mona lisa to clean it up? Cut it out!!!!

B004Y6CS8I|4|I am an avid YouTube surfer but I hadn't crossed any music by SBTRKT until a trip to Australia, as a matter of fact I mistakenly had thought I was listening to MSTRKRFT for awhile. I would definitely compare this artist to James Blake who is one of my favorite singers by far, unique voices for their music type, SBTRKT being a bit more in the electro-dance genre. Two heavy hitting songs on this album for me were &#34;Hold On&#34; and &#34;Wildfire&#34;, I would definitely give those a listen before purchasing the entire copy. While I have heard this CD countless times I have never actually owned a copy of it. So in my process of figuring out whether to buy the digital copy from Amazon or iTunes I found for $9.99 the iTunes version offers an additional 2 bonus tracks (13 Tracks altogether). I am not the type of person who buys albums often unless they make a huge impression on me so it's very rare I purchase the complete work of most artists I like, this is one of those rare occasions.

B000000OAC|3|I love Queen. They are my favorite band, but I don't understand why so many people feel that this is their best, or one of their best albums. I understand that it contains as many different genres of music as have ever been packed onto one album, and that this album contains the invention of arena rock (\\"We Will Rock You\\", \\"We Are the Champions\\"). However, two great songs cannot make an entire album great, not to mention the fact that until this album, Queen had almost always saved at least of of the album's better songs for the end, an here they get rid of the best two songs right at the begining. <br /> <br />Also, Queen has always incorperated many different genres into their music, but here, instead of mixing them to form new sound, they made the most cliche sounding songs possible for each genre. There are a couple of punk songs, the worst of which is \\"Sheer Heart Attack\\", there is a classic blues song (\\"Sleeping on the Sidewalk\\"), an island melody (\\"Who Needs You\\"), and a lounge-style jazz song (\\"My Melancholy Blues\\"). None of these songs are innovative in any way. It's as if Queen was tryingto say, \\"Hey, look at all the genres of music we can do.\\" On top of those, \\"Fight From the Inside\\" and \\"Get Down, Make Love\\" are fairly boring. \\"Fight From the Inside\\" also seems to be a pure reincarnation of Taylor's \\"Loser in the End\\" off of \\"Queen II\\". <br /> <br />Other than these, I liked \\"Spread Your Wings\\", but the melody at the beging is borrowed from the Beatles' \\"Rocky Racoon\\". Also, the piano and the melody to \\"All Dead\\" are great, but the chorus is so blad, it keeps the song from being great. My favorite song off the album (other than the first two) is \\"It's Late\\". This song has the power that was in earlier albums, but is sincerely lacking in this one. Still, it is different than what they had done on previous albums. <br /> <br />I guess i just don' think this ablum is as creative as Queen has the capibility of being. The four songs i mentioned earlier that were simple cliches of their genre could have been written by absolutely anyone. If you want a truely great example of Queen's early work, check out \\"A Night at the Opera\\".

B00005JOQS|5|Since I am a HUGE fan of Smallville, I just had to come see the movie when it came out. I went to go see it the second day it came out, and it was way better than I could have ever hoped. Some parts of the movie had me in so much suspense I was literally hanging off my chair in anticipation. The characters made the movie seem more real. I was especially surprised with Kate Bosworth. I did not think that she would portray Lois Lane right, but she proved me COMPLETELY wrong. Brandon Routh was fantastic as Superman. At first, I was a little upset to see that Tom Welling was not playing the part, but when I saw the movie, I was so much happier seeing Brandon play the part. You could not wish for a better movie. The actors and director outdid themselves. The music matched all the scenes perfectly, the sound was awesome, and the special effects were fantastic(I can't think of a better word). This is the best movie of the summer, hands down. This is a must see whether you're a Superman fan or not. You'll love it.

B000FC146C|5|This story never gets old for me.  I'm 67 and the first time reading was when Thorn Birds came out in 1977.  It was enjoyed by then a young 30 year old and made the rounds to the other girls in that beach house.  The second in 1983 when they made the story into a TV movie and I had to re-read  and make the comparison.  TV movies never are better than the books and this was no different.  The third was read in 2000 while recovering from an illness.  And the last was finished just last week.  March, 2014 I traveled in NZ to AUS and wanted to relive where the plot took place.  Re-reading TB was like reading it for the first time.  This story never gets old for me.

B004R1Q2EG|5|Commonly accepted research shows that people buy both on rational and emotional considerations. As a marketer, it is a challenge to brand a product solely on rational aspects. People bond with brands and establish commercial relationships like they do with peers and lovers – the most successful of these are described in emotional terms. Noble Prize winner Kahneman describes two systems that are at play simultaneously in our minds. “System 1 is fast, intuitive, and emotional; System 2 is slower, more deliberative, and more logical.” This is the must read book for corporate and brand strategists. Underlying the author’s work is how certain constructs in our society bias us even before we cognitively balance the two systems.

0399103422|4|In Mario Puzo's The Godfather, he uses the crimes of a family and their Italian heritage to show how it affects a large loving family.  I thought this was an excellent book, because the plot sequence was amazing with constant twists and suspense.  The irony of this book comes through the crime boss Vito Corleone who is a kind-hearted and loyal friend of all who come to him with a request.  However, he makes his living off of corruption and death which really doesn't affect the reader's attitude towards this loving character.  The vicious side of the mafia comes through Vito's son Sonny.  Sonny's rage leads to the death of many mob-related characters as well as to the his own death  which is another irony evident in this novel.  The Godfather uses masterful description of each member's life and how mob-life affected them.  Another example of irony in The Godfather is the youngest son Michael's situation.  At the beginning of the novel, Michael is returning from World War II and has no part in the family business.  However, when his father nears death after gunshot wounds, Michael is drawn into the family business and chooses to pay back the antagonist Solozzo by spilling his blood for the sake of the family.  Michael becomes the leader of the family after his father and Sonny die and he returns from Italy after things die down about his assasination of Solozzo.  This transformation from an upstanding servant of the country to a crime boss looking out for the wellbeing of his family alone is the ulimate irony in this novel. Women and children are not major characters in the novel, because Puzo uses them to show how the mobs goal was to keep the innocent free from encountering their violent troubles.  Puzo incorporates the lives of everyone involved in this crime family to show how much love and loyalty lead to their success and rage and deceit lead to their downfall.  After reading the novel, I gained a greater appreciation for the movie which I had seen earlier and an understanding of how loyalty leads to power in the world.

B0000062FL|5|There are several great Santana albums, but I think this is undoubtedly best. As another reviewer says, it sounds very live;  it is not a \\"pieced together\\"-sounding studio album. The way the first half  flows together is mesmerizing -- seamless transitions of great music.    The best tracks include \\"Singing Winds\\", \\"Black Magic Woman/Gypsy Queen,\\" \\"Incident,\\" \\"Oye Coma Va,\\" and all the live tracks. This is a must-own if you are a fan, and if you just got onto Santana with Supernatural, then get this next; otherwise get it first.

0385486804|3|Reading this dramatic account of the life and death of a young man who sought a life of meaning apart from society, it's hard not to be moved and even inspired by his example of sacrifice. At the same time, I came away from &#34;Into The Wild&#34; shaking my head, both at Chris McCandless's suicidal stupidity and author Jon Krakauer's desire to paper over this fact in favor of making McCandless a kind of beacon to readers.<br /><br />After graduating with honors from Emory University in 1990, McCandless set off on a two-year trek to experience the great outdoors and apparently unplug from a family life he found unbearable. Dubbing himself &#34;Alexander Supertramp,&#34; McCandless wandered the United States, making odd friends and creating indelible impressions, until inspired by Jack London he set off for Alaska and the call of the wild, from which he never returned, dying from starvation in an abandoned bus located in sight of Mount McKinley.<br /><br />McCandless may have been fatally unprepared, but Krakauer's 1996 account, based on an article he wrote for Outside magazine, suggests a man with his head screwed on right and his values in line with the way he lived his life.<br /><br />&#34;The joy of life comes from our encounters with new experiences, and hence there is no greater joy than to have an endlessly changing horizon, for each day to have a new and different sun,&#34; McCandless wrote to one of the many people he befriended along the way to his death.<br /><br />The power of Krakauer's account lies in the plainspoken way he gives voice to McCandless's situation, his dreams and brave stubborn drive. But &#34;Into The Wild&#34; suffers from too much of this at the expense of a more sober-sided examination of what turned out to be a two-year kamikaze mission. Time and again, Krakauer portrays McCandless as a kind of moral adventurer, with an understandable need to test his limits, while ignoring the fact he wrote people postcards all but saying he was going off to die.<br /><br />Krakauer clearly identified strongly with his subject, a fact which becomes clearer when he gives a lengthy account of his own death-defying exploits in Alaska. But Krakauer went with a set objective, to climb an icy precipice, and took care to bring the proper equipment. McCandless didn't even carry a compass.<br /><br />Krakauer pads out his account not only with personal anecdotes but, more effectively, the stories of other ill-fated adventurers which hearkens back to a common thread of individuality taken to a fatal extreme. Overall, it's an account that many will find moving, but it read to me like a slanted portrait. Slanted by compassion, perhaps, but still frustrating that way.ied strongly with his subject, a fact which becomes clearer when he gives a lengthy account of his own death-defying exploits in Alaska.

1594488843|3|Author Daniel Pink attempts to close the gap between what science knows and what business does in his latest book Drive. Pink proposes that societies are analogous to computer operating systems and the Motivation 2.0 is in need of an upgrade (Motivation 1.0 was our ancestral drive for hunger, thirst, sex, aka Drive Reduction Theory as discovered by psychologist Clark Hull in the 1940s). He expounds on this metaphor and incompatibility throughout the book. For example, the \\"bugs\\" in our current motivation 2.0 are the \\"If then\\" rewards, e.g, If you complete this task then you get a reward. Most of us would refer to them as the proverbial carrot and stick.<br /><br />Pink reframes and relabels the classic Type A & B behavior and suggests we look further down the alphabet to new Types I (Intrinsic motivation) & X (Extrinsic Motivation)... Not necessarily new concepts, but new letters...<br />Drive as a concept dates back to Freud (Eros & Thanatos) and perhaps earlier, and Pink's Drive is replete with studies to back up this concept of what really motivates us.  He also spends a fair amount of time discussing Mih&aacute;ly Cs&iacute;kszentmih&aacute;lyi's [[ASIN:0061339202 Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience (P.S.)]], which makes sense since flow is about focused motivation and we all need to focus at this point in our distractive history ( I would refer to this as Emotional Adware--you heard it here first)---  I was glad that Pink steered away from Maslow's hierarchy of needs.  If he had expounded on that, I would have been demotivated (It is a tired reference in many business books).<br /><br />I do agree with Pink that the business world is changing and in desperate need of an upgrade since many employees are now dealing with less pay and less opportunity in this current economic climate, and the companies that nurture autonomy will thrive in the new economy. One cannot deny that humans, by their very nature, seek purpose and I personally agree with Pink that our default setting is autonomy--I know mine is.<br />In the final analysis however, Drive as motivation is internal and complex and the gap will remain open for many. You are the programmer in your personal operating system.<br /><br />If you decide to reboot or debug you personal \\"Drive\\" then Pink may offer you some insight. Maybe your system has just crashed altogether and it is time for a whole new motherboard (or personal change). It certainly gives new meaning to \\"I'm a Mac!\\" and \\"I'm a PC!\\" to take the computer metaphor a step further. We are all individuals that cannot be circumscribed by a concept, our code is more complex.<br /><br />In final computer jargon, this would be called \\"redundant code\\" (aka duplicate code),<br />and Drive still needs further analysis--a concept to build on, but not the definitive word. This is a Beta Version.ur default setting is autonomy--I know mine is.<br />In the final analysis however, Drive as motivation is internal and complex and the gap will remain open for many.

0743289412|5|2006 has been a great year for masters of the supernatural horror genre, but until now the master of them all hasn't put in a worthwhile appearance. Well that's all changed and how!   After a mildly disappointing recent effort by his own standards with this years earlier novel \\"The Cell\\" King was being overshadowed by the likes of Scott Smith, James Herbert and Cormac McCarthy. But now he's back to show everyone who exactly who does it best. Lisey's Story has a great many of the attributes a true fan of SK would associate with his work. There's the character Scott Landon who just happens to be an author for starters!  Anyway the story follows Lisey who was the great love of Scott Landon's life before his passing two years before the book begins. Well with Scott six feet under and Lisey all alone and mourning, along comes one of King's truly evil characters in the shape of Jimmy Dooley. Anxious to get his hands on Scott's unpublished works, this man will stop at nothing. King has brought wonderful dialogue, tension, suspense and all of the trademarks from his best work to the table in Lisey's Story. Essentially a fairly uncomplex storyline, the book's strength lies as always in the immense investment the author puts into his characters. Lisey's sister Amanda talking to her in the voice of her dead husband is a delightful intricacy for example. Every single one of the characters (no matter how minor they may seem at first) is multi-layered. Every line of dialogue is carefully fashioned, and every narrative paints a picture the reader can't fail to visualise in their minds eye. There have been many of Stephen King's books of late that have been referred to as a return to form. Personally I don't think he ever really lost it. If every book is a return to form then surely the form was never lost in the first place? The competition might be getting stronger, but no one is quite ready to knock the master from his rightful place atop the mountain of horror and suspense. At528 pages there is enough here to keep a reader occupied and enthralled for a fair few hours, days or weeks depending on whether you want to rush it or savour it. One thing's for sure though. No matter how long it takes to read, it's worth every penny.

B00A1EOBJQ|4|Good CD of the music from this great series. However this CD is light. It could and should have included more songs from the show. The volume 1 on the label is probably a clue the company will try to milk you into buying several volumes that clock in on a light running time. They should have waited until the season was over and then put out one disc for all of season 1. Hope there's going to be a season 2.

B000002H6C|5|Even with the absence of a bass guitar, this has to be one of Mettalica's best albums.  The absence of Cliff caused the band to think outside of the box to make up for what Cliff brought.  This album is the beginning of a period where Metallica was really exploring their musical identities.  Hits such as One and Harvester of Sorrow really showed how far the band had come and I think that this album had to be made in order for the band to continue to exist.
B00001PE4D|4|Amazon has already provided the plot so I won't rehash the details here. The surprise is in the actors. When actors will be measured against Faye Dunaway, John Malkovich and Michelle Pfeiffer they better be pretty damn good. To my great shock Sarah Michelle Geller, Reese Witherspoon, and Ryan Phillipe prove up to the task. They may not be quite as interesting as the more sophisticated cast of the older movie but they are very, very impressive. Sarah Michelle Geller. in particular, is a revelation. I would not have believed that she could play a role this nuanced, and this unlikable, with complete conviction. But she succeeds totally as the serpentine enitity who encourages the corruption in everyone around her.  Witherspoon is the \\"good girl\\" but she is smart and strong and eventually turns the tables on the Geller character with grim determination.  Phillipe is surprisingly effect as the upperclass preppie romeo/who is a completely repulsive character until he finds redemption by revealing himself in all his  spiritual ugliness to the one he loves.  I think this movie was more interesting because I had seen the older film. I would  strongly suggest getting both to heighten your enjoyment of each version of the story.  Parenthetically, Geller was exceptionally alluring in this project, a quality that I never saw in her other work.

B0090SI582|5|The Wolverine is a really fun action packed movie.  I'm very glad Hugh Jackman likes playing Logan aka Wolverine.  I don't see another actor doing justice for the character.  I recommend this movie to everybody who likes the X-Men movies and X-Men Origins: Wolverine.  Some things might be a be a little cheesy, but who cares.  These movies are suppose to just be fun and make you have a good time while watching them.  If you're one of those people who judge movies by every little thing that's not perfect then I don't recommend it for you.
B0027MJU00|1|All the D's (dark, depressing, desperate, dirty, degenerate, drugged,  ) make this a  very hard read.  There is never even a whiff of a normal life or home or situation  for a single character, and there are many. Everyone, main characters and lesser, are so flawed, so unlikeable, so disgusting,  that it is like being trapped in a  sick circus sideshow.  There's not one likeable or sympathetic character; every scenario  takes place in  the deepest poverty and filth, it was just difficult to keep going and several times I decided to quit, but did finish.  Like many, &#34;Gone Girl&#34; ( loved it) brought me to this novel but may as well have been written by anyone, there was no trace  of the same author here.  Dark Places is like having  the  scripts of every axe-murdered chainsaw-killer grade D movie thrown together and having to read them over and over.  Awful and such impossible, improbable situations, I have a suspicion Flynn wrote this in 8th grade, during Halloween.
