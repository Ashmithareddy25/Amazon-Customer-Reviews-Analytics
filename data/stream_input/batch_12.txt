B00NB808P0|1|After three top-off jobs on a golf cart containing six batteries, three cells per battery, the nozzle on this battery filler fell apart. I can’t use it to water batteries anymore, but it does work on potted plants.
B00DSD65DM|4|Good honest seller.  Great sticker.  Thanks.
B000S2SKIY|5|Ordered this part and it took care of my problem. Code po449 I would say excellent quality also.
B000ANEB9I|5|This was a  replacement for one I gave a way. Always works and as advertised easy to remove.
B00QHB1HQ2|5|The mats really upgraded my Pony's interior
B00DHQFOGE|5|Bought one of these for husband's 2006 Chevy Silverado! He said it was amazing and fits perfectly. I will upload pictures later!
B004NPUNQO|5|Pin point precision spray allows killing individual weeds (e.g. Carolina snailgrass) without killing the surrounding lawn grass.
B006WGAGUK|1|See photo:<br />If you don't mind a rusted, junk product, then by all means please buy this.<br />I installed this on my trailer and this is what it looked like after 3 months.<br />Not happy wasting the time to order it and install it.<br />Pros: cost, cheap, $5.<br />Cons: everything else.
B00RPEC1YC|5|This is VERY high quality oil. Its made by Idemitsu here in the US, and all the specs show that it is on par or better than other high quality oils. Oh, it works awesome in Glocks too!
B009Q7A3L4|5|works as good as the original
B00108CKIG|5|fits perfectly
B006G2MJZU|5|It*s excelent. Thanks
B00KMSH59O|3|Will not plug in most wireing harness
B002UC2TTQ|5|As described
B004Z9M7QC|4|its very nice
B00MB0D9G4|4|This is easy to install and it looks pretty good compared to other covers.
B00DELNHJI|5|Love it!
B00RW1MEWW|1|NOT WATERPROOF!!!  First slight rain the water soaked through and puddles up on my seat!  Also too big for SV650.
B000C40ST2|5|fit perfectly on my '90 4Runner. a little stiffer than stock shocks
B00D1SWJT8|5|work great
B005JU5WUE|4|Great Product. Well worth the money spent.
B00PZDAJVM|5|Great lights easy installation
B0009V1WS4|5|Great safety lock for hitch.
B003ZAEUE4|5|Works great for removal of rwd transmission
B000TVBHK2|3|Tried it on several surfaces before polishing. Couldn't tell any difference so I quit using it. Smells strong and will burn/react with some surfaces
B00JIARQ1O|5|Item works great easy to install
B00W8ADB1K|4|The product  was not as I expected  so the item itself get 2 stars. However  JACOs  customers  service  is amazing  and they truly  take their customers  satisfaction  to heart.
B008L12ECW|5|Working properly now happy customer. .
B00CMUBGWC|5|Arrived on time, installed easily, working great.
B000JZGN6G|5|Perfect fit as the OEM. My car is like new now.
B00O9H0QIG|1|Battery s are dead
B001C97ZVA|4|perfect fit
B00KTJ7U3M|5|They met all my expectations and we're a fraction of the price as the ones sold in stores. Easy to set to my car also. Got the direction fromy the paper that was sent and bam new keyless entry set.
B006FXHFMM|5|Easy install, look really nice on my EVO X thanks!
B00IKKS4W8|5|Very nice, delivered on time, high quality product & installed in ease. Definitely recommend to others.
B008N2JIRS|5|The filter itself is OEM so it's great.  However it took over two (2) weeks to get it.  Also, the original box it came in had been opened and taped shut.  Also the filter was slightly damaged but usuable.
B001UCEMUG|5|Exact fit replacement at far better than OEM price
B005S09XUA|5|Fit perfect, no road noise. I put them on myself, took about 45 min.
B00AEBAF8W|5|Perfect !
B010OYOHO6|5|Love the design of these headphones. They are light, and holds a whopping 8GB of memory. That's a lot of music!!!<br />I use my headphones when I am working out so the lack of wires comes in handy especially when it comes to doing squats<br />and other dynamic exercises. Easily charges by plugging into the computer via the usb cord. A good product. I forgot to mention these headphones also offer FM radio. Crystal clear so far on my end!<br /><br />I was given a pair of these MP3 headphones to use for free in order for me to provide an honest review.
B00BCRMC1U|4|they are very large for a Mazda Millenia and adjustment straps easily broken
B00YQFLISI|5|This sticker has increased the value of my vehicle.
B00JVHLS3G|5|Great Product. Fit perfectly and looks super.
B000C847FY|5|Great part
B002T47TZY|5|Good quality shock.  Good road feel.  For a couple of dollars more than the most popular brands (which are often a worse ride than the original shocks) you have a shock that is worth the guarantee, rather than a popular-selling shock with a &#34;lifetime guarantee&#34; that you get to replace for free every year.
B003E3K5E6|5|very good one fit good
B00AWXBOTG|5|Phenomenal concept, high quality, and perfect fit for my 2011 Ram 1500.  Dropped it right in, used my power screw driver to put in 4 screws and it was done in minutes.  It even leaves a little extra space between the safe and compartment lid on the truck to set small things like papers, smartphone, etc.  This extra space is great to keep spare/unnecessary papers to disguise the existence of the safe; would be better if the combo was set in and didn't stick up for complete concealment.
B00JA3BMDW|5|Have not actually needed it yet. Played with it a little and it appears to work great. Have not taken RV out yet but will be trying it out soon.
B001C8WP7U|2|Well... This is a ok pad if you use it on fast street driving. This is not a track pad, not at all. It will fade pretty quickly on racetrack, and it will no longer have the same braking performance even after it cools down. So nope. not recommended. get a proper track pad and play around.
B0087NB1IW|4|Hard to complain about this. Not missing out on much if you get this over the smh10, a little less talk time being one of the major differences. Still I can go about a week without charging, and its still ready to go.<br />Controls are very easy to use once you get used to finding them while riding (finding the jog dial is no problem, finding the red button requires some feeling around at first).<br />Easy to install (lots of extra wire in my case though).<br />The bad: At highway speeds (70mph here) it gets a bit hard to understand what is being said (on both ends apparently), and music is hard to decipher as well. I credit this to the &#34;mix&#34; for the audio. It seems to be only highs, with no low or mids. For this reason, at high speeds with the wind noise in the helmet, it gets hard to understand for me. I can hear no problem, just because it's all highs, it sounds very crackly. Lower speeds are no problem though. I don't usually start experiencing this until I get above 60mph.<br />Along with that, I'm told its hard to understand me at those speeds as well. I think this may be because I have to talk louder/yell (though there is noise cancellation that takes care of most of the wind noise). By talking louder, I assume I'm just blasting out the microphone.<br />Only other &#34;complaint&#34; is the voice command system (which I had to download an online manual to figure out since one was not included with my order). Use it by pushing the red button. After a short delay a (very loud) voice gives you prompts. It seems that it doesn't matter where your volume is at, these prompts come at you at full volume. For this reason, at lower speeds, the microphone hears itself and gets confused. It goes a bit like this, &#34;say call followed by a name or a number If you just said something I didn't understand&#34; (no pause because there is none). This is only at very low speeds though (or when stopped). When I've used this feature while going 25mph or more, it's flawless.<br />Overall, it's great. If you're look in for a Bluetooth and this is in your budget, get it.
B004U9B8O4|5|Great large size.  I can lock two bike together through a lamp post easily.<br />Super well built and strong.  Comes with four keys.
B00466L2GU|5|its a lot better then the old one I used don't have to leavel the legs thanks
B001KOIRPU|5|Nice addition to a terrible engineering design by Yamaha. Who wants to remove the pipes to change your oil. Fairly straightforward installation for a person that can follow directions. Their website also has videos of the installation process.
B007ZXXSHW|5|Perfect fit on my 2004 Elantra GT. appeared to be good quality and was delivered in a day.
B00MC72Q1K|3|They are nice and bright and a little longer than standard, however the units I received are not water tight like a standard bulb.  If your housings are not completely water tight these units may fail as they did for me. Had to return due to failure.
B006VEQB0W|4|Diameter of the tubing was smaller than expected.  I was hoping to use this to replace the gas cap vent hoses on two of my ATVs.  It is too small for that, and can only be used to replace vent hoses comping of the carb.  I use it eventually...
B008XB9BJY|4|Used in RV to replace standard 12v incandescent lighting bulb (less battery consumption).  The color of this bulb is great, nice and warm (very similar to the incandescent it replaced) - I bought a different LED previously and that bulb was way too blue.  Item was shipped promptly & plugged right in.  Only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is that I haven't had it running for very long, so can't speak as to longevity.  Like the color and energy savings so much that I'm gonna buy more.
B00T47KYZ6|5|This fan  was a life saver . My vehicle's A/C no longer works , this small fan helped to  keep me cool.<br />Worth the money if you have an older  make and model car  that lacks  the proper cooling system.
B00RW2JNTS|5|Perfect
B008AN4HBC|5|Excelente
B00B5ZYY38|5|Thanks
B00ODW3AF8|1|if you are buying for an Element, they do NOT fit. Customer service is worthless. Their solution is to squeeze socket tighter. Wasted money
B00NRVBKI0|1|There is a bug, not the kind that requested
B0082AMQ02|5|Nice product!
B004I0J9WS|5|Literally indistinguishable from the OEM part.
B000C17GC2|5|Excellent
B00514BPGI|5|Helped wide the boards. Easy install.
B0031I1ZUW|5|I purchased two of these for my Polaris Sportsman 450's, they were a perfect fit and I couldn't be more please especially for the price.
B004K8YK72|5|nice set up was suprised how easy it went on love it
B00A9T28QG|1|Wasn't a big fan of it. What I read on the website is not what it did. Just a waste of money and wish I can return it.
B00JXTXB96|5|Nicely made pipe. Took about 15 mins to install. Buy the gasket too which made a swap out easy. Went on wifes car and she likes the subtle tone
B0050VONTS|5|Very good product and quick shipping. Thank you.
B00V9FTQNC|4|It work very good for what I need it for.
B00TOVX0Q2|5|Looks great with Md. Americana Tags
B004KED8CO|3|Seems OK, tried it out, but haven't used it extensively.  The English/metric approximation seems adequate if not perfect.  I mostly wanted something I could spin, and this does the job.  Good cheap wrench for home tire rotation or swapping out the snow tires.  Better than flea market quality, but not professional grade either.
B00BYKJ254|2|I have put this product on my Nissan Pathfinder. Last evening the bulb came loose and burnt the headlight harness, otherwise as a product works ok , but may not install correctly. High and lows never worked. Trying to reach out to seller.
B001TF7V5C|5|If you have a dark colored colored car, buy this now! It has been the best paste wax I have ever used. Makes my charcoal grey Bimmer shine like there's no tomorrow. I followed my wife in my car the other day and she told me she couldn't look in her rear view mirror because the sun was reflecting so brightly off my car. That's shiny! And the depth of shine is great too. I paired it with some CG Black Light and some CG V07.
B003ZJ2HMM|5|This was the easiest thing to install, only 4 screws and looks great
B00DBEPFMA|1|Did not work in car bought for.
B004HL7YN4|5|My husband damaged his regular tailgate on his 2007 Dodge Ram 3500 with his trailer. This tailgate is light weight and a perfect fit. He is even finding that he's getting better fuel millage.
B00SK6YGVU|2|They have a bad smell and are very thin
B00P24PG9O|4|It's very cute, but it will not work for the 2015 or 2016 Mini coopers.  Sadly I have to send mine back because I have no use for it.
B003BL1H0M|5|Had this light bar less than one year and a few of the LEDs are not working..
B000GU3SEE|5|fantastic could'nt be better
B00XQVA6GI|5|I got this item in exchange of my review. I love this trunk organiser. With 3 kids playing sports, and grocery shopping daily, my trunk was a mess. This made my life easier and everything is visible and easy to find. I don't know how I was functioning before.
B00UMOGJ9U|5|Great replacement.put it on, 2 pulls, started right up.runs and idles like new....for the price, not worth rebuilding it yourself. 10 min job.
B0087OYNFO|5|2012 Subaru Outback 2.5i Premium Perfect fit, OEM can't be beat. Satisfied!
B00BFU4Q0O|4|Exellent  replacement fits well
B002R1MD8C|3|But it does look pretty good!
B00NMSF2P0|5|Work great!! Keeps plugs cool to the touch no melted ignition wires or boots, perfect for headers!
B00K9B9MFO|5|It sticks to your window or bumper. What more would you want.
B00IIM6DSU|5|Delivered as promised. I love this. Handles are sturdy so I can bring it in and out of my car. Can make the walls the size I need. Highly recommend.
B00DJACZ56|4|Great! I can touch steering wheel now,after sitting in hot sun.
B001F0MACK|5|Filter
B006DZ1NRK|5|Works great
B00BLPT7VQ|5|Exactly as advertised.<br />Very pleased with the transition
B002DPHDF0|3|good fit
B00DHPUYCE|5|Bought this for 2009 Lexus ES 350 and it is a perfect fit! I will upload a picture soon. It has been super hot lately and normally my steering wheel is super hot to touch -especially the wood part and the black leather seats were burning. Now I can touch everything and it seems my car cools off in less than 30 seconds. I should have bought one of these long, long, long time ago!
B00W5YE06E|5|Very nice, soft, supple leather. I use it as a bag on the back of my motorcycle.
B001CEI5GO|5|lasted for three seasons.
B00NWFJTK2|5|Perfect
B00EC2CG9U|1|These are pretty tiny, and the ends aren't crimped and don't stay put, so the hooks slide up and down the length of the cord unless there is tension on them.<br /><br />Lame bungies all around.
B003BNEHUW|5|Exactly the part I needed and it was easy to install myself.
B005DN1JKE|5|Awesome! Woke the 290k beast up. Feels like a 30hp gain, didn't change fuel mileage much.
B00080QHMM|5|Very nice.  Seems accurate since it agrees with other sensors on the tires.
B000QDZMAE|3|I use it to cover labels on my cameras. I don't need to advertise Leica to potential thieves. I wish it was available in shorter lengths.
B005JWEXZW|5|I love it because it's washable will recommend to others.
B00EIIH6PC|5|It works!
B005C5F5EE|5|grip donuts are grip donuts...these are grip donuts
B000O824Y8|5|Worked out just fine. No problems.
B0006IX850|4|as descrobed
B00B50HO7Q|5|Eliminates the vacuum poppet that is so troublesome.  The fuel output is on the wrong side but the hose reaches,  works great on my 97 king quad.
B008K18GL6|5|All good
B0014BIBGY|5|Great fit
B00199BXU2|5|Excellent, reliable product and great delivery with PRIME
B007ED9JFS|1|The eyes flaked apart and made the sun screen useless and my car messy.
B005EMGXUA|5|Worked great, had to use my original plastic locking tabs, but works great.
B000C9NMUE|5|no complains
B002VR58IE|5|Great product
B000GVM7CM|4|Easy to assemble. Make sure everything's reconnected before closing tailgate. Only downside is that lock holds on only one side. Would be more secure if there was a mechanism in place to hold both sides of the lock.
B005F6GY6I|1|Product is loose and a poor fit.<br />Removed them in a week!!
B001ACSQCG|1|*COMPLETE S*** *** Very low quality. Doors came with material on inside of doors sewn inside out. Looks like complete crap (pic attached). These must be factory reject kits. Steer clear.  UPDATE: Windows are half the thickness of old Bestop windows and the top material has stretched, in a single days use, so much that if I go over 50mph the roof peels up and won't stay in the groove on the front windshield.
B0009N0W60|3|i thought i was buying metal skulls but they were plastic
B002UJ13QO|4|Haven't used it but looks good !
B002QSD39O|5|So far so good. Time will tell for longevity. Haven't towed with it yet but noticable power on economy and tow modes. Nothing too crazy. Haven't run level 3 or 4 as tranny isn't built. Gauges with tuner are super convenient. Shipping was fast and no issues with the unit. Updating via the fusion software was easy but getting it to download was a pain. Had to use an old lap top running xp. Couldn't get it to take to win 10. Up and ru
B00E4U6PLA|3|Just installed the rears first. Look nice and easy to install. However, the self-tapping screws were too short, so I've got one loose screw on each side. They are a little longer than the original, but apparently not long enough to compensate for the plastic thickness. I'll have to search for longer screws. I haven't seen any comments about this, so maybe I did something wrong, but I can't imagine what.:(
B00030CXZM|5|High quality and the right price.
B00DSVMCQI|5|Nice/cool
B00ENBW7S0|2|Trigger hardware is too light metal and it did not blow well. I was blowing glass bead at 120psi. Sorry did not have good experiance.
B00O72R7Z8|5|Installed, works, what can I say about it? I will definitely buy it again!
B00ZWRGDFM|5|Provide great soft white light and the bulbs stay very cool.
B00LJ3C26M|5|Well it worked perfectly with the Griot's electric buffer.  Don't use this by hand!
B005ZRZWBU|5|Just what I needed
B00ASMXEZI|5|Very good battery.  Couple months no problems
B001EOV46K|5|Perfect fit with my new Curt trailer hitch. Seems well made, good for the price.
B00CASDZKC|5|I received my kick mats and they are exactly what I wanted.  They're made of a heavy vinyl so they can be wiped clean.  I have a 2015 ford explorer, they cover the back side of the front seats perfectly.  They are just simple and plain, no pockets!  Thank You!
B00029WVJW|1|I have replaced my glass mirror with a distorted faux-mirror. Enough said
B000TK5TLG|5|At 139 decibels I installed this on my 86 Goldwing. It definitely gets others attention.
B005FW3B7W|4|These lights looked great, but recently one of the leds went out on the left rear. Doesn't look as great when one of the lights are out. I contacted the seller to see if they are willing to work with me. The warranty is only 1 year -- If they say no, I would recommend not buying these unless you are looking dropping 200 on rears every two years.
B007GDNYJ8|1|This decal bubbled within having it on for 24 hours. Still haven't removed it from my rear cab window
B00OU5LOT2|5|Finally, I've found the solution to my long  time search of the perfect interior Leds for my car. After hours of searching through ebay, amazon, Google led me to a great review of OPT7 lighting kit. Skeptical at first it made be come a believer after visiting the website for additional specs.  This kit was delivered a day before expected and was shipped as if it were computer software. The kit has more than enough zip ties for a clean install. The leds have a strong grip tape and if used with the brackets included there's no chance if it becoming loose. I love the fact it comes with a Keychain remote as its high quality build and they've included a small Philips to open it up to place batteries. (Time saver) Thank you guys for bringing my Jetta to a nice glow while driving at night, well thought of packaging and instructions make it easy to install.
B008BVVY6O|2|They ripped had fix them ripped after month and head on front seat should be attached which there not.
B00M1OUBES|4|I haven't had to use the jump start feature yet but I like that this had the ability to charge USB devices (I'll try to update this with another star if it works or remove them if it doesn't). Its comforting to have the ability to get your vehicle started when out in the sticks. The LED flashlight is a little gimmicky but I can see it being useful in an emergency, imagine someone trying to find your vehicle in a dark field or parking lot on a moonless night and the strobe could be useful. The cable clamps are pretty beefy, most likely to be able to carry the high amperage that this pack claims to deliver.
B00AN3PW3Y|3|The quick connect feature of this harness is great. The only downside is that the harness wire for the passenger side tailight on my 2012 Dodge Journey was too short and I had to splice some cable and extend the line around another 12 inches to make it fit. Saw the same issue in another review, so I had the materials and was prepared for it. Other than that, seems good. I just don't think something that is advertised as quick should require splicing.
B00TJ19MNM|1|seat covers shipped in plastic bag no instructions only covers and two pkg of metal clips. tried myself for an hour to stretch the covers on seats did not fit. called company they said to return them asked for return postage they said they would email return label. didn't happen. tried one more time to stretch them on car with help of teenage son. finally got them on but they now have rips in seams due to poor stitching and all the tugging it took to get them on. they don't fit properly, are uncomfortable to sit on and the straps and hooks don't stay secured.
B00D4WN3Y6|5|great item. fits perfectly
B00II5YAXM|5|super
B000ELVILK|1|After a mechanic installed this alternator for me, when I drove home with the air conditioner on, I noticed that the fan increased in speed when I would accelerate. That night, I noticed my headlights would brighten when I accelerated. Two mechanics looked at my van (a Nissan Quest) and found out the alternator was not keeping the battery charged unless I was accelerating. Did I simply get a bad one? I've been told that it will sometimes happen, but I'm now faced with the decision of whether to get this one again or to go with another brand. Either way, I'll have to pay labor charges again. Very dissatisfied with the product, of course, but Amazon was great about giving me a refund.
B009JAEZH6|4|Ther gud
B000CNKUGO|5|Haven't used any of the material yet, but it is exactly what I wanted.  I brought it up to my northern Michigan cottage where we have several ATVs, dirt bikes, and boats.  These will be perfect when needed to make an immediate repair on the weekend!
B00VBJ8X58|5|Perfect fit and EZ install.  Worked great!
B000E683L8|5|Perfect, fit right in.
B004QJMG8A|5|Hands down Best correction compound on the market.
B00AC60VEC|5|Confusing at first but was able to figure it out by looking at videos.  Magnets will help but are not that strong.
B002YSCCRA|5|Worked fantastic on my 98 Lincoln towncar
B000VKVXTQ|5|Instructions were easy to follow
B00EDRA3FI|1|not the best fitting item .also no instructions  just parts.save your monry.
B000X3EPWS|5|JUst as advertised. (No rust)
B00B57WF0U|1|Did not fit properly
B00RT3QA5U|1|These are not convex curved mirrors.  They are flat adjustable ones.  They do not stay in place once pointed and do not provide the visibility the curved mirrors do
B000O0HOT6|5|Works like its supposed too.
B0089C061E|4|Wish I had known about this item before embarking on a road trip this summer. I didn't have any problem finding diesel fuel, but I did run into a couple situations where the pump nozzle didn't fit and had to improvise which was messy. I am now prepared for future encounters!
B00GIYQEWA|1|This wiper is not for outlander 2008 as they show on line ..waste of money!
B003YMALUK|4|These worked exactly as expected.  I used Lock tight red to make sure they stay.
B00W6IYO3S|5|Great fit
B0041MBAKW|5|Perfect fit in my 2006 F150. Went smoother than expected. So far it's holding up.
B004SZC0K6|5|Very high quality pile. Looks great in my '04 SVT Cobra. Can't beat the price!
B00VB2DG66|3|Could not tell a major difference in our van,  however the 12v outlets power down when the van is turned off, so we only can experience the effects when van is running
B000IY808M|2|Bought a pair of these at a good price compared to Subaru/Brembo STI rotors which cost ~$660/pair from an online discount Subaru dealer.<br /><br />they seemed to perform pretty well initially but I started getting severe brake shudder after using the rotors for about 12,000 miles. I checked the rotor runout with a dial indicator and it was 0.006&#34; which is twice the factory allowed spec. i ended up having to get the rotors turned (two cuts) to get the runout back within spec which eliminated the brake shudder.<br /><br />as far as appearance the black center section remained rust free through winter driving which included exposure to road salt.
B0110CO95S|4|Not bad overall the stickers were good , some were not PC or for younger children so adults may need to filter some of them are adult orientated.
B00TG05LO0|5|Every one that passes my car smiles when they read it. Of course I'm not driving. Very pleased with this sun shade.
B00DMEFI7Q|5|Love my new covers and the way they feel! Will definitely keep buying!
B0012NYGDQ|4|Great product.  Very well made.  Only one bad note.  The package of grease that was provided for proper installation was loosely place in the box. During shipping and handling the contents of the box crushed the package of grease and it was everywhere. Not to hard to clean off, but now I didn't have the correct grease for proper installation. :-(
B00P1N8QU2|5|Excellent quality. Did not fall apart in the wash as the ones I purchased locally.
B000C9JSBG|5|It worked!
B0034ZUZM6|5|works great
B006JYNEEK|5|Great spray gun. I tried out a co workers at the shop and had to get one for myself. I use it as my clear gun.
B000AUQM52|5|Awesome
B000EDQR8M|3|Just what I wanted
B003S1RQ2S|5|As advertised. Thanks.
B000FQ7R32|5|Fit good would buy again
B00GUIH1GW|5|perfect fits well
B000E35W1K|2|Not as good of a deal as we had hoped. The &#34;quick-grip&#34; style clamp is not strong enough to create the flaring required to make solid connections. We had to use an additional clamp to get the job done.
B00194939K|5|excellent worked great
B00O9H1JCS|5|Worked perfectly for my 08 Pontiac G8 GT. Way cheaper than dealer price.

B00FQT3U1Q|1|These arrived completely dry (and therefore utterly useless). I'm sure if there was some moisture in these, they would have been helpful, but I'll be going with the individually wrapped kind from now on.
B011C7SO16|4|SJBLZD telesc&oacute;pico Escoba con Quita hielo, by Xcdiscount .<br />Note: This is a product review only, and not an endorsement of the vendor. There may be less expensive vendors available.<br />This Snow Broom does take a bit of preparation after you buy it. The handle needs a bit a plumber's PTFE Teflon tape on the threads, to keep it tight. If that is not enough, you can cut or file a small groove in the handle at the top of the threads, and a corresponding groove at the top of the base grooves, and then screw in a short ½ &quot; sheet metal screw, or just tighten it and coat the connection with silicone glue or model cement. Unscrewing the steel extension for the first time does take a bit grip strength, but you can aid your grip by wrapping a few rubber bands around each section, or if needed, use two pairs of adjustable pliers. Avoid using vise grip pliers, as they might gouge or collapse the tubing. Adjustable pliers over the rubber bands, would prevent gouging the surface of the tubes. When you extend the tubes, do not overtighten them, as that may make them difficult to loosen again. Leaving the rubber bands on, or adding a coating of silicone glue, will improve your grip in the future. It is a shame that the owner has to go through all this preparation work prior to first time use, especially if it is still in the package when it snows, and you don't have the time or patience to fuss around with it in the cold air. All that being said, I still like the snow broom. It is solid, and the closed cell foam rubber blade will not peel off if it hits hard packed snow. I only gave it four out of five Amazon stars, due to the first time use prep work required.<br /><br />Ships from and sold by Xcdiscount<br /><br />© 2013 Snow Joe®, LLC, Edison, NJ 08817; Model SJBLZD; web: snowjoe.com; phone: 1.866.766.9563 M-F, 9AM-5PM; single item UPC Code: 0 56890 00313 9; Made in China.

B00CP1LUHY|5|Very happy with my purchase
B00KTIY4ZA|1|I recently ordered 2 of these for my 2002 Thundrebird.  Received them, opened the package, set them aside as I was involved in caring for a very ill family member.  When I finally got back to them I opened one up to replace the battery.... voila! All I received were 2 empty plastic shells that had no electronics in them - Count them 2.  Empty! No place to put the battery.  I got snookered.  Avoid this object. Unfortunatly I tossed the packaging and sales slip.  I cannot even give them one star.
B0036E9VB6|5|I bought this because my tire in my SUV got a nail in the sidewall.  The tire cannot be plugged.<br /><br />This product works fast.  It does not require much time to pump the tire up 10 lbs.  It might take 4 minutes.<br />It is much easier than to try to find a gas station with a free air pump.<br /><br />I found that the tire gauge does work within 5 lbs while the unit is pumping.

B0001CMUV4|4|Does a great job holding my hitch extender in place without rattling. One problem to watch for is that I stripped one of the nuts by overtightening. Now, I can't remove the nut and I need a long breaker bar to loosen and tighten it to my hitch extender. My fault, but I expected something stronger.
B003PJOLHG|5|fit perfect on a 2005 camry le, needed it for a bike rack, rock solid, and well built.
B004ZF39ZY|5|This HID unit is to replace another unit. I originally had the 1st gen HID conversion big & clunky from another company but worked. This unit is compact & easy to install. This was a quick install as I already had the electrical connections for this convention Kit. Just follow each unit remove & replace. I'm looking forward in ordering a 2nd pair as a back up just case.

B004MSJ7C8|5|I'm glad I purchased these gauges! I had actually attempted to cancel the order after buying them, and was going to try adjusting my carbs without gauges first. The order was already shipped, so I decided to just keep them and try them out. I had already adjusted my bike's carbs just by ear, listening and adjusting until it ran the best, while I waited a couple of days for the gauges to arrive. When they got here I connected them up just to double check, and found my high speed sync was very near perfect, but the low sync was quite a way off. So I started over and synced everything up the proper way this time using the gauges, and man does my bike run great now! :)<br /><br />As for the gauges, I can't compare them to any others since I've only used these. They seem to be made well enough, pretty much what I expected. The hoses included are plenty long enough. I hung the gauges on the handlebars of my bike, and had plenty of hose to reach both carbs. (It's a V-twin cruiser, VS800 Intruder) The brass fittings screwed right into my carbs. Having one long and one short was nice, the short was was a perfect fit on one carb, while it was nice having the longer one for the other carb to clear the frame on that side. It made attaching the hoses easy! The gauges bounced around quite a lot, too much for an accurate reading, so I installed the little plastic restrictors in the lines close to the gauges. They worked well and were easy to adjust.<br /><br />When I started to sync my carbs, I first checked the gauges calibration by noting the reading on each carb, then swapping the gauges around and noting the readings again. They were close but not perfectly matched, so I opened the gauges and used the adjustment to get them perfectly matched. The clear face just unscrews off the gauge, then the flat head screw inside adjusts the needle. It's quick and easy.<br /><br />I may never need them again, but they've already paid off and were worth the purchase. If I ever need to balance dual carbs again, I know they'll do the trick! My only regret is maybe not buying the 4 gauge set, but then again I'll probably never own a 4-carb bike... lolce dual carbs again, I know they'll do the trick! My only regret is maybe not buying the 4 gauge set, but then again I'll probably never own a 4-carb bike... lol

B00VLER9BM|5|[[VIDEOID:459d934b71b7fef73feb202fc643c99a]]Carfond's 7 Row Pure Handmade Sparkling Bling Bling Rhinestones is a stainless steel license plate frame. The license plate frame is accented wtih a pretty bow. This is a license plate cover for a diva or someone who loves pretty things. This license plate frame is classy, stylish, and very elegant. I was blown away before I ever opened the box! This frame comes in an elegant black box which is really impressive.    It only takes a few minutes to attach the frame. Remove whatever frame is on your license plate already and place Carfond's License Plate Frame on your car. When placing the license plate cover, remember to take the two little stud covers and pop out the ring inside of the round studs. This is how those 2 round studs will pop onto the frame to cover the screws. If you screw in the license plate frame first, no worries, unscrew it until you have enough screw showing to pop the ring onto the screw.  Also be careful when handling the license plate frame because the back of it is on the sharper side. Extra rhinestones are also included.    Overall, I am ecstatic about this beautiful license plate frame!! I love showing off my girly side and I love bling so this is a perfect match for my personality. There are several colors to choose from so it should be easy to find something that fits your personality. I would give this frame 10 stars if I could!! It is so chic and elegant! I received this product free in exchange for an honest and unbiased review. This review is my own opinion and what I truly thought of this item.
B00LNDJE5U|5|Excellent Product will buy agian
B00R26RCVK|5|This is the PERFECT thing for me to use after I leave hot yoga!  It keeps my new car seat dry and clean, and is easy on/easy off.  I have also started using it when I leave the beach when I am wet, sunscreeny, and sandy!  I love it!

B00KL3ALGO|4|These work fine except that kids just naturally want to remove them to see better. They can see fine through these but still take them off.
B000C55M7E|4|This is an original equipment replacement single rear shock for auto ride equipped trucks. I installed these on my 2002 Tahoe LT (with a 183k miles) with ease. The most difficult part of the job was replacing the compressor, which usually needs to be done as they are notorious for burning up when the old shocks go bad. If so you'll need the Dorman Model 949-000. The shop wanted $2500 to do the complete job; front & rear shocks, compressor and labor. This is insane. I spent under $1000 doing it myself in under 3 hours. In the end my ride is amazing with how responsive and smooth it now handles. Only reason for not rating it 5 stars is because they are still too expensive for what you get (at $200+ each) and the picture is misleading- you don't get the stock orange painted shocks; you get black ones.
B003U4O414|5|Works great in my 2011 Navigator. Highway mileage went from 17-18 mpg to 19-20 mpg cruising at 78-80 mph.
B00B9LM64M|5|This was an exact fit for my 2005 Nissan Pathfinder.  It took me literally less than 5 minutes to install.  It looks great and works well.
B003UTH088|5|Took less than 2 minutes to program.. Sweet!!
B004A2D6JQ|5|Original equipment, fast shipping simple replacement.
B0071CSN2W|5|Was very good and quick shipment
B001H1GQ7M|1|Extraordinarily poor quality.  I was spilling significantly more gas with this can than with the old style.  The &#34;Tang&#34; that is supposed to engage the lip of the tank  you are trying to fill is way too small and slips inside the spout.  So you have to pull it out and start over and gas spews everywhere.  If you are successful at engaging the tang and the gas continues to flow, it takes upwards of 5 minutes to empty a 5 gallon can.  I stopped trying to use the can and started using a special siphon hose sold in most hardware and automotive stores specifically to address this issue.  That worked for a while, but now the gaskets on two of the cans failed and the cap cracked on another one.  These cans are poorly made and the spouts are a safety hazard in addition to being difficult to use.

B00FJUZY8Y|4|Great item once assembled.  Needed to have my husband take over to get the legs attached.  Expected to have them join tightly but the legs and the opening seemed like the same size.  We had to start them in at an angle then bang them in straight.  The floor had rings of leftover plastic which was scraped from the legs as they were banged into the hole. No way you could take them apart again  however. ver. It will perform fine for the expected use.
B000GTX0XE|5|It replaced the (burned up) switch on my H-D Streetrod rear brake.<br />The V & H exhaust cooked the original switch, I just hope this switch holds up to the heat.<br />Time will tell<br />All things said, the quality of Goodridge equipment is what I wanted and the price was great
B00KQS6XH0|5|Very easy to program if you have 2 original keys. Great product!
B008IYHDV4|2|I thought I would save some money going with this replacement. My original master switch started to only open and not close the driver side window. When I first installed it, all the functions worked with an added bonus of the drivers window could now auto close. The original would only auto open but you had to hold it to close the window.<br />Unfortunately by the third week I started to have the same problem with now the passenger rear window (would open, but not close). If this worked, I would have given it a 5 star rating and it gets 2 because of the auto close feature.<br />I could not recommend this product though.
B00F52X712|1|Does not even come close to fitting for my car, even though it was supposed to.
B000EIVWSW|5|Has held up for a long time and seems pretty accurate.
B00843WA9E|4|i put slate gray with vertical lines on the floor of my duck boat.  it stains from grease/oil, & tears up from anything sharp.  after 1 summer, it still looks good, but does have a few stains & one tear.  mud & blood wash off easy if you don't let it sit & dry out.  it really quiets the noise if u drop something, your dog walking around, etc.  i wish it came in wider sheets, i had to put a seam on my floor which is why i used the lines pattern, you cannot see the seam so that worked out, just would have been less work to install if the sheet was wider...overall i like the product a lot, i wish it came in camo like hydroturf, or tan/dark brown because i did not want black, but i used the &#34;slate&#34; gray to match the yamaha outboard...the &#34;slate&#34; gray is not very slate, it is light gray, slightly lighter than the yamaha, but matches a dark gray tempress hatch about perfect.  blacktip's slate gray is not dark, i would call it gray as opposed to dark gray...apparently Tempress & Blacktip have the same (and incorrect) idea of dark gray lol.  this is basically the same thing as hydroturf at a lower price without as many options on the cut patterns for grip or colors like camo/tan/brown & minus the ridiculously overpriced hydroturf shipping fees.  Blacktip sticks very well, which will become a problem once it is all torn up in a few years I suspect...but that is the case with any flooring like this, having to rip it out & stick new down on top is to be expected with this type of product on a duck boat. i would definitely buy again, and when budget permits, i will be putting this on the sides of the hull as well.  it feels great on your bare feet & gives loads of grip.
B00HPTLO2M|5|Good very original and pre oiled.
B00YGJE7FK|3|It doesn't work well on the passenger window of our Ford Escape. Manufacturer said he is sending a new model to replace this one. I have not received it as yet.

B003R3SMI4|5|Fit good on my 2009 Honda CR-V

B003YPAU62|5|Brand new, no core hassle,  Works fine puts out 14.2v with high beams on, AC on and fog lamps on and the lamps aren't dim so I know there is plenty of current.  Works just like the old one did before it broke.  Seems to be quality constructed.  Time will tell of course but for now this is great and at a good price.

B0083C4C6K|4|I would have given five stars as it is a great bag but the shoulder strap attachment rings/tabs are unusally placed. If you hang the bag by the shoulder strap it hangs, in my opinion, upside down. What I mean is the zipper is facing the ground and the logo is upside down so it looks a little funny.
B00HS9FU6U|4|Great sticker, envelope was wrinkled when I got it but I'm sure that was postal office not sticker company. Coolest star of life sticker by far
B007ZCQD9S|5|Accomadating throttle and cruise with the bracket provided took some fabricating, after some head scratching!
B0042H6BA0|2|Used this bag on a 3,000 mile trip through the Southeast in August. The bag worked as advertised on the first leg of the trip, held tight to the roof and kept things dry through some minor thunderstorms.<br />1. First problem came about when tightening the straps down after a camping stop in northern Florida. A section of one of the plastic buckles that tightens down the straps broke off as I was strapping the roof bag to my vehicle. This made it impossible to tighten the bag down as advertised. I managed to do a work around by making a knot with the strap, and this kept the bag held down, but made the journey up to South Carolina a little nerve-racking. To be clear..... the buckles on this product are cheap, plastic garbage. Metal buckles would make this product much better.<br />2. Second problem was that I started having water leak in where the straps came into the vehicle on the door frame. During heavy rains on the tail end of our trip we noticed significant water leaking into the car through the area where the straps came into the vehicle. This was a problem as my 2 year olds car seat became soaked during one trip.<br />3. Third issue: Not sure how exactly it happened, but water leaked into the interior of the bag during the last day and a half of the trip. I made sure that the zipper was completely closed and the protective lip folded over it during the last pack up..... so I am not sure where the water came from. Did have a centimeter of water pooled on the bottom of the inside of the bag when we opened it upon arrival home.<br /><br />OVERALL: This product had a lot of promise but failed to live up to its billing on numerous levels. I would not recommend this product for long car trips.
B006JXSTC8|3|I thought the handle would have a little more leverage then some of the other ratchet straps I had looked at, turns out that when I tightened the strap the handle must have pulled to the side slightly and it bent. It probably would have worked okay had I been a little more careful but I still feel like the gauge of the metal is not thick enough to take the same torque that the strap can.
B000COVJ4K|5|I bought NKG (2397) BKUR6ET spark plugs for my 2000 Jetta 2.0. The plugs previously installed by previous owner were ACDelco which made my car misfire. I installed them with NKG (57041) VWC035 wires. My car now runs smooth. I did not have to gap them. I also paid less than what I would have paid for other brands being offered at the auto part stores I researched. These are the right plugs and wires for this car. Note: You will need a spark plug wire removal  tool to make the job easier and do it correctly. You will understand when you are removing and installing your new wire set. I almost cheaped out and didn't get the tool.
B00O9AZC4G|5|I wanted &#34;girly&#34; colors to match the multi-color pin striping on my new pearly white SUV.  We had to trim the top of the license plate to fit the frame so the bottom year and month stickers, in my State, would show.  No big deal.  The frames are heavy and the colors vibrant.  I'm very pleased with this quality product.

B000CJ05ZE|5|Highly recommended if installing any DEI alarm (non Clifford G5 series).  You can access features (to modify) using this Bitwriter that you cannot with just the plainview switch.  Just by that fact, you should purchase this unit if programming any DEI alarm.  And this unit makes it so much easier to program anyways, rather than counting chirps.<br /><br />I'm just surprised that DEI hasn't come up with an app (and a cable to interface) for your smartphone to change settings in the DEI alarm system.  Weird.  Clifford G4/G5 utilizes Windows to change settings in the alarm system (as well as programming the Smart Windows).  I don't know why DEI would still force their installers to utilizle this handheld.  Being so, it seems this would be such a worthwhile purchase.  You do not need to install the upgrade chip in this unit because it already comes programmed with the latest settings.
B001KVN22G|5|as above spot on

B000CITK8S|5|great
B001VJS2FE|1|I've had this gauge for several years and thought it was accurate, but recently when using it I got pressure readings from 30.5 to 33.0 -- I was getting a different reading every time I used it.  I've had junky discount store gauges that were more consistent (and probably more accurate) than this.  And -- it has new batteries.
B00065ZIJ2|5|good tool.
B00KBJ8X0E|5|Looks great on the wall.
B00B1BCM9O|1|They were the same hinge. The lower hinge bolt pattern is offset from the upper hinge. I had to redrill the bottom hinge.  Not happy. The top and bottom hinges are not identical. But that's what I got.
B008WA7E36|5|Awesome. Works great with R12 and R134A systems. I had my doubts but it all blows cold now.
B008BVVY1O|3|Not what I'd expected. Covers doesn't fit properly and doesn't accommodate car seat bases. Some of the thread came undone during installation without much force.
B0012ARRCQ|5|Quick easy install. Great price.
B000E7D394|4|nice wire for the price...
B000C9DIQC|5|works fine great price
B00RW24U8M|5|Works like expected. Strange instructions on how to set it up, but once you get over the tiny print it's doable.
B00MATVMC4|5|Excellent value!!! Good item for storage!

B000S34NG6|5|very good
B007GFML72|4|Does the job it is intended to do, but is a little pricy. I needed it to mount 2 Harley tires, and have a lot left over.<br />It would be nice if a smaller quantity would be available for the home mechanic. I just don't need 16 ounces of this stuff.
B000I1KJT8|5|How have I gone my whole life without using these? I can get any clamp off within seconds now with these
B000K2KZIU|5|This worked great
B00JA80PEO|5|Easy to hook up to iPhone 6.
B011ERI1NA|5|very good and a bargain to boot

B0036E9VB6|5|EASY TO USE.. WORKS FAST AND VERY COMPACT.. WILL BUY AGAIN
B002XY7P22|5|Good stuff
B007TYKXHK|5|The item worked perfectly, the only drawback was it came with no instructions or hardware.  I've installed one before, so had knowledge of how to install.  Overall, great product for the price.

B000C9CBPQ|5|Great fit
B0126V2EOK|5|As advertised, other vendors would not price match. Extremely solid device
B00G0PJI2K|1|Very poor quality leather couches are beginning to sag within 2 weeks after installation also the swivel type buttons they keep the pouch is closed constantly open during riding which is a complete hassle. You can find better windshield pouch for the money. Look elsewhere
B009XQHTP6|5|Very nice, great price.  Really handy to use.
B00OO1YXOA|5|Excellent product!!
B004JV6OMO|5|Like the quality
B00RW4HFJ6|3|LOOKS REAL NICE JUST NOT A PERFECT FIT! RUBS THE FRONT WINDOWS A BIT

B00ZJJ3SII|5|Fit right on my truck,no drilling,just bolted on.Prompt service
B00K0VMXDQ|5|Great product. Saved me numerous times.
B000BJ6ZCM|4|This appears to be a real nice product at a good price.  It fits my 2015 Ram Crew Cab Big Horn 5'7&#34; bed perfectly.  I would have given it a 5-star rating, except the directions are really bad.  The wording is vague and the illustrations aren't much help.  My advice is to put them aside and check out a Youtube video.  That's what I did and the cussing ceased.
B006XGG7AM|5|fits well, works good.
B00GLLZPGG|5|Nice would recommend them to anyone
B006GUMITE|5|This stuff works!!!
B001GRSDQ4|4|Perfect ft for my Murano
B00EXPHAGA|5|This screams &#34;pull me over&#34; hahaha
B00KR3SK7A|5|The leather cover came out great.. The video was helpful but I have a. 2010 dodge charger so I had to pry the button lid off the a parry knife.. Other then that good deal verses 300 dollars from mopar.
B010D6FVNQ|4|I was having trouble when my ranger was very warm it would die for no reason, then after it cooled for 10 minutes or so it would start back up. Also could pour cool water on fuel pump and it would start back up. This fuel pump has fixed the problem. It was an exact switch out nothing to do other than on bolt and unplug the old one and attach the new one. Would have given it five stars but it is quit a bit louder than original one, but works great.
B0031F743W|2|I thought image lifted off for adhesion to mirror but instead it is a print on clear sticker. Clear sticker is clearly noticeable.
B00DS3QJNI|5|love them
B013XSCHXI|5|***i got this from the company instead of doing the transaction through Amazon that's why it doesn't say verified purchase.<br /><br />I love the sticker, I was going to put it on my vehicle but my husband decided he loved it more and put it on his truck before I got to it lol I love that the flag is behind the words and images, it's exactly what we needed at my house!
B000CO94E2|3|It's the part that I needed but it doesn't stay attached to my shift handle. It's constantly popping off.
B000CPAVCA|5|Great product
B006WQ7WQ6|4|First roof bag ever purchase after reading many reviews. What I liked is that none of my stuff got wet and my stuff was packed for a week in it and it rained maybe 3 days. What I didn't like is the very first day I was zipping it back up after my stuff was in it one of the zipper loop broke so was pretty disappointed in that especially since I'm not strong at all. But overall held up well. Can't compare it to any other bags because as mentioned before this is my first bag ever
B009OQ9Y0I|5|I love my tag that I have on my car.  It matches my personality and my car
B000VB6QZQ|5|Really good quality as expected and a great fit to protect my carpet.
B000YC8MVI|4|as good as it gets
B005BNZ1BE|3|I had to order this one twice because the first time it came I only got the front half. I called Amazon and they quickly sent out a replacement and prepaid packing slip for the first one. Cover works well and does cover my two 30lb tanks. Nice access door on top for turning on/off fuel between trips. Would of liked the color to be more of a dark black with more of a shine to it but that's an opinion.
B00KG13A1E|5|Very high quality- worth the extra money.
B000EQ684W|1|Has disconnected twice now. Didn't match correctly with the original.
B00ZKQ8BJQ|5|Great screwdriver. It should be possible to buy replacement and alternate bits for them for less than a new unit.
B0000AY69V|5|Excellent Product
B00VBN66UI|4|Love it but flow of air isn't what I thought it would be
B00OJDR6GA|4|High quality, beautiful colors (we’ve bought red, navy and black in various car mfg.). You can find these for many different cars.  With keys attached on both ends, it’s long, for me a bit too long.  So I sometimes take the push clip release ring on to the spring release so it doesn't dangle so much.  Other than that our family loves them.
B004QHEFCW|5|Great cover! Three months and so far no issues, or tearing and that is living in the SF area where the wind blows like crazy. Will see how it does through fall and winter. So far a great purchase.
B0124B020K|5|Yes
B00O17VAZM|5|looks great  has not changed color.
B000G76OMA|5|Very useful tool for hard to reach places with a conventional grease gun tip.
B00QWT5WGK|4|Nice!
B00YAWT4EW|5|The picture made it look a little smaller so I wasn't expecting it to be a bit bigger, but thats fine by me. I like it.
B0026FCG9K|5|works great
B002CCLFUI|3|Does NOT screw in well so I just plug it in and let it hang.  It works.
B009OBW5O0|3|ok
B000GKD5NI|4|Love the sunshade I purchased. My only complaint is that I am now receiving deals for sunshades. Seriously!  Does this make sense?
B00AQ29FOY|1|They won't stay on . They were the right size and put on correctly but several brackets broke and rattled around inside the wheel cover . I lost two within the first 20mile drive  and they  must be somewhere out on the highway as I did not hear them come off . I'll probably go back to my old covers which I did not like but at least  they stayed on the car .
B00BSYJDYG|5|looks great
B000COX92K|1|I return clamps and only got credited for one and return to
B000HUCJ1G|5|Exactly what it says it was and worked as well as it needed to.
B000EQS0MA|5|Exact fit and resolved this cars starting issue. Works great at a great price.
B0069RNNPM|5|Perfect fit!
B00X7HS5LY|4|Works good! Shade is very light. It takes a little practice to fold it so it fits in the storage case. This really isn't a problem. I would suggest that the vendor include folding instructions.
B00E7FU4SC|5|Very Nice
B003EU0JFY|1|it didn't work and I return it. they didn't return nothing and didn't hear from them
B001U6DMSK|5|I had to order these for my truck. I love them they fit so well  and  changed the whole inside look ( for the better) I recommend taking the seat out when put on this way it looks so professional.
B000CM0X12|1|Did not work for 2002 Saturn SL
B009TDG936|5|All seems well with Battery. No problems as of now. Thanks
B0087NB0ZQ|5|Works great love it
B007TYARWG|5|I love the tail lamp.  It worked perfect.
B005RF6G4M|5|PERFECT fit!  Great for keeping sun/heat at bay
B001C6Q34S|5|Congratulations, if you bought this and watch a YouTube video you just saved yourself about $60 by doing this yourself instead of the dealer doing it for you.
B000FQ7ING|3|Once again, replacement part. It works, that's all I ask.
B00VN59XDG|5|Worked great and gave me enough room for the new big tires !
B004C443J4|3|Tried them on once and they were a little tight on the top of the foot but they went up in smoke with the truck so not sure if they would have got better.<br />Then they up'd the price so I went with another manufacturer
B01092IEEM|5|I lovet
B0026MCTL8|5|Worked great in old Mercury Sable. Will update if any issues arise.
B000BZXSE4|5|Just installed them easily on my 2010 Civic. I used a youtube video and they work great! My friend is a manager at a mechanic's shop. When I told him the price I bought them for, he said it was cheaper than he could get them wholesale.
B004C35WKE|3|a little too small lettering
B003F0DWJ8|5|Really good smalt
B00W67TI9Y|3|Scratches engine guard..
B00K8VQEF6|5|Love it!! Took a little time to get it on the steering wheel, but it's perfect!
B005DGK39O|5|Good quality. Made in China.
B0050EF2SG|5|This is a great hitch but it arrived damaged and the manufacturer sent me repair parts.It should ship freight not UPS
B0049MILCY|4|This exhaust system is working very good, I like the sound, not any louder than the stock system I had but a nice tone.  My truck is a 2003 Silverado so the the exhaust tail pipe was rusted out, the muffler was rusty in several spots, however the pipe in front of the muffler to the flange was still good, but I replaced it any way since this system provides a exhaust system from the cat back.  For the price of $ 320.00 delivered, I feel good having a new exhaust for a low cost.  Time will tell if it lasts a good while, if I have a good deal.  Everything went on and fit well, looking at it I would think it was put on by a shop if I did not know better.  Hope this helps.
B0002SR4Q8|5|big fan of lisle a lot of guys in our shop use their products and i know even our snap on guy carries a handfull of stuff because of how popular they are among the mechanics. this tool has worked good for me so far open it up and let the spring close it down on the filter and then as soon as you start turing it it digs into the filter and spins it undone. another lisle product that has worked great for me.
B00ANZHG4U|5|Does the job
B006RUJ2D8|5|This product works fantastic.  I used it to remove the sticky residue left on the tailgate of my truck after I removed the dealer sticker.  I just sprayed this on the area as directed, let is set for a few seconds and the glue residue wiped right off my paint. There was no dulling or apparent adverse affects to my paint, just a clean shiny area where the dealer sticker had been.
B0042EALCW|2|This does not fit my 2008 frontier,it's a bit short even when extended right out.
B000CB6D0S|5|Great!
B003LK2GNU|1|Totally NOT what expected! I was looking for the kind that rubs onto the glass from a clear sticker. I don't know what this is...
B00GBLTKWG|4|Sonax works far better than any of the other many products I have tried for removing road grim and brake dust from my alloy wheels.  When used with a suitable &#34;wheel cleaning&#34; brush that has nylon bristles, Sonax removed it all without damage to wheels or tires.  Recommended.
B001F0LW10|5|Someone broke the drivers side mirror on our 1997 Ford Explorer and I thought &#34;junkyard time&#34; but I was very pleasantly surprised to find this super inexpensive on Amazon. Not quite the quality of the factory but all ok with me
B00HTOB0NG|5|Super happy with these!
B00BG3KJGU|4|Its just as good as factory mirror, but far less in price!
B00J2PL6ES|4|These are nice, they aren't as dark as i'd wanted them to be, but they still look good.
B00HSM6G06|5|works great
B000C91E68|4|Fits correctly, but no instructions or gaskets
B00HWCUDME|2|Very loose, I do not recommend.  Does not hold product still.
B00K6BR4LG|5|A+
B00H7DTMK2|4|I purchased two of these batteries after about a week one went bad. I contacted amazon, informed them of the problem they took care of<br /> me with no hassle and have not had any problems sense.
B000HBM84I|5|Works exactly as stated.  Large bottle lasts long time.
B0089LSMSE|5|I like that its a genuine part. I have 150,000 miles on my civic and bought it at 90,000. Not sure if it ever been flushed but I decided to recently give it a go and was happy with the results. I needed three for my car and noticed improvement in my shifting during city driving. Great knowing its specific for my Honda.
B0070NNUQG|5|Awesome product.  I love the color it's the perfect shade and all bulbs worked for my ultra limited.  Shipping through USPS wasn't long at all.  Would definitely buy again.
B00G4S1SBC|4|Nice
B0023TQEFQ|5|Worked like a charm for early 2000's Honda Accord that had 2 different valve sizes.
B00O4Z5XOA|5|Works great in the back of my SUV.  blows up nice and deflats easy.  I would buy again
B002JQ7PU6|5|quick ship great packaging work perfect direct replacment
B001DONZXQ|5|Works as expected.
B000H3Q2FC|5|It did the trick.  It fixed a $150 pair of sunglasses.  Well worth the money.
B000C2UCBS|4|Just as expected. Happy to say still made in America
B000C172WQ|1|Has disconnected twice now. The clip (where it disconnects with the other cable) is cheap and not a strong as the original cable. Didn't match correctly with the original. Wish I hadn't bought this and stayed with OEM.
B000C31KQS|5|thanks
B00480FIMI|3|no brighter than normal
B00JEP2104|4|Arrived quickly, fit like a glove on my 2004 Hybrid Accord, but I must agree with others, I had to supply my own hardware. That's why it only gets 4 stars.
B003YJJHI0|5|YEP
B00RV83UUG|3|The chrome in the light was peeling off and the leds where not all the same brightness
B0006IX7Y2|5|GREAT IDEA.
B000C7XW24|5|fit right in, works great no issues.
B00X04JRMU|5|great product
B009AA2J0U|5|Had a code B0083 on my 2008 Chevy Silverado. Checked the wiring under both driver and passenger seats and everything looked good. I read the reviews for this sensor and ordered two to replace both. I disconnected the battery for 30 min before I started and I found a crack in the drivers side sensor. After replacing both sensors the trouble code cleared itself. Very happy with this product and just as easy as a oil change to do. Saved big bucks and easy fix.
B000E7SY16|4|work good
B002LNUFWC|5|These are great gloves and they are true to size, so far so good u can't go wrong for 15 dollars.
B0040D2TGG|5|Perfect replacement for worn out and broken clips.  Work the same as OEM.
B0085HD6GU|5|Top Quality
B00DD56EL8|2|Not worth the money. This windshield does NOT have a lock, the photo shown is for the larger windshield. For almost 500 you get a windshield that anyone can steal in a couple of minute. Because it takes no tools to remove.
B000NOO798|1|Did work for 1 week only.
B000BRBW0E|5|Super easy to install.  Perfect length.
B004RDNPOY|5|Easy to install and is exactly what I needed for the tailgate of my 2007 Jeep Commander.  My brother and myself installed them in 10 minutes and they appear to be a quality product.
B0076YE4QO|3|Work okay.  Need constant tightening every time you stop the vehicle they should be tightened and it would be nice if the rubber on the bottom of the bases didn't keep falling off when they are not on the vehicle.  I'm always looking for the rubber booties that have fallen off somewhere.
B000C81UU4|1|Very unhappy with unit, it works in that its a resistor and changes resistance with heat however its resistance levels do not match up with Toyota gauges, I reads a lower resistance.  What this means is it will show your engine running hotter than it actually is, I put this in after replacing a head gasket and this stupid thing had me checking everything (water pump, radiator, thermostat) trying to figure out why motor was running hot, at least according to gauge, I had heater or and there was no heat.  Finally bought a unit from Toyota, yes it was almost $30 but it works, so I got something useful for my money unlike this which was just a waste.
B00M06871Q|5|The Techmount is a excellent product.  Easy to install.  I don't give it a second thought about holding my phone.  So easy to use and does a death grip on anything you want to hold.  I have ridden all day and nothing budges.  I would recommend it to anybody.
B004VXE3IC|5|Works perfect
B003AVO41M|3|Worked for a few months and then had to have it replaced. It worked for what I needed but nit recommended for the long haul.
B002MGKN2A|4|Fast delivery and good customer service.  I purchased this to haul my Typhoon 125 Scooter on the back of my motorhome. It is a sturdy and well built.  Please note, it is very hard to load on the back of a motorhome that sits high. My receiver is 26&#34; off the ground.  The 5ft ramp included did not do the job.  I had a 6ft ramp that I painted black and drilled the proper holes to place it where the 5ft ramp went.  I would like to have an even longer ramp.  By using slight power from the scooter we were able to get the scooter up and it fits fine.  I wish it had a wheel block, I am afraid that I might run it off the rack some day.
B00ABZBRTM|5|This is a really nice vest chain!
B00Z9OYK0S|1|Only three of the six light bulbs I ordered worked correctly. Woudent buy.
B00APL7O4Y|1|they broke when I tried to put them on
B00JSCLIWU|5|Perfect fit! Great quality!
B00H36XX6C|4|The NOCO XGrid XGB3L is touted for a tough rubberized casing and element resistant build.  Frankly, I think that claims of resistance to dirt and so on are overblown, if not downright overreaching.  Yes, the rubberized exterior is protective, and currently follows very much in the style of some other \\"rugged\\" electronics such as the [[ASIN:B00SU3XOI4 BRAVEN BRV-HD Wireless Bluetooth Speaker [Water-Resistant][28 Hour Playtime] - Black]].  As with the Braven - which I mention because I own and regularly use it - the marketing on this unit is somewhat contradicted in a safety/warnings insert which here explicitly states that the XGrid shouldn't be exposed to heavily dusty conditions, extreme temperatures, high humidity and so on.  Oh, and the USB port cover thingie really doesn't look to be all that water tight.<br /><br />That said, it does look to be several levels above the usual cheapie charger.<br /><br />This unit is small and light, which is the obvious tradeoff for more limited charging capacity than other chargers in the XGrid product line. I'm good, because I really never felt the need for a battery pack before, already having a simple cigarette lighter-powered one that lives in the glove box.  My expectations are moderate, I suppose. What I am fending with, lately, is a schedule that involves one family member with a cast on the foot needing to be driven to work, and kids with schedules that have me taxiing them starting pre-dawn and ending after dark. Suddenly, a reliable phone charger - one not reliant on my vehicle's battery - that also happens to be a flashlight with strobe/emergency capacity, sounds like a really good idea.<br /><br />And the flashlight *is* very powerful at full beam.  (The charger gets hot at high after a while but low beam is plenty for finding the door lock if you left the porch lights off.)<br /><br />There's no way around saying that the charging power stats and well as the time quoted to recharge this unit in the user guide are overly optimistic.  I think the recharge is taking me about 4 hours from a USB port hub slot rated for large tablets.  And if I then use that fully-juiced-up XGB3L on my Blu Win HD phone, I don't have a lot left for a different phone - not enough to fully charge two, anyways.<br /><br />But again, this is the one with the flashlight, which actually fits along with its' charging cable and my phone into even a tiny handbag.  For me, the final determinant of whether I one day replace it with the same/similar unit will be how long it lasts.verly optimistic.

B00V7UUQYW|5|very good item good price too
B00B0C7UDC|5|Fitment was great, truck stops well
B00KH3MZ9O|4|it worked good
B000HTLQKW|5|Nice
B00771Z27G|5|I wish it came already painted white but it does what it's supposed to
B0000AY3SR|4|It is a good product. it helped to clean the headlights. IT DOES NOT TAKE EVERYRTHING AWAY, BUT IT HELPS
B002VVIC06|5|It's pretty much what I expected. It's plastic, but doesn't feel cheap, or like it would break easily. It mounted right onto my 1&#34; bars, but also included spacers/adapters for 7/8&#34; bars. One of the included rubber spacers fit my grip well enough. I would have liked to use the thicker one, but it was just a little bit too tight to get it to work. The medium size one does the job though. I would have given 5 stars, but it took a little tweaking to get it working well. At first I couldn't really get it tight enough to hold and not let the throttle vibrate back down, and still be loose enough for the throttle to work freely when the lock wasn't engaged. I ended up stretching the little spring a little, so it opens up the locking &#34;ring&#34; more when not engaged. That worked. I've got it just right, so it holds the throttle without issue for miles and miles, but the throttle is still free and operates normally when not locked. I can also manually adjust the throttle when it's &#34;locked&#34; to fine tune my cruise speed, or if I need to quickly decelerate. (Why of why can't people see a motorcycle before pulling out? lol) Overall I'm pleased, and would buy it again. I think it needs a slightly longer spring to work best, but that takes all of 15 seconds to stretch the one included. Hence the 4 stars. ;) Well, Lets give it 4.5 stars. I can't so I'll be nice and round up... lol
B00NT5VCI2|5|Thus is very cute and looks just like the picture. It fits my steering wheel perfectly and is comfortable.
B00W3TMHY8|5|It works for Iran Khodro! in Venezuela calls &#34;Centauro&#34; recomended.!
B008Z8AGGC|5|We used one of these on the deck and installed another one overhead on top of gazebo for shade.  It will let rain through, but I wasn't looking for a waterproof cover.  We just wanted to cut down on the beastly sun that prevented enjoyment of the deck during warm months.  This works great.
B001PWA0IO|1|Nutsert is really difficult to get in. It just spins and comes unthreaded from the nutsert tool. Tried oiling the bearings but it all just locks together. Couldn't install.
B003TQ3JQ4|5|This is all I use in my CVO.
B00EYBHH20|5|Good fit - works well in my Fox DH helmet
B003YJJVB8|4|As described.
B003VWXVN2|5|Good product, easy install
B000O51VJ0|5|Great size, nice and compact ....throws out decent heat for the size
B0130NLX8G|5|I like that it can hold water or drink bottles and even food in the center pocket and use the buckle attachment as a strap to carry it with you on a picnic or lunch or to the beach! Tons of uses and easy to clean.
B00152PWGE|5|Great
B008LUU63W|5|Follow the instructions to the letter and you won't have any problems. The clearance issue [&#34;no part of the generator should touch any part of the transmission&#34;] is at the speedometer gear housing retainer. I had to file some material from the nut to gain the necessary clearance
B00V5BTCYI|5|Product works exactly like you think it would. Only conents of the can is a little on the amall side. Buy two cans minimum to get at least a good 2-3 layers on after the cleaning with raggtop fabric cleaner
B009DJJYII|3|Seal supplied was too large, causing a leak and the need top remove the tank again and replace it. other than that , seems to be working fine at about a quarter of the local parts store pricing.
B004GBAPC2|5|Excellent aftermarket product line. I use Dorman parts whenever I can.
B004MWOMWY|5|Great fit and look, even with sissy bar.
B001U8KNQM|5|Love it
B005ZWM0R4|3|The scan tool 425801 saved me a lot of money. I plugged it into my van and it immediately diagnosed a problem I was having. After going online and searching for the code I found out what the problem was and how easy it was to fix. Doing the diagnosis myself saved me at least $200 in dealership repairs.<br /><br />The one inconvenience is that you have to take your laptop into the car with you to do a diagnosis. Other than that the tool works well.
B0051PJWQW|3|Seems ok.  More of a wet silicone treatment (ie armour all) than a hard sealer.  Will edit if things change.
B00XCCQ020|3|Good idea, but they didn't fit properly. The window would hit it and not close on my car. Ended up returning and getting the kind that attaches outside. The customer service was excellent, authorizing the return quickly.
B00MGN9F0A|4|Very well made product. Just needs a quick disconnect plug to the battery.
B000C5HU7Y|4|Nice product for the price. The switch installed easily and works great.
B007Y88C60|1|I bought it in june of 2014, ran it for3months stored the car until may of 2015 drove it until mid august and alternator is shot!! Yes one year warranty but, now I cant drive car until I purchase another one. The darn  thing wasn't even ran a year and why should it be considered a year when it was stored away!!!!
B00DHQ668E|5|This is the finest one you can buy.  I have them in all of my three cars.  Fit is perfect, in the wkmter you reverse it to keep heat. In.
B00SAR6PBS|1|Worked for two weeks and now needs replacing again...poor quality? poor design?  Not really sure, just know it is broken...
B00KG556O4|5|Good
B00L4GHCYG|4|High Quality Product very nice finish...Id rate 5 but the mounting tabs provided are to short hence the two sided tape...FYI the center tab is long enough to mount the nut backwards by hand...I then took a portable soldering iron and gently melted the tab into the nut and each side flat to grill plastic. Ensuring a stay on fit if tape fails!
B00H6ETIWY|5|These work great and have plenty of adjustment. I have beat them on trees and brush and they have held up great. They give you a good rear view, but you still need a center mounted rearview mirror. They work great for going through tight places because they are tall enough you can see the rear tires, ground, and side of your sxs. I have them on a 2015 Rzr XP1K.
B0045L9GA0|5|it far surpassed my expectations. I am very happy with it..
B00NNGJO4Q|2|The LED's here will work fine as reverse lights, DRL's, or tail lights only. If you put a load resistor on the turn signal circuit to stop hyper-flashing, and turn on the tail lights, the tail light circuit will back-feed to the load resistor and burn the small 1/4 watt resistor in the base of the LED's, that is used to make the LED's dim for the tail light function. There needs to be another blocking diode in the LED assembly on the turn signal circuit to stop the back-feed of the tail light power to the load resistor.<br />I was trying to install these lights in my 2008 Silverado.
B00HQYTUYA|2|Started coming apart as soon as I put it on the seat belt.  I see why they send them in pairs.
B008D33ZF8|5|EXACT FIT
B000ZNM8H0|5|The best faucet so far this is the 3rd on I've purchases the other 2 were plastic. This faucet feels like metal.
B00M6QTO6C|5|fit perfectly with room to spare.
B0039001TI|5|Oil
B00IO9CNY0|5|Excellent brakes
B00BXLPKI2|1|Two months after purchasing this, the pin that works the pull apart fell out.  This was not from excessive use as I have probably only used the pull apart feature 5 times since I bought this.<br />Another problem with this key chain is one end has a pull and swivel opening.  I thought I would like that as I had used it to attach to a ring on my wallet or purse.  However, we have on more than one occasion, pulled the key chain out of a pocket, and in the process that end opened and dropped the key on the ground.  Fortunately we have been able to find it.<br />I have used pull apart key chains for years, but wanted something unique when we bought our Traverse.  Unfortunately, this one was not a good choice and will be thrown in the trash.  I will look for another, more reliable pull apart key chain.
B00CQ81YHW|5|It gets the airflow up jus enough that wind noise is greatly reduced.
B00XDI3XCI|3|I like the style and look. But I previously bought a kit back in December 2014 and by June 2015 the product malfunctioned. Moisture built up in the main housing and discolored the lens. Had to by new kit several weeks ago. A loss of $150.00. Hope this set works for me.
B00V9AZCBM|5|Just the ticket at a good price
B00KLZ65GM|1|super thin material which provides very little wind protection.  I used it on a 50 degree morning while riding my motorcycle to work and my face and neck were extremely cold as the wind sliced right through the cheesecloth-thin material.  I also ordered two but only received one.  For the price it's not worth my hassle to contact the seller but I thought I would pass on the quality and my experience with this.  Wish I could rate in negative stars.
B007Y574JY|3|Ok product.  Doesn't fit perfect for 2013 Kia sorrento.  Shade is about an inch short on the sides even when fully unrolled and stretched.  Not happy about this.  I live in hot and sunny Alabama and just that small gap lets tons of sun heat in the vehicle.  Have owned similar product from different brand for my other car, should have paid a little more and bought that brand.
B00BCRMAR6|3|Having two small children, I don't know why I didn't get car seat covers sooner. I had a chance to receive these at a discount in exchange for my honest review and I'm glad I took the chance.<br /><br />On the plus side, these look great, the green is vibrant, the black is true,i was excited to put these on. Two hours later, I'm in the ac writing my review. For reference, I drive a 2009 Sonata.<br /><br />I started with the back seat and after unbolting the bottom cushion, I got it in, snug, and looking good. Was a slow start but I thought it would only get easier.<br /><br />Back seat top cover just won't work. Since my seats don't completely fold down, but rather split near the outside shoulder area, there's no way for me to get the elastic hooks behind the seat for a secure fit.<br /><br />On to the front seat... Started with the top-level pulled it over and started fishing for the elastic loops. Turns out the Sonata doesn't have a reach through front seat, there's a panel that covers the bottom of the seat so I've just kind of got them tucked in. Same goes for the bottom, between the plastic on the sides and the bottom cover, they just fit poorly.<br /><br />I rated this three stars not because of the incompatibility with my car but the durability and feel of the fabric. I've already put a snag in it with a rough fingernail, pulled off an elastic loop while trying to secure it, and have loose threads on unpacking.<br /><br />Since these don't fit my vehicle at all, rather than looking Tokyo Drift, my car interior looks like 16 year old who thinks they're cool on their weekly allowance.
B00JVHLS3G|1|It fit loosely as if it wasn't sized right. Apparently that was the case because it blew off sometime during the first outing. Consequently we have nothing to return so we are out of luck. Poor design
B003ZWJJC0|5|2002 Corolla S.  Installed easily after watching a youtube video on how to install it (www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6xnQklr0qE) , works great and seems to be of good quality, doesn't feel cheap.  Can't beat the price too.  I see some people are complaining about it's longevity, don't expect to have this car for more than a few more years so if it lasts that long I'd be happy.
B00390X6DQ|5|Looks great install was super easy. Laid out two strips of masking tape on the front and one side to make sure I got it right. Once you put it down it isn't coming off
B00W60I00O|1|Can't figure out how to use it. Maybe if I read the directions more closely, I could figure it out, but I like my stuff to be more user friendly.
B003V57NUQ|5|perfect for jeep
B000ALJYEW|5|I  bought 2 - one for each side mirror. They work beautifully.
B00I8OK7X0|5|perfect
B000PEAMYU|5|Perfect. Exactly what we wanted with quick delivery as well. Thank you
B007X75KKI|2|At full charge, it only lasts an hour. Very disappointing for an OTC tool.
B000CNJBPU|5|Put this on my Honda side by side and it works great in the winter time. Very nice product.
B00UTD795C|5|It fixed my truck what else can I say.  I'd recommend this to anyone that has to replace this axle and seal on there truck.
B0050DBHW2|5|Easy To in stall. My lady likes it. she can move her legs around.
B0009V1WTS|5|Put these on my boat trailer to replace the old safety chains. Love them....they do not drag the pavement and retract neatly when disconected from the tow vehicle.
B002ZRQ4DI|5|Works fine
B00E7FVSZK|5|exactly what I needed
B005O01H30|5|loved it
B00DMYAM4U|4|Nice. Need to be cut out.
B003U91R82|5|This was first time buying a car part online. Mirror came fast and was exactly what I ordered. Took just a little bit of time to install it. Very pleased and it saved me over $200 from what the dealer said it would cost to have them installed it.
B00MA7744G|5|Nice
B0085Y8SPM|5|I had been through three used switches before this one. I have not had any problems out of it and don't expect to have any.
B00MN7TPAY|5|Great Deal fast shipping
B002UC2RSE|5|It was easy to install. Love it.
B00WDSVEE8|5|Prompt delivery and perfect fit.  It does not feel flimsy or cheap and the lenses are dark enough for the Florida sun.
B00OL4MSTC|4|Headlights  are great, a bit disappointed the didn't  come with the side marker bulbs, it was proved to be somewhat hard to find the correct one to fit since the wasn't instructions as the what type of blub needed. Otherwise quite satisfied.
B0023XYMBU|5|Super cute, a little small, but fits perfect n my little mans stroller :)<br />My husband and I loved it, finally something with my baby's name on it &#60;3<br />Delivered earlier than expected, well packed ;)
B00LPX6992|5|Received as promised, packed well.  Easy install.
B00KB4ZL6I|5|Fast and perfect
B00CNEQYF6|5|Worked perfectly.  Took 5 minutes to install.
B00AIJY2ZM|5|work as expected<br />I use those as DRL that were replacement for CREE based no brand lamps that burned out in matter of week or two<br />no, those are not as bright as CREE, but are not hot ether, so I hope they will run for long time without replacement.
B00B27IWGE|4|Just what I was looking for. Nice black finish. Price was too high if you ask me.
B000COBWQU|4|Totally satisfied with these shocks, replaced all 4 with monomax heavy duty monotube shocks, truck rides smooth ,softer.<br />I have a Dodge Ram 3500 4 x 4.
B00DQ8N6LI|4|fsasdasdasdasd
B000CF7CXG|4|Slightly too wide for using it in the battery configs for APC ups.
B013OB0EXO|5|I plan to post some pictures of my lights on the truck, but in the meantime I just wanted to note that I took a shortcut when installing this light: I just used quick connectors to tap the power that was already running to my running lights. This means that I didn't have to install a separate switch for these lights or anything like that: they just come on when my running lights do.<br /><br />Now, I'm sure some people would want to have a separate wiring harness connected to these lights, allowing for a dedicated switch in the cab of your truck or Jeep -- but I just wired 'em up the quick and easy way.<br /><br />Lots of light from these LED lights, no doubt about that!<br /><br />===================<br />I received this light as a free sample, having expressed an interest in the light and indicating that I'd be thoroughly testing it before posting this objective and fair review. Thus far, having powered up these lights, I see nothing wrong with them. So I'm giving the light 5 stars and will revisit this review should things change.
B00KHUQ9NK|4|I am very pleased with the Leather Steering Wheel Cover.  Excellent price and service, will definitely recommend the wheel cover to friends.  Thanks!
B004XATHVQ|5|Super loud when you want it to be, but quiet enough cruising you can take your mom for a ride and she will not complain. louder than my friends muffler delete exhaust.
B002JFQFNA|5|great deal ,and a nice fit......but I don't look like mr. dirty harry...hahahah...but very happy the shades
B0126YHORE|4|The bulbs came quickly via standard mail but were not packaged particularly safe. I was a little concerned that with the unfortunate rough handling some packages receive that these might have been damaged. Thankfully, they seem to have handled the trip well enough, though one wire was a bit askew when the package was open. A simple push of the wire and it was back in place. It was this fairly minor issue that brought me to a rating of 4 stars, so don't hold it too harshly against the manufacturer/vendor.<br /><br />As for the quality of the light, I was very pleased with the overall product. It fit several automotive outlets, though the most common is likely as a replacement for traditional bulbs. Because the bulb is relatively bright it easily took the place in two of my vehicles. As with lights along the LED line, I would expect thousands of hours of use, though there was no real instruction with the bulbs to back that expectation up.  In fact, the lack of any English readable instructions or information was the 2nd reason I rated this buld with 4 stars. I'm sure the vendor will read this review and I would anticipate that they will begin adding at least a small sheet of English instructions with each pack of 2 or more bulbs.<br /><br />After testing the bulbs in two cars I elected to use the bulbs in some electrical work I was doing for my garage. I enjoy woodworking. Making nice bookshelves, especially the lawyer's case, is a favorite product, and for years I've been trying to decide how to add just a touch of light behind the books without overwhelming the person viewing them from the front. I've use rope lights, strings of low-watt LED, and now these 12v types. I was actually very pleased with the color of the light that was illuminating the back of the 2-tier case. With the front slide-up, glass fronts of the case the interior can be very dark; especially when the lawbooks or other items inside are dark. This color light, as well as its intensity, were well suited for the project, and the person who bought the case had good things to say about thee lights as well as a few other extras I had added to the case.<br /><br />Finally, it is appropriate to point out that I received these bulbs without the normal fee in exchange for a &#34;fair and honest&#34; review. I've written the biggest part of my many reviews for products I purchased and don't really change my attitude toward a product because I was asked to review it in exchange for the ability to keep the product. I point this out for two reasons. First, it is good ethics in business (andone reason Amazon typically asks reviewers to make such notice) and it is an appropriate issue when considering my review. Simply put, the price of this product is not enough for me to surrender my natural ethics just so that I can get it &#34;free.&#34; Of course, anyone who might wish to explore this item further or who have questions please don't hesitate to write to me or post a question here.uited for the project, and the person who bought the case had good things to say about thee lights as well as a few other extras I had added to the case.<br /><br />Finally, it is appropriate to point out that I received these bulbs without the normal fee in exchange for a &#34;fair and honest&#34; review.

B00EXGRRJE|5|excelente...
B0039P2FB0|5|I really like this item. Installation was a breeze, did it in the driveway after dark the day it arrived. I used it a lot this summer running topless and doorless. Was a GREAT feeling knowing that no one could get to our stuff, ALSO, the wife was a bit put off buy the price until she was able to secure her purse when she &#34;borrowed&#34; the jeep. I WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO EVERYONE!
B0035GQ4UQ|5|Works as expected could be cheaper
B010C6URQI|1|doesn't work at all.  The inside sides get cold-ish but doesnt cool even the juice boxes we put in there.  I am returning.

B00KQXKG46|5|EXTREMELY BRIGHT LED BAR! its on my canam commander front pushbar. lights up the road just fine. has been through many washes and in the rain and still working great!
B003CE283I|5|This unit makes set up on my 28 ft. trailer a dream, this takes the place of mutable blocks and elemitated instabilaty.
B00GOXMTBK|5|Exactly what I needed.  Thanks.
B005KJ3210|2|Bifocal part is set way to low....
B00DSO95VK|3|I like the way this looks, but am concerned by a statement on the packaging that this product contains lead.
B00HG2UEBA|3|This bumper step is a bit flimsy for a weather tech product.  I've used many of their products over the years and would rate most of them a 5 star.  This one just doesn't live up to my expectations.  It bends and wobbles when I step into the back of my van, not an attribute you want in a bumper step.
B00LJK7S5K|5|Good for removing clips without any damage
B0049HKFIM|5|Great price. Oem  part cant beat it
B00E9E76F0|5|Make cleaning hard to reach spots very simple! Excellent product :)
B000CIT3N0|5|Put on the engine...torqued to specs...no leak!  Yay!  Good price and a great product.
B007TG7HXG|4|Nice product.
B00IASY686|5|Great mount not an upgrade does not have rubber under mount for extra reinforcement but is quiet  and did the job.
B006YDQ60U|5|Just as I expected to be excellent, and at an affordable good price.
B00YBGA8U6|3|Easy Install, could have installed all 3 in less than 30 minutes if all the hardware was included. There was the problem though. Whoever counts the bolts, nuts and washes needs a refresher course in 1-2-3-4. Make sure and count everything before you start the install and make sure you got all the hardware.
B001FC7DUC|5|I had these on my last motorhome and now on my new one. Great product. easy installation.
B008CQRN2M|1|paid  the extra shipment ,did`t get it when promised////
B00062ZNF4|4|It fit perfect and I feel K&N makes the best stuff out there.  Through the years I've probably bought them for a dozen cars and never had a flaw or failure.  I did not notice any performance or fuel economy increase with this one, but it may be the configuration in my vehicle.  The only thing that was disappointing is that you can't see the cool looking filter when you open the hood (no fault of Amazon or K&N, Nissan left no room so Injen stuffed it down under the headlight).<br /><br />I will say that when you have a filter that's so hard to get to, it's nice to have something that lasts so long.
B002E51W06|5|Worked as it should for my Sonic (1.4T, 6sp)
B00JY079PG|5|LOOK GREAT ON MY CAMPER. STUCK TO THE OUTSIDE WALL ABOUT 2 INCHES DOWN FROM AWNING. IT ALLUMINATES THE AWNING AND ISNT GLARING IN OUR EYES.
B00176L9ZG|5|ny daughter loved it
B00CW1D8U4|5|As expected. Fast shipping.

B003PIQ6XO|1|This hitch does NOT fit a sonata 2010 (base model). Once one side is fitted with the scores about half an inch is missing for the other side to reach the holes in the frame (the center of the hitch is too high).

B008OYAFP4|4|Good price and quick delivery, very pleased with purchase.
B002I9VYEM|1|didn't adapt to my bike ,cheep plastic that can get scratched by a tough bug , but sending it back was a breeze
B001EOYIIQ|5|Really great product. Strong for towing!
B00H9Z1BUM|3|Not as bright as in the pictures
B00OC5BIHI|1|Gross fabric, not good material, waste of money
B0043WS968|1|This shoe assembly did not work.  I must have been for a different model of snow blade.  I would not let me blade sit all the way down even without the washers.
B00IHC7S3A|5|worked great
B00BQXJX08|4|ok
B004DRV2Y4|4|Four stars for a good combination of cheap price and adequate functionality. Light quality is somewhat scattered and fragmented, but passable. Not as good as oe but for the price I can't complain. Everything fit and functioned properly. As others have noted, the rubber seals surrounding the unit are poor, but this shouldn't cause any major malfunction.
B00KZJQ2L2|4|I have an Acura MDX with a large windshield.  This is one of the few shades large enough. It is easy to fold and fits in the door pocket . Very handy. I would have given 5 stars if the wire frame was a little heavier. Compared to the one I bought over 10 years ago this doesn't feel as sturdy. Overall very happy and would recommend
B000GVQZ8Y|4|Can't use it does not fit intended space. have to return it
B006T3CLQS|5|looks awesome, easy to use
B00541775Q|5|Great, as expected
B00651CBO6|5|this antenna looks cool and functions great. it looks better than the stock antenna and is very flexible. the antenna will bend almost all the way back at highway speeds.
B0016HQ3IY|5|It is an incredibly right angled, incredibly rubbery fitting that helped me prevent water from coming into to my 2008 saturn aura through the firewall.
B0009V1WS4|4|Cool. Now some jerk off won't steal my hitched things.
B00LLZFIK0|5|With all the terrible reports about little ones being locked in cars and having children myself I felt a big need to get an all-in-one tool to have on hand for emergencies.  After doing a lot of research on escape tools this one seemed to pass with flying colors.  The colors are great and this product is made of good quality materials.  The one thing I really like about the product is that not only can it be put on my key chain but it is easily detachable from my key chain by holding it and firmly pulling away.  These are very small and fit into the palm of your hand.  Overall I would highly recommend them!
B00JK06O4W|5|Installed on a 2012 f 150 ecoboost. Took longer to unpackage it than it did to install on the truck. The truck looks finished now.
B00LBU5OLS|5|Nice cushion I like
B01092I9LA|5|These seat covers were great!
B000K024VS|5|perfect fit
B00UTX7EZC|5|It was a perfect fit, took the old one off and put the new one in with no problems. Great shipping got here fast. I will continue to buy from them in the future.
B000N2VOUK|5|Added a distinct element to the vehicle.<br />Would highly recommend the purchase.
B000E4SQIA|5|Perfect, worked well and ship was super quick. good product and vendor
B00KTIQASY|5|I bought this when it was being fulfilled by Amazon. It was 50$ and I think for price of the product it was quite worth it. Though unless you have an existing master key it may be a hard uphill battle getting these keys working with your car.<br /><br />Our story when we bought our Lexus ES300 2002 was that it only came with a valet key. We couldn't use it to program any of these new KeylessOption keys. The Dealership here wanted us to buy a pair of Lexus branded key for $235 each, to get them programmed to the car we would have not only needed to pay for cutting a programming them ($50 each) we'd also have to have them flash the ECU (car computer) so that it'll accept the new keys. Now $100 isn't bad for re-flashing the computer. In all before tax they wanted something like $735 to get two new master keys and my existing valet key cut and programmed to the car.<br /><br />I decided to try the much cheaper option of doing it myself and save $600. I purchased these keys for 50$ and the dealership was more then willing to only cut them for $25 each. I then purchased the EZP2013 eeprom chip programmer to reflash the immobilizer chip in my car's ECU. [[ASIN:B00V9JJ7CS Signstek EZP2013 USB High Speed Programmer - Support 24 25 26 93 EEPROM Flash SPI Flash Bios win8 32/64bit 3PCS Adapter - with USB Port - Support Windows 2000&iexcl;¢Windows XP&iexcl;¢Win7,WIN8]] then I got a soic8 chip clip [[ASIN:B00V9QNAC4 Signstek SOIC8 SOP8 Flash Chip IC Test Clips Socket Adpter Programmer BIOS/24/25/93]] The scary part of it all is that you need to desolder the 93c56 eeprom chip off of the ECU (something best done with a smd rework station [[ASIN:B00ITMPQS2 Kohree® 110V LED Digital 858D SMD Hot Air Rework Station Solder Blower Heat Gun]] ) I ended up borrowing one instead of buying one. All told I spent about $145.<br /><br />Since I had a working valet key and after finding some articles online about how immobilizer dumps look and work on DENSO immobilizer systems for the Lexus 2002 line of cars I figured I could move the key code that represented my valet key in the eeprom up to a master key position so that I can use the valet key to program the two new master keys (SAVE A BACKUP DUMP of the immo chip first before doing anything keep it safe.. and copy it a few times just in case.. you can always rewrite the dump back to the chip to get back to where you were before). After playing around with the bits I resolder the eeprom chip back on the board using the SMD rework station. I buttoned up the ECU and put everything back into the car and tried it out. The immobilizer system thought my valet key was a master key and the two new keys were cake to program in. (following the programming instruction given on the card that comes with the keys.)<br /><br />Programming the remote fob portion of the keys were a little trickier ( note the places where it says TWICE and ONCE... that'll save you some time...) but it worked like a charm too.<br /><br />In all this is my second purchase from KeylessOption and I'm very happy with it.line of cars I figured I could move the key code that represented my valet key in the eeprom up to a master key position so that I can use the valet key to program the two new master keys (SAVE A BACKUP DUMP of the immo chip first before doing anything keep it safe.. and copy it a few times just in case.. you can always rewrite the dump back to the chip to get back to where you were before).

B001LWN5SK|4|Used on a 2013 Jeep Sahara Unlimited 4 door (JKU).<br /><br />I would have much preferred one of those light weight materials that reflect sunlight, but they cost $300-$500 dollars for a custom fit product.  And to be fair, the fit of this cover was almost &#34;custom&#34; with the exception of a little bagginess around the rear mounted spare tire which if you've got oversized sneakers on your, Jeep would be a good thing.  I have the doors off my JKU and have aftermarket mirrors attached to the windshield frame that stick out from the vehicle.  The cover still fits nicely, covering the body down over the running boards.  You would not consider this cover to be lightweight which is both good and bad.  The good is that the heavy material will stay put on your car.  The bad is that when folded up, the cover is pretty darn big which is a consideration when you're lugging it around with the car.  Oh, and the bag it comes pre-packed in?  Forget it...you'll never take the time and effort to get it refolded back into it.  I use a nylon bag that came with queen sized air mattress.  A large laundry bag will work also or even a heavy duty garbage bag. But certainly not the one Rampage supplies.  Use it for something else...it is a nice bag.<br /><br />The material is light grey colored non-woven polypropylene with a small waffle pattern embossed into the top layer.  It's a pretty commonly used material for inexpensive covers like this one and while not waterproof, it is water resistant, i.e., a heavy rain will soak it but a light rain or overnight dew will not.  If you take the cover off while it is still damp and fold it up, it will eventually get a unpleasant smell so leave it unfolded until it dries.  Over the years I've owned several car covers made of this same material and they do not hold up long term to the effects of sunlight which degrades the material.  First the material will begin to flake and then one day it will just rip while putting it on or taking it off.  Nature of the beast I suppose.  I've had covers made of this material rip at the sewn seams which is indicative of poor quality thread.  Time will tell with this one.<br /><br />Bottom line---for not much more than a generic cover, Rampage gives you a custom fitting cover for your Jeep.  The fit is quite good and the included cable and lock is nice if you live in California where the surfer dudes regularly steal car covers---but they usually go after the expensive ones.  The nature of polypro's inability to stand up to the effects of ultra violet light is noted, but all covers except those made from Dacron sail cloth suffer from this to one degree or another.  It's a bit bulky when folded which may or may not be a factor.  Amazon Prime's shipping was its usual top quality.  I paid an extra $5 and got next day delivery!  Rampage provides a one year warranty which probably is not long enough to service the cover's polypropylene fabric and it's tendency to degrade in sunlight.  If I get 3 years out of the cover, I'm satisfied.  As noted, the storage bag is best used to store other items, not the cover itself.<br /><br />A solid  **** starsture of the beast I suppose.

B002EOVDII|1|Did not last long.
B008NAA6P8|5|Very versatile piece of equipment....  I use it daily to hold bike while in storage, then mount it to trailer when traveling.  Keeps electra glide upright and secure.
B00029WYDU|5|Good cleaner . Helps get all the dust and old oil out.
B00EC2CG9U|4|They should be named &#34;micro bungee&#34; -- they are much smaller than I envisioned them
B000AL8VD2|5|Will have to see how well it works over time but so far so good.
B005GDZPD8|5|Met and exceeded expectations. Leveled and the quality of the product is superior. Installation is a two man task. Unless you do not have any rusting or your a pro. Will be putting bigger tires on my 18&#34; rock star 2 wheels soon. 2012 Chevy Silverado 1500 crew cab z71 4wd.
B00FVU3W4U|3|Seat is very comfortable but does not easily stay in place
B00CEX45O8|5|great product for a great price! Came in great condition and look great on my Mustang GT!
B0067EZIE6|4|works great, could be a little larger.
B002TPRNFE|5|Quick and easy cleaning inside and out. It really helps stretch the time between carwashes.
B00CMZ9AM0|5|The brakes fit perfect,theywork good.Thanks
B004BTKVAA|1|they either were the wrong one's or they were to cheap to perform  properly. the car ran worst once they were installed.
B007V2EDCG|4|This is the real deal; a solid sun shade, fit to my windshield. I have used the flimsy roll up kind before, and they always warp and eventually the corners are no longer blocking the sun. Get this if you value quality and purpose over cheap heat shields that do not last.<br /><br />- I have purchased 3 of the covercraft series heat shields for 3 different vehicles now. The first two were Mazdas and fit immaculately, the third for my Toyota corolla and it has a 1/2&#34; gap on ether side when centered. The shade still works but bothers my OCD when I see that gap. Minus one star.
B00KWJVL02|5|Get the directions from the company, the YouTube video didn't work for me; the supplier was very helpful in getting this to work.  Recommended.
B000C2WI7O|5|Perfectly fit my 2007 Subaru Forester 2.5X.  It is a little wider than the original, but it fits just fine.
B00H2WXWYA|4|Cute and sparkly. Already had 3-4 stones fall out but luckily they give you extras. Wish there were more rhinestones overall, but it is exactly as pictured.
B007IGGGR0|5|Exactly what it says it was and worked as well as it needed to.
B005FEGP7I|1|Dead on arrival, and the software disc had paint or something on it so it would not read.  Furthermore I use it with a software sisc for a very simmaler one that reconised it correctly but it would not connect.
B000YCAN1A|5|I love them
B001PNIKJO|5|Great
B00192JGY4|5|Good

B00AEEGV96|2|Gas cap does not fit a 99 BMW 540I - product was deliver in a timely manner and was brand new - will update about the return process
B00ER1KPJ4|5|Relatively easy to install.  Hardest part was pulling trim piece out of back of car.  Works fine.
B001CEG90I|5|Work well
B000GKTYNI|5|It's antifreeze. Not much to say.
B009QLBDSW|5|Quick and good
B00E9G2B5S|5|good price fast service worked as advertised
B004A6JA2O|5|Work well
B00V65PWQA|3|Only used it once sofar. Seems chincy. Not sumthing i would purchase to use alot
B00PKJQXFM|3|Even though this is sold as an XL windshield cover, it is barely wide enough for the magnets to touch the metal at the sides of my 1997 Dodge van windshield, and there is no way that the sewn in pockets will tuck into the windows to hold the cover in place.  I plan to sew some nylon twine to the bottom of each pocket and tie it to the side mirrors.  That will keep it from blowing away, at least.
B00LE0B6EE|5|Excellent product!!
B001G8AIMU|5|simple charger that I use for substitute power wheels batteries, works fine.
B0068G289G|5|I wanted some goggles that were light weight and could easily fit in my vest when I wasn't wearing them.  They perform well at high speeds with minimal air bleed when riding behind a windscreen.  They do tend to start to fog when stopped at a long light, but not enough to keep me from buying a second pair.
B00H7MV25Q|1|couldn't latch the hooks to stay - always came off
B00DSD5I4E|4|Great Quality but extremely hard to put on
B00FBKUF6I|1|i like the way they look but they dont last , not even a year and now i have to replace one of them is sad because the same thing happened to my brother not even six months , i bought mine on december 2014 the damaged one stop working like 2 or 3 months ago been driving with high light all the time i just got pull over guess i have to buy another brand
B00GWESV2W|5|Handle arrived on time. Fit perfectly on truck. Looks good
B00MOR4D5U|5|Great product, hope it last.
B006NVYOBG|4|very good
B000CCIDAA|5|Works exactly as it is supposed to.
B003NBK1RU|5|This device worked great! I sprayed the outside and inside with a lubricant. It is easy to remove when needed.
B0057HAAII|4|Great battery especially for the price.
B004OXJ56O|4|We live in Mx out on a dirt road.  The petronics was purchased to replace an older distributor  on a 1972 VW Safari.  It works like a champ. Two thumbs up.
B00FDQPCR2|5|This LED light seems to be a sturdy product and is almost perfect. The light and solar panel are of sturdy construction and, while light, feel much more solid than I expected. Installation was as simple as taking the bracket off the light, screwing it in with two of the six included screws and then putting the light back on the mount. The cord to the solar panel is about 10 feet or so, which is generally ample room to get the panel to where it needs. The solar panel has a ball socket so that you can turn it and twist it in almost any way you want. Also, this light is bright! I've included before and after photos in this review. I live out in farmland and it gets very dark -- it can be hard to see right in front of you. This light does it's job.<br /><br />While you can bend the solar panel back, causing it to face forward or up while mounted on a wall, you can't adjust it to move forward -- which I really needed. For where I had to mount it compared to where the sun is, having the ability to swivel both up and down, as well as left and right would have been helpful. Sadly, I can only go down, left and right. While this is hard to explain in writing, it can't perfectly fit my needs without having a 30 foot cord that I could run to the other side of the house. Even so, I have adjusted the knobs so that it's only on for ~5 seconds during movement and only at night, so it should have enough to stay powered.<br /><br />Overall, I'm quite happy.
B005WG88KQ|2|Flimsy and slow.  I'm still questing for a quality pump.
B00IO98X4E|5|Great Brakes! Great package deal! Lotsa bang for the buck. These seem to be of a much higher quality than the price would suggest. They arrived at my door in around 2 or 3 days, and were on the truck the same day. And the shipping was free as well!. Months later they are braking as smooth as day one.. The drilled/slotted rotors are really nicely machined, and seem to be of a high quality metallurgy too.. They never seem to be too oxidized after sitting for a while... I think they'll last a lot longer than the way more expensive ones I usually buy at my local parts stores.. Highly recommended!
B00IZ8769C|2|I was hoping for something more louder is not great but is not very bad, anyway thank you.
B00CJD2TWI|1|I bought these to replace OEM injectors with 170,000 miles of use.  After installing the AUS MP-56117 injectors my fuel MPG dropped to 17mpg.  I was constantly getting a reading of 3mpg on acceleration.  I replaced several sensors in hopes of improving my gas mileage.  After several weeks it was recommended that I clean the OEM injectors instead of replacing with a remanufactured AUS injector.  I used Sea Foam to clean the OEM injectors and had them reinstalled.  Instantly cars MPG increased to 28mpg on average.  Cars mpg now rarely drops below 8mpg on acceleration.  I have also confirmed this reading with an OBDII device and application that measures fuel consumption.  If you look closely at the photo the OEM injector has twelve (12) fine holes where the AUS injectors only have four (4).  These &#34;remanufactured&#34; injectors are inferior and not OEM replacements.
B000CHIK7G|5|Fit my 2008 F150 like the original part I replaced it with.
B00P1LVCQE|5|It works...I have literally seen cars back off me...enough said.
B0066RZO7A|5|Had to trim it a little bit to fit. But better to be a little too long then a little too short. Other than that it fit perfectly.
B00P2W1IN4|5|Perfect fit had more included than what was needed
B000OAXP6M|5|Arrived next day, packaging perfect, perfect fit and finish, looked even better after using chrome polish.
B00N59JGOO|5|Great deal great quality I even muffed one up laying it but as I carded it it layed flat all on its own!
B0002SR4Q8|4|Great Idea, but this will not fit in between the filter and engine on my 2007 new body style Silverado 1500 with a 5.3L engine.
B00GN2YDWA|5|It worked very well on my car.
B0053HPOBU|4|It's a simple mechanism so not alot to say. I bought this one to use due to the thread size being different on the threaded barbs.
B00IABCJS2|5|Easy fix to a broken damper. Would be nice if the tabs were stronger.
B0055DQRFE|5|worked great AND fast delivery
B00AECE03W|5|Great part, work good
B00VX9VH9U|5|This bag works great on my Yamaha XT 225 so it should fit other dual sport bikes as well.  It's a large bag but it doesn't get in the way.  I use it to carry my lunch to work and there is plenty of room for a lunch and a small jacket.  The zippers are strong and never get stuck.
B009G9RW4S|5|The Dodge radiator hose work the best with the spring clamps already held in place, and internal springs to keep hoses from collapsing.
B000F3MFKU|5|Just the ticket. Everyone beside the boat dealers did not have in stock. Right plugs to my door and saved money.
B0016LG0CY|5|I needed a new lighter adapter for my 12V air compressor since I accidently broke the original adapter.  I had to replace the 2A fuse that was included with this adapter with a 15A fuse.  Fortunately they were of the same type &#34;SFE20&#34; or &#34;3AG&#34;.<br />I used crimped butt splices to make the connection to the compressor wiring.
B0002JMYKS|4|does the job
B007Y55EZK|5|fits great. as other have mentioned it is a bit cumbersome but blame honda for having such a large windshield.
B00GQ2TC14|5|perfection
B001LNC5N0|5|fits spot on
B0002STTSY|2|Doesn't work very well with blue insulated blade terminals had to put them in the red crimping slot
B000WK0LOS|5|A must have for any bike owner
B00DZY439M|3|good product fair price
B0036QZ8VQ|5|I was absolutely impressed with these.  You CAN NOT beat the quality for the price.  I put my bike up on both stands every day and it is simple to do by myself. Easy to put together, and they look fantastic. I can't say enough good things about them!<br /><br />Currently using on my 2005 YZF-R6
B00RCA2DGU|3|purchased this 4 light set, 1 of the 4 does not work.  had to alter my original equipment to install. contacted seller two days ago about problem, they still have not contacted me.  now my truck has to be illegally operated due to the fact that I had to modify it to get the lights to work, except  of course for the one light that does not work at all.  no feedback from amazon or the supplier is unacceptable.
B000JZYV2Y|5|Fast shipping and I am happy with the Resonator Assembly Thank's LEW
B00C7897TI|5|The rubber on my oem SV650SF lever was transmitting to my shoes, leaving black stains on all my left shoes. This lever fit every bit as well as the oem lever, with very smooth function.
B00GR2WE9U|5|Retro, Vintage...Great Color!
B00B9EW0RC|5|Great product
B008GTOHBA|4|I just installed this cover on my 2007 Toyota Tacoma. The kit is the same for 2005-2015 Tacoma's. I don't have a long term review to post, only my initial impressions.<br /><br />The cover is well built and was relatively easy to install. It does require a helper due to it's size. The cover utilizes the Tacoma's OE bed slide rail channels for mounting the cover's side rails. This unfortunately requires the removal of the OE adjustable tie down cleats which was a huge disappointment, but all of the retractable bed covers I looked at had the same requirement. I installed additional tie down hooks in the bed floor several years ago, as well as on the inside of the tailgate, so these will have to suffice. The OE slide rail under the truck's rear window had to be completely removed. The mounting holes are concealed by the Retrax drum assembly.<br /><br />The presence of the Retrax drum and side rails did slightly reduce the overall bed cargo capacity, but the benefits of the cover outweighs this in my opinion. I am glad now that my truck has the 6' long bed.<br /><br />The cover slides easily and locks in any position, but I found the locking latch very stiff and difficult to operate. An adjustment of the latch assembly remedied this. I had to figure this out on my own...it should've been included with the installation instructions.<br /><br />While this retractable cover is the most expensive on the market, I am glad I chose quality over price. One recommendation on the installation; drill out your drum's water drain holes BEFORE installing the drum assembly, contrary to the installation instructions which tell you to do it dead last. I could not get to my existing drain holes to widen them after bolting everything in place. I had to crawl under the truck and drill them out from underneath. It would have been much easier to do it before bolting down the cover. The only other negative I can think of is the ease of stealing the entire cover if you choose to leave it openwhen there is no need for a cover. It is bolted down with only four bolts. I don't plan on leaving the cover closed all the time, so I will have to think of a way of making less easy to steal.
B00TRR09DA|5|Item was exactly as described. Shipping was quicker than expected.  The price was the best I could find for this item.
B000B917PW|3|the cap fits poorly (I replaced it with an antifreeze bottle cap) and the spout is a bit awkward (I guess the downward position is justified if your vehicle takes ~5L of fluid per job...), but it works.
B000W0MOKC|5|worked much better than last lock I had all ready and quick locking and positive lock
B0008FUH46|3|Hard to fit to my trailer tounge is two wide so the bar has to sit on there cantered to function.
B000O023KG|5|EXACT FIT
B0097SVYY2|5|Fits like a glove in my truck thanks
B008032QKG|5|I've had issues with auto parts ordering online but I got lucky on this purchase. It came in good condition and fit perfectly on a 1997 Corolla.
B000XEGEWG|5|Great price for 12 pack of microfiber cloths. I use it to wipe my granite counter tops down, my stainless steel appliances, windows, mirrors, bathrooms, glasses, TV, iphone, my car, etc...There are countless uses for this cloth and the best part is that it's non-scratching and lint-free so you can use it for all kinds of surfaces. I keep a few in my kitchen, bathrooms and garage for easy access. I won't go back to regular cleaning cloths or paper towels again. Definitely save some trees and buy these for your daily cleaning use.
B00BKY6E4Q|5|works fine great price
B006HI7Z6Q|5|Easier and cleanerstarts. Smoother low speeds.
B009197TBY|1|Absolute junk. I had such high expectations  All I wanted was to air up a bicycle tire.  This think broke during the 1st tire attempt. Literally lasted about 45 seconds.  Motor trend should be ashamed to have there name assoc with it
B000C31KAO|5|Great and fast transaction i would buy again
B0091KCG0W|5|work great!i love it.
B00BG90AZO|5|they look great on the truck.
B000EA5WLS|3|Didn't fill crack as expected
B00V82IZ42|4|You must remove the transponder chip from your original fob case and place it in the new case. This is not indicated anywhere in the description nor does the key case come with instructions.
B00TDCV6DG|5|These work perfectly in our travel trailer. We like them because they don't get hot like the others.
B0007TV6M0|5|It works really well for polish a car very quickly.
B00BQYCIVI|5|Does and amazing job, I have a black Mitsubishi Lancer Ralliart, it leaves the car spotless only problem is you will need 2 towel's. I only have one and on the first drying attempt, I got half the car done and realized I would need to buy another one to finish the car. But the towel is amazing!!!!
B00J9TYTPA|5|great even though the steelers are awful
B00JVHLS3G|5|Still on after a year being installed. You'd be hard pressed to see the difference with the genuine one. Happy buyer I am
B00Z7KIZPA|5|This arrived promptly and is as described. It fits fine between my seats in my Toyota Camry and took only minutes to install.  It keeps my purse within reach when I have someone in the passenger seat and the pocket holds papers I need to keep in my car within reach.  I love it!
B00WDSVEE8|5|Great glasses, great buy!!
B000637TNM|5|GREAT PRICE!

B0053O9FQS|5|Good stuff.  I have used it on shifter assemblies, wheel bearings, bicycle stuff, and and even roller bearings in an old reel mower.  Haven't had a problem yet.
B000QIUY5W|5|Factory just what I needed.
B0130NLX8G|4|It's quite a bit smaller than I expected. It's nice, well built and cute. I was offered the product at a discounted rate in exchange for my unbiased review.

B00FDQPCR2|5|Great product, especially considering the price.<br /><br />Puts off a great amount of light.<br /><br />Had an issue, quite possibly my fault, I emailed them and they took care of it.
B00AQ29FOY|3|Looks good for the price.
B0006FK7YS|5|This mop is everything I hoped it would be! I have hardwood throughout my entire house, and this mop has made what was once a daunting chore of sweeping and mopping my floors a breeze! I use the dust mop head, and it literally collects ALL pet hair, and other small, annoying debris from the floor. Mopping has also never been easier, and I only use the scrubber mop head, and water. It leaves my floors absolutely beautiful, and so shiny. I would highly recommend this mop for any and everyone!
B003UMHMY2|5|It's a spark plug.
B00YBHL8M2|5|Great product!
B00J8FFH7Y|5|Easy to install, came on time, don't love the white light, but works great. Previous was incandescent therefore yellow.  I was told this light may be irritating the oncoming drivers.  LED should last a long time so  ce la vie
B002XM5G70|5|Very quite and seems to have more pressure then the original pump. Would recommend it to anyone interested in changing out their pump.
B000JYMD9S|1|I hate it! I kept overheating with it. replaced it with a new oem pump, and problem solved!
B00P2K08J6|5|I love this...it worked great; lights up when you apply the brakes.<br />I would and purchase Bully products again...will make a good gift; there are other makes and models too.<br />Thanks.<br />Patty, Columbus, OH
B0012WW3LY|5|Superb units are a perfect fit and even provide fully .adequate support in frigid weather, a problem sometimes with such replacements.
B008QBZZGO|5|Fabulous helmet. Will buy another for my passengers
B0052SF0LO|1|Received a unit that wouldn't recharge.  Illumination with factory charged batteries (as received upon delivery) was modest and motion sensor was inconsistent.  Once factory charge was depleted the unit was unusable and not worth the hassle of returning.
B003JBR1SG|4|Works well
B000MNN4WQ|5|I like these tiedowns
B00E9HWRK6|5|very heavy duty, easy to cut and fit,

B002805STS|5|Great to use on swangers....
B00U7XT1C8|4|This was for my husband who drives tractor trailer over the road.  It really helps him to see much better.  It is a big help for him.  He really likes it.
B009B42JUU|5|As much as I don't care for moog the ball joint is twice the size of the one on the ones I replaced, I believe they were atx or something along those lines

B008X02KT8|1|The packaging was s***ty and to top it off they were the wrong size
B00P2DB1EO|1|Not bright not in any way similar to HID or xenon
B00JIHC36K|1|The pair worked for the first couple days then one kept turning off for no reason. I finally got it to work but now its only half as bright as the other one. Not worth the money at all. Just buy regular bulbs
B001GMX9R2|5|Very easy to install. works fine.
B000K05L86|5|I've been using this filter for years and it keeps my injectors from getting impurities in them
B002ZRQ4DI|5|Not expensive and easy to install.
B00IPS4APU|5|I wasn't happy with the service I was getting from the local glass shops, so I decided to fix it myself using this kit.  Many glass shops are in a hurry to get your money, so they don't allow the resin enough time to penetrate.  I took my time, followed the directions, and watched 2 nickle size stars disappear from my windshield.  The only issue I had was trying to get enough sunlight to cure the resin, which took a little longer than expected.  People think you need to large, fancy tool to force resin into a crack.  You only need enough contact to make a seal on the glass, otherwise you will flex the glass making the crack tighter or expand it.  This tool is substantial enough to do the job.  Give it time and follow the instructions EXACTLY.  Pay close attention to steps 4 and 5.  I used a hair dryer inside the windshield on LOW to help the resin spread.  Make the repair out of the sunlight and then move it into the sunlight to cure.  There's several YouTube videos of people making successful repairs with this kit.  It's best to make the repair as soon as possible after the break.  Once it gets dirty, it's very difficult to fix.

B00NR7UQ4I|5|The Tweety Bird decals love great on my back windows of the Kia Soul.  I love Tweety Bird.
B00O7W9HV0|5|My dealer purchased these for me and at first I was a little bummed because I thought I was getting the factory mats.  After looking at the factory mats more closely I realize the WeatherTech mats are far superior.  They cover the floor completely with a good fit and don't have gaps.  I especially like the extra coverage these mats have for the left foot rest which can get especially sloppy in the winter on other vehicles if you like to rest your foot there.  The mats are held in place with the factory retaining posts so they can't move around - not that they could because the fit is perfect.  I would strong consider the WeatherTech mats for any new vehicles I purchase.<br /><br />Product Notes:  Be aware that you are only getting the front mats with this package.  The rear mats come with a different part number.
B009SLF4WG|5|This was great considering that the company Weathertech still doesn't have these for the trunk of my car yet, perfect price too
B00NF1R1AS|1|DON&#34;T BUY  This product does not fit very well!  You will have to modify it to make it fit. The product is also a brittle plastic, you will most likely break it while fitting it as I did. It will most likely fail with the first rock that hits it.
B002R8HN1W|5|The  ausie sheepskin sideless seat cover fitted well to my wife 2015 Lexus IS 250.It took few minutes to install. The only area that I have a challenge was for two short straps on the top of  the cover  furnished to secure the head restrain. The length of the straps could not be adjusted, something the manufacturer should take into consideration. Fortunately my wife didn't mine to have the head restrainer covered as it does not get the wear and tear as the lower part and the side of the leather seat.  I removed the head restrainer,  furnished two holes in the sheepskin cover to allow the replacement of the head restrainer back to the seat. Regarding the sheepskin odor, didn't bother me as did my wife, so we are letting the cover air for a week or two before we putting it back to the seat.
B000AYDXJQ|4|A little larger than I was expecting and flow is more than I wanted.  I guess I really wanted a &#34;precision&#34; oiler, but this is fine for other tasks.  I would have given this 5 stars, but I needed to use teflon tape to keep oil from leaking between the can and the spout
B001G6QCJK|4|2002 BMW 325ci (2 door coupe) manual transmission (FTW).<br /> Fits but with a different bulb than what is original equipment.<br /> 4 stars b/c Amazon says it's correct, (and it does fit) but my car came with the P21W type bulb, so I had to buy bulbs too.<br />PROs.<br />-newer design (i guess) and maybe a better plastic or abs..don't know really but it's black and fits<br />-fits into the p21w (clear) lens and also the plug that goes into the back<br />-works like the other side<br />-uses 1154 bulbs (simple, single pole at the bottom and two side pins allowing them to install in either direction 180 degrees).<br />- 1154 bulbs are found everywhere and very inexpensive (i needed amber colored, and Wagners are the best colored glass, won't flake off)<br />- 1154 side posts are identical on each side<br />CONs<br />-isn't the same as what came with my car<br />-now one side is black, and the other side is white<br />-i should buy another one, or return this and buy the correct version..<br />.<br />back to a PRO: .because the correct version uses the p21w bulbs, which can only be inserted one direction, and are more expensive, and also not even available in my local shop (when i went to get them, they only had 1 place for them, and they were out of stock..while the 1154 had several rows in both white and amber, from different manufacturers...<br />/<br />final verdict = happy on face, due to it fitting the lens and plug, and using a more 'basic' bulb that has been around since (guessing) wwII and found everywhere (even grocery stores).<br />advice : slap some vasoline (or bulb-grease) on the bulb to keep it from corroding, and sealing out moisture. also helps remove them years later..they never get stuck... i do this to all my light bulbs and many electrical connections..
B00W4B4X10|5|works great so far
B005K79I60|5|Perfect
B001G54LRQ|5|Awesome cover for Price
B004GZKW80|5|Loved this product, fit great on my Tundra. Only had one problem , no mounting instructions for this item when it came so it took a while to put on. Plus it was late getting to me per the shipping date by a few days. Other than that great item.
B00KJ1E2DQ|5|Great product, great price, definitely much nicer than anything jeep offered, I would suggest this product to anyone looking for a solid keychain with modern style.
B0027I88VQ|5|Great little fuel pump. Use it to get fuel to my kicker motor. (6hp Outboard).
B002WBF8QQ|5|Excellent air filter: I prefer these over the OEM filters.
B00SLKQQKY|4|These look pretty good on my truck. However the the bolts that it comes with are silver and really stands out against the black. Nothing a little black paint can't fix though.
B006B80KKA|5|I always use K&N filters to all of my cars for many years, they are long lasting, gas saving, horsepower increasing filters. Amazon.com is my favorite place to shop, fast shipping, hassle free return or exchange, and in addition to all of this, great prices!
B00O5UFNEO|5|Way better than the &#34;custom made&#34; one I used previously. Covers my entire BMW R1100R including top case, panniers and windshield. Heavy duty, multiple layered and waterproofed seams. Built to last and at a great price.
B000G78P8G|5|Great galvanized metal pan for general shop work.
B006QXX1FG|5|Bought these for the dome and map lights of my Subarus. Had to spread the connectors a little to get them to fit, but there is still enough room to get them out and the connectors hold them steady. Lights are very bright and have good spread so it covers a good area.
B00JPVJ0KG|5|Wanted them for the speed

B00267SQVU|4|I bought one of these some years ago, and gave it a bad review when it soon stopped working.Koolatron sent me a new motor and cord-it turned out that just the cord was defective- and it has worked fine ever since.I wouldn't be without it for travel.Definitely get the adapter to allow plug in use in your hotel room.
B00PBEN5PW|2|Covers do not stay on. Loved the look but if you have low seats and unable to hook them like me they are useless.

B00H4FDIOO|1|Thought it was going to be like ozium..its more like perfume.
B00CUOTAA0|1|3000 miles after installing the chain the RH chain tensioner failed causing the chain to jump time resulting in engine removal and chain replacement.  Do not cheat yourself on quality get the Cloyes brand it is the factory part inside of the box.  This kit shows a single silver ring for the tensioners but it requires two (one for each tensioner) and you get two in the Cloyes set.  It was not my choice to buy this one as it was the customers but I would not recommend this chain set.
B00D3298A0|5|The mats are great quality and a lot more affordable than others. I have a Nissan Versa 2009 and it fit perfectly! You can always cut the edges if it's too big for your car.
B001LHVOVK|5|Very Basic Scanner that I have had for quite sometime now.<br /><br />No bells and whistles. Just reads and clears codes. Usually I scan the car to get the code and then look it up online to get an explanation.<br /><br />It does have issues with Diesel trucks in particular. It doesnt read the codes on Chevy/GM Diesel trucks and Ford Based Diesels.
B0010GG7YG|5|I own a 2011 GMC Sierra and my driver side power window controls began to fail to the point where I could not put any passenger side windows down and nearly couldn't get any driver wide windows up. The truck is still under a bumper to bumper warranty so initially I figured I'd have the dealer take care of whatever the issue was. When I brought it in (after calling first) they told me it would be several hours before they could even look at it; and since their electronic technician wasn't in they may not even be able determine what the issue was. Unacceptable.<br /><br />I figured I'd handle the repair myself and after a little bit of diagnostic work, making sure it wasn't a fuse or the motor I decided to buy this switch and give it a shot. I looked up some instructions on how to replace the switch and when it came in; went outside and swapped it out in less than 5 minutes. And it has been working great ever since.
B000OO4PWG|1|sent wrong size the adapter sent had 5mm threads not 6mm as stated in the listing.
B007GALVKA|5|Was a great gift for my cherry loving aunt. Simple instructions were included for an awesome price.

B001NAP2Q8|5|Noticeable difference in power and sound. Easy to install and looks good.
B002MWNT84|5|Covers the GPS mount on the Motorcycle works as it should
B007ZCQD9S|5|I have rated this a 5 star product for its set-up, appears well built and has been reliable. If i was rating support/install instructions I would rate it a ZERO. The installation sheet sucks, it is written in a country that doesnt translate to English as seamless as some. The instructions will be you installed but they have you install,and remove, re-install certain parts. Frustrating and a time waster with their install directions, the word here is PATIENCE will PAY OFF. Once you get the unit installed it operates flawlessly, the switch is lame looking generic appearing but it serves its purpose. The set/res/acc/coast functions are easy to memorize. If you drive or appreciate the reliability of holding speeds dont hesitate, buy this product!
B007CN9IJW|4|I have it adjusted at one point on the seatbelt and I leave it that way, so when I get back in the car I don't have to readjust it. The lap belt slides up a bit but at least the shoulder belt stays away from my neck, and that's why I've been wearing my seatbelt all the time now.
B009VI58CM|5|Great product, save my client over $500 in repair, customer is happy and I'm happy, shipping took a week, even though it was prime, but don't really care that much, the seal solve the problem and ford that sell the seal, they want you to buy the injector at $500 a piece, no thanks ford
B009LAV4YG|5|Works great!
B00C5RBRA8|5|Well made, all the fittings, adapter you need. Love it. Must buy for rv owners. Comes with EVERYTHING you need instead of buying pieces to make it all fit. Excellent kit.

B00L4TF32G|5|I have used this product in the past and always works great.  Gives items a great shine and helps them last longer.  I used this on a spa cover as well as my car for tires and plastic trim.  Works so well someone stole the last order of it off my porch!

B001P4FYC4|1|Mounting slots were too small and had to drill them out to fit the bolts.  Then the pipes sat 3 inches angled down from the rear mount, so the head pipe had to be bent to line up.  After the pipes where installed, the pipes weren't parrellel to each other....but paying for return shipment from hawaii wouldn't been worth it.

B005NLQAHS|3|It is ok, you will get your error codes and erase them, but if you have a BMW or any other high class car, there are other scanners that access their computer in detail and will show you more error codes that this scanner do not.

B000CEN2IG|4|Should include connectors, but does the job as described.

B0049MX8N6|3|The Hitch itself fit perfectly,but the bolts for the frame rails had incorrect threads for the welded in nuts. A trip to the hardware store was required to buy $8.40 worth of correct metric bolts. Then all went well

B0002MA9WA|5|Works just as described. Fits the 2 x 12&#34; Douglas Fur plank perfectly. Calculation provided to determine best board length based on desired ramp height. Worth the extra few dollars for the bottom ramp fitting.

(The pictures don't do them justice).

B00WWYB7CM|5|Just like image
B00V7UUQXI|5|The light is very bright and the casing is sturdy so im expecting this to last real longer. The side mounting helps you to position it the way you wanted to and without any problem. Glad we got one.<br />I was provided a discount for this item in exchange for a honest review.
B0085IJNNY|5|Good price good product.

B00E3BRSNE|1|Did not fit my 2008 Hyundai Santa Fe.  Only one of the 4 adapters had the correct thread pattern and that adapter left about a one inch gap between the antenna and base.  The plastic cover provided was not big enough to bridge the gap.  While they will refund my money, I am having to pay return shipping on a product that did not fit as advertised.

B00061SGJ0|4|We used the kit to replace the lower front ball joints on a 99 Grand Marquis and it worked as expected. It seemed strong and we needed that as the ball joint was really corroded/stuck into the control arm.  Be aware that it might not be as universally useful as some people would like.

B0076YE4QO|5|Drove about 1100 miles with this on the roof of my boyfriend's CRV. We had a Tule on top of it. Thing held up incredibly well. Yes, the feet have cheap plastic/rubber bindings, but they did not scratch our vehicle and the Tule was secured throughout the whole trip. Definitely worth the investment if you are not planning on using them all of the time, however they may last quite a while if you are using them a lot. We just needed them for this single trip, so I cannot attest to the longevity of them. Overall highly recommend for first roof rack purchase. Also a plus, this should fit any car top since it sits flat on the roof.
B009OEMJL6|5|I have replaced this door twice with a factory part. This one is thicker where the others broke. I hope and believe this will be the last time I will have to replace it. I remove the 3 screws and dropped the blower motor and side the door up through the hole rather than cut the gill like it the instructions. It is easy and works just as good without having to cut anything.
B00BMEV80E|5|Part was not right for what I needed now I have no idea how to return it

B00OXWZ60A|5|Yes the spacer worked great
B004GCMWAE|5|This is a OEM replacement for my 1998 Samurai.  I am fabricating a steel skeletal frame, that the bumper fits over to provide for a more rigged bumper system.  The OEM bumper alone is quite weak, but I did not want  a massive brush bumper at six times the price.
B003BMNEI4|5|OE quality
B006QH550Q|5|good
B00CP3X1WE|5|Great cover for our trike! It keeps the bike dry and protected!
B00BITHLBI|3|These work fine, but break very very easily.  It is necessary to warn people to be gentle on them.
B00TS0ICB2|5|Bought this for my husband and he loves it. Stylish and safe!
B007Y87BBC|5|excellent
B00XPNPE50|4|Looked great.  Very small packaging though so be careful or you could easily throw it away if you're also going through something else.  I thought it was going to come with a 'pack' of dots but it only came as one single sticker.  Probably advertised that way and I missed it but think you should at least get a pair - most cars usually have at least two keys....product works well though.
B002Q1MKYK|5|Looks great...easy to apply. It's only double back tape so hopefully it holds up over the long run.
B00V0R7LVI|5|work great on my vw...

B00V5YOBFA|1|This is the worst mounting system ever, None of the bolts fit! The washers were very thin and didn't even work. The mount it self took a long time to fit into place and didn't fit properly at first. I would not suggest this light bar to anyone! The LED's were broken and only half turned on, water got in side the glass the first day! Save your time and money and don't purchase this light bar!
