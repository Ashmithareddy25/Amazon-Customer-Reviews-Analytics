B000HC2LI0|5.0|I have been enjoying these on Amazon Instant but my grandfather doesn't do computers so I purchased this set for him for Christmas.  He loves it!  It was delivered in ONE DAY and he's been watching a few episodes every day for weeks.  Perfect gift.

B008MM9630|4.0|its great, but it's a little annoying that half the items in the game cost gems whitch cost real money
0399226907|5.0|A true children's classic.  Great board book quality that is nice and durable for the baby.  He loves the colors and pictures.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This book was amazingly and wonderfully exactly what I needed. I can't wait to see the film adaptation as soon as possible.
1932100660|1.0|The entire book is based on a study he did with rats who were given dried casein, a milk protein. He says he found out that this dried casein produced liver cancer. Then he makes a HUGE logical extension -- if dried casein does this, then ALL animal proteins must do this. He even calls this a \\"belief\\" of his. My jaw dropped when I read this. How can you generalize from casein to all animal proteins? Why not generalize to all milk proteins? Or all protein in general?<br /><br />After five minutes of online research I found an article finding that dehydrating casein makes it carcinogenic, presumably because it is exposed to oxygen and light. So you can't even generalize to all casein products (i.e., milk).<br /><br />Please, when you read a book like this, map out in your mind the argument of the author and make sure it really makes sense. I'm amazed at all the positive reviews by people who didn't catch this fatal logical error.
B003O86FMW|4.0|This second book was a great way to give us more of the characters of Panem.  I can not wait to see how the it turns out.

B008TT7CXW|4.0|Title says it all. not much else to say. For me it is a little to fat to fit inn my wallet.
B0086700CM|3.0|kinda fun and addictive.  not sure it will be a lasting facination but worth trying and I do keep coming back to it.

0452295548|4.0|My 79-year-old mom recently had a series of strokes causing pretty severe damage to her left and frontal areas of the brain. Dr. Bolte Taylor also experienced damage to her left brain, but at a young age (different type of stroke). This book has a lot of interesting and relevant information about how the brain works, and I found a lot of it very helpful to understanding what happened to my mom. However, I suspect the recovery ability of the brain is very different if you have a hemorrhage-type of stroke in your 30s, than a clot-type of stroke in old age. Definitely worth reading.
B009GEEMLY|2.0|Downey should stick with Ironman movies only. This was not a great flick. Plot line was very predictable and not worthy of Downey's talent.
B0057UD49M|4.0|I have always passed on graphic novels, associating them with the comic books of my youth.  But it was definitely an adult work and rather compelling.  I did find it somewhat repetitive. The same thoughts were drawn and written multiple times.  It was difficult to read on my Kindle DVX.  It looked much better on my spouse's Ipad.<br />Overall its' a sad story of a young girl growing up lesbian with a father who was gay and closeted.  The father eventually commits suicide as his world becomes more hostile.  I suppose most gay men were in that state in those decades.  The basic ethos of the novel was the contrast between her experience as a homosexual and her father's.  It made me wonder if lesbian daughters of gay men have a special bond.<br />\\"Fun Home: A Family Tragicomic\\" is part of my suggested reading for a MOOC course,  \\"The Modern an the Post Modern.\\"
B00112GVFO|5.0|This was a very good movie!  Lots of action and adventure! Good actor choices for this too!! good choice for a family movie night
B0084IG8TM|5.0|Excellent film and downloaded easily and played well on my Kindle Fire. I also enjoyed the special features on the disc. Very good information about the making of the movie.
B002MQYOFW|1.0|It's been awhile since I've read a book with young children at home but not only did I read this book it transported me into the story that I had a hard time putting down!  So now I will dive into the next book in this series.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|Bought this for my daughter for Christmas and she loved it!  She downloaded it onto her iPad and read it in 2 days.
B00AHSMDQY|4.0|I wasn't disappointed in this flick but it can be very dark at times. C Bale is a very good actor and brings his talent in portraying the Dark Knight to a conclusion. Hard to find anything uplifting with this flick.
B00A0R0CG0|5.0|Great fun for family! We've enjoyed every one of the ice age flicks!  Have on Kindle, phone & DVD. Recommend highly
B009FZHYKU|5.0|was very good a liffhanger as usual  always leaving you wanting to comeback for more and not wanting it to end
B00846REIS|5.0|Very intense reading! Loved it! Love getting the insight to other people's lives regarding life's, work sex and so on.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I've only played what is offered for free so far, but I have to say I'm intrigued. I'm very curious about the bad guy and the knife thrower, and there were definitely some moments that startled me. Well worth at least playing through what's free.
B006BAEQB2|5.0|Excellent!!!  I would give it twenty stars if I could. But this is one of my favorite historical authors. I have read pretty much all of her books. Thank you so much Philippa Gregory. Can't wait for your next book!!!
B009IRVSVQ|3.0|This CD was a bit of a disappointment. There are a few songs where Bruno uses the F bomb and a few other foul language words. He has so much talent this is a real distraction from his voice.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I loved this book!  It was recommended by my sister and I could not put it down.  I cannot wait to read more by Colleen Hoover if this is and indication of how great of an author she is.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|Love this movie. It was a great deal too and arrived quickly. Missed out on the digital copy as it expired before I got to download it but no big deal.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I'm reading this to my homeroom class of 43 8th graders. They whined about me reading to them for the first couple of days but now they're hooked. I start reading and all 43 are listening! Great story with great life lessons.
B000N3ST8O|5.0|While Stevie Nick's concert DVDs, epsecially her most recent concert DVD, filmed in Chicago, are super outstanding. This is the Ulimate/Comprehensive Greatest Hits, collection of songs & dvd music videos, spanning her entire musical career as a solo artist, along with her great backing bands.<br /><br />The Music Videos are fantastic, and simply \\"Awesome\\". This is well worth the CD/DVD package just for the Music Videos along. You can just watch the videos, or you can watch the videos along with Stevie's commentary, at your option. Also, the CD portion of this deal is really, really \\"Awesome\\" also. It contains a great mix of her greatest hits, spanning her entire carrer. Plus, you get some alterantive verisons of some of these greatest hits.<br /><br />Overall, this is a \\"must-have\\", \\"very treasured\\", \\"very entertaining\\" CD/DVD package for any Stevie Nicks Fan.<br /><br />Stevie Nicks will be touring with Fleetwood Mac on their 2013 World Tour. I can't wait. I've already bought my tickets for thier concert in Little Rock, Arkansas.<br />\\"Long Live The Queen of Rock & Roll - The One & Only - Stevie Nicks\\"!!!!!!
B003UBTX6S|3.0|Although not quite as good as the first, I was totally entertained by this one. I can't wait to see how they make  the great barrier in the movie.  I will definitely continue on with the next book!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|does what it's supposed to what more can you ask. haven't had any incorrect calculations thus far great job yo
B007FEFLTO|4.0|I enjoyed the book, however, it did seem as though I had read it before somewhere...  Of course the WW2 setting is always interesting, and the length of the book and writing style was entertaining... but it still seemed as though I had read it before.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|There really are no words to correctly express how amazingly thrilling these books are. THANK YOU E L James :)
0316056871|5.0|Dry and saracastic. Just the way I like it. I admire Tina Fey's outlook on life and sense of humor. Her book is a funny and lighthearted read on her career and personal life.
B009GESJH2|5.0|UPDATE: Well as I stated in my title, after I saw Kid Rock & The Brown Trucker Band perform songs from this CD, at a concert last night, February 13, 2013 in Bossier City, Louisiana, I was really, really impressed with these songs. Kid Rock & band performed almost, if not every song on this CD, and the songs were \\"AWESOME\\". At first, I thought this was just a good solid rock album, but now, I see it as being \\"awesome\\", and being another Kid Rock \\"landmark album\\".<br /><br />The show/concert last night from the \\"Rebel Soul\\" Tour was totally \\"awesome\\". You got pyrotechnics, a confetti drop, a balloon drop, & a beach ball drop, plus a spectacular light show, with 2 big screens for close-up shots. At the T-Shirt shop, there was a huge collection of concert T-Shirts with the \\"Kid Rock - Rebel Soul Tour\\" Logo on them, plus a \\"Cucci Galore\\" poster, a \\"Let's Ride\\" License Plate,  plus alot of other great stuff.<br /><br />The songs like \\"Chickens in the Pen\\", \\"Let's Ride\\", \\"Catt Boogie\\", \\"Detroit Michigan\\", \\"Rebel Soul\\", \\"God Save Rock & Roll\\", \\"HAPPY NEW YEAR/LET'S GET S*** FACED\\", \\"Celebrate\\", \\"The Mirror\\", \\"Mr.Rock & Roll\\", \\"Cucci Galore\\", \\"Redneck Paradise\\", \\"Cocaine & Gin\\", & \\"Midnight Ferry\\", were all \\"awesome\\". Of course Kid Rock & band performed classic songs from his prior albums as well.<br /><br />After listening to this CD again, after the \\"Rebel Soul\\" Tour, Show/Concert in Bossier City, last night, I'd definitely have to rate it as a definite 5 STAR ALL THE WAY!!! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS ALBUM CD. THANKS!!!!!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I wouldn't have looked twice at these books, but then I saw the movie and all that changed - had to read them all! The third book was a bit drawn out and my attention waned half way through, but perservered and it was excellent!
B000000OU0|5.0|Some new songs and just enough oldies to make this one of the best of all times. I would recommend this one to any tried and true Eagles fan.
B0018QQQK8|4.0|Quite entertaining, and compared to what else is out there these days, actually pretty good.  Perhaps not enough detail, though, and short.
B0083GQ2A0|4.0|Just like all the other reviewers, I could wish for a different ending.  But for that it would be 5 stars.
B005K2Z2O2|4.0|Good product and protects the Kindle well when travelling or in your work bag. Heaps of other styles were available.
B009HV2JT8|3.0|I bought this for my husband for Christmas, because he wanted to see it when it was in theaters, but didn't get a chance.  He said it was ok.  He said it was really gory, but he doesn't mind that.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|I love how she incorporates her thoughts and sides notes it really helped me understand her situation better. She is such a strong amazing woman and made a horrible situation a tolerable one with the will to survive. I really hope someday she will write a follow up. I now completely understand why it so important to her to keep her daughters out of the media, truly amazing mother.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is the best book i ever read. Indeed she takes your breath away. I love this book!! Congrats author!!!
B007TNS6JI|5.0|fun game play easy to learn controls and great graphics for a free game on a kindle fire.  not much rpg element
B002DEI4NG|5.0|didn't expect to like it, can't stop watching it.  the 2 main characters are so charismatic. I wouldn't have enjoyed this as much if I weren't a parent, I don't think.
B0083P1QUM|3.0|Kay Scarpetta is back -- I was initially ambivalent about buying this book, given I didn't care for the quality of the last two but reluctantly made the plunge.  I was pleased to see somewhat of a return to the basics with less emphasis on wild conspiracies or the ongoing ponderous drama of Scarpetta's personal life (husband in witness protection -- thought to be dead but not, niece blackballed by the government agencies, etc).<br /><br />Background:  this story focuses on a serial killer who has apparently sent a video clip to Scarpetta to taunt her.  The entire plot involves Kay linking two deaths to multiple other deaths and drawing the connection to a central figure.<br /><br />The Good:<br /><br />1.  More focus on the case than Kay's relationships.  I confess I tired of her niece's antics, Benton's strange life, and Kay being at the center of every killer's thought pattern (or so it seemed).  This book focuses much more on the case and how Kay prosecutes the case, so there's more emphasis on the process and detective work.<br /><br />2.  The characters seem to have more normal roles and functions.  Kay's niece assists with her unique skills but doesn't go overboard, Benton is more the normal FBI agent doing his duty and Marino is handled adeptly in a storyline that is fitting and appropriate.<br /><br />3.  The case is interesting with an engaging plotline -- the pacing is smooth and easy to follow.<br /><br />The Less than Good:<br /><br />1.  Fixation:  Kay must be the only medical examiner in the world that is ultimately targeted for death or becomes the enemy of every serial killer on the planet.  This plot feature gets old.  When was the last time we opened the paper and a medical examiner was the target of a killer or convoluted conspiracy?  In reality, you never even know the name of the medical examiner involved in a murder case!  I realize this is what sells the books but sheesh, Kay, you're not THAT important to the safety of the planet.  Why can't we just focus on telling a plausible, interesting, engaging, seiral killer story without making Kay the killer's focus all the time?<br /><br />2.  Plot:  it's generally solid.  However, at the end, I was left wondering why the killer notified Kay of his crime by sending the video.  It seems like he was asking to be caught by challenging her directly -- guess this is the point of the story, but it didn't seem to match the overall motives for the other killings.  In other words, the killer wasn't killing for attention, he was killing for deeply personal (and psycho) reasons -- it wasn't supposed to be a challenge against authority.<br /><br />3.  Characterization:  Kay seems unusually focused on whether Benton is cheating on her and on her attraction to other men in this book.  It's perplexing.  After all they've been through, this is a concern?  I mean, he was \\"dead\\" (in witness protection) and they've worked out far more serious issues and our number 1 all-star ME is worried about being hot for two other guys or Benton's fidelity?  Ugh.<br /><br />All in all, it's a solid read.  I'd like to see the pricing come down to the once-promised 9.99 range as I hate paying 14.99 for ebooks but that's a different topic.  Die-hard Scarpatta fans will probably love this, for me it was a solid okay.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Great time waster! Hard to get acorns, which is why they are available to buy. Boo! I want a blue crab!!
B00702MUYA|5.0|I don't know why I waited almost a year after its release to buy \\"Old Songs\\" because I lost a year of listening to this magic that is L. Cohen. This album is mesmerizing; I have been drinking it in since I bought the MP3 version. I'm going to get the CD just in case I lose my data. I would also like to see the artwork on the cover. Bless L. Cohen: his lyrics are the best poetry ever written; his voice still whispers in my ear - human, sometimes sad, sometimes spooky, always personal, always trademark! The music is spellbinding. It touches a place deep inside of me that I never show anyone because I don't know how. I love every song on this album but I think \\"Amen\\" is going to become another classic. How could anyone not love this man and his music? He allows himself to be masterful, tongue-in-cheek, and completely vulnerable, at different times. He's a chameleon. He doesn't do it for the glory; he has enough historical presence to last forever. He does it for the love of it. When he sings \\"Sleep Baby Sleep\\" I feel safe. I don't know why. He challenges me to be a better person. He is a man to emulate. This is music to appreciate. I've been there since the beginning and I'm not going anywhere. Soak this one in, it'll fill your pores and help you learn to fly.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I saw the movie before I read this and I have to say the book is far more moving and beautiful than the movie. I understand that many of the things that are in the book can't possible make on screen due to time. This story is so moving and just filled with anger, sadness, and just really good. I recommend it and suggest reading the book prior to watching the film.
B008XG1X18|5.0|A app to keep track of and to modify those pins that everyone loves to see and review for their pleasure and to learn new things.
B009NPKTN6|2.0|Great music, great play, beautiful actress, didn't translate from stage to big screen. I loved the play but it came across as forced and corny on big screen.
B0042JH0EE|4.0|It was nice seeing all these old songs played by a great band using the ORIGINAL arrangements. After all, you don't bring in three of the Motown studio players and tell them to learn new parts. The band sounds great but even on DTS the guitars, bass and keyboards are too often buried in the mix. No doubt Phil could have sung better 20 years ago. But he is being compared to recordings made by guys in their 20's who were always told to sing these songs as high as possible. Phil doesn't have the right look or sound and people singing these songs usually have at least some of the moves. But he succeeds because this is 60's pop. While James Brown, Wilson Pickett and Otis Redding were making great R&B/Soul music, Motown was aiming for the pop charts because that's where the money was. Nothing wrong with that.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|The simplified synopsis:  A chance meeting in a grocery store sends Sky and Holder, high school seniors who both have undeserved reputations, into a relationship that becomes about trust and love and uncovering dark secrets of the past.<br /><br />Hopeless was an emotional read with some not entirely unpredictable twists.  I have to admit I worried over the fact that Holder might turn out to be Sky's brother.  Am I ever glad that didn't turn out to be the case. :)<br /><br />My only problem with this book (aside from wondering how unemployed teenagers come up with so much cash) lies in the dialogue.  After a certain point, 6-year old's who talk like they're 18 and 18-year old's who discuss life as if they're long-practicing psychologists started to wear on me a bit.  I had to make a conscious decision to just go with the flow and not let the believability issues hinder my enjoyment of an otherwise good story<br /><br />So, overall, I'd recommend it.  It's definitely worth a read, but it's not the kind of book I can see myself reading over and over again.<br /><br />Adult language and sexual content.
B00962341U|4.0|Leona Lewis is the type of artist I root for - she is a super talented vocalist who is a low key, drama free young woman which makes it easy for people to classify her as \\"boring\\" and write off her music.  I truly dislike her previous album, ECHO - I listened to it again recently to see if perhaps I'd just been in a very bad mood when I listened to it before but no, that album just doesn't resonate positively to me.  When I heard that Leona was releasing a new album I was very excited to hear it so much so that I bought it from a UK seller as soon as it was available.<br /><br />I love the fact that she's experimented with different sounds on tracks that I keep on repeat like:<br /><br />GLASSHEART: an uptempo track on which she sings in a staccato almost rap-like manner;<br /><br />COME ALIVE & TROUBLE: both have a somewhat dark, atmospheric sound that work with her vocals;<br /><br />SHAKE YOU UP: has a very catchy late 80s pop flavor;<br /><br />FAVOURITE SCAR: love the Tears for Fears sample used along with the catchy lyrics that made it an instant fave.<br /><br />The ballads that I really enjoy are:<br /><br />FINGERPRINTS - beautiful vocal & music arrangement make this an excellent cut to close the album;<br /><br />STOP THE CLOCKS - more of a mid-tempo synthy ballad;<br /><br />FIREFLIES - emotional ballad that gets better when the choir joins in but Leona's soaring vocal closes the song.<br /><br />The following 3 songs are just ok to me: LOVEBIRD - she sounds beautiful on it but while the chorus is somewhat catchy I can take or leave this track; UN LOVE ME - Leona's vocals are great on this mid-tempo break up ballad but...\\"meh\\" and WHEN IT HURTS - just a very forgettable track to me, it didn't stand out in any way (lyrically, vocally or production wise).<br /><br />The only song that I do not like is I TO YOU - it's a ballad with dark lyrics about a downtrodden housewife who's asking her husband \\"what am I to you\\"...<br /><br />I would've switched up the song order because although the songs don't sound alike, the first 6 tracks are either mid-tempos or ballads which caused my mind to wander a bit until SHAKE ME UP truly shook me up.<br /><br />The deluxe cd offers acoustic versions of TROUBLE, COME ALIVE & GLASSHEART and of these TROUBLE is the best because you get to hear just Leona accompanied by a guitar which is a treat (my personal preference is the original versions of the other two songs).  Her cover of COLORBLIND is exquisite as are the two final uptempo tracks, SUGAR & COLLIDE.<br /><br />All in all I enjoy this album and can't wait until she starts promotion in the US.  Given how tricky it is to choose a lead off single, I think TROUBLE was a good choice but I heard that they chose LOVEBIRD as the UK follow-up which was a poor choice in my opinion because while this song is a good album cut, FINGERPRINTS is the better ballad.<br /><br />When they release the album to the US, I wish her label would go balls to the wall and release GLASSHEART to jump start the album.  Yes, it's somewhat risky but it's a great song that is so far out of Leona's ballad \\"wheelhouse\\" that I think people will take notice and give it a chance.<br /><br />I agree with others about the difficulty getting a physical copy of this album - had to buy from a UK vendor who took a loooooong time to deliver it but it was worth the wait.ong order because although the songs don't sound alike, the first 6 tracks are either mid-tempos or ballads which caused my mind to wander a bit until SHAKE ME UP truly shook me up.<br /><br />The deluxe cd offers acoustic versions of TROUBLE, COME ALIVE & GLASSHEART and of these TROUBLE is the best because you get to hear just Leona accompanied by a guitar which is a treat (my personal preference is the original versions of the other two songs).

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|My reaction when I finished this book: Oh. My. God. I think this book literally changed my perspective on life. It's so tragically beautiful that after you read the last words you sit there, in complete silence, and rethink everything over, and start to cry, in both despair and relief. I usually am not one to cry over books, but The Fault in Our Stars had me sobbing. Augustus' and Hazel's love is so pure and true. The whole book, even though it is fiction, is so honest about love and life. My thoughts about this book are \\"thoughts I cannot fathom into constellations\\". I recommend this book to anyone and everyone, young or older, this book is completely and utterly amazing.<br /><3333
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Loved every bit except for the ending!  It ended too soon. I want to know what happened to the kids!
B0014D6PCO|5.0|The Dark Knight was actually the first of the three batmen movies I saw of this trilogy back in 2008 when it was on dvd/blu-ray. I watched this the day The Dark Knight Rises was released and was not let down. This movie was great, had a good story behind it and never had a boring moment.
B008EZVNFE|5.0|WOW! was my reaction after listening to this the first time.  I've gotten into a very bad habit of buying cds & putting them on my mp3 player without listening to them first so I never know what to expect of new artists.  However each time one of these tracks played, I found myself smiling because it was so good & also pulling out the player so that I could check for the artist.  Finally I listened to the entire album in one sitting and fell in love with it.<br /><br />Lianne is a singer/songwriter whose lyrics are way beyond a 22 yr old, her vocal style is unique - smoky, airy and reminiscent of Sade on certain tracks while on others she displays strong, confident more powerful vocals. The album is also well constructed with excellent song placement and enough tempo changes so that I was never bored. I love that she is confident in her own style and didn't chase trends in order to make her music fit in with what's hot right now.  These are the type of songs I'll listen to over & over and will probably reach for this album when I'm a senior citizen because they touched my heart and made me feel something.<br /><br />Honestly the only 2 songs that I like but don't love are: FORGET & TEASE ME.  The songs that I flipped over and keep pressing the repeat button on are: EVERYTHING EVERYTHING, DON'T WAKE ME UP, ELUSIVE, LOST & FOUND, GONE, NO ROOM FOR DOUBT & THEY COULD BE WRONG.<br /><br />I hope she gets more chances to perfom in the US so that more people can be introduced to her music.
1401324649|1.0|My book club chose this book and that's why I'm struggling to finish it.  It's not my kind of book.  Its a combination of Forrest Gump and the Keystone Kops; just not my cup of tea.  The writing is simplistic and it's very predictable.  The only saving grace is a little historical fact mixed in.
B0087GF8ZG|5.0|We have a wiring problem - the switch in that bathroom controls both the light AND the outlet - so there is no way to put a nightlight into the bathroom.  This gizmo is exactly what we needed - we just turn it on at bedtime, turn it off in the morning.  Works very well, and has a nice clear (but not blinding, which is not what you want at 2AM) light.  Good product, I'm happy with it.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book was amazing. I've always loved diary of a wimpy kid . Although the book was kind of short, it was still very good. I recommend it for kids mainly teens
B000000WFZ|5.0|This is wonderful music, although haunting, and not real &#34;happy&#34; music.  This is music that really captures the story in the orchestration.  Ennio Morricone is a master at that!  I highly recommend this.
B000OBYLVO|4.0|Great addition to a video library for those who relish the somewhat cheesy genre of Christmas movies - beautiful scenery and settings in addition to big star acting makes for an easy and enjoyable film you could watch during the holidays again and again over the years.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This was probably one of the best books I have ever read. It was heartwarming and heart wrenching. I love sky she was funny I had many \\"LOL\\" moments in this book I wish is wasn't a ebook only so I could by a couple for home but oh well can't wait fir college's next book
B00A9X9VAI|3.0|I liked it.  it was a little slow sometimes but it was ok.  Interesting how they worked the time travel.

B00APUYWYA|4.0|The movie was comedic and rebel Wilson was the ultimate scene stealer.  I just wish the singing had been on par with Glee.
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|I love the sound of this, the melody (mostly minor chords) the vocals and lyrics are beautiful, unique and somewhat haunting.  I highly recommend this.
0802473156|5.0|A great look into one of the least trained but most important skills in life.  True communication and a basis for understanding others.  Excellent condition and fast delivery
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Nicholas Sparks diverges from his usual fare with a suspenseful novel about a woman trying to escape from an abusive husband.

B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Great puzzles and graphics! Recommending this app to everyone. It really makes you think. I actually missed a key the first time and had to start over but it was cool because the games change each time.
B005LAIIGC|5.0|I absolutely FELL IN LOVE with this Movie Immediately!! I saw it with my Husband (We are Parents of 3, my husband & I are both 31yrs old) and our kiddos ages 12, 8, and 6, WE ALL Loved the Movie. It is Fast Paced, Funny, Touching, and a Story to dream about. I can't say enough about this movie, yet I do not want to spoil it for anyone! Yet Do you know why the tooth fairy collects teeth? Watch this movie to find out! Yes Santa has Tattoos and welds big swords, and the Easter Bunny is a Bad-A** but the characters are done perfectly. We all have layers to our souls and we are all perfect the way we are. Beautiful Movie- Perfect for the Family. I hope everyone can see this movie the way I do- I truly believe that parents are going to love this movie as much, if not MORE than their kids! I already bought it for pre-release! Its a MUST Own!
B002JIEYK8|5.0|This album has been dissed in the media and let me tell you - they've got it all wrong. Technical Ecstasy was the album where it sounded like everyone was fried (except Iommi - great guitar work on T.E.). But Never Say Die lives up to its title perfectly. There's some GREAT, tragically overlooked songs on here - &#34;Junior's Eyes&#34; takes up where the Sabotage album left off. &#34;Air Dance&#34; is absolutely beautiful, with the experimental vibe & dynamics that were present on the Sabbath Bloody Sabbath & Vol 4 albums. &#34;Johnny Blade&#34; is the song that successfully moves the band forward into new-ish territory. Just listen to Ozzy sing &#34;Well you know that Johnny's a spider - and his web is the city at night&#34;... CLASSIC!!! Geezer Butler should be especially proud of his work here - the bass very clear in the mix and the guy just nails everything he does awesomely! Bill Ward is in top form as mad scientist / percussion artiste. And Iommi's guitar work contains hints of what was to come on the Heaven & Hell album. The only song that doesn't need to be on here is &#34;Swinging The Chain&#34;; no offense to Bill Ward on lead vocals whatsoever - the song just is SO not Black Sabbath. A textbook definition of &#34;filler&#34;. Many people will say the same for &#34;Breakout&#34; with the horn section. That's right folks, a horn section in a Sabbath tune. The thing is - it's so trippy and bizarre that it works perfectly. That's this listener's opinion anyway. I think they really pulled it together here, as if they knew it was possibly curtains for them, burned out as they were. In a perfect world, Never Say Die would have come out in '76 and Technical Ecstasy (with a proper mix) in '78. Then Ozzy could dis that last album he did with Sabbath and it would make more sense. I hope Rick Rubin has them sit down and listen to this while they're making the new album!
B00A81NFAS|5.0|What kind of romantic comedy do you prefer? Classics, such as It Happened One Night, Pretty Woman and Roman Holiday, or something quirky, like Annie Hall or Harold and Maude? Silver Linings Playbook has more drama present than most romantic comedies, but it still belongs in that category. It would also be classified as somewhat quirky.<br /><br />Mental illness isn't funny, but I don't think that any subject should be off limits when it comes to comedy. The key is doing it with respect and a degree of realism. For example, cancer is one of the most unpleasant things in existence, but 50/50 was a comedy that worked, because the screenplay allowed us to see some of the seriousness of the situation. Silver Linings Playbook follows the same path.<br /><br />If you have ever seen As Good as It Gets, you might have some idea what to expect from Silver Linings Playbook. Both films feature incredibly good actors, who are capable of mixing drama with comedy. Both include serious scenes that an average actor might struggle with. The two stories revolve around unlikely romances, that shouldn't work, but it feels right when they do.<br /><br />Jennifer Lawrence has to be one of Hollywood's hottest properties. She received an Oscar nomination for Winter's Bone, and has reached huge audiences by appearing in X-Men: First Class, and The Hunger Games. I'm sure a lot of people saw Silver Linings Playbook just because Lawrence was involved. She's certainly attractive, but she can really act too. This role requires more than just a pretty face, and she pulls it off with apparent ease.<br /><br />The setting reminds me of Russell's last film, The Fighter; it's gritty and realistic, and full of dramatic scenes. Families often become involved in shouting matches rather than sitting down to have rational conversations. Two actors won Oscars in that film, and I wouldn't be surprised to see another nomination go to Lawrence for her work here.<br /><br />The story focuses on Pat Solitano (Bradley Cooper), who we see being released from a mental institution. He is married, and has plans to reconnect with his wife. He is friendly and calm most of the time, but can sometimes snap. One trigger is a song, and sometimes he hears it in his head when it's not even playing. Pat moves in with his mother (Jacki Weaver) and father (Robert De Niro), and walks into their bedroom at 3am for insignificant reasons. His judgment is not exactly reliable.<br /><br />Pat's life begins to change when he meets Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence), who is the sister-in-law of one of his friends. She's direct and irrational at times, and it soon becomes clear that she has problems of her own. The two enter into a sort of alliance and become friends. Tiffany agrees to give a letter to Pat's wife if he'll train with her and enter a dance contest that she wants to be a part of.<br /><br />De Niro is funny in almost every scene in which he appears. He plays a Philadelphia Eagles fan, and he's convinced that his actions, and the actions of those around him, have an effect on the team's results. One of the best scenes in the film occurs when Tiffany confronts him about his superstitions.<br /><br />Chris Tucker is also funny in all of his scenes. He was a fellow patient at the mental institution and seems to care about what happens to Pat.<br /><br />Another huge plus is the soundtrack. Led Zeppelin finally allowed songs to be used in movies and ads, and the placing of What is and what should never be is particularly effective. You'll also hear The White Stripes, Alabama Shakes, Bob Dylan and Johnny Cash, Stevie Wonder, and the Eagles of Death Metal. It's one of the best soundtracks of 2012.<br /><br />I won't ruin the outcome, but it's fun to see Pat and Tiffany work through their problems. It's good to see a film avoid the usual romantic comedy formula and come up with some original ideas. Comedy works best when it surprises you, rather than something which tries to make you laugh with every action or line of dialogue. It's well-written and well-acted, with a number of memorable scenes. Catch it while it's still in theaters if you can.<br /><br />Overall score 4.5/5ry action or line of dialogue. It's well-written and well-acted, with a number of memorable scenes. Catch it while it's still in theaters if you can.<br /><br />Overall score 4.5/5
B0058YPGVQ|5.0|Plenty of suspense, action and drama in a well written and fast moving story. One of the best series on television!
B00AMBLDEE|4.0|In this movie has lots of suspense and action, with nice scenery from mountains. Jeremy and Rachel look really good in the action movie.

B002MQYOFW|4.0|The book is full of action that keeps Your attention.  My granddaughter told me about the series<br />She also saw the movie
1936608618|3.0|This is a good book for those who are entering the world of triathlons or other endurance sports.  The basics are perfectly combined with an good argument for mixing strength training into endurance training regiment.  For those athletes at higher levels, this book offers very little, maybe a cliff note version of what exist for free on the crossfit endurance website and the crossfit site.  In a nut shell: Beginners buy, veteran endurance athletes go to websites.
B00APUQRPC|5.0|A good movie from the heart. With the relationship between father & doughter. And the search of baseball players. Everyone should see this movie.

B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|Hi, this is my first review for any product, but I just wanted to say this mouse is absolutely amazing.<br /><br />The precision, and comfort of the design is perfect, and I love the software, and customizing colors. A really great mouse.<br /><br />I got it from my friend Taylor M. as a gift, and it's the best mouse I've ever used. Definitely worth the price if buying new!

B008RV5K5E|5.0|Great edition to the Batman saga.  Very enjoyable worth watching and was a great purchase.  My family enjoyed watching the continuing saga of the Dark Knight.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|A great read!  It took me a few pages to get into the style of writing, but once I did I really enjoyed it.
B005COO1X6|3.0|My grandmother read this book and she said it was okay wished there were more to the story and better climax.
B008N1LL42|5.0|Great for the Navy!  Only wish it was an Aircraft Carrier!  Special effects were amazing.  Will enjoy watching again and again!

B00A8ECU24|5.0|By far the best app of all time. Because EqD AND /mlp/ are working together to make this the top app on all markets, Im excited!
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|By far Big Fish's best game. Really fun &amp; quite spooky which I enjoyed. Thanks for a really thought out well made game. Great length &amp; worth the three bucks.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I love the game but why make grad type dragons have like 100 coins per minute when the habitat only can support 500..... I was hoping that maybe makers could make the amuont of coins it can hold larger like the ice type habitat
B007J4T2G8|3.0|My grandmother read this book and she said it was okay wished there were more to the story and better climax.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|The world the author builds is interesting and engaging. I give it only four stars though, because I found the 'relationship building and romance angles as well as a lot of the character building to be contrived boring info dump - like it was added later to justify some of the plot twists. So I just scanned large portions of the book til the interesting plot started up again.<br /><br />But definitely worth the read. There are more mysteries to uncover in this world and I will undoubtedly buy more!
B0040JHL0Y|5.0|it was just what we expected in size and color.  the shoes fit perfectly.  it seems we never go wrong with the brooks brand.
B00AE2IJIE|5.0|We rented this for the kids and the kids and mom and dad watched it and we all enjoyed it.
B00ADIT8U2|5.0|This game was so refreshing. I thought I wouldn't like it because there are no hidden object scenes and that ended up being a huge reason why I enjoyed it so much. Great story with a nice ending.  Thanks ICOOLgeeks more please.
B0066WJLU6|2.0|I didn't like this but I didn't have a need for it either. Even if there was a storm, lights out, no power.....no WI-FI / Internet then you can't really have an emergency need for it because it has to be uploaded to you from the source.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|This movie was awesome from every aspect, especially the action, pace, and special effects, which were VERY convincing! Highly recommend!
B0082RHRHC|5.0|It meant more to me now at 25 than I ever understood at 14.  I can think of few books that have been more touching.
B003EY7IUY|3.0|Very funny in the beginning, but the last half was so over the top ridiculous I just wanted to finish it.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book wasn't as sexually deviant as some of the other people claim.  Not that I'm into S&M.  What I really likee about it was the psychological aspects of it as things unfolded.  Having a BA in Pschology, that is what interested me as she analyzes herself and why this appeals to her.  You can't help but love Christian Grey, despite his choices, but he is a bit too good to be true - rich, young, good looking, blah, blah, blah.  I still loved the book.
B003TT4QEA|1.0|you sent the complete sherlock holmes wrong book and i will not pay for it. vol one instead of vol two.
0800141660|5.0|Although I though Elinore looked too old for the part, she really reached the heart.  Great acting.  For a two hour rendition, this is the best.
B0054R6BFM|5.0|When I finished this book I had goosebumps. My heart was pumping hard and that's how I know that I have read an amazing book. This story will stay with me forever...
0062060562|5.0|This is one of the best thriller books I read in awhile, full of suspense and pace. I thought the subject of memory loss was intense, I enjoyed the characters story. It is one of those books that you have to read to understand how powerful it is. It is amazing how this is the first novel by S.J, he is an exceptional author!
B008XBASVY|5.0|This book was fantastic!!!!! I could relate so closely to Carson. So raw, real, four thumbs up! After reading this, I'm pretty sure I am now in love with Chris Colfer. He is going on to great things.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I did like this follow up to Fifty Shades of Grey.  However, by the middle of it I was so tired of them having sex 24/7 and acting like it was &#34;mind blowing&#34; each and every time.  It really turned into a romance novel after awhile and there wasn't much psychological drama to keep me intertained.  All in all though, it does end the story, atleast in my mind, and I have no real intent to buy the 3rd book.
B001TH16DI|5.0|Great price for all the movies and excited to get them on blu ray! A must buy if you enjoy watching Star Trek!
B00364K6YW|5.0|Great acting.  Best rendition that gives the full scope of what is going on and why.  Other renditions were too short and could not develop every aspect of the story in depth like this one.  Characters were very real in protrayal of their feelings.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I liked the graphics. Not bad for an app. The zoom for the hidden objects is great. I would recommend it.
B008RV5K5E|5.0|This obviously was an animated flm. Those who are confused by the title and mistakingly thought this was the Christian Bale flick are complete idiots if they can't take this wonderful tool known as the internet to realize what exactly they're order. Giving this product 1 star because you're too lazy to take 5 minutes to do some research is ridiculous. It's people like you putting this country into the toilet.<br /><br />MOVIE: I wasn't sure how whether I would like it or not. I've loved WONDER WOMAN, BATMAN: YEAR ONE, BATMAN: UNDER THE RED HOOD and JUSTICE LEAGUE: CRISIS ON TWO EARTHS but wasn't a huge fan of their other productions. After watching this film, I felt satisfied and eager for part 2. Loved Peter Weller as Batman and the music was friggin' good. It reminded me of music that you'd hear in revenge flicks fromm the 70s & 80s.<br /><br />Although this film follows the graphic novel, the director was smart enough not to be beholden to it. He carefully establishes some small scenes that help bridge viewers into this world where the city's at it's most dangerous while an increasingly elderly Bruce Wayne looks on wondering if he still has what it takes. Can he help this city again -- find it's strength in the pit of misery it currently finds itself in?<br /><br />If you're not sure you want to buy it, just rent it. Personally I loved it and can't wait for more.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I have read this book 3 times now! It is an amazing book! Could NOT put it down and read it in one day the first time reading!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Didn't want to put it down! This was an easy read and was well written. This is the best free book I've downloaded.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I use this when I go for chemo. I am a solitaire junkie so this helps pass the time there. I would recommend this.
B000V39KDO|5.0|and I enjoyed every single moment of it. Tell your friends, tell your family to come over and watch this movie for they shall not be disappointed.  I give it 6 stars!!
B0091REZMW|4.0|Nice to see a game that gets you to really look for the clues. Not sure I like that it wants to be logged into Twitter and Facebook though. Was trying to get away from social networking and games.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|My husband and  I really enjoyed Jewels Star. It is very intense on certain levels. I loved it, wish there was a Jewels Star II..........<br />Can't believe this game is free. I would recommend this game to family, friends, and  even foes....  I loved every moment I played this game. Haven't found anything on Amazon that  can be compared to Jewels Star. Please contact me when something like Jewels Star is released.
B006FE83UE|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my mother. I was thrilled to be able to have a digital download for her computer. She has played this movie several times since Christmas. I will definitely be using amazon.com much more frequently for those hard to find purchases.
B0076DELIG|3.0|I found myself not liking Harry in this book.  I think his relationship issues became to much for me.  I still look forward to his next book.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|This was ordered for my daughter - who has become obsessed with H.G.  - she was thrilled to get this for Christmas.
B001AIRUOU|5.0|This disc is great!  Not only a great movie but my daughter says she can put it in the TV and it plays over and over without having to restart it.  Great for when your kids have the TV on all night!
B00APUYWYA|5.0|I was not expecting to enjoy it as much as I did but I did. I recommend to everyone! Thanks!
B004LWZW7O|4.0|This story was a refreshing change for me in Sci-Fi. I really enjoyed the plot. Acting was pretty good. Justin Timberlake surprised me. It was very good.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|This is so much fun. Trying to beat your own score is challenging. The grandkids like it too. I really helps their matching skills. I recommend this for any age group
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I liked it but found it pushed the envelope on believability.  Having everything come together as the story evolved required too much luck for my taste.  Still liked it though.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|As a huge fan of the Percy Jackson series, I was excited and nervous to read this one, but Rick did not disappoint. This series is just as funny, exciting, and engaging as the other books.
B004EPYZSK|5.0|This is such a great movie.  I purchased it for my dad who has everything and he loved it.  He normally likes westerns so I wasnt sure but it was a big hit!
B004I8WD7S|5.0|I've had this for a while now and it's still holding up great. Has taken a few falls and no damage. Installation and removal is easy. I'd get one again but it's held up great and so far no need to replace it.
B00993FEUK|5.0|This movie is fun. I think it's more geared towards adults then children. I think it might be a little scary for kids under 6.  I think this is one of the best stop animation movies of the year!
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Very fun and quite additive!  Too bad it is not really a free game.  Purchase is required to unlock the full version.
0385536828|1.0|Ian McEwan demonstrated in \\"Amsterdam\\" that he can write beautifully and compellingly with an amazing twist.  In \\"Atonement\\" he demonstrated his ability to write in a woman's voice.  In \\"Sweet Tooth\\" he does neither.  I can't believe I wasted my time with the somewhat clunky writing, not the greatest character development,and lack of emotional connection with any of the characters only to get to the ending which is more appropriate to the Bobby Ewing ending to \\"Dallas\\" than to what I looked forward from \\"Sweet Tooth.\\" Don't waste your time.

B008JGSM6G|5.0|It's hard to put down.  It's a great way to kill time. Great way to exercise the brain. Makes you really think.
B0091REZMW|4.0|The game play is great. The graphics &amp; missions are are good too. However, I would like it more if you earned more currency for the game play. You only get a few diamonds but lots of coins, but u newsstands to buy energy in order to play more of the rooms. Still, a good game tho
B008HK3XKO|5.0|PERFECT is all I got to say.  no cons at all.  Solid construction works as stated nice feel to it also.  Fits well in hand any position. Great investment for the small price.  !
0375851569|5.0|I bought these for my son who is 3yo and has trouble with certain sounds and words. He loves the sillyness of these books and the rhyming encourages him to try out new words and sounds, and to sound things out slowly instead of being impatient about them. The product came brand new, shrink wrapped, and the books in the box set are hard cover so thankfully they'll last a long time!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|A necessity for everyone with a facebook page.  A mobile presentation designed for the device is always much better than simply a link to the browser!  Easy to set up and use, even if you are new to social networking.
1612130283|3.0|I suppose that I have been living under a rock because I hadn't even heard of this book series until it made my local news when a local library in a neighboring county was refusing to stock the book and trying to have it banned from the public library system there. I did determine that the librarian felt it was 'pornographic and smutty'.<br /><br />A few nights later, I heard the book series mentioned again when the author, E. L. James, was selected as one of Barbara Walter's most interesting persons of 2012. After seeing the interview, I decided that I would investigate further. After all, Lady Barbara had admitted with a smile that she had read the book herself. So I went to Amazon to purchase it for download to my Kindle Fire and was amazed to see more than 15,000 reviews on Amazon. WOW! I purchased the series and hunkered down for a long night of reading.<br /><br />The first book, 'Fifty Shades of Grey' started a little slow for me. I prefer books that jump right into some type of action that hooks the reader immediately. The story was also told mostly from a first person point of view, and I felt that it really lacked some much needed depth by adopting this style.<br /><br />I did enjoy the email banter that goes on between Anna & Christian, the two main characters. It was good to get to see at least some of Christian's point of view in this way.<br /><br />Overall, the writing is just average, and even choppy in some spots, and there are numerous typos and lots of repetition. I mean how many times can they talk about lip biting and eye rolling in one book? Enough already. Point taken. Please move on to something else.<br /><br />The other thing that really put me off was that the author seems to have lifted the overall premise, point of view, main characters, background, and even some actual scenes straight from the book 'Twilight'. When I heard Ms. James state in the interview that her book was 'Twilight' for adults, I never expected that she meant it so literally. Granted there were no werewolves or vampires in 'Fifty Shades of Grey', but I would have liked to see the author be a little more original. If you have read 'Twilight', these similarities are very evident and recognizable.<br /><br />With that being said, I still thought the basic story was fairly solid. I mean what woman doesn't fantasize about a fabulously wealthy, drop-dead gorgeous, well-built, well sexed, kazillionaire falling head over heels for them, lavishing them with gifts and affection, and changing the darkest parts of himself for the woman he loves. Classic romance. Her love cures him of his twisted sadistic penchants and he turns into her Prince Charming. I think this ideal is why so many women are so enamored with, and crazy about, this series, as well as the Twilight series of books.<br /><br />I did enjoy watching the two main characters, Anna & Christian, grow and mature together throughout this first book, and especially throughout the series. Although Anna starts out very meek, she learns to stand her ground despite risking Christian's controlling wrath. This struggle helps to move the story forward.<br /><br />There is also a dash of intrigue thrown in her and there for good measure, which adds a much needed layer of depth to the story line. There were some parts where I found myself asking, \\"Are they really having sex again?\\"<br /><br />The sex scenes are explicit, ie: for adults only, but then again it is labeled as \\"erotic\\" so that really shouldn't be a surprise to anyone. I really wasn't sure what to expect since the book is also labeled as BDSM (Bondage & Discipline, Dominance & Submission, Sadism and Masochism). I was honestly a little hesitant to start reading this first book as I half expected some really crazy, outlandish, kinky, BDSM stuff, and that really isn't my thing; however, I can now say that I thought the sex scenes were relatively mild (and I imagine a little educational for some)and on par with other erotic romance novels.<br /><br />I must say that I liked the second and third books more than the first, but you need to read the first to get the back story to be able to follow the plot effectively. Overall, I would recommend the series for what it is, a good erotic escape. If you are expecting a masterful literary work then you just might be disappointed.
B0054EU0H0|5.0|great stuff! easy to apply, no bubbles whatsoever! dry install. comes with a microfiber cloth to clean your screen before placing the screen protector. highly recommend!

B009B8YZKS|5.0|For the first live action halo movie, 343 did an excellent job and I must say I was amazed. Thought a Halo movie could never be done, but here it is; hope 343 doesn't stop here.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Enjoyed this book. Am reading the second book even faster than the first. Can't wait for the third and am sure I'll want it to continue.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I think the title of this review pretty much says it all: I thoroughly enjoyed every moment of this book.  The only problem I had with it came about when reading before going to sleep: I would be so engaged in the setting and the characters that I would think about the book all night rather than sleeping.  It permeated my dreams and I would spend time during my work day thinking about it.  This was the best $6 I've spent, and I've already sent it as a gift to my best friend.  Read this book.
B004U52VPS|3.0|My five year old son was excited for this game, but he plays with the toys more than the game, and uses the cards to build houses. So we're satisfied, but I probably won't buy more of this type of Angry Bird toy. One is enough.
B007FC3AAI|5.0|i got it for my daughter . she just love robert and kirsten stewart. good movie to fall asleep to.
B0077ATSSQ|5.0|Without a doubt, this is one of the most amazing films I've seen this decade, if not ever! In all my years, I don't think I've ever seen something that deals with the loss of a parent in such an honest way. Yes, even though the bulk of the story kind of comes across like a fairy tale, the themes it deals with and how they are handled are some of the most realistic I've ever seen committed to film.<br /><br />I remember being excited to see this when it came out, and the wait was well worthwhile. Unlike another kind of similar tale about a youth's search for meaning in the midst of life's turmoils that I was excited to see when it came out, but ended up being disappointed with, \\"Where The Wild Things Are\\", I felt there was never a moment in this that wasn't just extremely brilliant and beautiful and moving.<br /><br />Being someone who lost my father a few years ago (he died unexpectedly of a heart attack), I relate to everything Oskar went through emotionally in this film, as I'm sure anyone else who's lost a parent will do. I felt this movie captured all the raw emotions and feelings that a person experiences after such a great loss, ranging from grief, anger, confusion, anger, feelings of euphoria from lack of sleep, anger, to even assessing blame on the surving parent.<br /><br />I was also very moved by the way the film dealt with generational themes, depicted beautifully between Oskar and the tenant in his grandmother's house (Max Von Sydow). The endurance of learning self respect and love and respect for others passed on from one generation to the next was so wonderfully depicted.<br /><br />Sorry, but I'm not going to go into plot scenarios here. If you want that, read someone else's review. I feel the plot has been disussed enough in so many other well written reviews. What I'm trying to share here is my experience and emotions while wathing the film. This is something that made me weep unabashedly, and I'm not ashamed to admit that. Yes, this is a deeply moving film, and even has some very depressing moments, but it is not an overall depressing film; and it also has some very magnificent enlightening moments, capturing the beautiful bonds of family relationships that will just take your breath away.<br /><br />And let me just say that the acting from the cast in this is some of the best I've ever seen from any of them. I honestly don't think I've ever seen better work from any of them before. Why the Academy didn't recognize their work in this is beyond me.<br /><br />As you can already probably guess, I HIGHLY recommend this movie! Thank you. :>)<br /><br />Randall Brooks<br />(author, \\"The Two Worlds of the Mind\\")ving film, and even has some very depressing moments, but it is not an overall depressing film; and it also has some very magnificent enlightening moments, capturing the beautiful bonds of family relationships that will just take your breath away.<br /><br />And let me just say that the acting from the cast in this is some of the best I've ever seen from any of them.

B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Great layouts that range from easy and quick to hard ones that will drive you nuts. It is easy to navigate the game features. The only one downside to this free game is the ads that appear when you finish a level. All in all a fun time.
B0077ZNCE2|5.0|needed to see it again before going to see Part 2.  While the series did wind down a bit in this segment, I still love it.  The final was excellent also!!
B00AKKGX4W|4.0|Fun and sexy. I would recommend it to anyone wanting a good fun read. Not what i expected but plesantly surprised
B008CLI4N4|5.0|This is a much loved series in our home, I am looking forward to getting the rest of the series.
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|If you are trying to run this on the fire there is a different version and its three bucks but its HD and worth it.  Enjoy seeing your favourite birds use the force!
B008673ZAQ|3.0|Enjoyable read but a bit crude at times.  Fifty Shades was better, but I'll still read the next book in the series.
0439023491|4.0|Suzanne Collins has done it again; after writing her smash-hit novel The Hunger Games, she's released the second book of the trilogy, Catching Fire.  Hundreds of thousands of Hunger Games enthusiasts have rushed to the second book after finishing the first, in hopes for more of the life of Katniss Everdeen.  After the intensity and enthrall the Hunger Games held, I didn't think the second book would impress me nearly as much as the first.  After reading it, I felt that I was right; the second book was wonderful, but it seemed tremendously more slow paced, less intense, and I found myself simply rushing through some parts that seemed lacking.  Overall, a good read, but don't expect the same kind of intensity as The Hunger Games.<br /> After surviving the Hunger Games, Katniss and Peeta return to District 12 in a blaze of glory, being the first District 12 victors in years.  Katniss finds Peeta avoiding her after revealing that she was simply pretending to love him, and Gale seems to be holding her at a distance as well.  She doesn't have much time to worry about this though, because she and Peeta have to work together again on the Victory Tour, and pretend they're star-crossed lovers as they visit each of the 12 Districts to convince everyone that they weren't trying to undermine the Capitol, especially President Snow.  But things take a horrible turn as the 75th Hunger Games arrive, and with them the Quarter Quell, which will turn the lives of Katniss and Peeta upside down.  At the same time, tiny sparks of an uprising are beginning to catch, and even though Katniss unintentionally helped create them, she doesn't truly know if she should try to stop them.  Katniss has to figure out how to outwit the Capitol yet again in a game of life and death, but this time, if she makes so much as one mistake, everyone she loves could be hurt.<br /> When I was reading Catching Fire, I was reminded of The Giver.  Both novels take place in a futuristic society that it extremely different from society today.  Both novels are also under the rule of an extremely strict government that is trying to deprive its people of something (In Catching Fire, there's no freedom, in The Giver, no one really has any of their own emotions).  The Games aspect of the book reminded me strongly of a manga, Mirai Nikki (which means Future Diary), in which 12 people are competing against each other to become God.  They all have to try to kill off other diary owners and stay alive, and the last person left alive becomes God.  Slightly similar to how 12 Districts are fighting against each other, and the last person alive gets a great deal of glory and riches to live off of, is it not?<br /> The reason that I didn't find Catching Fire nearly as good as The Hunger Games was because of the difference in the pacing of both books.  In The Hunger Games, everything seems so much more fast-paced, and the novel progressed with a sort of momentum, similar to that of a train.  Overall, everything seemed more detailed and more exciting.  However, when it comes to Catching Fire, the metaphorical train seems to slam into a wall.  During about the first half of the book, everything that happened seemed to lack extensive detail and to me just seemed incredibly boring.  When Suzanne Collins told her readers about Katniss reuniting with Gale for the first time since the Games, I was expecting a much more detailed scene than \\"...my mother said \\"Your cousins can hardly wait to see you!\\" Then I turned and saw Gale and Hazelle and all the kids waiting for me, so what could I do but go along?\\" Collins could have definitely made that more descriptive and more than two sentences long.  Up until about the Quarter Quell, I found myself reading simply to get through the book, and I kept thinking to myself, \\"When is something exciting going to happen?\\"  I just felt that too few events in the novel were given the attention and detail they deserved, and were written off to be more minor things.<br/> Catching Fire also seemed to be lacking in detail on the characters.  It didn't seem like any new information about the main characters was revealed, and some important characters seemed to be missing from a great deal of the story.  Many new characters were introduced because of the Games aspect of this novel, but it didn't seem like many of them were heavily detailed, aside from appearance.  For example, when Collins describes Katniss' first meeting with Finnick, she describes his appearance to be \\"Tall, athletic, with golden skin and bronze-colored hair and those incredible eyes.\\"  She also brings up how he won the games, and that he was loved by many girls in the Capitol, but to me it doesn't feel like she's trying to show the readers his depth as a person.  If a reader were to read on into Mockingjay, the third book of The Hunger Games trilogy, they would find that there's much more to Finnick than his appearance and the fact that girls adore him.  All the details about a character don't need to be presented immediately or directly, but it seems a bit much to stretch the description of a character and their personality into a whole other book.<br /> In some instances, it's easy to say who should or shouldn't read a book, based on things like genre, content, theme, etc.  However, that's not so with any of the books in The Hunger Games trilogy.  Due to the fact that the books are more or less based off of an annual event in which 24 children attempt to kill each other, I would say any of the books in the trilogy should only be read by people age 11 and up.  However, that's about as specific as you can get when recommending or advising against reading this novel, or any in the trilogy.  The trilogy is seemingly filled with role reversals and contradictions of what most people consider normal.  The narrator of the novels is a girl, but the way she thinks and acts is much more masculine than feminine.  Stylists and fashion appear often, yet so do weapons.  Katniss is female, yet loves to hunt and trap, while Peeta is male, and has a passion for baking.  You can't truly say a certain type of person should read the books, because they're so diverse and multifaceted.<br /> When it comes down to the wire, this book is not the best in the world.  However, it's far from the worst in the world.  Parts of it seemed immensely dull, completely lacking, and just boring. Yet at the same time, there were parts of the novel that were just as gripping, intense, and wonderful as I found myself hoping for.  When it comes to trilogies, the first novel is always when readers are introduced to a whole new world of possibilities, and the last is when many readers wish wistfully for more after reading an epic finale.  The middle novel is neither the end nor the beginning, simply the time between.  Authors can try to write the middle novel so it turns out to be as fantastic as the beginning and the end, or they can choose not to put in as much effort and turn out something less than satisfactory.  While Collins didn't write the novel in a way that exceeded expectations (Or mine, at least), she did manage to create a lovely piece of literature that held some of the same exceptional qualities as the first novel of the trilogy.  Suzanne Collins, I applaud you on your work in this second novel, and hope that the rest of your ever-faithful supporters will, too./> Catching Fire also seemed to be lacking in detail on the characters.

B002LFAHBO|5.0|This movie was always in my head but after watching it again this Christmas season, it is now a standard that will find its way into my list of movies to watch at Christmas (or anytime I need a lift).  Marvelously done, wonderful stories filled with all the angst and joy love brings us everyday!!

B00127RAJY|4.0|Jillian does not disappoint. I'd heard about the 30 day shred for years, and I finally got it. I workout otherwise, so I don't do this multiple times a week, but when I do, it's always a good workout. It's only 20 minutes, but you never stop moving. I've only made it through the first level so far... looking forward to the next challenge!

B009X01ELC|4.0|I have been researching cases since I got my Kindle Fire 8.9 back in November.  All the cases I looked at didn't seem to grab my attention. This case was not my first choice. I was actually looking at a slimmer one. The customer reviews were my deciding factor.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Auto On/Off with the close of the cover<br />Extra padding around the Kindle<br />Very secure in the holder<br />Case rotates vertical and horizontal<br />Elastic strap keeps case closed<br />Multiple slots for multiple viewing angles in both horizontal and veritical<br /><br />Con:<br />Case is very big and bulky<br /><br />Overview:<br />The case is big and bulky making it uncomfortable to read in bed. But with all the pros I listed above, I can live with it. This is a very good case. It provides plenty of protection for my Kindle Fire, which is the only reason why I need a case. I reccommed this case to anybody looking for one.

B007SYWFRM|4.0|This game is highly addictive. It compares to Farmville or the other games you might play on Facebook. I enjoy it and I am sure others will too. I did put a little money toward it for acorns but if you play it everyday you don't really even need to spend money on it.
B0083P1QUM|3.0|&#34;Bone Bed&#34;  though I have not finished this book, don't feel it is up to Cornwell standards.<br />Too much description in the first chapters about retreiving the body from under water.

B008I34Z8E|5.0|I was experimenting with all sorts of life forms back then...Zappa had me taped! Well done Frank it's not just me! There were better albums from Zappa during this era e.g. 'Them or Us', but Waka is one of a kind, as they all are.
B00APUQT7I|3.0|Enjoyed the actors' - they did a great job and the animation was fabulous as usual. I think it is geared of course, for younger audiences - the story was just not quite there, perhaps it was just too trite in places for my taste.
B0026IPAJA|4.0|The story is wonderful and so is the music.  Big thumbs up!  My son loves this movie and so do I.
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|Nice game... easy to play Android quite Refreshing... i recomend you to download it as soon as possible in order to enjoy ir as myself

1451695195|5.0|Thank you Dr. Alexander for your beatiful book. My son and I heard your interview on Denis Prager and were very taken aback. I read the book in one sitting. It moved us both, something we maybe intuitively understand or know. It helps our family keep faith and keep our vision of what is important in our lives right here and now.
B004O4K4SQ|5.0|this is just plain old fashioned alien blasting fun. upgrade weapons, dodge asteroids, whitty banter, cool mellow soundtrack. graphics are just where they should be and is nothing special, but it's charming and not the point anyways. enjoy this addictivEly frustrating and fun game.

B006LSZECO|5.0|This is a great story.  Interesting and a bit disturbing but very good.  I highly recommend this story if you are looking for a something a little dark.
B007M45PMU|5.0|Of course ho hey is great but the rest of the album is just as good. an instant addition to the regular rotation...in fact it's been on constant replay since getting it....also create a lumineers station on Pandora and find more great music. A++

B005V2EVBQ|5.0|This is my second case.  The first one is simply getting a bit shabby looking after a year of constant use.  The case holds the Kindle Fire securely without interfering with the device itself.  It's light-weight and isn't bulky.  A little disappointed that there aren't more color choices, but other than that, it's a great choice.
B0063IH60K|1.0|Game okay but detest the pop-up ads. This is worrisome and a real annoyance.  Will look for game without ads!!
0451232852|5.0|Very very good read, factual but woven into a novel.  Why  is the sequel not available in Australia as a paperback?
B00867GJYK|5.0|Who doesn't love this movie?!  My husband and I were impatiently for this to be re-released and I pre-ordered it months before the release date, and couldn't be happier!  Great family movie for everyone!
B0074VTHKM|5.0|I read this with my grandchildren in mind.  Now they are reading it also.  Good book for older olders (10 and up).
0756405890|5.0|Rarely do I get to read a book that draws you into another world like this one does, and I read a LOT of sci fi fantasy.  I figure, if you're going to read, you should escape into something!<br /><br />I picked this book on a whim and read it and it stuck with me.  It really did.  The story is excellent, the characters develop over time, and Kvothe is the only red headed man you'd want to marry (okay and Jamie from the Outlander series.  fine.  Him too.)<br /><br />The story unfolds over 3 days, I've now read the first 2.  It's killing me.  We need a few decades with Kvothe and his magic and music and great stories.  Make a nice long HBO special, por favor!<br /><br />FYI, the next book was really great too.<br /><br />Other books that have made me very happy in the past few years: the game of thrones series by GRRM, Naomi Novik's Temeraire series, and the oldest living vampire series by Rod Redux.  All terrific, all worlds you can escape to when you need a break from toddlers and/or excel zombie-hood.

B00AHSMDQY|2.0|I like Christian Bale but this movie is too long and boring. We had to watch it for two days and thought it was waste of time.

B0091REZMW|4.0|I love these kinds of games, the graphics were really good, the game is challenging, the scenes are very cool, the tricks to get some of the hidden objects were witty' but i enjoyed it !! a lot, i play a lot of these types of games and i cant stop till im at least halfway through,addicting for sure, good luck and enjoy - it seems all the g5 games are this way, stunning and hypnotic.. i will play them all !!
B000SVZIGC|4.0|The animation, voice acting, story are all very well done.  But it's the music and songs that seal the deal for me.  Excellent music!
B0050DZN4K|5.0|I've been using Feedly for a long time. So long, it's second nature. Looks amazing on every device/computer I've. tried it on.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|My two teenagers and I enjoyed it but it was predictable....so no surprises at the end. That is why I did not gave her 5 stars.
034580404X|3.0|its an ok story but i feel its too long maybe for me, i am not a big reader.  others i know read right through it.

B000QRIGLC|5.0|A friend of mine, half jokingly I think, said to me why don't you read a true story rather than your normal vampire, werewolves,  witches and ghosts.  He recommended this one to me, saying this was one of 2 that he really enjoyed and has read a few times.  so I read the sample, not really expecting to like it,  and found that I really did, so I bought the book and that night read 6 chapters of it.<br /><br />Today I took the book planning to read a chapter or 2 and finished the book, I just couldn't put it down.<br /><br />I believe this book will stay with me for a while. I loved reading everything that he wrote, I never felt bored, there were a few times where I had tear filled eyes and was wishing that was not what those men really endured.  I sat here thinking WOW I don't  know how they did it and how there are people still doing it.<br /><br />I send thanks to the man who suggested this book to me, because I enjoyed every minute of it and understand things better.  Kudos to the team and to Marcus, thank you for sharing your story and serving, as well to all that serve.
B004WR125O|5.0|I have just odered the 809 (got it for $450.00, also a great price)  that was on sale at a great price and I also ordered this item at $19.00 which I guess is a good price. I have not got it yet and when it arrives I will use to update my 809 if needed and to use it to stream radio off the internet. Reviews are all over the place on this item... sure hope it works for me so I can make my life a lot more simple. I will post any problems, but will appreciate any input on what will make this item work to its full potential. Thanks in advance for any help....Fred<br /><br />NOTE: I just received this item (1/8/13) and it clearly states in instruction book: To be used on Onkyo xxx09 only. If folks are trying to use on other systems they sure may not work. I will install it tomorrow and if I encounter any problems I will make additional comments.....<br /><br />UPDate...1/9/2012... I just got finished setting my 809 and the UWF-1 Wireless adapter all set up. I have a $29.00 Walmart CISCO Modem which is about 25 feet from the 809 and I get 74%, which I am really satisified with after seeing other posts on here. I couldn't use the remote to set it up though. I did it off the front of the unit after several tries using the remote. Once I got it right,,, about 45 min it came right up and showed all the internet stations avail. I am very satisified so far, but haven't used it really yet. My set came with all the updates already installed so I didn't use it to update. After I get used to the UWF I will repost if I find any problems....<br />1/16/12 This worked flawlessly since I installed it. Seems very steady and never a hiccup....
B00AMBH70S|4.0|My husband was interested in this movie from the moment it was out in theaters.  It took a while to develop the plot but once it did it was exciting.
B00867GHS8|5.0|I love this movie and the 3D affect are AMAZING! I recommend this movie for any Disney lover out there!
B002QE3CTY|5.0|Wow, wow, wow, wow. Read this book! I am completely speechless. This was an amazing book. Anyone, anyone! Should read this book.
B0016Q6CQI|5.0|Buying the whole album wasn't what I had in mind but it ended up being fine that I spent that $10.  Loved the episode and love this music!
B00ADYYBFI|5.0|If you are a fan of the show and looking to relive the moments then this soundtrack is for you. All very professionally recorded in studio quality. Its not audio from the show as I have found a few times when downloading from a TV series. Actually real cool to be able to hear the entire songs since the show walks all over it when viewing!
B007SGM084|1.0|Very boring story line. It is like one very, very long twisted date. Doesn't live up to the hype. I bought the trilogy and I had to force myself to finish them.
B009K0P10K|4.0|It's good but not as good as the first season. Seems like they had to really work at getting the story to stretch for another year.
B0063IH60K|4.0|this is a fun app. there are ads between games but you can skip them right away. works very smooth and i seem to win fairly often.
B005CRQ4OW|5.0|I like how it talks about like real things going on in middle school like popularity and rumors it shows real stuff happening in real life
B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|This book illustrates the love that adults should feel for one another!! It's a true love story that has no boundaries.
B008TT7CXW|4.0|Really  like this product and I'ld recommend it to anyone ho need to carry more than one micro SD Card at time.
B004LROUNG|4.0|I love your books.  Since reading my first John Grisham book, I have been hooked. I love the characters in all your books.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|So dramatic (but in a good way). Holder is the perfect guy to have in your life, even though it doesn't seem that way in the beginning. I even thought he was a butt-head in the beginning. But when you dig into the story more, you fall in love with these two characters. Sky is so brave but she shows that its okay to be weak in your life when hard times are placed in our hands.<br /><br />The drama in this book is big. So if your a drama freak, you should really read this book. Or if you find yourself watching lifetime movies, you should DIFFIDENTLY read this book. Its not as scary as a lifetime movie but towards the end it is exactly like a lifetime movie.<br /><br />Colleen Hoover is one of my favorite authors now. Her story plot is very well written. She leads the reader guessing something will happen but then totally changes your mind with something else that happens along the way. Sometimes you can guess what will happen at the end, but in this book... you cannot predict a thing. That's how good the author is. READ IT!!!!!!!!!!
B0017I1FNK|5.0|Emmylou  brings back memories of yesterday.  She slows down the world for you with her beautiful voice and the harmonies are soft.
B003WUYRGI|1.0|I liked this dictionary because it had a lot of words that I didn't know even my little brother liked it it is very very helpful :) and plus I love dictionaries because I love to spell spelling is my life
B0055XCDZ2|5.0|Elizabeth Taylor at her best as Martha. An alcoholic housewife who is mad at the world. Her consolation prize is humiliating her husband in front of her guest. With all the drama that followed Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton, we forget what great actors they were. You feel their passion, the madness of a couple who fell on love with each other but couldn't live to their expectations and blame each other for their failures.
B0042MEQVG|5.0|Love all the twilight movies, just wanted to add this to my collection. Got it in record time and it was as discribed./
B000IYU9HW|3.0|I saw this picture when it first came out about 40 years ago. It is more like a &#34;B&#34; rated movie to me and more of a &#34;chick flick&#34; than I remembered. However, the story line is good.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book was an amazing read, it made me laugh out loud and cry. The characters are both such interesting and good people that you want to know them or even be them.<br /><br />Yes, it is a book about cancer and yes I did cry because some parts were unbearably sad, but the sad parts did not make it an overall sad book.<br /><br />If you are considering reading it but are not sure if you want to or not I say read it. Purchase it now and start reading as soon as possible.<br /><br />Truly, a life-changing book.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|we have only see disc 1 so far, but looks and sounds great so far.<br />a classic that must be owned.
B00003CXE6|1.0|I clicked on DVD, it brought me here, I was tired didn't pay attention and got the VHS, no one watches VHS why would they put gladiator on VHS? best movie ever but craziest thing ever.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|Game of thrones is sooo good.  I have read all the books and they are amazing.  It's nice to be able to watch the series without having to pay for HBO every month.
B007MU85D0|5.0|Definitely something different. Love the chemistry of the band, excellent lyrics and rhythm. Looking forward to seeing where this band goes.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Easy, fun, and free. Takes boring down times and makes them bearable.<br />What more do you want from a game?
B008NEMN0K|4.0|Bought for my grandson (in 20's) who really like sit.
B0006Z2KXE|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies of all time. Hepburn is charming in her typical vulnerable woman with a tough exterior role, Grant is hilarious, and Stewart is sweet.
B000002MY3|5.0|I love this album. I have owned it several times. Lost my last copy so I bought it used (very cheap). No skips or scratches. Delivered quick. It does not say it on the CD but there is a track 13 and after that song there is a minute of silence and then there is the best song on the CD!!
B004ZWKWQQ|5.0|You would have thought my son won the lottery when he opened it on Christmas morning. He didn't go to sleep until he put it together
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|Good movie for the kids and adults. I would recommend this movie. It was not that long,but it kept the kids attention the whole movie.
B0017SWPXY|3.0|It plays too much on the racing care sport and not enough on the story of a dog and his family.  Still, the dog's eye view was entertaining
B00846REIS|4.0|Better than fifty shades of grey!!!! Very romantic!! would definitely read it again!! Great love story. Anxious to read the next book.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I loved this game kept me thinking constantly. The special effects were pretty cool.  Well worth every penny. Enjoyed it immensely! Can't wait for the next one.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I couldn't stop reading this book. Definitely worth reading. The author took me to the Hunger Games and its like I was there
B005LAII9O|5.0|What can I say; Blake Lively looking great, Benicio is a wicked villain, I won't think of a gardening crew as just there to mow, blow, and go again.
B00A6X9Z8E|5.0|She is a joy to listen to and excerise to. All of her great hits on one CD. Hope Chapter Two comes out soon.
B0092SPYQG|5.0|I listened through the whole album and had some major head bobbing going. The lyrics are awesome and the beats are great it flowed smoothly. Ive always been a Papa Roach fan but I love how they are evolving and lots of bands have pretty much the same beat or something close to it through the whole album, its not a bad thing its what makes you go oh thats this band because you recognize their sound but with this album I was like is that Papa Roach or did All That Remains come on. Im not comparing them they have a very different sound but i purchased the two together so i put them back to back and there was one really cool heavy song that I had to look to see who it was. Definetly a good album, just the first run through I knew it was going to my faves playlist and its rare that an entire album goes in there. Its different but damn good. I love it and worth more than five bucks.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This was the best series that I have read. I also like the Percy Jackson books too. I LOVE them
B007TNS6JI|4.0|THE FUNDAMENTALS OF THE Gameplay are right on , the levels are addictive and skill is used to successfully complete levels. ONLY BAD THING IS THAT THE MULTIPLAYER DOESN'T WORK.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|This game was great it sucked me right in. I would definitely recommend people to play. I love  the mystery it makes you want to play part two
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|My brother had the books so I figure I try it. I must say it was definitely a good read. I look forward to the rest of the series.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|it all works and fast! no problems with news feed as others have reported . kindle fire and Facebook are good together.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|I love all of Rick  Riordans books,because I love books with adventure.I love the suspension hanging off every chapter,making you thirst 4 more.I like books that never get boring,ones that always keep in action.I want a book that makes me struggle 2 put it down.The Lost Hero is all that and more.If Harry Potter was good,they need 2 make another word 2 describe this book!
B004H4XDBI|4.0|thought it was different, being written from a different point of view. i would recommend it. it is an easy read
B009LL4LMM|4.0|My eight year old likes this app. I have not played it but she wants me to add it to all devices.
B00AIQP9DE|3.0|EDIT. There is a problem with this game at the gate which takes the 5 masks to open. It plays a cut scene then my tablet goes completely black and seems to freeze up but the music is still playing. I have uninstalled the game and re-installed it and it plays fine up until that point and does the same thing again. I have uninstalled it and given it 3 stars until they resolve the issue<br />Games is very fun to play. Well worth your time to download. Very good variety of puzzles. Not overly hard but not too easy. Great job with this one!
B0076DELIG|5.0|Love Harry! The plot to solve the murder is complex and unravels slowly. I also love the growing relationship he has with his daughter.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Perfect everything! From sad moments to victories, all of \\"Auggie-Doggies\\" experiences have been heart-breaking and joyful. I recommend this book to all readers-from 8 year olds to 100 year olds! Perfect read!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|However, it's a great game, really good graphics, good hints.  I had trouble putting it down and would recommend it highly.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|Great price for a great game!!  Wonderful time killer.  Do not need internet connection to play, which is fabulous!!  Have fun!
B007SGM084|4.0|Very steamy. Could not stop reading. Fell in love with Ana and Christian. Glad the third book had a happy ending and they had babies. Very good and a addictive series.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|hehehe..this game is fun!! some weird dragons.... im like wow amazing!! im not that addicted but yeah good app.... and fun game....:)) try it!!
B0053TMP24|5.0|This book was amazing just like all of Mr.Riordan's books it just hooks you and makes you want more,I loved it.<br />p.s<br />I can't wait to read the Mark of Athena!!!!!!!<br />Vic
B009HELT3C|4.0|Josh Brolin is very believable as a young Tommie Lee Jones; and there's a twist or two in here I didn't see coming.  Very enjoyable.  Will Smith is as entertaining as ever.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|I read this book when I was in high school and rereading it brought back nice memories. I read it again after watching the movie, which did not do justice for the stage musical.
0545265355|5.0|My son loved reading them. I only read the first one before going to the movie and I loved it. Defenitely going to read the seond and third books too!
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I enjoyed the game a lot but felt slightly deceived. The app was suppose free but before ended up having to buy it before I could finish it. It is worth the 2.99. I would have liked it more if they had been upfront about needing to purchase it.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|GREAT APP DOES WHAT IT MEANT TO DO. JUST WHAT MY KINDLE HD NEEDED. SUPER EASY TO USE. BEST CALCULATOR SO FAR.
B009KHBDUU|1.0|I guess if you're in love with Johnny Depp, or Tim Burton, then watching this movie all the way through will satisfy your jones for them.  I fell asleep after 20 minutes; the rest of the family watched the whole movie but told me later they wished they had just turned it off.
B005T87QCI|3.0|Real steel is awesome best game ever, but no Adam or Zeus. They are the main characters!! What's with that
B005OCFGTO|5.0|Great series, great qualitiy. We watched them over and over again with the entire family and they never get old!
B007TNS6JI|4.0|This isn't a bad game I really enjoyed playing this.I was afraid to get it because I thought it was bad but I'm glad I wrong this is indeed a great game for the kindle.
B00APUYWYA|1.0|A totally unbelievable plot. Obsequious naughtiness. Characters couldn't be found in real life anywhere. I wouldn't watch this with someone else's eyes.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This book was extremely good and a quick read and left me craving more. I can't wait til the next one comes out
B0091REZMW|5.0|I love it the first few comments are complaining about paying for diamonds I didn't pay for a penny for this game and you have to wait for your energy to restore not a big deal I just wait and do something else I'm at level 11 almost at level twelve I am having so much fun with my game and with the diamonds situation to get coffee is six diamonds and if you run out you can just level up and get more love love love this game.
B0001ARCFA|5.0|The sound is amazing, nice, and crisp. I use these to listen to music and play games. I would like to note that the bass isnt as loud as i would like but even that doesnt compromise how much I like them. When playing games I can hear everything, and dont even get me started on lossless music, its like orgasms are raining into my ears and did i mention comfort? They are the most comfortable earphones I have ever had!@!@! They fit right on my fat head and big ears but dont squeeze too hard and the fact that they are semi open *or whatever its called* lets me hear things that are going on around me, like someone calling me, timers, etc. All in all 5 stars, great buy for those who enjoy music and gaming.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book was amazing!!!!!<br /><br />I think all of my friends would enjoy this book just as much as I do.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Game works great, has nice personalization options  but their is too<br /> many advertisements if<br />they could get rid of some that would make it much better to play.
B009TO99TG|5.0|Great Buy On Some Excellent Music. I never got into Coldplay until Viva La Vida came out. Even then, I never made the plunge until this Christmas when someone gave me Mylo Xyloto. After one listen, I wanted the rest of their catalog. I was really pleased when I found this box set of these 4 albums on Amazon.com. Whatta find! Thanks Amazon. Thanks Coldplay! Get 'em while they're hot! I don't expect Coldplay or Amazon.com to have this special offer, available only through them, around for long!
B007IXWKUK|3.0|It was an book and a slower read.  I really enjoyed it a great deal though.  I like the author's writing style.
B0024FADAQ|5.0|\\"Greetings starfighter. You have been recruited by the Star League to defend the Frontier against Xur and the Kodan armada. Get ready. Prepare for blastoff.\\"<br />Ah-ha! I knew it! All these video games are designed and built by aliens for the purpose of recruiting our kids for war in outer space. Video games are not really games, they are tests sent out across the universe to find those with the gift to be starfighters.<br />Teenager Alex Rogan (Lance Guest) is spirited away to the planet Rylos to join an elite team of starfighters prepping for war. Alex has the gift to be a great starfighter, they say, and in a gunstar ship he'll come through like a champ.<br />What a spot for him to be in. He's just a kid from a trailer park.
B0071CNGI8|5.0|I seen the movie first but the book makes it seem more real it holds your interest I had a hard time putting down I would recommend it to everyone great book
B0098TGV20|4.0|This is a copy-and-paste of a review I posted on Steve Hoffman.  Sorry to Hoffmanites if you came here and realized you'd read this already:<br /><br />Okay, well I've had this thing since Christmas, as I was given it as a present. I listened to it on a fairly bad stereo down in Florida, and only this week got to listen to it on my own rig. I'll agree with the general assessment. It's a mixed bag. The album covers are very inconsistent: as others have pointed out, \\"My Generation\\" is glossy and precise, while most of the rest are matte finish, like the Stones box set, and the cover reproductions are often washed out and cheap looking, like a bad scan. This is particularly the case with \\"A Quick One,\\" \\"The Who Sell Out,\\" \\"Who Are You,\\" \\"Face Dances,\\" and \\"It's Hard.\\" The whole thing is based on the UK releases, so little things I thought were errors--like the bright yellow lettering on the front of \\"Who Are You\\" or the fact that Record 1 of \\"Quadrophenia\\" has Side 1 and Side 2, rather than Side 1 and Side 4--are actually in line with the original UK releases. (The US \\"Quad\\" was configured like \\"Tommy,\\" with Sides 1 and 2 on record 1, and 2 and 3 on record 2.) The \\"Quadrophenia\\" cover finish is the same as on the 2011 Geffen reissue, though the mix is better on this. The inner sleeves are just paper, with no clear rice lining, unless the sleeve is particular to the release, and then it's heavy cardboard. The \\"Tommy\\" cover looks great, with one weird thing: both albums are housed on the far right panel, whereas in all the old Decca/MCA copies I've had, record one went in the left panel, record 2 in the right, with the booklet slit under the middle panel. Maybe this was how the old UK album cover was designed: couldn't determine this on Discogs. Then again, this design makes sense, as the two heavy records on either side tended to result in a tearing of the binding. I've seen that happen with old copies of \\"Tommy.\\" So no complaints here.<br /><br />The sound. The early records are all great, all the way up to \\"Tommy.\\" I have an old Decca copy of this one, and my record 2 sounds thin and shrill, whereas this one is warm and detailed. Conversely, side 1 of my old Decca has more bottom than the one in the box. Not sure if my old Decca is an anomaly: I've heard that in most early copies, the two records would have been cut at different plants, so that's probably what happened here. But overall \\"Tommy\\" is a lovely listening experience. And to have it in this lovely cover, with the heavy 180g vinyl and black Track labels, is the biggest thrill this box had to offer me. And it's a big thrill. I love this copy of \\"Tommy.\\" Love it.<br /><br />\\"Who's Next\\" is also fantastic. I think this one was sourced from the Japanese SACD and it sounds like it was. (In fact, this is apparently also the case with \\"Sell Out\\" and \\"Quad.\\") The piano on \\"Getting In Tune\\" sounds like it's in the room with you, and the vocals are real and human throughout. Great bottom.<br /><br />\\"Quad\\" is great, for the most part, with, as one of the earlier posters remarked, more treble. In many cases, this clarifies the notoriously muddy mix, particularly on \\"The Punk Meets the Godfather,\\" \\"I've Had Enough,\\" and \\"Bell Boy.\\" But you don't get the bounce and warmth of the old version. My old copy is a Track/MCA, very early pressing, and hard to beat, and this one comes close. One place where my old copy wins hands down is \\"Love Reigh O'er Me.\\" Here the trebly mix results in a somewhat dry and brittle sound, which is troubling in a song already so overloaded with overdubs and the rest.<br /><br />\\"By Numbers\\" is the first real disappointment. Here the tendency toward a dryer, more \\"wooden\\" sound results in an inferior sound to my old MCA copy. In many cases, the box set version sounds more detailed and realistic. This is especially the case on \\"However Much I Booze\\" and \\"Success Story.\\" At other times, it just lacks warmth and dynamism, particularly on \\"Slip Kid\\" and \\"DreamingFrom the Waist.\\"<br /><br />\\"Who Are You\\": unfortunately, side 1 of my copy seems to be off center. But the sound is comparable, and at times superior, to my old MCA early pressing. \\"Guitar and Pen\\" is the stand out here. I did an intense A/B with this track, and the box set version won in terms of detail and dynamic range.<br /><br />\\"Face Dances\\": This one's a dud. My original copy is a promo/1st pressing, and it squashes this one like grapes. Somehow, this new one is both muddy and brittle. On \\"Another Tricky Day,\\" Entwistle's bass is massive, which is exciting, but when I played my old Warner Brothers copy I realized that the loud, booming bass on the new version masks all the detail, especially the acoustic guitar and the piano. On the new \\"You Better You Bet\\" Daltrey sounds submerged, and the drums sound like biscuit tins, to use Entwistle's old simile for the drum sound on \\"Tommy.\\"<br /><br />\\"It's Hard\\": This one's a draw with my Warner Brothers vinyl copy.<br /><br />Haven't listened to \\"Endless Wire.\\" Like everyone else, I would have traded this for \\"Meaty Beaty Big and Bouncy\\" and \\"Odds and Sods.\\"<br /><br />The A/B business gave me a headache, I must admit: so much easier to do with a CD! After awhile, it's like blind tasting Coke vs Pepsi: you forget which one you liked and which one you were comparing the other one to. \\"Quad\\" was the most confusing: the new one has many virtues, and sounds great on its own; the stereo imaging is startling in its 3-D effects, and the individual instruments come through crystal clear. But when I played my 1973 copy, I heard this buttery warmth that I didn't realize was missing from the other. And then I played the box set version again and wondered if I was over estimating that warmth. And back again. But \\"Love Reign O'er Me\\" definitely suffers in the new version. I liked it fine when I played it by itself; after the A/B, I feel like I've just discovered a troubling detail about an old friend. I was better off before I knew it!<br /><br />So, to buy or not to buy? My Who albums are all pretty good, but the old ones are old, no getting around it. So for everything up to \\"Who's Next,\\" I'd say these new copies are my go-to. \\"Quad\\" is nearly perfect, but confess I also prefer the old US packaging. The remaining 4 are redundant to what I already have, with the possible exception of the new \\"Who Are You,\\" which is tarnished by the off-center pressing. That might not be a problem in your copy, if you buy the box. So, as this was a gift, I'm perfectly happy with it, and will continue to enjoy the records in here that are winners. Had I shelled out my own hard-earned, I think I'd be slightly disappointed, particularly as I only really need half the set. Here's another way to look at it, though: if you buy it now, and feel the same way I do (that is, you're happy with everything up to \\"Who's Next\\" or \\"Quad\\" but not sure you needed the rest), just remember that having it in your collection is better than wishing you had it 10 years from now!<br /><br />Anyway, hope this helps.From the Waist.\\"<br /><br />\\"Who Are You\\": unfortunately, side 1 of my copy seems to be off center.

B003ZJ0ZX0|5.0|I can't objectively talk about any of his work as I do believe this guy will be THE next big thing in music and be around for a long time to come! Well crafted pop with a voice of gold! If I said any more it would sound like a gushing girl. This is another fine example of a pop genius at work. It looks as if every thing Bruno Mars touches will turn to gold! I'd rate this fine offering higher if I could. Buy and Enjoy.

This story all begins on an island, and no one else seems to live there but the people involved.<br /><br />Suzy, played by Kara Howard lives with her family on this island. She seems to be the 'difficult' one in the family. On the same island is a Boy Scout camp, where Sam, played by Jared Gilman, an orphan, also seems to be the odd man out.  No one seems to like him, and strangely he and Suzy met last summer and have planned a rendezvous to run away together. This sets the wheels in motion for an adolescence hunt by some very strange people.  Bill Murray plays Suzy's father, and Frances McDormand plays her mother. Any film with McDormand amd Murray is sure to be a great one. We also have Bruce Willis playing the Island Policeman, Scoutman Ward payed by Ed Norton, and SocialServices played by Tilda Swinton. All these characters lead to an often time humorous film that deals with the turmoil of adolescence, the goodness of scouting, and the trials and tribulations of life.<br /><br />This film is all played with straight faces, none for laughs, and the children are as superb as the adults. Wes Anderson has put together a film for us all, shining examples of life as we remember it.<br /><br />Recommended.  prisrob 01-05-13<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0032GY2KS Scrooged]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B001G7HKZ4 Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day]]
B0044JVM00|5.0|I've been a huge fan of the Alan Parsons Project since I was a teenager, and &#34;I Robot&#34; was the album (See? I said &#34;album&#34;) that got me started. The only album of their's that I like better is &#34;Tales of Mystery and Imagination.&#34; This is some of progressive rock's best stuff. Give a listen. You won't be disappointed.
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|Don't ask me why but, I have the feeling that Bruno IS the next big thing in Music and thankfully is here to stay.  Not a bad cut on the thing and well worth the price! I can't say enough about this CD with out gushing so I'll just listen and enjoy and hopefully<br />you'll do the same. I now have everything I can find by Bruno Mars. Great pipes, good vibe and takes me to heaven every play!
0316226424|5.0|It was a very nice book and a good read.  I really enjoyed it a great deal.  I like the author's writing style.  It was a wonderful sexy story!

B005LAII3U|5.0|ONE OF MY FAVORITES MOVIES ... DIFFERENT THAN THE ORIGINAL BUT BETTER THAN THE ORIGINAL ... FIVE STARS FOR THIS MOVIE.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Great book. Couldn't read it fast enough and didn't want to put it down and I'm not usually a book reader. Would read it again.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|what great book I enjoyed every page of it. It touched my heart .i have recommend it to my sister hope she enjoys it as well.
0756407125|5.0|Tops the charts on fantasy writing.  I enjoyed this book as much as when I started reading George R. R. Martin.
B0054R6BFM|5.0|This book was incredibly touching. The inspiration and the sadness were perfectly blended into an amazingly realistic tale. The whole story happens in the course of two days, which is very hard to believe but still very well-written, and refers back to memories that Hannah Baker had in the past. This story isn't just a teen read, but a book for all adults, young or not.
B003THJA1G|5.0|I love the chemistry and uniqueness of Castle. The story lines are interesting and there is a good balance or humor and drama.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Grandchildren had lots of fun with it - they already knew how to play. 3 grandsons - all loved playing.
0553582453|4.0|Although I preferred the Tawnie Man series of books more, Robin Hobb does a great job with this second series as well.
B000G6R7B8|4.0|I wanted a watch that has a clear and easy to read face, with a second hand and it had to glow. I would have preferred to have the 1-12 digits printed on the outer circle rather than the 60 second digits. I also appreciate the day of the week as well as the number day. I do like the color of both the watch face and the band. The band however gets a big ding for being terribly scratchy. I actually had to use a nail file to smooth some particularly bothersome areas. This made it more comfortable, but left it frayed. The scratchy band made me re-position it frequently. I like the brushed stainless steel case; I think it is very attractive and will not show wear. Price was a big factor in choosing this watch as I plan to wear it for work only.
1439170916|4.0|This book tells me that we all have cancer cells in our bodies which can be switched on at any time, so while I was reading it, I worried that subconsciously I might turn my cancer cells on.<br /><br />What I loved about this book is the way it heralds all those un-sung scientists who work tirelessly in their windowless basement laboratories searching for the 'missing link' in the cancer story and I raced to the end - skipping all the administrative stuff about fund-raising which I found boring - to find out - well where are we now? If I get cancer will I be cured? The answer is rather unsettling. It depends what kind of cancer and how virulent the straiin is that you've disturbed. Mukherjee does not try to soften the truth.<br />[[ASIN:0859654796 Freak Out! My Life with Frank Zappa by Pauline Butcher]]
B008M0NDOK|3.0|This controller could eeserve a higher rating if it were also compatible with the iMac or at least more games, Gameloft and other than Gameloft games, but for now it will have to be three stars, even though I wouldn't blame people who give it 2 star ratings...
0553582461|4.0|Although I preferred the Tawnie Man series of books more, Robin Hobb does a great job with this second series as well.
B0000CFW87|5.0|I listen to this CD almost everyday! Josh's voice is so amazing! I had purchased this CD years ago when it was first released, but had misplaced it. When I saw it on amazon.com for such a great prize, I HAD to order it. It was easy to place my order and it arrived quickly.
B008MEM24S|3.0|I was really excited to see we finally got an update..... But when you try to buy the new levels there is an error and you can not get them
1451648537|5.0|This is a highly recommended read even if you actually hate anything to do with Apple!<br /><br />It is quite inspiring!
0553582445|5.0|It is refreshing to find a new series that is unique and fun to read.  Certainly tops the charts with some of the better fantasy writers.
B003O86FMW|4.0|While I'm not a fan of the concept if this series, I found it to be a real page turner. It's very relatable to the present nature if things.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|That was one of the best books I've ever read! I can't wait to read the next book!!! AWESOMELY COOL!!!
B0001I561Y|5.0|Aladdin!! I love it!! My favorite movie of all times! Wish it would be available from iTunes :( Why is it not??
B0000DIXDR|5.0|A timeless classic with Patrick Swayze at the top of his game for the genre character of Johnny.  A must buy.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I'd heard the hype -- and it lives up to it!  Beautiful sets, lovely costumes, compelling storylines and interesting characters.  I'm hooked!

B007TNS6JI|5.0|I love this gamme just wish more classes and it would be nice to be able to other than choose thebclass of course make more customizable character.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|Wall.E is more human than some humans I know!  :)  A delightful story that will appeal to kids of all ages...the timeless theme of mankind's fall and redemption presented without being preachy and in such an entertaining manner that kids can enjoy it but adults will get the message loud and clear.  The animation is over the top!  This is a movie you can watch and re-watch, and re-watch.  One of the more spectacular movies ever made.
B00AJRQLTI|4.0|First, &#34;Do You Hear the People Sing&#34; is in fact apart of the Epilogue track, which is great, because I loved that.<br />The music that is played is excellent - I don't think they missed many major pieces, but you must notice this is a &#34;Highlights&#34; album, not a complete reprisal of the movie's soundtrack.<br />&#34;A Little Fall of Rain&#34; being missing is unfortunate.<br />The only gripe is that they included some tracks which have much more movie and much less music (which follows the &#34;Highlights&#34; concept, but hurts the review). The battle, for example, has more gunshots than words (or at least it seems like that).<br />I for one thoroughly enjoyed every actor's contributions.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Would love a way to look up problems or worries on this app like k could if I had my bible right in front of me. But over all, I love this app
B0007MWZEK|4.0|I am on my third Swivel Sweeper over the last 9 years.  I tried to go without one for a while, but missed the ease of it.  Totally hated using a broom and dustpan.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|Awesome awesome awesome awesome coo<br />Cooba neat game really fun looks great on my nexus and play great too best free game yet
B009KHDT0C|5.0|I didn't know about the Dark Shadows series until this movie came out and my wife told me about it.  She remembered the series from when she was a very young child.  We decided to watch this movie but decided to watch the original series first.  We found it on Netflix.<br />The movie was faithful to the original in all the important ways and was done very well with the benifit of modern directing, special effects, make-up, wardrobe and choice of actors.  The movie is very entertaining from begining to end.  It is worth a watch..
B000NQRE0K|3.0|Do you guys know how violent this movie is? It's just like 3 hours of Mel Gibson slaying dudes.<br />Violently. Explicitly. And without remorse for life or limb or even history.<br /><br />And it is awesome. Kind of a boring Bluray though. I would recommend one with more behind the scenes goodies.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|These are easy games that are great for kids and adults!  I like how more games are unlocked as you play.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|GREAT GAME. GRAPHICS WERE REALLY GOOD. PERFECT MIX OF SEEK AND FIND AND HIDDEN OBJECT. Especially liked the bonus game. DEFINITELY RECOMMEND!
B004ZGI2KK|3.0|The story is good but the dialog is just terrible.  I could swear I saw a pair of tennis shoes on the little girl at the begining of the movie.  Most of the acting was B movie at best.  The special effects weren't much better.  But if you like fairy tales you might enjoy this movie if the above issues don't bother you when watching a movie.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a fun game for all.  I really like to figure out the ones that the girls get stuck on.  This is a game you have to think where to move to not cross another color.  It's very fun.
B006BGZJJ4|4.0|What can you say about a cable.  It works as expected.  It seems to be durable enough. Its a cable.
B00008S2VG|4.0|This is the CD that followed some of Madonna's best work with \\"Ray of Light\\" and \\"Music\\".  When it was released it came out quietly and understated, because that's the kind of album it is.  The music on this is part electronic and part acoustic.  Madonna expresses her distaste about humanity as well as her negative feelings about fame realizing that its quite a hollow feeling.  The title track, \\"American Life\\" is a good song up until she starts rapping towards the end.  I re-edited the song fading it before the rap and now its excellent.  \\"Hollywood\\" has a great mix of guitar and electronic running through it.  \\"I'm so stupid\\" is not quite \\"Ray of Light\\", but listenable.  \\"Nobody Knows Me\\" is a song about the negative side to fame where you are also stuck with the ugliness of humanity.  The music of the song is much better in the version on the EP she released after this [[ASIN:B00122IZES Remixed & Revisited]].<br /><br />The two greatest songs on this album which make this a more than worthy album are \\"Love Profusion\\" and \\"Nothing Fails\\".  Those would have been great tracks to ad onto the \\"Music\\" album which was fantastic, but on the short side.  This album is more of a necessary confessional that she clearly felt she had to get off her chest.  There are songs about her insecurities with herself in \\"X-static Process\\", about the joys of her son in \\"Intervention\\", and then to her need for love after her own Mother died in \\"Mother and Father\\".  Musically this album is not as powerful as her previous two CD's [[ASIN:B00122A28A Ray Of Light (U.S. Version)]] and [[ASIN:B00004X01U Music]], but this is worth a listen for a more restrained Madonna.
B00A0SKFLG|4.0|I would have given this movie 3 stars if it weren't for the female leads in this movie.  I'm a sci-fi fan but this movie was just a bunch of fight sequences tied together with a little dialogue.  I couldn't keep my eyes open toward the end of this movie.
B005HSL626|4.0|This is a fun game.  Sometimes is freezes up...not sure if it's the game or the kindle fire.  It's a lot of fun to slice the fruit and try not to slice the bombs.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Another great Tom Clancy novel.  It pertains to a field in which I work.  I hope this series continues. Great.
B001S6Y0AQ|4.0|The two CD's are outstanding compilations of Brubeck's mastery of jazz.  The DVD was just OK as I expected it to be footage of his trio and him playing in a concert setting.
B002LE6XR2|1.0|Unfortunately the product bought was broken, and the instructions to return it were not clear. This purchase was supposed to be a Christmas present. We will not buy again from this person again.

B004DM0UII|1.0|I cant believe this is a paid app<br />I would give this 0 stars or less. Very suspicious app with poor programming
B005DF2QMC|2.0|not very happy with product received product in a timely manner installed product to computer went to start coverting process and computer will not recognize the player.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|The book had so many twists and unexpected turns that it kept you the turning the pages.  I enjoyed this novel ,it had me laughing and crying and feeling every emotion that the two characters were feeling.
B009NQKPUW|5.0|I liked and really enjoyed Prometheus a lot it was quite different than i exspected it to be. It had a frighting resolve close to the ending and still delievered all the action that you would exspect from this kind of move.
B00A80SHFM|5.0|So being a big fan of Philip Quast when I saw him on the 10th Anniversary on TV when I was in Middle School (and followed his career and had a strong crush which turned into a deep admiration for the man) you'd think someone like me would be bashing and crying that Russel Crowe was horrible.<br />Even after seeing the master at work (Quast) and HATING the 25th anniversary DVD because of that crappy Javert in it, I was thinking \\"Maybe I just have this giant candle for Quast and no other Javert's can take the role up\\"<br />I would write more but why put a giant wall of text saying why you should give this a chance.<br />I just say, give it a chance!
B000F0UV0E|5.0|I saw them in LA when they toured to support this album. Emmylou is unbelievably beautiful in voice and person. Songs were written by her and Knopfler, every one a winner. One of the best CDs in my collection. Great guest musicians, awesome recording quality!
B009UX2YAC|2.0|I liked it until I got to a certain point in the game it restarted its self every time I got off the app.

B0045XICB2|4.0|This is a good saga. I was never really interested in this but decided to give it a chance. I think I got hooked.
B0091REZMW|2.0|this is a fun game but you will need patience or you will be spending alot n<br />of money to speed up the levelling process. or to unlock rooms.
B009E3EYS8|5.0|I am a big Zeppelin fan and watching the DVD brought chills to my spine,<br />after all these years they were still phenomial, outstanding, like they were 30 years ago.<br /><br />I would absolutely recomend this to any Led Zeppelin lover
B0083SBMBM|4.0|This was on the christmas list of a family member. The gift was well received on christmas morning. I was told the person enjoyed the movie.
0525478817|5.0|This is by far one of the best books I have ever read. I must be honest and say that there were several words that I had NEVER heard that I had to look for a definition of. That's kind of embarassing to admit. But this book is excellent and I highly recommend it.
B008673ZAQ|3.0|While I enjoyed the first book in the Crossfire series, I felt that the plot of book two was too drawn out over a series of jealousy- induced break-up sessions, followed by some less-than-stellar make-up scenes.  The ending was predictable, and although I feel invested in the main characters, I am reluctant that anything else can come from their plot lines at this point, so I fear book 3 will be even worse than book 2.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I love this game. It is a that once you start you can not stop paying. I was looking for apps one day and and I said I needed a drawing game and I saw this one and I got it.
B009MF5BXK|5.0|This was a christmas gift. The movie was requested by my daughter who was excited to receive it and was looking forward to watching it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I was convinced by a friend to read the first book. I didn't think I'd like it. Now I am sad to be finishing the second knowing I have only one book left.
B00846REIS|4.0|The plot line shows &#34;shades&#34; of another novel in this genre.  Young clumsy girl meets high-powered, filthy rich, and gorgeous single man.  He has to have her, and she eventually can't resist the chemistry they have.  I will say that I enjoyed the tension between the main characters with hints of possession rather than dominance.
0345529057|5.0|I am hooked on these books. Can't wait for the next volume in the series. Saw the HBO special after reading and found the characters well portrayed. The books are great!!!!!
B00A0SKFLG|2.0|Confusing storyline. Very hard to follow.  Remake is not as good as the original.  Lost interest after 30 minutes but forced myself to watch.
0765301598|5.0|I have not read it yet as I have so many Dune books to get through. I assume I will love it (like all the others of the Series)
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I'm usually not one to read books. As a matter of fact, I usually spend about a month or two reading a simple 200 page book. But this book I just could not put down. I literally read this in less than 24 hours.<br /> Logan Lerman is my most favorite person. When I found out about this movie, I was really looking forward to watching it. later found out about this book and I knew that I just had to have it. Now that I've read this, watching the movie will be that much more exciting. This book inspired me with some life lessons and some pretty good common sense. I highly recommend this book to anyone of any age.
B005Q1W0ZQ|5.0|I am hooked on this series. The costuming is superb and the setting for Abbey is at a historic manor house. The plots are fabulous with great wit (especially Lady Violet played by Dame Maggie Smith). You become absorbed into the life of the characters and the fabric of the life of those in the early 1900's. Historic facts are enmeshed with their lives making the dialogue all the more believable.<br /><br />I wish I had known that the Christmas special was part of this DVD. I had purchased it separately and didn't need to go through the added expense. Can't wait for season 3.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This is a turn of the century period piece in which we follow the lives of the wealthy English property owners and the servants that run their manor. Production value, notably the costumes, and acting are not to be missed. Every episode gets better and better!
B006DRVFRQ|4.0|I enjoy the interface very much, also this is a full functioning google reader, which is good enough for me.
B005KELW26|4.0|Nice color & fits the Fire very well.  Tab is magnetized so stays put.  I can't imagine having a Kindle without a cover!
B004J4WLB4|5.0|This book is well-written, engaging, and informative. Interesting character development. Tackles a topic rarely considered in a novel. Supplemental list of the meaning of flowers
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|This is one of my favorite Sherlock series. As a child, I read the stories and watched the BBC show. This series is WAY different from all that! I would consider it a vast improvement. Sherlock is not stuffy or not relatable anymore. Also, Lucy Liu as Holmes is brilliant!
B005FITIGO|4.0|This is a well made movie that is thought provoking and clearly tells the story behind real life, every day scenes.  Well worth watching.
0316056871|5.0|Arrived fast in good condition. I love this book! Tina Fey is smart and hilarious and it is a good read.
B005MYEPXC|5.0|This movie arrived exactly when they said it would and it is one of my favorites.  It is perfectly type cast and a fun movie to watch and fade away into the characters and Paris.
B002N2LEVM|5.0|This show is AMAZING science fiction proven by the fact it was cancelled way too soon. A little spy, a little science fiction makes for a lot of great drama.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|In less than one week ive managed to read all three. It was one of the most powerful love stories. I hope we see more from Christian and Ana
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Worth every cent in price, every minute in time. A powerful period costume drama (some call a Soap) with historical excellence upstaged by perfection in acting. It's the \\"Roots\\" of historical family drama for the 21st century. You'll drool your champagne over locations, costumes, props, and sets.<br />AND IT'S TO CONTINUE FOR A 4th SEASON. The biggest question is not will it maintain the UK and US growing following, but will it contain Matthew Crowley (Dan Stevens). But he's at least back doing his best and wedding Mary (Michelle Dockery) and will take over the realm of Downton Abbey, even though Earl Robert (Hugh Bonneville) has bungled the finances, always a plot among the early English wealthy families.<br /><br />Yes, much of the former cast is back, joined with the American upstart actress Shirley MacLaine playing Cora's (Elizabeth McGovern) American mother. With this huge star going against the impeccable delivery of lines from Dowager Violet (Maggie Smith), the excitement and cast excellence remains. Combined, these 2 drive a thread of sharp-spark delight through this third series. She's welcomed by cast and viewers. Past issues, like imprisonment, the Bates, Anna & John, also continues in romance/tragedy form.<br />Although the UK gets first peeks, it is America that is driving worldwide success. It will continue in some form, and at the peak of seductive drama.<br /><br />To Downton Abbey fans, it is just \\"family\\" being viewed.<br /><br />The 1920 English lifestyle of the aristocrat and their home staff has never been presented better since Upstairs, Downstairs. Only time will tell if Downton Abbey fans will drive this series beyond the regal success of U,D. I suspect they will. It's powerful writing coming from the pen of Julian Fellowes, and perhaps will end only at his decision. The writing behind the Abbey is as deliciously alluring toward characters as Catherine Cookson's work. Already the public demands more, I and my wife included. She nearly wore out season 2 DVDs and will do likewise to Season 3. We'll order Season 4 as soon as the listing appears.<br />SUBTITLED.<br /><br />Not a rental. It's a MUST OWN. Place it on the all-time classic shelf.<br />Do you own season's 1&2?

B0086700CM|4.0|its pretty cool although sometimes it all of a widen asks me to connect to the Internet even I don't have to. then when I go back to the game its frozen and I have to exit out and renter
B00A0SJWQU|2.0|The acting and dialogue was awful. The special effects were straining to support the porous plot.<br />I would not watch this film again unless I had one of the those systems that erases my memory so that I could  survive viewing the agonizing poor acting.
B00992CF6W|5.0|The game is awesome please buy it, it's WORTH the money.  It is kinda like the Computer kind, but you can build anything you want!  :) :D
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|I have always loved the dash games. I hope that Play First put's more dash games on Kindle! This game is awesome and very addictive!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|this does anything a normal calculator does. easy to use, and printblarge enough for even those who need large print. i would reccomend this to everyone needing a calculator.
B009MO57H6|4.0|Saw it lastnight. This movie is just setting up whatever crazyass finale is waiting a film away. They cram in all the cool references from the games without losing interest of those who havent played them (Las Plagas). It's fun, it's good looking, and Bingbing Li as Ada Wong is the sexiest sight i've ever seen on film (to me..). Watch it and have fun with it. The sight at the end of the movie and Ada Wong's looks alone make this an impressive filler-chapter of the series.
B00AE2J5HI|5.0|I was a little skeptical when I rented this movie, but l have always been interested in this historical period, so I thought, why not ? Shia Lebouf was great as always, but I really loved Tom Hardy and his character, Don't miss this movie !
B008BM0IUG|5.0|Well written and I insightful. It takes careful reading due to the new concept and abstract ideas. Sean Carroll does a great job explaining these.
B000S1M9LY|5.0|This is a challenging book to read, quite long, and with shifting time frames and scenarios. I am reading it for the 2nd time on the Kindle, which is recommended since there are extensive footnotes throughout, which are at the end of the print edition. This book deals with some dark subjects -- addiction, dysfunction, depression, compulsion. Wallace is able to treat some very unsympathetic characters in an understanding and non-judgmental way, and his outlook is ultimately not cynical. I've seen the terms &#34;postmodern&#34; and &#34;meta-fiction&#34; used to describe Infinite Jest, however those terms carry very broad meanings. Not for the faint of heart, but very rewarding!
B000J3OTSM|5.0|Well if you are a Channing Tatum fan this movie is worth watching.  It does not show off his body as much as Magic Mike, but the dancing in it is so incredible it just takes my breath away.  Tatum definitely proves he is a great actor and also has many other dimensions.
B007QPFGJW|4.0|Harry Hole has long presented us with a downward spiral of depression and alienation that would make Kurt Wallander jump off the Turning Tower in Malmo.  Why Hole hasn't tried to take a header off the Tryvannstårnet in Oslo seems rooted in his inability to leave an injustice unmolested.  Hole continually gives life to Doc Holliday's observations of his hypocrisy in Tombstone, but with a purity of heart (and lung) Holliday never knew.<br /><br />Here, Eastern European thugs move in from Sweden and are given the formula for a synthetic heroin that provides an ultimate high without stopping the junkie from breathing.  Hole's lost love Rakel has returned to Oslo with her son Oleg who is accused of murdering his partner in dealing the drug.<br /><br />Told from two narrative standpoints; the dead dealer, and the writer's narrative of Hole's fevered work to clear Oleg, this is the most desperate Harry Hole novel, and perhaps the one in which Hole comes closest to his own redemption.  I liked it a lot.
B002RT69QQ|5.0|Replaced another that was difficult to use.  This one has centrally located &#34;plug&#34; and fits readily into computer port.  Easy &#34;in and out&#34; of flash card.
B000SVZIDA|5.0|I love this movie. It's a great love story with a wonderful sound track. It will keep your attention till the end.
0307276902|5.0|I just bought a copy for my dad.  He is a pastor in West Virginia and because of my life he has decided to work with addicts.  This book has allowed me to stay clean (off of meth and crack) for almost 5 years now.  The author has GREAT insight and doesn't sit around pretending that addiction is a disease.  The weak people that refuse to acknowledge that they are in control and want to blame a disease will never get better.  This book points out self-responsiliity and taking responsibility and credit for your success and for your failures.  I highly recommend this book to anyone stuggling with addiction.  If you actually believe it you will succeed!
B009VB9VKY|3.0|I didn't know much about this before I rented it and had low expectations.  More dance scenes, better quality dance scenes, more plot than expected.  The ending was anti-climactic.  Expected more depth from Matthew McCounahey &#60;sp&#62; character.
B005VPRFSY|4.0|My 5 year old got fr Christmas.  He didn't love it, but its good quality.  He liked the figures it came with.
B004U52VPS|3.0|So, I guess I didn't pay attention to the fact that this was for very young kiddos.  The 10 year old was not completely impressed and I don't blame him.
B000TEUSJK|5.0|I have never seen any movie that goees to this length.  Penthouse directing it should have been a clue I suppose.  This movie goes so far above and beyond ANY sexual movie out there...it is as good as porn (since that is what a lot of it is), but even gets into the sexually perverse.  I recommend this movie 100 percent!  Make sure you order the English version though...I accidentally ordered some other language and had to re-buy it in English!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this app lots of games to play I haven't even unlocked them all yet the only thing I don't like is it dont tell you how to play each game
B009FZHYKU|4.0|Third season much better than second.  I got tired of the second season - too much drama and too little story line.  This season much more interesting.  Good introduction of additional characters.
B004GE1PDW|5.0|This is a great book with really good information for the upcoming Zombie Apocolypse!  Lot's of smart ideas and plans!  Be ready folks, get this book!  ;-)
B005OK721G|3.0|I have watched it twice (so it's good enough to watch a second time) but isn't the greatest movie ever made.  Zoe Saldana is great and shows her ability and sexiness in this movie!

0061134007|5.0|I was deeply saddened when I finished the Stieg Larsson series and despaired of finding something that would hold a candle to those three books.  Because of a suggestion from Amazon (go Amazon!) I tried &#34;The Redbreast&#34; by Jo Nesbo and  loved it.  Harry Hole is a deeply flawed character, but a man of integrity as he sees it.  I've now read a number of the Harry Hole series and highly recommend it for those who love this type of novel.  Thanks, Amazon.
B003H9MSPG|5.0|we've gotten hours of play from this little bad boy ... very fun! thanks for a great gun nerf! ... you made me a happy mom!
B005LAIIPS|3.0|Was OK!  Nothing to write home about.  Liked the Matt Damon ones alot more.  On the disappointed side.  Felt let down.
B007IXWL2C|1.0|The story is only to make it possible to have the erotic scenes.  No social value.  BUT easy read and escape.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I played the easy version of this game with my pre-school aged daughter and we both enjoyed it immensely.  It wasn't too scarey or boring.

B009POCG2C|5.0|Very heart warming, great ending.  I thoroughly enjoyed this DVD.  Would love more like it.  Hope Clint Eastwood comes out with more.
B008D28HYS|4.0|I have both the &quot;monochrome&quot; original and this color version. This version carried over well. In some ways it was a little easier once you realize some strategy (I'll let you learn it on your own) but still has its challenges.<br /><br />It would be nice to add a thumbnail or map to the side. As there are more clues due to different colors, the initial board is smaller in appearance. So it can be confusing when zooming in. As alternative, maybe &quot;locking&quot; the clues while scrolling around the board might be a good idea.<br /><br />I'd also like to be able to save progress instead of relying on the way it saves a  puzzle, too many times I've tried a hunch and screwed up to force me to reset.<br /><br />One more thing, especially for the color version, it'd be fun to let us make our own boards, either from scratch or importing a (pixellated) picture to share with friends or other players.<br /><br />But, solid game overall, very fun and challenging.
0374275637|4.0|Applied decision making and what shapes it--that's the very practical take home from this intelligent book. Whether you are negotiating family matters with the kids or the spouse, or investing in stocks or running an office, read this book and you will be better at what you want to do.<br /><br />I should add that it has a lot of insight for anyone interested in the power and place of story in our conscious and unconscious decision making. If I were still teaching literature, I'd use this as a text.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Another fast enjoyable read with a sad but realistic ending based on the ongoing story plot.  I wish they combined books two and three into one movie but that's a different point.
B007ZI06FE|5.0|This is definitely the first book in a series with the next book being about Will.  I am so excited!  I am a sucker for steampunk romance!<br /><br />There is waaay too much going on in this book to do an adequate job with a summary, but I will attempt my usual super short summary:<br /><br />Honoria is the oldest of three siblings.  She had to move them to Whitechapel and she is in hiding and on the run from the blue bloods in general and Lord Vickers in particular.  Her brother Charlie is sick and younger sister, Lena is working as well to help support the three of them.  Honor gets summoned the leader of Whitechapel abode and thus begins her tentative dealings with a rogue blue blood.  But Honor keeps her secrets close even as Blade (said leader of Whitechapel) works to learn all her secrets.  They have one common enemy and the problem of a vampire hunting in Whitechapel.<br /><br />Seriously, so much more happens to even begin to cover all the bases, but you will love it!  I loved Blade, seriously I loved every second of Blade.  I liked Honor most of the time and could understand her reasoning, but sometimes I just wanted to pull her hair and make her tell Blade all her secrets.  Will wasn't so loveable and I read the exerpt from his story that is at the end of Kiss of Steel and he still doesn't seem loveable, but I guess I will just have to trust that the author can make him grow on me.<br /><br />The beginning was a bit confusing because there was a lot of new lingo being thrown at the reader, but I soon caught on.  I did think that the whole infection with blood craving virus to blue blood to vampire link took too long to come out in the book.  That should have been explained clearly earlier on.<br /><br />Favorite Quote/Scene:  This scene is towards the beginning of the book when Honoria and Blade are still working out their deal.  Blade is at a fight night when three blue bloods show up (one being Leo Barrons) and Honoria shows up.\\"<br /><br />\\"Barrons was watching with his arms crossed over his chest.  Just as he'd suspected.  Blade gave him another chilling smile. `Mine,' he mouthed silently, knowing Barrons could read his lips.watching with his arms crossed over his chest.  Just as he'd suspected.  Blade gave him another chilling smile. `Mine,' he mouthed silently, knowing Barrons could read his lips.
B005LLSNNE|4.0|At the end of each season I question if they can keep up such a suspenseful story line, and to my delight, they do.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Never been interested in racing, but this book is more than that. Love the point of view of Enzo, the dog.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|A easy read but kept you wanting more and more<br />Loved how Megan didn't give in and stuck to her plan all along author keeps you in throughout the entire book
B007WFTFG6|1.0|I downloaded this app and my antivirus on my tablet flagged it as having intrusive adware.  just be aware and I recommend you have an antivirus on your phone or tablet before putting on any kids apps, they have lots of intrustive malware on them.
B009DCOU9S|4.0|Although I used the hints occasionally. it did not detract. from the game.  I will definately purchase more games from nevosoft.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|This case is terrible. It is flimsy, the clear screen does not fit snug against the phone and causes a wave effect, which is distracting, the case somehow occludes the speaker so when talking it sounds fuzzy and playing music sounds fuzzy and garbled. It is hard to put it on silent and and the charger port is is awkward. I threw the package out when I got it because I thought it would be great based on other reviews so I could not return it, but I bought another case anyway.
B00AA0TJO8|4.0|I really like this game, it's addictive! But, every time you die, which I do frequently in the later levels, you have to start back at the beginning of the level - very tedious! Isn't it possible to allow a few deaths that restart you at your current position, then restart the level after 3 deaths? I don't want to have to redo everything every time, but I want to play the game!
B004EPYZUS|3.0|NOT AS GOOD AS THE FIRST ONE BUT IT STILL HAD SOME EXCITEMENT. I WOULD ADD IT TO MY COLLECTION.
B000ATQYT2|4.0|If you were a fan of the movie growing up, like I was, then it might be a bit of a disappointment to know that they left out a song. The duet, &#34;When Love Is Gone&#34;, is not included in the movie. Other than that, it seems to be the same.
1451613512|5.0|Anybody who is a real patriot should read it, dismiss all the knowledge about world and US of A that you obtained via TV or press , read it, go on-line - fact check it, You will never look at the news the same way. When I read about Bush's war, about Iraq, Iran, Afganistan I was so upset I had to twice put the book aside !!!!!  We've been lied to, kept in the darkness by our GOP government and their cronies, we forgot that beside our beloved country there is a rest of the world - it seems like better than ours , quieter, more peaceful. I know that as of now I will will pay more attention to the facts presented, politics, laws and leader \\"explanations\\" . I've promised myself that my 20 year old daughter will read it and I WILL change her views too, my 7 year son will have a series of conversations with me too. We pledging allegiance to our country , to our fellow citizens, but our leaders are doing everything in their considerable power to make our lives as miserable as possible , sincerely polish-american Kris K.

B009HEJXFS|3.0|The fun went out of the story without Tommy Lee Jones. Don't get me wrong, Josh Brolin did a fine, fine job, but the tone was way too serious for the Franchise.
B00006J9OV|5.0|This is a Parsifal Wagner would have approved of.  As, usual, Levine and the others responsible for this version, showed understanding and respect for Wagner's work and intentions.  The main problem I have with other recordings available is they interpret things, either knowingly or unknowingly, which change the meaning of the work or sometimes make a complete mockery of it.  Kundy's death, written by Wagner, and actually portrayed here, is essential to the story.  There is no way around it and any director who thinks they can play the \\"feminist\\" and have Kundry live, simply doesn't get it.<br /><br />Besides that, the scenery is beautiful, the costumes great and Levine and the orchestra do a very admirable job.  The casting seems perfectly appropriate to me, which may be luck, as finding the right looking people for opera roles is not something you can count on.<br /><br />Those interested in Wagner's works for their philosphic content can watch this version without fear.

B006O6F932|3.0|My daughter is a Monster High addict. She's been asking for this FOR MONTHS. She got it for Christmas from Santa and this is what the helper elf says:<br />\\"For the money it's a cheap piece of plastic. If you touch it wrong (even with the lever in place) it falls. The ladder doesn't stay on, you can't see some of the cute walls unless you are packing it up, and there is an entire page of stickers, that have zero instructions on where to put them. The dolls appear too big for the school, and the \\"furniture\\" that comes with it falls apart when you sit a doll on them.\\"<br />Here is what my daughter and friends say: \\"It is sooooooooooooooo  awesome!<br /><br />I say- its pricey for being  so poorly made. I don't think it will last like my 30 year old Barbie Dream house, but my daughter loves it......so totally worth it. :)

B004G5ZY7E|5.0|This book has the suspense I need in order to not read the end of the book before I finish it.  Good character and plot development, lots of curves to keep you guessing, and I really enjoyed learning about another country and another city.  I love that we now have a lot of fiction available here in the US from authors in other countries like the UK, Ireland, Sweden, The Netherlands and more.  I will be reading more from Jo Nesbo.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I read several bad reviews about this book, but I found the ending quite appropriate. I read more for the love story however, instead of the underlying themes. I agree with several other reviews that pacing was slow and that Katniss spent to much time in the hospital or drugged. Also I didn't like the deaths of Prim and Finnick, but I  can understand them. I know we needed Prim to die to expose Coins true intentions, but it seems so tragic because the whole story began because Katniss wanted to protect Prim and she dies anyway. Many seem to think the ending was shallow and depressing and left no hope for happiness, but I disagree. Katniss did say she was troubled when feeling the baby inside her, but it was erased with the joy of holding her. Also she stated on bad days it was impossible to find joy in anything for fear it be taken away, this suggests to me that there are also good days. I never believed the romance between Katniss and Gale and the way he acted towards the end I wasn't upset when he left. The only real thing that bothered me in this book is that Katniss did not fight harder to bring Pete back to her after her desperation to save his life in the second book. Also I still have a few nagging questions. What happened to Annie? To Johanna? Was Annie able to stay sane for her child? Also I haven't seen anyone mention this, but Paylor was elected the new president and she is the one that let Katniss in to talk to Snow. Did she know what was going to happen? Is she just as calculating? Just some food for thought, but overall I was pleased.

B0084I9QIW|5.0|Whilst the picture quality is not Hd the concert is amazing. Unlike his later works, this is a much straighter concert in terms of just singing without the lavish theatrics. Sound is quite good.  Worth noting is that actually has a few brief dropouts of video and audio but who's complaining.

B00A9X9TIW|4.0|The beauty of time travel movies are the paradoxes.<br /><br />The weakness of time travel movies are the paradoxes.<br /><br />The paradoxes make this movie interesting. In the best science fiction film, the paradoxes after the fact are resolved in a satisfactory manner.  It makes sense.<br /><br />Loopers does complete the loop but not in a completely satisfactory manner.  It makes an effort, but the explanation is very shallow and doesn't hold up to deep scrutiny. I still enjoyed the movie and as long as I don't focus on the illogic of some of the plot twists, it is a worthwhile experience.
B009TZ7WDK|5.0|This pair of singers are extraordinary!! I saw a clip of their audition on one of the finding talent shows and was just blown away by how good they were. Expect great things from this pair.

It didn't look to interesting based on the pictures.<br /><br />The reviews across the internet compelled me.<br /><br />I have to say, this game is very different than other rpg's, but still very fun. It's more of a mystery/sci-fi  rpg that involves jumping into a tv world to do battle.<br /><br />This game is absolutely a MUST HAVE for the vita.<br /><br />This is the game that's going to be talked about for years and set the benchmark for all future vita games.<br /><br />Don't miss Persona 4 Golden.
B0015DROBO|5.0|After I got a little under half way through the book, I devoted nearly every minute to finishing it. Incredible story that gets you yearning to see what is next around the next corner.

B0076DCT2G|5.0|The humor incorporated in the character of John Corey is brilliant.  We see these &#34;action heroes/heroines&#34; as always being so serious and stoic and this humor shows a more human, relatable side to the character.

B003D0ZNWY|3.0|Several of the symphonies are ancient recordings which just sound bad... they are interesting to hear ONCE, because some of these early recordings have the conductors choosing very unusual tempos. (When the music was relatively &#34;new&#34;, and not yet &#34;standardized&#34;). I can handle scratches, but when the entirety of &#34;sound&#34; is this awful, I just can't stand listening more than once or twice.<br /><br />It's a great buy, and several of the recordings are pretty good. But it's not &#34;complete&#34; for everyday listening, some of them are just too weird, and some are just too badly recorded and transferred.<br /><br />If only there was a New York/Bernstein, or a San Francisco/MTT, Or a Berlin/VonKarajan set which didn't require a new mortgage to buy...
B0058YPLA2|5.0|The series captures your attention and imagination. I will buy season two as well. Good for families to watch together.
B005CRQ2XA|5.0|Awesome book it was nice. And the best part was when he got really really really really mad so I get it now
B008Z9YGEE|5.0|Having read the novels, I was highly anticipating the first in the trilogy. I have always had a difficult time watching a movie adaptation of a book I loved. This was no disappointment. The characters were three dimensional, their back stories filled in as much as possible given the time constraints. And my husband and daughter, who had not read the books, were mesmerized.
B007I1Q4W2|4.0|This is yet another Zombie film, but I just find them so addictive that I thought I would give this one a go. And I must say I am really glad I did. It is set in the aftermath of the American Civil War; we are taken to Tennessee in 1865 where we are introduced to Edward Young played by upcoming newbie Mark Gibson. He has come home to find his wife has `turned' and his beloved son is missing. He kills and buries his wife and then gets on his trusted steed called `Shiloh', and sets off to find his missing son; always fearing the worst. He has authentic weapons for the period too which is something I always appreciate.<br /><br />The plot is told with the use of some animation, which I didn't get at first but it actually added quite a bit to the whole atmosphere of the film, which is one of its strong points. The story is being narrated by an heir to Edward called Malcolm Young, and this voice is that of Brian Cox, who is always excellent even when it is just the timbre and passion of his voice.<br /><br />On his search he meets more of the undead and then he meets up with some more dangerous folk and these ones aint Zombies. I really liked this film, it has a haunting quality that has nothing to do with the subject matter but the excellent performances put in by the entire cast. The special effects are all excellent too and the Zombies are the good old fashioned kind who amble around moaning in their blood lust, with dead eyes being left as windows to a soul that has long since vacated.<br /><br />This is an original and emotionally charged take on the Zombie genre that is a really refreshing change, to say too much may be a plot spoiler and this is one that you will take something from all of the action. It is not a gore fest but a study of the psychology of grief and coping in extreme circumstances, there is also superstition, love, lunacy and greed, so pretty much something for all the family - except the kids of course. Seriously put em to bed and get this film,  it is one that should not be missed.it is one that should not be missed.
B00AMSLRAC|5.0|this app is amazing it has cool features and everything to it!It kinds takes a while to.download but its still very fun.

B00A6PD8RQ|5.0|This movie was so amazing I would like to watch it 100more times in a row, and I would probably cry every time. Merida was so  brave (obviously), but when her mother got turned into a bear and wouldn't go back to human form when Merida put the blanket on her, my entire family started crying! Great movie.

B005MSD6QU|3.0|Clear and without fault... however, I am not able to copy and put on to disk would have rather had this episode available for DVD library.
0385535147|2.0|This book contains such lame dialogue and pitiful scenarios, it's incredible to me how it has a 4 star average. So many pages of filler, like a car getting cleaned and so many pages wasted on his surgery. This book only got mildly interesting around page 180, but not for long. If Grisham's name wasn't on the front cover, I firmly believe the critics would not have been so delighted. The interrogations with the various agencies were so 3rd rate and predictable. Someone with a resume like Grisham could have produced a much more taut and intriguing narrative. The story is good, don't get me wrong. But the way it was written lacked conviction and substance. The characters were thinly developed and quite uninteresting. A clumsy effort, not worth more that 2 or 3 bucks. For only the most easily satisfied  crime novel fan. It's like he was not really into this plot or was on heavy medication. A thorough let down.
B00973902K|5.0|I love this song, even if it is over played on the radio. Well worth the money to listen to it whenever I want.
1452105111|5.0|Nothing fancy here with these cardboard cutout circles with letters and E.C. characters on them, but they were perfect for our nursery with the Hungry Caterpillar theme we are using!
B004LROUNG|3.0|I enjoyed this book but there was not enough suspense.  I enjoyed the book but did not finish saying oh wow.  He has some great books and some average.
B000FA5TTW|5.0|I'm not a big reader but I truly enjoyed reading this. The storyline was excellent and very well written.  I loved it!
B003P2WO5E|5.0|This was an amazing story, steeped in detail and rich with fantasy. Brandon Sanderson has created an amazing world so stark yet so full of life and mystery
B009XHAM8G|5.0|Sat and read this book to my two adult sons and they had tears in their eyes as well as I. Gave it to my sister-in-law to read to her two grown adult sons and she couldn't get through the first page without crying.  Great book about te circle of life and how precious a mother's love is.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|This is truly the best series I have watched in years.  I love the actors I love the costumes I love the story.  Keep it going forever.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|As is his wont lately, our dear friend Clancy is painstakingly slow in his build, nearly taking us two thirds of the way through the book before you reach \\"I can't lay it down,\\" status. But, oh my, after that, hold on!<br /><br />A terrifying forecast of an improbable yet possible future low level but intense conflict with the Peoples Republic of China. The end will leave you like Lionel Hampton did in Crazy Hamp . . . with your foot poised in the air.  What happens now? This is not an anti-Sino work, only one that explores the balances in Asia.
B008RJFRTK|2.0|There is very little difference between the 2 versions.  I thought I might be able to track locations, etc. and it doesn't work any better than the one I didn't have to pay for.  Unless you are traveling with internet in your car, don't buy it.
B007N8RULO|5.0|The game is fun and challenging.  Easy to learn and use.  I would recommend it.  It is free so you can't go wrong.
B005CRQ3NY|5.0|It's awesome!I read this all the time. In fact I've read all of the books in this series. p.s I'm a kid
B00AMBH70S|5.0|I usually don't write reviews, but felt compelled to do so for this flick. For all you Jason Bourne fans, unless you are a die hard Matt Damon fan, I think you will be pleasantly surprised. Even though it was slightly slower paced, I left feeling much more satisfied than with other Bourne flicks. Matt Damon plays it with much less emotion and as a result I never felt much of his agony or frustration. Jeremy Renner plays it with much more emotion, though with enough restraint you still get the idea this guy is a trained killer. Rachel Weisz is excellent as the nerdy Doctor who steps up to the plate and takes on the bad guys as she should. It almost reminded me of the first Terminator.....\\"come with me if you want to live\\",.... \\"wait a minute, Im just a nerdy Doctor, I'm not worth killing!\\"<br />Keep an open mind, and don't go into it negative because Damon's not in it, and you will love it.
B00A0HQ7H8|1.0|This EP sounds like they took all the songs that were recorded for Born to Die that didn't make it on that album and stuffed them onto this boring EP.  Or, maybe whoever Lana's management is decided that she should make an EP that sounds exactly like Born to Die ....you know, give the people what they want...or maybe her management felt they wanted to get something out for the Christmas buying season.  Either way.....this effort sucks.<br /><br />As much as I LOVE Born to Die, I HATE Paradise.  The songs are dull at best.  There is no life to any of the songs.  The songs all have the same sound, same strings, same reverb.......which is good if you want to listen to the same thing over and over to go to sleep.<br /><br />I really want to see what Lana comes out with next before I decide to pull the plug..........the covers of Born to Die and Paradise show Lana with a look on her face like she would like to bust your teeth out of your head......I don't want to hear the same songs only the lame......next time, bust our teeth out.....
B008HK3XKO|4.0|The function of this case is excellent. It does everything you need it to do well. The stand feature for watching video, reading in landscape mode or playing some games that can display in landscape mode works perfectly. It provides a nice range of angle choice per your preference and supports the kindle very well. The sleep mode when cover is closed works flawlessly. This is a handsome looking case as well which was a surprise since the photos don' t do it justice. The plastic insert for securing the kindle is of a nice sturdy quality that is attached to the cover very well and the kindle fits into it like a glove. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is it doesn't have the cut out for charging with cover closed. This really is not a big deal though. You won't be disappointed with this product t and I'm picky!!
B009UX2YAC|3.0|I love the game but when ever I turn off my kindle all my data erases it would be much better if they fixed the glitches
B004I744AS|5.0|When i am reading and come across a word I dont know the meaning of I will stop and get my dictionary out.  The dictionary I downloaded is most helpful.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|Loved it! Very funny. Would recommend it.  Not a fan of glee but really enjoyed it.  Have seen several times now.
B005721W9O|5.0|It's a DVD.  Love the movie.  Bought it as a stocking stuffer for Christmas.  It was a last minute purchase and came in just a couple of days close to Christmas.  No issues.  Nice purchase.
0393338827|5.0|Michael Lewis is the best!  He's such a good writer and is able to make all things economic comprehensible.  This should be required reading, and the media should have been reporting this.  Forget the supposed &#34;objectivity&#34; or &#34;both sides&#34;.  Sometimes there are not two sides - the facts should be reported as facts.
B00973902K|5.0|Great sound and beat. Also an innocent sexiness in Carly's voice and style that is very attractive.  I can listen to it over and over and still enjoy it.
B00APUQH0W|4.0|Typical new style Clint drama that I think can be seen by the family. The movie that makes you wonder whats wrong with Clint till he finally shares with his daughter. Enough curves in movie to make it worth watching.
B0076DELIG|2.0|I always enjoyed Michael Connelly's writing, but this book is an insult to his readers.  He is relying solely on his name and past popularity to sell books, instead of good writing and new creativity.  The book provides so much needless filler of irrelevant details, that it reads like the work of a novice.<br />There is little description or development of characters, so the reader is left to wonder why this case is so important to Bosch and the plot is a total yawn.<br />I have given up on Grisham, Baldacci, and Connelly -- they have become nothing but formula writers printing books for the purpose of refilling their personal pocketbooks.  There is no longer any quality to their writing or their plot lines.  Claire Stanard
B000M341RI|5.0|This is a wonderful movie.  It's so well done, and gives important insight into what's at stake for men these days.  It's not easy being green... or male in today's society.
B00AMBK0X4|5.0|Not ''Laugh a Minute,'' but very funny,  I guess it's my kinda movie. Seven more words?  Well now it's zero.
B009HELT3C|2.0|The third attempt puts this one in third place behind just barely 2. There is a twist at the end that almost saves this movie to a 3 star. I think this series has run its course....what do I know?
B009UX2YAC|2.0|i dont want to be the person who says this game sucks... it doesnt. but every time i got far in the game it would re set everything. if it didnt do that it would probably be my favorite game on my kindle fire. but seeing as it does its not a good game. its really quite disappointing.
B008ALA6DW|5.0|I luse this for my retina macbook pro, sometimes the higher bandwidth is helps me do things faster compared to wireless, plus its gigabit which is a bonus. I wish it had dual ethernet ports so you can get even more bandwidth.
B005O7PXNS|5.0|I just started watching Castle on TNT and decided I couldn't wait, it is a great combination of crime show, sexual tension, humor and I love, love, love Nathan Fillion!!
B004VFYOA2|4.0|As most other reviews have stated...great audio quality and not the greatest video quality (resulting in my 1 star deduction).  Some of the video doesn't even match up with the audio, which is normally a deal breaker for me on a concert DVD.  Regardless, its a cool concert DVD for anyone who was into the 80's rock/metal scene.  It showcases Whitesnake's best lineup in my eyes.  So, its cool to have some concert footage (with stellar audio) of them in their heyday.<br /><br />If you have any similar genre DVD's in your collection, this one will be a welcome addition.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|i hate how amazon puts these great apps (android apps)  on kindle firr then when i cheack my android phone they have a update tgen when i cheack my kindle fire no update for the app like wtf amazon needs to fix that
B008ALAHA4|5.0|This does exactly what it is supposed to do. No complaints, The price is good for what it does, beets buying a new $80 charger!
075669812X|5.0|i gave to my son and his friends as a gift. they love it very much. all the information about ninjago are there. i was so happy they loved it.
0897502027|5.0|Awesome books at the right price. I Bought this book for my Husband and he loves it. Just what he wanted
B0045L0D4I|3.0|My wife and daughter like this music, so I bought it for them.  I could really do without it.  It's okay.
B000WDS04I|5.0|This tv show is great but expensive! I you miss it on tv you cant watch it anywhere else except you buy it.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Coudn't put it down. Resolution was surprising but satisfying.  Stephen King is as good as ever!  Interesting view of our world.
B005LAIIS0|5.0|Awesome and at the right price. This is a good one, Always looking for great deals on the newest blu ray videos
B00A03WBVI|4.0|I like listening to this music.  It's pretty good and upbeat.  Most of the tracks sound the same.  They need to mix it up more.
1932100385|5.0|This follows a study over many years of the effect of diet on cancer and many other diseases.  It is a real eye opener and will make anyone take a hard look at what they eat.  It was recommended by a friend and I read it over a two day period.  I've gone back and looked back over several chapters several times since.
B007712XAU|5.0|We love historical fiction and this series is excellent.  The first half of the first season is a little slow as you meet the characters and all the back stories are set, all of which is necessary.  After that, you can't stop watching!  The series has become a topic of conversation at all gatherings of all ages.  We gave the two seasons to my parents (84) for Christmas and they had finished it by New Years and want to pre-order season 3.<br /><br />A great value and great entertainment.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|...and all the characters but at times, I found the conversations between some of the characters jibberjash and I just wanted the author to move on; hence, only the 4 stars.  If I could have rated 4 1/2 stars, I would have.<br /><br />I loved the main characters in the book and find myself still thinking about them even though the last page of the novel has been read...that's how I KNOW it was a very good book.<br /><br />I laughed out loud at some parts, cried at some parts and was moved by all of it.<br /><br />KUDOS to the author and my sincere appreciation for such a lovely, moving novel.
B008DB2Y3O|3.0|The wife and daughter like this album.  I could do without it.  I don't really like the album.  It's okay.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Adorable,  entertaining,  and ponies! How can you go wrong? You can't! The timers on activities and collections are even a good length.
B0028IDXDS|1.0|I was desperately looking for solution to the pacifier always falling out of my 2 month old baby's mouth making him cry hysterically particularly when I'm driving. I read reviews and thought this product would be a lifesaver but I was so disappointed. First, the pacifier that comes with the toy is flimsy, it's not the same quality as the actually one that you buy separately. Also, the way it is sewn on to the mouth of the toy, it pulls the pacifier out of the baby's mouth making it even more difficult for the baby to hang on to it then if it was just a pacifier without the toy. I waited by the door to receive this and unfortunately it was a huge waste. Going back to holding the pacifier in myself.
B003FSTN7A|5.0|Brand new nothing wrong, love the show!! got here qucik and me and my mom are always watching it we were very happy!!!
B001B6PBBK|5.0|I thought it was a great movie in all aspects and am surprised some viewers couldn't grasp that after reading the reviews.
B00574P9EQ|5.0|Loved this movie, my daughter loves this series!  She has all the books and says that it is very close to the book.
B000002BE9|3.0|It isnt as good as I had hoped  some of the songs put me to sleep  I would NOT recommend it to my friends
B004V2S4SS|5.0|LOVE THIS show got here new nothing worng my and my mom watched it right away and love it !!!
B009NH6AOQ|5.0|I just wanted to say how much I love this series, the characters, the writing, the acting, the special effects. It's all A+ movie quality and will suck you in from the very beginning. Once you get to know some of the amazing characters on this show, you will never be able to stop watching it. Just an amazing television series and maybe the best to come along since Lost. Amazing series....
B000VL9XE2|5.0|I love their music.  I had the cd, but I either lost it or it was stolen, so I bought it a second time.  The perfect balance of sound and silence.
B004YM6JI2|5.0|Season 7 of Supernatural has some of the best scenes with Dean and Sam. They continue their battle with demons, Lucifer and with themselves as they struggle with their quilt about life and work choices.
B002BJGYTY|4.0|I choose it for a friend gift. I like it 'cause my friend is happy about the movie and it works good. I recommend it for a friend, no problem !
B007S3S8HO|1.0|Bought two of these for my 7 year old for Christmas (age says 5 and up). The directions to put the structure together are terrible. I think there were less than 10 steps for 176 pieces, so very difficult to follow. He could not put it together alone at all, absolutely needed adult help.  I understand the purpose of the game is for the birds to knock it over, but it is so poorly constructed and unstable it was difficult to keep together with nothing even touching it.  A frustrating toy, not worth the money.
B001ECE6D0|5.0|Loved the whole cd, but I bought it for only one song.  I listened to it the whole way through and then the second time listening to it, it felt familiar.  The songs are really catchy and I fell in love with them right away.
B005IZLPKQ|4.0|Great product, awesome movie, and lightning fast shipping!!Chris Evans is the best actor for this job and he pulls it off Fantastically!!
B002BJGYV2|4.0|I choose it for a friend gift. I like it 'cause my friend is happy about the movie and it works good. I recommend it for a friend, no problem !
B009MCRHH6|4.0|I like this game....I did not get far before I got stuck but I have not had a lot of time to really try too hard either. The graphics are nice and for the FAOTD it is GREAT.
B005LAII12|5.0|good quality came on time, i was very happy with this product. it was given as a gift and had us all in lasting laughter for most of it.
B009K45Y62|2.0|I was surprised by how small the cowl was, but other than that the item is very nice. There is no case for the discs as they fit in a compartment on the back of the base for the cowl.
B0038P59A0|5.0|Even though I have seen it a couple of times  I still love watching it.  So sit back relax and enjoy!!
B005D9MUWY|4.0|Not much to say.  The app does what it needs to do and provides words nicely as it learns your style.  Overall, good product.
B0006ZE7G2|5.0|I bought this DVD because I had seen the wall back in high school some 30 years ago and forgot what it was about.  It's a mind blower but great movie! A must see.  Recommend to anyone that is a Floyd fan or who is curious about the movie.
B009JBWOU0|3.0|Be advised that when you buy this there is only a feature on the disc for The Dark Knight Rises. Batman Begins and The Dark Knight are the same as the Wal-Mart versions that have no special features.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Good for everyone. Feels like you are exercising even while sitting on the toilet. My 5 and 8 year old play it too which seem odd to me.
B001P59V5Y|5.0|You definitely won't be dissappointed.  Probably the best of all of the Monty Python movies (except maybe Meaning of Life).
B00AE2IJIE|1.0|There's no way this movie should be PG. This had a lot of violence and a lot of for gore. This should be PG-13 at a minimum.
B0085TKAW6|4.0|Although it is a work of researched fiction, the story gives one cause to reflect on the pain and suffering inflicted on the world by tyrants of all colours and the ease with which people can follow an ideal blindly causing untold misery!<br /><br />Looking forward to the next book in the trilogy.
B007BZM3HK|5.0|This song is extremely cathy and if you love this song buy it now! The quality of this MP3 is worth it and it's great that you can play it through Amazon Cloud Player.
B004DM0UII|5.0|Great list of stations and features, works well on my phone and tablet.  I highly recommend this app for music streaming.
B007VPLNGW|5.0|A fun addictive game but, it has some technical problems.  Japan, level 20, freezes every time I get to this level.  It takes a lot of &#34;tapping&#34; on the screen and several minutes for it to unfreeze.  There is another level that does the same thing but, I don't remember which level. With these &#34;glitches&#34; fixed it will be a great fun game.
B009E3EXMU|5.0|Purchased this for my husband for Christmas.  I ordered at the last minute but as usual, Amazon came through with quick delivery and my hubby was very happy.  Started watching it on Christmas Day!
B000L53D4O|5.0|This a great toy. I purchased it for my now 7 month old. He was automatically drawn to it. The bright colors are attractive. This toy is fun fun fun!!
B009MF5BXK|4.0|As far as the movie goes, it DID live up to my expectations. Even the Extras were better than I expected. However it was the packaging of it that was a bit disappointing. The problem was that the package says it INCLUDES Digital and Ultra-violet copies. But the package ONLY includes a DVD copy, while you have to go to another web site to retrieve the others. WHY??? OK, so the Ultra-violet copy isn't really a physical copy, but the digital copy is (as far as I know). I have gotten at least one other movie in the past (I believe it was UP), and a digital copy on disc WAS included. So WHY was it missing in this package??? It makes no sense that I should have to pursue it via another web site, not that it's really all that important to me personally since the DVD will play just fine on my computer anyway. It's the principal of the thing!!<br /><br />Fred Clemens
0452289963|3.0|At first I liked this book alot, but the more I got into it I felt that the message was very repetitive and it could have been edited way down in size, which is true of many of what I would call &#34;spiritual writers&#34;.  In addition, I felt it leaned too far in religious messages, with Biblical references and Christian theology.<br /><br />I prefer the work of Thich Nhat Hanh, Vietnamese monk living in France. His work is in the same vein, but without an underlying moral and religious message.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I have been a Grisham fan for years.  Although this particular work is not as good as some of his earlier works- it didn't disappoint. Grisham is a diverse writer and has great range.  I enjoy his expression and exploration in other writing arenas. This particular work, as the author describes himself, is not a legal thriller.  As many other reviewers have indicted, if you are a lawyer, you may have to set aside your experience/reality. I suppose it would be similar to a police officer reading a police thriller.  This happens all the time in fiction.  Grisham, although a diverse writer, did not disappoint with his usual writing style. His characters are rich.  He slowly presents information, it may appear to be irrelevant however that is the clue that it will be important later.  I found myself waiting for his new work and was engrossed till the end.  While not his absolute best work, I enjoyed this novel.  I always \\"await\\" his works and will continue to look forward to his work.  He is like the Tom Cruise of authors.  Not all of his works can be equal, reality may be stretched, but we find the \\"action\\", style, consistency and talent- entertaining and engrossing. A great read on a cold winter night.
B007ADIRDM|5.0|My daughters got a few Monster High items and this one they loved the most. They pretend they're at Starbucks the Monster version of course.
B005XOPEOU|4.0|As I expected and listened into it before on an airplane, this is a great Album for those who generally likle Coldplay's music.<br />Some slow but not boring tracks, some more powerful. Very good purchase.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|I enjoyed the movie.  It was good.  picture was great...Good cast and whatever.  Good little movie to rent.  that's all.
B009PNQUXO|1.0|the app downloaded smooth and opened fast...but when I typed in something it would say loading links and it took a really long time... I don't think anyone should get this app
B008N1V11U|5.0|This game is pure awesome and I got it for kindle it has amazing  graphics and there's only been 1 glitch the whole time I played which was the the pit level but I got past that but I love the fighting and what I love most is you get to rude your vehicle in a 3D environment which is awsome
B008B3H4VQ|5.0|Very versatile & powerful Album, the only title that does not really fit in the mood stream for my opinion, is title 7.<br />I've never been a big listener to Linkin Park before, but this Album cought my attention on an airplane and I liked it that much that I bought it afterwards. Thumbs up.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This app is amazing and also the apps craft zombieland and other apps that involves minecraft read the description<br />That is all
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It was amazingly amazing....... way better than the movie I totally recommend this book to anyone who loved the movie too
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|Good story line, good moral to the story, and good animation.  If you are Scottish, the movie is an added delight since it is based in Scotland.  What's not to like?
B0097EWK3A|5.0|I like mystery games that have a good story line, and that also let you solve puzzles and find objects. The dialog in this game was well done, and it was easy to maneuver in the game. The hint button was really helpful -you have to wait for it to recharge while playing the mini games and thankfully it does not penalize you for using it-. When you're just maneuvering around in the game you can use the hint button as often as you need to without having to wait for it to recharge -and again, no penalties-.<br />When you start the game you have the option to play the game normally or play it to where you receive points. I personally like to play the game normally, and I like the feature where it lets you choose.<br />When you're looking for objects you can zoom in, and you are not penalized for tapping on the wrong object.<br />When you're trying to solve the puzzles, it will give you instructions on how to solve it. Again, you are not penalized for putting something in the wrong spot, or getting something wrong and having to redo it. If you use the hint button you need to let it recharge before using it again but you are not penalized for it. Also when you're trying to solve a puzzle, and just cannot get past it and can't figure it out, you do have the option to skip the puzzle and it will just solve it for you and then resume with the rest of the game. You're not penalized for doing that either. I, on the other hand, chose to solve all of the puzzles because I like puzzles.<br />So, if you are someone who likes a mystery game with a good story line, puzzles, and object finding games, this game is for you. :)<br />I have to say that I can't wait to play the sequel to this game. :)<br />I hope this review helps you. :)<br /><br />~* Stefie J *~
B0034G4P9E|4.0|I liked the story building up to the final fight, and was torn between who should win. I don't want to give away the ending, but I thought the final scene left you hanging without showing how the loose ends got resolved.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Well the book was a fantastic book and I just couldn't stop reading it once I started and I'm only ten so that really says something. So I can't wait to finish the rest of the series!
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Obviously one of the key selling points of this book was the authors standing as a brain surgeon of some repute and this someone that would seem more credible to the establishment.  He had heard many stories of people glimpsing the other side only to be pulled back into their bodies, but he gave these no credence until it happened to him personally.<br /><br />The book is written in a fashion that tries to create a sense of drama around the outcome.  Chapters alternate between his experiences in a coma and the medical and emotional journey of those around him.  As the outcome was never in doubt I did not find this approach effective in generating drama.<br /><br />For those that believe, or want to believe, in a life after death you will enjoy this book.  If you are reading it as a cynic I think there is still plenty of room, albeit less than most books on the topic, for you to feel unconvinced.<br /><br />My believability stumbling block was this.  The case was cited as &#34;unprecedented&#34; therefore all of the comparisons that were made to known science are invalid in my estimation.  Proof of Heaven it is not, but still one of the better books on the subject.
B009HEJXFS|4.0|I'm not a huge Men in Black fan.  I think they're okay, but my husband really likes them.  The original more than the second one.  He also loves Tommy Lee Jones.  I personally love Josh Brolin and he does an outstanding imitation of Jones.  Not a great movie, but it was cute.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|Good mix of comedy and mystery. Characters are still developing as in any first season, but there is a lot of potential for the series. I hope they keep it up in the following seasons.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I absolutely loved it, and like the first two books in this trilogy, I couldn't put it down. There was a lot of pain, sadness and loss, but it was a good ending. I was so happy for what Katniss did to Coin, or history just would have repeated itself. Very good read.
B004L49K20|5.0|A MASTERPIECE! Duran Duran, one of my favorite bands of the '80s & among my all-time favorite bands, has put out a masterpiece after 25 years of failed attempts, in my book.  I loved, loved, loved the albums Duran Duran, Rio, and Seven and the Ragged Tiger, but after Seven and the Ragged Tiger every album was a disappointment.  A few songs here and there were good in each album.  That was it.  Until now!<br /><br />This album feels like Rio's follow-up, but very current.  As if Duran Duran had released an album between Rio and Seven and the Ragged Tiger, but fresh & full of elements of today.  Mark Ronson has done a brilliant job producing this album.  He has brought out the best of the melodies adding a lush, sexy, playful, and elegant feel to each song ---- which, in my opinion, was missing since 1987.<br /><br />I love this album and I think most fans of \\" '80s Duran Duran \\" will love it as well.  For me it was a great surprise to love a Duran Duran album after 25 years of \\"just OK\\" albums.
B008ASLK8A|5.0|I didn't like the original Sherlock movie very much.  I found that the story wasn't very cohesive.  But I absolutely loved this movie !  Great story and very enjoyable movie!  I couldn't recommmend the first movie, but this one I definitely do!
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|This CD by Susan Boyle is beautiful.  Her voice is crystal clear.  I had purchased one of her other CD's and I wasn't particularly impressed.  This one most definitely is &#34;the best&#34;.  The choice of music on it is really great.  I would highly recommend this CD.
B004UJTG6Q|4.0|I myself love Mark twain and love reading his stories. But this story is and has been changed immensely from the original
B009KYXEY6|5.0|Lana del Rey was an acquired taste for me.  Early this year I was slightly drawn to her songs and by the end of the year I absolutely loved her.<br /><br />To begin, that voice is extraordinary --- one of the most dimensional and complex voices I have ever heard.  Although her voice is absolutely original and unique, for short moments it can remind me of Fiona Apple (for example in Million Dollar Man and Body Electric), or Sinead O'Connor (for example in Burning Desire), or the underlying \\"crying\\" in Agnetha Faltskog and Connie Francis' voice (for example in Blue Velvet and Without you), or Pat Benatar (on the \\"falsetto bridge\\" of Ride), and even Edith Piaf (listen to how she sounds when she sings \\"Baby can you see through the tears\\" and in most of the verses of Blue Jeans).  At times I can even hear in her voice the pitch and tone of a \\"singer from Bollywood\\" (strongly in Lolita and Off to the Races)!  Her voice can be edgy and entertaining one moment, incredibly romantic and chanteuse-like another moment; it can be comedic, it can be sarcastic; it can also break just at the right moment and become vulnerable and full of beautiful sensitivity (very much so in Ride, Without You, Video Games, and American).  It can be cool (for example in Diet Mountain Dew, and Cola) and with strong traces of soul.  It can be extremely sexy (for example in Born to Die and National Anthem).  It can be smoky and dark in a light sort of way (for example in Gods and Monsters), it can simply be gorgeous like in Without You, Dark Paradise, Lucky Ones, and the intro. of Radio.  I could go on and on about her voice.<br /><br />On top of her voice there is her songwriting --- it is brilliant!  WOW!  With flourishing melodies rarely found this day and age --- melodies that could have been written in the 50s or 60s by the elite songwriters of the time, but which she weaves with 2012 relevance and edge --- notes inside melodies that can sometimes make one feel nostalgic, romantic, happy, sad, and ecstatic in the span of a few seconds.  Simply brilliant!  A classic.  An album that gets better with time and one smoothly learns to adore.d ecstatic in the span of a few seconds.  Simply brilliant!  A classic.  An album that gets better with time and one smoothly learns to adore.
B006GHA9QQ|4.0|Although I did not love this movie as much as the Phantom movie, I did enjoy the storyline and some of the songs do stay with me afterwards.  I did like the actress who plays Christine, but I didn't like the phantom's mask design.  It covers his whole nose and looks odd.  I did enjoy this movie.
B001A3AA0G|4.0|I give this album 4 stars because it sounds good. The songwriting,  layering of harmonies, and cool little guitar parts are great. The reason I don't personally give this a fifth star is that, prior to purchasing, I had only ever heard White Winter Hymnal... and that being so, my expectations for the rest of the album were very high. Now, after listening through the album several times, WWH remains by far my favorite track. Ipso Facto, the rest of the album is a very small &#34;let down&#34; by comparison. If I could quantify just how small that let down is... I'd say it's about the size of a rating star. All in all, a great 4 star album.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|I loved this book because it made me feel like a child again and the movie was good two bye.
B007EDCWHA|5.0|My daughter loves one direction, she can not get enough of this book. It is popular and is a page turner,
B009NQKPUW|3.0|My daughter wanted me to watch this with her.  She loves the Alien movies and recommended this.  I can't say I was too impressed with it.  It was a little hard to know what was going on sometimes, because it wasn't addressed.  The only scene that really got to me was when the woman removed the alien from her womb.  That was pretty intense and she was pretty tough!  In conclusion, I could have gone without seeing it and never missed out.
B0011Z7JRU|5.0|That was the title of the email from Amazon, prompting me to log in and give my two cents. Even in it's simplicity, I was blown away by that question's audacity. How can you rate such a great album by means of a star system? This is one of my favorite albums of all time here! I could give you a long winded and verbose argument about why it's so great, but I'll spare you that. Just know that this album rocks. Hard.
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|Love the new birds and themes, both me and my 6 year old have been challenged and entertained. Still trying to figure out what all they can do!
0761169253|5.0|I bought this book from Dolly's Bookstore in Park City, but I wish I would have bought it here on Amazon, for it is significantly cheaper. But I still do not regret in the least my purchase. I've been in a sort of creative rut, and this book not only brought me out of it, but taught me how to balance and clarify my ambitions. A very inspiring and visually pleasing book.
B0086DBE62|3.0|The movie had some enjoyable moments and some just plain silly ones.  The hardest part for me was the first 30 minutes, because I couldn't stop staring at Snow Whites humongous eyebrows!
B005GG0MIS|5.0|This book gives an interesting insightful look into the presidents. Even though it's a history lesson, it's written like a novel and is hard to put down once you start.
0316069434|3.0|If you have not read Harry these books you are lucky because you can start at the beginning and enjoy one of the best crime/detective series ever. Micheal Connelly is like a machine turning these out and his publicity outstrips anything thing I have seen. Unfortunately, every machine needs and overall and The Black Box indicates one is due here. The main character is usually introspective, idiosyncratic and involved in several sub stories surrounding the main one. Here Harry is just a figure to propel the story forward. Perhaps it could be someone other than Harry altogether. It's a good yarn but Harry has become generic.
B005LAII80|4.0|Awesome action, great special effects.<br /><br />I'm writing this to let you know that there ARE special features, contrary to Amazon's listing.<br /><br />Mega-City Masters: 35 Years of Judge Dredd (HD; 14:27) is a really good (if kind of brief) retrospective of the franchise, including interviews with co-creators John Wagner and Carlos Ezsquerra, artist Brian Bolland, 2000AD's Matt Smith, among others. In the &#34;if you can't say anything nice, don't say anything at all&#34; category, this focuses solely on the comic and steers clear of the Stallone vehicle.<br /><br />Day of Chaos: The Visual Effects of Dredd (HD; 15:21) is a nice look at the cool VFX featured in the film and includes interviews with Neil Miller, Visual Effects Art Director and Jon Thum, Visual Effects Supervisor. There's some interesting information on a new handheld 3D camera that was utilized for the film's extreme close-ups, as well as the highspeed (over 3000fps!) that did the &#34;slo-mo&#34; SFX.<br /><br />Dredd Featurette (HD; 1:53) is really little more than a gussied up trailer.<br /><br />Dredd's Gear (HD; 2:31) takes a look at things like costumes and props.<br /><br />The 3rd Dimension (HD; 2:00) features interviews with Producer Andrew MacDonald, Cinematographer Anthony Dod Mantle and Lead Stereographer Vincent E. Toto.<br /><br />Welcome to Peachtrees (HD; 2:33) focuses on the &#34;megablock&#34; where the bulk of the film takes place.<br /><br />Dredd Motion Comic Prequel (HD: 2:57) gives us some backstory on supervillain Madeline and the slo-mo drug.<br /><br />Theatrical Trailer (HD; 2:30)
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|This show is great the actors are perfect!  I thought the first season was good but the second continues to impress.
B0085P2Z6E|4.0|It kept me interested with the diverse puzzles.  I enjoyed the different characters.  They kept it challenging by mixing various puzzles.
B0047WJ12K|5.0|I saw this in the theatre when it came out.  Literally from beginning to end, I was captivated and and drawn in by the Nolan's intricate story plot.  The acting, especially from Leonardo DiCaprio and Joseph Gordon-Levitt was superb.  The story and the it's many layers were very well woven, and there was certainly a message not only about who we relate to each other but how social relations are often connected to economic mobility and political currency.  Nolan's other films (Following and Memento) are always interesting but seem to require at least a second viewing, and Inception was no exception.  Fortunately, like the previously mentioned films, Inception was worth watching again.
B009PK9SB8|4.0|The ability to review video and photos via the LCD bacpac was the most important thing for me - going for a ride you can position your hero3 in any position you want to via the Smartphone app but this doesnt give you any indication of the lighting and how well the video is captured whilst in motion eg - is protune and 1080p 30fps in wide going to be the best for the environment I'm in?  etc .. easy - take out your lcd screen attach to the back of camera or leave it attached and review footage at whatever time mid ride without a need for the pc - so the whole ride can be captured correctly.  This screen isnt spectacular by any means but it is good enough, adjusting the camera settings by touch screen is also easier the package includes several case backings so touch screen is usable while in the case... plenty of options. The touch screen can take a little getting use to and is a slight delay in accessing files and replaying videos etc but once it plays can watch everything quite clearly.<br /><br />I did a bit of a check on this item and most forums report there are compatibility issues for other Hero cameras so I'd would only recommend this for Hero3  - all functions work perfectly. NOTE - if planning on using the screen for extended playback out in the middle of nowhere take a spare battery with you as the LCD drains the battery fairly quickly.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I've been withe the game since the PC alpha, and I've supported it since. I love this game and I always will. You go Mojang!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I love Colleen Hoover's books but this is by far my favorite. I literaly couldn't put it down until I finished the last page.
B00A80SHFM|3.0|I loved this CD!  For the songs it DOES give you, it is like seeing the movie again!  You hear the crying.  You feel the same passionate signing.<br />The problem is, it is like seeing only PART of the movie!  Both of Gavroche's songs are omitted.  \\"Lovely Ladies\\" isn't there!  And \\"Who Am I?\\"  I am so disappointed because it seems, as of January 6, 2012, there is no full soundtrack of the movie.
B004LOMB2Q|3.0|Says update is available and &quot;click here&quot;, but nothing happens.  What gives?  How do you install updates on the Kindle Fire?
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Fun! Simple but brain challenging.  Like that there are multiple levels and puzzle sizes which will keep me playing for a long time.
B005ZOCF5E|4.0|Another excellent book by an interesting author. It is good to read science based sci-fi for a change. Starts off slow but a great plot and interesting characters with a mystery that drives the story.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|This story, although a trick within itself, is truly eye opening. It took me a while to understand some things about the concepts, but despite that I truly liked it. It made me cry, yes, but it didn't actually make me feel anything more than hopeful that I can make my choices and feel the way I do about who I want to. I have the option  to take in what this book has told me in a positive way. So I will.
B005G5PPGS|4.0|Great book capturing the essence of the game and presenting compelling thoughts about the effort it takes to think of old things in New ways.
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|This music just makes you want to get up and dance!  I love it!  Some of the words are for adults only.  Bruno knows how to sing and make you feel good!  Love it!
B008VBYN80|5.0|I like this game but I don't love it.  I love building games.  I'm not a big fan of games where you have to fight but this one is not too bad.  I think anyone who likes building games and fighting games would like this.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I Enjoyed this app very much.  You can play the free portion enough to be very interested, then you have to buy the rest for 2.99 if you want to finish finish the story.
B007ZGBZHE|4.0|Another Pendegast thriller....  story line is a bit beyond reality but then that is what to be expected..<br />Two Graves is a takeoff on the classic advice on seeking revenge....ie, dig 2 graves ... one for the<br />person upon whom revenge is sought and the second for the one seeking revenge.. A bit different<br />from previous Pendegast tales is that Pendegast is personaly the centerpiece of the story..  not just<br />the investigator.
1451695195|4.0|It is a scientifically based inspiring book that is well written and offers insight to our spiritual afterlife. I highly recommend it.
B00197POXG|5.0|We miss this show a lot.  This is a great collection and the box set is fun to have.  HIGHLY recommended.
B001HZK8FY|1.0|The DVD does not play at all wtf did this company send me. Why do I have a movie that does not play and I tried it on more than one DVD player too and still nothing such a rip off and I will be contacting the company directly a out this issue!
B001AQO3QA|5.0|I don't typically buy re-issues because most of the time they're minimal investment maximize profit uprez conversions.  However over the holidays Amazon was basically giving Anthology away ($20) so I decided to impulse buy and I'm glad that I did.  The work done to produce a high quality, high definition version of all the Aliens movies really shows in this product. I've watched all the movies again and I was seeing set details that I had never seen before and picked up on a lot of other random details also never seen before.<br /><br />So much praise has already been written in detail about this package by others.  I'll just conclude with I'm blown away with the quality of these re-issues and any Aliens fan needs to own this package.
0671449028|5.0|Not only is this book a fun read for little ones but I had fun reading it too.<br />It's a very cute rhyme story.
B00913DPW2|5.0|The Haunt is an excellent game with a spooky atmosphere and lots of puzzles. There are a few puzzles that are more tedious than entertaining, but the vast majority are very enjoyable. I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a decent challenge. I can't wait to play the sequel.<br /><br />Note: This is an adventure game, not a hidden object game. The difference between the two genres is that adventure games incorporate the hunt for items into a larger game that is centered around exploration and puzzles whereas HOGs involve finding long lists of items on each screen (most of which have no connection to anything else in the game) and the exploration and puzzle solving, if even present, are an afterthought. It seems some of the people who left negative reviews were not aware of this.  Many people who like hidden object games also enjoy adventure games, and a few games blur the line between the two, but while The Haunt does have lots of objects to find, it definitely falls on the adventure side.
B007ZGBZHE|3.0|Thought it might come to some conclusion. Seems the authors intend to continue with FBI Agent Pendergast.  Not the best of their books.
B009NH9IMM|5.0|Finally picked up the Nightmare Blu Ray box set. This is the first time I've bought the series since the inital DVD box set release well over 10 years ago.<br /><br />Picked this up on sale for $30 at Best Buy. A fantastic deal for a killer set of movies. Blu Ray quality is about right what you would expect from a Nightmare release. This isn't remastered like a Spielberg classic, but it's a big upgrade from my 12 year old DVDs. The sound is good from what I've heard so far.<br /><br />The biggest surprise for me was the new doc which was narrated by Robert Englund in his Freddy voice! It was fantastic. Not very long, and not as good as the doc in the DVD set (can't remember what is was called) but it was fun seeing something new with Wes and Robert being interviewed. Also as an extra you get two episodes of Freddy's Nightmares! Pretty unmemorable episodes, but fun just seeing the show again.<br /><br />If you are a Nightmare fan the set is definitely worth the upgrade if you can find it at a fair price!
B009MCRHH6|5.0|I really enjoy this game! It seems physics-based games are either &#34;meh&#34; (most) or fantastic and well done (few).  Happily, WoG falls in the latter group.  I hope they make a second edition!
B001ANSSDC|3.0|Didn't care for Tiffany always giving pat false hope and her always being so secretive and demanding ....wished for a better ending and was hoping for a breakthrough with Pat 's father.
B003Y5H5HO|4.0|I'm a fan of \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\" trilogy of books, and the original film trilogy. I didn't expect to like the American version as much as I did. I still prefer the Swedish film version, but this installment is very good as a stand-along film. Daniel Craig is awesome, and while Rooney Mara's portrayal of Lisbeth Salander is drastically different than Noomi Rapace's, she makes the character her own and does a fine job. I am looking forward to the next two films.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Loved the quips and one- liners! The vocals were great, as well. Reminded me of my daughter's college acapella experience.
0812993292|4.0|THIS IS A REVIEW OF THE AUDIOBOOK<br /><br />The title pretty much says it all. One day, an older gentleman named Harold Fry decides--unexpectedly and without any prior planning-- to walk across England to say goodbye to an old friend, who has just written him to tell him that she is dying. Harold's journey is definitely unlikely (he is not one for grand gestures ... or even walking, for that matter) and certainly a pilgrimage (defined as \\"a journey or search of moral or spiritual significance\\"). Going in, I expected this to be a quirky, charming little story without much depth. Although it starts off in this vein, it quickly takes on much more depth and breadth than I ever expected. I was amazed at the skill with which Rachel Joyce wove her tale--adding in layers of complexity and depth and emotion that ended up making this novel one of the most emotional I've read this year. By the end, I was deeply moved by Harold and Maureen's story--much more than I ever expected. Jim Broadbent did a masterful job of narrating; you can tell he has acting experience because he brings Harold to life, with all his doubts, humility, regrets and spiritual questioning. Don't be fooled by the simple little cover and the quirky title. This is a novel of great depth and complexity, and it will get under your skin in a most unexpected way.
B009KKLQVS|4.0|The main issue I can see everyone is having is the tracklisting. It should be noted Mike Love is credited as Executive Producer. Unlike most of the Boys' fandom however, I believe he too is an integral part of the band,(No one really messes with John for killing the Beatles, everyone seems to blame Yoko or simply hail him as the genius of the band). You can clearly tell the concert is composed mostly of songs which Mike took part in composing or writing, or were released when he still had some creative power over the band and before Brian steered the band in new directions, except for two (yes, TWO) Pet Sounds songs, and TWO songs from SMiLE/Smiley Smile. I loved the overall product however, one can see the Boys' have fun (Brian even smiles some times :) ) My only complain (like pretty much all of them) is the tracklisting. I don't accuse any of the included songs of being bad/dissapointing, I enjoy pretty much all of the Boys' catalogue, and think they should've AT LEAST included the live renditions of Forever (Sunflower, 1970) and God Only Knows (Pet Sounds, 1966) considering they were tributes to Dennis and Carl Wilson. I would also of liked to see some more from albums that are generally ignored by the public, such as 1977's Love You (a wonderful record, in my opinion). I would also of loved to see more SMiLE live renditions, and think I would've gone broke had the Boys' planned on touring playing it entirely.

0316228532|4.0|I kind of feel bad for J.K. Rowling. She had phenomenal success and garnered millions of fans worldwide with her wonderful Harry Potter series. (And, I might add, she had the courage and willingness to end it after seven books instead of going on and on like some authors and ruining a perfectly good series.) So now, when she dares to write a completely different kind of book (a Muggle book about Muggles doing Muggle stuff), I don't think she's getting a fair shake because it is almost impossible to read this book without thinking of the Harry Potter books. As HP fans will quickly realize, this is nothing like the Harry Potter books. (I think my friend said it best when she said \\"it's a book about the Dursleys.\\" If Harold, Shirley and  Miles Mollison couldn't pass for Vernon, Petunia and Dudley Dursley, I'll eat my hat.) So let's forget Harry Potter and talk about this book.<br /><br />The book starts with the death of Barry Fairbrother (which brings about a \\"casual vacancy\\" on the parish council). The rest of the book focuses on the fallout from Barry's death and the maneuverings to fill his vacant seat. Moving from character to character (and there are lots of characters), Rowling takes us into the hearts and minds of the various citizens of Pagford--from its teenagers (Crystal, Fats, Sukhvinder, and Andrew) to its grown-ups (Miles, Samantha, Kay, Gavin, Tessa, Harold, Shirley, Parminder). The plot is relatively simple (how will the vacancy on the parish council be filled?) yet also intricate and complex. Every little thing that happens builds on something else, and, at the end, Rowling weaves all the pieces together masterfully. It isn't a happy, fun or uplifting book. It is set squarely in a world where things don't always work out, people fail each other, and relationships aren't always satisfying. But, for all the misery and anger and cruelty in the book, I saw moments of hope and forgiveness and growth. Personally, I liked the  book and was never bored by it. I could see why people who read this book solely because of their love of Harry Potter might be intensely disappointed. It is nothing like the HP books, but it is a good read on its own merits. So, if you can forget everything you already know about J.K. Rowling and go into this book with an open mind, you might find a novel worth reading. I know I did.I could see why people who read this book solely because of their love of Harry Potter might be intensely disappointed.

B006P96PAO|5.0|There is just something to be said about this kind of feel good movie.  I do not get emotional very often but this film was able to produce a tear or two.  This is definitely a great movie and one that I would recommend to others as we..

0062124293|5.0|Hello. I'd like to introduce you to my new literary BFF, Caitlin Moran. Last year, after listening to Bossypants, I thought I wanted to be BFFs with Tina Fey. However, after reading this book, I decided to switch to Caitlin because she's freaking hilarious, fearless and talks about womanhood in the most down-to-earth and life-affirming way I've ever read. I love her! I agree with her! I admire her! I think she's simply fabulous, and I want you to get to know her too. (However, if you're not down with some potty language, Caitlin might not be your cuppa as she doesn't shy away from a good old-fashioned curse word.) I really admire her openness (the chapter on her decision to have an abortion was fearless) and her take on feminism and what it means to be a woman in today's world. I'm sure she's not for everyone, but I just loved her to pieces--so much so that I'm currently reading her latest book, Moranthology, which is a collection of her columns from The Times. If the idea of \\"Tina Fey, Chelsea Handler, and Lena Dunham all rolled into one\\" (Marie Claire) sounds like a woman you'd like to get to know, then get this book immediately!

B006CQLGXG|5.0|A timeless classic.  I've seen just about every movie version of this story that has ever been made.  Some are better than others.  This was the first time I read the original story by Charles Dickens.  Many of the film versions follow the dialogue of the book quite well.  There are a few English words that we no longer use, but the built in dictionary on my Kindle was helpful--most of the time.  This is a great read that every Christmas Carol movie buff should read.  It is a timeless story that never grows old no matter how many times it is read or performed.

B000QRIGLC|5.0|A definitely a must read book to anyone who wants a real life thriller. Definitely a very motivational book. I look forward to Marcus luttrell book Service
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|This collection is a fun set leaving you wanting more. Fun, funny and exiting. A great grouping and good character interaction!
B005LAIHR2|4.0|I love this movie so my 4 stars are because the regular DVD does not have the extras that apparently the Blu-ray does.  I wanted to see the deleted scenes- some of which are alluded to in the trailer, but they are not on this version.  Still great movie.
1451695195|5.0|Very easy to read and well written.  The way the author intermingles his experience with the ongoing activities 'during' his experience, makes the story have great flow.  Good book.
B009VL28W2|5.0|I relieve the night I was there. The sound is great, better than when I saw in in 2009.<br />Great Show!
B005OCFHHK|5.0|The movies all worked great.  Having them in one neat package at a good price was a nice bonus to have.
B000IZA9NU|1.0|I did not like the plot of this movie and some of the actors did not do a good job!
B009WO7NQO|3.0|Fun game, but I am unable to download the updates to my Kindle. The Hoth world will not download. If I can figure it out it would be great.
B007T99ENE|4.0|It is very well done - from the literature's point of view. Not exactly entertaining, though. Some parts are rather boring.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Great movies and 3 for this price was awesome.  The movies were of great quality and any time I can get packaged movies for this great of a price, I am thrilled
B0086700CM|5.0|Temple Run is awesome, not only is it addicting and competitive, but also brain challenging, it test your reactions. I love it.
B004LWZWGA|5.0|I bought this for my roommate. We all love this movie. I saw it about 3 or 4 times in theaters and absolutely love the series. I'm sorry it's over.
B009O07NBQ|5.0|Love this soundtrack, it's amazing. Well worth the price, and it came really fast! And I didn't even know it had two discs!
B000H6SXMY|5.0|No problem with the DVDs.  I was excited to get such a good price for so many shows - it could have been more expensive.
B009NPA3MS|5.0|Such an excellent artist.  His songs havew a ring of 'down home' wholesomeness that I love.  I would recommend this cd to everyone!
B008I43DYU|5.0|Works perfect!, and the resolution is wonderful. For those with apple device, is the same app. The fire hd doesn't came with one, so a totally recommend it.
B001CC7PP8|4.0|But I'm looking forward to! It arrived very fast, great service! Didn't even realize it had two discs! :D Very cool.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|A great end to the trilogy.  I did not want it to end.  It kept you on your toes throughout the entire book, and ended perfectly... minus one thing, but I don't want to spoil it for anybody.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|it is a wonderfully written book, a true cliffhanger.<br />a story perfectly blended with love, betrayal, shock, and violance. i recomend this to all book lovers.
0553212737|4.0|We had to compare this book and the movie Clueless for a college class of mine and I needed a copy for it.
0316227706|5.0|as a dog lover it was my kind of book.I have had 2 golden retreivers who loved to jump in the pool so seeing all the dogs going underwater was great.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|It might be total smut but I love this book non the less! I can't wait to read the next book! :)
B004I8WD6E|3.0|The case looks more comical than in the picture.  It feels great but it makes it look like something a child would use.<br /><br />The screen protector is great.
0312305060|3.0|I got this DVD for a class I was taking and had to compare this with another story. The movie was alright, nothing I would go to the movies and go see. Just not my cup of tea but English enthusiasts will enjoy it.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Hopeless by Collen Hoover is one if the sweetest, heart-wrenching, squeal inducing, tummy fluttering, tear-jerking teenage romance novel I have read in a long while. Brilliantly executed. I really hope this novel gets far out there. People should read this book.
B0096PYUE2|2.0|Attempted to view downloaded camera video on my Kindle Fire HD.  Prompt read that I needed 'Flash' to view, so I downloaded this app.  Still unable to view!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I've been a Wool lover for a year now, and absolutely love this series. Hugh Howey is a terrifically talented author, and deserves all of the accolades he's receiving. I've pushed his work onto several friends and family members, and they've all thanked me for it.<br /><br />I need more! More Jules! More Solo! :) Thanks, Hugh. It's so great.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|My sister liked this a lot. She went and saw the broadway show last here and listens to the CD almost every day.
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|i like the game but it sure does freeze and lockup on you. not cool and there is no way to reset the game.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome and even better it's free!! I recommend you get this game. Everyone who plays this game with me loves it and they go get this app!!!! 5 STAR MATERIAL! !!!!!!!!!!!!!
B005LAJ23A|5.0|Anyone who likes the TV series should have a copy of this. Blu-Ray is the best to buy for picture quality.
B002RI9UBS|3.0|Only up to chapter 20. Nothing of intertest has happened in the story yet. just telling me about animals and religion. VERY SLOW STORY.
B0041KBWM0|5.0|I never cared much for classics till I became classic. I didn't appreciate pride and prejudice and probably wouldn't have even understood it had they not came out with an updated version on dvd. I enjoyed the movie so much I was encouraged to read the book that I would have never read in high school. I enjoyed and actually found myself understanding the writing and characters. I have watched everything I can put my hands on by Jane Austin including the different versions of Emma. I love how this young lady portrays her so emotionally. She is a little on the spoiled side but is put in her place real quick by her beloved friend whom she doesn't even realize she has feelings for till it smacks her in the face. Her match making finds her and others in trouble but in the end everyone is joined happily as they should be. I just wish Jane were still alive so we could have more clean classical entertainment. I am a romantic but not a rated R one.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I absolutely loved this story. Many times I felt like was living it through the author. A must read for anybody willing to open their minds to our history.
B0091REZMW|4.0|new app for me on my new Kindle fire! very fun, but will definitely take time to understand and to be really competitive.
B0091LS07E|3.0|no as good as i expected from her at this point in her career. girl on fire is a bit lame too
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I thought this game was AWESOME!  I loved the graphics, the story line was easy to follow and it melt me interested. I did get stuck a few times and the hint and guide book helped A LOT. I also liked not having to find all the hidden objects before moving on. The Monaco addition was great.  The only con I have is that the company labels this game as free when it's really not. Just be upfront about the cost and let the customer decide if they want to purchase or not.
B00A77II0U|5.0|This game was both intriguing and remarkable!!! It was fairly easy to determine your next step and the story line and graphics were completely fantastic!!! I was so pleased at this game!!! It was absolutely worth every penny!!! I recommend this game to anyone who love's a classic mystery game or even a thrilling horror story. Two thumbs up!!!
B005H0IW76|4.0|Songs were very good doing his version of those Christmas classic music. Would by it again and recommend it highly.
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|Graphics are much better than older versions.  There are some glitches were the meters for food and boost are at full strength and do not deplete.  The game will still let you play and starving will flash like it is supposed to.  You just do not know how much is replenished when you start eating.
B005LAIIA8|5.0|Do you think it will drop below $29 on the day of the release? Aren't new 3D realeases $24 the first week?
B008FYZIVY|5.0|good show, this was on sale, great bargain for 2 seasons<br /><br />love Dame Maggie Smith in anything she does !
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I love the fact it lets me know the percentage of battery life I have in my kindle;so that I can keep track of when I need to recharge.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book is a perfect insight to the average life of a teenager trying to fit in high school and discovering himself. From the first page until the last page I remained attached to both Charlie and the other characters as well as their triumphs and struggles. Overall an excellent book with a great storyline, which I highly recommend to other readers.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This is one of the first apps I downloaded for my Kindle, and it's one of my most used.  It is easy to use, and very helpful.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Well written. Good character development. Kept me on the edge of my seat. Could not put the book down. Ready for more!
B005HSG3VK|3.0|This is a great concept, but I think the one that I got is faulty. I gave it to my mom on Christmas and the edges are fraying by Jan 6th on the inside fabric cover. I am hoping I just recieved a faulty one. I intend to contact customer service and see about getting a replacement. I love that there is a fold out back and the strap for the cover is very convienient. I like it enough to hope mine was a oops and try another one.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book is amazing. It really lets you focus in the more important things in life. It really makes you want to change something
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Sure its fiction, but these things did happend.  Though personally, I would have stretched the wars years strories for another series.
B008R14YBK|5.0|My teenage daughter loves Bridgit from all her TV activities and loves her songs.  Good CD - my daughter really enjoys it
0545265355|3.0|The book was okay. More geared to the younger kids and not adults. I would not recommend these books to adult friends but perhaps to the younger children I know.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|It has been a long, long time since I have enjoyed a book as much as I did \\"The Martian.\\"  5 stars do not do it justice.  I hope to ready many more books from this author in the future (the sooner the better).  After spending way too much money with Amazon (on books and merchandise), this is the 1st review I have ever done.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Plenty of British flair packed into about 6 minutes.  The Turkish bit had me in stitches everytime.  This will catch you up in a hurry.
B005OZE9SA|4.0|Needed to begin recording into my Dell laptop...had a few problems because I was plugging it into an usb 3 port, which was advertised as being backwards compatible, but didn't seem to be true with this device. When I got it plugged into a usb 2 port, everything worked as advertised. I got acceptable lag times while recording into my DAW...easily within the range that I could play along with recordings in real time and not notice the difference. 7-8 ms if I remember correctly.  I did appreciate the direct line in switch...I could hear exactly what was being played into the unit without having to route through the computer. That was a nice feature. More recently, I was very happy to get this working with my ipad mini. I did purchase a recommended usb powered hub Belkin model &#34; F4U020&#34; and with that - I'm good to play music into and out of my ipad. I got stereo in and stereo out...A good low cost option (with powered usb hub) to begin playing stereo music into an ipad.<br /><br />Build quality is high, all metal construction feels solid, switches and knobs all feel comfortable and sturdy.<br /><br />Works for me.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|This was a very good book, as John Grisham's books usually are. The only thing that disappointed me, was that I suspected about 2/3. s of the way through, that Quinn and Max were in cahoots. Kept me wanting to keep reading until I was finished. Hated to lay the book down.
B006C67NP6|5.0|I love Jazz standards. This app has helped me learn some of my favorites and even some new ones. It also helps as I try to learn how to do jazz improvisational since it will play through the chart with drums, piano/guitar, bass. You are able to alter the volume of each of the instruments as well. I've read that some use this to do live gigs if they don't have a live band with them. It's a great feature and wonderful when practicing both the chart, and any lead.  Some have down rated this app because it doesn't include lyrics or melody line. There is a reason for this that, perhaps most, musicians know: Lyrics and Melody lines are copyrighted. Chord progressions do not have copyrights. If the lyrics/melodies were included, I'm sure the price of this app would be much higher.  I recommend this app to those who want to get rid of the big binders of music or those who want to have a convenient way to practice.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|I love this movie and it was for a fair price, so if you are a Brave fan but don't want to pay for all the extras other dvds bring, then you should buy this.
B0091REZMW|3.0|If you want to get anywhere you have to buy diamonds with real money.  Takes a long time for your energy to build up on its own.  Higher you go in the game the longer it takes to reenergize.  Items you need to advance take a long time to acquire.
B008L1DNGI|5.0|Please tell me if enough people buy this, Sega will bring MORE DREAMCAST EXCLUSIVES TO AMAZON! I want Crazy Taxi, I want Jet Grind Radio! Ooga Booga would be great with internet play!<br /><br />Anyways, ChuChu is simple, but tough. Just like a good puzzle game should be. The graphics while 12 years old, are still perfect for this game! Luckily the Dreamcast was way ahead of it's time.<br /><br />Just buy this game! Or go onto ebay and spend $50 for a dreamcast and another $8 for the ChuChu Rocket CD... Well, that wouldn't make much sense... nevermind.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|If you are following this series, then this is a must.  If not, it will probably leave you cold.  Pendergast is definitely an aquired taste.
B005KTZ05G|5.0|My son got this for christmas with all the other assassin guys,  he plays with all of then rough and tough and so far so good...they go in the swimming pool shower and bed - now that i think about it everywhere like i added 4 more kids to my plate much easier anyway perfect in everyway....
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|This game is great! Everybody should get it! Now I don't know if I want to kill the pigs in my angry birds games!
B005HEDI3K|4.0|I like all they have done to add to the show. I grew up watching the show an to see the new affects make it great.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|The book had an Implausible plot, and it was very poorly written and edited. Someone should tell the author and editor that Americans don't shout, &#34;Keep your hair on,&#34; it's &#34;Keep your shirt on,&#34; - even that is outdated, - and we keep our dishes in a kitchen cabinet, not a cupboard. (Well, maybe my grandmother kept hers in a cupboard.) As others have said, the author needed a good thesaurus, and her heroine needed therapy if she allowed herself to fall in love with this wacko and stay with him. If he hadn't been a gazillionaire she would never have given him the time of day. But what do I know? I've only been happily married for 38 years to a wonderful man who has never physically abused me. I read this book at the request of a young friend who had serious questions about it, and I have no desire to finish the series no matter what type of fairy tale ending the author concocted.
1451688091|5.0|It makes reading history almost like a novel.<br />The original documents on which the history is based make it exciting reading.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|Great game to play with your kids or by yourself. Some time frames to earn rewards and next levels are overboard. Is nice to turn game off and start in the same spot. Kids get bored after 10-20 minutes if now new levels or games open up.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|Good page turner.  I enjoy the series.  I was hoping that by the time I read this book that the final book would be out.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised by the first season of AHS, and the second season is even more enjoyable for me!  A lot of the actors from the first season play different roles in the second season.  But this season is wholly separate from the first season, with not connection to its storyline, mythology, etc. (unless that becomes another plot twist).<br /><br />This show is what would've happened if Tool's music videos from the late 1990's were turned into full length television episodes.  Artistic, creepy, and sadisticly funny.  Certainly not for the faint of heart!
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|My new puppy ate my cable connector, so I had to replace it.  The replacement is as good as the original.
B009JBZH54|4.0|Certainly a very entertaining twist on a childhood favorite. Glad to have this set in the Hero collection.  And,  the deal was the best on bluray!
B00448SE4S|1.0|I couldn't even get through the whole thing. Pure idiocy and horrible acting. SuperBad meets the cheesiest 80s movie you've ever seen.
B006LSZECO|5.0|The book started out slowly because I disliked both characters.  The further I got into the book the more I disliked them both but found the premise interesting enough to keep reading.  About a quarter of the way into it I thought I had it figured out - ha, more twists.  After 1/2 of the way through I was hooked - still dislike the characters intensely but now I can't wait to see what the end brings.
B000ATQYT2|5.0|I am a huge muppet fan and this movie is a fun version of the classic. Michael Caine plays a wonderful Scrooge.
B008F5YDRI|5.0|a very cute and clever love story. pretty amazing if it were true!! i highly recomend it!!even my husband like it.
0321857895|5.0|If you ever considered taking notes by sketching or had been fed up with writing down thousands of words that you hate to read later this book is for you. It will teach you why everyone can draw ideas and express thoughts by pictures. Every page is an illustration worth hanging on a wall. Mike Rohde is a true pioneer and pro in terms of sketchnotes!<br /><br />This is one of the best designed and published books I own.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|I have played the part of this game that is available for free, and I really like it.  I will probably end up buying it so I can play the full game on my Kindle Fire.  :)
B000VDDDVO|5.0|Love to watch this every year. One of my favorites for the holidays. A wonderful movie for the entire family.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I don't even read books yet i managed to read all three books of the hunger games i really enjoy reading<br />it did ruined the movie for me
B000HT3PPG|5.0|this is one of my favorite christmas movies of all time. i really love this movie and was very pleased with my purchase
B008K6HN8I|5.0|I wish I had this app two hours ago.  Prior to this app the only way to delete 500 duplicate audio files is one at a time.  This app is definitely worthy of its 4 7/8 star rating.  What a time and aggravation saver.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|One of my all-time favorite movies! Love the Griswold Family. Have to watch this movie every year. Is a Classic and is Hilarious!
B0063GORYU|4.0|A nice difference from regular solitaire. You can also increase difficulty levels as you improve. I recommend this nice free app.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game is just as addictive as the ones on the midway.  I really enjoy this game and it brings back happy memories!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Human graphics a little stiff.  Over all game was excellent and spooky.  It really held my interest and was well done.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This is a really great book. You cannot help but get involved with the characters, and honestly I read it for 3 days straight and was literally incapable of putting it down. Lesson learned in the end: playing games with the unknown leads to unknown outcomes. An excellent read, highly recommend.
0671449028|5.0|I love all of Sandra Boynton's books. Such a fun story.  Quick read before bed for my 7-month-old.  Love the illustrations and light-hearted.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I read it in 2 days. I just couldn't put it down!  The writing was superb and the plot thickened until the end - and here I sit with my mouth open, craving more!
B00A4YVHXQ|1.0|UNLESS YOU PLAY PIANO, THIS GAME IS WAY TO HARD FOR THE NON PIANO PLAYER. THANKS BUT NO THANKS! THIS GAME IS A REAL CHALLENGE!
B0085W6II8|5.0|Squire and Hackett deliver.  If you've been wondering whether it's any good, stop wondering and just get it.  You won't regret it.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is a must read! Couldn't put it down. Easy to read and we'll written. Great story line and setup.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|much to my surprise, this book is actually quite interesting. I recommend this book to people who enjoyed the movie \\"What Happens in Vegas\\"!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book was an excellently written riveting tale of both love and violence....I only wish there was a fourth book!!
B0086700CM|5.0|it is the most funist game ever and i would recomend this game to any one who likes weaird places
0439023513|4.0|I have mixed feelings about this book. This is in no small part due to the fact that I believe that Hunger Games could have been a brilliant stand-alone book, and that while the world still needed fixing and the love triangle was nowhere near resolved, Catching Fire and Mockingjay struggle with sequelitis.<br /><br />This aside I must commend Collins for reinventing the premise and perpetually throwing Katniss crazier and crazier curveballs to keep the story going. In Mockingjay Katniss finds herself working for district 13 (no prawns) in rebellion against the capitol. The stakes are high, the violence brutal and the twists genuinely surprising.<br /><br />My only real criticism of the book is that while conflict ridden and packed with tension, Mockingjay lacks the same character driven emotional punch of Hunger Games. While book one saw Katniss' bravery grow from challenging the system to outright defiance. Katniss in Mockingjay presents throughout as an exhausted action hero. Kick-ass but not nearly as compelling. Maybe this is no problem for fans who have securely attached to our heroine - however I suspect despite being a fitting end to the trilogy, Mockingjay lacks the authorly craftsmanship of the beginning of the series.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|It's been a long time since I've read  book that has made me feel such a large range of emotions. Great read.
B005FMZWD8|5.0|First off, I would like to say that I have never worn a watch prior to this one. I am 22 and have always just used my cell phone for time, BUT when I saw this watch at 99 dollars, I couldn't resist! I will admit, I got it mostly because I love the style of it. The blue face with silver casing sold me right away. I do have to say it is bigger than I expected, but it doesn't take away the fact that it looks really great. The picture doesn't do it enough justice! I like the dials being on the left side because I am a lefty and wear the watch on my left wrist. The cloth band is very durable and the interior is leather and very comfortable.<br />Bottom Line: This is a massive watch, keep in mind dials are on the left, but it's stylish as hell!
B000002UB4|5.0|I can listen to this tape and close my eyes. I am back in the 60's and wish the world had not changed since that time!!!<br />Great music and I miss the Beatles!!
B009JBZH54|5.0|Order was received before expected date and price was great! Definitely worth the purchase and I highly recommend buying the trilogy.
B006Z9SP3E|4.0|The story becomes predictable.. but since the first part of the Clifton Chronicles was quite enthralling, I wanted o know what happens.. Waiting for the third book now.
0596806027|2.0|what I am really looking for is an html5 book which lists at least the possible values for ALL the elements (not just what's in use now) and of course, the elements,what they do. it would be a big book. but I think I and everybody else would buy it! problem is, it might have to be based on the whatwg.org HTML5 standard,which unfortunately is copyrighted and has a (very liberal) license. I was unable to use this as a reference,which is what I am looking for.
B009Y2KGSQ|5.0|While this may not be my favorite Aerosmith album ever it lived up to all of the hype for me.
0756405890|5.0|Writing that grabs you and locks you in. Even when the action is slow the story is compelling. Fantasic work
B0025KVLV0|4.0|The initial intent behind this project was novel and, if achieved, this could have been the anti-Sgt.Pepper record they had been aching to do. From \\"Yeah Yeah Yeah\\" through \\"I'd Love to Turn You On\\" straight on through \\"The Love You Take is Equal to the Love You Make\\", the Beatles kept changing course until their ugly divorce. This is due to them being a collective visionary and you know you get better results through cooperation. However, excepting Paul, nobody else showed much alacrity during these sessions. And it's for this that Billy Preston comes on board as way more than just an adjunct bandmate. His keyboard wizardry and the person himself are such a valued presence. He earns the distinction that of fifth (or sixth) Beatle.<br /><br />Another first, Phil Spector attends to the details instead of steadfast George Martin. Except for the treacle that informs \\"The Long and Winding Road\\" (strictly personal opinion), these are decent songs. And only on this cut and on \\"Across the Universe\\" do Phil's production skills sound overblown and apropos of nothing.<br /><br />George gets in some fine blues licks on \\"I, Me, Mine\\" and John highlights \\"Get Back\\" with his guitar solo. But it's the three great tracks that elevate this project's level of meaning. And all three of these are backwards-looking, both musically and lyrically. With the gospel \\"Let It Be\\" comes Paul's major confessional of spiritual longing accompanied by his rich vocal and piano hook. On a holdover from their Quarrymen days, \\"One After 909\\", they muster up all the verve they had in their Hamburg and Cavern Club dates once more. You can sense their discovery and thrill of basic rock and roll. It could be in contention as the most addicting throwaway of their career. Best of all is the emotional enormity of the rustic \\"Two of Us\\". This gorgeous melody fuses togetherness and memory. Paul and John's Everly Brothers harmonies are every bit as luscious as anything they did on \\"Beatles For Sale\\". But it does seem so long ago, making it all the more poignant.<br /><br />Phil's interference deserves some thanks for including some studio and rooftop banter which extracts some of the charm and humor from the widening chasm within the group. More importantly, he hasn't hindered the music too much. As for the Beatles themselves, they broke up at the right time maybe in part because there was nowhere else for them to go. Dig this for what it is because this is it and they still shine a light as they're collapsing.seem so long ago, making it all the more poignant.<br /><br />Phil's interference deserves some thanks for including some studio and rooftop banter which extracts some of the charm and humor from the widening chasm within the group.

B000V8A31C|5.0|A beautiful soundtrack and highly recommend it. I received my order quickly as promised and will keep this on my 'will purchase again' list.
B00ADIT8U2|4.0|game was ok game worked good<br /><br />was a little hard to figure out some of the puzzles without any hints just wasnt the type of games that i like to play
0394800184|5.0|This book is great--my children and grandchildren have all loved it. PD Eastman's books are all great, but this is my favorite

B0028MBKVG|5.0|FANTASTIC STORY. MAKES YOU WANT TO SELL ALL YOUR POSSESSION S AND RUN IN THE DESSERT. SO HAPPY I READ THIS
B003VANOFY|2.0|Headset is comfortable and sound quality is fantastic right up until you find out this product suffers horribly of signal drop, i will lose connection and the headset will spend 20seconds reconnecting at least once every 10 minutes. This is an across the board problem this product, there are forums full of people who can only find short term fixes. Logitech itself is based out of country and completely untrained so expect a 20 minute wait for them to figure out how to even try to help you.In the end that said they had never heard of this problem before and had no explanation, when i asked if there was at least a way to make them run through the wire itself instead of running off the receiver they said no. This is the second product of logitech i've purchased that has signal drop problems, software problems(don't even want to talk about it now)and support problems.<br /><br />The product arrived quickly and in great condition though :)
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Needed to see what everyone is obsessed with playing Angry Birds, and now I get it. Graphics and &#34;flow&#34; of game are very smooth, found myself hooked quickly and enjoyed the bonding with my kids (ages 10-19) as they &#34;helped&#34; me through the tough ones.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I really loved this book . It was all you could ask for and more ! Wish there was more books !
B005SFS4ZU|5.0|I am a fan of Phantom and this is a must have.  Great performance and a great movie.  Obviously you need to know and understand Phanton to truly appreciate the performance but I did love it.
B000JBWWBK|5.0|It came on time and I enjoy it much. Hope to make more purchases from you also. Thanks a lot.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This is the best book out of the whole series ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !(Well to me)
B000N2HBSO|5.0|I had started reading this book before seeing the movie and couldn't wait to get back to it after that.  The book being too heavy to read in bed, I subsequently bought the Kindle edition--but I keep the book beside me for illustrations, maps, etc.  I wish the Kindle version had been better edited--so many words run together, for example.  But the story is mesmerizing. and I can't put it down.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|Harry Potter.  All Harry Potter movies.  In Blue-Ray.  Awesome!  Love it and nice, simple packaging to fit on the shelf.  Frees up alot of space.
B0007ZEO4G|5.0|Hey, it's Deep Purple.  What more is there to say?  Good organ, guitars, percussion, vocals, everything that made the band great.
B00004T9UF|5.0|Honestly, there's worse rappers out there who rap about worse things.  Some people take Eminem too seriously.  Younger people would be able to understand when Eminem is serious and when he is joking. On a different subject, this album was the first of its kind.  Songs like \\"Stan\\" prove rap isn't only about guns, gangs and sex.  It proved there can be poetry in rap, even if it is explicit and violent.  If you can look past the fact he uses explicit language frequently and understand where he came from, you will understand why he writes the stuff he does.  I feel people singled him out just because they had never heard or seen a white rapper.  By far, this is his best album.  A touch of both his personal life (The Way I Am, Drug Ballad) and some humor (The Real Slim Shady, Criminal) along with other subjects really brings this album together and separates it from the rest of the crowd.
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|If you liked Band of Brothers you will like this movie. It was nice to see a series that showed America in the Pacific during WWII. A great movie for any WWII buff to add to his or her collection
B001E5CH0G|5.0|One of my Christmas staples.  Love the movie and getting it on Blu-Ray was a bonus.  How can you not laugh and feel good after this movie?

B00A80SHFM|5.0|OMG! I love this love this.  JUst saw the movie and I just love love this.  Also got the play soundtrack.  That was awesome too.  You cannot go wrong with Les Miserable.  Still singing.
B000TVBIYC|3.0|Legos are one of the best toys for children.  They enhance creativity in children and are fun for all. I rate the toys themselves with the highest rating.<br /><br />This vendor appears to be honest, I can not say the same for another Amazon vendor who sold Lego products.  The other vendor practiced Christmas price gouging and I feel Amazon knowingly allowed them to do so.  It reflects poorly on Amazon and henceforth I will limit my shopping with them.<br /><br />Practice caveat emptor when dealing with Amazon and Amazon vendors.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I am NOT a Stephen King fan. He is an amazing writer with a vivid (mostly twisted) imagination but it's his usual genre I don't care for. This is a really good book!  I love the premise & agree that the ending was appropriate. Is it the ending I wanted?  Definitely not...but it was the only one that was right, for lack of a better word. Hats off to Mr. King, who has once again produced a gripping, heart racing story that just sucks you right in & blurs the line between literature and reality.
B004GUSG4M|4.0|I loved this book, the concept, the writing style, the twists....Everything.  Except the end.  I am dying to know what happens the next day!  Sequel, please!
B005SFR7YE|5.0|I've been a fan of \\"Phantom\\" since its NYC opening and have seen it 33 times on Broadway since then as well as 6 in London. This performance ranks among the best. I've Ramin Karimloo onstage and he's one of the best Phantoms. To make this Royal Albert Hall production work, they did have to use projections but I think they did it rather well given the limitations of the venue. I also missed the reassembling of the chandelier during the overture but not a problem.<br /><br />The one flaw in this is the video director's love of ultra closeups. Do we really need to see the singers' dental work and nose hairs?? Medium shots would've been quite enough.<br /><br />Recommended over the lousy movie version of Webber's Phantom.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Super game<br /><br />Graphics and audio are awesome one of the better g5 games I have played recently. Looking forward to new games of the same caliber.
0762439009|5.0|Great value in in this product for the number of items in it.  The rug alone is worth the price and I have gotten many complements on it at my work desk already.  It really ties the desk together.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|This was a soothing way to help me fall asleep.  I enjoyed like the many sound choices. I would recommend this app.
B0034G4P8A|5.0|This movie just makes you wanna work out after watching Chris Hemsworth.  Such a great performance from every actor and is really great on blu ray.
1610660242|5.0|I've read a lot of business autobiographies, and this is one of the best. Tony describes his life; taking us from his early schoolboy days up through his managing of Zappos. The anecdotes are fun and helpful, but what stuck with me was his life and business philosophy. In his personal life, he values experiences over money, and I found that very refreshing.<br /><br />Definitely would recommend this to anyone, regardless of background.
B0095T3H2U|4.0|good stuff.  Jason segel was very funny.  the movie had some of his usual crazy, zany comedy, but was somewhat predictable.  enjoyed it nonetheless.<br />thanks.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|It is a good story that keeps you hooked, want to know what happens next. It is nice when things go smoothly  for him, but you know something is around the corner.
B003L77GGU|5.0|I've watched supernatural since it came out and I've loved every season.  Kripke's story arc was great and Sera has kept things going.  New season is amazing
0316228532|3.0|This book is not Harry Potter. There is no magic, and no secret world. It is not a kids book, its an adult book. It is a town that could be very real with people that could be your neighbors.<br /><br />I liked this book. Was it my favorite book ever? No. But it was a good book. There are a lot of characters to remember and there is a lot of emotion in the book.I have loved Rowling from the moment I started reading HP. I love her fir many reasons, but one if the biggest is she makes you care about the characters and invest in them. She does that in this book too! Give it a chance and dont go into it hoping it will be Potter.
B00AMBK0X4|2.0|a little more raw than I expected.  I suppose I will have to be more conscious of the unrated label.  some funny parts, though.

B001TXWJ4M|5.0|This is such an amazing show, and an even better buy on blu ray.  If you're looking for a new show to watch, this is it.  Everything in this show, is perfectly executed thanks to Vince Gilligan and their two amazing lead actors.  I'm itching for it to come back in July 2013
1451695195|5.0|A must read for everyone in order to gain a better understanding of the Afterlife. This is a truly amazing explanation of where we go after we die.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Love the format of the book.  The alternating self analysis of each character is very revealing.  Keeps you enthralled until the end
B008BM9L72|5.0|I have heard so many bad stories re these books, ie badly written, all porn.<br />Well, I just loved these books, it made for entertaining reading, and yes the story was a bit weak but is that not what romance novels are all about? Maybe the first book was a bit spicy, but all in all, I was sorry when the booms were finished.
B0058YPG2K|5.0|Simply blown away by this season.  It starts off with a bang and then slows down a bit.  Half way through the season your heart is just about to explode with all the tension.  Amazing writing, and acting.  The greatest show of all time.
B004YXE438|5.0|I've tried many other puzzles, this one is the best.  In addition, the dev is very responsive and has additional puzzles about 2x yearly

B009JBWOU0|5.0|The Movie set came in in a timely fashion.  It was what we ordered and my son was very happy with his movies.  Happy with purchase.
B0014VPFTA|5.0|I just wanted to physically have this cd even though I had every song in my itunes.  Every song is amazing on this album and is really one of John's masterpiece.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Every episode, every minute.  Best show ever.  From the maids and butlers to the Lady and Lord, you care about them and can't wait until the next episode to find out how they are doing.<br /><br />Free John Bates!
0307352145|5.0|I rarely write reviews about books, but this book deserved some recognition. I have struggled my whole life with feeling as though i am weird or there is something wrong with me because of my introverted tendencies. I am not shy by nature but find myself easily overstimulated in large groups and feel drained after long social ventures. I have always known that I recharge being alone, but now i don't have to feel bad about it. I am by no means a recluse but I find myself wanting to be alone much more than my peers. I am even scrutinized for it. \\"You're such a looser, why don't you want to come out?\\" \\"Why would you rather stay home alone, you're so secretive.\\" If nothing else read this book to feel some sort of peace of mind for the way you feel, that it is not weird or secretive, it's just your preference and if people dont understand this that is on them.
B0083DJWGO|4.0|Like his other books it made for a good read but nothing stands out as a wow... that being said for those who haven't read a Taleb book well worth the read to break the mold of traditional risk analysis
B005LAJ1HW|5.0|This show is just pure amazing.  It might be a little slow for some people but I would put this right up there with breaking bad and mad men.  Blu ray, dvd, and digital combo is awesome for this price.
B003L77GG0|5.0|If you like Smallville, you will love Season 10, the final tie-in as the main character moves to being Superman. I wished the series continued.
B009GIPDQS|4.0|Book is good read for all<br />Grisham fans but don't expect courtroom drama as this one is different than previous ones by him
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I really didn't want to like this book. The concept of it is so awful but since it is so popular, I thought I would give it a try. The writing is so good that I couldn't put it down!
B009JBZH54|5.0|This box is so nice along with the booklet you get with it.  Quality is amazing.  You're better off buying the whole trilogy than getting just the third movie on blu ray.
B00005JKG9|5.0|Great Lines in this movie<br /><br />A-B-C<br />Coffee is for Closers<br />Etc.<br /><br />If you are in sales or know somebody who is in sales, this movie is a perfect fit.
B008IYSMLY|5.0|I like the series because of the story line and the good writing behind each episode. You won't be disappointed.
B008Y1YK9Y|5.0|First off, I'm an unapologetic MIB fan. That said, even the unenthused whom I've shared this with have gotten a lot of enjoyment from watching this third in the series. I caught one particular grump wiping a tear, as I did the first time I watched. My only regret is not ordering it thru Amazon, which would have saved me 6 dollars. But as it's such fun who cares? Well worth it.
B001OQCV6K|5.0|Good movie if you're a downey fan.  Some people don't like the movie but it's good for the casual viewer.
B008Y2FRFO|1.0|you can never get coins I left it for 5 days and I only got 40 coins so don't get it it is junk.You will regret getting it if you don't follow my lead.plus you can never get them to go over they always fall of side. you can never get the prizes.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Wow. Such wonderful storytelling from Colleen Hoover. So different from Slammed and Point of Retreat but job well done! Couldn't put this one down. Compelling, funny, disturbing, romantic as hell. Yes, you pretty much see the connection between these characters early on and can deduce other parts of the plot line but it really is done well. Heart-wrenching subject matter.
B0094WK9GU|5.0|Love evertyhing about this album.  There are some older songs on there but how it's maked to together brillant like always.
B0019IB26I|5.0|Every performance is amazing on this cd.  If you're not a big fan of blues, then the trio part may not interest you, but the solo and band performance are awesome.
B002M7A79S|4.0|Loved the characters. Picks up where TV series ends. Explains River's character, glad to see the Companion back. More Firefly stories, please.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|Most don't have a clue what these men go through to protect our freedoms.  This book was written very well and is a &#34;can't put down&#34; read.  I admire men like adam and the author.  Adam wasn't ashamed of his faith and the author wasn't ashamed to write about it. Highly recommended.
B0094OLJD0|5.0|This album is truly an odd but mesmerizing piece of work. The haunting voices of David Byrne and St.Vincent really works well on most of these songs, but what I really think makes this album work so well is the outstanding Brass section. It almost truly has a life of it's own. Soft and present on some songs and roaring and powerful on others, especially on the closing track, and while I don't consider myself to be a huge David Byrne fan(I liked him the best in The Talking Heads),and I've never even heard of St. Vincent until this record, if this is their first effort, I certainly hope it isn't their last.<br /><br />This is a truly great and clever album.<br /><br />My favorites: Who<br />  Dinner For Two<br />  The Forest Awakens<br />  Lazarus, and Lightning
B0027HOBM2|5.0|This is such a well done show.  It really makes me appreciate good television and the time period it's set in.  Mr.Weiner you are the man
B009E3EY38|5.0|Its Led Zeppelin in one of their finest moments ever.  Their reunion tour.  The song list, quality of the filming and sounds are fabulous.  A must have for anyone who likes rock and roll.

B001ANSSDC|4.0|this was a cute story:An unusual style: It leaves one in the dark for most of the book; nice ending
B00ARAO720|1.0|I see good reviews for this movie and opnions do vary depending on peronal taste but I wsa so bored with this movie, kept waiting for it to end!
B001706I5I|5.0|For a movie about the christian holiday, The Grinch does a fine job of not directly insinuating Christ while still sharing that delightful, caring, giving spirit that abounds this time of year. It hits closer to what I would deem the true nature of Christmas than many other films and even takes a heavy stab at commercialism. It is a good film, and Jim Carrey makes a humorous grouch of a grinch.
B00004T9UF|5.0|If theres any album that will with stand the test of time, it's this one.  I still listen to the tracks and get chills.  Good music never gets old
B004LWZWGK|5.0|Love this movie I bought it as a gift for my fiancé for Christmas.. It came on time and he now watches it on his iPhone!!!
0307272702|3.0|Book arrived in good condition. Contents very redundant but thought provoking. Basically tells the reader to stay away from junk carbs. Needs more instructional information. Very little info on how to carry out the optimal eating plan.<br />Speedy delivery.
B0084BMUFA|5.0|A wonderful tale to remind us of the true meaning of Christmas as well as a classic. Read it even if you have seen the movies that came from it.
B0017JKEL8|5.0|Great series to watch.  It is on the slower side of things but it you stick with the show, you'l love it.  Jon Hamm is an amazing lead actor, its a shame he'l probably never win an emmy for this role.
B009FZFONO|3.0|Amazon needs to have the application Cache a few minute of the video to the hard drive so those of us with slower internet connection can view in HD. Because there is no Caching we had to watch in SD, even though we paid for HD. With DirecTV they cache the video to the DVRs Hard Drive so HD remains

B005LAIH54|3.0|- Agenor, slacker son of Poseidon: \\"I'm Agenor.\\"<br />- Helius (shaking hands): \\"Helius. I've read that you were a great disappointment.\\"<br />- Agenor: \\"That's right. I AM great.\\"<br /><br />The time of the gods has passed, these superior creatures having been weakened severely by man's defiance, by man's aversion to worship. In this age, man has begun to look to his fellow man for inspiration. Ten years after Perseus slew the Kraken and forever etched his name in legend, he's getting called out again. All he wants to do is live in peace and obscurity and raise his young son Helius. What's a simply fisherman to do when the walls of Tartarus are crumbling? The impending collapse threatens to loose the fearsome Titan, Kronos, he who sired the three major gods of the Greek pantheon: Zeus, Hades, and Poseidon. When Zeus is betrayed and captured in the Underworld, his reluctant son, Perseus, once more assumes his demi-god's burden and sets off on a desperate rescue mission. Thanks to spectacular CG work, we're along for the ride. Thanks to pedestrian storytelling, it's a bumpy ride.<br /><br />Greek mythology is riddled with families so dysfunctional even Dexter and Debra Morgan are shaking their heads. The Greek deities are a particularly messed up bunch. Kin overthrowing kin, and kin slaying kin. If you know your Greek mythology, then you're aware that Zeus and his ambitious brethren dethroned their progenitors, the Titans, and caged them in Tartarus. And here's Perseus now, off to save his shackled father and slay his gramps. But he's not on a solo quest. As in CLASH OF THE TITANS, he's accompanied by a tiny entourage. This time, his primary companions are Queen Andromeda and fellow demi-god, Agenor, caddish son of Poseidon. As Agenor, Toby Kebbell adds a shady element and very welcome levity to a somber and onerously grand enterprise. Note that Rosamund Pike takes over from Alexa Davalos as Andromeda. She's a bit stiff.<br /><br />WRATH OF THE TITANS is weighed down by a serious case of blockbuster sequelitis. The first film, CLASH OF THE TITANS, offered a (slightly) more compelling narrative and plot conflict. That one had a truly cheesed off Perseus wrestling with his half-divinity even as he seethed against the gods, whom he (rightfully) held responsible for the deaths of his adopted family. In WRATH OF THE TITANS, Perseus has had ten years to come to grips with his acrimonious feelings against the gods, and he's toned down the emo stuff. Nowadays his dealings with his father Zeus tend to be more civilized. Still, it's a nod to continuity that, when ask, he refuses to come to his father's aid. Ten years later, and Perseus is still denying his fraction of godhood, still would rather remain a common laborer. It would take Perseus's witnessing a pocket preview of apocalypse in his tiny village before he leaps into action.<br /><br />The two prestigious name actors - Neeson as \\"Zeus,\\" Fiennes as \\"Hades\\" - are slumming, but they still lend an elevating presence. You may say that this movie sort of redeems Hades. I say it marginalizes him. The hero requires a stoic and steely demeanor and a leveling glare and the occasional blank stare, and that's very much in Sam Worthington's wheelhouse. Rosamund Pike looks determined (but stiff). Toby Kebbell is good for laughs. The always watchable Bill Nighy cameos as \\"Hephaestus.\\"<br /><br />Like its predecessor, this sequel is a technically superior product, so superior, in fact, that the film becomes a relentless parade of CG-crafted action pieces, and never mind the human element which is the grounding element. WRATH OF THE TITANS, above all, is meant to be mindless entertainment, a summer blockbuster, and there's a place for that, and I like going to that place often enough. The skirmishes against the Chimera and the family of Cyclops and against those incredibly lethal twin-torsoed foot soldiers are really well done. The stilted acting comes part and parcel, as well as the formulaic video-game style plot progression and the silly plot holes (murderous but then tame giant scorpions, anyone?). It's all done by the numbers, and not once did I feel the film earned its sense of jeopardy. Kronos, when he finally ascended, would've been well served if he'd been allowed even more screen time to lay waste to the landscape just to pound in how much of a threat he was on an epic scale. But, like the Kraken before him, Kronos flails around some - and does rack up an impressive body count, credit him - but then gets his butt handed to him rather too quickly, in my opinion. Essentially, the film serenades you with thunder and bluster, but someone lost sight of the personal touch. Ultimately, all WRATH OF THE TITANS did was meet my lowered expectations. On the up side, there's another sighting of the metallic owl from the original CLASH OF THE TITANS.deo-game style plot progression and the silly plot holes (murderous but then tame giant scorpions, anyone?).

B00936A0RU|5.0|This was an absolutely great movie that truely enjoyed. Not big on movies but really liked this one. I thought the acting was spectacular and I truely enjoyed the soundt track! In fact I bought the sound track too. However, I do not believe this movie is for children or folks who have a problem with realistic violence.

B009MO57H6|3.0|I'm not as dismissive of the Resident Evil film franchise as them angry diehard gamers who'd slammed it for being empty iterations and for skirting the game's canon storylines and continuity. I'm a fan of Milla Jovovich and of her Project Alice, a character created solely for the cinematic adaptation of Capcom's survival horror video game. I had fun watching the first four films, especially the first two. So, there, that was the carrot. Here comes the stick: RESIDENT EVIL: RETRIBUTION, latest and fifth in the film franchise, is a mess.<br /><br />It picks up right where RESIDENT EVIL: AFTERLIFE left off, with a brainwashed Jill Valentine (Sienna Guillory) and her Umbrella strike force about to storm the Arcadia tanker on which Alice and her friends await with lumps in their throats. RETRIBUTION's opening moments detail Valentine's successful assault and we soon see a captured Project Alice transported to a sprawling underground facility in frozen northern Russia, Umbrella Corporation's prime testing ground for its biohazard experiments. Alice learns that the homicidal artificial intelligence dubbed the Red Queen is back in control and means to advance its anti-humanity agenda. Elsewhere, a small rescue team deploys, composed partly of ex-Umbrella operative Ada Wong (Bingbing Li), Leon S. Kennedy (Johann Urb), and returning partner in zombie-slaying Luther West (Boris Kodjoe). But this is Project Alice, the post-apocalyptic badasss. Does she really require rescuing? (Yes, she does.)<br /><br />RESIDENT EVIL: RETRIBUTION unfolds like a video game, something that eventually took me out of the story, what there is of it. Most of the film consists of Alice and others navigating the Umbrella underground complex and fighting off various biohazards. That the complex extends for blocks and constitutes isolated set pieces designed to simulate Raccoon City, Tokyo, New York, and Moscow bolsters the video game impression. It feels like Alice, each time she moves on to the next city backdrop, is advancing to the next level. It's a conceit that's old hat by now. It lends to that cynical, soulless feel. And, of course, whenever you hear a supporting character say things like \\"Another minute, we're gonna be okay\\" or \\"Are you kidding? I'm going with you,\\" well, you automatically write them off.<br /><br />There is some admirable stuff. The introduction of the deaf girl Becky allows for a humanizing element for Alice who, like Ripley in ALIENS, takes on a mothering role. It's interesting that the zombies have evolved to the point where they now can ride motorcycles and fire weapons. There are some pretty cool brutal kills. I can never get enough of Jovovich in her tight leathers and platform shoes and applying her wire-fu and wasting hordes of CG monsters. I also liked that former cast members return (Guillory, Kodjoe, Michelle Rodriguez, Oded Fehr), although the doubling up of several characters leaves me ambivalent. Do we really need good and evil versions of Rain Ocampo and Carlos Olivera? And what ever happened to Claire and Chris Redfield?<br /><br />Paul W. S. Anderson - who in real life is married to Milla Jovovich - wrote, produced, and directed RETRIBUTION. It takes a certain talent and doggedness to produce hollow moneymakers like RESIDENT EVIL: RETRIBUTION. Never mind that he's bypassed Capcom's original take; you can get away with lack of faithfulness to the source material. But you lose street creds when what you come up with is hamfisted and numbing and trite. Give him a nod for trying to piece together various dangling plot threads from a decade's worth of films. But the execution collapses under such weight. And to echo them diehard gamers, Anderson's inclusion of ingame characters feels more like a slight because he doesn't respect their canonical backstories and, by extension, the game mythology. Me, I'm not much of a gamer so I was able to overlook Anderson's diverging from game mythology. As mentioned, I enjoyed the first four films. But RETRIBUTION feels a lot like treading water and feels mechanical. I hear Anderson's already working on the sixth film. Listen, today, anyone can produce serviceable CG effects. Nowadays, you have to fall back on archaic filmmaking methods to stand out. A method like, oh I dunno, competent storytelling. A disheartened, middle of the pack 2.5 out of 5 stars for RESIDENT EVIL: RETRIBUTION. I'm crossing my fingers for the sixth installment.r films.

B0095ZMMCK|4.0|As always with Tom Clancy, you are seeing a movie rather then reading a book.<br />I am already waiting to see the movie of this book.

B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Cool I love it so much more than eney other book in the world !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! And I got the awesomest kindle fire ever
B007SGM084|5.0|These books are so addictive, you seriously can't put them down because you just want to see what happens next. The stories are very fast paced and you are never bored, which I like because I get bored easily with books. I read through these books in no time.
B0038P59A0|5.0|I think Sherlock Holmes was a  great movie. all the actors did a wonderful job. I would give it a thumbs up , must watch movie.

B007PFD90G|5.0|This is a fantastic read! Rushdie's nuanced account of his experience with the fatwa issued against him is fascinating. He brilliantly ties in his personal life with the deep imperative to stand up for the freedom of speech . Thank you Mr. Rushdie for standing strong against the insanity of those instituting and promoting the craziness of the fatwa against you and upholding for us all the right to express ourselves.
B005LAIHE0|5.0|I bought this for my brother for Christmas and he said he loves it. It arrived very quickly even during the holiday rush. Great purchase!
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Held me magnetized to my kindle during the Xmas vacation.  A very well structured book and designed to trap you until the end.
B009WO7NQO|3.0|I was playing it and I paused it. The s xxx teen vanished. Besides being stuck on it and never being able to play it again, it was fun.
0452273331|5.0|I have all her books and they all have changed my life and look at this world we are destroying. So many good quotes to beat the ignorant and liberal with

B005HSG3VK|3.0|This a nice little Case and if I'd given this review when I bought it Approx: 6 months ago I'd have loved it. But it's not very durable and the stand feature has just about had it. I wouldn't recommend this product
B005LAII12|4.0|I bought this for my husband for Christmas because he LOVES Family Guy. It was very funny but I didn't like all the drug use that went on in it and there were parts that were a little graphic. It did have a good story-line though about growing up.<br />My husband thought it was hilarious!
B00A757EFW|5.0|just like the arcade game.. loved it..  lots of fun and it's free,, what more could you want.  Great game
B001U3Y5XE|4.0|EWhen my kids, wives, and all get together we play games. This was challenging and fun, much like a board game.
B00571F26Y|5.0|It is really hard to accept this new thought because we are so used to eating wheat but it makes perfect sense and if it improves many different health issues, it is worth trying!!
0316226424|5.0|I love the Twilight books and I am so sad it is over. This was a wonderful book and I am going to reread it many times. Nice ending to the series.

B0054JZC6E|5.0|great set of games I like the challenge of most of the games. Great for the kindle fire HD. works well on my cell too.
6305428387|5.0|Cool Runnings is another comedy movie in my collection based on a true story and its so enjoyable to watch no matter how many times you have watched it over the years.  I have yet to get tired of watching it and still makes me cry at the end of the movie when they don't give up and carry the bobsled to the finish line and everyone claps for them as they don't give up and finish what they started.  If you have yet to watch it buy this movie and see it at least once in your lifetime because I have a feeling you will enjoy it as much as rest of the people who already own it.
B006AZZPCM|1.0|Freezes constantly. I've been able to watch 2 videos since downloading 3 days ago. I was really happy at first because it's the only YouTube app I could find for kindle hd, but now I wish I had just gotten a regular kindle fire.
B004I744AS|5.0|I love this app. I bought it just to look up a word but I found it has articles quotes and accurate horoscopes. I love this app!
B003ODIZL6|5.0|Too easy. Need  Cantonese  so much fun. Wowiezowie and made dereliction so mundane and spiffy with quantum physics by golly right in there p
B00007AJGH|5.0|Who Framed Roger Rabbit is by far one of my favorite animated movies I have in my collection of comedy movies.  I gave it a 5 star rating because you can't but to laugh at the toon parts and the stupid stuff they do to make people laugh out loud.  I hadn't watched this movie is so much time past that I had actually forgotten certain parts of the movie so I enjoyed it a lot because of the memories from when I watched it before many years ago.  My viewpoint is this is a classic movie for anyone's collection of movies that they should own.  If you have yet to buy this movie you are missing out on a very funny and classic animated movie that is within the 100 best movies list of this century and I have to agree totally with that statment and list. So it will be worth the money to own this edition of the movie and keep in your collection forever.
B006LSZECO|2.0|Just way too weird for me. The first half was great, but it veered off into crazy land for the 2nd half and I didn't enjoy it.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Simply an amazing book. I highly recommend it to anyone and everyone who enjoys a good read. I Love it!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Best book I have ever read can't wait till I see that movie like every one else! I love peeta
B001CTDH76|5.0|Overall I have loved all of the episodes of the mentalist! The cast was picked very well! If you like murder mystery this is a great series. It's also cool to have an investigator be able to mess with people's minds! The plans he has to show who the killer is are really cool and creative!
B0052RDHTM|2.0|It has a nice pace at the beginning, with lots of stories you can speculate as to their future interactions. But the last 1/3 of the book just dragged on endlessly.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The book was as good as the movie. Kept me very interested as I read on. Very excited to read the next book in the series!
B009B8YZKS|5.0|It was an awesome movie!!! Any halo fan would absolutely love this movie. Very entertaining and a lot of action along with a great story that's not told in the game. It's just great :)
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Fell in love with Downton with the 1st episode, and have continued to eagerly await each episode !  Wow - season 3 starts tonight !
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was amazing I think you should definitely read this if you like adventures and books like this one and the next two
B005P3NPXG|4.0|You'll probably like this album as well. I found this CD a bit lacking, when compared to SOUL, but Soul 2 is still a VERY good CD. It definitely has a more funk feel to it. Worth it.<br />Give it a listen
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|I can't stop playing it!!! So much fun and I've been playing it everyday for like a half hour to an hour a day and it doesn't get old!!! So many tracks and so many towers and the towers have two different upgrade paths for different gameplay experiences.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Could not wait to see how each character would align with each opponent and who would survive.  Great story telling.  Suzanne Collins is a master; can't wait for more.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Very good I liked it. When prim died I was very sad I never thought coin was a horrible person.
B000FBJAOG|4.0|Lots of helpful information to allow me to prepare for the Zombie apocalypsis and the next person who breaks into my house.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This is a lovely app. Yea the kindle fire hd does already tell you the amount of battery that is left but it doesn't tell you how long it takes to charge it fully or how much time is left. Over all a great app with no complaints
B007SGM084|5.0|I'd recommend this trilogy to mature audiences.  These books are not for the faint of heart and they will defiantely get your sex drive in OVERDRIVE - so be ready.  The books we well written, explicit, fun, and me and my husband had the most and best sex for the month it took me to read these 3 books.  I could not put the books down, nor did I want too - just sorry they had to end.  EL James has a way of writing that make you want more; more of everything.  I truly enjoyed reading his books and can't wait to read what comes next.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|What a rollercoaster of a third book. I often found myself reading faster than my eyes could. Admittedly, the spark of the beginning of the book seemed to linger before it did ignite, once it caught, there was no stopping my need to read more. Well done.
B0050QV0RQ|4.0|Symphony of Eternity is a well executed straight forward turned-based RPG.  Its strengths are its minimal learning curve, opportunity for extensive customization of equipment and skills, and its tightly controlled completely linear progression which protects the player from missables and getting lost.  Its weaknesses are its lack of character development and lack luster story.  In fact, this game is really a well designed but disguised dungeon crawler.  My comments here are based on the game as played with a stylus on the Kindle Fire HD.<br /><br />The good technical points include: minimal backtracking out of dungeons (almost always there is an automatic teleport); all findable items are in visible treasure chests, so there is no need to click on everything in sight; there is a world map that usually has a 'next' location marked on it; there are a few locations designed for easy level grinding, if that is your preference; all monsters are visible and can often be avoided to minimize random battles; you can save anywhere except in battles; there are multiple save slots; customization of skills can be changed anytime on the fly, so if you build up a character's physical attack and later decide you would rather increase his physical defense, or even modify his job/class, you can easily make the change.<br /><br />The bad technical points include: minimal documentation, so you have to guess or browse the forums to figure out what various skills mean; repeated crashes; long lists of items that are not usefully arranged, so lots of scrolling is necessary; the scroll bars are narrow and you might find yourself repeatedly 'clicking' on a list item rather than scrolling (although you are given the opportunity to cancel).<br /><br />Depending on your tactics, some of the boss battles can be long, although with the proper resources and strategy they can be considerably shortened.  My own strategy was to mass resources and then just whittle down the boss.<br /><br />The graphics are adequate, but no more that that, and the sound is repetitive.<br /><br />The interface is touch screen based, and I prefer it to the virtual controller interface of Eve of the Genesis, a similar jrpg.  The touch screen allows you to touch where you want to go, and in the dungeons to draw your path and move quickly and sneak past monsters.  The virtual controller in Eve of the Genesis forces you into lots of small back and forth movements to circumvent obstacles.<br /><br />If you like controlled, easy to learn and play turn-based role playing games, then you should enjoy Symphony of Eternity.
B008JGSM6G|3.0|I think this game is a really good game but watch out for if you buy something it might not  download it and it freezes a lot when you're like playing it but this is a good game.
B0070XFNDE|5.0|Truly exception book for people of all ages.  First time reading a Zafon book and I was pleasantly surprized with amount of attention he kept me focused on the characters.  It was like I was in the book as one of the characters.  I picked it up for light reading and the book was a quick read, because I did not want to put it down.  If you pick it up, you too will enjoy every moment, from beginning to end.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book had me bawling in the last quarter of it. It is an incredible read. I honestly don't know how he could imagine up such an incredible love story of some cancer patients, but it was incredible. This is a must read book. You won't want to put it down.
B001CVCB44|5.0|This is one of my favorite records of all time, and one of the few that I own for vinyl.  It is the type of record that I can actually sit down, and actually dedicate my time purely to listening to.  From front to end, it is very well rounded and beautiful.<br /><br />The slipcase is quite nice.  A butterfly fold with a painting of horses inside.  Each side is side loading, with an extra yellow sleeve on the inside with song listing.  Nice package, feels heavy, on a strong stock.  Very nice addition to a collection and very nice for display (the band name and album title are not on the front artwork)<br /><br />The songs are spread out over four sides, so only two or three songs per side but if you're sitting on your magic carpet and listening to this intensely then it doesn't matter that you'll be changing sides manually.  It's all part of the experience.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This was a wonderful  book! So much love in it and you feel everything they are feeling it's awesome! I rate 5 stars absolutely.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Interesting Read, easy to follow, hard to put down. will keep you on the edge of your seat and wanting more.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|This was a &#34;couldn't put down&#34; read.  It's about time Clancy produced another one of these non-stop pageturner type novels.
B000003R7G|5.0|This album is one of my top 10 of all time, so I allow myself to &#34;double dip&#34; and this is one of the few vinyl's that I actually own to listen to on a record player.  It's one of the few records I can listen to completely from front to end, every song, without feeling cheated.  Very well rounded, conceptually genius... P'head are incredibly talented (though I realize they are not for everyone)<br /><br />The sound quality on this is amazing, and truly does give you a different listening experience from listening on compact disc.  Songs are spread out over four sides for optimum quality.  The sleeves are kind of cheap (standard paper with a hole) and sometimes tricky to get back into the album sleeve which is no thrills side loading back and front cardboard sleeve.  But, that's shouldn't be a deterrent.  This album is amazing!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Strange ending to a great series.  Routing for the underdog the whole way.  Glad it ended the way it did - but wanted more -  Strange ending.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|This is a very fun game.  I played other AB games and this one is my favorite of all.<br />Note this review is for my Kindle Fire HD edition
B00004YRBC|5.0|One song per side.  Four sides.  Mind Blown.<br /><br />Lyric-less post-rock for your senses.  There's lots of voice &#34;sampling&#34; on a couple of the tracks that really intrigue and heighten the listening senses.  The structure of GYBEs music makes for an epic meditative journey, I can't really describe it.  Drugs, I never touch the stuff, but I imagine hordes of stoners or worse will say it's the most magnificent music to be drugged out and listen to.  I mean... without drugs it's enough of an amazing experience for me.  Try listening without drugs.  It's amazing work, dare I say transcendental.
B000OVLINI|5.0|So sorry the series is over.  I could not get enough of this!  He has a way telling a story to make you feel like you are living the story as you are reading it.  This one is probably for a little older crowd; but oh so worth the read.  Pick it up and fall in love with this author!
B009NOVCTM|5.0|Although i have an extensive Rolling Stones collection. I just wanted this 3 cd set . It has all the songs we know and some more recent releases. Plus two new songs. I would have liked to see some more of their earlier hits. The sound quality is good and it is a great 50th anniversary release, my wife gave me this for Christmas.
B002PHVHFI|5.0|The artwork for this record almost makes it worth the purchase.  Then you listen to the music... wow!  One of the most amazing records ever assembled.  Supposedly inspired from reading The Diary of Anne Frank, and knowing that you can definitely hear what some of the songs are directly referencing.  Beautiful guitar and whiny singing makes for a very emotional record, definitely worth listening to.  It will surely conjure up a lot of emotion and thought in all of us.<br /><br />The packaging is nice.  I like the labels on the record itself.  Though it is &#34;only&#34; two-sided the quality of the recording is still fantastic.  It comes with a single sheet with all of the songs listed along with a rudimentarally prepared lyric sheet which is hard to read and doesn't include all the words (and some words that don't belong) but still artistic in it's own way.<br /><br />A great listen from start to finish.
B00A0SJWQU|4.0|This was great movie. It was full of fast paced action. I think it was actually better than the original.
B007U1FEJE|4.0|When i called up a friend and asked what he thought of this album .He said it's a great beach boys album, sounds just like the earlier albums. i was presently surprised when i received my copy and i would say this is a must for every Beach Boys fan. i thinkthis album will be a great introduction to younger people who may have never heard the Beach Boys. Its good and you will enjoy he great tracks.
B0076DELIG|4.0|I found it hard to put down.<br /><br />It's Harry Bosch at his best -- dedicated to the case and in trouble for his persistence.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|awesome ending to the dark night trilogy, action throughout the movie kept you engaged, now ready for the next series starring Robin!
B005O59C0K|5.0|I have quite a few cd's on Frank, but this was well worth the money as i received 8 albus , some of which I wanted to purchase. if you buy all these 8 albums individually it will cost you a minimum of $60.00 or more. Sond quality is good, but unfortunately no booklet or info on the albums
B004GUSG4M|5.0|Memory is a fickle thing. As I get older, I find that I can remember the smallest, most trivial things from my past, but I can't remember where I've left my keys. Imagine if you woke up each morning, forgetting even those trivial things from the past, in fact, forgetting your past entirely. This is the premise of S.J. Watson's thriller, Before I Go To Sleep.<br /><br />Christine Lucas wakes up in a room she doesn't remember, with a man she does not know. She goes into the bathroom and sees a face twenty years older than it should be, in a mirror surrounded by pictures of herself and the man in the bed. That man patiently explains to her that he is her husband, that they've been married for twenty two years, and that she's had an accident and has lost her memory. And this happens every single morning of her life.  When a cell phone rings in her bag, and a man calling himself Dr. Nash tells her to look for her journal hidden away in her closet, the following few weeks become a game of To Tell The Truth. She oscillates between trusting and then questioning the intentions of the man she is living with, knowing he is intentionally lying to her.  Not knowing which way to turn, and having to re-read her hidden journal to unravel her life story every single day when she wakes up, she begins to catch glimpses of the life she wants back, no matter what the cost.<br /><br />The author keeps us in the dark the same way Christine is. We unravel her story by reading her journal entries, and as the story progresses, we don't know whom to trust either. As a story telling device, it's a very effective, and I was thankful I was reading on a Kindle so I couldn't read the ending first. The characters we think we know, we really don't, and just like Christine, as she wakes up every morning, we turn the page not knowing where the story came from nor where it's going. If you like a good thriller and psychological drama wrapped up in one, then this is it. I usually don't read this genre, but it was recommended to me, so I'm passing it along. Excellent book, a quick page turner that will keep you guessing pretty much to the end.
0064436063|5.0|This edition of Dickens' &#34;A Christmas Carol&#34; is a feast for the eyes as well as for the ear. Beautiful illustrations make this adaptation the perfect read aloud for the entire family. This is a treat for young and old alike.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I enjoy playing the game, but it is extremley annoying when you play with someone who just writes words instead of actually drawing. Other than that, awesome game.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|You will only ever read several books in a life time that will take you on a journey that touches your heart and soul in a profound way. This book was one of those for me.<br />Sky and Dean are the most amazing people and i absolutely fell in love with them. That first kiss i would sell my soul to feel and their bond was breathtaking. I hope there will be a part two to their story as they deserve it.<br />Colleen please write more about these characters as they deserve more of their story to be told.<br /><br />Thank you for the journey and keep writing amazing stories. I am a fan for life (:
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game. I telling you the truth. It's worth my money. But there is one problem with this game. There's one glitch in this game.
B009HEJXFS|4.0|I loved MIB 1.  MIB 2 was okay, not near as good as 1.  When I saw there was a 3 I thought oh my, I bet this will really be a waste of time.  What a surprise.  It was really good.  Had a great ending.  I thought Josh Brolin did a good job and sometimes his voice was so similar to Tommy Lee Jones I wasn't really sure who was talking.  I would have liked it better if Jones had been in it more but Will Smith did a great job on his own.  If you were a MIB 1 fan I think you'll enjoy this one also.
B00AA0TJO8|3.0|The game looks cute and I have played some, but not quite sure what to do to advance and there doesn't seem to be much help provided.  The hints don't help much.  Would love to play it more, but just don't know what to do.
B00AQ3K8IU|2.0|I really was enjoying this book, I really was. At first I was skeptical of reading it since the two main characters were teenagers but since it has a five star rating I decided to give it a try. I wasn't a big fan of the writing but despite that I LOVED the first half of this book. It was going along great, I figured the big plot point was going to be something (okay maybe some slight spoilers ahead) to do with Holder. Wow was I wrong. When it got to part where she goes over to his house and \\"that\\" scene happened I immediately rolled my eyes. If I wanted to read about that subject matter I definitely would have picked a more adult book to read. So after that chapter I knew the whole rest of the story and I ended up just skimming the rest of the book and I am so glad I did. The whole rest of the book was all teen angst and it wasn't handled well at all.<br />Then when she finally goes to talk to Karen I was hoping that I was wrong and Karen wasn't going to say what I thought she was going to say. Nope, the author completely jumped the shark in that aspect as well and I had that all figured out way before that chapter even happened.<br />This book was extremely predictable (after the chapter where she goes to his house) and was all just too much for me. I seriously felt like I was reading fan fiction or something. This is the type of stuff I used to write in high school. It was all angst after that, seemed completely rushed, and wasn't handled well at all. Why this has a five star rating is beyond me.
B00A6PD8RQ|5.0|Great movie!  I loved it.  Was a little intense for my kiddos at times, but they are little (5 and 3.5).  We all loved the humor and the story, just some of the bear scenes are really scary for them.  Personally, I thought it was hilarious and exciting and wonderful.  I love Billy Connolly, and he was fantastic in this movie.  The story is excellent, it's funny and heart-warming, and the picture and music are excellent.  Overall, right up my alley.
0307744434|5.0|I read the book for the second time over the past weeks, and it is still as magical as it was during the first read. The stories in the book weave together into a magical blanket: the fantasies around the magic, the love story, the dwellings of a boy looking for his future and all the normal people and their lives with the circus - an amazing feat. The use of the dates, the changing timeline: pay attention to it, makes the book all the more interesting.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Safe Haven was captivating and delightfully suspenseful! It was hard to even put the book down! Definitely a must read!
B0053O89WY|5.0|Thanks for sending this.  My wife and I will get a lot of use from this.  Product was fine.  Packaging was fine.  Box arrived on time.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|I should have re-read the prequel as the names and their previous connectivity was confusing. My own 'forgetfulness' perhaps but a brief review would have certainly helped. I got lost in trying to place names and it diminished the enjoyment of the story line. But....Follett is always a good read, and the history learned incidentally a bonus.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Is Katniss's indecision between P and G!!!! I found it almost a bit bothersome since Gale is really a character we dont know much about, versus Peeta who's such a kind, sweet guy anyone could just love! I even admit to liking Peeta far more than what i like her, I understand she's just a teenager but stil, for me she comes across a bit a shallow/empty, even too self centered whereas Peeta has such a clear view of what he wants, needs and love.... Her.<br /><br />I think this second book did have a bit of a slow start, but actually, after the hit-after-hit pace of the first one,<br />i found this to be a nice start to catch my breath back just in time for al the action in the final third of the book.<br /><br />There are still several questions left unanswered, like those mainly surrounding the newly discovered people<br />from District 13 so I think the author did a good job at keeping me interested.<br />We get to know some more about the main characters, like Haymicth for example and we come to see that his<br />manners and behaviors have a pretty good explanation, everything from his drinking to his decision to live alone,<br />and i think these where things that needed to be explained.<br /><br />The book took me only 3 days to read because so i certainly recommend it to other readers, if you loved book 1,<br />do not stop there and let's all find out how this venture will end!!!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This is by far the best book I've ever read. My favorite book, I'm sharing with every one. Love it!
B005LAIIKI|3.0|Silent letters are stupid and I don't really like Jamie Fox, but such nuisances are beside the point. It's the plot of Django Unchained, a historic epic of sorts in which Fox plays a negro slave turned contract killer, that's the problem. The first half or so actually presents an interesting plotline as we travel with Django, led by fellow bounty hunter King Schultz; Christoph Waltz as the movie's coolest character; to a \\"MISSISSIPPI\\" plantation to free his (Django's) estranged wife. The final stretch is where everything sort of falls apart. Quentin Tarantino may be one of the best movie-makers pop cinema has to offer, yes, but this one suffers from what seems to be a simple case of artistic overindulgence. That final stretch, which begins with a ridiculous shoot-out, comes across as an unnecessary tack-on to what, though nowhere near his Inglourious Basterds magnum opus, could've been an enjoyable movie.<br /><br />A dinner scene involving a head slave named Stephen and a secret being revealed unravels too conveniently; there isn't enough reason given for Stephen's sudden plot-turning suspicion; but there are moments of genuine tension there. You wonder, if only for a minute or two, whether or not the protagonists will make it out alive. That's it though. There is no real tension or suspense anywhere else in the movie, which also lacks in the way of humor. Brutal violence breaks itself for chuckle time, and sometimes that works; a scene involving a blind lynch mob on horseback nears hilarity; but the movie's many comedy attempts too often fall flat. Quentin Tarantino composed the words, but the general dialogue is missing his signature zing. There's not really any cleverness or grand irony here. Nothing wows, at-least not in a positive sense. It's just a slightly engaging slave story that goes on for too long.<br /><br />marcellee.com
B0064X7FVE|4.0|It is so nice to get the information quick and not have to wait on the news to be on TV.
B000002AGN|5.0|Jazz just makes me feel better. I appreciate the talent needed to improvise.Although I do not understand the complecomplexities of jazz I know what I like and I really like Take Five!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I LOVED this book!! I have never reviewed a book before but I felt so moved by this story!!  It is an emotional ride. I laughed ,I cried, I got mad......it was great!!!!  Just a fabulous read and I would definitely recommend it . Most definitely a top 5 book!!!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is fun, challenging, and addicting. It keeps the kids busy Working on eye/hand coordination. It is similar to temple run.
B0070ZLZ1G|4.0|All educators and parents should read this book.  It has such important information about brain research and innovative approaches to learning.  It's a quick, accessible read, but provides deep insights.<br /><br />My only complaint is that the structure seems haphazard at times and forced at other times.  Regardless, I highly recommend it.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This was another great read. I think I might say it's about as good as FSOG. Can't wait till the next one.
B00AA0TJO8|4.0|The game is fun, but it should not keep asking me to rate it, my 5 year old daughter rated it with gibberish so I had to fix that.. -1 star since it keeps asking me to rate it..
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I really loved the simplicity of romance in this book....I could read it over and over again..I enjoyed it a lot
B005S9EJ14|5.0|I bought this for my mother-in-law and she LOVES it.  She watches it over and over! A good bet for a gift... if you need one.
B008MEM24S|5.0|This is a fun game that makes you strategize a little. We also love Perry :) It is addicting even for adults.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|loving it(: i can play this all day but cant get past the snake level thingy kinda hard but yeah totally fun
B005LAII0I|5.0|I loved the movie, so I bought it for my daughter who is 50th.  She has watched it several times.  Guess I will have to borrow it from her to watch it again.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|THIS is a very fun game. My son has a blast playing it. I would recommend this game to anyone that likes mystery games.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|I found this book very fascinating. Being narrated by Jack, a 5 year old I believe is what made it so compelling. The bond between mother and son, some would deem unhealthy but given the circumstances it was just amazing how normal Ma kept Jack's first few years. A great read I definitely recommend.
B0086213XW|3.0|I'm pretty sure this movie is supposed to be about marriage, relationships, infidelity, and ennui, but it turns out to be about turquoise and orange.
B0098VXBIA|4.0|This movie seems to be predictable in the plot, but takes a fun turn with serious topics and comedy. It's still a chick flick, but like Bridesmaid, your significant other will enjoy watching it with you.
B008Y1YKE4|5.0|We loved this movie when we saw it at the theater, so we got it for Christmas.  Very cute movie for parents and kids!
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is a great book. It has a way of holding you on every page. It is a must read.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Spooky story, I think the little companion that you earn to assist you in the game is a fun addition. The seek/find games are simple. I enjoy more difficult searches, but figuring out how the accomplish the tasks makes up for it. I like that there is a hint button if needed. Overall the world of the Carnival is fun to explore. Relaxing, not a brain buster. I am enjoying the play. If you are looking for a casual game, this is a good game for you. It would be a good game for 12 &amp; up.
B000E1JOSE|4.0|Orbison's music is some of the best ever made in America.  So I got this CD as a gift for my wife, as she's always loved his songs.  I also love his voice, and my only distraction was the fact that the audience sounds at the beginning and end of each song detracts from the beauty of listening to his voice.  In addition, a couple of his songs on this CD are longer renditions of the popular versions, (in particular, Pretty Woman), and that was no where as pleasant, even though the long play of the guitar is rather stunning, it's not what I was looking for in this CD.  Still, it's a great collection as it pretty much includes all his very best songs.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|if you love magic  this is wonderful....a tale for someone who has a wonderful imagination , it needs to be experienced throught this book
B00846REIS|4.0|At first I was concerned that it would be too similar to the 50 shades of gray trilogy because I found too many similarities and I felt that she could have switched a few things around· However as I continued to read I honestly felt in love with the characters , the author did switch slot of things around enough to make it interesting and different!
B0018D4SHY|3.0|I can't say that all of the songs on this CD are quite as great.  But then, most were not my favorites even long ago.  But, there are enough of the ones I occasionally like to be nostalgic about, that I can enjoy about 60% of this CD.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This free application lets you take Angry Birds with you wherever you go. We purchased it for our Kindle Fire. It's free and it takes seconds to load it. Great for all ages!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|What a great read. I am on holidays and I have read Hopeless within my first day. Highly recommended.I have lost weight because i couldn't stop reading to eat.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|This game is fun and entertaining. I would recommend it to my friends.Have only played for alittle while but look forward to building my town bigger and better.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|FUNNY FUNNY SHOW........THE ACTORS ARE OUTSTANDING......THE WRITERS ARE INNOVATIVE AND  HYSTERICAL....WATCH IT..WATCH IT....!!  TBBT SHOULD WIN EVERY AWARD OFFERED TO TELEVISION PROGRAMS.
B00127RAJY|5.0|Amazing workout in half an hour (including warm up cool down and getting the dvd started).  If you stick to it you will see results within a week.  I did 24 days and loved the results.  One of my husbands friends commented on how strong I was when I helped unload boxes of ceramic tile.  You will notice the changes in yourself, each time you do the work out.  i could not do a regular push up at the beginning of my \\"training\\" and was so pleased to get the strength as I worked out.  be sure to push yourself, you might not know you can do it until you try.  I moved to the next level every 10 days, they do get harder!  I am trying to get my husband to use this!  Everyone can find 30 minutes and it is a great workout, you are done before you know it.
B006LSZECO|4.0|The concept of the book is really interesting. The ending of the book was a little disappointing but still an overall good book.
B0076DELIG|5.0|The Black Box - Harry Bosch just keeps getting better and better..I can't wait for the next one...maybe another one with Mickey Haller?
B006IMY5ZU|4.0|I watch baseball occasionally, but really only follow one team, so this story was entirely new for me. Yet I was drawn in to the plot very quickly. Fast and witty humor race through this root-for-the-underdog flick. Jonah Hill pays a convincing newbie baseball savant, while Brad Pitt perches as his crafty mentor: a washed out player turned general manager. Together, they give excellent performances as a duo scraping to piece together a winning roster. Highly recommend this movie!
0345803485|5.0|Loved these books, could never put them down. I was so mad I dint just buy all 3 when I got this one cus when I was done this one I had to wait to get the next 2 and I could not wait to know what happend next
B007UXSPK2|5.0|If you are looking for action; you have found it. Tom Cruise might be strange in life, but on the big screen, he is larger than life. This movie has non-stop action. You can't take your eyes off the screen. I am not a critic. I just wanted to watch an action movie. This movie delivers.
B007THA4FI|4.0|The only reason this book isn't getting a full 5 stars from me is because it took me so long to really get into it. The first three quarters of it drags on and I truly only forced myself along because it was J.K., and I felt obligated to finish it. The care for the characters and their day to day life crept up on me. And I actually had to set my kindle down towards the end and take a breather because I was so overwhelmed with emotion concerning the well-being of a character I didn't know I had developed concern for until that very moment.
B005LAIHSG|5.0|I loved this movie, Iv wached it 4 times so far and I always cry at Kristen's speach close to the end. This is a great movie and a wounderful retelling of a childhood fav.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I can't wait to come home and use all my coins :) Great game. I would definitely recommend this to a friend.
