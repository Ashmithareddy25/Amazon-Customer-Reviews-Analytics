B005VPRDAY|3.0|This set includes just enough Legos to make the house on the label of the box.  After making the house,, what did my granddaughter do?  Complained there should be more Legos, and asked me to buy her more, which I'll do, but should not have to..
0152465073|5.0|I wish I'd heard about this book sooner in my life. You could base an approach to life on the lessons in this book and have a very fulfilling life. I'm actually rather humbled by the impact this book has had on me. I can't recommend it highly enough.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|I really like that you can make your own stick man. I don't do facebook,  so I wish there was another way to get hints. All in all so far a fun game.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|II BOUGHT THIS FOR MT  DAUGHTER TO SHARE WITH HER FRIENDS.<br />IT WAS MY SECOND PURCHASE OF THI DVD.<br />I RECOMMENDED IT TO OUR POSTMASTER AND WILL RECOMMEND IT TO OTHERS TOO.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This book was great! I couldn't put it down! :) although it is kind of like a lot of other books couldn't help but read and smile and hope it would work for them.
B0093X805W|4.0|I loved it!! I got the book two days ago and am already finished. IT was so good, I couldn't stop reading the book.
B0083P1QUM|4.0|This was a little slow starting out for me but once I got going I was hooked just like always.  Turned into a very solid Scarpetta read for me. I do miss some of the back and forth that was in  her earlier novels but over all it was good to catch up with the characters.
B00846F1YW|2.0|Very fun game, wish I could complete it. The game glitches at chapter 13 and sends me back to my home page. I would rate this game a lot higher if game didn't do this.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|nice to have around when weather is getting bad.been real handy in helping to decide if we should go out or not
B009H442DG|5.0|My daughter loved it. It thrilled her to hear these wonderful duets.  It made her remember her all time favorite movie, Greece.
B009MF56GC|3.0|Pretty good tongue in cheek action movie if you like that kind of thing.  Jet Li's appearance pretty much a cameo, might be the funniest part of the movie.
B0061QD88S|5.0|for my granddaughter - she loves this movie (as did i as a child) and it was on her wish list; i love that i could get it at a super price, especially when the stores were overcharghing for them.
B008KOTNVA|5.0|Starting off with the cons, the case is a little cheap. Now on to the pros, this tool has everything you need for small electronic repair.  It is extremely high quality.  All my life I have been stunted by not having the right tool for the job, and now I can do anything, Lol.  The bits aren't  standard 1/4 in bits allowing you to fit into small spaces.  The flexible shaft is another plus allowing you to get just about anywhere, and the center of the shaft stays still for you to hold just turning the ends, very convenient. I would recommend this product to any technician or do-it-youselfer!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is the most amazing tool. You can read the same scriptures in almost any translation you can think of to help you better understand what you are reading. It is the only Bible I carry to church.
0439023521|5.0|This is a good book.  Quite simply written but the ideas put forth by the author offer a lot to think about.  Read all three books in 3 days.
B00AHSMDQY|3.0|I found the movie dull and Laborious. There was a lot of potential in this storyline but the movie didn't utilize what could have been at least a good action flick
B009GEBBNQ|2.0|Actually, most pornos have better plots and acting. Also: flying aircraft carrier. Yes, that's right, a flying aircraft carrier. What's its main weaponry? Apparently, foreshadowing.
B00APUQH0W|2.0|I love Clint Eastwood. But this movie was tiring and predictable at every curve. In Gran Torino the mean old nasty man routine worked but not here.
B006ON41FC|1.0|The orientation of the game is upside down no matter which way I turn it.  I can't figure out how to change it. Please fix!
B00AA7O22U|3.0|Great if you like to see blow up. The movie goes too far trying to give each &#34;hero&#34; his moment in the sun. Nothing you haven't seen time and time again. A little hard to stay interested at times.
B00AE2J5HI|4.0|Very violent and graphic. Probably closer to being accurate depicting those troubled times in history. The actors are fabulous and perfict for their parts. A great film but not for children!!
B009S8PEHY|5.0|I grew up with Rod and he has a voice so distinctive that I consider him a &#34;special taste&#34;. He is not for everyone but if you love his voice, you will love this album for Christmas. Lucky for me, my wife loves Rod like I do!!
B009SJ3H8Q|5.0|love this show and have definitely recommended to other people i know.  i can't wait for it to start again
B00A0SLTCU|4.0|The quality of this movie is awesome but the original is a camp classic. The ladies in this are captivating and Colin does a great job.
B002N14GPE|4.0|it was a pretty good movie. i didn't expect what happened at the end of the movie that was a twist
B009HEJXFS|4.0|I doubt there will be a 4th movie. This was about a 7 on a 10 scale. Special effects are good, humor is not as present as previous movies. The ending, I thought, is the best part.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|It arrived as promised in new condition! What more could one ask for? I love The Avengers! The CGI Hulk is the BEST Hulk of any film to date - more realistic looking. Others gave professional reviews on this movie so Im not going in depth on it. BUY IT! You'll be glad you did.
B005UA0FLE|5.0|That is Michael Buble! If you want to hear the words and &#34;feel their meaning&#34;, you listen to the classic, yet stylized, voice of a master craftsman. The Lord has blessed Mr. Buble with a distinctive voice to make you feel like you are hearing your favorite songs for the first time.
B000M5AJQI|4.0|it's a very nice movie, Di Caprio is a very good actor and it's one of it's best movies. Blu-ray quality it's perfect.
B001QERPDO|4.0|The CD is great. I bought it as a gift and it was a big hit. Great price too. Thank you!
B001NHNG64|5.0|Well I am hooked...this was better than the first book. I like all the info and research that go into these books. Great story...very timely...<br />.reacher gets the girl and the bad guys...not a bad shot either...can't wait to read the next one.
0525952926|5.0|I have enjoyed this book very much and am looking forward to the three one in the trilogy.  I have read most of Mr Follett books and have found that the most recently written books are great and can hardly put them down!
B0064W639K|5.0|This is hands down one of the best noir-inspired Batman stories! The writing by Loeb is superb; there are twists and turns that you won't expect in Loeb's writing. Sale's art lends itself perfectly to this noir tale, the play with light and shadow create a perfect atmosphere for the Dark Knight's Long Halloween.<br /><br />I highly recommend this graphic novel to anyone who has just begun reading Batman or who has watched Nolan 's Batman trilogy.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|First played it on the Wii at a friend's place, had to get it for myself. Excellent puzzle type game, super fun! One of the best.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This is a good book and it makes you think from the beginning.  You where he is going; what he leading up to.  You try to follow all of the leads.  Will he get all of these people  to follow him.  It is very good reading and Idon't want to give away the plot but it's a good one.
B008N1LL42|5.0|Awesome movie, I have watched it numerous times and still get chills everytime they recommission the USS Missouri to kick some butt!!!!
B007BFSYMS|4.0|Use this app every evening and really notice the improved sleep I get now.  Some of the sounds are better suited to wakeful activities.  Airplane works great for drowning out food court noises so you can study.  Best feature are the occasional new sounds you can download.  A couple of the basic sounds have obvious loops but most are very usable. Would give five stars if the loops on a few were less obvious.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|Great game! Having a blast. Would highly recommend. Puzzles are challenging but still enjoyable. Great job on another great game!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love pinterest because u can pin so many awesome pictures and stuff! I recommend you get it...it also works on the computer too plus it's free! love it!!!!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Perfect end to a great series. Couldn't wait to read the next sentence throughout the entire series.Almost sad it's over.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|The character of this book sees every thing from a different perspective, a new angle. It makes you think about your life and how you look at the details
B009UNGYHG|5.0|I chose because of price love it very useful very compact it works very well I would recommend this product!!!
B005LAJ23A|5.0|This season on blu-ray doesn't need a review...you know it's awesome.  Great deal and fast shipping really made the purchase worth it, check it out if you haven't started watching yet!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|My mom loves it when she is playing my kindle she usually does not get off it because he loves playing pride claw and it is super addicting!!!
B0070UFMOW|5.0|I'm quite impressed with the sound quality that this unit pushes out. It's definitely a great price point comparative to other DAC/ Amps. And if paired up with the E9K desktop amp; this DAC becomes a fairly decent upgrade for any embedded sound processing units from laptops and other devices. The only problem I have with this is the manual, I definitely think that saying it was written in broken English is a compliment.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|In the AppStore it was a roll off the dice on a free calculator...Luck was a lady when I chose this one.  For basic calculations you will not be disappointed.
1451638450|5.0|Still my absolute favorite SF author.  Like David Weber, a master of the genre who never runs dry.  Bravo!  Keep it up.
B005V2EVBQ|4.0|This is a very good cover for your Kindle, making it less slippery and preventing it from scratches to the face. The strap provides that extra protection from a accidental drop.
B005ZMTYBY|4.0|Really enjoy the movie and having this save online to download at my convenience is great!<br />**** ***** ***** *****
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|A big improvement over old prince / princess stories where the prince is all good and the princess is passive.
B0014VQGX4|5.0|My son loves backhoes and this one is very realistic looking. It is metal but isn't all that heavy. I'm impressed
B0079R8IYW|4.0|Very good case for the price. Bought for my young sons to protect their Kindles. They figured out how to fold and use the stand features right away.
B000VBIGD6|5.0|Item was just what I wanted. Great price for the used dvd and was fun to watch over the Christmas holiday.
B0079R8KXG|4.0|This case fits my Kindle Fire perfectly! It's stylish and I love this color (red). It does everything the description states.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I love this. I can't imagine why anyone wouldn't want this on their Kindle! I like being able to see how much battery power I have.
B00A9X9VAI|5.0|I very rarely see movies in theaters because it's just too expensive and I can't afford it...but a friend of mine kept talking about Looper so I went to see it and loved it.  It reminds me a little bit of the first Terminator movie, but not as SciFi.  I almost never buy movies on Amazon because I just rent them via Instant Video.  I however am purchasing Looper as soon as it's available.  I liked it that much and can see myself watching it again every once in a while when there's nothing else on.  It's that enjoyable that even if I know what's going to happen I can see watch the movie again.  There hasn't been a movie that's come out in the last ten years that I felt like that about.<br /><br />A really, really good movie that is exciting and interesting and has a great ending that you should see before someone spoils it for you.
B008QE9XD2|4.0|Got this for my teenage daughter because she is a HUGE fan of Johnny Depp. The movie itself was cute. Funny in parts, scary in parts....and also a little vulgar in parts. My ten year old twins watched with and that was probably not a good idea. Does have more profanity than I expected and a few way too adult themed scenes. But, not a bad watch.
1439102813|3.0|This was a gift to one of my co-workers, her Mom was starting to go through Dementia, I thought this might help her, she was very grateful.
B0002IQOZA|5.0|I just love this CD. It is the second one I purchased because my original was worn out! I hope some time in the near future she puts out another Christmas CD.
030758836X|3.0|Please read my review on &#34;Dark Places&#34;, I will be giving this book another try...I have read &#34;Dark Places&#34;, currently reading &#34;Sharp Objects&#34;, so &#34;Gone Girl&#34; will be my last, I think I went backwards, but that's OK..
B00APUQT7I|3.0|As an adult I've always liked the Ice Age movies, but I didn't like this one so much. This one seems to be geared mostly to the pre-teens/teens. Peaches is attracted to a boy Mammoth, does a bad thing to her best friend, etc.. The bullying thing comes into play as well as to like others that are not of your kind,........why do they keep shoving that down peoples throats? There is still some comedy in the movie, but ........well I don't know. See for yourself if you want, but like I said mostly for the kids if you want to let them watch it. These guys can make better movies than this, and I was really hoping for a movie length Christmas Movie, the one last year of a whole 25 minutes just didn't get it!
0553801473|5.0|I waited about 6 years for this book to come out.  I'm glad that the show got green lighted and now the increased popularity of the novels finally led George RR Martin to publish this.  Hopefully, book 5 will also come out in a reasonable period of time. On the other hand, this book was totally worth the wait!  i bought it the day it came out and just locked myself away for two days to read it.  AWESOME!
B007RE0SCW|4.0|My daughter has 4 other Monster High dolls in the Dead Tired series and they all came with a stand. I'd like this one a little more if she weren't always sitting down on the job.
0618154248|4.0|My son loves Curious George so these books went over quite well. I do prefer the full stories to these shortened ones, but my son adores the stories no matter what.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|So, this app is amazing and better than temple run as it has three lanes, more obstacles, and trains that you can jump on. However, every time (at least on a kindle fire) an add for another app pops up, your device asks to force close or wait. Although you would want to say force close, click wait and close the ad. your game will start. but, it is a pain to have that. other than that, this is an amazing and very fun.
B00015YVD6|1.0|This movie is great and that is why I bought it but, for some reason, this DVD was in black and white. I returned it.
B005WUHAX8|5.0|It appealed aesthetically to my 13 year old daughter who s hard to please. Works and looks exactly as described. And most of all will protect her phone as I need.
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|It's the best CPU you can buy for less than 250$. It works perfectly, easy to install and It represents a big change, since I've upgraded from a core 2. Totally worth the 219$
B005G4TJI4|1.0|Bought this after the Digital Copy expiration date had elapsed.  Nothing on the Amazon site indicates the expiration date.  The package has this warning on both the outside and inside.  Amazon offered a full refund.  That's a stand up company in my opinion.
B002WJI65S|5.0|My kids loved the addition to this with their Mario collection.  Tis one was quality and I would recommend to anyone.
B0034DGPEU|3.0|I'm not sure what I really thought about this book.  The story is told from two women's points of view, Lavinia and Belle and follows them through when Lavinia was a child into adulthood.  There were times in the book when I couldn't decide of Lavinia was just oblivious, in denial or just dumber than a bag of rocks and made me want to scream.  I tired to feel for her and the situation she got herself into but really couldn't feel much compassion for her.  Belle, on the other hand I really liked and admired her will determination in dealing with being half white and a black slave.  If anything this books shows the need for communication among people/families. The book is well written and has a good, but depressing storyline when at times you think nothing good ever is going to happen to any of the characters.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|More fun than expected. And addicting. I'd assumeda TV tie-in app would be poorly made. One star subtracted because they kept hounding me in-game to rate the app.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|It took me a while to finally read this book because I have a habit with trilogies not to read the final book until a long time after reading the second. I never want them to end! But I just got a new Kindle and was sick from work yesterday so I read the entire thing. And I'm so glad I did! It was an action packed page turner! I read it all in one sitting because I just HAD to find out what happened! I'm not an expert on literature or writing or anything. I'm just someone who likes to read good books. If you've read the first two books you will like the third! The ending was truly truly a great ending as well. I even teared up a bit (I never do that!). I was afraid the ending was going to be similar to the Twilight ending (HATED IT) but it actually was a great ending to characters you've grown to love. I highly recommend!
B001GUXJQA|4.0|Michael Connelly has developed an oddly flawed but noble  character in Harry Bosch that I gladly follow from one tale to another. I recommend The Black Ice to other Connelly fans.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Captivating, couldn't put it down. Read it in a day! Can't wait to read the next couple of books to see what happens next!
B009LXEBD4|5.0|The Cd arrived on time and was in great condition. I like Kelly Clrkson and the quality is great. I would definitely buy more Cds .
B004AQR29C|5.0|If you are looking for adventure with all belief totally suspended, this is for you. All the good old boys join in the fun from the adventure movies of 20 years ago.
B0070Y46UY|3.0|This book was a fun, quick read that was enjoyable and kept me intrigued throughout the book. The one thing I did not like about the book was the lack of follow through in the boy's religious beliefs. I was interested to see how he carried these principles with him on his journey, but there was little tie in throughout the rest of the book.<br /><br />Would still recommend the book to anyone.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Cyber warfare is often in the news these days. Do we really know how dangerous it could be. Tom Clancy paints a scary scenario about what could happen if a state sponsored cyberattack rips into the U.S. This books has the usual cast of characters, perhaps a little bit older but much wiser. Of course we win but the warning is clear. We are vulnerable.
B007KOMTUI|5.0|i love this series....have just known of it for the last year and have seen all episodes available.  was going to wait to buy this one, wait for freebie on netflix....but i cannot know there are available episodes 'out there' and not watch.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|only thing that differs from being on Facebook on a PC is the lack of ability to 'share' a friends post. Besides that, great app!
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I enjoy playing Mahjong. Time flies by while I am playing. I have played it on my computer and I was happy to see it for the Kindle.
0307383415|4.0|Out of fairness i wanted to get a more personal feeling of at that time our President to be, so I ordered 3 books.  They were interesting. This one was the best and very lovely.  The other books only reinforced my opinion that He will take us into more government control and cost.
B00632HWOG|5.0|I like being able to see my mail even when I am not at home or at a computer. I can reply faster as well.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|If you like a light romance, you may like this one. No surprises and not very long.  It had some promise, it just needed a little more detail.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Fun but some of them are very hard. I don't reccomend it for little kids. Kids 8 and up should play.
1882723007|5.0|arrived to my house fast and not damaged. I was expecting it to take about a week but it only took a couple days.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|By far on  of the best books I've read to date, I am so<br />Excited for the movie to come out
1438819404|3.0|I really hoped, that this last one would have actual movie stills. I love mine that I got for Christms, however  I do wish it was more than just headshots and not really good ones at that. Both the Breaking Dawn Calendars and posters have been disappointing compared to the merchandise for the other films.
B00AMBK0X4|4.0|This was a good movie, pretty funny with a few WTF moments . I had no problem streaming from amazon.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I like it very much just wish that I had more time to play it.  It is like going on an adventure
B001UV4XIS|5.0|granddaughter loved it harry potter and the deathly hollows, part 2 watched it next day they are harry potter experts
B007TNS6JI|5.0|Make a class out of 4.  Play with others level up get better weapons and gear! IT IS ALSO  FREE!!! I Think it is a really good game to pass time to so go ahead Click that button.!
B005HSL626|5.0|noy sure my grand children took it home we thought it was a great gift and they put it on their list
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Amazing book!!! It is a must read!!! It will keep u on your toes and make you cry! Hope you enjoy it as much as I did
B004QX07G4|4.0|This book sounds like me on a normal day. My mind wanders so many different places, someone would probably lock me up if I said my thoughts out loud. It was a great read and I finished it in one day!!!!!!!! Kudos to Ellen!! Shes more \\"normal\\" than people thought! I have always loved her work!!!!
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|It could have<br />had a little bit of a better closing or ending.but over all great lots of jokes<br /><br />Thank you for the enjoyment
B00280LYIC|5.0|Such a great book a must read for teens that like mythology, a perfect mix of old and new stories.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|HUNGRY SHARK EVOLUTION IS A GREAT, FUN GAME WITH AMAZING GRAPHICS AND SOUND. I RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE AND EVERYONE!
B000LB7G00|3.0|I used it for the internet game Second Life.  I don't use it anymore; I prefer using my mouse instead.
B005CRQ3NY|5.0|Very good book<br />2best one I have read the 3wheel  is and it is number 1<br />Nice job Jeff  Kinney
B000U6BT40|5.0|Eureka is a fun show for the nerd in us all.  It is clean, funny, smart and just plain entertaining.
B009CGYO0K|2.0|Interesting, not funny.  Was not expecting a cartoon style story, expected a funny story.  More appropriate title would be that cats rule.
B00006CXGM|1.0|Scratched, won't play, bought new, so very upsetting, was also a gift for a special person...very disappointed.  Will be returning, and now going out to the store to purchase a trusted item.
B008YW5RH2|1.0|I downloaded the app and then tried to open it-- and it shut down each time before it would open.  I unloaded it from my phone and re-downloaded -- same issue.  I uninstalled it and installed again and again -- and every time I tried to open the app-- it unexpectedly shut down and told me to reopen it.  But I never could.  I uninstalled the doggone thing and decided to forget it.  Thank goodness it was free or I would really be annoyed.  I am annoyed-- but at least this exercise in futility did not cost me anything except my time.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Emotional rollercoaster. Sexually stimulating. Eye opening adventure. Looking forward to finishing trilogy. I see myself throughout... good job e. L. James
140132634X|5.0|I love this author and this book is simply wonderful reading. This is simply a fun story to experience and I found myself not wanting it to end. This is a book that you can read to your children and grandchildren and it is simply good old fashion entertainment. My wife and sister read the book and loved it as well which is nearly impossible for all three of us to agree on anything yet we all loved it. Time rules everything we do, ever wonder why?
B007T99ENE|3.0|Have enjoyed Ian Mc Ewans earlier books but was a lttle disappointed  with Sweet Tooth.Found it an easy read but quite predictable.
B0063IH60K|5.0|its a good way to learn the &#34;touch&#34; of an  pad typ[e device-  I had never had one befoe...my frst Kindle didn't work this way!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|It's my favorite book ...since it was the last one I read :)<br />. Now time to watch the movie .
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Great book!<br />Well written and captivating. The characters are well defined and life like, the subtle irony is amazing.  Would definitely recommend it!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I first saw this book in a commercial for the movie. I've always been told that the book is better then the movie, so I started with the book and I will watch the movie after. But once I started reading this book. It pulled me in and I couldn't stop reading. It was intriguing and made me smile and shed a tear throughout the entire thing. I highly recommend this book for teens in high school. It's very relatable and makes you really think.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Great CD. if it was vinyl it would be worn out and grooved by now. Did I just date myself.  LOVED IT ! ! !
B00280LYIM|5.0|The reason I gave it 5 stars was because Rick Riordan is my favorite author!! I love Percy ,Annabeth,Grover,Nico,and Juniper!!! I also feel sorry for Luke,Castor,and Lee. I know anybody would love this book. It takes a lot of patience to read this book. It took me 2 days to read this book on my kindle.
0439023513|5.0|I liked the whole series of these books, but I want more.  Kind of left you hanging after everything buidling up.  Maybe if they make a movie of this one too they can take it a step further.  Easy reading.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|has all type of games for everyone. some are very easy,  and some a little harder but all fun. great for all ages
0439023491|5.0|I really liked the series of books.  I also love the idea of holding a book in your hand.  This is the first time I have even bought a book and I bought all 3.  Can't wait for the movie.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Great for a quick calculator. Easy to see...easy to use. Works great on kindle fire. No problems installing. No special permissions.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Lots of fun, only complaint is wish the player had more control on the shaking. I look how the side bars come up. I rate this game a 5 out of 5. This game helps pass the time quickly ,
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|Love this app. I just wish u got more energy and u could use coins to buy it instead  of real money
B001ER4CNY|5.0|GREAT SERIES FOR A GREAT COST, AND I RECEIVED IT IN VERY GOOD CONDITIONS IN MY HOME IN MEXICO. THANKS
B009MF56GC|5.0|I bought this movie for hubby's Christmas and he loved it! The movie arrived quickly and was packaged well. A good shoot-em-up movie with all of his favorite action heros.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|Daughter asked for this for Christmas and got lucky and found it for $3.99 new. Adorable movie in perfect shape. Could not have been happier.
0062017926|5.0|Christmas present for my hubby.  He's happy.  Hasn't read it yet, but he likes the author.  Daughter recommended the book.
B004HXIZVC|1.0|I just updated soundcloud to the latest version on amazon's apps market and the app will not load. I wished I hadn't done that!
B000FC2ROU|5.0|A thouroughly fantastic ride. Murakami is a veritable genius, and this is his masterpiece. Metaphysically stimulating yet applicable to the lives of us all.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Easy to use!  My niece uses it as her 'cash register' when she plays store. I use it when shopping.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|What it isn't --- non-stop action, physical feats, guns, bombs, explosions, or youth culture driven.  What it is --- a well founded story and platform for some the best actors and actresses of our times to demonstrate their craft and draw the audience into the world they created.  A story of hard luck, disappointment, discovery, and joy and the growth of new friendships, new loves, and community that crosses culture barriers.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|What can I say? Love it. Could play all the time. Would recommend to friends and have. More like this.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|A great story for all.  The whole family have watched from 10 to 70-something and we all enjoyed it.  Not just for girls, but a story for boys as well.
B002PQ7JQK|5.0|Seeing the enhanced version on blu-ray is fantastic! Like watching a brand new version of the series. The clarity and colors are amazing. The price was great (got it on 1 day gold box sale!) and I would recommend this set to any true Star Trek fan.
B00AMBK6J2|1.0|Very vulgar, childish and offensive humor. Hard to believe the actors would accept a role in this type of project.
B005HT400A|4.0|This is one David Lynch film you have to see. It is so wierd that it's great. On blu-ray even better.
B009738XXM|2.0|She's adorable, and only a mean monster can resist &#34;Call Me Maybe,&#34; but if you've heard that and her &#34;Good Time&#34; collaboration with Owl City, you've heard all you need from this album.  Lots of filler where she sings OK but the songs are duds.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I gave a Fire to my girlfriend - totally computer illiterate.  She played solitaire for hours last night and now can turn the Fire off and on, change the orientation and select her game.  Very nice.
B00ADYYBFI|5.0|Most stuff that passes for \\"country\\" is just rock or pop music with a twang. I like Blake Shelton as much as the next guy, and he cranks out some reliably catchy stuff, and he has about 100x the soul and depth of Shania Twain or Kenny Chesney. But while Blake is a likable guy with strong albums, his music isn't focused on the strife, struggle, pain, and reflection that has been the hallmark of classic country music. That genuine feel can take many musical forms and still be authentic -- Hank Sr, Laura Cantrell, George Jones, Patsy Cline, Jamey Johnson, Loretta Lynn, Charlie Rich, Hank Jr, Robbie Fulks, Freddy Fender.<br /><br />There are some very remarkable aspects to the music from this smart and slick soap opera. First, it's sung by the actors -- Hayden Panettiere, Connie Britton, and others. Now I know that everybody in show buisness can sing and dance, but they both sound like genuince country singers. Britton is competent, like Sissy Spacek was in Coal Miner's Daughter, but Hayden is remarkable. I think she has a career in country music if she wants it; I like her better than big stars like Carrie Underwood, because she has great nuance in her vocals.  Second, the music is \\"modern\\" in its clean production values, but it touches the heart musically and lyrically in the style of classic country. So it's not just throwback stuff (even though that can be very good, as Lee Ann Womack demonstrated in 2005 with \\"There's More Where That Came From\\").<br /><br />I love this stuff. Why don't we hear THIS on the radio instead of the twang pop?
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It was the coolest book I've ever read. I really enjoyed the hunger games. Written by the outrageous Susan Collins
0793518326|3.0|good but text needs to be bigger and they need to bind it so the pages turn easily and stay there.
B008KRJWEK|3.0|The game is good but zombie highway is way better. The mutants are not very well at tipping your car.
B005K2YRVG|5.0|My Kindle fits inside perfectly and is secure in my hand bag or brief case. This is a terrific product at a very reasonable price.
B005CRQ4GU|3.0|It was a very good book but I was highly disappointed with it. the whole book was just totally of topic compared to the other books in this series. I was also very disappointed with the ending because the whole book was supposed to be about Greg finding a date to the valentines day dance and I thought it would be funny, but tome it was more stupid than funny I do not recommend this book if you want to check a good diary of a wimpy kid book I would highly recommend you read dog days or Rodrick rules peace out guys.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|This is a very good mobile software for nexus 7. Very intuitive and easy to use. Easy navigation and ease of use is a plus.

B0090P98Z4|5.0|this is a fun game. an interesting concept. I have enjoyed it so far and look forward to playing it more in the future.
B000L53D4O|5.0|My grandson loves this walker.  He pushes it all over the house.  The activities are not required but maybe if he got it earlier he would have played with them.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This book was a great read and a rather easy read also. Great for one looking for a great romance novel and fulfills your missing relationship status.
B00AHSMDQY|1.0|I'm a big amazon fan however I was not impressed with the quality of the HD movie I rented.<br />I never rented a move from amazon before so I desided to give it a shot boy was I wrong!<br />I have a Samsung HDMI top of the line tv and the move still looked like crap. The sound was distorted and way off I had to put the volume of my TV to almost a 100 just to hear it, the Amazon HD was a joke, and everything in the movie looked wired shaped.<br />I order the movie again on VUDO and it was amazing boy what a diffrence! Stick with VUDO for renting movies
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Finished the first book yesterday and can't believe how good this one is. Speechless is not the word for he enthralled with these books I am!
B003ODIZL6|1.0|I hate this book I'm going to delete this book because it's so so so boring I don't think that people would read this
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Having had a similar experience, this book was very meaningful to me.  I would recommend it to anyone who has lost a loved one.  I believe the soul lives on and believing in God makes all the difference when our souls leave this earthly plane.  This is a peaceful loving experience which words cannot fully explain.  This book is a blessing.
B009JZPH32|3.0|All i can say is soft core. I doesnt make sense and its random. I watched the whole thing anyways.
B006TTC5JK|5.0|The Blu-ray version is outstanding.  My four year old granddaughter loves it and can't stop talking about the Pooka.  Great movie addition to any collection
B0063IH60K|4.0|The only problem I have with this app is the constant ads.  Yes, you can<br />skip them, but is very annoying to have to do after every game.  Otherwise, if you can get past that it's a good app.
B005WUHAX8|5.0|I bought this for my 15 year old daughter for Christmas. It's her favorite gift. She loves that it's slimmer than her old Otter Box and the outer shell doesn't grab her hair and clothes.  I love that it provides more protection than the Otter Box (which was falling apart!)
B005OCFHHK|2.0|Bought this set on impulse at Costco a month or so ago. Just started watching them this past week. So far have watched the first 3 titles.<br /><br />I use a PS3 as my blu-ray player. So far the first 3 titles have no menu. They just go right into the movie. My complaint is the audio and video quality. These are poor conversions. The video quality is not as good as streaming Vudu HDX. There was significant compression artifacts in \\"The Prisoner of Azkaban\\". Kind of like what you would see on most streaming versions like Amazon or Netflix. Vudu HDX has nearly no compression artifacts.<br /><br />The audio is another big disappointment. Where's the master, uncompressed audio that is supposed to be on blu-ray? I get plain old DD. I guess this goes along with the poor compressed video.<br /><br />Bottom line, these discs are nothing more than slightly enhanced DVDs converted into pseudo blu-rays so that WB can make a few more bucks selling \\"better\\" versions.<br /><br />If you already have the DVD versions save your money these are hardly an upgrade. If you don't have any you would be better off buying from Vudu, Apple or Amazon. At least then you get the ability to watch on portable devices.
B00AMBH70S|4.0|Good action movie with good acting and stunt work.  Amazing chase scenes but very similar to the original Bourne trilogy.
1476712042|3.0|I give this book 3.5 stars for a good reason.<br />It wasn't too awful/horrible, but it certainly wasn't the best book I've read. There were certain things I did like about the book. I can fully understand there relationship was beautiful, but at the same time a disaster all stirred in a pot. However, I couldn't stand Travis's anger problems. Sure, all guys-especially alpha guys-tend to overreact and become totally overprotective of their girls, but the way Travis handled the other guys through brutal means of violence was definitely not attractive. It's excusable if a guy touches their girl inappropriately, but even one stare or a joke shouldn't push Travis over the edge to beat someone up until blood is evident. It's absolutely crazy. He should've been suspended ages ago, but of course this book is fiction and every author have their imaginative ways of telling their stories, so overall I do not have anything rude to say to or about the author.<br />The majority of the story was predicatable, but I didn't like what happened near the end, considering the romance was rushed and not taken somewhat slow. However youngsters believe when the time is right, it's right and of course parental reasoning is not going to persuade them to take a different path.<br />Abby was okay, but not someone I clearly admired. I didn't care for her best friend at some points throughout the story. Finch and Shepley were decent enough for me. As for Travis, he's not the kind of guy I would date. There are times I thought \\"take a chill pill, dude.\\" I've been in college and if some guy acted the way he did, he would've been put out a long time ago. But BD is fiction, so I'm not going to go any further.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This book was well written. The author created likable and realistic characters. The male lead in this book was smart, handsome, funny, sweet and kind. The female lead was smart and quick witted, I liked her as well. I will purchase other works by this author every time I see her listed. GREAT BOOK!
B005HSL626|5.0|It is fun. slicing fruit is fun.don't hit the bombs. good times during christmas vacation while at home in the country.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|Husband is a HUGE fan of this series-  He' loves it!!!!  Couldn't wait to get into the box and start watching!
B00632HWOG|5.0|this app is very important to me so i was excited to see it available thru my son's kindle fire HD
B004C4IKCU|5.0|I am so glad I purchased this CD.  Many of the songs I had not heard before.  How did that happen??  It stays in my car CD player.  It is easy listening driving to all my activities.  Takes me away from the madness of the expressway driving.  Elvis was just one of the all time greats.  His voice was incredible and timeless.  In my world, Elvis never left.  His gospel CD's are a must have too.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I won't go into great detail other than I read this book in one night and I really enjoyed Charlie and clueless and normal his family was.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|All of us like this game - I almost like it better than angry birds I think :) Has the same laws of physics that you need to figure out as with angry birds
B00914JWSW|5.0|Such a powerful voice these songs will live on forever.  I had to read the cover as most of these songs are so pitch perfect and sound of the much younger Streisand. The CD is really nice.
B000N3ST7A|4.0|This album is a very good one to have for those who like Stevie Nicks.  The insight into each of the songs on the albam provided by the cover booklet was outstanding.
0316789720|5.0|My grandchildren, ages 8 and 6, love this book.  It uses simple shapes to teach kids how to draw, step-by-step.  From alligators to cars, trains, boats...dinosaurs... this easy to use book is terrific.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I would highly recommend this book, catches your emotions and you can't put it down! Catching Fire is in my opinion the best of the trilogy!
B007IXWKUK|3.0|I was very unhappy with the first installment of this trilogy, but after much urging from friends and co-workers I went ahead and purchased book two. While the writing itself is not horrible, I simply can't get out of my mind that if an innocent girl was to be put in this situation she would never, ever, be able to have a normal relationship in her whole entire life. That's really sad. I've tried to keep an open mind, but I still feel that this series is pretty offensive. I don't find any of it sexy or arousing in any way. I've read some pretty crazy,sleazy,way-out-there romances but no series has actually offended me before. I've either liked or disliked the writing style or the story itself. I don't see myself reading book three, though it does leave me fairly curious as to how E L James wraps this whole story up. If I'd read this when I was younger it may not have affected me the same way it does now that I've experienced more things in life. If the series is made into a movie, I don't believe I could stomach watching it. It's not the actual BDSM that bothers me, it's all the messed up psychological issues behind it.
B0062KJ198|4.0|This is an amusing movie. The actors are great and I enjoyed the special humor. I would watch it again
B00A757EFW|5.0|This is one of my favorite games because its so competitive with myself. I recommend for<br />anyone for a pass time.
B008UJDOOC|5.0|awesome item, arrived very quickly and would definately recommend to all my friends and family. daughter loves this item. Great
B0051UP5NQ|1.0|Understanding that every user has different needs, some or none of what I say may apply to you. I needed this app to allow me to open, edit, and save my Microsoft Word documents in the same format as they were created. This app converts all documents to straight text, and all formatting and styles are lost. When I called Amazon tech support for help, I was told that the app is \\"basically a notepad.\\" That was really discouraging, being that I paid $14.99 for it. If I want a straight text document, I could use Google Docs for free. Ironically, Google Docs supports Microsoft Word documents in all their glory. So, I feel I was ripped off. My loss, but the lesson was well learned.
B004JZBGWI|3.0|I find Color Notes very practical and attractive but cannot figure out how to use the calendar. I went on line to search for User Manual and found the most awful garbage: different vendors trying to sign me up for one thing or another. Manual would make it 5 star.<br />Very disappointing!
B004EPYZUS|4.0|I got this for my son.  I guess we are just tired of the same ole story line.  But it was action packed.
0743201140|5.0|It is important to know your strengths and how to maximize them in the workplace and at home. Also we need to recognize our weaknesses to make the adjustments needed
B000VHXBIU|1.0|Sometimes coming  up with 20 words for these reviews is hard.  This movie can be summed up in one word: STUPID.  I had high hopes for it, given the stellar cast and the great reviews on here, but I for one will NEVER watch this turkey again. There is not one laugh in the entire movie.
B004H51706|5.0|If you own Bruder trucks then you know and wouldnt be reading this. If you are looking, then you are in the right place. Ignore the price. These things are very high quality and will last for years. Yes, your 4 y/o will lose the side mirrors and small things, but years later they will still be playing with these long after the cheaper trucks are landfilled.Hands down the most detailed and enjoyable toys we own. I will continue to buy until he discovers girls.....
B00AECGQF2|5.0|well I am trying to get this app and my kindle fire wont let me so people this app might be fun but I don't know that.
0385535147|5.0|John Grisham does it again. This is a great book!  I read it while traveling over the holidays and couldn't put it down. If you love Grisham, you must read this book.
B00AIQP9DE|2.0|Got the app loved the game , played for three days on and off , now app won't  open just freezes and then closes :(
B00004TH83|5.0|I love this artist and I wish she would record more albums in ENGLISH!!.  PLEASE!!!!! Her lyrics are simply the best.
B002436WFI|5.0|The color of magic was my first and favorite book to read but with the movie they mixed The Color of Magic and the second book of the series The Light Fantastic which makes for a very long two disk movie. I loved how true they stayed to the books and took the time to make a excellent cast. Many famous faces pop up into the movie for cameos. Made me laugh and entertained my family to become a family favorite for movie nights.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|After enrolling in Amazon Prime, the first thing I noticed is the lower prices of ebooks as compared to other ebook retailers. I do like reading the books I bought and reading them on my smartphone gives new meaning to pocket books...5 stars
B00APUQPX6|4.0|Great movie for cuddle time with five and a half year old. Lots of giggles. Fun, cute and not too long.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|The game is interesting, has witty little sayings and is also challenging.<br />It's addicting and also requires you to think about how to build and maneuver the goo balls. Very interesting
B009YX02T8|5.0|This album is awesome! Another great soundtrack from the twilight saga. Every artist on this alum is wonderful and the songs they chose go perfectly with the movie.
B005RDF2RG|4.0|somewhat unsuitable for kids younger than 13<br />ok moview<br />somewhat unsuitable for kids younger than 13<br />ok movie<br />Shrek 2
B004LWZWGA|4.0|I would like to make it simple, if you enjoy the first two films like I do, this is must have. Like many reviewers have stated, style of the third film is quite different from first two. First, there is too much light, they show too much of batman, he became less mysterious. Second, they have a background story for the villains, little bit of detective element, in my opinion, it's overkill. It doesn't matter what their origins are, the batman should simply just take them down.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book was one of my favs of 2012! It made you think and was overall a great read for most. The characters were fun, enjoyable, and relatable. it was so entertaining that I literally could not put it down; as a result I finished in less than a week. I found it interestingly unique how they left things unsaid and made the story amazing but that never made it confusing. I made the mistake of seeing the movie before the book, and although the movie was executed well, I'd still read the book first, which seems to be the case with most book-movie pairs. I, as a tween, found some parts to be intimate, so I'd defenitely say the age range would be 12+, unless you are a very mature 11 year old. This was a great read and if you are reading this, pondering about getting a copy, I'd say go for it and purchase this amazing read!
B00AMBLDEE|5.0|Definitely a movie to add to my favorite list.  I will recommend to my family and friends. A must see by everyone!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|nice app easy to use with precise weather and yes i would recommend it to friends for all weather needs
B00A3DZ61W|3.0|This game plays similar to the other Angry Birds games.  If you like them you should like this.  The Star Wars theme was cute too.
B0095J0AL6|5.0|My daughter loves One Direction and this was a very good gift for her.  She really appreciates the yearbook and the bands comments inside.  It is a treat for 1D fans.
B007TML4EI|4.0|I enjoyed playing this for what little time I had it.  As is typical with most games I have played on my phone though, the levels go from really easy, to easy, to frustrating pretty quickly.  That is when I uninstall.
B005RUV0NY|5.0|Walking dead is good to watch if your a fan of zombies..  I am still impressed on how the plot holds threw out the season..
B00AHSIQWE|2.0|my husband, my daughter and me all fell asleep!  too hard to follow, much darker than the typical Batman movie.  The villan's story was confusing, and sort of a mystery until the end.  When his story was revealed the villain went from a leader to a lost little puppy in a second.  We didnt like it at all.
B003RGTIIY|4.0|Downloads are fast and easy...  Adding more to my collection.  What else is there to say. If you like them you like them if not well you don't.
B009IRVSVQ|1.0|After wearing out the first Bruno album and waiting impatiently for the 2nd to arrive, I have to say I was disappointed. Most of the songs were pretty ordinary and it's as if he used up all his good material on album 1. Really, Gorilla???? And while his first single is good I coulda used a few less \\"oooohhh's\\" in it. Really distracting and annoying. And a lot more adult \\"sex\\" type songs in this one.  Really. I think I'll stash this away to collect dust....there's a lot more better stuff to listen to.
B006BXTOFC|4.0|Downloads are fast and easy...  Adding more to my collection.  What else is there to say. If you like them you like them if not well you don't.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I work at a movie  theatre so I watched the movie before I read this. Anytime Patrick was mentioned, I thought \\"Ezra Miller is the  perfect person to portray the  person.\\"  It is also a very relatable book and I found  myself tearing up for the latter half of it because I do have a lot of  those those thoughts where you truly want everyone to be happy yet you find yourself torn because your closest friends are leaving and other things of that nature. I feel that Charlie didn't really have a bizarre life, he was just misunderstood.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Walking dead is good to watch if your a fan of zombies..  I am still impressed on how the plot holds threw out the season..Reminds me of what the New World Order wants to due with us...
B004SRNH10|3.0|I had to also download this app for my Ridgid bubble level to work properly. I only know my bubble level works fine.
B005CRQ4OW|5.0|This book was amazing and funny.it really brought out the relationship between two children.I recommend this book to children who love comedies and who sometimes have friend problems.
B005IQZB14|2.0|I really can't get into this book.  I am supposed to be reading it for a book club which meets today, and I'm only on chapter 5.  I keep picking it up to read and get frusrated.  I know she lost her mother; it is mentioned at the very beginning of the book.  The author does not have to keep going back to that over and over again.  Get on with the story  . . . . but that seems to be too much to ask.  I don't enjoy reading about people who are obviously lacking in self esteem and/or self control.  I want to tell her to &#34;suck it up&#34; and get one with your life.<br />Jo
B00APUQH0W|5.0|Eastwood and Amy Adams shine in this heart- string jerker .  Even Timberlake is tolerable . Amazon Prime free HD stream completed the deal!
B0063IH60K|4.0|I started playing this game and can't stop.  I don't like the ads that I have to delete every time I start a new game, but I guess that is the price to pay for a FREE game.
B0098VXBIA|4.0|This movie was far better than the previews. Funny and real. Warning - it has some harsh moments that may be hard for anyone who has struggled for their take home baby.
B00009NQQO|4.0|I just have to put it in the tub...for some reason my boys just wanted to play with the balls outside of the tub.
B0063IH60K|3.0|This app is a descent enough game but as so many wants you to upgrade to rid yourself of the persistent ads. It is worth checking out, but compare with other options.
B0061S073A|5.0|I just got a Kindle fire for Christmas and my kids ages 4 and 6 like to use it. Kids Place is a great way to let them use my kindle without having to worry about them buying other apps or using the internet. I like it better than Kindle Free time. The only thing I wish is that you could add books as well as apps. For a free app it doesn't get better than this!
B002M9FYO4|5.0|Love this album.nice and clear,I was not expecting it to be a HDCD nice. These cd's are good but not as good as the MO-FI Gold.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|The story line was exciting and made me continue to read but I felt as if it was lacking a crucial element.
B000007492|5.0|A lot of good songs on this cd,if you like Supertramp you will love this cd I do.The remastering is good to it sounds pretty clean,but then again Supertramp always had good recordings.
B006ZDS7CE|5.0|I love Lana Del Rey, and so do both my kids (8 and 13) great music for a great price!!
B000008CSO|5.0|Had not listened to it before.after purchasing it had to here it again and again.The clarity of these gold disks is awesome,they are so clean it make you want to replace your whole music collection,they are that good.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Super Funny and Entertaining! It's a must see. Especially if you love music. It kept my attention the entire time.
B007ZGBZHE|4.0|Kept me on the edge of my seat and unable to put it down. Preston and Child have done it again!
B009MCRHH6|5.0|I have really enjoyed playing this game. It is not so easy that intrest is lost but not so hard that it takes more than a few tries to find the solution. I look forward to the hummor of &#34;the sign painter&#34; in each new level.
B005GRTNVE|5.0|Il Divo still the best group, they are talented, charming and they always choose their songs very good and the music
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|I love this movie, it is funny, sad, happy, and heartwarming. I'm so glad I own it, so I can watch it over and over again.
B003H4I4JU|4.0|It wasn't as good as Ender's Game, but the story was still a very good read. I love to get to see character development like this. Seeing Ender speak for the dead was actually a really amazing read. I wish we had something like it in real life.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this game it's so fun flow free is a game where you are strategizing and thinking the whole time I love this game
B005HSG3TC|5.0|I thought that the kindle cover I purchased through Amazon was an exceptional value and the quality is as good as you would find in any department store without the hassle of going out to the store.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Enjoy this games, put together really user friendly. I have played this game on my Apple I touch but it is not as easy to play as the one from Amazon.
B00913DPW2|5.0|WOW!!! that was a challenge!!! but it was great...really made me think...I told myself I wasn't going to use the cheat but MAN this game is hard!!! definitely worth the $1.99... downloading the haunt 2 right now. buy it, you won't be disappointed!!!
B009FZFONO|5.0|I started watching this series a couple of days ago when I was home sick. Perhaps not the best choice under the circumstances but, hey, I was pretty sure I only FELT like dying. I never read the graphic novels so know nothing of that story and how it plays out.<br /><br />Watching Rick Grimes start off as The Sheriff in the White Hat who has to change to match the times is fascinating. The writers aren't taking it easy on him, that's for sure.<br /><br />This 3rd season seems to be a great deal more about the living than the dead and that's a good thing. My fascination with this series is entirely about how the characters deal with the zombie apocalypse and each other. It's the human aspects that grab and hold and bore into my brain like the zombie virus thing.<br /><br />Introducing new characters helps keep the story alive. I won't add anything beyond that.<br /><br />If you like distopian dramas this is for you!
B005LAIH2W|5.0|So many movies today look more like a video game and dont have much of a story - just alot of fight and chase scenes.  Although I have never read the Mars books, I am a SCIFI fan and I really enjoyed this movie.  A really great mix of action and story line along with some good special effects and well laid out characters.  Saw it in the movies and just bought the hubby the DVD for a gift.  Liked it even better watching it a second time.
B005DOL0R0|3.0|Its a SLEEVE, it was ok. I really have not thought about it. Its a SLEEVE, its ok for what its use for.
B008CP6RWU|3.0|I played and beat Journey (in one sitting), the graphics were beautiful.  The character is a bedouin infant who learns about there purpose through a series of &#34;levels.&#34;  The wayfarer is likeable,and relatable to the human experience desired when making the game.  The music is where the real genius is!  Sound is used like radar to find your accompliace.  Nobody can cus you out like multiplayer shooters.  Collaboration is the best way to proceed through the vast environments.  There is NO DEATH in this game.  That is not to say there are no enemies.<br />The soundtrack is nice and the commentary was about 30 minutes worth.<br />No spoilers here (you can thank me by saying this review is helpful).<br /><br />Flow- This is where you are comparible to plankton.  Your goal is to eat red colored planton and not get eaten by bigger planton/creatures.  There is some advancement where you can become a jelly-fish style gourmond here.  'that is about it.<br /><br />Flower-  It doesn't work for me.  The whole &#34;aftertouch&#34; system used in heavenly Sword also known as &#34;six-axis&#34; shaking of the entire controller is supposed to make tghe game work and it doesn't work for me at all.  I have a DS3 (standard Ps3 controller) and my game seems broken.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Fast read, great author, couldn't put it down.  I read it in 24 hours.  It was that good! Thanks Gillian!
B004QL7K8E|5.0|I love this movie so much I want to throw a Party just like it. I was a great movie I love it
0385336950|4.0|The Cloud Atlas is a wonderful combination of a little known piece of World War II history, a coming of age story, a glimpse at pre-statehood Alaska, a meeting of cultures and magical realism.  Our book club discussion was one of the top ones we've had in 18 years.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|I spent my teenage years (in the nineties) listening to the wonderful lyrics and resonance of this artist. As all teenagers do, I thought I was original, much to my disgust - my uncle blew a hole in that world-view, when he told me that he had Rodriguez' LP. Which he had bought in the early 80's.<br /><br />This music is of a timeless place that reflects the mood of at least two generations.
B009JBWOU0|3.0|** This is not a review of the movies **  Chances are that if you're looking at this, you're already familiar with the movies or at least have heard how good they are.  This review is only for the box set.<br /><br />The box set comes with a tri-fold cardboard case for the 3 disks.  I haven't looked through each one to see if they include bonus materials but the production description says they do.  It also comes with a small glossy booklet with some behind the scenes pictures.  The front cover of the box (pictured) is \\"holographic\\" and changes between the posters from the 3 movies as you look at it from different angles.<br /><br />This package also comes with streaming versions of the movies via UltraViolet which is accessible through Flixster.  I already had a Flixster account before buying this so I didn't go through the signup step.  But I tried to redeem the movies using the code on Christmas day and had a lot of problems.  Maybe there were a lot of people doing it or just server problems at the time (like Netflix was having too).  But it did eventually work and I can see the 3 movies on my list of \\"movies I own\\".  I've also tried to watch them through Flixster on my iPad (1st Gen).  It's a bit buggy.  The app crashed a few times.  Sometimes the movie didn't load and I had to try reloading.  But in general, it does seem to work.  And I can probably play it on my iPhone at a cafe.<br /><br />Originally I gave it 4 out of 5 for a nice box and streaming.  Updated to 3 out of 5 due to lack of special features as pointed out by another customer.

B0051ANPZQ|5.0|THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS EVER WRITTEN!!!!!!!! I LOVED IT!!!!!!! IT WAS AWESOME!!!!!!!! IT WAS SO HEART WARMING!!!!!!! I LOVED IT !!!!!!!!!!! BEST······ BOOK········EVER!!!!!!!
B005EGXNLS|4.0|The book isn't amazing; it isn't great literature, but if you've read the rest of the series, then you won't be disappointed. Cornwell delivers once again what his fans have learned to expect.
B002N44XSG|5.0|This is an awesome book. It's super cool. I really like it. Rick riordan is one great author. I love Percy Jackson books.
B003TSEEDY|3.0|I like that this story felt so real. I really appreciated the idea that we are a combination of our past, our perceptions and our hopes.
B004XJRQUQ|3.0|The Story line is OK, It could of had more meat to it.  Then ending was terrible, and predicable, I was just expecting more.
B006AX6ONI|3.0|The book was good, but did not provide me with any new value. Nonetheless, being an IU student it was a fun read how he came from nothing. Very inspiring
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Hard to believe but it is even better than the first.  I'm not sure who E L James is but OMG what a mind.  Please please don't stop writing at the end of the trilogy. And let me hurry out of.this. The third book is waiting to be purchased and downloaded!  Again. WOW!!
B00A80SHFM|3.0|I have been a big fan of Les Mis since I first saw it about 15 years ago.  I own several different recordings, including the Complete Symphonic, Original Broadway, 15th Anniversary and 25th Anniversary - as well as the French Concept Album and one of the Japanese cast recordings.  That is my point of reference which I am comparing this album to.<br /><br />Please note that I have not watched the movie, just listened to the soundtrack, and my review is not of the movie, just the soundtrack.  I do plan to see the movie, and hopefully the acting and cinematography will help smooth over some of the rougher edges.<br /><br />Other reviewers have complained about the selection of songs on this album - how can you have a \\"highlight\\" album without \\"A Little Fall of Rain\\"?<br /><br />When I first started listening, the first thing I noticed was that they changed some of the words in \\"Look Down\\" - I suppose to clarify better what the yellow ticket of leave means.  I didn't hear any other obvious changes - besides the addition of \\"Suddenly\\".<br /><br />Hugh Jackman is a passable Valjean - certainly nowhere near the quality of any of the other English recordings I've listened to.  He sort of grew on me as I listened to it.  I give his performance 3 stars.<br /><br />Anne Hathaway as Fantine blew me away - I've never heard a more emotional performance of \\"I Dreamed a Dream\\".  Her singing isn't top notch, but her expression more than made up for it.  5 stars.<br /><br />Russell Crowe as Javert.... 1 star, if even.  \\"The Confrontation\\" and \\"Stars\\" were almost painful to listen to.  I really resent the fact that the casting of this movie didn't go by talent for this crucial role...<br /><br />I was very pleased that the actors for Enjolras, Marius, Cossette and Eponine were not big names, and seemed to actually be cast based on talent.  I've heard better and worse for all those parts in various cast recordings and live performances I've seen, so I give those portions 4 stars.
B009UX2YAC|2.0|My grandson was setting up my Kindle and he downloaded this free of charge.  Can't way I will ever use it so can't say I should be reviewing it!  If he ever uses it, I will let you know.
B00A6N8F4Y|1.0|I can't believe people waste time making such movies, and worse we pay to watch them. I'm equally guilty for watching.
B002HJ9PTO|1.0|Product was faulty on arrival. Tested battery with voltmeter and was providing a current so that was not the issue.<br /><br />Tried in both PC, recording equipment and telephone. Worked in no devices tested.

0345531965|5.0|Num escrit&oacute;rio, um homem rico e muito zangado, de 78 anos, est&aacute; reescrevendo seu testamento, furiosamente.<br />Sua morte se dar&aacute; dentro de horas, e Troy Phelan quer mandar uma mensagem para seus filhos, 3 ex-mulheres e amigos e colaboradores - uma mensagem que ir&aacute; iniciar uma batalha legal e transformar dezenas de vidas, numa est&oacute;ria de pecado e redenção.<br />O novo testamento de Troy traz uma grande surpresa - um novo herdeiro para a sua fortuna de 11 bilhões de d&oacute;lares - a filha ileg&iacute;tima - uma misteriosa mulher chamada Rachel Lane, uma m&eacute;dica mission&aacute;ria que vive nas profundezas do Brasil.<br />Nate O'Riley &eacute; um advogado corporativo alco&oacute;latra, que foi chamado para o trabalho de achar Rachel Lane, a qualquer custo, e que &eacute; levado a uma renovação espiritual.<br />Enquanto os herdeiros de Troy rodeiam como abutres, Nate penetra na selva amazônica, num mundo onde o dinheiro não tem valor; onde a morte &eacute; apenas uma questão de tempo; e onde uma mulher perseguida por inimigos (e \\"amigos\\") guarda outras surpresas.<br />Depois de um tempo no Pantanal de Mato Grosso, ele encontra Rachel, vivendo junto a uma tribo ind&iacute;gena e espalhando a palavra de Deus.

Portanto, se você est&aacute; procurando alimento para a alma e uma forma de mudar as perspectivas de sua vida, leia este livro!
B000OZ0NXA|3.0|Just like the movies, this novel unrolls intensely, with the hero (Jack Reacher) not sure at first how he got involved in this small town's drama, then learning his own brother is one of the many gruesomely murdered.  Takes a while to figure out who all the bad guys are and why the local citizens just seem to exist as if on the drug, Soma.  A fast read, snappy dialogue, vivid descriptions of action.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|I got this app for kindle fire. It is quite a bit faster to log in to Facebook with this app than going over the web. Quick and easy access!

B003O86FMW|5.0|This book was a great sequel to the first Hunger Games book. At points in the book you may catch yourself tearing up a little. Things may get confusing but everything will clear up in the end. It will shock a lot of readers.
B008YU0AOE|5.0|This calculator is easy to use and has large numbers.  I thought that this was a Great app and its Free!
B007TNS6JI|4.0|I really like this game. One of the best action games I've played on a tablet in a while now
B002PEP4U0|5.0|An awesome true life story on resilience, love and hard work. A great read to get one out of the victim state of mind and the get one into the fighter state of mind.
B004EFYZ1C|5.0|I find this app easy to use and intutive. The daily function with details is very informative and the monthly view is useful for planning and calendar making.
B004XWMXW4|5.0|This was a Christmas gift for my son.  He had heard them on the radio and loved their music.  He was really excited to get this CD. I would recommend this to anyone.

0374214913|4.0|What a clever, fun novel!  It is peopled with Silicon Valley types, and the wonderful Mr. Penumbra, and spiced with the occasional memorable phrase:  \\"He works with crazy intensity, feeding hours like dry twigs into the fire ...\\".  \\"In the unpredictable fluid dynamics of middle school ....(referring to popularity)\\".  \\"My limbic system has grown accustomed to a certain very low level of human (female) contact\\".  \\"The thinnest dendrils of dawn are creeping in from the east.  People in New York are softly starting to tweet\\".<br /><br /> Spoiler alert.  I appreciated that Clay and Kat do not end up together.  As far as I understand the key, I see no reason why the Googlers could not have solved the code, possibly missing the message implied by the order in which the letter punches are stored.
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|The game itself is great, having enjoyed Angry Birds on other devices. However, on my Kindle Fire HD, the game consistently crashes every few bird launches. This is yet another entry on the list of Kindle Fire's  shortcomings, a list that fitfully grows with each use.
B004M9ZI0M|5.0|Excellent movie, it was welll worth the wait to get it for Christmas. I am very glad to have it in my collection.
B005HSL626|5.0|This game is awesome. I love playing it and my friends do as well. I would definitely recommend this for people of all ages.
B0030V0PEW|5.0|Useful for anyone grappling with errors that cause major outcome issues in complex processes from technology, aviation, medical, and other points of view.
0765348276|3.0|I read good reviews on the internet about this book in which the author was compared to Heinlein and Haldeman. Unfortunately this book is just a shadow of those authors. I must agree with another reviewer that stated that the first few chapters were really great but then the book just ran out of steam. To me it's as if the writer was reading The Forever War page by page as he wrote this book. It's not a bad story. Just not in the same class as Star Ship Troopers or The Forever War. I was also some what surprised by the number of high marks here given for this book. I really wanted to like this novel but I just couldn't. And I so wanted to find a new author.
B0079R8IYW|5.0|I purchased this for my son for Christmas, along with a new Kindle Fire. It is very nice - and my son loves it.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|good game! Have fun hacking slashing and blowing up your enemies,  good graphics with fun equipment. upgrades. fun to play without being too complicated .
B005LAIHZY|5.0|Absolutley love this movie!  I'm a big fan of Disney movies anyway, but they really went all out on this one.  The details in the CG are just outstanding, the voices were wonderful and a great story line.
B003B02O7I|5.0|This book is not your typical John Grishom book.  The content is deeper, more spiritual.  Very good message, told in a way that is respectful toward Christianity.  Told in an entertaining way that keeps you turning pages late at night when you know you really should go to bed.  Grishom's No. 1 book IMHO?  Why, The Firm, of course.  That book NEVER gets old!  And, neither does The Testament.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Let me start by saying that in the time I've had my Kindle, I've read nearly 100 books, and this is the first one I've felt compelled to write a review about. Don't get me wrong, I've thought about others, but none have compared to Hopeless. I enjoy a variety of genres such as comedies, dramas, legal thrillers, romance, erotica, etc. This book had it all!! I've never felt like I was part of a book before, never felt like I was reading a true story, never felt so connected to the characters, and never wanted to re-read it over and over again.<br /><br />Hopeless is a dramatic and beautifully composed work of art. The characters are real and genuine, and I found myself so immersed in the book that I obsessed about it while working in between finishing it! I kept thinking about the book, unable to wait to get home to finish reading it. The love, anguish, intensity, passion and fear are palpable. Just when I thought I knew what was going to happen, I was shocked by the turn of events. Not shocked in a bad or good way, but shocked in that I never imagined the plot twist in all my daydreams about Hopeless while I was working yesterday. When I got to work this morning, I left sticky notes on the desks of all my book-loving coworkers desks with the title and author and told them they HAVE to read it. I even offered to buy it for them!<br /><br />With all the emotions this book brought me through, I was very pleased with the ending as well. There was no cliffhanger, no nice and neat bow wrapped around a HEA ending. It just ended. It didn't cut off abruptly or leave me hanging, but left me at peace with the story, but still keeps me hopeful that one day the author will revisit the characters I fell in love with and share more of their story as time progresses.<br /><br />If you enjoy a well written story full of emotion and passion, YOU MUST READ THIS BOOK!! DO NOT HESITATE, DO NOT KEEP BROWSING, BUY IT NOW! You'll thank me later, I promise. Enjoy!
B0053O89WY|5.0|It is a great collection of one of the best shows on TV. Great value and a great way to catch up on past episodes.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Very enjoyable for fans of the series.  Highly reccomended. Well written, I finished this in 1 day.  Not much else to say..
B009SJ3H8Q|4.0|I am enjoying this series so far.  However, I think it's more spread out than season 1.  There's a lot going on and I'm waiting for it all to come together.  I must admit, Season 1 seemed a bit scarier though.  More tension building vs shock value and gore.  One of the things I am having major problems with though is the direction.  At times I feel as if I am watching a music video with all the choppy editing and weird camera filters.  This doesn't build tension in the story, just get's annoying and feels disjointed.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Wonderful and sexy love story. Did not want to put it down. A must read book. I loved it a lot
B008XNZMOU|1.0|I tried my hardest to like this album because I am or was a huge Taylor Swift fan. But I couldn't... This album just sucks. Speak Now is my all time favorite album next to Fearless.
B0009WFFS6|5.0|\\"Royal Albert Hall London May 2-3-5-6, 2005 is the live recording of the Cream reunion at the Royal Albert Hall in 2005. As the title implies, the recording includes songs from their four reunion shows on 2, 3, 5, and 6 May 2005.\\"<br /><br />The CD's as well as the concert DVD's in my opinion are excellent. Yes they have aged, but like fine wines are better with age. The vocals may be a bit rusty but the musicianship is superb. Remember, this is 37 years after their farewell concert. These guys still remember how to rock, a classic three man band.<br /><br />Cream<br />Jack Bruce - vocals, bass guitar, harmonica<br />Eric Clapton - guitar, vocals<br />Ginger Baker - drums, cowbells, vocals<br /><br />I loved watching Ginger Baker, just like a giant spider, arms and legs a flurry. At times I wanted to count them, to confirm that there was only four. Ginger is one of the greatest drummers of all time. I especially enjoyed him on one of his side projects over the years, \\"The Baker Gurvitz Army\\" self titled debut. His drum solos are legendary. The \\"Toad\\" solo is  awesome.<br /><br />And the songs take on new life and vigor, with all the energy and skill of veterans who have honed their craft and know how to rock effortlessly. Clapton and Bruce make it look so easy. There are a couple songs that have suffered the test of time but all in all a 5-plus star performance. If you are a fan of Cream, I don't have to tell you that this DVD is well worth picking up.<br /><br />The concert footage and production is superb and very well presented. Great camera angles and close-ups. The choice and mix of music is classic and these guys show that they are still the masters of their craft. True professionals,legends of rock and roll.<br /><br />For previews of music and videos not available on Amazon, check out Cream's \\"Royal Albert Hall\\"(full concert) out on You Tube.
B001ER4CNY|3.0|I purchased the box set of &#34;I Dream Of Jeannie&#34;. Love the show, the concept of the packaging is cute, but not practical! For the price that Amazon offers, it's a good deal.
B0086PGCHQ|5.0|I love everything he does. Some more that others. This is a more traditional jazz sound. He can play. Always happy to listen to any collaboration and his style weaving is amazing
B0063IH60K|5.0|I really like the ease of playing this and being able to move the card just by tapping the screen. The hints are helpful when you get stuck. Easy to win this.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I love this book it leaves you on the edge of your seat. It really makes you want to read the next books, and all of her other books.
B00846REIS|5.0|A great love story of two confused people! Keeps the reader interested the whole way through! Just the right amount of passion and seriousness.
B009O5CLZY|5.0|Keeps my son entertained. He enjoys riding on the yeti's and snowmobiles and eagles. Cool graphics and characters. Great buy.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was the first I bought for my new kindle and it was amazing! The emotions-raw,real and conveying. I  not could not stop reading. I will be reading more of Ms. Hoover's books soon.
0345528581|5.0|This book is a life changer. I have been using the suggested routines for 6 weeks now. I had had many people comment on how &#34;fit&#34; I look after only 4 weeks. I am regularly sore and feel very connected to my body. The exercises are very efficient. Though he has the routine broken up my Legs, Core, Arms, I am always working multiple muscle group with each exercise. I downloaded a $2 app for my ipad to guide my workouts. It is amazing, like have my own personal trainer.<br />Best money I have ever spent on exercise &#34;equipment&#34; , memberships, etc.<br />I have gotten this as gifts for others.  I am looking forward to he soon to be release book targeted @ women.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved this book it was absolutely amazing I can't wait to read the next one. This book was one of the best books I have ever read.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This series is definitely a highly enjoyable escape from today's world.  The characters are well-written and interesting.  Definitely recommend to all
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|Great book. It's funny, and a bit predictable, if you read the other Diary of a wimpy kid books. If things are going \\"swell'' for Greg, chances are, everything will screw up.  I also LOVE reading it off the Kindle because when a new book comes out, it becomes SUPER popular, and they begin to sell out. The next thing you know, you can't find the book anywhere. With the Kindle, it never sells out, because it's not paper or ink. It electronic. Bottom line, if you like very funny books, The Third Wheel (the 7th book of Diary of a wimpy kid), is right for you.
B00AMBLDEE|3.0|This was okay but lacked the intensity and action of the trilogy with Jason Bourne. Good story but falls short of great.
B007VUCAVO|1.0|No idea how this app gets positive reviews.  Can only assume these people don't have a good understanding of their devices, or this app is waaay better on their model of phone than it is on mine. I have the HTC Droid DNA, and this app doesn't do anything accurately except tell me the current percent charge status of my battery (which I could get from the phone before I installed the app).  I went straight to the &#34;Pro&#34; (paid) version of the app based on the overwhelmingly positive reviews, did the full calibration according to instructions (over 1 hour), but the information this app provides is completely inaccurate and wholly disconnected from reality.  Other than the percent charge, there is literally not one piece of information it provides that is in any way accurate or helpful.  It even tries to project how long it will take to acheive full charge status via A/C or USB charging (which would be good information to have), and that projection is off by such a wide margin that it is laughable.  Even while the phone is actually charging, this app can't calibrate itself to provide an accurate estimate of when the charge will be complete.  If you already have this app, I would suggest you check/validate the information this app provides to see if any of it is correct.  Don't assume that it is accurate just because it shows you some numbers.  It seems like a good idea, but very, very poorly executed and really just useless.  This is the first app I have ever owned that I can say is a complete rip-off.  Thankfully it was only 2 bucks!
B00AE2J5HI|5.0|The acting was superb. I loved the storyline, the grit and the realism. I had no idea it was based on true events until the ending credits.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I gave it 4 stars because I enjoy solitaire. This game is just like every other game. I like it.
1439102724|4.0|I purchased this as a gift because I like the author and her treatment of contemporary themes.  Explores what it means to be gay in today's world.
B00112GVFO|5.0|Would I rate Sahara amongst the best films ever?  No, of course not. But everyone has a different reason for watching a particular movie and for adventure, good triumphs over evil and all-around fun I give this movie a big thumbs-up.  Music is decent, it's hard to dislike McConaughey's grin and the dynamic between Dirk and his side kick is good.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|I got started on the Reacher books after a friend told me about them and I must say I am so happy he did. I wanted to start with the first book so I ordered the Killing Floor and WOW. I could not put it down , I love the way it is written and the way it keeps you guessing with turns and twist every where. I will follow the Reacher books and am on the second one now.
0307943232|1.0|A recycled and unbelievable story that is not worth the price of the paper it is printed on. This is the last Grisham book for me.
1419705849|5.0|The continuing saga at its best.  My son who began the books at a much younger age STILL loves the sequels
B00AKEMHCA|4.0|this is an awesome game nothing wrong execpt that there's no sandbox mode. the online version had it so why not this I paid 3 bucks for it!
B004LWZWGK|5.0|Best Movie of 2012<br />Best Batman Movie of All Time<br />Action Packed Movie<br />You have to get the combo pack!
B00APUYWYA|3.0|Movie was fun but definitely not worth theater prices. More of a made for tv movie.  An adult Glee that does not quite hit it's mark.
B008L1DNGI|1.0|The title of the review says it all. If I could have rated it a negative number I would have.
B0011AQLZQ|5.0|My five-year-old says \\"I love this movie, it's the best movie I ever watched!\\"  He is so excited for watching the next movie in the series.
B0092MKFIY|5.0|From hits like It's time, Radioactive, or Demons, to the lesser but still easy to listen to tunes, this is a wonderful collection of catchy melodies with Dan Reynolds languid emotive voice.  Great alternative rock.
B000I9YLUI|5.0|This is one of my favorite books and movie adaptations. Love that you can download it from Amazon and play right away on your computer. Highly recommend.
0307744434|4.0|This is a really good book, I loved the idea of the book, but it was at times hard to follow. Even though I did have a slight problem staying on track, it was all in all a very good read!
0307888908|3.0|There was a lot of good information in this book, but I kept getting the feeling that it was written more to increase the author's status than to help the reader. It was also unnecessarily lengthy. After the first couple chapters I started skimming the book, and it was much better that way. I do recommend it, but don't bother reading the whole thing, just skim it and read the parts you want to learn more about.
0425263908|5.0|GREAT BOOK!!! Cannot wait to read the next 2 books in this series!! It is right up there with Fifty Shades in my opinion, and I promise you will love it!!
B0052AC8C6|5.0|Rango is a brilliant and refreshing story.  It's suitable for adults and kids, with an entertaining and fast-paced plot.  When I first watched it, I had no idea what it was about or what to expect, and was pleasantly surprised.

B00992CF6W|5.0|I have been waiting forever for this game to come out in the aneroid market!! Works perfect on the Kindle Fire! I recommend this app for engine who loves Minecraft!
0062124293|5.0|OMG, Ms. Moran is hilarious!! I wish this book would have been out 15 years ago, before becoming a mother of 3!! Ms. Moran is an excellent writer, and so funny!! Any woman out there, if you haven't read this book yet, you really need to!! You will not regret it!!
B009RI4FRU|2.0|The premise of this movie is interesting but the filming is so odd that it seems awkward.  I can't recommend this movie.
B007JQLNXG|5.0|My husband is the biggest PG fan & this was a gift for him.  He LOVED it.  What a great CD & fast shipping too! :)
0307720748|5.0|Richard Branson's &#34;Losing my Virginity&#34; is a delight to read. It's difficult to put down; it radiates joie de vivre, enterprise, great courage, good sense, and humor,  but also understanding and generosity. I wish him success with his remarkable groups of the Elders.
B0084AZXKK|5.0|Enjoyed the read.... a true classic that you will not want to put down and when you are finished you which that you were not.

B001XUKFAQ|4.0|Robert Downey jr was incredible in this.He is very versatile and one would not know it was him at first. it was a fun movie to watch
B00003CXDG|5.0|very good movie, great sound, I have repeated several times because I like the plot, acting and quality of its protagonist
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|Mindless fun and a great way to pass your time.  A little frustrating until you realize that successfully passing to another level means you have to earn a specified number of points...winning boards with one star won't do it!
B00004RF98|5.0|Classic film that allows new generations, as my children, appreciate the film classic and amazing actors missing and they could not know
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|The game lets you use your intuition and knowledge to crack it.  The solutions are not always apparent and you have to find ways that aren't obvious.

B00007E7K0|4.0|Exact duplicate and works just as original.  I'm sure I'll lose this one too, since I tend to set them down, but this works just as designed. I'd sure like these to be half the price of what they are . . .
B00000K19E|5.0|good recording, I really like the sound and picture quality, for fans of these films, I recommend this recording to their collections
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is a great game. If you are looking for minecraft then this is the one and only place to look other than the demo. If you turn else were then you will most likely be scamed by someother person acting like their game is minecraft and is cheeper than the real one. There is a person that goes by the name vicky and creates fonny games called mindcraft and is making a pile off of money. The people who are looking for minecraft need to get games from mojang and from nowere else.<br />I support mojang and we need to stop buying these discraceful game that are copied and stolen and twisted by a pesent named vicky, shame on you.
B00003CX8J|5.0|very good movie, great sound, I have repeated several times because I like science fiction, and his scenes are very well done
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is probably the best start off to a series I have ever read. The action was intense, the emotions were pungent, the love was real. I'm a newcomer to this author and series (obviously) and I can say without a smidgen of doubt that I am so excited to start the second book. YOU SHOULD TOTALLY READ THIS BOOK!!!
B0074JODP8|5.0|Joe's music is great. Who ever loves blus will love this. And the guiter play is something to die for.
B003WE9TU8|5.0|An unusual collection of eye witness accounts of survivors which pieced together the story of the events during the zombie apocalypse. I liked the second half of the book better as the interviews where more in-depth and gave greater light to the zombie war. Overall a great book,
B004MC8CA2|5.0|i love it . I read the bible every sunday in sunday school and worship time. If you are God's child read it every day.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Picked up right where we left off.  I couldn't put it down.  Can't wait until the next book is released.
B0012QRPU4|3.0|The 11 mins I saw was funny and looks to be a good show to watch. I think I will download and watch 1st season.
B008NMT684|5.0|My son loves this puzzle game!  He steals my kindle all the time to play the dump truck puzzles.  It is easy enough for little kids and keeps them occupied.  My son just turned 3 yrs old.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|I really enjoyed this first episode of a show that I had heard about but had never seen. It was intriguing and fascinating and I plan to watch more.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|This is a great movie!  My son just turned 3 and he LOVES it!!!  He wants to watch it over and over and I actually don't mind listening to it on repeat.  It has great music and the colors are so bright, it has quickly become a favorite at our house, even my husband likes it.
4770031246|3.0|i got this because i wanted luch ideas for bento boxes i had bought for myself and my son. this is a great book. it does have some ideas that need to be cooked prior and cooled down before placing in a bento box. but they are all good recipes. to at least try.
B006M4RN3U|5.0|I love the beat of the drums.  The vocals are great, too!  I first heard it while shopping and it was playing on the radio.  My daughter found out the artists and the name of the song.  Got home and typed in the  &#34;FUN&#34;  and ordered the CD.  Love it!!
B00000JXVK|5.0|Bruce Brown is a remarkable documentary film director and he was on top of his game when he made this. The only drawback is that this film has become dated, Thankfully motorcycling has a timelessness about it, so the dated aspect doesn't detract too much.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|Although this book was listed as a young adult selection, I decided to go with it after reading positive reviews from other not-so-young-adults (I am 36). It was so hard to put down and I finished it very quickly. I like John Green's writing style -- easy to read but also descriptive. The characters were fleshed out and I felt like I knew them and shared their triumphs and tragedies. This book is somewhat of an emotional roller coaster, and I had tears one minute, laughter the next. I would highly recommend it for anyone who has ever been a teenager and/or experienced a first love. Definitely not just for teens and young adults, IMO. I also plan to read his other book, Looking for Alaska.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|Does exactly as it claims.  Very intuitive and a joy to use.  MP3 downloads of videos are high quality.  No need to look at other apps.
B005LAJ17M|5.0|Outstanding drama. Writing is fantastic. Just when you think you have it figured out, another twist comes along!<br />Without a doubt, the BEST drama on TV. If you liked 24, you will love this show.
B0013O123Q|2.0|The camera is so shaky and flows a random pattern of movement.  It is not on the subject thats saying the dialogues...
B008YRVW0I|4.0|Love match games.  This one has the extra twist of building the aquariums.  I would like it better if the free game gave you more free game time.  Easy game for all ages.
B009H442DG|2.0|Who doesn't love Olivia newton John and John travel tea together?  Well this cd didn't knock my socks off.  Listened to it once and passed it along to a friend.  Sorry to say
1563898586|5.0|I gave this to the girlfriend for christmas and she loved it.  Perfect condition and excellent!  I would recommend it to everyone, except my eight year old niece.
B006LMMN8I|5.0|Not only do I love it but my children who range from 21 to 30 love it as well.  Bravo!
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|Not as much senseless violence as the last one.  Good acting, and a great story!  Well worth watching, I would highly rocommend.
0425263908|5.0|Weeks after and still haven't gotten over this book. The story and characters are so well developed you're 'vested in it. Can't wait for the third sequel
B009NT0I06|5.0|This is her best album, I bought the digital version when it came out and had to have the vinyl after just one listen, it is without a doubt her best songwriting although the music has moved from country/pop to almost all pop.
B00992CF6W|1.0|I have minecraft on the xbox and think its a amazing game but when I try to get the pocket version for my kindle fire a thing pops up on my screen and says there is a error while downloading and it cant be installed
B002WY65W4|4.0|The movie is great, definitely a most have, but the package is really simple, it's good for the price but don't expect anything else other that the movie inside.
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|&#34;Ted&#34; was hilarious!  Best comedy I've seen in a really, really long time.  That being said, I went in with low expectations and as a result, was very pleasantly surprised.  NOT, I repeat NOT A MOVIE FOR CHILDREN at all.  Yeah, there's a cute Teddy Bear that starts in the film, but the character is about as crude as one might imagine, coming from the input/help of Seth McFarlane.<br /><br />One thing to be cautious of - If you have an HD TV (or whatever kind of media system you are using), be sure to select the &#34;HD&#34; version of the movie.  We accidentally selected the &#34;Standard Definition&#34; version and while it was still watchable, it would have been infinitely more enjoyable in hi-definition.  It would have been worth the extra $1 to have rented the &#34;HD&#34; version.<br /><br />All-in-all, fun goofy film for adults only.  We will be purchasing this one on Blu Ray.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Very funny movie. must see makes you laugh quite a bit. Two gross parts if you get queasy from puke watch out!!!!
B000002IWH|5.0|Perfectly stylized, intensely raw- the crow soundtrack moves you almost as much as Brandon Lee's stunning and flawless performance. Not only does the movie stand the test of time, but this soundtrack will live forever in the hearts and souls of all true fans. It takes you on a ride through the darkness, and makes you feel the angst and pain of the main character. Golgotha Tenement Blues truly represents the intense thrilling feel of the movie, fast past rock n roll, with a rusty grungy feel that makes you feel you're inside the movie itself. 'Burn' has  a slower, more painful feel to it, but also represents this movie so well.  All in all, an amazing soundtrack that all generations to come should listen to.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|This book did a good job of showing the true life of someone with OCD, & PTSD who is trying to live a life as normally as she possibly can.  It also showed the characters struggles between seeking additional help & just continuing  to live as she is.  Add some romantic interest & the possible threat lurking in the subtext & this book will have your attention front to back!
B000PMLFRA|5.0|Great Star Wars movies, great format. Fabulous resolution and sound. The blueray experience is really good. We are loving them!
B00AHSINKO|3.0|Has some funny moments and is an overall entertaining movie.  Somewhat predictable, but Tommy Lee Jones and Meryl Streep play their parts well!
0060523794|5.0|Mr.Gerstner shares his personal experience of saving and transforming IBM in a unique way. For me personally, this book has been an inspirational moment and one of many reasons why I joined this great company.

B004FGMDOQ|4.0|Loved this. Was an easy to get into and had to finish fast kind of read. I will recommend to all my reader folks.
B004TN7QPG|1.0|It would be a great program if we could get it to work on all kindles we bought,<br />but it only works on the older ones.<br />I would not recommend anyone to buy it because it would be a waste of money<br />when the new kindles will not support the program.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Got it for my youngest brother (8 years old) and he LOVES star wars.  The blu-ray definition quality is stunning.  Just watching it again makes me feel like watching a whole new episode, but its just the quality of the image/video.
B005IQ39AY|5.0|This is a fun app, sometimes it goes off my kindle, then I have to restart.  I would recommend it to everyone
B004VRK3ZU|5.0|This is a great movie and I have watched it over many times when I was little. I decided to add this to my collection because I still enjoy watching it once in a while.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I enjoy sitting down everyonce and a while and playing a game. It keep your mind sharp and gives you skills to think. Thanks.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|This is a great combo if you like avengers. Comes with 4 cds of which 3 contain the movie and 1 is used to activate the digital copy. The quality of the digital quality is not that good, it looks worse than the dvd one. But there is also a code inside which can be used for some prizes online.
B003C1SPX8|5.0|I'm glad they finally put this out on DVD. Great show and the extra features rock! A must for Dire Straits fans!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Of all the books concerning death that I've read--and a strange WWII phase in middle school has left me with a plethora of tear stained memories to chose from--this one gave me that beautiful wink of hope and  an arguably satisfying end. I'd like to thank my friend Lyndie for recommending this book to me(I finally got around to it!). Your habit of choosing books with pretty covers reaped bountiful fruit this time around. I see why you so aggressively pushed this one. If you're a little weary from narratives that make you feel bad about being a person--thanks, F. Scott Fitzgerald--then you'll find this story refreshing. So thanks, John Green, you've wowed me again.
1592536913|3.0|The problem with the \\"1000 series\\" books is how the info about each piece is in the back of the book, so you have to keep flipping back and forth. Even then, there is only the barest ammount of info about each picture. The title implies there are 1000 separate and distinct items featured in the book, but to be clear: there are 1000 photographs, and some of those photos are detail shots of other featured pieces. That being said, there are some stunning pieces of artwork--I mean totally breathtaking! I'm not sure all of them are strictly steampunk, so if you aren't familiar with the genre, it might be confusing. Worth a look, but unless you are a huge steampunk fan, probably not a must-have.
B000YDAZ2Q|5.0|Great boots.  The Only problem is that you have to lace them all the way up to the top.  No quick lace tabs.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|Incredible selection of stations.  Signal is powerful.  This app is on my laptop and Kindle Fire.  Wouldn't be without it.

B009HEJXFS|3.0|If you enjoyed the first 2 issues of this movie, you might find this version more of the same. The movie holds no surpises until the end when you find out how J and K became partners and why.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|A plot that keeps you turning page after page. Much better than the first book, an actual story line. Book three should be interesting.
B003B02O0A|4.0|In my opinion, this is Grisham's best novel even though it did not originally sell. Good plot, strong characters. Can't wait to read his new visit to this Mississippi town.
B007MDB548|5.0|Excellent item, very good quality of the product, Excellent delivery. I recommend it 100%. Best present for children that love this movie.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Love being on fb and connecting with friends. I spend a lot of time on here and have no problems with this app

B004H1V5RU|5.0|We first saw the perplexus toy at the dentist about 6 months ago.  When Christmas rolled around my 8 yo son asked for the Perplexus Epic.  He loves this toy.  I would highly recommend this toy for any kid from 6 to 106!!!

B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Who doesn't love this stupid game??  Not a lot of variety, but I can't get enough.  Your money runs out and you have to come back often to advance, but its as much fun if not more than what I played at the carnival as a little tyke.
B00957T6X6|5.0|Enjoyed this series, only thing I dislike about my new Kindle is all of the adds that pop up.. Everything from Shampoo ads to Battery adds. If my kindle had not been a gift I would not have purchased one.
0345803485|5.0|I bought this for a friend and she has read it several times.  She said it is one of the bext gifts I have given her.
1423124111|5.0|I put this on my Christmas wishlist because I love some of the older WDW poster artwork and I thought it would make a great coffee table book. The book managed to exceed my expectations with both the quality of the print as well as the quantity of material from parks all over the globe. It's a great collection of art and the history behind the parks and attractions.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|Pixar and Disney have blown it out of the water again! Such a cute movie, the entire family will enjoy it.
B009GED3HS|5.0|I think this is one of the best shows to hit TV. It's funny yet serious. You can't help but laugh every episode and in return your learn a little something.
B009S33I68|5.0|Mom and her apple pie are strong motivators when men must go to war.  The real reason so many men do so many heroic things in war is that they won't let their buddies down.  They can't.  These are the men they've laughed and cried and even died with.
0792162803|5.0|This movie is for WEIRD and FUNNY people. This movie is not serious and is actually a stupid movie. BUT, it's stupid funny. It has my favorite actress in it and I just had to buy it!<br /><br />Movie Description:<br />Its about a girl who wants to get a kiss. Not just a kiss. A one form a romantic hollywood movie kiss. So in order for her to get a kiss, she thinks she has to become a &#34;Superstar.&#34; While she is trying to be one, she doesn't really do a good job, according to her classmates. While she is trying to be a &#34;Superstar,&#34; she comes across some obstacles that she must face. She is very weird in the movie. It also teaches you a lesson about bullying.<br /><br />***So if you think this movie sounds interesting. . . .  it is. But it's going to probably be one of those movies, where you just watch it once, then putt it in the DVD cabinet for the rest of your life.***
B00526ZKYS|5.0|This book's high quality deserves a high rating. The actual story is incredibly creative, having love taking on the role of a greatly feared disease. The plot is beautifully woven together, with a mixture of suspense and romance and many meaningful themes.
B0036EH3XE|5.0|I haven't had time to watch the video yet but it was shipped properly and quickly. I also saw the video in the store but it was cheaper to buy online.
B000VYX8PE|4.0|Overall a very good book. If you are just starting to read fiction like this, then this is a great place to start. However, if you are an experienced reader, all of these books are a great read and a good stress-reliever.
B0019LY5IM|5.0|Haven't had time to watch the video yet but it was shipped quickly and at a good price. I saw this video in the stores and it was more expensive.
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|its great but if you don't play 4 a week or so. all your data gets deleted:( but its great:)
B005HSG3U6|2.0|My mistake.  I thought this would fit the kindle fire hd.  It does not.  I will be returning them. Xxx xxxx
B0052GACNM|2.0|Disappointing. I gave it away to the same person I gave the Viva Duets CD to. I just couldn't get into it.
0545128285|4.0|Given as a present. The 10 yea old girl specifically asked for this book for Christmas. As of this date no report on likes or dislikes.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|The only thing I would like to see this do is allow me to play my games. They need to incorporate Flash into the Android OS so this is possible. Otherwise, it's pretty much like using Facebook on your PC.
1594744475|4.0|I love the receipes and the ideas. It wasn't as simple as i thought it would be. If you are in a rush in the morning then some of these ideas wouldn't work so well. But you do get cool ideas.
B00APUQT7I|4.0|My son and I watched this together and enjoyed it thoroughly. It maybe our favorite of all the Ice Age movies.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|fix this app. please. as others have said, it only loads the first few posts in the news feed. i have gone back to using this app on my android phone because it works just fine on it. but it sure would be a lot nicer if it would work on my much larger-screened kindle fire hd...just please fix it.
B003ZSI7R2|3.0|Lacked the drive of there live show, still a very interesting band.Hope to hear more soon yes yes yes yes
B0026772N8|3.0|I found the pace very uneven and the author seemed lost much of the time. I wanted to like the book since it was lauded by so many, but it failed to keep my attention.
B007MB5OCE|5.0|This is so much fun to read. It's such a clever story with colorful characters. It's also a really easy read so it's great for post-holiday fatigue!!
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I enjoyed every minute of reading this book.  I could not not the book down, read it in a few days.
B0079R8IYW|4.0|Fits perfectly, seems sturdy enough and good protection for my kindle. Has extra storage pockets in the front cover, too.
B0053Q9DHW|4.0|Is there a better story out there... Jane Eyre is by far my favourite book, so I was thrilled when this came out. This version is good, but there is a better version of Jane Eyre out there. The 2006 BBC (Masterpiece Theatre in America) version is by far the best version of Jane Eyre out there. This movie is well worth the watch though, it is a ore condensed version of the book Jane Eyre.
B001S86J0I|5.0|Galaxy Quest is Entertaining and so funny for the whole family! We have watched this movie over and over and always laugh.
B0013BCWEW|5.0|I won't go into the details of this movie except to say that it's a five star film and light years better than Fincher's tedious, overrated The Social Network. This review is specifically for the UK import.<br /><br />In case you're like me and you missed your chance of adding Zodiac to your blu-ray collection, this is a cheaper way to go. First and foremost, this blu-ray is Region Free and will play on all Region 1 players. All of the special features that were on the 2-disc special edition are here including the feature length documentaries \\"This Is the Zodiac Speaking\\" and \\"His Name Was Arthur Lee Allan\\",  Finch's commentary, and the theatrical trailer. The picture is a perfect 1080p and is anamorphic. The audio is Dolby Digital 5.1.  As an added bonus, not only is cover all in English (and not a two part English/ foreign language one) you get your choice of covers as this is a flipper; one side is the domestic Director's Cut release artwork, the other is the UK's.<br /><br />I've seen the US Director's Cut blu-ray prices running as high as $69 and up. So unless you think that price is cushion change, the Warner Brothers UK import is the way to go. Get it now before even these disappear into the realm of OOP titles.
B002PEP4SC|4.0|I can hear the actors from the show as I read the pages. If you enjoy the show Castle, then you will enjoy the book. It is suspenseful and sexy all at the same time.
B008HK3XKO|3.0|I had previous case that had a place to put your hand to hold the case with while reading.  I miss this with the Marware Vibe
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I got this game for my Kindle Fire HD 8.9, works great on it.<br /><br />The game has levels organized by grid size, e.g. 5x5, 6x6, etc. Each grid has pairs of colored dots placed on it, with many blank squares. Your goal is to connect the dots of the same color. You can't cross other colored lines, and every square in the grid must have a line through it when you're done.<br /><br />Sounds complicated, doesn't it? It's not. The smallest puzzles can be done in a few seconds, the larger ones in a minute or less. There are a couple dozen of each puzzle size to work through. As you do them, you learn strategies that will help you solve the next level.<br /><br />The game is simple and well done. The touch controls work great, the interface is intuitive, and the organization of levels keeps you coming back for more.<br /><br />A perfect example of a straight-forward, enjoyable game! I've played it maybe an hour total in one- and two- minute chunks, and look forward to a few more hours of enjoyment.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was better than I thought it would be and not what I expected but in a good way I like it when you have characters you can relate to it makes it feel more real and you can feel the emotions better a must read for teens and adults
B009E3EY38|5.0|I was one of THOSE kids that grew up with Led Zeppelin.  As in: 13 years old when my late great friend Ron picked up the first LP.  Herbed first, we listened to it seven times.  Ron's dad had bugged out on the family but he left behind his Yardbirds albums, so we thought we knew what to expect the first time the needle was dropped on Good Times, Bad Times.  We were dead wrong.  Here we had a salute to the blues strapped to this new sound that had a way of magnifying the power of rock.  Led Zeppelin was the blood that flowed through our veins. I remember where I was and what I was doing when each album was released.<br /><br />So what does all that have to do with Celebration Day?  As many of you know, and the rest of you can no doubt imagine, the passing of John Bonham was like a kick to the gut and a knife to the heart.  I didn't think the band could survive John's loss.  He was the foot on the gas pedal and when the motor roared, the band synced as Robert wailed.  I personally couldn't see anyone else on the throne, ever.  Then I heard recordings of young Jason.  He was good, but I wondered how he'd hold up under a full set of Led Zeppelin.  Now that he's played a while, we have the answer.  The Youtubes didn't tell the story of how awesome of a show this was.  It's not perfect but the tiny blemishes do nothing to taint the sheer love that pours out of your TV and audio system.  Love of this body of music. This all-to-brief incarnation of Led Zeppelin bridged a huge gap of time and managed to do so in an incredibly respectful way, even as they kicked these tunes back to life.  Robert's singing is just fantastic and Jason's drumming is stellar.  His father is smiling.  I've never seen Jimmy so happy.  And John Paul Jones is seemingly ageless yet so in the pocket.  Did I say that Jason kicked it, hard?<br /><br />I could work my way through the whole set list song by song but that's counter to the way you will eventually will watch and listen to it.  This is a fantastic live document - something that's really difficult to do even with all of the tech bells and whistles - because the players still have to play awesomely.  You can overdub all you want - and there are a few in here - but nobody needs to tell you that you are listening to a kickaz live show.  So well done on every level.  Thank you, Led Zeppelin!<br /><br />Now that Christmas is over (this was my #1 gift!) I'm going to take the whole box set up to the studio and listen to it on my best monitors.  I hear some upper mid and high resonance on my TV system and can't wait to hear this on great speakers.stic live document - something that's really difficult to do even with all of the tech bells and whistles - because the players still have to play awesomely.

B005KDWUFA|5.0|If you enjoy &#34;Popera,&#34; the harmonizing blend of voices within this quartet will touch you in a profound way.  The arrangements of the music scores are interesting, and each track keeps you wanting more. I've been to their live concerts, and find myself totally engulfed in their vocal delivery!

B00AS1Q93S|4.0|During a recent coast-to-coast flight, I read my first book by Lee Child (\\"Jack Reacher: One Shot\\") and was pleasantly surprised (my reading is usually non-fiction these days). Of course I smiled when I realized that Tom Cruise would be playing a 6'5\\" former military investigator, but he plays TALL! As is always the case, two characters were melded into one, two characters disappeared altogether and I was surprised by the dump trucks, but the movie is (almost) as diverting as the book.<br /><br />In this PG-13 action-filled thriller, a sniper kills five people and escapes. Based on forensic evidence at the scene, police track down the shooter, arrest him and obtain a signed confession in record time. Problem is, he says \\"Get Jack Reacher\\" right after he signs his confession. No one has heard of the guy.<br /><br />Let's take a look at this cast:<br />  * Tom Cruise (\\"Mission Impossible\\") is our eponymous anti-hero, a loner, very smart, a man who is arrested only when he wants to be; but he's beginning to think this case looks a little too perfect.<br />  * Rosamund Pike (\\"The Big Year\\") is a newly graduated attorney who has taken a hopeless case that appears to be open and shut. She just wants to keep him off Death Row.<br />  * Richard Jenkins (\\"Liberal Arts\\") is the District Attorney whose daughter has taken this case over his objections; he intends to wrap it up right away.<br />  * David Oyelowo (\\"The Help\\") is the Police Commissioner who is only too happy to close a case this quickly...and with incontrovertible evidence. (His name is pronounced \\"O-Yellow.\\")<br />  * Alexia Fast (\\"Blackbird\\") is the sweetie sent to seduce our skeptical hero.<br />  * Joseph Sikora (\\"Safe\\") is the trained military sniper accused of shooting five random victims.<br />  * Lee Childs (Author) is the Desk Sergeant; a sharp-eyed JayFlix person spotted him making his debut cameo appearance.<br /><br />The tag line is \\"Six shots. Five dead.\\" So expect wit, fisticuffs, cold-blooded brutality, vehicular mayhem and lots of gunfire but no blowie uppie stuff or sweaty bodies. In other words, this is a movie made for a target audience who wants action and entertainment. And that's what we get! Amazon will notify me when it's available on DVD.
B004ZRV3AU|1.0|I bought this hoping that I could make homemade Christmas gifts. After seeing videos of people doing it online I thought that I would try it out. When I first got it I tested it on a few bottles and the edges were jagged and not clean breaks. So I continued trying it on different bottles. After about 10 cuts and breaks. The bottles were becoming cleaner.  But still would require a lot of work to get them to be able to use as drinking glass gifts. I would estimate at least 30 min for each bottle to make the edge perfectly smooth. So if your planning on doing 10-15 bottles thats a lot of time, and in most cases not worth it.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|\\"Do You Hear the People Sing?\\" Yes, we do! And the Oscar buzz has become a roar, with American Anne Hathaway's name on the tip of everyone's tongue! British director Tom Hooper (\\"The King's Speech\\") takes a legendary story and brings the (stage) musical version to the screen for the first time. He has a massive cast of talented performers and neither time nor space allow me to dwell on more than a few. Let me warn you however: if you don't like musicals, there are only one or two words actually spoken, everything else is sung.<br /><br />The battles in this PG-13 story are no more than minor skirmishes in the all-over scheme of the French Revolution, but the fatalities are just as dead, nonetheless.<br /><br />A couple of doughty actors from Down Under head this cast:<br />  * Hugh Jackman (\\"Real Steel\\") is Jean Valjean, the fellow who stole a loaf of bread for his starving little sister and as a result, spent many years behind bars. (Victor Hugo, like his contemporary Charles Dickens, born 10 years later, was a social reformer.) Mr. Jackman has been embraced by the Broadway crowd and is an established musical star. When he rescues little Cosette from the rapacious couple who have been her caretakers, he sings \\"Suddenly,\\" the only original song written for this movie.<br />  * Russell Crowe (\\"A Beautiful Mind\\") is Javert, the steadfast policeman determined to uphold the law after Valjean breaks parole. Until recently Mr. Crowe had his own musical group, \\"30 Odd Foot of Grunts\\" with which he performed when not acting or living on his cattle station in the Outback. Usually Javert is played by a powerful baritone and although Crowe gives it his all, this just isn't his type of music.<br />  * Anne Hathaway (\\"The Dark Knight Rises\\") is Fantine, the desperate woman who sells her hair to wig-makers in order to feed her daughter Cosette. We've never known Ms. Hathaway to sing professionally before, but she doesn't embarrass herself; \\"I Dreamed a Dream\\" is filmed \\"live\\" andis heartfelt and personal.<br />  * Samantha Barks (\\"Les Misérables in Concert: the 25th Anniversary\\") is the adult version of Éponine, the heartbreakingly loyal young woman who loves the rebel Marius. It is immediately obvious that Barks is a stage-trained musical performer however her death-scene \\"A Little Fall of Rain\\" is poignant but almost whispered.<br />  * Amanda Seyfreid (\\"Gone\\") is the young adult Cosette, taken under Jean Valjean's powerful wing with no hint remaining of her mother's sacrifice. Seyfreid was formerly in \\"Mamma Mia!\\" Enough said about her.<br />  * Eddie Redmayne (\\"My Week With Marilyn\\") is the rebel Marius, who is head-over-heels in love with Cosette. Redmayne's work has been (mostly) with BBC-type miniseries (\\"The Pillars of the Earth\\" and \\"Tess of the D'Urbervilles\\") but no musicals. He sings \\"Red and Black,\\" remember that one?<br />  * Colm Wilkinson (\\"Evita\\" on stage) is the priest who saves Valjean when he steals the silver at the beginning, and he is there to usher him into Heaven at the end. I loved this perfect touch, as he was the ultimate Jean Valjean on stage. I got the 25th Anniversary Concert DVD from Amazon, and he is thrilling! I'm glad they asked him to appear here.<br /><br />This story covers a generation and has so many layers you may be tempted to see it again just to master the wonderful plot. Unless, of course, you read Victor Hugo's book, first published in 1862. I know I did...about a century later...smile...<br /><br />I'm sorry the production design people chose to ramp up the disgusting bits and the fright wigs. There really is no need for this over-the-top assault, the story can stand on its own without sensationalism. Tsk, tsk....

B008220C38|4.0|It's time to revisit Leo Tolstoy's classic tragedy once more. We are in the late nineteenth century Russian high society, but this time Tom Stoppard (\\"Shakespeare in Love\\") did the script and his theatrical roots are evident from the first moment, as we watch a curtain rise to reveal a stage. From then on, we move from theater to house to theater to street, etc., etc... It is a bit disorienting at the beginning, but once we adjust our expectations, it works very, very well. The actors' movements are sometimes balletic, sometimes comedic and sometimes simply theatrical, but director Joe Wright (\\"Atonement\\") never loses control.<br /><br />We see:<br />  * Keira Knightley (\\"Pride and Prejudice\\" 2005) is Princess Anna, sweet and unspoiled...but untested. She loves her son and never questions her wealth or doubts her position in society.<br />  * Jude Law (\\"Sherlock Holmes\\") is Prince Karenin, Anna's husband, a cool and distant man who has absolute trust in his wife.<br />  * Aaron Taylor-Johnson (\\"Nowhere Boy\\") is Count Vronsky, the pretty nobleman who spots Anna and is determined to win her.<br />  * Kelly Macdonald (\\"Gosford Park\\") is Dolly, Anna's sister-in-law. She is such an open, loving woman, our hearts go out to her whenever she is on screen.<br />  * Matthew Macfadyen (\\"Death at a Funeral\\" 2007) is Oblonsky, Anna's brother. He provides the comic relief. It's a marvelous trick the way his minions change his jackets; we see it a number of times and it never fails to amuse.<br />  * Alicia Vikander (\\"A Royal Affair\\") is Kitty, the darling young woman who first falls for Count Vronsky.<br />  * David Wilmot (\\"The Guard\\") is Nikolai, Oblonsky's love-struck brother who adores Kitty from afar. Tolstoy uses this farmer to examine the pre-Bolshevek Revolutionary relationship between the peasants and the nobles.<br /><br />This is a lush production with gorgeous costumes, amazing hair styles and a peek at the privileges enjoyed by the aristocracy. The Russians emulatedthe French, so the children were taught French, while the clothing and furniture echoed those of Paris.<br /><br />This R-rated film runs over two hours and is filled with endless close-ups that examine Knightley's face, hands, hair, eyes, lips, etc. I saw more than I needed during the love scenes: I still think some things are best left to our imagination (saliva anyone?). I will be notified by Amazon when this is available on DVD.

B00AIBZJLG|4.0|Talk about Systems Overload. And in 3D! Maybe you should look into a 3D DVD player from Amazon, although it has been brought to my attention that the only 3D players are Blu-Ray, which will play standard DVDs, but I doubt if they play 3D DVDs.<br /><br />This G-rated fantasy can save you a fortune in tickets because it has excerpts from five or six spectacular Las Vegas shows, and you know how much THEY cost! Among them we see selections that feature Beatles music, Elvis music, a water ballet, and some extremely athletic work that looks like it's drawn from a Chinese opera (or at least like the one I saw at the opera house here in Seattle).<br /><br />This show features a flimsy plot built around a sweet attraction between a lovely young French-looking woman (Erica Linz) and a strapping young fellow (Igor Zaripov) who looks Russian.<br /><br />You can expect:<br />  * Astonishing aerial work (I expected applause like Seattle's Teatro Zinzanni);<br />  * Cleverly choreographed synchronized swimming (a salute to Esther Williams);<br />  * An engaging little tricycle that leads our heroine from place to place;<br />  * Rubber-boned gymnasts (you have to see them to believe them);<br />  * Athletic martial arts (Jackie Chan trained in Chinese opera as a child);<br />  * Gigantic crustaceans and centipedes in a menacing dance;<br />  * A Spiderman-themed bit on trampolines;<br />  * Mind-boggling special effects with flowing curtains and streaming sand;<br />  * A lovely aerial pas de deux for the finale.<br /><br />This is a visual feast with unbelievable athletes in outrageous costumes showing us their amazing stuff. Not much plot, but we don't go to Cirque du Soleil for plots! We go to be dazzled and we are! This one is almost worth the extra for the 3D.<br /><br />It's comforting to see all the safety lines on the amazing rigging for these shows. This would mean full employment for every theatrical rigger in Las Vegas. Many of you watch the spectacle; I watch the logistics. Wow!
B009CPJHY4|5.0|The movie isFresh, funny, thoughtful, we loved it! I bought it for my husband for Christmas, and he loved it,

B007FJFDXS|4.0|Recently the original [[ASIN:B007F1ZNKY EDGE]] was purchased in the month of October and reviewed by me and gave it 4 stars. [[ASIN:B007FJFDXS EDGE Extended]] also is an excellent game worthy of 4 stars. I must thank Amazon and the developer Mobigames for making this available as free app of the day. But even at $2.99 I think this game is a worthy download if you love 3d puzzles involving cubes and perspective graphics and physics based games.<br /><br />This game is intriguing indeed as pointed out by reviewers here on Amazon for the original [[ASIN:B007F1ZNKY EDGE]] The same holds true for the EDGE Extended. The game does work very well with Kindle fire and Galaxy tab 10.1 - It is refreshingly different and the graphics are very nice. It is all sparkly and futuristic sounds and the 3 dimensional game environment makes this game super challenging yet quite fun to play. The extended version comes with 3D graphics engine, 48 original levels, 23 unique tunes and new game-play design which is similar to the original edge game.<br /><br />The game can be played in two modes, You can calibrate your tilt sensor and make it move by tilting your device or you can use finger touch to move the cube to the required destination. The reason it loses one star is some erratic movements (or it is by design) when used in tilt mode. I prefer that you use your fingers to move the cube.<br /><br />Oh! it does say about telekinesis (telekinetic) method of moving the cube but I have not mastered it yet :-) I need to exercise my brains first and concentrate to get those energy flowing in the right direction in moving the cube on my Kindle fire! when the tilt controls fails to respond accurately!<br /><br />No glaring permission issues seen and no questionable modules in the apk. A good game nevertheless! It's a keeper and a very nice FAOTD - Have fun!

B00742GBDM|2.0|The movie was mostly entertaining. They made a big deal out of Sir Thomas owning slaves but never took it anywhere or resolved it. They also had Fanny do something pretty major that was completely out of character. They changed a lot to make it more interesting but that one thing made it clear they missed the whole point of the character and the story.

B009CVAUIU|5.0|It's difficult to find words to describe this incomprehensible story. The North Korean setting means we have little information to reference. The protagonist, Jun Do, lives a life unimaginable. The entire nation lives a fiction and its leaders seem as intent on proving that America is a land of fools who live only to antagonize them and their way of life, as they are on perpetuating this fiction. It is a story at once horrifying and humorous.

B007XNAOS0|1.0|I like bands that experiment with sound/style but keep true to their overall vision (take Kylesa's last album) but this is just sad. It appears these Savannah sludge/doom kings have been dethroned. Maybe they'll realize their mistake or they will just keep putting out drivel. I can't say that I'll be paying much attention to this band any longer. At least JB's art is still awesome.

B007PF7MGS|5.0|I think this is the best book about diet and I am grateful to the author. I am so happy to eat my pasta ,rice and potatoes without any complicated story that ruins my economy. I eat to much meat and this book suggests a plantbased lifestyle so I have began to eat vegetarian to resolve my overweight problem. It really works for me that have a sedentary work and life, I was always concerned of eating healthy but there was to much animal fat in my diet. My huge belly gave me a sad feeling of being a middleaged unhealthy woman and I was so unhappy with my body. Now since I started to eat vegeterian after I got sick with cramps in the stomach I feel very well and happy it is not difficult.When you are hungry you can eat resistant starch and you will not get fat writes the author and he writes and explains all about the resistant starches nothing strange and expensive. I have lost weight, this works for me and my lifestyle and I think this is the true solution for the health and wellbeing. Woman 48 year Scandinavia.
B005LAIHXQ|2.0|A film that will either make you love it, hate it, or leave you puzzled. I think it might require repeated viewing over time to properly appreciate it, but my initial thoughts were somewhat disappointed. A fine cast and a good director ended up making a film that feels hollow at times. Unanswered questions abound throughout, and some of the characters work better than others- while I could care less about Logan Marshall-Green's Charlie, for example, Fassbender's android David is compelling. Visually it's interesting... just at first viewing, it does have an emptiness to it.
B00571F26Y|1.0|For people with celiak disease I think this book is ok. The author writes that all grains are harmful even all whole grains in the world. I have not celiak disease but I am overweight. I did not eat any grains for about 2 weeks after I read this book. I used to eat healthy I thought , no sugar, only whole grains but much meat and low fat diary. But I think this is only a good book for people who have allergies to gluten. I red another book about carbs written by another doctor, and I don`t think it`s healthy to cut all whole grains out of your diet. I felt bad and irritated when I stopped with grains and I think It is a very strange idea to not eat grains at all. I live in europe so I don´t know about the wheat quality in the US. The author only say that the wheat is not the quality of the original wheat and therefor you get fat if you eat wheat. But I call it the diary belly and together with sugar and fine carbs and diary fat, that is the problem, not only wheat. I am not a fan of the paleo diet and this is a book that say man is not made for a diet with grains even whole grains. I dont´ understand the doctors that say we shall substitute a healthy whole grain meal with cheese when you are hungry. I tried but for me it doesn´t work and I didn´t feel well.The book is only helpful for people with allergies to wheat. If you want to loose belly fat eat resistant starch, the book doesn´t talk about that but I found another book on amazon that helped me, also written by a doctor that suggested vegetarian diet with healthy carbs whole grains (resistant starch) and I have lost weight I feel very well and the the belly is smaller. Better to substitute fat cheese with whole grains is my suggestion and if you follow these paleo high fat diet you will be sick. Try the vegetarian style you can make a break sometime, and eat healthy carbs. It will help you if you are very overwight. I was so overwight and I have a sedentary work so to satisfy my hunger I eat healthy carbsand in one month lost 6 kilograms. I feel well and happy and good carbs make you feel happy and not fat. I don´t understand all these &#34;paleo&#34; doctors, there are other doctors that writes about other solutions, vegetarian and resistant starch that will work for you and give back your health. If you arent´t allergic to wheat this book is missleading. Woman 48 years old from Sweden.
1449410243|5.0|Very funny collection of cartoons and observations about the behaviour of cats. Hits a bit too close to home, at times, but in the best of ways. Highly recommended to anyone with a sense of humour... even if (and perhaps especially if) you dislike cats.
B0079R8KXG|5.0|Good workmanship, attractive and useful.  This case keeps the Kindle Fire cushioned from shocks, prevents scratching or marring and is convenient to use.
B00004RFFS|4.0|Neil Jordan's adaptation of the Anne Rice novel works fairly well. It follows a melancholy vampire (Pitt) telling his story to a reporter in the present day, recounting the tale of the vampire who made him, the girl he had a hand in turning to a vampire, and the others he has met in his travels. Pitt is sympathetic in the lead, with Kirsten Dunst holding her own as the vampire in an eternal girl's body. Antonio Banderas and Stephen Rea do very different turns as vampires. Despite getting the top billing, Tom Cruise is a supporting player as Lestat, and unfortunately is the only weak part of the cast, as usual playing himself. The man is incapable of disappearing into a character.

B008673ZAQ|5.0|This book is the second of the trilogy.  I really didn't want to put it down and resented when I had too.  As mentioned in my review of the first book, Bared to You, I do NOT think this trilogy should have been released until all three books were written because it causes the reader stress when not able to read the story line to fruition.  I would highly recommend this trilogy.  It does however start out very similar to Fifty Shades of Grey, but then it veers into a direction of its own.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Suzanne Collins has made a book that is just the right amount of comedy  tragedy  romance and fear. I couldn't put it down I have read the book twice now and still love it and can read it again. KEEP ON COME IN SUZANNE!!!!!!!
B00846REIS|5.0|Once you get past the graphic sexual eroticism the story line is really a good one.  I don't find the sexual content offensive, sometimes it's necessary in books of this nature.  This book starts as a trilogy. followed by Reflected in You, which I also thoroughly enjoyed.  My only complaint is that the third book in this trilogy will not be released until May of 2013.  This really leaves the reader hanging.  I believe the trilogy should NOT have been released until all three books were available, such as in Fifty Shades of Grey.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book gives hope and provides understanding to the world of cancer and the effects that it has on those that it inhabits. I have never been so upset that a book has ended and I wish more deeply than anyone could imagine that I could take hazel and agustus with me now that the book is over. I am left with the awful feeling that I will never find anything near as satisfying as this book was to me.

0321714113|4.0|Although I've been programming in C++ for many years, this book was needed to acclimate me to the new C++11 standards and the new 'modern style' of C++ programming. It's quite a different C++ than it used to be, so even though you'll find yourself skimming through this if you've already mastered C++, you will find plenty of new things inside the book that will help understand new features and how they relate to traditional programming.  There's a few things left out - static_assert and the new C99/C11 features added, and no coverage of multithreading, but this book will help move you over to the new C++ coding style.  To complete the experience, definitely get The C++ Standard Library (2nd Edition) and if multithreading is your thing, then C++ Conccurency in Action is a must have too.

0385536828|3.0|\\"For I rejoiced greatly when brethren came and testified of the truth that is in you, just as you walk in the truth.\\" -- 3 John 1:3 (NKJV)<br /><br />Novelists need to tell us a lesson through portraying a perception of how life can work. As readers, part of our job is to suspend disbelief so that the story can stir our minds and emotions to consider the experience the novelist has prepared for us.<br /><br />When it works well, it's wonderful. When the characters or plot veer too far from what we know to be true, we know we are just reading a story rather than living inside of it. We may admire the way the plot and wordings are arranged, but it doesn't move us. For me, Sweet Tooth had the fatal flaw that its main character, Serena Frome, doesn't ring true. Two of the other characters seemed even more false to me.<br /><br />Then, I got to the end. Boy, was that a bummer! I can't comment further without potentially spoiling someone's enjoyment of the book. So I won't. I don't like cute for the sake of showing that a writer can think of a cute ending, and this ending felt like one of those to me.<br /><br />I like spy stories as much as anyone. I also love the kinds of ethical issues that naturally arise in the context of intended deceit. If this weren't ultimately a spy story, I would have rated it lower than I did ... despite its flossy writing (in places). Focusing on the writing is a lot like praising the paint job on a car that's broken down and can't be repaired.<br /><br />Unless you feel compelled to read everything that Mr. McEwan writes, you can skip this one and not miss much.
B004ZZS4CC|4.0|Unimaginable what this girl and her family went through for so long.  Truly amazing that she is where she is today...definitely inspiring!!!
0316069434|4.0|\\"They even sacrificed their sons<br />And their daughters to demons,\\" -- Psalm 106:37 (NKJV)<br /><br />To me one of the rewards of the last few books in this series is Michael Connelly's taking on the challenge of making Harry Bosch a single parent with a demanding job. While Connelly makes the plot a little easier on Harry than real life would be, we learn a lot more about our Harry as we see how he attempts to do justice on a cold case while being a caring dad.<br /><br />The early part of this story's investigation is brilliantly put together. It's classic Bosch and Connelly. I felt, however, that in connecting that superb plotting and writing to the actual motives and criminals the story took too many easy ways out. I expected something more imaginative and credible for these parts of the story. As a result, I was a little disappointed. It's not a reason to avoid the book, but it's rather more of a let down after having been carried along at a high level.<br /><br />The conflict between Harry and the latest pencil pusher running the Open-Unsolved Unit was well done and entertaining.<br /><br />The book's climax was very well plotted and imaginatively written. I found that it took away some of the sting of not having the murder motive and plot development be more credible.<br /><br />Close to a vintage Bosch, but no cigar. But it's well worth your time.
B00AFWEPVI|2.0|I am trying to get this Kindle Fire HD 8.9 set up for my wife! We returned another tablet to get the rear facing camera and paid MORE! I asked the salesman if we can open it up and take pictures right away and he said yes (no fault of this product) but we did not know we had to buy a camera App to use the damn camera!!! BAD AMAZON!!!<br />  I bought this App without reading the reviews. I am new to this tablet stuff! My bad. There is no function for the rear facing camera so you can only take pictures from the front camera. Also after taking a very ugly but good quality picture of my Neanderthal self trying to figure out this new technology I had to exit out of the App and go to photos to delete it. A simple delete function would be nice for those bad pics. I also had to download the user guide which should have come with the App!
0316044695|5.0|This is one of my favorite books of all time. It's an easy read, very descriptive, and simply fascinating. Every American should know about what happened to these men, and why it happened. This first hand survival story is excellent.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|Captivating and couldn't put it down. I read the whole thing in 5 hours. It makes you realize what's really important.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I received a Matri Touchscreen Internet Tablet for Christmas and hoped to use it for reading ebooks I purchased from Amazon.  The download went smoothly and the other ebooks I own and have read on my laptop and iphone synchronized perfectly with the tablet.  The Kindle app works seamlessly with all my electronics and I can skip from one device to another without missing my place in any of my books.  I opened the tablet, signed on to my wireless internet connection, signed on to Amazon, went to the Kindle Store, downloaded the app and was reading my books in less than five minutes.
B0063IH60K|3.0|I mildly am entertained by this application.  It is not flashy but, that is not a problem.  It is a fun and entertaining way to make use of spare time.
B009X010RU|4.0|Very light weight.  Stand could fit more securely into slot but does hold well enough for my needs.  Strap holds cover securely.

B003G4W49C|5.0|Fabulous. Just fabulous. So painful to read yet miraculously uplifting. Was engrossed from the very beginning. Would highly recommend to anyone who appreciates a fantastically articulated story of resilience and the beauty of the true human condition.
B000VDDDVO|5.0|I love this movie, it is a classic for our family and it was a great deal on amazon. I love the fact that it has 2 movies, one in black and white and one in color. Very nice
B0076DELIG|2.0|Unlike his other books, this one had too much detail and was not interesting.  I liked some of the other Harry Bosch novels, but not this one.
B008Z9YGEE|3.0|Having read the trilogy (at the urging of a coworker) I knew this wasn't &#34;great literature&#34; going in. However, I thought the movie did a pretty good job interpreting the story line. The premise is pretty disturbing (spoiler alert): Teens and pre-teens forced to kill one another in order for their families to survive, while the citizens of the &#34;Capital&#34; enjoy an extravagant life style. While analogies are made by the book's author about children surviving war and brutality, I feel it was never made clear in either the books or the movie. It's a tough subject matter, especially the slaughter of the innocents at the beginning of the games themselves, and then with Rue, the young girl that reminds Katniss of her sister Primrose. I'm not sure I would take a pre-teen to see this movie. Overall acting quality was good: I thought young actress Jennifer Lawrence's portrayal of Katniss never sank into maudlin or simple sympathy-seeking. She and the other teens (possibly early 20-somethings) did a bang-up job. I can't quite say the same for some of the other stereotypical casting choices: how many times are we going to see Donald Sutherland as the moustache-twirling villain or Woody Harrelson as a stoned-out (alcohol besotted in this case) loser? Really? Overall, even knowing the story line, I still found myself moved during the film... so I guess it was a success... although a slightly hollow one. Can't quite put my finger on what the books and the movie are missing. Is it a teen story or is it hard-boiled science fiction/fantasy? Neither in my opinion.
B00866JL96|4.0|It was a lovely romantic movie. You root for Zac the whole time but it doesn't quite seem like they picked the right girl for the movie so its not quite believable. Zac looks really good and its a nice love story.
B004SUDPXW|5.0|This is one of my boyfriend's favorite series on tv right now.  He was thrilled about getting it as a gift.  He hasn't finished watching the entire season yet, but from what he has watched so far...he thinks it is a great season.
B003Y5H5HO|5.0|This was an increadible movie. Really heavy, not something you would want to watch with your family. The rape scene is extremely intense, I had to close my eyes because I couldn't handle it, but the acting is amazing and there is so much suspense the entire time.
B005IQZB14|4.0|I couldn't read it from my husband's iPad. I tried also in mine, and it kept taking me to read it online. I had to returned it.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I am a complete freak for this game. A friend told me about it and after him persisting I looked it up. Now I cant stop I got it originally on appstore then android and now amazon.What I am tryingto say is I have this for tablet ipod touch and mobile phone.
B00A77II0U|5.0|The game is amazingly addictive. It's got really scary parts like a movie would have. I started it on normal not the hardest one anyway and it is Hella fun. U have to find hidden objects that make no since for use in th  game but it's fun to try an find them in one screen shot. Looking for a butterfly a key (useable) lace, cup, hat, and out of 14 objects u have to find 2 or 3 are actually use able. If played it about 1 he now and for me to like a using my kindle fire HD and to give it a rating is saying something cause I almost never buy Or even try to find apps.let alone rate one. Get the game. It takes time and a good eye to scan the environment for items u need. Great scary way to pass a little board um.

0553801473|2.0|Well, I don't write many reviews, but since I've dedicated weeks of reading time to this series, I figured I'd let you all know where this newest book has taken us. Let me just put it this way, if you enjoy reading about surcoats, and descriptions of scenery, then this book is for you. This book and the one before it (a feast of crows) have just about bored me to death. I find myself skimming through chapters to find the juicy stuff on a regular basis. It's like the author knows that he can get away with writing 1000 page books with half of it filled with useless wordage, so why not? The story has drawn thin, and I can only hope that the next book or two give us adventure and surprise because that's what makes me happy with a book at the end of the day. Reading about feasts and how long is takes for someone to wipe their a** is old news and not something I wish to continue to read about.
B004EFYZ1C|5.0|This is a great app. Very interesting and amazing to look at. I have only had it a few days but am enjoying it so far.
B000F9RB8A|5.0|This movie is fun and hilarious. It's a funny martial arts movie. Be advised that you will have to select (English) Dubbing for the language, as it is a foreign movie. This movie has a great storyline and plot.  The wardrobe, make up, and sets are very good for a movie of this type. The actors are great! This is a classic movie to own, and it's great entertainment. Movies like this are highly unique and rare... it's a must have and own. The sound quality is very good, with hard hitting fight sequences, and great CGI effects. Buy it on Blue Ray. Thanks.
B0054X3FQO|3.0|Its an uplifting book and a good read when you are feeling a little down. At first I didn't care for it's repetitiveness or advice from a gorgeous wealthy woman who obviously has it made. I gave it another chance and I liked it.

B00AMBLXP8|4.0|Very enjoyable, great animation and movement of Ted. Would recommend for adults. All the actors did a good job. A++++
B000SEGMAU|4.0|I know everyone seems to love Tuesdays with Morrie. I liked it.<br /><br />I too have spent time with people who are dying; people once vibrant and hopeful, busy living and loving and have found much wisdom in their experiences and end of life perceptions and perspectives. Morrie's thought's, while simple, profound and wise have been echoed by others. The best lesson I took from this story was one of respect. The lack of respect our society give those who have journeyed through this life and almost reached the end. The wisdom that experience has gifted them is not necessarily as valued as it could, as it should be.
B00633W614|5.0|Can't wait for the third book.  Enjoyed the easy way the story flowed and you got to know each character
0979019710|5.0|This book is definitely a lifesaver, it puts into perspective your life and what you need to do to get from where you are to where you need and want to be. I could not put it down, there were so many eye opening statements and quotes that you just want to Thank Hal Elrod for bringing this book to your attention. The book with the journal is accountability at its finest. Reading this book had led to me making major changes already and I just received my book last Monday. It's a MUST READ!<br />Vanessa,  PA
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie. I have read all of the books in the series and was excited to see it put on the big screen. Overall I enjoyed the movie even though there were some differences from the book its was still pretty good. I did feel the story was a bit rushed, but I don't think it would be as noticeable to someone who didn't read the story prior to seeing the movie.<br /><br />This movie is definitely worth seeing!

B004LWZWGA|5.0|The following review started out as a gentle and respectful reply to another reviewer, so it may not seem as cohesive as other reviews, but I'm now posting it for two reasons: 1) I'm really tired of all the \\"too long\\" comments, because I see that response as an indication of the general loss of decent attention spans that now exists in the citizens of our troubled nation (USA, but maybe other nations too?), and 2) there seem to be a lot of shots taken at Chris Nolan-just for being Nolan, and since--IMHO--TDKR is the most \\"Nolan-ese\\" of the series, I suppose people who don't like Nolan will find more to dislike than those who like him.  And, it may also be true that points 1 and 2 above are connected.  On the other, I really like long films, and I really like Chris Nolan's film-making, so I'll admit that my bias in those two areas shows up clearly.  Oh well.<br /><br />But, to the \\"review\\":  I'm not a Batman fanatic, from the comix side, but I do like Chris Nolan, esp Memento & Inception, and I guess this film \\"felt\\" more like a Chris Nolan film than the first two. I'll also concede that I am one of those crazy people who actually likes *really* long films! (Ben-Hur and Lawrence of Arabia are two of my favorites.) Having said that, I'll note that I thought TDKR was amazing, and--in some ways--the best of the three. I had not read many reviews of this one until I watched it, so the way the plot unfolded was mostly new to me, and I have to say that I genuinely liked the way Nolan paced that unfolding, especially as Bane was set-up as virtually unbeatable, perhaps even by Batman at his peak.<br /><br />I've heard Bane described as \\"jolly,\\" or perhaps just too flippant, but I think his attitude is simply a supreme confidence to the point of arrogance, and his arrogance makes him dismiss Batman, and any other opponents, with a vile amusement that is probably flip and sarcastic, and tied very much to his angry and bitter \\"soul.\\" Also, to note one example that comes up as negative, I have seen the \\"climb\\" out of the prison described as \\"too long,\\" or \\"boring.\\"  Nonetheless, I really liked the technique of revisiting Wayne's attempts until he finally took the blind prisoner's advice and climbed \\"as a child,\\" without the rope. Now, I'll concede that after the first two attempts, I was already telling myself, \\"he has to do it without the rope, like a kid,\\" but I think Nolan wanted the audience to be a bit ahead of Wayne on that point, because he kept showing the footage of the kid climbing, and the absence of the rope was pretty obvious. To me, it shows that Batman/Wayne is still having difficulty getting his mind/spirit back to the point where he can battle Bane with any chance of success, and Nolan just lets us see that before the character does.<br /><br />Some folks have criticized Nolan's portrayal of Batman/Wayne as borderline crippled over an 8-year period, but he is just human, after all, and it shouldn't be a shock that his emotional loss in The Dark Knight sparked a long period of withdrawing from everything. If you believe Batman is simply a man in great shape and with great martial arts training, and with a few other skills, then you will accept that all of that can be lost through neglect and carelessness and a sorrowful apathy.<br /><br />OK, I'm in danger of rambling here, but I guess my point, for what it's worth, is that I have watched all three of the films in this particular Batman series.  I have really enjoyed all three, but I've been waiting for the true \\"Nolan\\" twists to show up. Batman Begins was extraordinarily tame in its \\"Nolanisms,\\" and then The Dark Knight seemed much more a Nolan product (esp in the Joker protrayal), and finally in The Dark Knight Rises, the \\"true Nolan\\" finally shows up, especially in those scenes where the action is so fast and shocking that it is almost bewildering, which is what you get in Inception (albeit for different narrative reasons). As for the ending, should Nolan have left Batman's fate more ambiguous, and would that have been more effective?  Possibly, but as it stands, Wayne's fate is something about which only the audience, Alfred, Lucius, and Selena truly know. From an emotional perspective, I just liked that touch(with no excuse).<br /><br />There's other little stuff too, like the way Gordon is brought down and chastized for allowing the lie about Batman to continue. Gordon has been a true shining star up until this film, and he does his best to get his police force back on board, and he ultimately makes sure Batman's image is reversed, but there is a point, after Bane reads his speech, that Gordon is justifiably portrayed as pathetic and helpless. Again, a Chris Nolan technique that produced in me a profoundly sad feeling.<br /><br />Yikes! This was a lot longer than I intended. I'm not trying to slam anyone else's review, or start a \\"review war;\\"  I'm just pointing out the personal perspective from which I \\"watched\\" this one, and I'm hoping some of you on the border might give TDKR another shot.<br /><br />Happy New Year!!!  Grace and peace, Rick.
B000HA4WTS|4.0|I'm a fan of street racing and tuning cars. I wanted to add this great movie to my HD-DVD collection. I had an HD-DVD player before a Bluray and wanted a few of these HD-DVDs as these are now cheaper due to being obsolete.
B0049GYXHC|5.0|My son and I watched it last night and it is one of our favorites. The bluray on HD tv is excellent.  We love it!!!!
B0041KXH2I|5.0|I'm a fan of Stephen King's stories and this is one of my favorite movies. Such a great movie that I wanted to share it my father, but unfortunately he speaks broken english and a lot of the story gets lost in translation. I searched for this movie in Italian and to my surprise Amazon had it. Now you can watch this great movie in Italian! Make sure you have a multi-region dvd player that converts PAL movies to work on NTSC TVs if you plan to watch this movie in the USA.<br />Ora poi guardare questo film in Italiano!
0805053883|5.0|look this book.  Traditional book for young readers and great illustrations.  Would buy again and again for all my friend's with young kids.  Great book.
B003HGKJ3M|5.0|Great album to own. It was great to hear the songs that weren't originally released. It was also nice to hear the several different versions of &#34;Take On Me.&#34; Great collectors addition for a a-ha's fans.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Loads of fun for the entire family!!  Very challenging levels make this a hard to stop playing game for all.
B000O59AF2|4.0|I'm a fan of Mission Impossible movies. I wanted to add this great movie to my HD-DVD collection. I had an HD-DVD player before a Bluray and wanted a few of these HD-DVDs as these are now cheaper due to being obsolete.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Easily one of the best books I have ever read. This book was very realistic, and that was it's best quality. I also loved how we see the main character really start to grow, and diminish as a person in general.
B000GUJF4G|4.0|I'm a fan of disaster movies. I wanted to add this great movie to my HD-DVD collection. I had an HD-DVD player before a Bluray and wanted a few of these HD-DVDs as these are now cheaper due to being obsolete.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Collins displayed a very good ending to a very good series. The theme of this book was very punctual, and to the paint. This book was very repetitive with word choice however, and should not be read if the other books were not read first.
B000E1MTZE|4.0|I wanted to add this classic great Trilogy to my HD-DVD collection. I had an HD-DVD player before a Bluray and wanted a few of these HD-DVDs as these are now cheaper due to being obsolete.
B003GYEGNO|4.0|Great read and very current - juxtaposes the 1% against the 99% while simultaneously exposing our cultural prejudices. Would recommend it to anyone.
B000O59AFM|4.0|I'm a fan of Mission Impossible movies. I wanted to add this great movie to my HD-DVD collection. I had an HD-DVD player before a Bluray and wanted a few of these HD-DVDs as these are now cheaper due to being obsolete.
B004XDYJRU|4.0|Great app. Find all types of stations and music. If you know your family tree go find music from the homeland.
006092988X|5.0|Was my mother's favorite book as I was growing up so I picked it one month for my book club.  Everyone unanimously agreed it was one of the best things we've ever read, in club and out.
B005KXV8XK|5.0|The early sounds of Deep Purple recorded live for the BBC is an interesting insight on the development of the classic Deep Purple sound. It is nice to hear the development of songs and the style that soon would make them famous. Sound quality is surprisingly good for these old recordings, and where they sourced them from. If you are a Purple fan this is a MUST purchase. If you are new to Purple this might be a bit too much inside baseball to start with. Try In Rock, Fireball, Machine Head or Made in Japan. If you already own those records then you will like this disk.
B0085P2Z6E|5.0|I like this game. it has a lot of find the difference and hidden objects puzzles. so if you are into that kind of thing get this game.
B001PPLIEG|5.0|Quantum of Solace was the perfect Christmas gift for the Bond fan in my life. Best of all it arrived before Christmas.
B003E6K1VK|3.0|IT's a good little USB DAC, but it lacks some features of the E17. Enter the E07K. It takes what's great about the E17 and applies it to an affordable package! If you're strapped for cash, this will do ok, but spend the extra $30 and get the E07K
B00821PCJS|1.0|There has to be some smidgen of believability even in the most outrageous SciFi.  I didn't believe it for one minute as at all possible.  I believed it even less the next minute.  This is for the youngest minds only;  mere kid-stuff SciFi.  After all, this premise has been done to death, and usually with poor results.  The characters were nothing and the kid-appeal was gearing up to superhero kids outdoing their parents/elders.  I just could not watch to see this same tired old act come to fruition.  I suppose we might expect some help from one of he aliens who feels sorry for the earthlings, etc, etc, & the usual etc.  I won't be watching any more of this.
B007G5O3K0|5.0|Absolutely wonderful album from one of the most beautiful voices ever recorded! Seriously underrated artist, at least in the States.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|This is a very good challenge. It gives a nice twist to the classic jewel games I've played in the past.
B0084IHVGG|5.0|Just like I remembered as a child. Such a good movie, transports me to a happy place. You will not be disappointed.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|This is such an amazing game for kids! I recommend this to the kids who love animals! I love it so much!
B007PFDJH4|4.0|Mcewan returns to his favourite  ethical conundrum - lies and truth..  this is not as compelling as Atonement but suggests a more upbeat ending. TEchnically excellent writing and apleasure to read. Probably speaks more loudly to a generation that grew up in the last years of the Cold War. BRitish cultural sensibility and assumptions.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I'm 11 but I don't care what they say about &quot;You have to be 13 to post&quot;.This game is just too awesome to not to post something.I would play this game all day but I can't because of school... DARN YOU SCHOOL! L.o.l.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I like the game some of the things are very hard to figure out the is no place that tells you what to do.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Wow!<br /><br />I don't generally prefer YA, but I loved Slammed and Point of Retreat, really disliked It's All Relative, so I had no clue how I would feel about this book. All the reviews were good, said it was mind-blowing, a must read. Well guess what? It is a mind-blowing must read book!<br /><br />I am not going to spoil this book or even write spoilers because every reader deserves the opportunity to laugh, cry, and fill their hearts with a ton of feelings for themselves, just like I did. Only one part I predicted, but the remainder of the 5 billion plots were unpredictable, grabbed me, twisted me, chewed me up, spit me out........Let's just say I finally put it down at 4 am when I could only see blurry lines on my kindle!<br /><br />Could not agree with the reviews more. 5 stars!<br /><br />Some of my favorite quotes that do not spoil the story:<br /><br />\\"Why Sky? Of all the guys you could be attracted to, why the hell is it Dean Holder?\\" - I thought this would be a story on mental illness, ha!<br /><br />\\"I'm losing it. I've completely lost any form of self-control. So this is what Six loves? This is lust? I hate it. I absolutely, positively hat this beautiful magical feeling.\\" haha<br /><br />\\"...leaving me parent-free for the weekend. To most teenagers, this would be the point at which they pull out their phones and post an invite to the most kick-a** part of the year. Not me. Nope. Instead, I go inside and decide to bake cookies, because that's the most rebellious thing I can come up with.\\"<br /><br />\\"I can't even move, because I'm sort of afraid he's crazy. I mean literally, clinically insane. It's the only logical explanation for his personality. And the fact that I still find him so incredibly attractive can only mean one thing. I'm insane, too.\\"<br /><br />\\"I live you, Sky,\\" he says against my lips. \\"I live you so much.\\" - How sweet!<br /><br />\\"I'm not coming in any further,\\" he says, putting his hands in his pockets. \\"Why not? Are you a vampire?Do you need permission to enter?\\" - lol<br /><br />\\"Everything about is so natural.\\"<br /><br />And, since I just noticed I highlighted 30 quotes, I will post only one more:<br /><br />\\"I've been looking for you my whole damn life.\\"<br /><br />Oh em D Oh double G! So HopeLes! I really loved this book! Cannot wait to read it again, especially now that I completely understand Holder and his...behaviors! Happy reading!
0399160450|3.0|My husband found this book too technical for him.  He does not work with electronic equipment.  However the story line was very interesting he says.
B000JMKQX0|2.0|Problem...if you don't connect to any of the characters of a book, what's the point? It was so interesting in the beginning, but then the amount of profanity and the fact that I couldn't connect to any of the characters made me put it down half-way through. Bummer. Not a good use of money.
B003UESJF6|5.0|We adore this movie because it shows the bad guy in a whole different light and how the good guy sometimes gets tired of his selfless acts.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|The game is really good.  Reminds me of the games from when I was a kid.<br /><br />Decent graphics and controls
1419705849|5.0|Book came fast and in perfect condition.  My son has been wanting this book since it came out, we have read all the other books in this series.  So far this book is just as good as the rest.  We read a little of the book each night and have really enjoyed it.  It is a great book for boys from 3rd to 6th grade.  It gets kids reading and enjoying it at the same time.
B005LAIGLE|4.0|Good movie, lots of action, even though it is not a family movie. Wish they had left out bad language.
B009CPJHY4|4.0|This is a Fun story with a great cast. Maggie Smith is hilarious as usual. I enjoyed watching this movie.
B00005JSGK|5.0|The whole movie on one DVD instead of two vh s. Fast delivery. Great condition. It plays great. It also had special features and the preview that was show for the movie.
B007MB5OCE|5.0|I haven't enjoyed a book so much in such a long time. Loved the characters. Would especially recommend to baby boomers.
B008AK8FHM|2.0|The book gave no real details of his experience. It just wasn't a good book.It didnt really explain enough for me.
B009WO7NQO|1.0|Just another in the miseries of the Kindle Fire vs the IPAD.  Bought my son a KF for Christmas, and three days later I am already regretting it.  Right now as I type he is on my IPAD playing the free version of this game because he says it is way better than the bought version I put on his KF.  Do not buy this game whatever you do, total waste of money.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Just simply amazing. I can't find the exact words to describe the greatness of it...it just pulls you in and doesn't let go even when the book is over.
B001NB545Q|5.0|Have enjoyed he Who's music and performances since my early days in college.  Unlike me, their music is ageless and entertaining.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Love this game. I can't put it down. I want to keep playing until my kindle fire finally needs charging. Something I start with in the morning and late into the night. Really great game.
B008L1DNGI|4.0|great game that plays quite well on a touch screen. charging for what basically a 6 year old game is a bit weak tho
B005LRWRZ8|5.0|Dave and company are treasures.  These guys have been nominated many times for grammys, and they really should have won each time.  It seems like people either love them or they don't, but I would recommend them highly.  Keep on rocking!!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Loved this book! Will read everything she writes.  Had me right til the very end and then wham!!! Not what I expected
B001DJLCRC|5.0|This is one of the best tv shows ever.  All of the characters are unique.  You really like some, and hate others, but can't ignore any of them.  Just perfect.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I really did not know what to expect when I started reading and really enjoyed the story of love  and seeing viewpoints of Kids living with cancer  it was heartwarming and funny.
B0012GMXLU|5.0|When you buy or listen to Motorhead, you come to expect one thing, hard hitting heavy metal.  Well, this cd doesn't disappoint.  Buy it, turn it up loud, and enjoy.
0307887448|5.0|I listened to the audiobook version of the book and enjoyed it from beginning to end. I have recommended it to many friends - especially ones who enjoy spending their time in virtual worlds.
B000294SFW|5.0|These guys should have been in the rock and roll hall of fame years ago.  They don't know how to make bad heavy metal.  Everything they do just rocks.  Lemmy is a much better writer than he ever gets credit for.  These guys have never pretended to be anything other than raunchy rock and rollers.  We need more of this!
B009MCRHH6|4.0|The first several stages are addictive, then for me the game got a bit too challenging.  still a fun game
B008SOS63S|5.0|Wow!  Powerful entertainer.  I had feared that these type of multi-talented musical geniuses were fading away.  But Joe is alive and well, and he can rock with the best of them.  Great singer, song-writer and fantastic guitarist.  Saw him in concert and he and his band were superb.  Just wish he would cut loose and solo more; not that he doesn't jam, but I know he has a ten minute guitar solo in him.  Keep listening...
B005COO1X6|4.0|Loved the story. Only wish it were younger. Sometimes children are smarter than adults have a chance of being with their lack of belief in the unbelievable.<br /><br />Dixiepep
B001RTSPVY|5.0|This show just keeps getting better.  You find yourself thinking about each episode, and wondering what would you have done....
B009MCRHH6|5.0|It makes me think and it is completely fun. It is an awesome game for all ages. One of the best games I have ever played.
B00753MBHA|5.0|Udo was/is great, but the new singer has really pumped a lot of energy into this band.  Solid 2nd effort with the new singer.  Hope they tour a lot to support it. Can't wait for the next cd.  Keep going guys....
B005XQ973M|4.0|Kind of a hard pill to swallow learning about the atrocities placed upon the Chinese residents of Nanking. Very troubling to see the &#34;pattern&#34; of sociopathic hate and activity of the Japanese conquerers. As an American, to understand the ruthlessness as the Japanese Military is to understand what drove the Americans to consider and then act upon the dropping of the bombs on H and N.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I enjoyed the 3 book series. Once my wife talked me into reading the first book I could not stop. The last book is just as interesting as the first 2, plus the epilog at the end helps tie things together.
B0018RWD6S|5.0|Coltrane and Hartman compliment each other's talent. I wish that there were more than only six songs on the disc.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|I've had downloaded this for my four year old and now I'm addicted! Fun for everypony (or Brodie) you know
0553801473|5.0|Needed this book so i can finish off the series. It's one of those series that you have to go all the way through on.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I can't wait for books two and three.<br />I read this after having seen the movie but it was still great. I will be finishing the trilogy immediately so that I don't have to wait for the movies
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This book may not be something unique, out of the ordinary, or different, but I can assure you that it is an amazing romance novel. From the moment I began reading, I was hooked! It's simple, heart-touching books like these that we miss out on all too much. Conner and Megan are two people who are brought together by fate, and though their situation is not ideal or usual, they find a way to work through all the flaws. They find a way to love! Their relationship is one we all envy. I strongly recommend this book to someone who likes the basic, romantic, brings-a-smile-to-your-face read!
B004SJ3AXI|3.0|I need help understanding instructions, there's not enough info on that.  I need to learn projectory and which size bird can do in damage
B008O2T3O0|3.0|All in all, this is a 'traditional' presentation of Rigoletto. Generally, enjoyable, though not first line, production. Same can<br />be said for the singers -- not first line, but none bad or grating. Leo Nucci (Rigoletto) and Piotr Berczala (the Duke) are the<br />best here -- both as singers and actors. Elena Mosuc (Gilda) is no Netrebko or Fleming -- her voice lacks beauty and<br />control and her acting is tepid. Leszlo Polgar (Sparafucile) is weak. The orchestra is very good, conducted with power and<br />panache by Nello Santi. I liked the pretty staging and smooth direction. Video and audio are served well by the Blu-ray<br />recording. Bottom line: for 9 bucks, I would recommend this recording to any opera lover, even as a second Rigoletto<br /><br />An interesting wrinkle... The disc is shown on the Amazon site a Region B (Europe). The disc I actually got from Amazon<br />was region 0 (all regions), with a frame rate of 29.97 fps (indicating a US original format). It should play on any US player<br />with no problem whatsoever. The disc contains a couple of hours of video snippets. Most are too short to actually enjoy<br />but may serve their purpose as samplers for people contemplating purchase of other ArtHaus MusiK Blu-ray discs (BTW,<br />I do recommend their La Traviata with Angela Gheorghiu and Ramon Vargas).
B0063IH60K|4.0|It's ok I like playing and its easy to learn, slides on glass instead of clicking but I have to increase my speed
0761163808|5.0|Among all the Christmas gifts my video-crazy grandchild received, this book .Safari,<br />was a traditional gift he was excited about. It is wonderful for recreational reading but I expect may be informative for future school reports. I plan on buying more copies.
B008JGSM6G|3.0|I thought this would be more entertaining...I've only tried the easy levels so I have to repost a comment when I play a higher level.  Good for all ages no violence
B002WYH5N2|5.0|OMG if I have to sit and watch this movie just one more time, I think my head will explode.  I'm not allowed to talk or even breathe during certain parts of the movie the wife loves.  I bought this set to replace the one she originally had that got ruined.  The wife absolutely without a doubt loves this movie and the music.  She blasts the TV while watching it.  She will even sit and watch it again and again each time it finishes.  The wife now has 4 different versions of this story on disc, this version of the movie, the original and 2 different BBC versions and she will watch them all back to back.<br /><br />It keeps her quiet.  Earplugs are a man's best friend.
B005HSL626|4.0|I like this game.  It's not stressful to play and I can do relatively well with it as I'm not into violent games, good for kids too
B00003JRCQ|5.0|The wife only watched this movie once and then switched back over to watching Pride and Prejudice.  I'm sure she enjoyed it though and will soon go on a Persuasion kick and watch this movie repeatedly.  It just hasn't happened yet.
B0085P2Z6E|5.0|I won't usually write reviews but this one deserve a good review. Very much satisfied with this. Nice to play, wish little more difficult and less stress on eyes.
0446573019|5.0|She will eventually read this book as she loves Baldacci's writing and prefers the hard cover books.  She will never switch to a kindle, there's just something about having a hard cover book in hand - so she says.
B00AMBH70S|2.0|There is no Jason Bourne, or much of anything to do with him, except vague references and a few other character glimpses.  The plot is thin and goes almost nowhere.  Where it does go is predictable.  Wait for something to happen for two hours by watching this or paint dry.
B001PU8N0I|5.0|I bought this movie for my wife and she absolutely loved it.  She has watched it repeatedly since receiving it.  Only drawback is I had to keep getting up to swap the discs for her because she was too comfortable and LAZY to do herself.  But hey, it kept her quiet for days, so it was well worth me getting up every few hours to change discs to the next one.
B004O3YGMC|3.0|Works with my Nexus, but not my ipad mini.  Consistently tells me I've got the wrong password (I don't) or that there's another session ongoing (there isn't).  Support forums offer some help, but their solutions don't work for me.
B002XTBE6K|5.0|Again, I bought this movie to shut the wife up.  She has watched this movie repeatedly and I only needed to get up once to change the disc for her lazy ass.  But again, it shut the wife up for hours as she watched the movie.  Well worth the value.<br /><br />Wife says it's a very nicely done version of the movie.
B004KA9UXO|5.0|You know a book is great when you find it hard to put down, and the hours fly by racing it. This was my experience. Remember the movie, that as a kid, I did not sit though as it looked boring. Loved the book. The world of Dune, the characters developed, the scheming, twists and turns, all played out superbly. Would recommend it to anyone who loves a big thick fantasy read.
B004SIP7AS|5.0|The wife is a Jane Austen fan.  Any movie out there made from a Jane Austen story, the wife insists I get for her.  It keeps her quiet and so what if she has 2 versions of Emma now.  She loves this movie.
B005FVNIW6|5.0|This book was recommended to me ages ago. When I finally got it, it ended up being a book that you found hard to put down. The pace of the story slowly built up. The start was slowish, as the character of Ender and his family was developed but the pace steadily increased. I've not read the following books in the series,as this one was so good, I'm almost scared of being disappointed. This book is a classic.
B003L20IHE|5.0|this is one awesome movie , it is a heartbreaker, it will bring tears to ur eyes, it is a movie where u can sit and enjoy without having to get up and miss a part
B009E3EY38|5.0|I got the Deluxe Version with the Blu-Ray Concert and Bonus DVD of a rehearsal.  Before viewing the set, I had read reviews of the concert video editing as being too quick between shots and distracting from the performance, and reviews of the bonus DVD video as being too static.  In my case, I found both videos to be fine and appreciated both performances as performances.  For one thing, you get a rare opportunity to see the difference between the band in a giant stadium setting and in a more intimate setting of a rehersal.  Another point raised in another review was some different choices in playing and singing the songs between the two.  BTW never went to a Led Zep concert, but bought every album in LP when the came out.  Still have vivid memories of riding home on my bike with the 4th album and stopping by a library to play it on the way because I just couldn't wait!  I played the BD three times the day after christmas!  Enjoy!
B00866JL96|5.0|this is one of the awesmome movie that i watch the most, it is a very good love story of two young kids n love , it will take ur breath away, i recomdment this to every one
B00999DFP0|4.0|Ths is a great series when you can watch it without commericals that encompass more time than the show itself . Ordering multiple seasons is a more cost effective way of buying the program .
B005LAIGSM|5.0|this is a very romantic, love story, it is heartbreaking and bring tears to ur eyes, i would recommend this movie everyone
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|When I first saw a trailer of an episode from Season One I said &#34;Wow&#34; ! Season Two does not disappoint in terms of action and drama .
B003NHRIVQ|5.0|this is one of my favorite movie, it is a tear jerker and a heartbreaking movie,  i rate this a 10 plus
B0049P1VHS|5.0|This series , if you are a sci-fii / horror fan is top notch. I can't wait for Season Three .
B00AATV046|5.0|Great story with great actors.  One of our favorite's every year.  I still wonder how they did some of the special effects, especially the ice skating.
B0041KVV8U|5.0|Excellent, I love it.<br />I love vinyl.<br />This music was made ​​to be heard on vinyl, not cd.<br />I know nothing about mastering or remastering, I just hope that the music sounds good and it does !!!
B005FISBTO|5.0|An enjoyable 6th season. Looking forward to the 7th season. I have yet to find anyone that doesn't enjoy this show.
B0063IH60K|4.0|just downloaded and I love it.  love that i can personalize cards and background.  daughter loves it as well.  so many options.  ads are a bit annoying but not too obnoxious.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|if you like to kill monsters and level up your character to fit him with good armor then you need to get his game right now
B008MEM24S|5.0|This little app is fun for both kids and adults! It's just as fun with out the sound, which makes it great for waiting rooms! Once installed it doesn't need the wifi so you can use it literally anywhere. Great App!
B00A80SHFM|4.0|For those who have listened to the original recordings, they will probably find this version lacking in some aspects. Understandably, the performers are not at the level of the original broadway performers, and this shows in the song. However, the fact that this album was recorded live during the shooting of the movie gives listeners a whole new experience. Listening to this album after watching the movie makes me appreciate each song a lot more.<br /><br />That said, I do wish that this album included all the songs that were in the movie instead of just the highlights. My favorite song from the movie that is not on the album is \\"Little Fall of Rain\\".<br /><br />In the end, this album probably doesn't compare to its predecessors in terms of quality, but what it lacks in quality it makes up with raw emotions that are evidently heard through the actors' voices.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|I bought this for $3.99 for a Christmas present.  I can't wait for the kids to watch it.  They loved  the book!
B008KE3960|3.0|My husband downloaded this onto the Kindle Fire and hasn't said much about it so it must be okay.  Nothing to brag about but okay.
B005HSL626|5.0|Very simple game, but very addictive at the same time. We all take turns to see who can get the highest score.
B004EFYZ1C|4.0|I live spinning the moon around and how it adjusts the schedule, angle, and lighting of the moon. I was confused how to get back to the present time and location, but the words popped on the screen (as if detecting I was lost) telling me to hit 'Back' to return to the 'now'. Love it, although I didn't see any schedule for solar eclipses.
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|Classic train, Christmas, Santa, fun movie! Not only do our kids enjoy this movie but even fun for the adult kid in the family:)
B005HSG3TC|5.0|Very sturdy and provides good protection. The hand strap on the back of the case will definitely come in good use.
B00457WZEI|5.0|Great book for relaxed reading and entertainment.  I read this book with my students and enjoyed the discussion we had together.

B001UJSW6Y|5.0|Conventional opinion is that this opera is a second class effort by a second class composer revived only for a favored diva at the close of her career.  The fact that Olivero came out of retirement to sing it and Tebaldi, Scotto, Freni, Caball&eacute; and Sutherland sang it during the later years of their careers tends to give credence to this opinion.  Closer to the truth, I think, is that only a great singer with sufficient experience can do justice to this role.<br />I must confess that I have become a sucker for this ultra-romantic melodic and gorgeously orchestrated opera.  My first recording was the Olivero, Simionato, Corelli, Bastianini performance from Naples (1959).  Just about perfect casting and spell-binding performance.  Bastianini is luxury casting for Michonnet, but he sounds too young to be a father figure to Adriana.  Still... he sings beautifully.  Next I acquired Caball&eacute; (swoopy and swoony) and Domingo (blasting) and then Tebaldi, Simionato, DelMonaco (Decca).  In spite of DelMonaco's passion, Simionato's stupendous Princess and Tebaldi's committed heroine I remained unmoved.  I next bought the Freni/ Cossotto / Dvorsky performance from La Scala (Opera Arte DVD.)  Seen AND heard it is a bit static (but then, so is Madama Butterfly). Freni is excellent and uses her \\"baby\\" chest voice to good effect. Cossotto is dramatically excellent but her voice had lost all of its plush and the \\"core\\" can be a bit grating on the ears.  Dvorsky is not in the Corelli, Domingo, DelMonaco class, but never less that adequate.<br />Then I saw the reviews for this performance and decided to buy it.  In spite of owning many of her recordings, Scotto's voice is not favorite of mine.  Here, however, she is stupendous: the ideal blend of dramatic communication and a solid vocal technique. Like Olivero, her voice is not beautiful in any conventional sense, but she is mesmerizing in this role (like Olivero).  Domingo's voice blazes (no blasting here) and Milnes is the best of the Michonnets I've heard.  Obraztsova - while not in Simionato's league - is in good, if unsubtle, voice and projects a powerful, if unsubtle, Princess.  Levine and company cover themselves in glory: a gorgeous feast for the ears.<br />I recommend this recording as a first choice, with the 1959 Naples performance as an excellent alternative.  Just make sure that at least one of your recordings has a libretto; a synopsis is not enough for this highly text driven opera.nets I've heard.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Collins did a great job of keeping the reader interested and on the edge of their seats. I couldn't possibly put this book down.I thought that it was amazing. The Hunger Games is definitely a page turner.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|We are absolutely addicted to Downton Abbey. We can’t seem to get enough of it. It is so well done and the characters are very fascinating.  It a complicated community within its on walls.  There's Love, War and Class.

0439813786|5.0|An extraordinary book which each child needs in hard copy.  The book made a great Christmas present for several families.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It's large and easy to use...even after leaving the app it holds your last calculations for you! Also, it keeps a memory of what you've been doing so you can look back and check your work! Simple and easy to use!
B007THA4FI|5.0|When I started reading this book, I felt like it was boring and had way too many characters of too diverse of lifestyles for the author to ever bring it together in a cohesive manner.  WRONG!<br />Ms Rowling did connect all the characters, and dealt with the diversified  lives they lead.  I do recommend the book and looking forward to more from this author.
B007MS5B6Q|5.0|Pricey but well worth it! This is such a great piece for any zombie lover. I keep it on the shelf in my living (dead) room all year long right next to my walking dead comics. I couldn't be more excited to have a piece of Greg Nicoteros amazing art right in my own home. I was so inspired by it I got some liquid latex and made a few of my own zombie appliances for halloween.
0812984412|2.0|Sorry to be a detractor.  I can't get into this book.<br /><br />Mitchell has some great descriptions.  Very visual.  But this structure is disjointed, hard to follow and incoherent.  I really don't like the characters, who are pretty poorly drawn and mostly comment on their environment (so we never get to know them or care).<br /><br />Everyone will like something different.  I didn't get engaged in the beginning kindle pages but bought the book anyway.  Should have gone with my gut...so read the free first pages offered before deciding!  Once a book gets hyped does it just continue to garner good reviews?  Small matter...I don't like this book.
B009369Z8A|5.0|I love this era and the cast was wonderful. The storyline was just perfect. Forest was my favorite. It was a great account of the era

B00AMBH70S|3.0|at first peak the movie tries to make the connection between the Borne series and after a while it tries to imitate the Borne Legacy.  the movie as such takes a while before connecting to the viewers.  3/4 into the movie and after having watch the borne legacy does it make sense.  then the movie becomes similar to the first borne movie and uses similar - government versus leading couples quest of hide and seek.  the chase scene is a bit long.  and the end does not correlate with the whole idea of omnipotent government.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|el producto llego a tiempo, son de muy buena calidad, igual a las fotos, lo recomiendo a toda la comunidad

B005LAJ22Q|5.0|This is the greatest series of all time! I can watch it over and over again! I love The Walking Dead....
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|Ted had its moments where it caught me by surprise and had me close to tears. Other parts were saturated in the previews. I liked the movie but I'm glad I waited for the rental version. Had I paid more than 1.99 to see it I would have been disappointed.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|I absolutely love this show.... 6 episodes just isn't enough. I could watch it every single day.... Great storyline and characters
B008673ZAQ|4.0|Very reminiscent of 50 shades of gray, therefore became very predictable and conventional, just didn't have enough pizzazz. The trilogy could be condensed in one book
B0052GACNM|5.0|In this hectic world sometime it is nice to settle in and listen to something different.<br /><br />These duets are fantastic.  You of course can listen to the free samples of each cut prior to making your purchase.  The samples however do not do justice to the entirety of each song.<br /><br />I am thrilled to own these two cd sets.  As usual I copied mine to my home network and gifted the hard copy as an xmas present.
B000AM2L1O|5.0|My 2 year old granddaughter loves this &#34;baby&#34;.  She is just the right size for her.  Upon reading reviews about the scent, I was concerned, but she has a pleasant soft vanilla scent - nothing offensive at all.
B006KC4NK0|5.0|I have never been a Lego man.  Now my 30 something son IS.  Heck he still has his Legos from childhood? many of which are still fully assembled.<br />My middle grandson had fun with this one and as you can see from the picture above he ,with the help of my son, got it all put together.<br /><br />My son being and Engineer is rather precise with his data sets.  He informed me that Chase put 1.5% of the Batman cave together all by himself.  Chase is 8 but like his Grandpa sees no need in putting something together if you can get a sucker.... I mean your dad to do it for you.<br /><br />Sometimes I wonder who the Lego sets are really for.
0380730405|5.0|I love this author.  Great writing, great story.  Thanks Amazon for a great price.  I am now reading du Maurier's other books.  She has that effect on the reader......
B004XGN8W4|5.0|Fun for kids and adults alike... I first came across this product by means of a co-worker, you can place any gaming system inside it, excellent gaming screen contained within. It can be used at home, in hotel, or while traveling (if your vehicle has outlets or with use of a power inverter)...
B00AMBK6J2|4.0|I'm a huge Family Guy fan, so Ted was right up my alley. It's more or less a two-hour-long episode of the show. It's also casted by many of the voices from Family Guy.<br /><br />In short, I rented this on a recommendation from a friend and it was way funnier than I expected.
B008I3QZKU|3.0|I ordered this for my husband, whose taste in music is always a mystery to me. I stopped buying after the Beatles. But it must be good, because he has good taste in music, according to the kids.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|awesome app.  tie it into meshin calendar and one of the page share apps and you have a powerful synergistic tool.  I'm still learning how to maximize it's capabilities, but it's great even with my limited skills at this point.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love it. It's great fun. Easy to play, even a helpful hint for those questionable times.  A good game.
B008ALAHA4|5.0|I wouldn’t really say that I love it, but it does do what you need it to. Fits nice and snug, lets me use my new MBP Retina with my old Cinema Display. Not like there are many other options, anyway. :P
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I love it.  It was very accurate even the first time I used it.  It said it would start snowing at 2PM and it did.
B00ADYY7MA|5.0|Excellent soundtrack!  If your a nashville fan you have to get this soundtrack.  I highly recommend it. Can't wait till the winter season starts.
B0053O89WY|5.0|Big Bang is the best sit com on TV now and for a number of years. I can now relax commercial free with the dysfunctional foursome
B008476HBM|3.0|Difficult at first, but soon after enjoyed the love story.  Loved Elizabeth's character and Jane.  Darcy was frustrating!  Mrs. Bennett was quite comical!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I read this book in just three days. I would definitely  recommend this book. It kept me guessing what was  going to happen next and  I couldn't  put it down! Love  it.
B005CGI4EG|5.0|I truly am enjoying every episode of Married with Children.  I did re-package the DVD's, making them easier to find.  I also cut and pasted the content sheet on each jewel case so that I knew which episodes were in each DVD.  Great value.  I would recommend it to anyone.  Note: When I viewed them on TV originally, I thought they were somewhat risque, however, now compared to what is shown on TV, they are mild and funny.
B005DOL0R0|5.0|It's just what I was looking for.  Easy to open and work with. The material seems to be good.  I hope this last for a long time.
B00018D3RI|5.0|I have enjoyed viewing this series again.  I had never watched the pilot, and I enjoyed it very much.  I do like the new captain better than the one in the pilot.  Excellent entertainment.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I am not a fast reader but I couldn't put it down....  I love sparks and this was a favorite for certain.
B00A3AUGEW|5.0|I love Philip Phillips so I couldn't wait to get the CD! Out was my Christmas present to me. I couldn't be any happier!
B0070NSPCU|5.0|If you like Patrick Rothfuss, Steven Erikson, George R R Martin and so on, then you will love Anthony Ryan. I was captivated.<br /><br />The plot is one of the fantasy world's standards: boy in special school learns to be a master, befriends people of power, successfully fights evil and grows to great renown. But, as with most good tales, its not the plot but the telling that delivers joy. And Ryan tells it superbly! I so enjoyed his wordsmithing.<br /><br />I will not go into great detail because a lot of fine reviewers have already done so. But I will urge you to read the reviews and download a sample. Once you have done so I feel confident you will read and enjoy this work.
0345803485|5.0|The condition of the book was brand new, the story was awesome and looking forward to ordering the remaining books in the series.
B000BGR4ZW|5.0|I have been an Isaac Asimov SiFi reader for years now.  When I saw that this was for sale, I had to have it.  It came as a used book but for being some 45 years old, it is in AMAZING condition.  Price and delivery was great.  Thanks.
B009H442DG|1.0|I got this for my mom because she is a huge John Travolta fan. I thought it would be fun to have the 2 of them reunited for a new CD. Something has happened to their voices over the years. This is almost unbearable to listen to. All I can say is I am glad 100% of the proceeds go to charity. At least my purchase helped someone!
B000AP04OM|5.0|I purchased this for my wife who Loves this movie.  It was a bonus that it was the 40th Anniversary set.  If you have seen it on the T.V. it is never as good as watching this as a full length movie.  Cost and shipping were Great.  Thanks.
B0032KPE0G|5.0|I love this movie!  Terribly funny throughout the entire thing, but my favorite part is the beautiful and sentimental speech at the funeral.
B005XLN97M|5.0|This Barbie house was easy to put together and took about 10 min. to assemble.  It s also well made and sturdy when being played with.  So happy I purchased it and I looked at the reviews before doing so.<br /><br />Thank you<br />R Angrisani
B004SJ3AXI|3.0|This game along with many new games are a challenge for me, however, I continue to play to learn the strategy.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|Have used this for years on iPhone but hated to pay for it again for Android.  Record feature is great.  Once you set-up a free account with Tunein your favorites follow to other devices, including Squeezebox.
B005HSL626|5.0|I have enjoyed this game a great deal already! It will be a great way to procrastinate on things I have to do...
B0091VGAXK|1.0|I may have been expecting too much...  I graduated in 1987 which is supposed to be the year this movie takes place but they were off on hair and clothes styles which was dissapointing.  A lot of songs by Pat Benatar, Journey and Foreigner came out in the early eighties so that was another inaccuracy.  I thought the casting was bad as well.  Why not cast Stacie Jaxx with someone younger and taller that looked more like he belopnged in a hair benad???  The actor who played Drew made the character seem like someone who would have gotten his butt kicked-he couldn't pull off the rocker tough act at all.<br /><br />In the last scene at the concert, Sherrie's outfit was ridiculous!<br /><br />This was a total waste of time and could have been done so much better!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|The goal is to take the various birds who have various actions,  and stretch them back on their rubber band,  and aim it at the green pigs, and knock them out!!!
B008AK8FHM|3.0|It's a well written book but I was disappointed to find 3/4 of it is about his education/career/family and less than a 1/4 is actually about Heaven and describing it. Would have liked to have more about that but it was a good book.
B004LWZWGK|1.0|The film itself is great, and the Blu-Ray transfer is great, but the inclusion of Ultraviolet is crap. I'd rather have no digital copy than have Paramount try to force UV, which I do not want, on me. Bring back the iTunes digital copies!
034580404X|5.0|Bought as a present and didn't read the books.  Shipping was great, fast, and like any other purchase got a deal and got exactly what i wanted.
B007PVHMCG|5.0|I bought this set from the Lego website for $34.99.  Just put your email in the \\"In Stock Notifications\\" and they'll let you know when it's back in stock.  My son is really into Lego and Minecraft so this set sent him over the moon.  He put it together with the help of his father in about 15 minutes but has since taken it apart and makes up his own layouts.  Again, super fun at the normal retail price.  Wouldn't recommend you pay more than that for this small set.
B009X01C64|5.0|I don't think this product could be improved.  It provides great protection and the automatic on and off feature is so handy.  Also, leaving the charging plug and volume control available in the case is helpful.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|At first I wasn't sure I would like the letter format but it ends up being a good book. Flew through it in a couple of days. Easy to read, no confusing plot or storyline. I thinking people can relate to the character in someway.
B005DOL0R0|5.0|Fits the  Kindle Fire with padded protection that keeps it from  accidents, and enables you to carry it without worrying about scratching the screen.<br /><br />Would recommend buying it with your Kindle Fire as the price is very reaasonable for the piece of mind it gives.
B005DOKM9M|5.0|Excellant cover, fits perfectly, works great. Cary your kindle fire any and everywhere without worry or damage. I like it.
B00005MP58|5.0|This is the best version of Pride & Predjudice. Perfect casting and accurately follows the book. I would watch it every week if it wasn't five hours long.
0345803493|4.0|My other daughter got the first book so I order the other two other books for my daughtert - arrived in time - and I will ask if I can read it after she does
B005WUHAX8|5.0|I bought this for my 14 year olds iphone. She loves it because it is thinner than the otter box and is just as durable
B0086700CM|4.0|pretty fun and entertaining game and definitely good for the reflexes... my kids and I both enjoy it a lot... seems to run and perform good.
B0079R8IYW|4.0|I bought one of these last year and it wasnt so good becuase it come up on the screen so much. this one doesnt come up on the screen as much.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great book. A little different from what I thought it would be. Getting started on book two. Can't wait to read what happens next.!!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love how this app utilizes the entire screen. The keys are so large and so easy for me to see. This is a wonderful yet so simple app.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book is just like the other ones:amazingly funny and filled with drama.This book is really funny and I see why people wouldn't read it.
B009POCFTG|1.0|So trashy its pitiful.  Why would Matthew McConihay EVER agree to do this movie?  One of the first scenes is full frontal from the waist down of a female standing in a trailer door with the camera pointing straight at her.  I thought the movie was about a psychotic hitman cop, which is really only an after thought in this movie.  The Jerry Springer like family is the real focus of this movie. Don't waste your money.  Glad I only rented it instead of buying it.
B009CGYO0K|4.0|It was a hilarious book but not for kids it was a little inappropriate. I read the whole thing in like 30 minutes. It won't let you read the book until you rate .
B004SEUJ82|5.0|This was a awesome movie it got sad to but it is so loving so get it such a good movie
B003O86FMW|5.0|This . Is an amazing books it's so good and addicting and you just get absorbed into it like Ignatius that is in the book. 5 stars!!!
B0086700CM|4.0|I love this game, but the lagging kills me. Literally. Every time I play for a little while, it starts lagging and I die whether I did the right move or not.
0547564651|4.0|This is the full-blown book of a previous New Yorker article by the author.  The premise is that there are intangible characteristics that parents can develop in their children that are better guarantees of success than mere academic performance.  The author clearly researched the topic thoroughly and marshals his arguments well.  I had two issues with the book:  the first is that much of the author's argument centers around the strength of the maternal bond.  This brings back the disturbing history of how autism was once blamed on the lack of maternal love.  I suspect much of the maternal bond data is skewed by the fact that there is often no paternal bond data to track (but I freely admit that I'm not an expert in the area).  The second issue is that many of the characteristics that are non-academic that supposedly lead to success also would result in academic success, which somewhat negates the author's premise.  Overall, however, I think it is a worthwhile read and certainly gives much for parents and would-be parents to think about.
B002U0KHMY|4.0|Matt Bomer is excellent in this series and the supporting cast is good as well. Started recording this on my Tivo and was well into the second season before I started watching the first episode. Long story short I burned through the first season and was pretty well caught up to season two in just over a week. I would regularly watch 2-3 episodes back to back! Definitely worth the time and if you don't get USA network the dvd's worth checking out.
B007PT1PEY|5.0|Love my Holmes. Reads well in different readers. Kindle best. I must admit I am an Amazon zealot...but buy my ebooks from B&N. Am waiting to see how the waters go next year but meanwhile, gotta kiss the ring.
B000KKPN5C|5.0|I received this as a Christmas gift. Though I haven't used it a lot I'm very pleased with it so far. One thing that may not be apparent is the flash lens tilts up so you can bounce it off the ceiling. The body doesn't turn though so if your looking for that you'll have to look elsewhere.
B001BSH11G|5.0|Great accept for that the vinyl LP package was missing the lyric booklet!  One of the reasons I bought the vinyl LP.<br /><br />Missing: http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/ciu/78/9b/11cbc060ada045aba9e51210.L.jpg
B0052RE4MQ|5.0|I loved all the action and adventure in this book. I couldn't put it down out was so captivating. I can't wait to read Reached and finally find out what happens to Cassia, Ky, and Indie and try to see the world through their eyes.<br />- Thanks for listening
B003PIUBZS|5.0|My husband and I stayed awake all night watching the first season of Sparticus.  We knew nothing about this show - had never heard about any of the seasons; I bought the dvd set for my son for Christmas during a Black Friday sale on a whim.  He has always been interested in the Roman Empire.  We watched the first episode with the family (adults only due to the graphic violence and sex).  After that, we were hooked!<br /><br />My husband and I enjoyed the first season so much that we bought the second season before we had completed watching the last episode!! We are waiting for it to be delivered!<br /><br />I was sorry to hear that Andy Whitfield died and because of his impressive acting - I researched his life and discovered that he was a great husband and father.  Our world will miss him.<br /><br />I hope that Liam McIntyre does as good a job as Andy did in his portrayal of Sparticus.  I must believe that he did since the second season was also rated highly.<br /><br />I don't often buy \\"seasons\\" of anything, but I believe that these are DVDs that we will watch again and again.  Thank you, Amazon.com
B0063IH60K|5.0|if you like basic solitaire this is the app for you. it has good graphics is well done with fun options
1419707671|5.0|We spend lots of time and energy trying to get our 9-yr-old daughter interested in books.  The \\"Wimpy Kid\\" series has been a winner for her - so I knew I'd need to find a box of books in this series at a reasonable price.  I was so pleased to find this hard copy box set.  It was less expensive than buying three of the paperback books individually.<br /><br />She, of course, is pleased. She read book #4 in a day and a half!! AND to keep her reading at (almost) any price is worth it to us.  Thank you, Amazon.com!

B00APUYWYA|5.0|Pitch Perfect is a great musical that is very funny and also entertaining. I could watch this movie hundreds of times and it would never get old!
B005IZLPKQ|5.0|filmed in old style with modern technology, can be a bit hokey at times but since it was modeled after a comic book that should be expected
B004H83IM8|4.0|I gave this collection 4 stars because you get all 3 movies for one low price.  If you are looking for a deep, academy award winning movie that will have true meaning... THESE MOVIES ARE NOT IT.  If you are looking for the caliber of police academy, naked gun, airplane, baseketball, etc.  then you are in the right ball park.  I bought it because it was a great deal.
B000002C4J|5.0|This is a wonderful cd! I love all of the songs on it. Celine hits a lot of high notes! Been a fan of Celine for years. I would recommend this to anyone!

B0015DYIH2|5.0|I loved the movies but the books were so much better, I loved them. Awesome job. Wish there were more.
B004EPYZQC|5.0|Hands down the best movie in the series so far, could have had more racing scenes.  Love the fact that this movie was filmed in a country where you would not think there was a market for this
B005FMZVLQ|5.0|A great shop, a beatiful watch, impressive, A good price and a great gift for Christimas. I love it. ok?
B00AA7O22U|3.0|I'm not a big fan of sequels, while this one was entertaining I kind of wish there was more to the plot.  Definitely a guy movie.

B0089Q1TPM|4.0|This movie brings back memories and is just so funny.  Some would say not the best Mel Brooks movie, but I always enjoy it.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I enjoy playing  this game. The only downfall is the pop up ads when you are replaying a game. I have already skipped the ads, but they keep coming back.
B000EHSN9Y|5.0|Stick with brand name adapters (IMO). Arrived in a well-sealed bag and fits into the Mini-DVI port on the back of my iMac. 5 stars for a well-engineered adapter.
0375869026|5.0|We are on vacation is Florida and I gave this book to my 11 year old son for Christmas. He is passing up the pool, passing up the beach and many other activities to read Wonder.  He says its the best book he has ever read.
B008J1QFLU|5.0|A magnificent publication, very competitive price. We will appreciate it more as time goes by, but the whole Ring is a daunting production.
1451695195|5.0|Having seen the interview with the author  I sent for the book straight away and it did not disappoint me . It reaffirmed all that I have believed for years of being a christian and I would recommend it to anyone and everyone.
B000641MB6|5.0|So grateful this movie is on DVD and in the original black and white format. Such a magical story that puts you in the holiday mood so well.
B009VB7QQA|3.0|Story was ok, but the video stream timed out too many times for my liking. It made me loose interest in the movie while I waited for it to load or catch up. There was a whole sequence where I had no sound, only video.
B000HIVIOW|5.0|The first time I watched-listened to this movie I was spellbound. This silent film uses the most majestic and magical music ever to tell the story. I love the hand drawings as well. Timeless magic!!! I watch it every Winter Solstice to remember my childhood days in the snow.
B008GXHOFW|1.0|After downloading it told me I needed to download a feature for the Kindle Fire (I just downloaded it from the fire store? so why?) The 2nd download times out I tried it 5 times and gave up on it. Might be the best game on the planet but I can't play it
B009JBZH54|5.0|This movie pack is great. I have always loved all of the batmans. It is set up great. It comes with a picture book, sketches from the movies etc. Overall very happy with this purchase.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I couldn't put this book down because I was so intrigued. However, I have never been so disappointed by an ending. I wanted nothing more than to see justice be served and was totally ticked that they both went back to normal lives.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|This game is a master, it weaves a story that rivals those of shakespere. Yet it is still a video game!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|always work for my son when we go on long trips. pop it out and it will definitely work for him.
B001UV4XUG|5.0|This was a gift and as far as I know, the recipient enjoys this movie.  I haven't seen it so I cannot give it a fair review.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|I was thinking this would just add on to some of the great things from FHB - but it turned out to be a ton of new information that asks yourself to be challenged again ( even if you skip half the book).<br />Nice job!
B0060FXDCG|5.0|This was a Christmas gift and the recipient liked it.  He wanted all three movies and thought the boxed set was great.
B007ZXK08C|4.0|Very clever and interesting thriller with an unexpected twist in the middle. It also explores the human psyche and asks the question, just how much do we know ourselves and others? A real page turner I read it every spare moment I had over Christmas. Interesting ending. I would recommend it highly.
B007THA4FI|2.0|She introduces far too many characters... it's hard to keep track of who they are and their importance to the story.  i didn't get through the book.  I won't be trying to pick it up again either.
B005OLF6BI|5.0|We bought this for my daughter and she loves it. We have since burned to to her Touch and she enjoys it on the go too.
1423136802|5.0|These collections were bought for my 12 year old daughter. She already read the books but wanted them for her collection. She also asked for the demigod diaries. These collection has a good pricing and will try to get more of the author's books. Good for the ones who like the mythology themes.
B005HSL626|5.0|Fruit Ninja is an easy game that involves slicing every fruit on the screen.Zen mode is nice and easy.Classic mode is challenging with bombs and lives.And Arcade mode is amazing with all those power up bananas.
B008XG1X18|5.0|works just like you were on their internet page.  Hope they don't change it for the worse with any future updates.
B009E3EY38|5.0|I was a little nervous for some reason when I started watching this (I saw it in the theatre).  I was afraid I might be in for another Live Aid let down or something like that.  I had heard the epic reviews and the internet buzz when the actual event happened...but had no idea if this would be as good as all that.  Never fear, you need to see this film.  The guys prove that the hype was legit.  I was so stoked when they launched in to some of my faves like \\"For Your Life\\" even if the performances of \\"Dazed and Confused\\" and \\"Stairway\\" seemed a little pedestrian.  But hey, it's LZ doing Stairway which is better than 99% of the music on the planet so who cares if it was an obligatory performance?  The show seems to get better as it goes along, and by the time \\"Kashmir\\" comes on I had tears in my eyes.  No joke.  This show is riveting.  I bought the Blu-Ray so I could continue to experience the awesomeness of this show, which really defies description.  I am not sure if non-LZ fans can appreciate how incredible this show is, or what the band accomplished in doing this.  They took it seriously and rehearsed for 7 weeks for this one event.  Jason Bonham did a good job of honoring his father and staying true to the original material and live nuances developed over multiple tours in the 70's.  If you love LZ you probably already have this set, if you have a passing interest only you will witness a one-night-only reunion that blows away any of the other weak attempts by older bands of this era.  It's pretty awesome.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This is a great game.  It starts you out with a few mini games, and you work for the rest.  Almost every mini game that I have played in this game so far was great.  I like this game.
B000YXMMAE|5.0|Might be their best album.  Incredible.  I cannot stop listening to this.  I try and listen to other music and within a song or two I go right back to this album.  Just buy it.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I thought it was a very funny book and I couldn't put it down. I loved it. I have read all of the books and you have to make another book!
0385536828|2.0|i have loved several of McEwan's novels. This will not be among them. Serena who supposedly narrates the novel is not any woman I have ever met. I had no empathy for any of her observations, or conclusions. With a degree from Cambridge, a reader might hope for a degree of common sense, none here. So disappointing I could not feel for this woman. If you are a speed reader like Serena, it will help you to endure this slow moving novel full of one dimensional characters.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Not as good as the first two. The sex was not as good. We did not really learn what happened to the marriage.
B0051UP5NQ|4.0|Does what it says. Word and spreadsheet works flawless<br />Easy to Use Does what it says. Word and spreadsheet works flawless
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This was the first free book I read on my kindle, it was a great start and a pleasant surprise. It was definitely an easy read
B0027Z9C2I|5.0|I was skeptical as I don't care for broadway musicals, but it was an awesome movie.....fun, funny and some great music.
B0084AZXKK|4.0|I enjoyed the the plot unfolded in this story. I also enjoyed the characters personalities and attitudes when trying to find the treasure
B004X75RCW|4.0|Sandra Bullock is great in this flick.  Betty White almost steals the show, though!  Full of funny moments....Sandra's comedic timing is great.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|You just can't stop reading once you start...keeps you wondering! Great read for those who like mystery and murder. Loved it!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a great,fun game to kill time or to just enjoy the challenges. Who woulda thunk something so visually simple would be so addictive!
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Congratulations Mr. Andy Weir...You kept me glued to my Kindle for the duration of Mark Watney's sols on Mars.  I enjoyed the technical aspects and the manner in which you presented the solutions...and the surprises.  I will be watching for other titles.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|I am satisfied with the cord, it fit nice and snug and it does exactly what it is supposed to do.
B00AGE20ZI|4.0|This movie is wonderful to watch any time of the year but particularly wonderful at Christmas.  It's light and entertaining but it also carries a deeper message about not forgetting what's really important in life.  Fantastic performances by Cary Grant, Loretta Young, David Niven and Elsa Lanchester.
B00000E7MF|5.0|A wonderful addition to any Frank Zappa collection. It had been many years since I last listened to Joe's Garage, and I don't think that I ever listened to the entire CD. Another incredible release from a true musical genius.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|for the second time the game has reset back to the beginning. first time I contacted customer support and they were suppose to give me some coin and cash so I could rebuild. still waiting on that and I had almost built back to where I was and it crashed once again. time to uninstall the free game not worth my frustration. sad too I enjoyed it.
B00AMBH70S|4.0|Loved it and enjoyed the expanded story line interwoven into the original story with Jason Bourne.  A nail bitter all the way!
B0094JX07I|5.0|Just another addition to their amazing music. Not a single song that I dislike from this band. Plus has my favourite song so far, Surprise Surprise.
B0075PYG1M|3.0|I think that this is a pretty solid cd. Musically it left a little to be desired for me. I also think that he did not get everything out of the stars that he has performing with him. I have not listened to this as much as I anticipated based upon the star power and the reviews. Maybe its early and will need to grow on me.
B0058YPGVQ|3.0|As the seasons go by, the show focuses more and more on scenes of extended dialogue between, and soulful close-ups of, various pairs of characters as they interact with one another and agonize over various moral dilemmas. It's a bicycle gang, for goodness sake, not Hamlet!! Even so, I can't stop watching, and each episode is still good for one shoot-em-up bloodbath. :)
B002MQYOFW|4.0|The book was great, not really a dull moment, I would have liked it to go on to the reunion at home.
B003FSTN52|5.0|Somehow, I missed watching the first season of this series on live TV. Then, when I finally saw the dvd, I was immediately hooked. Outstanding writing. Each show both fits into the larger story arc and presents its own mini legal drama, as well. Julianna Margulies is great in the lead and is a beautiful lady, although she must be tiny, as evidenced by the height of the heels they make her wear.
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|If you enjoy his other books you will enjoy this one as well. Quick read and books always better than movies.
B008Y2VTIS|4.0|The sets and period clothes are still top notch. The plot is beginning to feel a bit repetitive. Still good TV, though.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|hey just sitting in front of my t.v. wondering &quot;should I get the thing or not??&quot; thanks yo you guys you really help me!! so should I?
B007Q0OUKS|5.0|My son loved building this- the figures are so detailed! Lots of cool moving parts and fun to put together.
B00004UEDQ|5.0|this arrived within the time frame. it was not damaged at all. the packaging was very good and it worked well.
B007Q0OUNA|5.0|Lego makes terrific sets- my son loved putting this together. Only sad thing is that a figure of Sam is not included.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|Beautiful, just beautiful.  Miss Boyle's has a haunting beautiful voice.  I loved Donnie Osmond on a couple of the songs.  He was awesome.  Very calming.
B005XLN97M|5.0|Everything was perfect! Shipped on time & my daughter loves it.  Its her first barbie house so she is excited for it
B005LAIH4A|5.0|Our whole family loved this movie.  It's really cute and daughter was excited to get it from Santa.  It was the best price I saw anywhere!
0525953728|5.0|I'm not going to spoil it for anybody, but I found this book very interesting.  I am not a big book reader but I couldn't put this book down.  If you are the curious type and don't like settling for what the media tells you, then buy this book.
B002BWP49C|5.0|It's what I expected and more.  I love the commentary.  Great part one of the best Twilight Saga movies.  :)
B001HN69AY|3.0|ok movie could have had more interation between the reality of one and the reality of the movie.  a concept we have see before
B00005JNBQ|5.0|Great humor...makes me laugh everytime I watch this movie.  The awkwardness that Napoleon endures is painful and hilarious.  Good pick for a ridiculous movie kind of night.
B000HEWEJO|5.0|Great Christmas movie makes you nostalgic for yester year especially if you are from the older generation and remember people were nice and kind when tragic events happened to each othe and their goal was to be good unlike today.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|This is a great product, with an easy download to my Kindle, good to not have the ads in the game so my son won't but more things for me.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|Good for older teens. 17 year old daughter liked it, 14 year old son did not. Throwing up could have been left out.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This is a great product, with an easy download to my Kindle, good to not have the ads in the game so my son won't but more things for me.
B001F12J48|1.0|This is a review of this 3D version.  My children were so excited.  We sat down for Christmas Eve veiwing of the 3D version and we all immediately felt dizzy, sick, blinded!  ALL of us felt this way.  It was impossible to watch this movie through the 3D glasses provided.  Fortunately it came with the regular 2D movie, so we immediately popped out the 3D version and watched the 2D.  3D version and glasses went straight in the trash.  DO NO BUY.
B008HK3XKO|5.0|I have purchased 3 Marware cases - initially for my Kindle, then as a gift and now for my new Kindle Fire.  To me they seem to be the best quality and usability.  I have never had any come apart.  Very good quality.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|I love this show and i continue to follow it now into season 3. Its a must have and it gets better with each show.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|well told story. the author puts you seemlessly right in the story. very descriptive with out being wordy.  the story moves along with a pleasant flow while the story is a harsh one. it reminds how full life is even as time passes in the most stressful of circumstances.  the words of this story are beautifully laid down.
B005LAJ22Q|4.0|Got it for a great price during Black Friday weekend plus its a great show. Could not pass up the deal.
B0079R8KO0|5.0|These cases are not expensive and provide a terrific way to protect your kindle. The multiple angles the stand can move in is very helpful.
B00APUQPX6|4.0|I own the first three segments, and reviews were indicating that maybe the story line was getting old. I REALLY wanted to love this one....but....won't be buying this to watch over and over like the earlier releases.
B005J4TLN4|4.0|If you liked Shaun of the Dead or Zombieland (also great movies) this is a must-see. Funny and fantastical, yet tries to be believable, and I think it pulls it off.
B007FG9LIE|4.0|I could hardly put this down. It read very quick. Many twists. I will definitely read more of his books.
B00913P6G0|5.0|The album is cohesive and on-point throughout. Lamar's raps are developed and his flow is remarkable. Good production to boot. If you're a hip-hop head this is a no-brainer. Even if you're not really into hip-hop this album may just get you hooked.
B007FRHZ4A|4.0|The game was everything it said it would be. I found that the sling shot part was a little tricky for the kids to manoever, but they were able to look at the cards and re-create the set up fairly easily. Overall it's been alot of fun for them and they've enjoyed it
B00908DDZM|4.0|Great production by Lewis, balance of meaningful and silly/fun lyrics by Macklemore (good flow too), just a general pleasure to listen to all around.<br /><br />Favorite Tracks: Thrift Shop, Same Love, White Walls, Can't Hold Us
B007SGM084|5.0|Loved it, loved it, loved it. I don't personally live the lifestyle in this book, so not into the bondage thing, but living vicariously through Ana Steele was wonderful. After a friend mentioned this book to me, I sampled it, but put it on the back burner for awhile. Later, after seeing more and more people talking and going on about it, I decided there's gotta be something people like, so maybe I should read more of it... then I did, and couldn't put it down. 24/7 I was stuck. There was a lot of sex, but it wasn't \\"dirty\\" if that makes any sense. And like someone noted, book two and three really helped the plot and character development.<br /><br />Reading from Christian's POV would be very interesting - if not better than Ana's POV. The sample at the end of the trilogy was teasingly wonderful. Hoping there's a 4th.
B00AGOGOLE|1.0|I tried to download this product but it said it was infected malware was so disappointed i wouldn't recommend this to anyone..
B003G4W49C|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. Taking me only three nights to read, the book felt shorter than it actually is, because with every page I was eager to absorb the words on the page and move on to the next one. Being a fan of fantasy literature more than science fiction, I can safely say this book has the ability to draw in readers of all ages and preferences. 5 stars for being the first science fiction novel that never forced me to skip a dull chapter in order to get hooked into the story again.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I chose this rating because it was a so- so book easy to read but predictable in where it was going..
B00A757EFW|4.0|i REALLY LIKE THIS GAME, PRETTY EASY TO PLAY, BUT I DON'T HAVE AS MUCH CONTROL AS I WOULD LIKE-
B008HK3XU4|5.0|Brought this to protect my kindle also love the color and it is easy to use..I would highly reccommend it..
B00A757EFW|1.0|This review form is very on user friendly. It take so long I doubt I will ever submit a review on your products again. the Pacman game was lame I could not even complete 2 levels.
B008IYSMLY|5.0|The picture quality was great.. Although the recap of the previous episode was distorted, but went away 15 seconds later..
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|This is one of the better games like this I've played...the graphics were amazing and the story line was easy to follow. I played stray souls as well and that one was way too creepy and sinister for me. I don't like carnival stuff, either--animals in cages, creepy music, clowns...but there wasn't too much of that stuff. The mini puzzles were too easy for me..'m I played on expert mode and still finished in a couple of hours. Overall though this was a top quality game.
B008XBASVY|5.0|Easy read, amazing story. Highlighted on almost every page. I recommend this book to anyone looking for a good read.
B005CGI4EG|5.0|The packaging is weird for the DVDs (they are on top of each other). Other than the weird packaging this collection is great! I purchased this for Christmas last year for my girlfriend. She has watched this every night since I got it.
B009JBZH54|5.0|The Dark Knight Trilogy- this has been one of the best purchases ever!! nice trilogy collection... ..... ........ ........ ......
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|My kids love to play this game.  It is a good game since they have to use logic, reasoning and their brain.
B003ZHR6RK|5.0|great movie wanted it for the collection ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
B000JMKTLO|5.0|Would highly recommend!  I hard a hard time putting this book down!  Interesting from beginning right to the very end.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Have fun but the ahhhhhh when things fall over the side get annoying and so I turned off the sound
B0086700CM|5.0|I really love this game but it is a challenge. but still as my title says it is a really good game.
B0085Z3B2Q|5.0|My teenager loves this movie. It is worth the extra money to get a combo pack, especially for a digital copy.
B004QX07G4|4.0|On more than one or five occasions I actually laughed loud enough for someone to ask me what I was reading and what was so funny. My response was \\"Ellen, of course!\\"
B004EBUXSA|5.0|Good compliment to the Gigabyte motherboard I bought. Fast, no problems whatsoever. There is a newer generation out but this one will serve me for several more years. Very happy with this purchase.
B006T3RM08|4.0|Works as demonstrated.  Really holds the 2 components together nicely.<br />Initially install is a little tight.<br />I have no complaints
1451627297|5.0|I've always been a fan of King's work. That of course made me want to like this book. But I was surprised how involved I became in this story with King interweaving elements for fans while also telling a totally new tale of his lead character, Jake Epling and his discovery of himself in a surreal surrounding of time travel and historical context. This book is truly a perfect storm of adventure, science fiction, romance and self-discovery/improvement. Well done Mr. King!
1451627297|5.0|Very entertaining...keeps my attention. Look forward to picking back up each time!  Packed with facts from the era as well as a fiction story line that gets you right into the characters lives...
B005LAIIS0|4.0|Fast and great service, Blu-ray was in great condition. I didn't pay attention that it was a rental therefore I was unable to view the speacial features on the disk so that was a bummer but other than that, I was pleased.
B0063IH60K|4.0|This game is a good one.  Thanks for the free version, it is nice to get a free version, and not a charge.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Pleasant surprise. I thought I might find it too mindless, but it was enjoyable and very romantic. I will definitely consider reading more from this author.
B0081J95TE|4.0|I love Garbage and this album is great! There are a few songs that I skip so it doesn't get 5 stars (few albums do).
0525952926|3.0|I will preface by saying that I am a big Follett fan and really had anticipated the release of this book.  I notice that this book had a higher average rating than the first one which is really a surprise.  I'd give the first one 4 stars and this one 3.<br /><br />Positives:<br /><br />-Follett has a way of writing a book with multiple characters and story lines in a way that you keep up with each character and \\"not lose your place\\" even if you put  the book down for a few days.<br /><br />-Easily readable for a 900+ page book.<br /><br />-Characters that you can identify with (even the ones that are rich) and want to cheer on or despise.<br /><br />Negatives<br /><br />-Needs more historical background to help parallel the historical events with the action in the book.<br /><br />-The portion of the book involving the Dewars being at Pearl Harbor is just ludicrous and unrealistic.  A Japanese pilot ignores the harbor full of US boats and JUST HAPPENS to start shooting at a car with a US senator in it?  REALLY!  I understand that historical novels need parallels with famous characters and events but this stretches \\"happenstances\\" so far that it breaks.  This became comical rather than a part of the story.<br /><br />-Dialogue between characters is often very predictable.<br /><br />This is a good read but this book has problems with being a believable tale of that era.
B002N5N4M6|5.0|The three movies I purchaed came quickly & as advertised. I was very pleased with my purchase and would use this vendor in the future.
B00899F0G8|5.0|I couldn't stop watching. I can't wait until the new episodes come back on. It was worth the money spent on the instant video and it was so cheap! Will be watching it again and again for sure
B00AB0AXU6|1.0|This movie did not do the franchise justice.  I liked the other films but this one is a massive FAIL!!!  I would list the plot holes buy I am limited to 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 characters.  If you like watching things explode and cleavage, you might add another star.
015626224X|5.0|It is indeed rare that an author is able to capture the essence of a particular group within a society, even rarer when the author's words make one believe he is member of that fraternity; yet, this is how George Orwell made me feel while reading his book, Down and Out in Paris and London. I do not wish to suggest that I now comprehend poverty, nor would I be so pretentious to do so. My understanding of poverty does not reach beyond the life of the college student selling his plasma to eat, or the brief associations with the homeless and the hungry via small donations that too often lead one to a sanctimonious disposition. I add this caveat only for those who would accuse me of cheapening the experience. I do not know poverty but Orwell made me believe I did.<br /><br />Down and Out is an unusual genre for it is not only historical-fiction but it is autobiographical. Orwell is telling his story, embellished for effect, yet it never reads like an embellishment. The reader is taken on a matter of fact rendition of an English writer who moves to Paris, then London and can't find work for some time. The writer lives and sleeps in gutter holes, brothel-like hostels, and underneath bridges on cold, wet nights. He is forced to pawn his clothes for bread and margarine, and scrape together cigarette butts to feed a strong addiction to tobacco. Night after night our \\"hero\\" goes hungry, and yet we do not find ourselves hoping him well because we feel that we are there with him, we are hoping well for ourselves. We are cold and we are hungry. Our hope is gone. We want the hunger to cease but how could it? It isn't poverty we think about it is the unending hunger. It is the cold. It is the loneliness.<br /><br />And yet with all the squalidness that comes with being down and out we realize that the fear we once had of being poor is gone once we've arrived. Orwell intelligently writes, \\"There is another feeling that is a great consolation in poverty.... It is a feeling of relief, almost of pleasure, at knowing yourself at last genuinely down and out. You have talked so often of going to the dogs--and well, here are the dogs, and you have reached them, and you can stand it. It takes off a lot of anxiety\\" (21).<br /><br />As our experience of being truly poor comes to a close, as the pages bring us to its end, we learn with Orwell that \\"[we] shall never again think that all tramps are drunken scoundrels, nor expect a beggar to be grateful when [we] give him a penny, nor be surprised if men out of work lack energy, nor subscribe to the Salvation Army, nor pawn [our] clothes, nor refuse a handbill, nor enjoy a meal at a smart restaurant. That is a beginning\\" (213). Our poverty is over within a few hundred pages but there are those who will live out their meager lives hungry and cold, lonely and sad, and their last pages are the pages of their lives, not merely cheap paperbacks. George Orwell was a master craftsman, and his words convey us, for a short time, to a place we do not want to be, with people we really do not want to be with. Read Down and Out and experience poverty in the safety of your home.almost of pleasure, at knowing yourself at last genuinely down and out.

B002WV5A9G|5.0|The story is put together so well, with a great combination of characters and the way old ones are included with the new. The storyline about time travel in order to continue the ultimate Star Trek voyage makes it the best movie saga besides Star Wars.
B00A2BTCM4|5.0|The re-release of this cd is just great...I can tell a major improvement from the first time around. I own the original cd. It sounded great then and the remastering and improving the sound makes it much much better.<br /><br />The additional DVD is just great as well.<br /><br />EXCELLENT!
B005HSL626|4.0|Got this for my daughter for her Kindle Fire and she loves it...everyone in our family loves it! Fun for all ages
B00772M1F6|5.0|Saw JD and his wild band on Letterman, and as Letterman said, \\"Ya gotta get this album where they sell it\\" The stand up base player was so much fun to watch. JD is truly an old school Rock and Roller. I'm glad he left the Punk scene. This music is so damn good, especially if you grew up in the golden Rock & Roll era of the 50's & early 60's. It will bring up great memories, trust me. JD hits this entire album out of the park. If you don't like this, you won't like any old Rock & Roll!<br /><br />If you don't like it I'll buy it back from you.
B004J64QSI|5.0|This was a gift for my daughter and she really loves it.  Great product and was shipped quickl and arrived on time
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I am addicted to this game.  I rarely play games, but this is so much fun.  Levels get progressively harder to solve.  Five, six, and seven were pretty much no-brainers and build your confidence.  After that it gets harder.  Once I start, I can't put it down.
B005LAJ23A|5.0|Great, I love this show and this was a much better value than the other version of season 1. It shipped sooner than expected and it arrived early, great service.
B007MS5B6Q|5.0|This thing is just too cool. got it for my bf for Christmas and he absolutely loved it. you actually use the screwdriver in the eye to open the neck to get the DVD in and out how cool and gross is that. i love it and it's and awesome way to display our favorite TV series.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I enjoy playing games but sometimes there isnt anyone to play against and this does the trick. Keeps me engaged.
B009SMW9IW|4.0|Tracey Thorn's voice and approach on the songs in this seasonal collection are perfect for setting a mood of a holiday season that shouldn't be squandered by solely focusing on the material and illusory of tinsel and lights: it's about getting to the heart of how we truly feel during this season, and maybe why. Great stuff. &#34;River&#34; and &#34;Sister Winter&#34; are particular favorites.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|I like playing but i agree with everyone it takes way to long to build up energy and im not spending money to play game
B0052RDHTM|5.0|This is a great book, to be placed along the classics of Novel/ History tomes.<br />Getting ready for the next one in the Trilogy.
B004EFYZ1C|4.0|This is an easy to use app with amazing graphics. to The fact that you can retro and future picture phases is useful as well.
B00A77II0U|5.0|very interesting and fun. original storyline. first hidden object game for my new kindle tablet and worth the $2.99 price so far.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|We have been reading it every night since I put it on his Kindle Fire HD 7&#34; version. I know when we finish it we will buy all the Diary of a Wimpy Kids book on the Kindle.
B0071DJZZA|4.0|This is an adolescent novel but still very entertaining from an adult viewpoint.  It does leave you eager for the continuation of the story.
B00AMBK6J2|1.0|very poor streaming, ordered HD version, but had to switch to normal DVD quality as streaming was constantly interrupted. don't usually have this problem when streaming movies with Netflix..
B0052RDHTM|3.0|Very slow. Lost interest numerous times and finally quit reading and moved on to something else.  Will finish the read when I have nothing else to work on.
B001B56ITA|5.0|One of the Tramp's best albums, every track is great, especially with the awesome SHM. Must have for any CD collection, but don't pay these ridiculous over-inflated rip off prices. I purchased mine from The Music Specialist on E Bay, save yourself a ton of cash!
B006LSZECO|4.0|Well written and held my interest throughout, although I wasn't crazy about the ending.  Not because the ending was bad, but throughout the book things were well planned out in just enough detail, but the ending they just threw at you and that was it.  It was like she got tired or writing and just abruptly ended the book.  Other than that, it was a good read.
B005HSG3TC|3.0|This is a decent case for the price.  A number of people commented about it not standing up when you flip the cover around. Mine works just fine. Some sort of screen protector would have been nice.  I have not accidently dropped it yet so I cannot say how well this case will protect the Kindle fire. I can tell you it  is definitely not an Otterbox.
111846446X|5.0|My son got this with his raspberry pi and spent Christmas day reading it.  Good intro on how to get started as weel as advanced ideas and tips.
B0017I1IZA|5.0|I gave this book five stars just like I have the others in the series. They are funny, exciting, and just a great read.
0375869026|5.0|My children love to read! LOVE! She had this book read to her in school and just HAD to have it! She's 9 and her slightly older sister loves it too.... Has us cracking up too!
B0017APPT8|5.0|I can remember seeing Men In Black in theaters back in 1997 with my parents. I've enjoyed the movie a lot ever since. So I was happy to finally get it on blu-ray.<br /><br />What we have here is a science fiction comedy take on the \\"paranormal legend\\" of the mysterious Men In Black; a group of men wearing all black suits reported to randomly approach private citizens after seeing things like UFOs. Here, the MiB are a super secret organization reporting to no government agency or branch who monitors all alien life on the planet while protecting Earth from violent alien threats.<br /><br />Agent J (Will Smith), a new MiB recruit, and K (Tommy Lee Jones) investigate reports of an alien called a Bug illegally landing on Earth looking for a marble sized object/galaxy belonging to the Arquillian Empire and its prince. If they don't recover the galaxy, an Arquillian ship will destroy Earth.<br /><br />Of course Men In Black is not intended to be a hard science fiction movie but primarily comedy. Men In Black is entertaining and well acted. I thought the blu-ray quality looked nice.<br /><br />Though I do think the CGI for the Bug, while not bad, looked a bit dated. I remember it looking a lot cooler and more threatening as a kid. Though one must remember this movie is nearly twenty years old now.<br /><br />Very much worth a watch if you've never seen it.
B009NPK1IO|5.0|I didnt enjoy that the final season was only 10 episodes. But they did a great job of tying the whole show back together for the ending. It will be missed!
B000002GWN|5.0|This  music brought back some beautiful memories from the past. It is always a favorite of mine. What more can I say?
B0051UP5NQ|1.0|1 star for not being up front about the types of information the app collects and for what reason.  There is no reason this app needs &#34;all access&#34; for office productivity.  I am disgusted that a developer would even put their name on this, knowing the hidden agenda and the type of bad PR this will gain.  The app itself works quite well for opening and editing microsoft files on the go.  Despite its performance, it is always running (likely for less than desirable means) which will surely kill your battery.  Save yourself the money and the time of dealing with this poor implementation of an office app on the go, there are other alternatives that function similarly, without the bloat and the data mining risk!
B002N7W3NK|5.0|Ther was a missing dvd and that one was it! It was a feast for both my ears and my eyes!
B004DTXJ4S|3.0|And why do I punish myself every time by watching it?<br /><br />  I will admit that I've been waiting a good while to see RE:Afterlife. I always catch these things when they hit the video shelf. I like Milla Jovovich for the most part she picks some interesting movies to act in. I admit my 3/5 is biased because I like her. I never liked any of the Resident Evil movies because they never stuck to the story of the game. It's kind of just cameos mixed in with random action. The games aren't like this at all. Actually the playing the game is closest to The Walking Dead. You most of the time are trying to get from point A to point B while making discoveries and running into people along the way. You never actually try to take on Umbrella like Milla does in the films, matter of fact no one has supper human strength or does any of that stuff you see her doing. You don't get an arsenal of weapons or anything and if you're lucky you might find one good gun or two and fire it only when you need too because ammo is scarce.<br /><br /> Also I've never seen Alice find a typewriter ribbon or blue and green herbs to heal her wounds. Although I will say she has impeccable inventory management when she showed off her arsenal in this film...Of course, I am kidding about nit picking all those little things. The movies never worked for me because they are always over the top and it's obvious that the people who created these films have never played the game...at all. The games actually have a deeper plot/story line than this movie. This is mostly Terminator meets the Matrix with Zombies. Resident Evil has so many good characters I don't understand why they created Alice to develop a story around. This isn't really Resident Evil if it has nothing to do with any of the characters from the game. It's just a Zombie science fiction movie using the Resident Evil trademark and some of the themes from the game. Aside from those two things nothing else about the movies has anything to do with the game.<br /><br />Now how is THIS movie? Well? That's the thing I'm trying to point out about this series. This movie is the exactly the same as the last two. It's just Alice fighting Zombies and then at the end facing the Umbrella Corp. again. The zombies at least have evolved somewhat though, and aren't the usual biters. However,  they are just in the background and not a major part of the story (seems strange for a game about zombies). The plot of this movie is about Alice finding out what happened to a refuge station called Arcadia. She just does exactly what she did in movies 1-3 to get there.<br /><br />There is a lot of action in the movie, it's cool and it's fun to watch Milla do what she does best on film but these movies really have nothing to do with the game they are based off of. They took the games plot and characters and completely destroyed it all. At this point in the series it's too late to care and too late to complain so I just watch the movie knowing what to expect and leave it realizing I saw exactly what I think I would see. Like the console game the movies too seem to be trying to dish out as many sequels as they can to cash in on the franchise.the game.<br /><br />Now how is THIS movie? Well?

B000002ADT|5.0|It exceeds all expectations . Regardless of some of the more disparaging remarks about product packaging I have to say the sheer magnificance of the King of Jazz left me on a high note . Accomplished , versatile and exquisite .
B005LAIHSQ|4.0|I got envolved in this movie would not recomend for young children, my three year old though it was scary.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|I can never get enough of John Corey. From Plum Island to The Panther, DeMille keeps me up half the night.  The Panther is funny, thrilling and provides an inside and accurate look inside the middle east culture and the war on terrorism. DeMille leaves plenty of room for more Corey novels that can't come soon enough.
B004EPYZQ2|5.0|I was suprised at how good this movie actually was, can not wait untill my grandkids come over to watch it again with them....
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|This cable fits all the devices it's intended for and it works perfectly.  I only wish the Kindle Fire was released in Australia so that I could recommend it for that, too!
B002XXLKHY|5.0|Really puts you in the Christmas spirit.  Will Ferrell is great in this flick.  Everyone ends up happy and you'll go to bed believing in Santa.
0425252868|5.0|Very well written. Enough detail to give you a real feel for the men and their mission, but not so much detail as to be laborious. Of note is the attention the book brings to the utter detest that many Luftwaffe pilots had for Hitler and Goering as well as a sense of hoplessness they had while under the foot of a ruthless dictator. Bravo!!!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I loved this book shop much. I read it in a night because  I could not put it down. I cannot wait to see the movie!
B002ZG981E|4.0|Good visual effects, but rather confusing. Too many story lines going on at once to really follow it. DiCaprio is decent in it.
B0063IH60K|4.0|very good overall, I would recomended it as a basic game, same fetures as found on most other solitaire games
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This was one of the greatest books that I have ever read. It is a privilege to be able to explore the minds of two incredible characters. John Green is an excellent writer, and I hope you all have the privilege of reading this masterpiece.
B005LAJ1H2|3.0|Lots more blood. Way more breasts, all at the same time. a lot less talent. Just not as good of acting because the storyline started to unravel. If people get shot in the face and blood splattering everywhere was the plot, then they succeeded. Just lots of blood and my noncritical boyfriend, all of a sudden is saying \\"gratuitous nudity.\\" A new phrase for him! Now, the somewhat evil stripper, scheming mother was good. The weird political private party with the Berlin-style weird hookers wearing leather but fully have their many, many, multiple breasts jutting out in this stupid, meaningless weird scene where some fat politician gets spanked for his birthday, went on for minutes!!!!! What the eff does that have to do with Atlantic City?!!!!!!!! Give me some salt water taffy and show me the boardwalk!!!!! That is the name of the show! Not the Spanking Board!<br /><br />The shoot outs were too lenghthy and way to grossly bloody for me, and it just lost a story! It's cool if there's some story for it, but very, very gratuitous nudity and blood. I'll take a good story over that crap, anytime!
1451620829|1.0|I wanted to like this. I wanted to come away thinking maybe Paul and Gene were the bad guys, and Peter was the good guy and Ace was just the misunderstood one.<br />But I just can't. Peter seems so delusional and bitter that while it is a compelling read it is impossible to take anything he says seriously.<br />He condemns Gene for being a pig when it comes to sex but he talks about beating his wife, cheating on his first wife threatening to kill her and many other misdeeds. One of his big things that shows his character is he is ok with him having an affair with the woman who ended up being his second wife because she was a super model, but hated the fact that his first wife was getting the business from a guy in a low level band.<br />He talks about Paul being feminine and Ace being bi-sexual but dismisses his own homosexual dealings as guys just being guys. He comes after all three for their ego's but ultimately this book seems written to justify Peter's own ego.<br />He constantly harps on writing Kiss's biggest hit, but ignores that fact that the hardcore KISS ARMY hated it when it was first released. Perhaps most unnerving is the way he tried to protect his daughter from knowing what he had been like when he was first fired, but then he goes into grimy details and makes his daughter's mother look like a money grubbing whore. As a father myself that is reprehensible.<br />Ultimately, Peter, who has been in years of therapy, should know that blaming others for what's wrong in your life is a classical sign of someone in denial. He blames his parents for how he was raised; he blames his first wife for not being sexual enough, he blames his second wife and record company for all his problems related to drugs, he blames his lawyers for not getting him enough money during the reunion,, he blames Paul and Gene for everything he can. But ultimately he chose to quit school, he chose to marry young; he chose to be a rock star and party hard, he chose his lawyers, he chose to give in to Paul and Gene when he could have fought back.
0783229526|2.0|I really didnt get it. But I did like the whole bat country thing. The book is soooooooooo much better and easy to get and easy to laugh.
B003TJR2HS|1.0|Do not buy this product. I does not work, period.<br />You would think that this product is fool proof since it is only extending the connector but for some reason it will not work.  If you plug your iPhone using this extender there will be some functions on your phone that will not work correctly.
B001DJLCRC|5.0|I cant wait to see and buy the 5th season. We watched and bought all 4, and sold them, the day after we watched them, instantly. This is what tv and entertainment should be like and isnt! The acting is superb! The characters amazing and believable! they take something that I didnt think Id be interested in and just made it real, even though, it is is so unbelievable, but you KNOW and love or hate all of the characters, and the love and hate changes and is soooooooooo believable! Cudos to these guys, for real!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It is very good an has a lot of action on every page and is totally action packed,it's very amazing!
B008QE9XD2|3.0|It was cute and clever and Johnny Depp was funny, again, hooray! I really liked all the kitschy 70s crap and how they, actually, had a macrame room. that was funny.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|This book gave me a much better idea what a Navy Seal goes through just to train.  It was easy to read, hard to put down, and I felt like every work was his own.  I always had a great respect to the Seals, but because of this book my respect grew and they will always be in my heart.
B001HN694K|4.0|Well, i saw it a theater and i did highly enjoy the 3-d! You have to see it in 3-d! it was like being a little kid, again, and seeing the GOOD Disney epics!
B007HACDLK|5.0|I enjoying reading Vince Flynn's Mitchell Rapp series. It is thought provoking and makes you wonder if the CIA really operates like this. If not, it should. Also, it provides insight of different cultures and how they regards Americans.
B003Y5H53S|1.0|Just boring!!!!!!!!! saw it at the movies, hated the girl character, hated that annoying dripping sound. seems like it took place in a deserted desert and it did!
B0060FXBNM|5.0|Nothing much to say except this is an awesome trilogy to own. Bluray takes it to the next level in terms of picture quality and sound.<br />Comes with 3 individually cased and wrapped blurays inside the Trilogy sleeve. Each worked flawlessly as expected.
B00936A0RU|1.0|It was bloody and purposeless. And not well-acted blood. and why did the nude bloody chick have to run down the road? i was about to fall asleep until I saw that. the whole time i wanted to go to sleep. it was so bloody, but not that real looking and there was no freakin plot!
B0084IG8TM|3.0|not even as close to as good as the book and i dont think the book is all that, either. the characters could have been much more developed, just a big let down for such a big hype.
0061122416|4.0|I really enjoyed the story. As a journey, Santiago's tale is quite fantastic, however, the last section of the book left me feeling a little disappointed. It was pretty obvious Santiago was going to get his treasure, and by the time he does its easy to understand that his goal is not as important as the journey, but its the climax of the plot that I wasn't so happy with. This book is packed with \\"pixie dust\\" and the given notion that God is everywhere, yet at the end, Santiago is in conversation with the Sun and the Wind, which I found a little silly, and somewhat of a betrayal to the theme of the rest of the book.<br /><br />Somehow this story has achieved quite a celebrity status. Its a good book, more of a short novela than a novel, and worth a read. I like the author's style of prose (although the English version is a translation), but its direct, and moves the story along very nicely.
0547848412|1.0|eat him, already, or something! honestly, my boyfriend and i were trying to read it and nothing happened! we both hated it and couldnt get past the first few pages.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I have this game on my Android phone, but it even more fun to play on my Kindle Fire.  Also very easy to order.
0061124958|5.0|My 2nd grade teacher read us a chapter a day. It took every thing I had in the world not to bawl, out loud, when what happens to Charlotte happens!!!!!!! And that was quite awhile ago! I, at the request of my 11 th grade students, read them out loud that chapter. My voice trembled, as I read, and everybody cried! I, instantly, went out and bought the dvd cartoon, which is, also, excellent! On Monday, a girl from class brought in her copy of the movie. We made the exchange student from Korea cry, too.
B004TI5N38|4.0|Read this nonstop until the end! Would recommend to any Jack Reacher fans. Looking forward to more of John Puller!
B006ISJQ1W|1.0|the book was pretty good, the movie was unbelievably boring and lame!!!!! how it could be this lame, i dont know. nothing happens. also it veers from the book, and still nothing happens. and what happened to that wild, sexual dance scene from the book. well, nothing, cause it didnt happen in the movie.
B004SD5GZ4|3.0|Just ok the product is required for some programs on the computer so I had to download it.  Not that bad really
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book has touched my life in a way that no book has done in years. The letter format  makes you  feel as though you are Charlie. I would recommend this book to anyone.
B009VSW15Y|2.0|I was not impressed with this item it doesnt work very well and the pictures arent all that good. Just ok
B000ICXQOM|5.0|bruce campbell is a mans man, what other movie provides bravado, demons, ass kicking, a hot girl and a dude with a cyborg arm he built himself carring a shotgun in the dark ages fighting hell spawn. always a classic film for me, a recommendation for anyone
B008KE3960|2.0|Got this for my grandchildren to play but they were not impressed with the game.  Deleted it 2 days later.  They should give you a trial to play it before you purchase it.
B001A5HBAG|5.0|This show is a must.  It has everything.  It is also fun to watch if you're into retro '60 fashion and design.
B005LAII80|5.0|better than ironman,spiderman ect  I have seen them all no match to this movie. this is the universe I would love to live in as a judge uncorruptible unchanging and kick arse judge dredd is locked in a futuristic high rise with the dreaded moma the ultimate bad person who is calm smart and a ruthless drug lord. watch them play out this ultra violent ultra cool movie. This is a must see movie to anyone who likes movies that has a good plot and good action. this is not a good movie for Christians it has no god worship, it swears, has brief nudity and has no regards to the lord jesus christ which makes it a bad movie for religious people but other than that the best movie ever!
B008M721MS|3.0|This is a great product for the older generation. It is easy to use and read also.  The information is very user friendly. I would recommend this product to my friends and family.
B005O59C0K|5.0|If you don't love the greatest of Frank's recordings from the Fifties which are available to you on this re-issue, just stick to TV sports.  Frank may have been a kinda punk, but if he was, he's my punk.  HE WAS THE GREATEST SINGER OF THE PAST CENTURY.  I have owned these 8 classic LPs presented here since the 50s.  What a pleasure to be able to hear them 60 years later on CDs while in the shower or driving cross town, or in the back yard.  A super value at many times the price.  Excellent sounding CD set.
B002MFX0RQ|1.0|Ended without fully playing the movie  The movie itself is a classic and wonderful Yet the Amazon site failed to play properly
B0063IH60K|5.0|I like playing solitaire occasionally and enjoy doing on my Kindle.  I would recccoment downloading it on any typr of device it can downloaded on.
B0079R8KXG|5.0|its awsome fits perfect and its classie i would recomen it to every one and it makes a perfect gift
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love Pinterest; I could stay on it for hours and hours; it is addictive and I would reccomend it to everyone!
B005LAIH4A|5.0|Its my 3 year old favorite movie, she knows it by memory alredy and so do I...<br />but I don't mind because it teaches a great lesson of taking care of nature!
B0083TXXZ4|5.0|I purchased this for my 14 yr. old grandson and he loved it; however it was on his wish list and that is why I bought it.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Well this definitely opened my eyes to the world of grey. Must say I was completely captivated and surprised by that fact.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Another way for me to connect and another device to do it on.  Love Facebook.  Larger version of the one on my iPhone.  Love it!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is just an average calculator but it is a bit advanced but it works better and has a better understanding of the questions you are asking the calculator
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Loved this game on my iPhone and it is better on my Kindle Fire HD.  Just fun entertainment and addicting. as heck!  Love the noises and visuals.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I made the mistake of watching  the movie first. But the book blows away the movie. Hands down best in a long time.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Love games that make you think and this one definitely does.  Has a hint option which is very helpful.  Great way to keep your mind thinking.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Just read it. Incredible. So many relatable emotions. Charlie really brings you close to the struggle to fit in and survive high school and...well, life.
B004I1K430|3.0|Closed captions would really help for those of us a little hard of hearing. Otherwise it was great.  It can definiitly  be promoted as a historical picture.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|This book was absolutely beautiful. There are no words to describe how I feel after finishing the last page. Chilling, absolutely brilliant.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Awesome! Finding out the connection between everything and everyone was the best part. It's real and its full of love
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I read it in just one day; I couldn't put it down. I liked it because it wasn't fake. Everything that happened in the story could happen in real life. I got really attached to the characters because they reminded me if people I knew. I would recommend this to anyone.
B00A7ZWUJC|4.0|I bought this at a low low sale price and was pleasantly surprised that it was not just a two or the good tracks kind of album
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book is so touching and heart warming. It reminds me I'm not alone. This book is just so inspiring.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Unbelievable character and scene development.  You can see, feel and touch the scenes and characters.  Long book that goes unbelievably fast.  Worth the time investment.  Read book one of the series and cannot wait for book three.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Great read, long book which keeps your interest throughout.  Hard to put down.  Wonderful character and scene development.  Highly recommended.
B002GHIPYI|3.0|Pros:<br />Good sound quality if EQ'd right.<br />Build quality is pretty good<br /><br />Cons:<br />Very uncomfortable ear pads, can't use longer than 30 min max.
B006LSZECO|2.0|The book rambled, was repetitive, thin on characterization, keeps your interest in parts, but the ending ruined everything that came before it.
B007IXWL2C|2.0|Could have been written in 1 boo. If you like repetitious sex of all kinds, by all means read this book.  it added nothing to my life!!!
B007SGLZP8|3.0|The character development is short of what is needed, sloppy flow of travel and reasoning, not as well developed as I like, predictable in parts and in finish.  Not his best work.
B003XVYLDU|4.0|Read this for a book club. Found it to be very good and thought provoking. Looking forward to the book club meeting for an interesting discussion.
B0012GTZC0|3.0|Good read, descriptive but thin on major character development, not among his best works.  Interesting for a weekend, but if you are not into spy novels, move on.
B001AOKA3W|4.0|I really liked this movie. Although the idea of viewing everything through the viewfinder of a camcorder took a bit of getting used too, it added to the realizm. The action is a bit slow to get started but once it does (and it does quite abruptly and without warning) the rest of the movie is fast paced right to the end. The video and audio effects are great on blu-ray. If you like sci-fi thrillers where a huge creature wreaks havoc on a major city, you'll like this one. I took a chance on it and am glad I did.
B0067R0APK|1.0|Running on Galaxy S3. This app is clunky. I have to tap the widget multiple times before it opens. It does not keep very good track of my current location. The live background included on the phone and the lock screen provide more up to speed weather as the app is always delayed or waiting to refresh.
B005LAII12|1.0|This movie is a classic example of what makes &#34;old movies&#34; so popular today. To bill this as a &#34;must see movie of 2012&#34; is pure promotional hype and BS. It's not funny, crude for the sake of being crude is not comedy, it is just crude. Mark is capable of such great product, this is not that. I love good comedy, even raunchy comedy up to a point. Don't put this on if there are any<br />children present, as in the same neighborhood, even if those children are well over 21. Could not finish watching this. Worst part, it wasn't funny it was pathetic. Next to Killer Joe this is the worst movie since Machete.
B007PT1PEY|5.0|This was a $1 offering - what a great deal to be able to read the entire collection for this price
B002VQ7PVS|4.0|Book starts out on the fast track but then gets bogged down into details which delay the storytelling.<br /><br />a good book as to what went on in WW2 but it could be more abbreciated and get to the heart of the story
B005HSL626|4.0|Fun for the kids.  Easy to play and everyone loves to play no matter what the age.  One that we have kept around for awhile without getting bored with.
