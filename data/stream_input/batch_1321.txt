1451648537|1.0|An unnecessary biography of Steve Jobs. The whole book is liken to a poorly done collage of Jobs' stories, snippets that one can get from various sources e.g. Newsweek, Time, NYT and the likes. Extremely disappointed with the hype created around this book. The 45-minute Steve Jobs' amazing commencement speech for Standford in 2005 turned out to be more worthwhile than the days spent to flip through this book, an utter disrespect to Apple and Steve Jobs.

0307891402|5.0|This book is filled with so much information. Very detailed and colored. Comes with an awesome map. Also comes with online access code to the map. If you love the game. Chances are. You will love this collectors edition book.
B004P8JPS6|2.0|Souped up, testosterone driven main character came up short for me. Too much sex, too little suspense and wit for my taste. Character development consisted mostly of detailed descriptions of physical attributes. So glad I got this from the library and didn't spend any money on it.

1400052181|5.0|The story of Henrietta Lacks was very inspirational to me.  Her cells were harvested in 1951 and have been instrumental in developing the polio vaccine, cloning and gene mapping.  I had a stem cell transplant six years ago to cure my \\"stubborn\\" Hodgekin's Lymphoma and I think her unknown contribution helped to save my life, among many other lives!  Thank you Ms. Lacks!

B000Z27HLS|5.0|This is my favorite version of this wonderful story. It follows the books plot fairly closely and definitely gets the humor that Miss Austen put into the book.  There are some pretty terrible versions out there, but this is a very good one. Beautiful acting, sets and scenery. The suspense is well done as well. Love it!
B005K17RU0|5.0|love this app! works great on the kindle fire. It has plenty if options for viewing hourly, daily, or extended forecasts.
B0007OY2P8|2.0|I am a hard core Jane Austen fan, and love this book. This version of the movie is not good. It is very creepy, and not at all funny as the book is. The actors and sets leave a lot to be desired. It also skips over some key portions of the plot, apparently to make room for some of the dream sequences. The ending makes no sense at all.  Save yourself some time and money and check out the more recent version.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it rocks. it's awesome,  I mean who ever thaught you could play 101 games in one app or wat ever. it rocks... it's awesome it is cool.

B0062NAVXA|4.0|Courageous is a very solid attempt at bringing to light the often overlooked role a man pays as the spiritual leader of the family. In this time of absentee fathers, Courageous takes a stand and challenges men to step up to their responsibilities as husbands, fathers, and godly men. I hosted a special preview screening of this film before it was released, and it was hugely successful. The audience laughed, cried and cheered throughout the screening. It definitely touched a lot of lives that evening, and will no doubt continue to do so. The complaints I have deal with a sometimes amateurish production quality and some very contrived plot points and characterizations. The acting is clearly not Hollywood quality, though considering the actors are church members, and not true professionals, it is impressively done. If you are a Christian looking for meaningful entertainment for your family, you need look no further. Courageous will fit the bill nicely. Non-christians will undoubtedly have a more difficult time with this movie. But the film isn't geared to an amoral or atheistic audience. Courageous is a surprisingly well made movie with a clear Christian message. Just don't expect Hollywood quality acting or dialogue from this cast and you should come away impressed by this film.
B0062KMDZ2|5.0|First some back-information on the releases..<br /><br />Journey to the Center of the Earth has been released in at least 3 different Blu-Ray versions now:<br />Blu-Ray 2D (with 3D anaglyph (green/magenta glasses) + DVD + Digital Copy<br />Blu-Ray 2D + DVD + Digital Copy<br />Blu-Ray 3D + Blu-Ray 2D<br /><br />The original Blu-Ray 2D w/ Anaglyph 3D wasn't so great, mainly because the required green/magenta glasses which made the video look terrible (it also showed much more ghosting and the 3D was nice but hard to watch an entire movie). This release was later replaced with a 2D only release.<br /><br />The 2012 release is a REAL Blu-Ray 3D release (requires a 3DTV). The release is a single-disc with both Blu-Ray 2D and 3D versions on it (there is no Anaglyph version on here, so you will need a 3DTV to view it in 3D). It's also worth noting that there is no longer a DVD or Digital Copy included (There was, however, 8-dollars movie money for the 2nd movie coming out in early 2012).<br />The 3D Blu-Ray release includes a lenticular cover.<br /><br />MOVIE - I found the movie to be fun. Not a great movie by any means, but works nice as a \\"turn your brain off and just enjoy it without thinking too much about it\\" way. Nothing terribly memorable, but also more watchable than most of these movies (and I think a bit of that comes from the 3D - I originally watched it in 2D, but enjoyed it much more in 3D). At 92 minutes, it also doesn't drag on like some movies.<br /><br />AUDIO - This is an improvement over the original Blu-Ray releases which only had Dolby Digital 5.1 -- the 3D Blu-Ray now has DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 -- audio was very nice, didn't notice any issues with it.<br /><br />VIDEO - Video was also good - the colors seemed a bit odd at times, but still very watchable. An above average transfer.<br /><br />3D - Here's where the movie really shines. The Movie was filmed in 3D and combines live action and CGI elements very well. Lots of depth, lots of popout (a lot of gimmick popouts also, which I enjoy). I didn't notice ghosting/crosstalk during it (Panasonic DT30 LED TV with shutter glasses), something that is obvious during some movies. Depth seemed very natural and showed good separation.. sharpness was also very good. It was very obviously 3D the entire time, unlike some movies which seem as though 70% of them could easily be in 2D (and quite a few newer releases are just converted to 3D (this one was shot in 3D)). I'd rate it near the high end of 3D releases currently available.<br /><br />Extras - Extras are sort of thin (same as the original release) - biggest being the commentary. The 3D release also includes a lenticular slipcover.<br /><br />Overall - Not a great movie, but a fun movie. If you've seen it before and liked it, you'll like it much more in 'real 3D'. I owned the prior release (2D+Anaglyph+DVD+Digital Copy) and was still very happy with this new release.

B005XQLBU4|5.0|Great game.  it is a good way to spend a few minutes or a few hours if you have time to kill.

B0011HF6GE|5.0|This is my first Bon Iver CD and I might say that it is excellent. Its in my current play list and I can't stop listening to it. The standout cuts (for me) are Flume, Lump Sum, Skinny Love, Blindsided, For Emma, and Re_Stacks. Beautiful, haunting melodies throughout the whole album. I find myself listening to the words, music, pauses, and the whole ambiance. Quite stunning really. I usually cap off the day with a listen.

B0015AARJI|5.0|The item finally came after 16 days when it was ordered.  Pretty sad when I live only 2 1/2 hours from New York City.  Aside from the long wait; the product was excellent.  I received an authentic PS3 controller, not a cheap knock off.  It is working excellent.  Aside from the very long wait  am satisfied with the product.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|this app is nothing special. there are a lot of games. its like a cheap chinese knockoff of wario ware.
0812992792|5.0|I devoured this amazing novel. To be honest I am not sure if there is a darker place on earth than North Korea, yet the extremely talented (Dr.) Adam Johnson has made it a very human story. How can you achieve all that is important in living one's life if what precedes is nothing but trauma? The hero transcends his story of origin. I have been so impressed that both professional reviewers and people who just love to read all find this book riveting and amazing (with extremely rare exception). It is not possible to recount all the sensational adjectives ascribed both the the book and author. Words like \\"brilliant,\\" \\"breathtaking,\\"; the list goes on. Take a chance and immerse yourself in a place very few can go.

B0052VUNHC|5.0|I have read A LOT of novels (romance, especially) and I NEVER write reviews. This is my first, but I really felt that this story deserved some sort of accolade on my part. I won't go into details or highlights about the plot. I probably couldn't even if I tried because no one moment stood out to me - I LOVED and absorbed it all. Usually, when I read, I skip ahead if I get bored, to see if things will turn out as I had hoped & then backtrack.. but I couldn't in Beautiful Disaster. Every word was meaningful to the development & journey of the characters.. I stayed up all night reading it and have already encouraged all my friends to buy a copy. I'd loan it, but I want to read it over and over again. HIGHLY RECOMMEND BUYING THIS! It's become my all-time favorite - hands down in ANY genre.
1402760663|5.0|The book part alone is worth the money but the addition of photos, speaches, letters, etc.  Make this priceless.  There are only two maps and I wish they had included more.  It was sometimes hard to figure out where in today's bounderies various activities happened.  I've always had a fondness for our Native Amerians.  Reading this made me cry alot and feel shame for what was perpitrated by the greedy Europeans - and sadly continues today.  I think we should give all the national forestes to the Indian tribes.<br />I have purchased several copies of this as gifts and will probably buy more.

It has all kinds of reading plans to follow. Makes Bible Reading easy!

B0059XTUMC|5.0|I won't rehash the praise that other reviewers have given this movie; it's all true and then some. I loved the movie and found it poignant to the point of discomfort at times. It's a great movie and deserves all of the compliments heaped upon it.<br /><br />The only piece I wish to add is more praise for Uggi, the terrier that plays \\"Jack\\", the dog. His performance is an integral part of this film, and no, I'm not exaggerating for effect.<br /><br />Not to mention that he plays the type of stalwart, loyal companion that we all need in our life as we make our way through this world...
0062082353|1.0|I have yet to read the book but the book quality of the edges was very poor.  I was excited to order it after seeing many articles on this man but the quality of the materials in the book seem very sub par.  I hope the writing is better.

1580176941|5.0|I recently became interested in baking cookies for decorating.  I was inspired by a tv show that had gorgeous cookies decorated with royal icing.  I am so glad I bought this book.  I made the sugar cookies and followed the recipe and the hints for rolling out the dough and making the cutouts -- they tasted great, looked nice and didn't spread.  I also made royal icing with meringue powder and gel paste colors -- beautiful!  I think the photographs are very helpful and get the \\"creative juices\\" flowing.  I also like the decorating techniques explained.  I can't wait to make the chocolate cookies this weekend and work on more decorating skills.  I think this book has a lot to offer beginning and more advanced bakers.  This book will stay on my shelf for many years to come!
B005P06AAO|1.0|I don't know how its possible (since its sold by AMAZON EXPORT SALES) but i believe i got a fake copy.  First of all the cover of the disc is made of regular printing paper and authentic DVD's have a more plastic feel, and the printing is kind of low quality and the colors aren't vibrant as you see on the official poster.  Next when you open the cover you see 2 discs, both pink colored with a kindof blurry, low quality ink and the sticker on both discs are a millimeter displaced.  And last but not least, the mirrorside of the dvd's are purple colored and there are tiny little letters on the dark circle (the most inner circle on the mirrorside) with strange codes and the word 'DOWNLOAD'.  It's a great show and i love to watch it, but if you are an foreign customer like me you shouldn't buy a copy from a different region uless you have a computer or dvdplayer with no region restriction on it. I had to change manually the region of my tv to '0' and my macbook pro is protected against region-changes, so it's a struggle to whatch it!  I am very very dissapointed in Amazon.com for the first time, because i paid almost 50$ to ship it really fast and it feels terrible i got a fake copy!

My hat is off to Chief Kyle, well done!  Mick Hager  Author of Monkey Business, 7 Laws of the Jungle for Becoming Best of the Bunch.
030788743X|5.0|This is by far one of the best books I've read in a really long time. I devoured it in 36 hours. I've never written an Amazon review before but I felt compelled that this book deserved one. I was only 4 when the 80's ended so a lot of the pop culture references didn't resonate with me like I'm sure they did for those who grew up in that time period. However, I'm a pop culture nerd so I did recognize a fair share of the reference. Even if you're not a total geek like me, if you like sci-fi/distopian fiction, this is the book for you. Read it immediately.
B004A8ZWWE|3.0|\\"Real Steel\\" is set in the near future.  Life is pretty much as it is today, with one major exception:  a new sport of robot boxing has emerged.  Charlie Kenton (Hugh Jackman), a former boxer down on his luck, scrapes together a living by tinkering with junked robots and fighting them against bulls at rodeos and county fairs.  Hardly a model of integrity and honesty, he takes bets he can't cover and hightails it out of town when he loses.  Charlie owes money to everyone.  Charlie abandoned his son Max at birth.  Now 11, Max (Dakota Goyo) has just lost his mother.  Charlie allows the boy's aunt (Hope Davis) and her wealthy husband (James Rebhorn) to raise Max and agrees -- for a hefty fee --  to look after the boy for the summer while they vacation in Europe.  The movie combines the story of an absentee father reconnecting to his son and a \\"Rocky\\"-like feel-good movie but with robots slugging it out in the ring.  The problem is that it's tough to identify with or root for a metallic entity.  When two human fighters are going at it, we see the struggle, the pain, the bursts of energy, and the will to win.  With robots, however, special effects steal the story.  Still, Jackman is great to watch as he ably conveys contempt, anger, frustration, compassion.  His tremendous charisma elevates this action drama several notches.  The three-disc Blu-ray/DVD/Digital Copy edition includes four featurettes, deleted and extended scenes, and bloopers. The movie is also available in two-disc Blu-ray and single-disc DVD editions.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|ok fun ummm...... its a good time waster way to many adds though but i like it kinda not really but still so yeah
B004JZBGWI|4.0|I love the format, the feature that allows you to pin to do lists and notes to the task bar ( works well on kindle fire, which does not have widgets.)  Everything is cool. I would like it to sync with all major services, like dropbox, but maybe they are sponsored by the cloud service they recommend.

B005TBN3EU|1.0|There was little doubt that there would be a sequel to the hit 2009 comedy about a group of friends trying to put together the pieces of an alcohol soaked night in Las Vegas. Hollywood is first and foremost a business and no one is going to pass up the opportunity to squeeze more money out of a popular commodity. What's so frustrating about The Hangover Part II is the complete lack of anything resembling creativity or originality on the part of everyone involved. This movie is one of the most blatant examples of \\"phoning it in\\" that I have ever seen.<br /><br />The plot is an exact replica of the first film. Once again the wolf pack (Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms and Zach Galafranakas) find themselves hung-over after a wild night of partying (this time in Thailand) and working to figure out what happened. I could spend more time discussing the plot, but if you've seen the first film, then you've seen this one. The jokes are essentially the same, but the laughs are few and far between. The movie does seem to be striving to be cruder than the first, but it falls flat in that respect as well. Even the cast doesn't seem to be having as much fun this time around.<br /><br />If you saw the first movie, skip this one since it is merely a faded copy of the much funnier original. If you haven't seen it then watch it and forget about this lame excuse to cash in at the box office. The Hangover was fun but the party is over and it's time to move on.

B004VQK9XW|2.0|Watching my cat hunched over producing a steaming pile is more interesting than this album.  A few good songs but that's it.  Should I by the heroin diaries?

B000002GKT|5.0|English rockers Humble Pie released its fifth album Performance : Rockin' the Fillmore in November of 1971.<br />By 1971, the band Humble Pie (which consisted of former Small Faces singer/guitarist (the sadly missed) Steve Marriott, former Herd lead guitarist Peter Frampton, former Spooky Tooth bass player (the also missed) Greg Ridley and drummer Jerry Shirley) had recorded four studio albums but they only hinted at the greatness this band would unleash (especially the underground classic Rock On) but were upstaging bands they were opening for like Grand Funk Railroad, Ten Years After and Lee Michaels with their high octane performances. With Humble Pie rocking concert halls, the band recorded the Rockin' the Fillmore album shortly after The Allman Brothers Band recorded its classic breakthrough Live at Fillmore East.<br />There was one true hard rock live album before Rockin' the Fillmore and that was The Who's Live at Leeds. Then when Rockin' the Fillmore hit, it paved the way for other classic hard rock live albums like Deep Purple's Made in Japan and KISS' Alive (which wasn't the first hard rock double live album much to Gene Simmons' greedy chagrin) as I found out when I bought the CD in August of 2000 on a whim along with Thin Lizzy's Live and Dangerous.<br />We open with the great rocking \\"Four Day Creep\\" which is an old blues number rocked up in Humble Pie fashion. Then Marriott proved why he was one of the greatest rock singers with his acapella bluesy/gospel vocal counterpointing Frampton's lightning guitar riffs on the intro to \\"I'm Ready\\". This reworking of the Willie Dixon classic is arguably better than anything Zeppelin was recording. Then the only Humble Pie original on the whole album is the track \\"Stone Cold Fever\\" from Rock On and is superior to the studio version.<br />Then Side Two of the original album is taken up by a 23 and a half minute reading of the Dr John track \\"I Walk on Gilded Splinters\\" which rocks. The song starts as a slow blues then picks up steam during Peter Frampton's guitar solo and then gives way into a stellar harmonica solo by Marriott (who finally gets inducted into The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame this year (though it's for his years with The Small Faces)) then into another stellar solo from Frampton.<br />Side Three of the original album is taken up by the band's revved up 16 plus minute rendition of \\"Rolling Stone\\" (which is not neither an ode to the magazine nor the band nor is it a cover of Bob Dylan's \\"Like a Rolling Stone\\" but a cover of the late Muddy Waters' blues classic) and it just rocks (a studio version was on Rock On but this is the definitive version of the song).<br />Side Four of the original album starts with a rocking take of the late Ray Charles' \\"Halleujah (I Love Her So)\\" and just makes the song their own. We close the album with the show closer, \\"I Don't Need No Doctor\\" which was originally by the late Nick Ashford and Valerie Simpson but the band makes this song their own and would become a signature song for the band.<br />Sadly, this album would be the last with Peter Frampton who left the band during the mixing of the album in September of 1971 but we're left with a classic live album.<br />Performance : Rockin' the Fillmore reached #21 on the Billboard chart and gave the band its first Gold selling album within three months of its release. Forty years on, Rockin' the Fillmore is still a classic live album and showed us why Humble Pie and (in particular) Steve Marriott (who tragically died in a house fire while smoking in bed at the age of 44 in 1991) still sounds fresh today.<br />RECOMMENDED!m during Peter Frampton's guitar solo and then gives way into a stellar harmonica solo by Marriott (who finally gets inducted into The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame this year (though it's for his years with The Small Faces)) then into another stellar solo from Frampton.

0307716511|4.0|Straight-laced Beatrice has always been protective of her free-spirited younger sister, Tess.  When she gets a call that Tess has gone missing, she hops the first flight home to London from New York.  Alas, it's not long before Tess is discovered dead in Hyde Park.  Her death is ruled a suicide, but Bee knows her pregnant sister would not have taken her own life.<br /><br />Putting her own life on hold, Bee begins a frantic investigation into her sister's death.  Debut novelist Lupton does a fine job of salting the mystery with any number of suspects and/or red herrings.  As Bee becomes increasingly desperate, Lupton ratchets up the tension leading to an unexpected and notably interesting d&eacute;nouement.<br /><br />Clearly, I enjoyed reading this book.  It was well-written, smart, and psychologically astute.  My only real complaint is that I heard so much buzz about the title before sitting down to read it that it couldn't possibly live up to the hype.  I enjoyed this unusual thriller, but it didn't blow me away quite as thoroughly as it did others.
B003VS0CWY|3.0|This is a classic.  A movie I've seen a few times over. To watch it in Blu-ray was icing on the cake.  Amazon.com made the transition smooth in getting this movie from their place to mine.  No complaints.....At all!  Thanks again, Amazon!
0307891372|5.0|My friend was so excited to get this. This guide is so huge and the writing is tiny. They covered absolutley everything. And it comes with a map:) that was my favorite part! Haha
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is a great Bible app. I love being able to read the many translations. it also has audio. the Bible app has the ability to highlight phrases.
B003E6K1VK|5.0|I have some etymotic IEMs that are very sensitive, and plugging them into many audio sources results in a lot of hiss and flat bass response (caused by noisy amplifiers with high output impedance). With this DAC & headphone amp, I can't hear any hiss even with the volume turned up to ridiculous levels, and the bass response is perfect. I prefer clean, uncolored audio, and this amp sounds amazing good to me. It makes a ton of difference for some of my old CDs that were mastered at lower loudness levels.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Works very well. Moves with ease. Hours of fun. Great graphics. What more can I say. Worth the cost. Stellar gaming.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|what's sillier than throwing birds at pigs...not much...but that doesn't  mean it's not fun!  my husband (mr.\\"tablets & apps are a waste of time\\" is more addicted to angry birds then I am! ). and a bonus that it's free!  not sure why other reviewers have problems with not being able to play with no wi-fi...i played all weekend at my mother-in-laws and she DEFINITELY doesn't have anything but dial-up!!
B004X80QNG|3.0|All of a sudden, when in \\"week view\\" Monday goes across the entire top and every other day is just a square.  Is there any way to get it back so that all of the days (except Saturday and Sunday) are the same size, without Monday being twice as big as any other day?  Other than that I do like this app.
0061353248|5.0|I love this book. Finished it in a couple of days. Advised to all my friends and relatieves and everyone who read it liked the book too.  It's very easy to read (even if English is not your first language or you are not 100% fluent (like me :))).  I think no matter who you are a huge CEO, a housewife, a student or a teenager you'll find it very interesting and you'll learn something new.  I like how the author writes he's very easy going and you'll find many jokes in the text :)  I'm professor's Ariely new fan now :)  Looking forward to read all of his books now!
0062011847|5.0|IN Snuff, Terry Pratchett takes us back to Ankh-Morpork(at least for a short while), to watch as Sam Vimes is releived of all his duties. The job is Vimes foothold in reality and when he is forced out, even if it is so he can take a vacation, he doesn't like it. Terry Pratchett paints a wonderful world out in the country where somebody is always watching. When a crime is committed Vimes reacts as he always does and the chase is on. This is an excellent book and i would suggest if for anyone whether they are already a fan or not. Great Read!
0062082353|1.0|Boring, poorly written, and I love war novels too!  Although I'm not a  Jesse Ventura fan, I don't see Ventura as a liar and think this clown is more apt to lie for the press.  Poor form soldier.
0525478817|5.0|i knew i would cry when i read this. but i had no idea how loudly i would weep.<br /><br />john green is a rare and talented poet. he makes every word in this book matter. he has a way of explaining things using little words--but big imagery.<br /><br />reading this book, is like drinking a glass of champagne--a glass full of stars. my only warning, read it with a box of tissues.<br /><br />you will laugh. you will cry. then you will cry some more. and days later,  you may cry again.
B0063IH60K|5.0|standard, good ol' solitaire!  customizable options, good way to killtime!  unlike some games, you can change the screen orientation, which is nice.
B0061S073A|5.0|great they cant leave their area without the code &agrave;nd if something pops and they hit it they have to answer a question.  so it locks all kids thing in one area and u don't have to fight to use your apps.
B005URRCNQ|4.0|I received this album on vinyl which comes with 2 vinyls and a code for a digital copy. Shipping was great and the album was even better. This album is a lot more faster pace than the previous Black Keys album \\"Brothers\\" which in my opinion makes it better. It may not rival some of the Black Keys older albums such as \\"Rubber Factory\\" or \\"Magic Potion\\" but i think it is a solid album that has great songs in it.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|the upgrades come at good times. just enough to stay ahead of the onslaught! gets a little repetitious but in short bursts its fun
B00479SVBU|5.0|The device makes exactly what promises! I find sound quality VERY good, it's portable (to another car) and a wonderful and cheap solution for a car radio where the CD player is broken, as it was my case! But with the ADDED value of having all my songs stored in in a single place, no need to change the CD! Also, I live in a very hot place and CDs would damage with the heat. This way I preserve them at home. Super easy to configure, discreet (not so much eye catching for thieves)... I can only think of advantages!!!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I like this game. It is simple, but fun. I enjoy a game here and there through the day. Very glad I found it!

0439023521|5.0|****SPOILER WARNING****  I understand how hard these books are to digest. Yes, pitting teenagers to the death and expecting the victor to recover from the horrible two weeks of trauma in that arena is very upsetting (especially when a little twelve year old dies). But it is much like a soldier who comes back from war and is expected to live life normally again. It wouldn't surprise me that they would somehow gain a little bit of PTSD. If you interpret the books further and look past the blood, nudity, and deaths, it is actually a very compelling series about how corrupt human society has become. We (or they) think problems can be solved by law enforcement in the act of violence. The Hunger Games (from the glorified interviews to cold-blooded killings) is almost like a war in a way.  War is bad. There's nothing in the world (ex: ideas, point of views, censoring) that will completely hide the fact that it is bloody, horrific, and all-in-all negative. Positive outcomes or solutions may come out of it, but war in itself is, well, bad.  Yet how Suzanne Collins presents this futuristic situation is ingenious in a very upsetting manner. We all cringe whenever a tribute dies (either it's Cato or Glimmer... or Thresh and little Rue) because we think of how that person could have lived past their 18th year. How they never reached their 20s and were never able to live, have a family, and mature and grow old. And I believe that because she chose children to kill each other instead of adults, we notice how much more unjust the Capitol and President Snow really are. Someone with empathy and compassion for others would see how atrocious this is, yet someone as heartless and selfish as the Capitol people or President Snow would see only the pure entertainment and the vengeance they receive from it.  With all the injustices in these books, I noticed a positive theme that was floating around since the beginning page of the Hunger Games to the last page of Mockingjay: Hope. Hope for survival (and to keep the promise for Prim) was Katniss', and Peeta's, deep-down determination throughout the 74th Hunger Games, even though they kept denying they would win. Hope was evident in Catching Fire with Katniss talking with Thresh's and Rue's family. Also the pearl that was lovingly given to Katniss from Peeta was a symbol of hope for her, along with the dandelion flower. The whole reason for the war in Mockingjay was for the hope that future generations didn't have to live through what past ones did. And in the epilogue, Katniss thought of hope as she watched her children playing in the Meadow, for she knew they would have brighter futures than she ever had. Isn't that what parents strive for? For their kids to have better opportunities, better chances, better knowledge, so they could achieve the greatest?  Yes, the book may pose heart-wrenching themes, but there even throughout all these injustices, all these survivors can still hold on to hope and happiness, even when they've lost their right mind.  Many books I have read had characters put into very similar situations with deaths and wars, but I believe that the authors never truly understood how to apply those real-life reactions to their imagined characters. But with Suzanne Collins, she comprehends it and expresses it in a very powerful way in her novels. It even compelled me to sit and think about how unjust war and murders were.  I highly recommend this entire book series, not just The Hunger Games, for anyone who loves a good story with a deeper, much more psychological meaning in between the lines.
145162445X|5.0|Honestly folks, watch the lecture on 'youtube' (still titled 'Universe from Nothing')- and subsequently buy the book.  Krauss gives a fantastic description of normally esoteric scientific concepts.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This is a fun easy set of games. After working all day its nice to come home and relax with these games. I recommend this app.
B0036TGT3E|5.0|I bought this for a gift and it was a real hit.  I was lucky enough to get  to view this movie and though the movie itself is not my favorite the  quality of the blu-ray is very good especially on a high quality LCD TV.  Great picture and sound.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|LOVE IT!!! still working on the levels but overall very fun and worth the download. cant wait to get to the higher levels....
B006OT03BM|3.0|All this...but does it have digital copies of the movies?  If so this would be a perfect set...until number 4 comes out.
B006N0YWGY|5.0|I love this game, it's the best arcade style game I have on my kindle. Awesome graphics and super addicting. I definitely recommend it.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I use this to teach at church on my tablet. Very helpful. I have the entire family using this on their cell phones and tablets.
B00571F26Y|5.0|First, this is the most fascinating, informative, and convincing diet/health book I've read in recent years.  I won't get into an exhaustive discussion of content, as others have done that, but here's the book's thesis in a nutshell: Dr. Davis posits that wheat products are the single biggest cause of weight gain, body fat, and a host of other diseases including heart disease and diabetes, and backs it up with research and studies.  I can't believe I'm saying this about a health book, but this was actually a page turner - it's quite convincing and gripping.  This is one of those books where you will find yourself saying \\"wow\\" every five minutes.  Now, a few minor caveats.  First, while he mentions it briefly, Davis doesn't emphasize strongly enough that removing wheat must be combined with other dietary restrictions.  For example, you can't remove wheat, but then gorge on sodas, sugary snacks, and ice cream and expect to lose weight and be healthy.  Wheat is a certainly a major factor, but it's not the only piece of the puzzle.  Second, a valid argument could be made that this book is simply another tome advocating low carb eating.  However, Davis is more convincing and thorough in his argument than others I've read.  Third, removing wheat products from your diet is a JOB in my view.  It's everywhere - at the office, at parties, barbecues, etc.  A tremendous, almost inhuman amount of discipline is required in my humble opinion unless you're a total recluse.  Despite these minor negatives, the book is so well written and researched that I'm sticking with five stars.  Highly recommended for the health conscious reader.
032180354X|4.0|I initially followed Dustin's 365 project and have been looking forward to this book.  The first 20 pages consists of lighting essentials in order to get you up to speed ond on strobes, triggers, light modifiers and finally concluding with the inverse square law.  The remaining 100 pages show beautiful, nearly all low-key photographs, followed by the setup shot with very short descriptions of each flash setting as well as camera setting.  Compared with say, Joe McNally's books, whose prose is story-telling, putting you in the moment, \\"This is Strobist Info\\", is a essentially a picture book, void of sharing experiences, any planning or process. That being said, this style does offer the benefit of quick references. This was unexpected, and a little disappointing. But it still has some great photos, and is certainly worth the price. 3.5 stars.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game is awesome! I love gaining points and challenging my brothers to see who can get the best score! It's so addicting I could play for hours.

0061914177|1.0|I think Elisa 20 really nailed this book with her review; however, I want to add my two more cents to this deservedly despicable book.  I didn't know this Gary Vaynerchuk guy before I read the book and now that I've read it, I don't ever want to know him.  His writing here is mostly about himself, his accomplishments, his videos, his opinions and beliefs and his lies.  (Correction:  His TALKING here is mostly about himself, etcetera.  The book was dictated and then edited by an anonymous ghost editor.)  The author is quite the braggart and salesman, full of chutzpah and contradictions, a perfectly awful blend for me, but, then again, I have integrity and am old enough to know a snake-oil salesman when I hear and read him.<br /><br />The second thing you need to know about this book is that the first 40 pages of this 142-page sales tract is utterly worthless and irrelevant to the idea of trying to cash in on your passion.  The third thing you need to know is the author has just a few pages of real and practical advice, which are right in the middle pages of the book, the whole summary of which is found on page 136 -- exactly one page long.  All you have to do is go to GoDaddy.com and buy a user name; buy a designer's ability to create a web page; create a blog and distribute it through TubeMogul; use Viddler, Facebook, Ustream.tv, Ping.fm, Wordpress, Tumblr and Twitter to let everybody know your product and who you are.  Simple, right?  And if you don't have the Darwinian DNA to be the best and the strongest and the most talented -- like the author himself -- and don't want to brag how you are number one, like a drunken football fan about the 49ers, to the entire, unsuspecting and gullible world, like the author himself, then lay down and die.  You're not going to make it, sucka!<br /><br />Here's a Jewish guy being published by a Jewish publisher, both of whom are trying to get you to buy a book on \\"why now is the time to cash in on your passion,\\" which is the subtitle of this book.  Why now, you ask, dear reader?  Answer:  (1) Because it is.  (2)  Why not now?  The joke's on you.<br /><br />Tim Ferriss's name is splashed across the front cover of this book, another clue that this book, like the useless book by Tim Ferriss, is a con, just like his notion of a four-hour work week.tle of this book.

030788743X|5.0|Very good book. A total geek escapade that  is enjoyable and informative. The action and humor will have you reading this at all hours of the night. Highly recommended!
0312641893|4.0|Whew! What a fun, creative read! While the idea of fairytale re-tellings isn't new, and neither is the whole modernization with cyborgs in fairytale re-tellings, this was still much, much more creative than any other retelling I've ever read.<br /><br />While the concept for this book is what I'll remember most years from now, other aspects of this book will stick with me. First, I liked that it was set in future China, but was kind of sad that Meyer didn't add in more of the Asian customs except for the random detail mention of using chopsticks and a few other smaller details like that.<br /><br />Characters were very well developed, although I really wish Marissa Meyer had taken more time to develop the relationship with Cinder and her young step sister Peony more. That relationship felt rushed, and as a result I was not as invested in the heartbreak that comes later in the story revolving around that relationship.<br /><br />I liked Kai's character. I thought he was well written, although at times felt too mature for someone who was supposed to only be like 18. I know he's royalty and all, but 18 year old boys are all the same in certain aspects, royalty or not.<br /><br />My only major gripe with this book is that the \\"surprise\\" twist at the ending. I saw that coming about 60 pages in which made the big reveal less satisfying. I understand that this is written for a younger audience, but still. It was all too painfully obvious to me.<br /><br />That being said, even though this is a retelling I thought Meyer took it far enough in a different direction that I will no doubt continue with the story when the next book comes out.<br /><br />I also want to applaud Marissa Meyer for her pacing. Most YA books that are apart of a series are soooo slow until that last 100 pages or so. This book had great pacing right from the get go and I rarely found it to lose its momentum. So kudos to you Marissa!<br /><br />This was fun, quirky, funny, romantic and overall nicely well done. It IS a little overhyped - so another kudos to the marketing team's efforts, but it's definitely worth reading for any YA fan!am's efforts, but it's definitely worth reading for any YA fan!
0143038419|2.0|Really can anyone just move around on a whim like this broad? And whose paying for it? I was disappointed in the \\"flow\\" of this book and also how unlike my life it was. I was I guess hoping to be inspired. Instead I'll hope the movie is better,.. but I doubt it.
B004U52VPS|5.0|My second grader loves playing this game.  Not just knocking them down, but building them as well.  He likes to create his own and building it with as many parts and birds as he can.
B006GG1KOC|3.0|not bad to kill time but not enough levels. fun for children and adults. no penalties for guessing incorrectly. good to play once.

B005ZUR724|1.0|It looks promising, but the lack of real Kindle Fire support and ridiculous fees kill this game before it gets off the ground.<br /><br />Make it a real free to play or a PC counterpart to justify the pricing structure. Make updates release for all platforms simultaneously. Nobody should have to wait especially if they're paying for it.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|I didn't get the hype and had to see for myself. Physics are not applicable, some levels make me want to scream. So why do I find myself unable to put it down? The ads are usually not in the way. Easy enough to get around.
B004SBQAN8|5.0|The plot of this film seems to be loosely modeled on the short-lived 1980s TV show THE POWERS OF MATTHEW STARR.  Like Starr, the story centers around a teenage boy from another planet who has been sent to earth to be hidden-away from bad guys who invaded his home.  Ostensibly, the plan is to have him tucked away to refine his powers so that, when he's ready, he can return to the fight & lead his race to victory over the intruders.  Like STARR, he has a mentor who is tasked with showing him how to use his powers responsibly and effectively.  Also like the TV series, some of the intruders get tipped-off to where he is....and they're going to be looking for him.<br /><br />Unlike STARR, the main character in this movie is not the only adolescent whom his race has sequestered on Earth (hence the title of the movie).  He has peers stowed away, but the idea is to keep them seperate so that finding any one of them won't lead to the demise of them all.<br /><br />I found this to be a highly entertaining and fun movie.  The bad-guy aliens are far more menacing than ones from the 1980s TV show were, and the FX are way more spruced~up than STARR could ever dream.  If you're looking for a sci-fi film that's also family-friendly, then this one is highly recommended.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|I bought this as a Christmas gift for my youngest daughter who is 32.  We both enjoy watching the dvd's together.  She wanted the complete set. We were waiting for all the films to come out on dvd to buy them. Excellent quality and packaging.

1451627289|5.0|I haven't read every novel that King has written, but out of all the ones I have, I think this is his best by far.  The plot is intricate, the characters are ones we come to care a great deal about, and it's a page-turner in the best sense of the word.  It's ironic, but I think King's best work are those novels and stories where he dials down the supernatural and concentrates on the human condition.  He has obviously gotten better with age, and 11/22/63 is truly not to be missed, even by non-fans.  Very impressive.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|Doesn't get updated and is behind market version. Crashes Xoom.  Needs better support from EA. also not great graphics. and more words still required?
B002R5V7MG|3.0|Maestro Dudamel will give us a Mahler First worthy of his talent.  I didn't mind the slowness of the first movement so much, but the pulling about of the tempo at the start of the scherzo was just ugly.  Most disappointing, though, was the utter lack of Jewishness in the slow movement.  When I heard George Manahan conduct this work the trumpets wailed and wept so in the \\"Jewish wedding\\" episodes that I burst out laughing.  Here the trumpets are hardly audible, and these moments go for nothing.  Compare Bernstein (DG CD or video) or Horenstein here if you want to know how it should sound.  The bass solo at the start of this movement was \\"beautiful\\" rather than grotesque.  Overall this is a good performance, but it's a bit early in The Dude's career to consider this a final view.  I'm as enthusiastic about Dudamel's talent as anyone, but enthusiasm shouldn't develop into idolatry.  I found City Noir surprisingly interesting, considering how much I dislike most new music.  I also enjoyed the documentary, and I hope that the promise of Dudamel's relationship with the LAPO will be fulfilled.  Based on his work in Gothenburg, I expect nothing less.
B005Y423ZC|5.0|If you are an Adele fan you will love this concert.  She does all her best songs plus some great covers
B004LP3AYI|5.0|I really love the book. It's just as good as the first one. It would be well written if it weren't riddled with spelling errors and missing words. Each Kindle \\"page\\" has at least 2 errors on it. Unbelievable! If anyone knows how to email the Kindle publisher I would be grateful.
0545265355|5.0|I was given this trilogy as a gift and didn't know what to expect. As soon as I started reading it, I was a goner. I didn't eat, didn't sleep, I had to get to the end of it. Hat's off! The games concept is brilliant, the society so familiar (Lady Gaga's green/blue hair), the characters lovable. The love triangle added constant internal battle, am I for Peeta or for Gale, and I think I made a final decision just about the same time that Katniss did. Can't wait to see what will be next in Suzanne's book kitchen ;).

B00275EGWY|2.0|Ok, I didn't understand how everything went down at the Academy Awards honoring the best of 2009. The Hurt Locker winning awards for best director and picture over Avatar, especially when the winning movie came out in 2008(HELLO!)! It kinda has me thinking that someone who became a fanatic of this movie completely bribed the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for The Hurt Locker to gain an extra chance at Academy Awards when that person became a sore loser that Slumdog Millionaire(won best director and picture 2008) took everything from this movie.  As for the movie, I do give director Kathryn Bigelow points for trying to go for realistic in this war. This kinda stuff I can assume did happen in the Iraqi war, but the movie itself is just far from great and not even close to good. The protaganist that is played by Jeremy Renner doesn't do too bad as the risk-taking bomb disarmer who treats bombs as video games, but he should've been given more than what was given to him to do.  As much as I appreciate that this piece borrows some music from rock band Ministry, it still doesn't make things better than the fact that this movie is just another overrated, overhyped, steaming pile of crap. I do wanna watch the Academy Awards honoring the best of 2011, but i can't help thinking someone could bribe the Academy into giving some random movie from a year ago the Awards.
0553801473|3.0|If you expect action and hope that the story will move along a bit, you will be disappointed. Not much happens. But the description and intrigue is rich and well worth the read. I would have felt better about reading this book if I knew that the author was hard at work on the next volume. Unfortunately George is still on the book tour circuit as of January 2012, with no obvious intent to ever finish this series. Whether he will need a ghost writer to finish it for him remains to be seen. I hope he has plotted it out to grease the chute for his replacement.

Contagion is not that either.<br /><br />Looking for CSI: Virus Outbreak? Contagion is that. Contagion is packed with stars who play very relatively small parts and take a back seat to Laurence Fishburne who essentially takes his old CSI: Las Vegas character and applies it to this movie. And the movie is mostly about finding out where the disease came from and finding a vaccination/cure. The acting is all done well, and Director Steven Soderbergh creates some realistic and genuinely unsettling moments in the movie. Man, if you weren't a [[ASIN:B002XIXJOG Purell]] user prior to seeing this you will be after!<br /><br />So what's scarier and more enjoyable to watch?...The realistic depiction of a virus mutating and potentially dooming civilization as we know it or the notion of, I don't know, say some unknown outbreak causing people to mutate dooming civilization as we know it? Give me Zack Snyder's [[ASIN:B001CW7ZW6 Dawn of the Dead]] any day! Alas, Zack was too busy for Contagion working on some little project about a dude from Krypton.<br /><br />Look, I'm not saying don't check out Contagion. You should. It's good. I was entertained. For me, however, Contagion was more of an interesting take on a virus outbreak from introduction to solution versus great, exciting movie making.<br /><br />Ahhhhchooo!

0525478817|5.0|When I first read the reviews on this book, I was expecting a lot. After my final exams, I pulled out the book, and read it cover to cover in a day. By the end, I had laughed our loud, and then cried. The characters seem so real--it's like they're your friend too. This book makes you appreciate every day as you live it. It is one of my all time favorite books.

0810988232|5.0|I've been a huge fan of Brian and Wendy Froud for about as long as I can remember, from the days of The Dark Crystal and Labyrinth.  I've owned several of their books, and The Faerie's Oracle deck.  Now, I'm loving The Heart of Faerie Oracle as much, or more.  The artwork is beautiful, and the meanings of the cards touch the soul in the most incredible way.  I've been using Tarot cards and other forms of divination for about 20 years now, and none have ever flowed so easily as this deck.  No doubt about it, the Frouds have succeeded in bringing the world of Faerie into our own world, once again.

B0034G4P80|4.0|Thor the Norse god Thunder is banished from Asgard to earth for his arrogant and intolerable behavior.  His actions have restarted an ancient war but he is not the problem, it is the evil Loki the god of mischievous deeds and evil who is the real culprit.  While Thor (Chris Hemsworth) tries to live among humans he befriends Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) a mortal human and is forced to defend Earth as Loki's evil forces invade as part of the plan.<br /><br />This movie is an excellent story from the comics of Marvel and brings to life the ancient god and hero as he renews his power and glory to be restored among the most noble of Asgard.  Thor must face his past faults and become a true hero if he is to successfully regain his place.<br /><br />The special effects and battle scenes are wonderfully done and the ice monsters are scary and help to make the evil doers seem to be a powerful and evil opponent.  This is not the strongest movie of the comic book genre but it is an entertaining and fast paced action movie.<br /><br />Loki (Tom Hiddleston) gives a strong performance and helps make the movie more interesting and provides an evil doer who tries to gain control of Asgard.  I enjoyed this movie and I believe you will too!

B003Q6D25K|5.0|Paranormal Activity 2 is the sequel with really no improvements whatsoever.  However because I love the series, I can't help but give it a perfect 5-star rating anyway.  I honestly, truly believe anyone who's a fan of the Amityville Horror (the original one) will LOVE the Paranormal Activity series.  Alright, so Paranormal Activity doesn't necessarily wrap a storyline around these paranormal events, but then again, it's not really supposed to-  it's all about building horror and finding the creepiest ways imaginable to get underneath the sensitive side of the viewers.  So why isn't the sequel better than the first one?  Well a couple reasons.  Now we have children.  Two children- one a teenage girl; the other a baby who spends most of his time in a crib.  We also have a German Shepherd always on alert.  PLUS the parents and the wifes sister.  Yes, with all these people involved, you can't possibly have a movie deliver with the suspense in the same way as the first one.  The simplicity of the setting and including only two people (a young couple) makes the first one much scarier.  Also, another reason it's not as scary- the camera angles.  Whereas on the first Paranormal Activity the camera is mainly locked into one specific spot in the bedroom where the man and woman sleep, now the camera has a few other permanent positions, such as the baby's room above the crib, the living room/kitchen area, the swimming pool outback, and the hallway near the front door.  This means whenever the tension is about to build, the cameras alternate between all four of these areas.  I prefer the way it was done in the original.  That way we'd learn to appreciate and grow accustomed to the setting and the frightening scenes as our eyes absorbed into the darkness of the bedroom waiting anxiously for the next horrific scene.  With a camera switching between four different areas of the house, now there's not as much build-up in the suspense.  On a similar note, it's amazing how brilliant the horror aspect works in a movie like this.  It's so simple and yet, a genius idea!  You learn to understand how the camera system works- when everything gets quiet and we return to a familiar camera position, you *know* something scary is about to happen, but there's never any telling what the actual scary moment will BE.  It could be anything!  There's literally hundreds of ideas the movie writers could have implemented.  I love it!  Actually a third reason this isn't as scary as the first one is because now we know what to expect.  Honestly the movie writers should have kept this in mind because the first 3 or 4 paranormal scenes are VERY predictable and remarkably tame in comparison to even the mildest ones from the first Paranormal Activity film.  I don't want to spoil what they actually are in case you haven't seen them yet, so just know the BIG shocks won't appear until later.  Oh well- at least the movie doesn't take a while to get going this time around- you only have to wait 15 minutes until something unusual happens, whereas in the first one you had to wait 30 minutes.  Now onto the positives-  I have both Paranormal Activity 1 and 2 on DVD, and part two has *drastically* louder and better sound overall.  Honestly the first one is quite mild in the sound category, so you have to make constant adjustments on your volume button.  With part one, I recommend just turning it up louder than you normally would and leave it be.  With part two... you should probably turn the volume down a few notches.  With naturally louder volume, when the unexpected horror segments arrive, get ready to be REALLY scared!  I mean downright shocked!  I love it!  Overall however, the amount of terrifying segments just aren't as numerous as in the first film.  Plus it seems like, with the parents, there's a \\"been there, done that\\" feeling for those of us who've watched the first Paranormal Activity movie (especially with the wife and how the evil lurking in the house takes over her mind and body).  I'm not particularly fond of the setting- San Diego once AGAIN!  Let me share the same sentiments again (in case you haven't seen my review for the first Paranormal Activity that I submitted a couple weeks ago).  San Diego is the wrong location for a horror setting.  It's too mild there.  A much better place would be the northeast, especially anywhere from Massachusetts down to Georgia.  Overall, expect a fantastic horror movie, but don't be surprised if it doesn't live up to your expectations, and definitely don't be surprised if it doesn't live up to the superior part one.

B005MYEQ4U|5.0|This movie is refreshing.  Many of Allen's recent films have been loaded with his adolescent sexual fantasies - and it is nice to have him return to what he does best, neurotic comedy.  The casting was perfect- Owen Wilson skillfully embodies his character.  I couldn't think of a better person to fill the role.  While those familiar with the literary greats he encounters will appreciate this best, finally there is a Woody Allen movie that all ages can appreciate.
B003BKF696|5.0|High Violet is atmospheric and beautiful in a sad way.  I've been listening to it heavily for over a year, and I still love it.  This works as an entire album.  Now that music is portioned out in digital pieces, it is rare for me to find a complete album that I enjoy.  I bought the full album digitally over time, but I wish I'd just purchased High Violet on CD at once.  I wasn't familiar with The National before I got this, but I was able to appreciate it.

1936850028|4.0|First let me freely admit I hate the cold.  I don't ski.  But I understand passion and Birkie Fever is about passion:  the passion of the human to beat the elements, to beat one another, to excel.  And I understand excellence.  The author's love for this sport and its history imbues the book with drive and fervor; his search for excellence in his chosen endeavor becomes ours.  The story is one I never would have guessed; perhaps never would have encountered but for the author's commitment to his sport.  Read Birkie Fever and have a glimpse into a world where the worst of elements can be overcome by the human spirit -- if you're good enough; if you care enough; if you try hard enough, long enough.  So in a way this book is a mirror held up to each of us, reminding us that heroism can be local, and victory must be personal.  Feel the cold, the effort, the commitment, and rejoice:  overcoming the elements is what humans do best.  Thank you, Walter, for guiding us through this very different world that many, without this book, would never know.

B005URRCUY|5.0|I'v listened to every Black Keys album so far and have loved every minute of every one of them. They seem to be some of the few artists out there where it's obvious that they make music for the simple enjoyment of it and haven't gotten caught up in everything else fame and fortune has to offer after 10 years of playing.  That said, in regards to the Black Keys fans who don't like all of the Black Keys' albums: The BK don't make their albums the same way that most artists do. Most artists are in a constant process of song writing/performing, where they'll write a song, shelve it, and pull it out for their next album or wait for the right album to put it on. The Black Keys make their albums in a time span of about a week, writing and playing songs for the first few days, then selecting the tracks with the most potential before editing the songs and ordering them on a CD. This means that each album has no forethought or planning, making each release a snapshot of the band in time, and each album having a tone and mood very different from the next.  So, for those of you that don't like this album and are asking the Black Keys to return to their roots, I say \\"not gonna happen.\\" This is what makes the Black Keys special. Besides, the sound that this band has isn't what makes them great, it's Dan Auerbach's super-creative and resonant guitar riffs and lyrical genius and Patrick Carney's aggressive and soulful drum-beating, which as far as I'm concerned has been prevalent in every BK release to date. El Camino is no exception, with a groovy 60's vibe coupled with Dan and Pat's aforementioned skills, this CD does not disappoint and has stayed in my CD player since I bought it 2 months ago.

If you read this and are not moved, check your pulse to see if your still alive.
0439023491|5.0|This book was an exciting, action-packed sequal to the spetacular Hunger Games. The reader sees Peeta\\"s and Katniss's relationship grow. Who should Katniss pick, Gale or Peeta? Read the thrilling sequal and make your own choice. Peeta's character develops even more and he almost seems too good to be real. The fast past ending will leave you hungry for more with more twist than I can count. New interesting characters are introduced as well. If you like action, romacnce, and a fast paced read than you will love the second Hunger Games book, Catching Fire. This book is not gender based and most will love this book. I hope you love Catching Fire because I know I sure did.
B00006LIRI|5.0|This greatest hits collection has the most recognizable hits from their legendary albums, Achtung Baby!, Zooropia, Lemon, and All That You Can't Leave Behind. Even Better Than The Real Thing, is an adventurous journey through the space-time continuum that features a kick ass video and is a great way to start off the album. Mysterious Ways is one of U2's most well-known tracks with good rhythm sounds from Larry Mullen Jr.(drums), and Adam Clayton(bass). Beutiful Day is U2's come back hit, upbeat, driving beat, and great video, U2 originally said that All You Can't Leave Behind was a make or break album that marked the 20th anniversary of U2,as well as a turning point of the bands future, Bono was very retrospective in his comments on the band's future, which was obviously in question during the albums recording. Electrical Storm has a particularly modern sound to it and also great effects if you have a top-notch audio system. One is undoubtedly the most well-known U2 track about love, Bono and The Edge(guitar, real name Chris Evans), have powerful and emotional lyrics, so much so that Guns & Roses W. Axl Rose, a self-proclaimed tuff guy, said that the song made him weep. Stay( Faraway, so close) is one of my personal favorites, Bono's astute and erudite lyrics echo Biblical themes and wisdom. Listen carefully to Bono's lyrics they are a jounrney into human feeling and emotions we can all relate to, he should have won a Grammy for this track. Stuck In A Moment You Can't Get Out Of, was another huge hit off Behind, good video and restrospective song. Until The End Of The World, a song about the prototypical introvert, lacking confidence, and never being spontaneous. Discotheque, is a great dance song and upbeat track, cockney rhyming rap on this one. Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me, Kill Me, the soundtrack to Val Kilmer's Batman, no suprizes here, just a great track. Numb, is by far the most Avant Garde track in U2's catalogue, hey The Edge gets tormented by various female body parts and Bono singing in his face, best video ever! This album is a must have for all U2 fans and hard rock fans alike!body parts and Bono singing in his face, best video ever! This album is a must have for all U2 fans and hard rock fans alike!

B005WM6RUS|5.0|The book Sarah's Key takes place in the past and present day of Paris, France.  The book has two main characters.  The first character is a little Jewish girl Sarah Starzendki.  She lived in France and was placed in the Vel de Heve round up during the time of the Holocaust.  The second character is an American journalist, Julia Jormand that lived in France for twenty-five years.  Julia has become so obsessed with the little girl Sarah and her struggles throughout her life.  The book Sarah's Key's setting is Paris France in 1940's The book has an \\"on and off\\" switch of time.  The two main characters Julia Jormand and Sarah Starzenski are linked between past and present Paris, France.  Julia was assigned a job to write an article about the Vel de Heve.  She then stumbled upon Sarah and began looking into her life story.  The book slowly starts to put together the pieces of events, showing the connection that both Sarah and Julia share.  Sarah's Key touches my heart with its disheartening story.  Sarah's Key is a mind-blowing book that tugs on your emotions throughout many events in the book.  In my opinion, the book Sarah's Key is an amazing book that teaches you a lot about many things.  If I were to judge this book I would give it five stars because of how the book keeps me wanting to read more every time I stopped.  I felt so attached to the characters, Julia and Sarah.  I really felt like I was there during their situation in the story.  Overall, Sarah's Key is an amazingly wonderful book.

I recommended this to anyone that likes good books.

While the quality of the type is decent, the quality of the illustrations - the primary reason one orders a damn drawing book in the first place - is completely unacceptable. It looks like a book of connect-the-dots pictures; I am unable to make out, much less learn from, Bridgman's work. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER.

The Murder of Roger Ackroyd is up there with Murder on the Orient Express with it's unique plot, red herrings, characters, and the amazing ending.  The plot revolves around a suicide of an older woman and the murder of a man by the name of Roger Ackroyd. It is told from the perspective of Dr. Shepperd, the town doctor. The ending of The Murder of Roger Ackroyd is one-of-a-kind. The culprit was a complete surprise to me. The answer was there all along, so obvious, and yet so concealed. A great mystery overall.

B001JNNE64|1.0|As others have said, the added footage ruins this movie. I have always considered the theatrical release one of the best movies ever. This version changes the movie entirely. Salieri goes from being a sympathetic character who speaks for 'mediocrity' to a horrible person that is no different from the typical bad guy in most dramas. The uniqueness, comedy, and enjoyment of the movie is ruined. I would definitely wait until the theatrical release is out on blu-ray. Up converted DVD is just find for this movie, and the theatrical release is available on dvd.

B004EPYZU8|5.0|Awesome, I mean awesome, all you need to know is that it features superhot chicks shooting stuff to kick-ass music. I believe there is a plot or something but you really don't want to immerse yourself in these trivialities. Why? Because you will ruin it for yourself. The set pieces involving the 3 giant Chinese guys, the WW1 battlefield, the B24 and the castle, and the Huey and the future train are magic and justufy the cost of the film itself. In fact I dont bother to watch the rest of it at all. Its like a big old lovely groovy pop video, or infact what Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow could have been, if it wasnt a load of old carp.  My only man is that there aren't more chicks, more guns, more planes and more music. The girls are all lovely, and I cannot, cannot for the life of me understand how this film got certified a 12.  Good heavens. And not only are the girls lovely, their basic firearms skills and CQB skills are actually not bad, not bad at all.  My only other moan apart from my previous moan, or sub set of moans, is that my TV isnt bigger, and noisier.  Sucker Punch ROOOOOOOOOLLLLLLSSSSS.  PS - I'm 43 and a High Court Judge.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I thought 11/22/63 was an awesome book, I couldn't put it down, I would easily give this book between 4 1/2 - 5 stars,  I've been reading Stephen King's books for about the past 20 years, and I have to admit he would be by far, the greatest horror writer alive, he constantly keeps the audience on the edge of their seats, and that's the main reason I love reading his books, I would be surprised if he ever wrote non-fiction, but I would still read it, If you're a King reader I would STRONGLY suggest you buy 11/22/63, you will not be disappointed.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I use this every morning for the weather. Can not go a day without it. the controls are very comfortable to use and the setup is great.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is so much fun, lots to do and very challenging things to do. I could do without the pop ups but......what ya gonna do
0307946711|3.0|This is a book for chicks, and blokes whoo have had soulmate type breakups. I was recommended this by a friend of mine who fell into the second category, he thought the book was about him. It sort of was, in that Emma was just like his Emma, anyway, I digress. If you like diary type stuff like Bridget Jones, this will be right up your alley. My alley is full of wheely bins and bikes, and thats how I like it!!
B0063IH60K|4.0|I enjoy this version of solitaire better than others I've tried. Only once has there been any glitches that caused the game to freak out. I just uninstalled it and reinstalled it a week later. The buggieness was gone and I'm happily playing the game again!
B005MYEPXC|5.0|Woody Allen has obviously matured and learned to pull himself to center between his extremes in the past with this one.  His Golden Globe for best screenplay was well deserved.  This film was recommended to me by several people who, like me, had reservations about \\"another Woody Allen movie,\\" but were all delightfully surprised.  I was not disappointed either.  Woody's portrayal of human angst was again evident, but employed in a more sophisticated manner so as to elicit joy and hope rather than cynicism.  Owen Wilson surprised me as well with a much more sincere performance than usual.  Under Allen's direction, Wilson boyishness and bent for comedy were tamed and honed to bring richness to his character rather than silliness.  In short, this was one of the most all around satisfying movies I've seen in a long time.  It left me uplifted to feel that the cinema might again renew my faith in their ability to bring clean, honest, positive and thoughtful entertainment back to the screen.  I was left, as a viewer, with a sense of having been transported to somewhere quite magical that I hope to again revisit. Definitely five stars.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Great.  Appreciate all the info and international access.  Let it snow, at least I'll know to grab the mittens and coffee on the way out.

0312641893|4.0|I thought Cinder was a wonderful book. Most YA books are about paranormal things, such as werewolves and vampires. This was a refreshing change of pace from the normal YA novels. Cinder is about a cyborg who falls in love with a prince, but can't be with him. It was a great retelling of Cinderella for a new generation. The characters were very well written. Prince Kai was a bit whiny, but it didn't get annoying like most whiny characters do. Cinder is a strong, and smart character. I like that she was willing to sacrifice her well being for the good of her people to find a cure for the plague. The story was a little predictable. At the middle of the book, I was almost certain I knew what was going to happen at the end, and I was right. I recommend Cinder to anyone looking for something good to read. I can't wait for the second book in The Lunar Chronicles to come out.
B0000C03AH|5.0|These performances have been in my music library since I first received the vinyl Beethoven Edition package for Christmas in 1970.  I also have the digital Beethoven Edition CD, so I know the recordings well.<br /><br />As excellent as all of those predecessors are, this release blows me away.  Listening to the Ninth, I hear a clarity and spacial distinctiveness that I have never heard before.  It's so beautiful, it brought tears to my eyes.<br /><br />Note:  I don't even own an SACD player (yet).  I have as yet only heard the CD tracks.  I should have bought this years ago.
B0045I6X90|5.0|Arrived quickly and it was in good working order. This is an awesome soundtrack and would recommend the soundtrack & movie to all!
0307595579|5.0|Very much enjoyed ready this trilogy, would like to read the other books that were ready to go to print before his death, very fast delivery of the series of books..
B0054JZC6E|4.0|A lot of variety. The unlockable games give 101 replay value. Some games are better than others, but you're never forced to play any of them.
B005VR92LU|5.0|great album of rock-a-billy / jazz / swings with a great irish voice and really foogs musicians!!!!!!!  but i'm so bad in english for say more
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Couldn't ask for more.  By far the best study bible out there.  The reading plans are easy to setup and follow.  U can setup reminders.  Truly a God send.  And it's FREE!!!
0399243860|5.0|We liked the book as a teaching tool.  We haven't had a chance to work with him on it yet so I can't tell you how he likes it.
0385535139|2.0|I was able to borrow this from my local library because I certainly wouldn't have purchased it - I'll wait for the movie with Matt Damon.  As has happened with most best selling mega-royalty authors who've had movies made of their books, they are now writing book for movies, period.  This is only one of 20 authors I've followed for years and rarely read their new releases because the movie might actually be more entertaining.  You can scan through 50% of this book and not miss a thing.  Even the ending was sadly predictable by page 50.
B006FTCH2E|2.0|I loved the idea of this movie but the plot just went on way too long.  Not much for main character development.  Not a movie I would recommend to anyone.  Quality not as bad as I expected but not enough story here to keep my interest.  After paying to see it I stuck it out to the bitter end.  Hindsight would suggest it was a waste of my time.
B006JPS1OM|1.0|I have been trying to down load for 2 days. I would love to play and possibly would would purchase, but I am not wasting my time anymore.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Simple, but challenging version of Missile Command. Would like to see more variety in the higher levels. Also more tools in the defensive arsenal would be nice.
B005I6EVUG|5.0|Bought this for my wife hoping she would like it, she LOVES it.  Very stylish and the leather looks and feels of high quality.  In looking at other cases this is more than worth the price.
0060987464|5.0|I received this book for Christmas and got around to reading it on the 31st of December.  I couldn't put it down.  I finished it on the 5th of January which is remarkable for me because I'm a rather slow reader.  I really enjoyed the whole thing and recommend everyone (fan or not) to read it just to get a feel for what Marilyn Manson has been through.
B005XQLBU4|1.0|Seriousley worst game ive ever played. my friends agree. I don't understand all the great reviews this game is awful! you run out of missiles so easily and u cant do anything about it just...ughh its not good at all. if I could rate 0 stars I would. THUMBS DOWN :P
B004FOA84A|3.0|I enjoyed playing this, and had a hard time putting it down.  It reminded me a lot of older point and click adventure mystery games, which I used to love.  That being said, it was way too short and most of the solutions were way too easy.  The ending was pretty weak, too.  Overall, I'd say the game is just a fun distraction for an hour or two.  If you decide to buy this, I would recommend buying it through the Corona Indie Bundle, which is 5 games in 1 for the exact same price (as of this writing, 99 cents).
B004EPYZZ8|5.0|Great true story of courage and faith. This young lady is one of heavens heroes. Gives real perspective to lifes every day problems.
B004O3YGMC|1.0|I got the app when it was free so I decided to give it a world. When I went to the developer's website to download the Mac version companion app I was asked to pay 19.99 for the desktop app. What a freaking joke. Good thing I didn't pay for this app in the first place.
B005M5OSBK|2.0|This Pink Martini album continues the tradition of eclecticism that Pink Martini seems to build on. It contains pieces from various styles, including salsa, bossa nova, classical jazz, modern jazz, musical, and some just plain odd songs that just don't fit anywhere in terms of style; the pieces are sung in English, Italian, Spanish, French, and Japanese. I would characterize this album as follows: most songs taken individually are enjoyable well done, with China Forbes's vocals really admirable, but the way these styles are intermixed and left in a random way definitely speaks to a lack of artistic vision. One can, and should, use style heterogeneity as a means of artistic expression, but in Pink Martini's case this mish-mash seems much more like a feeble excuse for an inability to find the band's own identity. Contributing to this impression are several songs which cannot be described otherwise than eerie (\\"Que serra serra\\", \\"Moon, river...\\") and, speaking plainly, act just as filler and are disappointing to the listener. It would have been much nicer, for example, if they had organized the CD as a \\"trip\\" from one style to another, say starting with latino, moving on to Italian, and finishing with the air of a French music-hall that Ms. Forbes creates so admirably. As it is the message of the album remains unclear other than that a bunch of musicians just got together and played a number of random songs. To achieve which, you don't really need to go to Pink Martini.
0143119680|1.0|This book is bad and a waste of money and time.  The heroine (Diana) which is supposed to be strong and independent, is so lame that you end up skipping pages just to get to the meat of the  book, which could be written in 100 pages.  She mostly sleeps, eats, drinks tea and discusses her inability to do magic and how wine can taste.  I never knew that you could describe the taste of wine in so many different ways.  And believe me, there are probably 100 pages written on the taste of wine.  The book doesn't move and the heroine is just dependent on her love object.  Also, sometimes you get a feeling that the author didn't know what to do with Diana and makes her sleep - all the time.  Like after her finding the photo of her dead parents.  I think she slept for 36 hours or longer and whenever she was told to sleep, she went to sleep.  And 15 minutes after waking up she goes to sleep again.  I hate books which are inconsistent and unrealistic (as much as a fantasy can be realistic).  Had I seen the reviews on Amazon, I would have never bought the book, as I always check the 1 star reviews, but because I got it in a regular store, I wasted 9.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|totally worth it... id pay money for this if it wasn't free... passes time amazingly well and I enjoy it very much
B000OPPBEQ|4.0|The movies video/audio quality is great. My only issue with the movies is that when you first play them it doesn't take you to the DVD menu. You are left to figure out how to get there. Also, the packaging is very cheap compared to the Lord of the Ring Trilogy box set.
B002984AJI|4.0|I first wanted to comment on the vinyl release since it seems nobody else has. It's a double album, white vinyl, and comes with a copy of the CD also. Those are the things I wanted to know before I bought.<br /><br />Now for the music it's just what I was hoping for. Moby has his dance music side, and his mood music side. Wait For Me is the latter, and I'm happy it is. Well constructed and moving songs, many with female vocals. I listen to a lot of electronica, and Moby is one of few that really taps into my emotional core. I can sit on my couch looking out the window and just feel these songs. Not every track is a winner, but the album is quite consistent and pleasing.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|fun game and free so I cant complain. lots of games but some are stupid or to hard. ads are a little over the top also.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I love it. its easy to use and its fun when ur on the go or waiting for something. keeps the kids entertained also.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app is easy to use. I love all the Bible translation and reading plan choices. I look forward to my daily devotional reading and hearing from God. This is truly a blessing.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|Why is this game free on my phone but not on my Kindle Fire? I know it's only 99 but I'm not paying for it when it should be free. ;)
B005V2EVBQ|4.0|I bought this Microshell case for my wife's Kindle that I got her this last Christmas. This case was straight forward in its installation, it seems quite durable and fits around the product nicely. The outside has a black teflon surface which allows for a non-slip grip, although the surface smudges with finger grease quite easily.  The inside flap that covers the screen is a bit flimsy, but if you're not rough with it, it should last you quite a long time. It also has a nice felt-like surface on this inside so that it doesn't scratch your Kindle screen, this was an excellent touch to the overall product. The screen flap also has a crease down the middle to allow it to bend in half so that it can hold the Kindle upright while sitting on a flat surface. Over time, I believe this crease may crack and break apart, but if you don't use the crease to prop the Kindle up alot I wouldn't worry too much.  This case also has a stretchy band that allows the front flap to be held in place to protect the device while it is not in use.  The manufacturer also took into account where the Kindle's speakers/power buttons etc. are located and allowed the case to not cover these areas.  This was an excellent and cheap buy for my wife's Kindle, we're both quite happy with it.  Pros:  -Cheaper than other cases out there.  -Tough case, with a teflon/non-slip grip feel to it.  -Inside of screen flap protector has felt-like cloth to prevent screen scratches.  -Well designed - case doesn't cover speakers/power buttons etc.  -Stretch band that secures front flap against screen while not in use.  Cons:  -Cheap, front flap crease may be prone to wear and tear over time.  -Teflon surface catches all finger grease, easily removed though.  All in all a very great, cheap, cover for the Kindle Fire! Worth the buy.
B003U0AHBO|5.0|I love Ridley Scott's movies. I have yet to see one that didn't at least spark my imagination. Like so many of his movies, this one wasn't very well received at the box office. The reason for that I think is this: if your expecting the Kevin Costner Robin Hood, this isn't it. Totally different on all fronts. However, this is one of my favorite Ridley Scott movies (next to Alien and Legend of course). The acting is spot on, the scenes are epic and accurate, and the story is riveting. It has all the classic \\"hero\\" moments, but also a few surprises that give this movie a very real kind of feeling. It has some laughs, and some great battle scenes, even Russel Crowe doesn't come across as annoying, rather quite heroic but not in a smarmy way (im not a big fan of Russel Crowe). I feel that this movie, like so many of Ridley Scott's others, will gain more credit as the years go by. Definatly worth owning this movie!<br /><br />The only thing I wasn't particularly happy with was the scene of Marion charging into battle the french. Didint seem to have much purpose other than for Robin to rescue her. Again, not a big deal, still LOVE the movie
B000P6YNSE|1.0|horrible! over priced rip off. never purchase from them if you do not want bad products. No appreciation for the customer.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|great game! very fun and addictive! simple to play and easy to leave then come back to. I would recommend for any age.
B002UNMW7O|5.0|One of the problems with reviews is telling how much you like or dislike, and why, without giving away too much of the plot. I've got BOONDOCK SAINTS I and II, and both are excellent. The acting, the occasional humor, the action and the script for both these very underated movies is just wonderful.<br /><br />SPOILER: If you haven't seen BOONDOCK SAINTS (the first movie, please don't go any farther but go ahead and buy it, rent it, whatever - you won't be sorry. You really do need to see the first one, though, to understand and appreciate in total the second one.)<br /><br />Basic plot: Two Irish brothers, through a kind of vision from God, become a sort of modern day Robin Hoods, going after the nastier criminal element of Boston. In BS II, they are in Ireland and a death of a priest, done as a message to them, brings them back to town with a new sidekick and the fun begins again. The wonderful Willem Defoe is in the first movie. His replacement, Julie Benz, was such a shock that it took a couple of viewings for me to really appreciate her. Both she and Defoe are FBI agents in the most bizaare context. I have no other way to put that. The brothers, Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus are perfect for the roles, as is their father, played by Billy Connolly. I've heard talk of a third movie being made but if so, it isn't in production yet.<br /><br />While I don't really care to talk about two movies in one review, it is necessary in this case. See the original, then get this one, too. Seriously, you won't regret either.
B006ZB3V2C|5.0|OMG I'm so excited this is on Amazon now! This app is in short the best sleep noise app out there, hands down! I have had it from the Android market for over a year and its awesomely amazing! I hate to see its so much on Amazon, but I will keep fingers crossed it might be the Free App of the Day soon...would love to see what other features it has for only $4.99! Come on make it a FAoTD Amazon!!! I would be first in line!
0307454541|5.0|I really didn't know what to expect before I started reading this book. However, once you start reading the book pulls you in and you don't want to put it down. I also found it interesting that the author had two different but related plots but managed to pull them together in the same story. I also wondered where the author got the idea for his female heroine. All in all it is a book that everyone will enjoy.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|plenty of games FOR FREE! only just started playing but I can tell it will be a while before I'm done with this one
B002RKSZN0|5.0|The main characters Fanny and Edmund are probably the most heart warming and enviable characters I have ever read. I absolutely adore this book. I could hardly put it down. I would often stay up until 2am reading. Definitely a book you will re-read again and again.
B001HNE3NO|5.0|Sarah's key is by Tatiana De Rosnay. Published in 2008, De Rosnay originally wrote Sarahs Key in her mother tongue, english. Sarah's Key has sold over three million copies worldwide. It focuses on three main characters, Julia Jarmond an American journalist, Sarah Starzynski, and Michell Starzynski, Jewish siblings living during world war II.    In Sarah's Key there are characters with many different personalities. Julia is curious, considerate, and at times confused. Her husband Bertrand is unwilling to accept her curiosity and does not support her decisions regarding her findings about Sarah. Their daughter Zoe is kind and does not only accept her mothers decisions but is also interested in Sarah's story. Edouard Tezac is Bertrand's father, who is hesitant on Julia finding out more information about Sarah, but finally trusts her enough with a huge secret he has carried for years.    Sarah's Key takes place in present day Paris, France. There are two parts to the story, one takes place in the 1940's and the other in the present.With that said the story flips back and forth. Julia, the journalist, starts to investigate the Vel d' Hiv roundup in 1942. The other side to the story dictates a young girl, Sarah's struggles trying to deal with the death of her brother Michell while she has all the guilt set on her. She left her brother locked in a closet thinking he would be safe there. It vividly describes what she and her mother and father went through when they were separated in the concentration camp after leaving the enormous stadium in France. Sarah escapes the camp and tries to save her brother and stays with an elderly couple who take her in, the Dufaures.    When Sarah gets to her old apartment, already taken over by another family, the Tezacs which was when Edouard was a young boy, she finds that her brother did not survive. All of this information made Julia want to find Sarah because she moved to New York. Instead, Julia finds that Sarah had committed suicide but she had a son, William Rainsferd. At first he resists knowing anything about her but then feels he needs to know the truth. During all this, Julia finds out she is pregnant and that her husband does not want to keep the child. The couple separate and she happily has her baby.    I would Recommend this book to people who enjoy an interesting but heartbreaking/mysterious book. This book is interesting because of all the information that is unraveled throughout it, not only about tough times during World War II, but also is the present. It's the best of both worlds.
B000MR9D5E|4.0|I bought this series for my boyfriend who loves documentaries. He likes the movies but feels that they move just a little too slow. So if you have a ton of time to kill then this series is great!  Overall the picture quality is amazing and it shipped pretty quick
0545265355|5.0|These are great stories.  I kept thinking about what was happening, and I couldn't wait to get home from work so I could continue reading.
B003L77GGA|4.0|The product was excellent and a welcomed end. Seeing that Smallville was a pre-Superman time period, I was bothered by how the series continually limited his ability, stretched out his learning curve, and dumb down his intellect. The series was entertaining and disturbing at the same time. \\"Somebody Save Me\\" will always be a memorable tune.
B003V4AK8E|1.0|Hopefully the controller I received was just a defective one and that they aren't all this bad... This controller never worked properly.  It would only sync with the Playstation about 25% of the time, and even then it was very difficult to use.  As other have stated, there is a huge \\"dead zone\\" in the analog sticks.  This makes it very difficult to use for games like MW3.  The controller is also bulky and doesn't seem to feel right... I'm likely somewhat used to the Playstation remote, but I also have an XBOX 360 and don't have any trouble using those remotes.  The final straw was when I was using the remote while playing MW3 online with my son.  I plugged the cord in and the controller actually synced up okay (much to our surprise), but lost signal about halfway through the first match (I never even disconnected the cord).  I tried and tried to get it to sync back up with no luck.  I am returning this one and have already ordered a camo Sony brand controller (as I should've done in the first place).

B0034G4OUY|5.0|This was a good movie with a decent amount of action. The movie kept you guessing who the behind the scenes person was. For an adrenaline rush I would recommend this film.
B005J6LKVI|5.0|The Help is one of the best books I have read in a long time. I was glad it was made into a movie and fans of the book were not cheated in the big screen version. I ordered the DVD/Blu-ray combo for my mom for Christmas and watched the Blu-ray version at her house. This is a movie that plays beautiful on a large screen television. The Blu-ray transfer is excellent and the extra features on the disc are worth watching. My mom was really happy with her gift and it is a movie that can be watched more than once.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Loads of fun.  Challenging and entertaining.  Ads are a mild nuisance but they are relatively infrequent.  There are some quality solicitations when they do occur.
B002C6A6N6|5.0|Some of my first memories include sitting in the living room while my mother watched Dr. Quinn.  She even went so far as to obsessively record every episode on VHS.  Time has passed and the old VHS tapes don't work like they used to.  Needless to say when I saw the complete series -Movies included! -I had to purchase it for her.<br />Amazon offers a spectacular value for this timeless series -easily affordable for a even a college student.  The DVDs are painstakingly packaged with the utmost care.  Each case contains some variation in packaging style, although most of them overlap on the holders.  However, if handled responsibly, the packaging should remain intact and keep these DVDs safe.  All the DVDs arrived intact and accounted for.<br />The quality of the DVDs themselves is great.  The picture quality is clear and the DVDs are, so far, playing well.  The DVD menu interface is direct and easy to navigate for those who may not be tech savvy.  I anticipate many nights with my family once again watching this nostalgic series.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|We got this game for Christmas and played it every night over the holiday break (7 days).  It never got old and the game changes with each play.  I would recommend this to anyone and i can't wait to purchase the expansion pack for 5 to 6 players!
B00177YA1K|5.0|We thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Amazon made it easy to purchase. We have always wanted to own it and now that a third movie is coming to the movies soon, we can see how it fits together. This a good family movie

B00008YLV2|5.0|Well it's been a little over a month since I reviewed a movie this will be my 1st movie review of 2012 & this is a new set of reviews called 20 Years Ago & 2002 in film. But I'm going to start off with The 2002 classic if you want to call it that Black Hawk Down this movie what can I say it has stuck with me since I 1st saw it on TV in 2003. Directed by Ridley Scott who directed Blade Runner, Alien Thelma & Louise, GI Jane & Hannibal. I know he's directing Promethous which I have no hope for. I have gave up on both Alien & Predator franchises. But I am here to review & give my thoughts on Black Hawk Down starring Josh Hartnett as Matt Eversmann, Ewan McGregor as John Grimes, Orlando Bloom as Todd Blackburn, Tom Sizemore Danny McKnight, Ewen Bremmner as Shawn Nelson, Eric Bana as Norm Hooten &  Jason Isaacs as Captain Mike Steele the movie has a huge cast some of them were up & comers in acting, The story is back in the early 90's a crisis broke out in The Eastern African Contury of Somali a a cival started lots of men with families died they either starved to death or by the hand of The Warlord Aidid. I remember hearing about Somali on the news & there was Soldiers dragged through the streets of Mogadishu the capital of Somali. In 1992 The UN sent Peacekeepers that tried to help aid the war torn country. Aidid declared war on them. So in The Summer of 1993 The US Government sent in The Army Rangers The Delta Force & The 106th Special Operations Avation Regiment to capture Mohammed Farrah Aidid.  This is where your introduced to the group of characters Matt Eversmann an Idealist Blackburn, Luietenant McKnight & Hooten. I would say Hooten was my favorite character I like the scene where he tells Eversmann \\" It doesn't matter what I think cause when the 1st bullet flies by all that bulls  h  i  t about politics goes out the window .\\"  I know I didn't do anywhere as good as Eric Bana did with that quote. John Grimes he was funny \\" You know when Desert Storm happend I wasn't there with my brothers. I was making the coffee. When that s  h  it went down in Panama I was making the coffee. You have Blackburn he is a  bad  a  s  s he tells this guy like it is cause this new recruit thinks he's going to kick some a  s  s in The Mog as The Troops call it. Blackburn just tells him like it is. When they go out in battle Eversman is in charge. They fly into the city by a Blackhawk Helicopter The Soldiers deploy out of Blackburn accidently falls to his death. Then all h  e  l  l breaks loose & give credit to Ridley Scott he did a great job it was well shot how he filmed all these battles these scenes are very violent. There's this guy Durant who is hurt he was in a Helicopter Crash he can't walk the scene where he is taken by these Milita Men & he keeps trying to grap the picture of his wife & son is very sad.Eversmann feels responsible for everything that happend cause he wanted everything to go smoothly. There are some brutal scenes like a Soldier blown in half I know it's a movie but I feel for this guy. The back of the box says Ridley Scotts vision is awesome & I agree with the critics for once. These guys act like American Soldiers unlike The Hurt Locker I didn't feel anything for those guys I didn't care about them like the guys in this movie or Saving Privet Ryan or even We Were Soldiers. Josh Hartnett's ending monolouge was great. He definitly does a better job here than he did in Peral Harbor which was Michael Bay's fan fiction. The part with Eric Bana's line where he talks about when he goes back home is great Im not repeating it if you've never watched this movie I want you to hear that quote. This cast cliclks well together. I know I didn't go over the plot well but what can I say about this movie that hasn't already been said. Ridley Scott I know he didn't do any movies that impressed me after this but he did a great job here. The cast did a wounderful job. I picked this up for $8 at The Dollar Store which is the 3 disc version with tons of features on it. If you never saw this movie I recommend that you see it sometime.
B004G6009U|4.0|This is the favorite movie in our 3 1/2 year old's rotation.  It's done well and is tolerable for adults to watch with enough humor to keep you interested.
B0057O6IMS|4.0|Was it wrong that I was pulling for the annoying kid to remain trapped in the basement? Basements are inherently scary places. Allow the Godfather (and, occasionally, Maestro) of Gore, Lucio Fulci, to illustrate why. THE HOUSE BY THE CEMETERY came out in 1981 but it hasn't lost its vitality or its ability to generate them shudders and spine-tingling chills. Here, Fulci's affinity for the lurid is on full exhibition. But when is it never?<br /><br />THE HOUSE BY THE CEMETERY opens with a shot of Daniela Doria who you may remember as having literally puked out her guts in CITY OF THE LIVING DEAD. This time something else comes tearing out of her mouth, namely a sharp blade which had entered by way of the back of her skull. Poor Daniela Doria, the eternal victim on celluloid. The camera then shifts to the Boyle family as they relocate from New York City to a forbidding oak mansion in New England. Not that this was a deal breaker, but there's a macabre history attached to the Boyle's new home, what with its most recent resident having hung himself. And when Lucy Boyle (gorgeous Catriona MacColl) makes mention of the graveyard next door and that strange tombstone in the hallway, her husband (Paolo Malco) brushes away her concerns. \\"This ain't New York,\\" he scoffs. No, not even a terrifyingly tenacious bat can dissuade this guy. Maybe someone should've paid heed to the freaky little psychic girl who keeps warning people not to go into the house.<br /><br />This has been repeated ad nauseam: Lucio Fulci is an exciting but flawed filmmaker. Caught between either coherence or sensationalism, he always went with the flash and the show, sacrificing script and internal logic. Once again, here's a film that finds Fulci champing at the bits, eager to get to the scary set pieces. Ghoulish innuendo and creaky noises and the establishing of plot points can only sate him for so long. Gorehounds will be well pleased with Fulci yet again. He treats us to gruesome decapitations and prolonged scenes of graphic stabby stabby. Fun fact: A blade can be cruel to human skin. Somewhere, the creators of SAW may have gone \\"Hmmmm...\\"<br /><br />The acting is negligible, although credit Catriona MacColl for playing \\"Lucy Boyle\\" with such nerve-jangling fragility. The English dub is mostly passable. The one exception is the dubious dubbing of the little Boyle boy which is so aggravating that even the actor who played the boy is compelled to apologize in the DVD bonus interview, assuring his fans that that wasn't his voice (\\"Sorry, sorry, don't hate me for that.\\").<br /><br />THE HOUSE BY THE CEMETERY is part ghost story, part slasher flick. Fulci makes good use of the haunted house score and ominous camera compositions to build up unbearable tension. The big bad, when finally revealed, is worth the wait as he looks absolutely menacing. And, of course, he lurks in the basement. Basements (and cellars) are, to reiterate, scary places. They're meant not as much to store fine wine but rather to provide a venue to conduct terrifying, inhumane experiments. It's the sort of place in which a fella can comfortably say things like: \\"He needs human victims... to renew his cells. It's how he stays alive.\\" The ending is typical Lucio Fulci, meaning that it is dark and bleak and unsettling. It puts the punctuation on a nifty little horror cult classic.<br /><br />This is the Special Edition DVD. Note that you can set up the audio either in English or Italian (although the boy is less grating on the ears in Italian), with sub-titles available in English, French, or Spanish. The bonus features are:<br /><br />- \\"Meet the Boyles\\" - Interviews with actors Catriona MacColl (still gorgeous) and Paolo Malco (14 minutes)<br />- \\"Children of the Night\\" - Interviews with actors Giovanni Frezza and Silvia Collatina, who played the kids in the film (12 minutes)<br />- \\"Tales of Laura Gittleson\\" - Interview with actor Dagmar Lassander (9 minutes)<br />- \\"My Time with Terror\\" - Interview with actor Carlo De Mejo (9 minutes)<br />- Deleted Scene - Bat Attack Aftermath (without audio and lasting about 30 seconds)<br />- International and U.S. Trailers<br />- TV Spot<br />- Poster & Still Galleryw with actor Carlo De Mejo (9 minutes)<br />- Deleted Scene - Bat Attack Aftermath (without audio and lasting about 30 seconds)<br />- International and U.S. Trailers<br />- TV Spot<br />- Poster & Still Gallery

B005CKPQHA|5.0|I started watching season 1 with some apprehension.  I found the subject matter vaguely unappealing, as I did the main characters.  However, the show had come  highly recommended by a reliable source and I persevered.  Still, I wasn't absolutely sold after the first season, despite admitting readily that the writing and story line were innovative and unpredictable and the direction and camera work stunning.  More than 2 years later I caught up with the second, third and fourth seasons, again having been advised by my friend not to miss out.  However this time I fell right into it and gobbled up the entire fare in the shortest possible time.  WOW!  Even my wife, who normally refuses point blank to watch films with too much violence, was completely mesmerized.  Without hesitation or exception, I now consider Breaking Bad one of the VERY BEST shows that TV has to offer and what is more, that I have ever seen.  WHY?  Because it satisfies deeply and intelligently on just about all levels.  The writing, camera work, editing, the total freshness and unpredictability of events to come, its innate intelligence, AND, above all, the outstanding humor (if deliciously black).  And there there's the totally remarkable and utterly believable acting from all concerned.  For fear of omission, I'd rather not mention any names, as all of the main characters' performances are beautifully crafted and superbly executed.  Well done to you all!  I really hope and trust that the people responsible for the creation of this amazing series, have received the praise that they deserve.  If not, that some of them may read this accolade
B006W0QOF2|4.0|This movie is very good - it is not by any means a mainstream movie, and many people may not like it.  It is very violent, however the cast is very good, the story is interesting, and Ryan Gosling is absolutely perfect for his role. I also liked the romance part of it - nothing graphic, most of the acting is not even in the dialogue but rather in gestures and facial expressions - very well done. The music was also ver good - it really conveyed the mood of each scene.

B003XF1XOQ|3.0|When I read other reviews for this book I was a bit put off by the vast number of negative reviews for the book.  I found the first half of the book a bit slow versus the first two books but perhaps it was necessary for character development for the amount of trauma and development all the characters went through in the first two books.  I absolutely loved, loved the first two books.  This one took quite a while to develop, the second half of the book is quite a whirlwind and I won't spoil it for anyone but now that I've read it I found the end quite fitting for the story line.  Others might not think so, and might find the end a cop out but Katniss was a character pushed out to her limits and while I did find her litanies a bit monotonous by the third book I'm really glad where her character finally went in the third book.  Other characters not so much but you can't everything in a series such as this, thanks Susanne Collins for a mostly great trilogy :)
0525478817|4.0|One of the most frustrating things about this book is trying to describe it to someone else without them getting overly sympathetic about the main characters' health status. Although the characters' health is obviously a main theme throughout the book, I found that the most interesting parts of this book actually concerned the main characters' introspective views on life itself.  The author manages to weave various philosophical musings into the lives of relatively intelligent teenagers who have decided to accept their lives for what they are; and live those lives to the fullest!
B006MQRLSA|4.0|I do not know much about baseball.  I am not familiar with how baseball teams are generally managed, and the sport itself does not fascinate me.  However, I was interested in the storyline depite these things, and surprised by how well this movie was written and made easy to understand even for people who are not baseball buffs.  The mechanics of the baseball team management were interesting even to a clueless viewer like me.  If you do not know much about baseball, it helps to watch this movie with someone who does understand the game at least a little bit - I watched the movie with my husband and he had to explain some things to me but overall we both enjoyed it and found it very good.  Brad Pitt was really good in this movie.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love YouVersion's Bible app. It offers all versions of the Bible along with the ability for your device to read it to you. It offers all types of readings plans such as The One Year Bible all the way to daily devotionals and scripture for specific life issues. My wife and I use YouVersion for our daily readings together. It is unbelievable how taking the time to include God in your daily life can bless you and your family. Thank you YouVersion and God Bless You.

0784010501|2.0|A potentially good concert film evolves into a Madonna hagiography. Some excellent music is overshadowed by the singer's continual ego-tripping. Alek Keshishian receives director credit, but the Material Girl pulls the strings. Even die-hard fans deserve more entertainment value.
1466311649|1.0|I would strongly advise the buyer to purchase this book from a different seller/publisher (no where in this book is a publisher even mentioned....). It has writing in it (hihglighted phrases, ect.), a good deal of the text is unreadable, and many of the illustrations are incoherent. Basicaly it looks like someone poorly photocopied their personal book, or printed it from a PDF on a printer that was running out of ink, and put a fancy cover on it-which need i even mentione is not even Bridgman's work..
B00006RCNJ|5.0|Enjoyable concert and most soothing and relaxing to watch. I would recommend this product and others as it is high quality.

B003WUYOQ6|5.0|First off - he's right.  Period.  If you've never been overweight or struggled with obesity or TRIED a low-carb diet, then this book isn't for you.  The book is very technical in his language, so if you're into the inner-workings of the body, you'll get a lot out of it.<br /><br />The negative reviews about the book?  Well, I ignore them.  Heck - I didn't even CONSIDER them.  I've done Atkins and low-carb diets and they work on me.  When I add sugar and processed foods (even fruits for that matter) back into my diet, my body FREAKS OUT and I mean:  deep slumber, deep depression, lack of energy, and I crave more and more - exactly like an addict.  Same with breads, pastas, etc.  So, there is truth to the books content and for those disputing it....I just wonder if they've ever struggled with weight or whether they're simply judging obese people as \\"lazy\\" - further buying into that incorrect notion.
B0034G4P4O|5.0|The Adventures of Tintin is a spectacular movie. I saw it in theaters on the 16th, and my mind was totally blown. Prior to seeing it I'd underestimated the movie- mistaking it for a little kid movie that probably wasn't worth going. Of course, I had no idea how awesome Tintin was until then.  All of the animation was incredible. The CGI made the movie look like real life, and a couple times I even found myself forgetting that it was animated! Good job Stephen Speildburg ;-)  After seeing Tintin, I reaserched him a bit on Wikipedia. I have to say, I was suprised at how much cool stuff like this passed right by me in the world. Not like it's the first time, but still.  I can only describe the main plot as this: take one part Indiana Jones, one part Alex Rider, and just a dash of Pirates of the Carribean, and stir until well blended.  Now, because of the movie, I'm going to read the comics, maybe watch the animated show, and get it ASAP. Tintin and I are going to have a good friendship by the time it comes out on DVD.  All in all, definitely worth the price of the tickets. Take your kids, take your kids' kids, even take your parents if you can. This movie is sure to be a hit with the family.  Just one thing that confused me: How old is Tintin? He seems pretty young, maybe 15 (he looks even younger than that to me in the comics!), but how many 15-year-olds in the 1940's had their own apartment, was a well-known reporter, and carried a gun just in case? (Correct me on my history if nessecary. I've always been bad at that subject in school :-P) Probably none, but that still made little sense to me.
1576875776|5.0|I'm surprised how many one, two and three star reviews there are for this excellent photo book.  On any level it really can't be faulted.  Blank pages in a photo book are quite common though here the confusion was probably caused by having them very close to each other and repeated as such throughout the pages.  Book designers would normally space a few blanks roughly evenly between all the photos.  The printing by Asia Pacific is comparable to any other quality printed art book (and it costs less than high-end printing in Europe or the US).  The duotones use a 200 screen on a very acceptable 157gsm matt art with perfect register.  The slight black/ochre feel to these photos, I thought, was a reasonable color choice.<br /><br />As to Vivian Maier's photos, the 106 in the book are quite stunning.  In particular the framing is just prefect and I think this separates her work from other well known street photographers especially those classed as the New York School who go for a more emotional style of imagery.  The photos reveal everyday street scenes in Chicago and New York and work so well because they always pull you into the composition without any distractions about what to look at first.  The pacing helps here too, close-up portraits merge into medium shots and then, perhaps, a long shot saturated with detail.  The more I looked through these pages the more the sequencing added to the photos.<br /><br />If I have a criticism it is that there is really nothing about Vivian Maier.  Her named website gives some background and I think it would have been helpful to the reader to have included some of this material<br /><br />John Maloof, the book's editor, is to be congratulated on finding and preserving a treasure trove of photos by an unknown photographer who had such a remarkable eye.  I'm hoping this will be the first of many books revealing Ms Maier's creative vision.

B0053VKP8S|5.0|This product is exactly as described.  I checked my TV settings before purchasing to make sure they accommodated this device.  The \\"this product does not work with Dolby Digital\\" worried me so I checked my audio settings before purchasing this device.  My TV could be changed to the appropriate audio settings and after this change all I had to do was plug it in and play.  Now I have sound through my stereo.  I also purchased digital audio cables since this does not come with any cables.
0761158820|5.0|My boys are absolutely loving this book.  They love reading the stories that go along with each monster.  I suggest you start off with the easy ones.

And also in the description, it says that the cover features Lord Voldemort and Harry! Only available for a limited time. And it was not included.  So I want an answer....

1416562591|2.0|Adiga's book is truly a shallow representation of life in the Darkness and of the people who move from there into the \\"Light\\". There are some incredibly irresponsible and shock mongering \\"scenes\\", especially the exchange between two northern politicians referring to southerners derogatorily as Negroes. It just seems like such a hoax perpetrated on the gullible western audience simply by the fact that Adiga chose to use words like Negro in direct translation of what was a conversation in Hindi when no such word exists in the lexicon. After reading the book the Man Booker seemed easy to get. The jury doesn't have any means to calibrate the accuracy and authenticism of the theme or the language. Thoroughly improbable characters and most excruciatingly contrived dialogue. It pained me to imagine fitting those conversations into everyday Indian bodies. The book itself, being in artificially Indianized english throughout, doesn't add one stripe to literary advancement for the individual or for literature itself. Watch a Mithun Chakraborthi movie from the 1980s instead of reading this book.
B001ILFUDM|5.0|\\"Pinocchio\\" is now out on Blu-ray and it looks gorgeous. This Disney classic has some of the prettiest animation I've ever seen, plus top notch songs and characters. The story is a little slow, but it picks up speed as it goes. The animation is the best part, because the use of color is wonderful, and there are many creative toys and clocks. The story is a nice change for Disney, in that there is no young woman waiting for her Prince to come. The Blu-ray release has commentary from historians. Most of the extras are on a separate \\"Bonus Material\\" Blu-ray disc, which is available to rent. Reviewed 3/19/2009 after watching on Blu-ray.
B005QI4TP8|5.0|As a big fan of the first album, I was initially disappointed in her new one. But the more I listened to it the more I loved it. Now I can never get enough... it has been my most played album of the year. Crank up the volume and immerse yourself in the beauty of Ceremonials.
B0025KW29U|5.0|For fans of Joss Whedon's \\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\\", particularly the musical episode, the Emmy Award-winning \\"Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog\\" is the best thing ever. Joss Whedon and friends made this funny and touching musical, with great music and characters. Neil Patrick Harris is the best I've ever seen him in the title role of Dr. Horrible, and Nathan Fillion (from \\"Firefly\\") is also grand. The DVD and blu-ray have a lot of nice extras, including a singing commentary track, with all new songs. The music in the commentary songs is okay, but the lyrics and jokes are great. The DVD and blu-ray also have making of featurettes, and three extremely well hidden Easter eggs (I recommend just looking them up on the web). Again, for Joss Whedon fans, \\"Dr. Horrible\\" is as good as it gets. I liked it more and more with repeated viewings as well. For Buffy fans to not watch this would be like \\"Star Wars\\" fans not watching \\"The Empire Strikes Back\\". Reviewed 3/7/2009 after watching at least fifty times on hulu, watching the DVD, the blu-ray, all the DVD extras and Easter eggs, and listening to the CD soundtrack (also available at amazon). No, I am not Joss is disguise promoting this; I'm a rabid fanboy, and proud of it.
0061122416|5.0|BEST BOOK I've ever read...HANDS DOWN!!!! There are so many valuable lessons, principles, and teachings in this book it should be illegal.

Paulo youre a GENIUS!!!
B0016QNSFQ|3.0|\\"Wittgenstein\\" is a good dramatization of the life and work of the 20th century philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein. Mostly philosophers would be interested in this film, because Wittgenstein's life centered around his philosophy, which is very technical. Gay men might also be interested in the movie, because Wittgenstein and director Derek Jarman were gay, and Wittgenstein's homosexuality is one of the topics of the movie. Karl Johnson does a good job of portraying Wittgenstein and his emotional life, particularly his various frustrations at understanding the world and being understood; being a philosopher myself, I found this portrayal particularly moving. The film is shot rather like a play, with minimal sets. Other Cambridge intellectuals, such as Bertrand Russell, are portrayed in the film.
3442217784|5.0|Read the book and form your own opinions. Don't listen to the negative reviews. People think that by reading this book they will get all the answers to wealth and success. That's not how it works. You have to take the principles and teachings and put them to use in your own life. Robert didn't intend to hold your hand and guide you every step of the way. He intended to give you the necessary knowledge and principles he believes will guide you to success. This is a great read. I definitely recommend this book. All my kids will be reading this as well.
B005K2YRVG|5.0|PERFECT FOR THE KINDLE!!!!! Very durable and easier to get the Kindle out vs the typical protective case. I travel weekly and it protects my Kindle and still easily stores in a back pack.

0307888681|5.0|My husband has been a fan of the Zombie movie genre long before it suddenly became the \\"in\\" thing. With having seen most every Zombie film made and with \\"The Walking Dead\\" being on holiday hiatus, I wanted to make sure that he had a Zombie fix to help him get thru the dreariest weeks of winter.  Hubby is not a huge reader, so I was hesitant about getting this, but after seeing all the other rave reviews here, I decided to chance it. My husband LOVED this book and it's take on the Zombie story. He sat down and read sections from the book every night until he was done (sometimes it might take him months to finish a book).  I also knew this was a huge hit with him as he was enthusiastically telling me about various parts of it and what a great job the author did with this unusual concept on Zombies - stuff that he had never seen anyone else cover.  There are other reviewers on here who go into much more detail about the book, but suffice to say if you are looking for a solid interesting unusual read on Zombies, then this is the book for you or your Zombie lover!

B002VPE1WK|5.0|I needed a multi-purpose photo back pack for when I am bird watching or just out walking in the boonies.  I have a [[ASIN:B000EY5R8C Lowepro CompuDaypack]] but it does not hold enough equipment (although it does hold a laptop.)  I was really surprised by the low cost of this item and I have always had good luck with the Amazon Basic brand.  I decided to give it a shot.<br /><br />Overall I am happy with this bag.  It seems well made and thoughtfully designed.  A couple of nice touches are:<br /><br />*  The inside pocket have flaps that protect your equipment from getting scratched by the zipper puller.<br />*  The straps on the side of he case are easy to adjust and hold my good-sized Gitzo carbon-fiber tripod.<br />*  The backpack straps are more than I would expect on a little pack like this.  They not only go over your shoulders but also across your chest and waist.<br />*  There is a hand-strap on the top of the bag which allows me to carry it easily when I don't want it on my back.<br /><br />The only thing that disappointed me a little was it's size.  I am no novice when it comes to buying stuff like this online (I even used to be a buyer of camera bags or a major retailer back-in-the-day.)  Still, when I saw the Amazon box on my porch I was surprised.  All of the photos that I saw of it caused me to believe that it was bigger than it is.  I don't blame Amazon for this as they have the dimensions listed on the product page, I was just expecting it to be bigger.  I am posting a photo of the bag with a dollar bill on it just so others might get a better idea of this pack's size.<br /><br />Here is what I can fit in it:<br /><br />*  [[ASIN:B003BM7X6I Canon EOS 7D with a 18-135mm Lens]]<br />*  [[ASIN:B002NEFL8W Canon BG-E7 Battery Grip]]<br />*  [[ASIN:B0002Y5WXE Canon EF-S 10-22mm Lens]]<br />*  [[ASIN:B00007GQLU Canon EF 85mm f/1.8 Lens]]<br />*  [[ASIN:B001CCAISE Canon Speedlite 430EX II Flash]]<br />*  [[ASIN:B0001XH6G2 Canon 12x36 Image Stabilization II Binoculars]]<br />*  Plus batteries, filters, and various accessories.  My [[ASIN:B00007GQLS Canon EF 100-400mm]] is too big for this bag.<br /><br />This is a nice looking bag and if it had another name on it (like Lowepro, Tamrac, etc.) it would probably cost twice as much as it does.  I am glad that I got it, I just wish that it was bigger.GQLS Canon EF 100-400mm]] is too big for this bag.

B001D8W7CW|5.0|The acting is amazing, the music is eerie, the direction is flawless. One thing I like about this film is how it displays the issues with religious fanatacism-mostly thru Piper Laurie as Carrie's mother, who's obviously crazy, but also twists the scripture, and to a degree, I'm surprised alot of religious leaders weren't more up in arms over it's depiction of fanaticism. Yes, I'm a Christian, but unlike some, I refuse to shove my opinions down a total strangers throats, until they start trying the same tricks of twisted scriptures.  Now, this was far from the first SK movie I ever saw, and I've seen few I didn't like, Carrie was no exception. I wasn't an outcast, by any means in High School, but I can relate to her loneliness and isolation, the revenge storyline, Carrie's anyway, but the prankster's leader is a brat, and that's putting it mildly! The script is written very well-you despise the villians, but you really pity Carrie, unless you're cold-hearted.
1451627289|5.0|This book took me way longer than it should have to read due to school and other projects but I'm glad I finally found the motivation to finish it. Time travel is always a touchy subject but this book didn't confuse me at all. Even the string theory at the end was understandable. I'm a sucker for conspiracy theories so this was fantastic. Though some was obviously fiction, the subject was compelling and changed my perspective and beliefs a lot. The romance was such a great touch to this story as well. Sadie and Jake (George) really made me happy and even though most guys aren't into romantic books, this one didn't over-do it. The first person narrative was awesome as well. I could put myself in those situations and I really felt like I was following the character through every page of this book. The parallels (aka \\"Harmonies\\") in this book are also fun to point out and notice. It's intense, fun, suspenseful, hilarious, and so much more. I've only read 3 of King's novels, including this one, and I have to say, it may be his best. I can't see how he can top it. The subject matter was so interesting and his opinions were excellent. I paid attention to every detail and reading this book was a total blast. I definitely recommend this book to fans of time traveling, romance, the late 50's and early 60's, humor, and first-person narratives. It was so incredible and I'm sad it's over. Please read this book. It should get more credit than it's been given.

B005NPLXJ4|1.0|I was curious about this cd, since I saw Metallica and Lou play together at the R-n-R Hal of Fame Concerts.  To be clear, Metallica is one of my very favorites, and I like Lou's music, but am not familiar with all of it.  Going into listening to this album, I admit I read one scathing review, saw the bad reviews on Amazon, and someone I have known a long time at the local cd store told me that he \\"could never get through the whole thing\\".  So, I had some bad press before I got it - from my local library.  And, it is worse than I even thought.  The first song reminded me of my dog when I was a kid, that howled when my stereo was too loud.  It seemed like a lot of just jamming by the band, with Lou, in hoarse voice reciting poetry.  And, some bad poetry, for my listening.  It seems to be a bad idea to start with, thrown together, a bad match for two cd's, and a lot of just going through the motions.  It is the worst cd I have listened to in years.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|these are high words of praise, in my book. the dev did it right. controls are responsive. graphics are simple and clean. powerups are rewarding. great feature that it saves your game when you leave. thanks for a good app, dev, and great FAOTD, Amazon.
B005D0RDIE|5.0|This DVD is a lot of fun, right from the beginning, which starts out with the classic, campy \\"Rash\\" satire. We saw this same show live earlier in the tour, and I am enjoying the DVD of the Cleveland show every bit as much as the live act we caught in VA. The audio is so clear, you can see/here everything so well, in that sense it far surpasses the live show. So many of our favorite tunes are here, and the playing is simply superb. My son plays bass and he is crazy about Geddy (naturally!), and I play guitar and love all of Alex's work. And we are both in awe of Neil! Can't go wrong with this, it's a phenomenal tour de force from beginning to end. There will never be another band like Rush!
0783114893|4.0|Technical Details-This DVD was in English with no options for other languages. Under Languages, there were 2 audio options: 5.1 Dolby Digital and Dolby Surround. Case also stated Spanish Mono but there was no such option on the DVD. Under Subtitles, there were the following subtitle options: English; Francais(French); Espanol(Spanish); No Subtitles. Note that on this DVD, when first inserted, that the defaults were 5.1 Dolby Digital and English subtitles, whether you changed them previously or not. There were no detectable audio problems. Picture was color and displayed as letterbox on my 4:3 format TV, with black bars above and below picture. Case stated aspect ratio 16:9. Picture detail was poor in many scenes, with video noise(grainy) very noticeable in dark scenes(like the beginning of the movie) and in scenes where a dark object was on a light background. On the rest of the scenes, picture detail was good. Scene access performed using Chapters. Extras included Cast/Crew Bios and Theatrical Trailer. Cast/Crew Bios included Rutger Hauer, C.Thomas Howell, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Robert Harmon(director), and Eric Red(writer). Theatrical Trailer displayed as full screen and at reduced resolution.  This DVD did play on my Windows 7 Ultimate PC with a Dell HD monitor and resolution set at 1900 x 1200, using both Windows Media Player 12 and VideoLAN's VLC Player v.1.1.10. The picture displayed with small vertical black bars on each side of the picture for both Windows Media Player 12 and VideoLAN's VLC Player v.1.1.10. Resolution was not as good as on my 4:3 format TV. HD monitors vary in their ability to down convert a signal source(720p) below its capability(full HD). The video noise displayed as vertical bars, like the image had been divided into vertical sections, but mainly visible on dark scenes. Theatrical Trailer displayed with very small vertical black bars on each side of the picture for both WMP12 and VLC Player.  On my Windows XP SP3 laptop with resolution set at 1400x1050 using InterVideo WinDVD 7 software, the picture displayed better than on the HD monitor and the software controls are better as well than either Windows Media Player 12 or VideoLAN's VLC Player v.1.1.10. The picture displayed as letterbox. Note Theatrical Trailer also displayed as letterbox.  Note my rating was for content of movie, not for the technical details. Otherwise, my rating would be 2 stars, at the most.
B0043GN6XK|5.0|Having read all previous reviews, I am obliged to tell inexpert listeners like me that this is what you thought Vivaldi might have done once he got The Four Seasons out of the way.  Forget the mythology, the libretto, even the nit-picking about this or that singer: this is the Vivaldi we neophytes have been looking for!  I kept yelling \\"Yes!\\" the first couple of times I heard it.  I've bought only one other Vivaldi opera so far: Farnace.  Not as exciting listening as L'Ercole, not music I cheered on first hearing.  But it's Vivaldi showing off and no one does it better.  I also think music reviewers should use more space crediting the composer.  Singers, orchestras, conductors come and go, some good, some not so good.  But will there ever be another Bach, Beethoven, Schubert?  Or another Antonio Vivaldi?  Not in this unverse.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I have really enjoyed this game because of all the variety. great time killer, lots of fun different easy silly little games....is that twenty words yet?
B0054JZC6E|3.0|its okay, the games are short and get boring fast, but its a good free game. takes too long to unlock newer games also.
B006O5XYWG|3.0|I thought it was so-so.  I'm a James Franco fan, and he is what kept me going throughout this movie.  It had some good action and drama, and overall a well developed story line.  But my enjoyment of the movie was greatly impacted by the crappy streaming via Amazon.  It seemed whenever there was a good action packed scene, it would freeze to the Amazon logo and say \\"connecting\\".  I have a fully active internet connection, so it wasn't that.  Also, the quality went up and down.  At some points it looked almost HD quality, then at other times it would get really blurry and pixelated.  It really ruined any good feelings I had about this movie and was incredibly frustrating.  This was my first Amazon movie purchase with my Prime membership, and it certainly didn't inspire me to use this feature again.
B004RJMUJO|4.0|Fruit Ninjas is a fun &amp; exciting game . It sounds kind of easy but , believe me its not all that easy . I especially like the variety in the game . I love all the different blades &amp; backgrounds . It's kind does make you feel like a ninja (except for the fact that you slice fruit instead of people) . I recommend this app &amp; for 99 cents its a pretty good deal . It's also a great game for all ages .

B006HAPY26|5.0|This is a fabulous series for children aged 12 - 100. This is a captivating series. I can only wish books like this existed when I was a child. Well done Mr Muchamore.
B0019HQIFE|4.0|Video quality:  10/10.  This ranks among the best of my blu rays and is definitely worth buying over the DVD version.  The image is sharp, blacks are inky black, and there isn't a hint of graininess like you might see in some other blu rays.  For a more detailed (and better) review, check out [...]  Audio quality:  Honestly, I only played it through my tv's speakers so I guess I can't really comment on the actual sound quality but it sounded great to me.  Concert itself:  One of the best concerts I've seen.  The differences between the acoustic, trio, and full band set makes it almost seem like you're watching 3 different concerts.  Mayer is also by far the best live performer I've heard.  Most artists simply don't sound as good live as they do in the controlled environment of a recording studio, but Mayer is consistently solid in all of his performances.  Perhaps it's because he's basically just sitting or standing instead of jumping around the stage dancing but whatever the reason, it's pure bliss listening to him make that guitar sing.  Overall, at under 20 bucks, this is a great value and a must have for any Mayer fan.
0439023521|5.0|There is a fair amount of violence so I would not recommend it to younger readers. It is refreshing to see a strong female lead who, despite numerous hardships manages to succeed without sacrificing her beliefs in the process.
B004LP3AYI|4.0|In general, I found this book to be entertaining. I've only read the first two books in this series and I would describe them as entertaining if not necessarily the best written.  The real reason I wanted to write this review was to let Amazon know that the editing of the Kindle edition is horrible. Paragraphs are not indented (making dialogue difficult to follow in some instances), the word \\"than\\" is replaced by \\"that\\" (and vice versa) constantly, and there are loads upon loads of other small editorial mistakes. A few mistakes wouldn't be a big deal but they seemed endless. Amazon should really have this book re-edited.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|it will keep you busy but its not spectacular my daughter has the most fun with it. the sushi game doesn't work right but most of the others do.
0385534639|4.0|I really don't know where to begin when reviewing this wonderful but very quirky debut novel.  As a lover of the circus and of magic realism I really wanted this book to succeed.  In many respects it did.  I loved the whole magical atmosphere, the detailed, colourful descriptions of every aspect of this wonderful world of imagination and the account of the growing love between the two protagonists. Hence the 4 stars - although in truth it is hard to do an overall assessment.  In other respects, however, I found it very frustrating.  The chapters jump from one date to another in a seemingly random way (it is set at the end of the 19th/beginning of the 20th century)and I found it very difficult to keep track of the events. It would have required going back to check what else had happened on that particular date and I just found that too much trouble to bother. If I had been reading the book on Kindle I would have been even more frustrated.  Having been really caught up in the magic of the whole creation I was desperate to find out how it would all be resolved but I found the ending less than satisfying.    On the whole I would recommend the book.... it's wonderful to be immersed in the magic for hours at a stretch--- but if you like linear novels this is not for you.
1609611543|5.0|This book ended up being a multi-family member gift, as bits and parts of it were read to us by our Gluten Free daughter, we all began to see how wheat has impacted our lives. We bought 3 more copies! Very interesting, beautifully written with a touch of comedy thrown in.  The story behind altering wheat in the fight against hunger and how it has changed not only our waistlines, but our general health, is amazing.  Also interesting that Dr. Davis does differentiate between wheat and glutens.  The proliferation of man boobs & wheat totally impacted the men in our family!!!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|its ok gives opportunity for advancement with games you dont want to play. Games are mediocore and semi low quality
B0055SWM08|5.0|this game is wonderful in its simplicity.  A true logical puzzle game that is relaxing to boot.  Well worth the buck.
B005FMZX9Q|3.0|First of all let me say that I love the look of the watch.  It stands out and really catches the eye.  Of course the next thing I noticed is that the face is huge!  I expected the face to be large from the picture and because it's made for a man, but it was still larger than I expected.  Also, the ends of the hands are white and that requires more effort on my part to tell the time.  A quick glance just don't cut it with those white tipped ends over a white background.  I haven't had the opportunity to test the water resistance yet, but we will be going snorkeling/diving on vacation and I definitely plan to test it out then.  The cloth on the band was another surprise.  I guess I just took it for granted that such a high quality time piece would have a leather band.  There is leather underneath the cloth though.  The design of the band and the clasp keep the watch firmly in place and that is a good thing.  The cloth also looks nice.  It isn't cheap looking at all.  Overall, this is a very nice watch.  Unfortunately, I wouldn't pay retail for it, but if you can get it on sale, it's certainly worth it.

Something shady going on here. Why would you advertise a device that solves a problem(itouch,iphone,ipad) that does not exist.    Back she goes.    We'll see what info@kokkia has to say.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|The variety is decent. individually the games would seem a little inane but having them all together makes it a pretty good free app.
0312641893|5.0|Cinderella has been done so many times, there's rarely anything new. This book is the most original story and I think I like it better than the classic tale.<br /><br />~spoilers~<br />Cinder is a cyborg, living with the most irritating adopted mother ever. As a mechanic, Cinder must work all day to repair tech so that her mother and \\"normal\\" human siblings can buy expensive ball gowns and treat her like crap.<br /><br />The interesting thing about Cinder's world is that there is a plague attacking the human citizens. There doesn't seem to be much hope for a cure and when her mother gets tired of Cinder being around, she sells her to the crown for plague research.<br /><br />Her only saving grace is Prince Kai, who instantly falls in love with her while dropping his android off for service. But this isn't just a teeny-bopper love story. Cinder must overcome many obstacles to get her freedom and become thought of as a valid being.<br /><br />The spookiest part of this book is when the Queen of the Lunars shows up. They are people living on the moon who can glamour anyone they come in to contact with. The Queen is deadly and the image that this author puts forth of her dressed all in white, a white veil over her too perfect face, is chilling. There is a scene when the Queen looks out over a mob of thousands of angry citizens - people who don't want her on their world- and they suddenly all walk away, glamoured into losing their will and forgetting their cause. Awesome scary stuff.<br /><br />This seems to be setting up for a sequel as it ends in a cliffhanger and I can not wait to read the next book.<br /><br />I am really looking forward to if they make a movie of this. Cinder and her android friend Iko are so lovable, I'm sure they would steal the show, but the grand palace and Lunars would be awesome to see as well.<br /><br />I loved this book from start to finish and recommend it highly to any fairy-tale lover.
B005V2EVBQ|1.0|Yes it is light and simple however the quality is poor. The outer layer started peeling within 1 week   of using it. Now it looks several years old. I am going to try and return it.
0312641893|3.0|I can't say this book was bad. I can only say it was \\"okay\\". It definitely wasn't one of those books that grips you from the beginning. It moves a bit slowly and it isn't until almost 60% in that you really start to get an idea of what is happening in Cinder's world. Although Cinder is an interesting character, there is not much that sets her apart from other characters in this genre and prince Kai, though kind, doesn't get much of a back story. Maybe im just a \\"modern reader\\" but I really want my books to get me involved with the characters from the very beginning, not force me to take my relationship with them slowly. There is pretty much no action or excitement in this book either, which, for the future setting, was surprising. All in all, it still gets three stars for having an interesting premise and the potential to develop into a much more satisfying series, though it is likely I will not read the next book.  Summary: For those of you who are like me (adults) and constantly searching for the next Twilight/Hunger Games/Vampire Academy/Nightshade series, this is not it. Try Divergent if you haven't already or, if you like the idea of Cinder's story, try the Adoration of Jenna Fox...much better execution.
B004UXUX4Q|5.0|I looked at some of the other Amazon reviews and noticed some viewers found this film boring.  I am not one of them. The film is about a middle aged man who is in crisis because he has life altering decisions and events to face.  This character is played by George Clooney.  Some people when faced with immense land holdings in one of the richest real estate markets on earth, Hawaii, would be wastrels.  Not him.  He is an attorney who supports himself even though he has final power in a trust that involes huge land holdings which came from the original family.  Although these descendants all look white now, way back on his maternal end, there was a full Hawiaan great grandmother who was the heiress,<br /><br />What he is facing is that all of his relatives want to sell the land and he has that power under the trust.  They do not. Also, his wife was in a boating accident, ended up in a coma and now lays dying in a vegatative state.  She has signed a living will which everyone is honoring. He has two daughters who also must be brought into the picture.  They think she's going to recover.<br /><br />In the midst of all of the above, his older daughter tells him his wife was having an affair.  He decides to find the guy and tell him what has happened.  The guy is a real estate agent who stands to make a fortune if the land deal goes through,<br /><br />None of this is played at a melodramatic level.  It unfolds as it would likely unfold in real life, mostly very quietly.  Clooney does a wonderful job.  This is where we all live at some point, where there are decisions and events that will follow us until our days wind down.<br /><br />There is a small role of the dying wife's father which is really fantastic.  Everyone has experienced this kind of person.  Given the bad news of his daughter's coming death, his sole reaction from there to the end is to lash out and blame everyone.else in the family.  He even makes the accident their faults although the wife was with someone else who was driving the boat at the time of her accident. He never lets up, just finds new ways to continue the attack on others as the day of death moves closer.<br /><br />This film has Oscar written all over it and I expect it to do very well at the Oscars.

B004EPYZXK|2.0|While I will not give away the 'plot' of the movie, just in case you really want to waste your time and see it yourself, I will advise you to rent this movie from a dollar a day rental store. Otherwise, you are paying too much to see what amounts to nothing. Plus, if you have spent money to buy a hi-def television, this movie will irritate you even more, since you will spend the whole movie thinking you are back in 1982....with a broken 8mm movie reel....static, film spots and all.<br />I'll admit that the movie sounded like it might be interesting when I read the back of it at the video store. I became wary when all the previews were for zombie movies, (bad zombie movies at that) but figured, ok. I rented a horror movie, I should expect them to preview other horror movies. However, this is not a horror movie, unless you would put \\"The Goonies\\" in the horror section. My seven year old daughter would have loved this movie, and she wouldn't have blinked an eye or worried one bit about being scared.<br />I have to agree with another reviewer who said the whole \\"found footage\\" thing is getting old. The sad thing is, when I was done watching the movie (yes, I watched it all, unfortunately) I thought, Gee, too bad. This could have been a much better movie. The whole premise of 'scary stuff on the moon' could have been a thriller, if it had been done right.<br />All in all, do yourself a favor and don't buy this movie until you have rented it first. Otherwise you may find yourself staring at the television drooling from the lack of brain stimulation you just experienced.
B003R4ZMJU|5.0|Such a great show...I bought the DVD because of Emily and Maya's relationship.  This show and its diversity of characters gets an A+
B004EPZ06G|4.0|I'll agree this movie wasn't nearly as funny as the first. And yes, there seems to be a bit more crude humor in this one. However, if you watched The Hangover I then you should already be prepared for crude humor, even if it is a bit over the top. Just be prepared. You'll laugh, just not as often.<br />The boys are just as funny as ever, though I would have to say, the script really didn't give them a lot of room for that easy going friendship they seemed to have in the first movie. I was a little disappointed that they seemed to have lost that spark, but it's a rare sequel that is remotely as good as the first. That said, this sequel was better than some other sequels I've been unlucky enough to have paid to see.<br />A little warning to the ladies out there: Should you watch this movie and get offended, remember that it's guy humor! This movie wasn't made to leave you feeling good and sappy inside! It's made to leave you feeling like you've just been shocked and awed, and a little queasy feeling LOL And if anything in the movie itself offended you, for heavens sake, whatever you do DO NOT watch the end credits!
B00526ZKYS|5.0|After reading the sample for this on my kindle, I decided it was intriguing enough to buy. I read the entire thing in one day. I loved the concept of the book, the ideas, and the struggles. It reminded me a bit of Lois Lowry's The Giver as well as Ayn Rand's Anthem. It's somewhat similar to The Hunger Games, but I think truly the only comparison that can be made there is that they are both alt-universe\future and the government controls the people.  Delirium started off slow for me. Lena seemed like an unremarkable, does everything she's told type of character. Hana was far more interesting throughout the first few chapters. Just as I was about to get bored with Lena, she showed some life. She started changing, accepting that what she knew was a very brutal and well constructed lie. She fell for Alex rather fast, but I've read enough books to know that characters often fall in love faster than people would in real life. Read any romance novel and you'll realize that.  I liked Alex while I was reading, and I still like him now. There's only one problem with his character. He's perfect. I can't really find a flaw in him. He's always composed, he's always doing the right thing, which is exactly what Lena wants. I mean come on, how often do our loved ones always do the right thing? It seems to me that it is our loved ones that are pissing us off the most with their actions. There really wasn't a huge disagreement between Alex and Lena anywhere in the novel, except for when he revealed to her that he was an Invalid. It caused a brief controversy and made me want to bash Lena over the head when she went running away.  The ending was worth it though. I loved the ending. It harkens back to when she tells her interviewers the first time that she thinks Romeo and Juliet is beautiful. Their love becomes somewhat of a Romeo and Juliet tale. It also served to make Alex more perfect, but I won't go there.  Also the excerpts from government books and websites are awesome, althoughthe majority made me clench my fists and growl. I wanted to scream at the people that they were being stupid cowards and that they were completely wrong.  The book focuses on the central idea that you cannot have happiness without unhappiness. You have to take the good with the bad and hope that the good is enough to help you survive. Lena, Hana, and Alex have realized this, noticing how those that have been cured of love walk around in a fog. Cured people are emotionless, flat, monotone. I know life hurts, but what would your life be without the pain, without emotions? Even if I could never hurt, I don't think I'd want to walk around that hollow all the time. I'm curious to see if any other characters in the future will come to this realization or if Lena is truly alone.
B00664AM5C|3.0|I thought the movie dragged on and on. It started exciting from the very beginning and then lost its fire. The all star cast attracted me, but performances where lacking excitement.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Well... I really like this app a lot. Any negatives are just little tiny things. Also, consider this: it's free. You get what you pay for. Not in this case! I technically paid for nothing, but got over 10 free minigames, which I could use to earn points and unlock other games!!!!!! OVER 115 GAMES!!!!! Don't be stupid people!!!
B005CMSDLE|3.0|HANNA is beautifully filmed and directed with artful precision by Joe Wright.  The musical score by the Chemical Brothers is marvelous.  The performances from Saiorise Ronan, Eric Bana and Cate Blanchett are excellent.  The movie's opening and closing line - \\"I just missed your heart\\" - is chilling.  Likewise, the script does a good job in establishing Hanna's sudden insertion into a world quite alien to her, and her affinity to the vacationing family.<br />But in the end, HANNA left me feeling cold and detached.  The cruelty of secluding and training a teenage girl to be a vengeful assassin is unjustified and reprehensible.  HANNA is a well done film but not a pleasant movie experience.

Rhoda Williams ponders this very thought as she is released from prison after four years following a car crash in which she caused two people to lose their lives.<br /><br />A brilliant student of science, her MIT acceptance when she was 17 has been long over since the car crash, her only means of income working as part of the janitorial staff at a high school. The night of the accident, it was announced that another earth-like planet had been discovered, its location very close to our own, so close that it can be seen clear as day in the sky complete with its own moon. During incarceration, it's been studied though no attempts at contact have been made due to a lack of signals and interference. Once contact is made, however, a startling possibility is revealed, as this earth like planet is more than that, it may be a carbon copy of ours. A contest to win a trip to this new earth is being held, and Rhoda enters with a thought provoking essay about her experience. At the same time, she's trying to come to terms with her fatal mistake from years before, including attempting to apologize to the man whose wife and child died as a result. She can't bring herself to do so, and a spur of the moment little white lie grows into an even bigger one until the breaking point is reached.<br /><br />Another Earth is beautifully filmed, paced, and one of the most well acted movies I've ever had the pleasure of seeing. The budget was not huge and yet so much was done with so little, it's a wonderful accomplishment. The ending is spectacular, as the choice Rhoda makes leads to a personal consequence that one doesn't ponder due to being so engrossed in the story in front of us. Enjoy!
B005XQLBU4|4.0|download, install and play.... rinse &amp; repeat... doesn't get easier than this... need nine more words... wonder which ones they will be
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Good game, entertainment at all time, iove this game, needs an update soon, rockets don't respond very well some times
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I read all three, and LOVED the first two but this one was so empty of emotion, \\"humanity\\" and character development that I can't recommend it. I am having my teenaged son read the first two, and then I'll have him stop. The third is so graphic and brutal without the redemptive features of the first two that it's not worth the time. Truly a disappointing ending to a great series.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This game will prove that you do not know it all. Many times I came up just one move short of a designated number of moves and swear that there can't be another, and I was proven wrong. Great game for deep thinking and relaxing. Don't play this game if your life is full of interruptions, then you'll be frustrated - you been warned!!!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|It is the best app I've ever downloaded! Recommended to everyone! I now can easily read the Bible anytime and anywhere on my finger tips!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is an incredibly violent book, but I still really liked it. The characters were dramatic, the scenarios plausible and terrifying. It's just a really good sci-fi novel. The next two books didn't impress me, but this one was definitely worth it.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|So I have to admit I read almost all of the reviews before buying a book for my kindle. I was recommended Beautiful Disaster from a friend so I read the reviews. Well there were both positive and negative, so I tried a sample and read the first chapter. I can't put it down! You are curious by Abby's past and intrigued by Travis. If you do not like strong language, don't bother. But if by then you are so wrapped up in the characters, this is for you! I loveeeeeeee it!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|you seriously. don't.need a radar if you really need one don't be so lazy and check aa computer. heed people
B002ZG976U|5.0|I loved this movie!  Great dancing, beautiful women, great singing by both Aguilera and Cher, and a good love story.  The critics have this one all wrong.  I usually don't listen to critics anyway.  Listen to the opinions of movie-goers.  They loved it, just like me.  Like typewriters and land-phones, critics will soon be dinosaurs of the past.  Why listen to one or two pretentious nerds when you can get hundreds of reviews with overall ratings from real movie-goers on internet sites like this?
B004MC8CA2|4.0|Alot of apps say user friendly.  But then when go into its &quot;settings&quot;,  it turns into a headache.  This one actually is &quot;user friendly&quot;. Great app.
B006MHWXMS|2.0|My main issue with this app was not whether it worked for me or not, but that it left behind a hidden folder on my device even after I deleted it. I found it on my SD card only because I was using a third-party application to clean up my internal memory. Not a huge deal because it wasn't taking up too much space, and it was easy to delete, but I found it annoying. Especially because the folder was labeled \\"TNT\\", so it took me a while to figure out which app it was related to.
B0054JZC6E|1.0|I like this game because it has a lot of fun stuff but I gave it two stars because the uptate is stupid it deleted everything I had and it took me like a week to finish two whole pages and then, gone I was mad
B006DRVFRQ|2.0|I deleted gReader along with most of my apps on my Kindle Fire due to its limited internal memory. I was dismayed to find that when I located a hidden folder that it left behind on my SD card, it refused to be deleted. I am using AndroXplorer and ES File to uncover remnants of deleted apps such as gReader.<br /><br />Actually, when I tried to delete the hidden folder, it froze up AndroXplorer and and it perpetually stalled the process for ES File.<br /><br />Otherwise, the app itself was brilliant. Woulda kept it but for the low SD space issue. Plus, I had become ingratiated with Pulse, which features pictures and fat finger-friendly user interface. If gReader had been preinstalled, I probably would have preferred it to Pulse.
0553801473|1.0|The series began well and become worse.  The book should have been titled \\"Book 5 - The Quest For More Cash\\". It lacked pace, contained some errors but above it all lacked resolution. That intimate conspiracy that a good author forms with his/her readers was ignored or at least compromised - almost like writing by numbers.  It is a clumsy reworking of the dregs and I'd suggest saving your money. Martin is no Tolkien and needs a better editor. I have no wish to volunteer for the task.<br /><br />Dr Steve Benson
B004X80QNG|3.0|I am only reviewing this app because it left behind a hidden folder after I deleted it from my device. I absolutely loved the user interface, but my Kindle Fire was complaining about not having enough internal memory. I still haven't found where all the memory is being used, but it was mildly annoying to find that several apps had left behind neglible traces of themselves on my SD card. Most of the apps that did this, I gave 2 stars. But I REALLY LIKED the colors in this app. So pretty.  I'm sticking with ToDo Task Manager Pro, though, because it takes up less space overall, and because of its robust reminders. Goodbye, pretty app! Thanks for the FAOTD goodtimes, Amazon!
B003Y5H5HO|3.0|Although David Fincher's English-speaking remake is a superior film as cinema,the original made-for-TV Swedish film was rougher,more ragged,closer to the bone,the characters more threatened.The remake in Sweden stays true to the source,but has the jarring note of all the characters apart from Craig(Blomkvist) speaking with a Swedish accent. Rooney Mara captures a complexity of character-vulnerable,unhinged,sexy, detached,steely and feminine,losing the spikey brittleness and demonic energy of the original.This tale of rape-revenge as well as political thriller exposing Sweden's hidden history of fascism is superbly directed, smoothing out kinks and convolutions in the plot, streamlining the narrative,reducing psychology to data. When Salander, in a scene very late in the film, tells Blomkvist about her early life,it registers neither as a \\"revealing moment\\" nor as a glimpse into her \\"motivation,\\" but as another datum.The opening credits a petrol-dripping kaleidoscope of bodies,flowers,keyboards,dragons to Led Zeppelin's `Immigrant Song', mimicing a James Bond opening,with Blomkvist played by the current Bond.But this new man is ultimately saved by Salander,who outclasses and dominates him.  At times the story seems on auto-pilot; the result is slick,funereally chilly:a movie about an investigativeprocess rather than a crime.In the Oplev version(2009),characters are uneasy,less confident, emotions are closer to the surface.Some heartfulness has been flushed out with the bathwater in Fincher's version despite Mara's fresh take on Salander.In Oplev's film we had the original(subtitled) Swedish and it captured the pulpy spirit of the bookbetter. In Fincher's film the cinematography and editing are excellent as are Trent Reznor's and Atticus Ros's score,a tissue of connective membrane for the dramatic information.We also get a superb cast of back-up actors: Plummer, Wright,Skarsgard,Berkoff,James and Richardson. In this film more than the original, the stories of Mikael and Lisbeth are kept separate for an extended period. We learn about the girl's state-appointed guardian (Yorick van Wageningen), who abused her, stole from her and terrorized her.Her attempts to avenge herself would make a movie of their own.When the two meet an hour in we are fully primed up as to their combined motivation,to identify the serial killer,as lovers.  Fincher and his team do a good job of setting out an intriguing story. Fincher has a distinct visual sensibility and a good sense of pacing, and the film derives much of its momentum from Mikael's sleuthing into the lives of the Vangers and Lisbeth's high-tech hacking, which passes the smell test more easily here than it did in Arden Oplev's version.We live vicariously through the two idealised central characters in a wish-fulfilment fantasy disguised as thriller.The irony is that of the two versions I prefer the awkward sincerity of the original.If you see subtitles, never ask for your money back!The original got there first.Here Mara is the elf at Christmas,Rapace the kabuki-demon.
B004VMUS9G|2.0|I wasn't going to review this until, after I deleted the app from my Kindle Fire device, I found a hidden folder it left behind on my SD card. That means that I needed to use a third party application like AndroXplorer or ES File to manually delete it. I generally don't like the idea of apps leaving behind unnecessary clutter, even if the amount of data was nothing or negligible. That said, at least it was easily removed.  Honestly, I barely used the app and soon realized that I have enough alarms on my mobile phone and wristwatch alone.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Some of the games are weird but some are fun, and it does provide a lot of entertainment. It can be addicting.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its fun and all but id love if the games had a clear purpose. its more so a game to unlock games. recommended overall
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|it was beter than  fruit ul ninja!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! i love it gkdhggjzh fjsyhfkdh shshfjfh sdggdh dghdhgg djghjfhjf fkfhfffg dhfdjhr y @
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love the easy movement of the cards! A great way to entertain yourself in the quiet moments of your day!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|This was probably my least favorite book of the series.  I got the impression that Collins was tired of the characters and just wanted to be done. I was disappointed because I absolutely loved the first, but felt the series went downhill.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I've tried a lot of different keyboards including swype,  slideit, etc and keep coming back to SwiftKey.  It does such a great job of predicting what you want to type that its just faster and more accurate for me.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|App with lots of fun, addicting games. Master them to unlock more. Play often and get bonus points. One of the better free game apps.
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|I found this episode much easier to control on my Kindle Fire than the original Angry Birds, although I wish there was an option to flip the screen sideways for us right handed people.  Targets seem to be much easier to hit and there is less \\"pure luck\\" required to complete levels.  However, when I first installed it I had to run it 3 times to get the game to start, the first two times it locked up and I had to force close it.  This still happens occasionally when I start the game.  Also, it will sometimes simply terminate with no warning, taking me back to my tablet's home page.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|you can play many, many games for free I have been playing hours at times it is my favorite game in the world.
B004LWZW7Y|5.0|This is a delightful fun-filled film. The 3D effects are good although not startling; we do not feel the need to duck, but we can enjoy the feeling of depth. The story in the film is not the same as the classic tale, but is a clever and entertaining amalgamation of characters from various dissimilar stories, such as Jack and Jill, Jack and the Beanstalk, Humpty Dumpty, and others. I viewed the film with some three hundred people, virtually all of whom were adults, and at the film's end many of them clapped.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Very addictive, somewhat challenging too. I find myself thinking about it later in the day if I cant seem to beat a game
B0054JZC6E|5.0|fun, good for people who want an app to pass time and like to beat and unlock games. worth it overall.. its free anyway!
B0063IH60K|3.0|Great game but sure could go without the ads. I would rate a 5 if could get rid of ads.  I still play all the time though.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is good not great, I like the variety of games but some of the games are not so responsive, might do better on a phone
B0067R0APK|5.0|I live in Oklahoma and you need a good weather app. in case all else fails and this little app. fits the bill, vary nice looking to boot. I live in a vary small town yet it provides all the weather actions I could ask for, temperature, wind chill, wind direction, 7 day out look, radar, video weather news, and even moon phases. This app. works like a charm on my KF and i'm glad I bought it and i'm sure you will to.
B0051XJ9YE|5.0|My grandson is just barely 2, but loves CARS.  Knows all the characters names, knows the role they play in the movie.  He lines them up, drives them around, talks the talk, I love to watch him play with his CARS characters.  Found some hard-to-find members of the cast!  Thanks!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is so so so so dope Lol haha so what ya'll think bout that nukkas and by the way I'm getting paid to do this haha
B005HSL626|1.0|Fun game but made so the gross ads are too easily clicked on.  Would be a 3 1/2 star review without those naughty ads.  I'm uninstalling.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|First off the price was awesome! Inside I couldn't be happier with all of the space, it holds all of my equipment plus room to spare. Was scared because 1 review said the straps weren't very sturdy but I've taken this thing with me everywhere and haven't had any problems at all, and I keep it pretty full so its heavy, all I can say is maybe they got a faulty bag. Overall you couldn't ask for a better bag with this price! I highly recommend:)
B0052VUNHC|5.0|where to begin....I did like the book. I find myself often thinking about it long after I've read it. So for that I'd say it was a good book. But I had some issues with the male main character. He's very possessive and sort of abusive, but that is intended. I would hate for young girls to think this is how \\"love\\" is suppose to be, but I'm assuming most people know that. In the end, I enjoyed the story and couldn't put it down!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|it really is a cool app. its great for long trips and slow days since it doesn't need Internet. all in all I love it :)
0843175028|5.0|My 4 and 7 year olds love the Mr. Men and Little Miss books that I grew up with as a child. These storys are fun with a great lesson to be learned in each one.  A childrens classic!
B0063IH60K|5.0|A very fun and addicting game that doesn't require too much brainpower.  Both my Mom and I really enjoy playing!
B0063IH60K|4.0|I love this game..its a great time waster and stress relieved. I suggest it to everyone who has a kindle fire
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love the ability to download different translations.  Reading plans are a great motivator.  and the email &quot;nags&quot; remind me to get back on plan!
1439181780|1.0|I ordered this book and never got it. I tried to contact the seller and never got a reply. I am very upset because i never even got my money back. Im very short on cash right now and that was one of the only things i got for my mom. Very upset.... And if i dont get my money back or get the book then i will never shop off Amazon again.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|If you just want a game, don't get it. If you just want to waste time, it's great! Perfect for the ocd among us.
B004L35GAQ|5.0|good product, good price, good timing.  Thanx! I don't really have anything else to say, but it says I have to.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|this is a very fun and entertaining game also an actual challenge when you get to the higher levels. would recommend this game to anyone looking to kill time and have fun doing it
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this set of games intertwine me for hours while in class or sitting around in deal time between classes. I would regimens this game to anyone.
B0058VW36U|5.0|OmNom is so cute I can't stand his sad face and I love his face when he gets his candy!!!!!!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is actually a good game... it has lots of things to do and has kept me entertained me during car rides and during study hall
B0052VUNHC|5.0|I can't even begin to describe how amazing this book was. McGuire's writing just sucked me right in from the beginning and I loved the characters. Travis and Abby are so crazy about each other and even though they fight or laugh and go throw every emotion that you can go through when your with someone they are always drawn to each other. At times I wanted to throw this book and not read it simply because I didnt want to see what happened next in case it turned bad but I had to finish it!  Apart from the great story line and pages of chaos and love the book does have a few spelling errors through out it, but it's never a big deal. I found the book quite long as well, especially in the beginning when I thought that once they had found each other the rest of the book would be filled with just love, which btw it was but only because Travis and Abby go through hell with each other.  All in all it's an awesome book and I would definately purchase more books by the this author: D
1439190275|3.0|The information is all interesting but I am unsure if I would be successful at this diet. I think at this time I would rather try the Dash Diet.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|the game starts out with only a few games, but don't get disappointed,  you will quickly unlock more. the descriptions are accurate and gameplay is fun. and the price can't be beat!
B004EBUXSA|5.0|(using in a Hackintosh)  I was really worried when I opened the box to find what looked like a low profile heat sink and Fan.  I mean, half the size of anything I've seen on an Intel chip before.  I have been sticking my hand near the heat sink and I can't feel any heat coming off of it.  It has to be the coolest processor I've ever had!  It's also super quite.  It has inspired me to keep the 3.5\\" HDD's out of my case and I'm going to skip the video card and have a really quiet machine this time.  I just got done selling my i7 950 and switching over to this one to build a hackintosh.  I can tell the difference already.  Not much more I can say.  I don't know too much more about CPU's really...  I chose the i7 just to future proof it.  ? I dunno?
B0054JZC6E|1.0|the games all suck, there is seriously something wrong with anyone who actually enjoys these games. the concept of earning more games is ok but this particular set is horrible.
B00005J6UP|2.0|My husband watched this movie when he was a kid. He enjoys watching it till this day. He introduce me to this movie. I watch it with him, but I really don't care for it. It is interesting in the beginning. Some parts of the middle of the movie is ok. But when they get to the ship I think it get's boring.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is really fun I am not fey far into it but its very fun and itsvay just the right legal and chalenge
B005I6EU7U|5.0|I ordered this cover for my kindle fire and I love it. In response to those who say the cover doesn't fit and the top stands out above the Kindle, this is not due to the cover being too small but rather because it needs broken in a little. Just give it a day or two and it will lay flat just like a book. If you want to spend this process just work the binding area by rolling it. The straps are tight but i like that because I don't my $200 Kindle to even have a chance to fall out. All in all a great looking cover that will not only protect your Kindle but will also give it a classic look. Would recommend to anyone.
B006II7SGW|5.0|We watched this on our LG 3D TV in both 2D and 3D and the 3D was just stunning.  Very beautiful scenes in 3D, far better than the 2D.
B0034G4OVS|1.0|Buy the air freshener because the movie will stink the joint up! Quite possibly the worst film ever made. To quote a much better movie, I've seen better film on teeth. If you think about watching this wretched thing, take some knitting needles to your eyes instead. More painful, yes, but much more entertaining. peeee-yuuu!
B000006NUW|5.0|This item has many hit songs from the motown era. The item was shipped as soon as I ordered it and I received it very fast. Excellent transaction. Great songs by great singers. Recommend it to all who like motown music.
1609611543|5.0|The book was in excellent condition, arriving in record-time.  It was the only copy available at the time and I was happy to receive it.
B001DJ7PMI|5.0|Excellent Movie.. not available in Australia on DVD or Blu-Ray.. just wish I could play the U.S. Blu Ray here in Australia coz I would have ordered the BD instead. Anyway, if you haven't seen this movie, it's a little long but worth the time.
092389165X|5.0|Reading this years ago sent shivers down my spine as I was trying to put myself in the shoes of the bomb victims. My mind just can't grasp what those people went through. Highly recommend this book. Wish I could give it more stars.
0425220931|5.0|This book has changed my music  and life more than any other.  All musicians would get a lot out of the book. It is one of a kind, and really great !!!!!
0439023513|3.0|After reading the first two books, which were amazing, this book was such a let down. I felt like she rushed it and focused so much on the brutality of war that she forgot about katniss and peeta. I felt so deflated after reading this book, I sincerely hope that when they make the movie for this novel that the producers will put a better spin on it. One of the few times that I think a movie has the possibility to do a better job than this book. I really really wish she would re-write it. Here's hoping.
B000001E3V|5.0|While sitting in a sushi shop the other day I had the opportunity to listen to this remixed album for an hour or so. I sat mesmerized by the overall sound, mainly because I had heard this record once back in college (and loved every minute of it), but something about this new edition really stood out for me.<br /><br />Eric is forward in the mix. In the past this record had balanced the four members of the group where Clapton was little more than another voice in the chorus. But now the Dominoes have their front man back up front again, and it makes a big difference in terms of the performance. Clapton isn't merely a wicked guitarist, he's also a pretty good singer, and that comes through quite strongly.

B003L77GRO|5.0|I had seen Dexter a couple of times on SHOWTIME, but I really did not pay that much attention to it. Well, I was laid up for a few months and wanted something to fill my boring soap opera plagued afternoons. One day I told my sister to go to the video store and rent me something with a bit of excitement to it; she brought me back Season 1 of Dexter. Well let me tell you, I watched the entire season in two days and then I sent her to the local Best Buy to purchase all the Seasons available, including Season 1. I am hooked. The only bad thing about watching so many episodes one right after the other is that when you come to the end (which I did in Season 4) it is like you have lost your entire family. You come to know these characters as if you have spent your entire life with them. I now own all the Seasons and cannot wait for the release of Season 6 on DVD and the start of Season 7 on Showtime. If it were not for VOD through my cable service provider and programs like Dexter, Grey's Anatomy, the Tudors, Desperate Housewives, and The Borgia's I would not even subscribe to the premium channels that I have.  I switched from HBO to SHOWTIME when Season 4 of TRUE BLOOD ended. It resurfaces in June and Dexter some time in September 2012. I guess I will have to bounce back and forth between HBO and SHOWTIME until these two GREAT shows end their run(which I hope never happens). It is strange how you can come to love Vampires, Werewolves, and certain Serial Killers. With Dexter, I don't consider him your run of the mill serial killer, he is just the garbage man taking out the TRASH!

B003UESJH4|5.0|What a remarkable movie. I know I've always wondered what went onto behind the scenes in the lives of royalty and the King's Speech gives us a wonderful view. It's said in legends that a wounded hero is the only one who can save us, and that's exactly what happened during WWII with King George IV, or Bertie as his family called him, and Lionel Logue, a speech therapist.<br /><br />The King's Speech: Road to the Throne, tells the story of King George the IV, who must take over the throne because Edward VIII wants to marry Wallas Simpson, which would render him ineligible to rule. Considering how courageous Bertie was in first overcoming his stuttering, and then going on to lead England through a vicious war, I think Wallas did the English people a favor. From what I saw of the movie, Edward appeared to a mean-spirited man, more interested in his creature comforts than anything else. One might speculate that he uses his infatuation with Wallas to get out of doing the work of being a king.<br /><br />This is the story of the friendship between two men, and how a fraud saved a country. Lionel didn't have the degree it was assumed he had, but to his credit, he never claimed to be a doctor. What he did claim was that he could help Bertie and he did. Lionel probably gave Bertie the first unconditional he'd ever had in his life. I don't begin to know what might cause stuttering, but I do know that Edward's constant teasing of his little brother's affliction couldn't have made it any better.<br /><br />The movie shows us what it was like for Bertie as a man, to be afflicted with the one thing that he can't have, if he wants to give courage to his nation during war times. Lionel gives Bertie the courage to reach beyond his fear, and to rise up in order to save his nation, to show the most important role a ruler must live, and that's to give his people a role model when they've lost heart.<br /><br />As a movie, both the role of Bertie, played by Colin Firth, and the role of Lionel, played by Geoffry Rush, are played superbly. Firth brings such a vulnerability to Bertie, that to see him rise up to meet his challenges is wonderful. Rush plays Lionel with just the right combination of dignity and playfulness, skillfully walking the edge of innate brilliance and madness.<br /><br />It took me a while to see this movie because, frankly a story about a king with a stutter than the guy that fixes him, sounds boring the extreme. I'm so glad I took the time to watch it, and really only because of the awards and great reviews it received. It's a movie that stay with me for a long time.ionel, played by Geoffry Rush, are played superbly.

0465022227|5.0|There is a lot of knowledge and sources of information about a life in industry for an undergraduate/graduate. But there is little information for what to expect from a PhD. Also, conventional wisdom is often myth and unreliable. That is where this book comes in. Author talks about what to expect from a PhD, how to achieve the best from it and a lot of insight into decision making during the course of PhD. Well thought out, and well written - a quick and a must read for all related to PhD.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|I think it should be called Isreal missle defense system. but what a fun game almost maxed all levels but 1 fun wow
B0063IH60K|4.0|A solid Klondike solitaire app. Easy to use and navigate the settings, but the adds before every game are a little annoying

B001NXDIMK|4.0|1st and 3rd seasons were excellent.  This year was good.  It is worth viewing as it ties some lose ends from the first season.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|The games themselves aren't bad but getting points to do anything is hard. good way to pass the time though.
1416955070|3.0|I just finshed book one in this series, City of Bones. I found myself really struggling to get into it. However, about 2/3 into it, it started to get better. I found the writing style a bit strange and could have used some editing. I also didn't care for the incestual happenings, even though we didn't really know that's what was going on (I suspected it, however). I have the next two books already so I'll keep reading. Other reviewers compared this series to HP and LOTR, and I do not like either of those, so I hope this is better. Too much allegory tends to lose me. :)
B0015AARJI|5.0|Love the new controller, was not sure about buying it but was great decision since my son loves playing with a friend nor only online.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This game works extremely well on Motorola Blur 3G. The card action is very smooth. The game has enough scoring choices to make anyone happy. I learned to use a mouse almost twenty years ago playing Windows 3.1 solitaire, now I'm refining my touch screen prowess with this solitaire for android.
0385339089|2.0|There were a number of Grisham's earlier novels that I hadn't read and this past fall I made a point of addressing that by reading four of them, including The Client.  Some were better than others.  Not including some of the more recent Grisham novels (I've pretty much given up on him) The Client is one of my least favorite.<br /><br />Grisham is a good story teller and I am generally impressed with his character development.  I often find his novels though are longer than necessary and excessively mundane at times and I find myself wishing that his editors would trim at least a hundred pages from most of what he's written.  I also find Grisham tends to creates characters that are too clearly defined as good or bad.  Both of these complaints are showcased at their worst in The Client.  The plot here is thin and Grisham stretches it out for longer than I would have thought possible. And while the child protagonist in the novel is a little rough around the edges, he and his lawyer are bastions of goodness struggling against incompetence, corruption, and evil all around them.  It was all too `David and Goliath' for my tastes.<br /><br />To make matters worse, the young client in the novel talks like a wizened old man half the time.  I was never convinced that this kid was real.  The climax was a contrived effort to generate some measure of suspense.  Readers can expect little in the way of heart palpitations.  The last straw for me was the final pages of the novel which features a gratuitously sappy ending (there are few things I dislike more than a gratuitously sappy ending).<br /><br />The Client is at least 150 pages longer than it needed to be to support its thin plot, features unrealistic characters, offers little in the way of suspense, and has the subtly of a sledge hammer.  There isn't even the usual insight into the legal wrangling of a complicated court case.
B005WM6RUS|5.0|Sarah's Key  \\"Sarah's Key\\" by Tatiana de Rosnay describes the struggles of a ten-year old girl named Sarah. Sarah is taken with her parents by the French police during the Vel' d' Hiv roundup in Paris, July 1942. Sarah tries to save her younger brother by locking him in a bedroom cupboard. Sarah promised to come back for him as soon as she could. However, it took much more time than she expected. This led to a very tragic ending.  Sarah Starzynski, a girl born in France was brutally arrested by the French police. She was desperate to save her four-year-old brother Michel, so she locked him in the cupboard and kept the key. Sarah never gave up hope while in the concentration camps. Sarah always fought to escape the camps, and rescue her brother. She was a very hardworking and kind-hearted girl. While in the camps, Sarah regretted locking Michel in the cupboard. She always wondered if she would eventually be able to escape. When Sarah returned home, she was devastated with what she discovered. Her brother had passed away.  On the Vel' d' Hiv's sixtieth anniversary, Julia Jarmond, an American journalist, was asked to investigate the roundup. It is now the year of 2002 and Julia then learns all about Sarah's past life. As Julia investigates Sarah's life, she begins to question her own life. She begins to reevaluate her marriage and her romance. As Julia digs deeper and deeper into Sarah's life, she becomes very intrigued by her story. She begins to feel as if it is her mission to figure out what truly happened.    If you are looking for a dramatic and exciting book that you will never put down, this is your perfect choice. Sarah's Key includes a little romance and suspense, which makes it very intriguing. I would highly recommend this book to whoever is looking for an emotional and dramatic novel. If you are in middle or high school, this book will teach you a lot about the tragic history of France. This book is very educational, but at the same time it will have you sitting on the edge of your seat. I personally enjoyed this book very much, and am glad I had the chance to read such an inspiring novel.
0385339607|4.0|I find Grisham to be a hit and miss author, although lately he has been on such a losing streak that I've stopped reading his new novels altogether.  This one is a relative hit.  Rudy Baylor, in his final semester of law school is required as part of a class to provide free legal advice at a Senior Citizens home.  He meets an old lady who claims to have a fortune her family doesn't know about and she wants to cut them all out of her will and a woman whose son is dying of cancer when he could have been saved if their insurance provider hadn't refused to pay for a bone marrow transplant.  When Rudy's post-graduation job disappears due to a merger of law firms, these two clients are all he has.  The insurance case has the potential to result in a huge windfall for the fledgling lawyer, if he can win it.<br /><br />It's a standard David vs. Goliath tale, when Rudy, who is so green he has yet to write his bar exam, takes on the insurance company who denied medical services to his cancer patient client.  Like most of Grisham's novels the lines between good and bad are too clearly defined for my taste.  Yes, Rudy has some anger issues and he isn't perfect, but he's still a stereotypical, bright, idealistic, well intended young man taking on evil corporations and greedy Ivey League lawyers.  Personally I'd like to see Grisham exercise more subtlety. Do his bad guys need to be so bad?  Not only do they deny claims, but they do it arrogantly, systematically, and knowingly as matter of policy, and to make matters worse they sexually harass their employees, fire people without cause, and lie, cheat and steal at every turn.  They are so blatantly evil it never requires the reader to contemplate an ethical dilemma because the right answer is always so clear.<br /><br />But I digress.  This complaint can be made about almost all of Grisham's novels.  What makes this one better than many of his other novels is that while predicable, it's entertaining.  There are surprising touches of humor and as with many of Grisham's better novels, some insight into the world of legal wrangling.  Yes, there are some pretty neat coincidences that work in Rudy's favor but even a cynic like me can find satisfaction in the little guy bringing down a giant, even if it is contrived.<br /><br />I thought the romance angle however was weak.  Kelly was less a person and more a vehicle for Grisham to demonstrate Rudy's noble chivalry.  But so what I guess.  It allows our hero to ride off into the sunset with his best girl by his side, and who am I to question a formula that obviously works.  I was entertained and that's more than I can say for a lot of novels that I read.many of Grisham's better novels, some insight into the world of legal wrangling.

B0001L3LUE|5.0|This documentary is especially compelling for anyone who lived through the 1960s.  McNamara, after all, was the quintessential establishment man and one who had supreme self confidence.  The best modern-day comparable I can think of is Rumsfeld, though McNamara was a lot smarter and more subtle.  Can you imagine Rumsfeld telling all and being confessional in any respect?  The same holds true with McNamara -- which is why seeing him acknowledge mistakes and life lessons is so jarring.  Morris' camera technique, which prompts McNamara to look right into the lens, is a stroke of genius.  The pain in McNamara's eyes is what makes the movie entrancing, and makes one want to watch it again.<br /><br />McNamara acknowledges the evil of the fire bombing of Tokyo in which he participated as Curtis LeMay's aide, but defends the measure as necessary for doing the ultimate good of ending the war.  He deplores war, but is realistic enough to acknowledge its inevitability and gropes for rules to limit its incidence and effects.  His discussion of the Cuban Missile Crisis is chilling, and is confirmed by recent studies of archival material from the old Soviet Union.  The military pushed for a preemptive raid, and had Nixon won in 1960 that's exactly what we would have done.  But Kennedy's reluctance to do so is vindicated by evidence that Soviet field commanders had tactical nuclear weapons and the authority to launch them into the U.S. mainland.  The raid would have provoked World War III.  McNamara credits a former U.S. Ambassador to the U.S.S.R. for the famous decision to ignore Krushchev's second belligerent telex and respond to his first more accommodating message. McNamara deplores how close we came to nuclear war in the 1960s and acknowledges the simple chilling truth that very rational people are still capable of extraordinarily irrational acts.<br /><br />On Vietnam, McNamara portrays himself as advising Kennedy on the un-winnability of the war and the need to withdraw all advisors.  Kennedy agreed, though McNamara acknowledges that such a decision is always in flux and capable of revision given the politics at work.  He believes that Kennedy would never have escalated the way Johnson did.  But McNamara does not give any convincing explanation for why policmakers felt compelled to escalate and why he did not take better advantage of the resources that were deployed.  On this latter point, Westmoreland and his war of attrition methods have been the subject of much crticism, which Morris does not touch on in his interview.  Abrams, who replaced Westmoreland after McNamara left, followed a more viable policy of holding territory and building native support.  McNamara's defense that he was a \\"good soldier\\" following Johnson's escalation order does not address why he did not follow better methods in Vietnam.  This may have been McNamara's most egregious error.<br /><br />This is a great and compelling film.agreed, though McNamara acknowledges that such a decision is always in flux and capable of revision given the politics at work.

0440178002|5.0|I just finished reading this very long book. I get bored with books easily and most often don't end up finishing them. But this one was a page-turner! The characters were so in depth, the descriptions so vivid, and the story line extremely riveting. Indeed this is historical fiction worth reading! James Clavell is now my second favorite historical fiction author ever, James Michener remains my first favorite. Well done Mr. Clavell!
B0054JZC6E|2.0|I downloaded as the free ap of the day. The response was terrible on my Galaxy S. A few of the games couldn't be played at all because your finger blocks the view of what you are supposed to do.
B0063GORYU|5.0|This app is fun. Love it! Can play for hours... The interface is simply great. Would tell a friend. Totally worth checking out / downloading.
B001OQCV2E|1.0|This movie is nothing but politics. It attempts to make the following points:  -All fathers are terrible people  -Children should hate their biological fathers and love their stepfathers, regardless of circumstance  Did anybody else notice that the mixed Japanese/Caucasian family was given the meanest death scene? Being from a diverse family, I found that a particularly insulting message.
B001HN6922|5.0|Excellent movie and the kids love it is the only movie my 3 year old son wants to watch. Thanks.
0071762345|5.0|Dave Kerpen gets it! Wonderfully written book that is both knowledgeable and humorous. As a young professional diving into the social media industry, Likeable Social Media gave me tips and tools to learn the most valuable thing a brand can do: listen. This book is for all levels of social media involvement from the newbie to the self-proclaimed \\"guru.\\" You would be crazy not to read and RE-READ this book!
B005KXU83G|1.0|I'm afraid that I didn't pay attention when I selected this album for my wish list.  The price was right, but I don't like \\"live\\" music.  Too much interference with the songs!  If, I want the concert experience, I will go to the concert.  Mr. Seager puts on a great show, but I'd rather hear his songs from a studio now. That way you can hear every nuance of the voice. This is just my opinion, and I'm sure many people feel differently. Thanks.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|this app turns your smartphone and tablet into a 1-2 tactical study punch lol. I can make snapshots or voice notes using evernote on my iphone and they automatically sync to my kindle fire! at the sametime any notes I take on my tablet are always available on my phone!

B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love all the challanges within the games! it makes everything so much better and more fun! overall great app!!
B005XQLBU4|5.0|great app. highly recommended. Amazon has consistently delivered great free apps and this is one of them. a an the. a an the.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|this app isn't that bad after you get used to the simpleness of the mini games. it starts out getting games quickly then you get less games as you need more money
B0063IH60K|4.0|Four stars because there are ads between almost every game. Also there is no auto placement of the cards during the game. This option is only available after a win. Other than that, the app works well and has a nice selection of cards and backgrounds!
0674049160|4.0|This is a beautiful book with many interesting annotations.  The best thing (other than the novel itself) is the introduction.  Many of the notes are unnecessary, but many are informative.  My main complaint - and the reason I didn't give it 5 stars - was that there were too many places where I wanted more info and didn't get it.  That said, however, I think this is a wonderful addition to your Austen \\"collection\\".
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is really addictive. you will enjoy playing it though!you constantly stay intrigued the games range from puzzle to racing there is such a good variety of games to play on this app.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like getting a variety of games in one download. Some are a little repetative but not a bad little game for free. I wish more games were unlocked and the &quot;cost&quot; to unlock games is a bit steep.
B000FCJZUO|3.0|This book was somewhat hard to understand and get into. I felt as if it was a mess to be completely honest. I ended up skipping through most of the book just to see what happens at the end and be done with the book. I personally didn't like this story very much nor how the book was set it. I probably won't be buying from this author again.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is an efficient and effective way to get my time in the Word daily in my busy scheduled life. Thank you, YouVersion! I am now able to read and study while at work or wherever I might find myself with absolute faith and not a lot of baggage such as Bible, devotional books etc.
0792844882|5.0|This film is one of those great guilty pleasures that every once in awhile I have to indulge in! What's not to like, it takes you're mind off you're troubles, it's entertaining and trashy. Even with me being A woman I cant help but enjoy it! The nudity is appropriate and would'nt be the same without it.
B005XQLBU4|1.0|Graphics are lame and it gets boring really quickly.  I luckily got it free and it wasn't at all fun. Get this if you like to delete things.

B005XQLBU4|4.0|I have hours of fun with this game. I would say get this if u find yourself with time to kill.
B003L77GH4|5.0|I LOVE THIS SHOW. I can't say it enough. It really grew into something special towards the halfway point of the first season, and this season is just stellar.  Watch it from the beginning for sure, but definitely pick this up. It is one of few shows I have bought on DVD so I could watch it again, although I find it to be so darn memorable (unlike most shows on TV) that I can remember most of the episodes moment for moment, which is saying alot.  Buy this even if you don't necessarily love vampires. The characters, actors, storylines, and cliffhangers will have you sold! At it's heart, it is a story of a very intense love triangle and of the ups and downs of all kinds of relationships.  I am very picky and rarely dole out 5 stars, but this show and especially this season deserve it. Here's to it staying on the air a long while!!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game best in universe have to get NOW it shows u what five stars mean!!!!!!!!!!!! &lt;3&lt;3&lt;3 (3 hearts)
B003U80I5G|2.0|Jane Eyre, 2010 release, George C. Scott, Susannah York<br /><br />George C. Scott is my favorite Mr. Rochester, but this Jane Eyre release is bad. It is, however, the best of all releases so far, clocking in at 110 minutes as opposed to 99 minutes for several of the other DVDs of this film that are out there. If you are really craving GCS as Rochester, it's better than nothing, but only slightly. I am leaving this review of it here, as I think people should know what to expect before they buy. The print quality is extremely poor, very dark, and with vertical green lines showing up in three places. There are also some weird jumps in scene, but the thing I really damn this version for is that it is missing that speech Rochester makes to Jane about imagining there is a string that runs from his rib to hers, and that if she goes too far away he is afraid it will break and he \\"has the odd notion that he would take to bleeding internally\\". I don't think I am delusional when I say that I do remember George C. Scott saying those lines, and-- crapola!!!-- that scene is gone, gone, gone-ski. There is also one scene when Jane and Rochester are speaking by the fire that is so dark that you cannot see George C.'s face, and the camera is pointed straight at him because he is speaking. The bottom line is, I really hope there is an un-butchered print of this version of Jane Eyre out there somewhere, waiting to be found and remastered with a vengeance.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game it is so cool couse it has a game were.  are diving in a car. it is a alsome game
0061537969|4.0|Loved hearing a touching story from the dog's point of view. Our canine friends are so smart.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|I found this Bible to be great for reading the Bible via the large number of reading plans. There is a reading plan for just about any subject. Only issue that I see so far is that it needs Internet access.  Which can be problem sometimes.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I think it looks promising, but I'll write another update later. This is not compatable for my ipod, but for this device it's okay. Sent from my Kindle Fire.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app!it reads to my sister and has great devotions!!!! great Bible for FREE!!!bookmarks are easy to find too! get it.
0553386794|5.0|I will admit, I did not read this series until after watching the first episode of the HBO series.  I purchased the novel and could not put it down.  It was a compeling story without any of the romanticism of other fantasy tales.  Martin is unapologetic in his cynical views of the times for which this series is based and that is ultimately the strength of the book...it's hard hitting honesty.  Yes, morally, you may despise some of the characters, but that would be applying modern day morals to a time (and world) that did not have them.  This novel is definetly worth a read.
B005MTHRAA|3.0|The movie, \\"Medea\\" with Maria Callas as the title role, is a strange, even bizarre, take on the legend. Callas is beautifully photographed when she is present. She doesn't even appear until a lot of odd things go on featuring barbarian ritual practices. She is finally shown, just standing there, observing. I found the story hard to follow - what was in her mind, and what actually happened. It was edited badly I thought. I am a movie fan, and a Callas admirer, but this certainly was not in a league with her operatic performances, due to what I would deem bad directing. I'm glad that I finally saw the movie, but can understand why it never did very well.
B0054JZC6E|2.0|its ok I just think the games are for really bored people but there r a few cool ones but most of them r boring
B0036EH3U2|3.0|This is an amazing blu-ray box set with all of the seasons and additional movies included... However, The boxes themselves came damaged. The biding edges were rough and already looked like they have been opened and damaged from previous use. In addition, there were corners that were bent on each blu-ray season box.<br /><br />Overall... very poor quality packaging for a great tv series...
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The Hunger Games was a book that made me read it in one whole day.  It has the action of Harry Potter to the romance of Bracking Dawn. Every page I turned I did not know what would be on the other.  I just mean it is a page turnner.  What will be her new book...
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is one of the best games I have ever downloaded into my kindle fire, and I am extremely addictid to it.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it says right away that u have to work to unlock the games the point of unlocking the games is what makes it so much fun the games are very addicting with a huge variety so if you don't like one game there is 116 other ones to choose from plus the game is free and not only one game is free 117 games are free if you are looking for a game that includes variety, good graphics, and will keep you entertained for hours than this is definitely a good game to consider getting besides it is free!!
B005XQLBU4|5.0|I love this game. Takes me back to my Atari days as a kid. This generation will enjoy as much as ours did
B00004WX4U|5.0|My fiance introduced me to the wonderfullness that is Jeff Buckley! He's been obsessed with this album for some time now. Since I was buying him a [[ASIN:B002GYTPAE Audio Technica AT-LP60 Fully Automatic Belt Driven Turntable]] for Christmas, I had to buy him a record. What better record to buy than the one he is obsessed with?! This record was amazing! Sounds wonderful and plays great!! He loved his presents!! I would recommend this record to anyone!
B005K17RU0|4.0|Accuweather kept its end of the bargain by providing a solid weather app. There is often very little diversion from the inaccuracies of local forecast. I would go as far as to say that thus app does a better job than the locale weather man on average. Very pleased.
B0032KNA4I|5.0|This movie is pure fun, people, so lighten up! The special effects are AWESOME, and the best I've seen. It jawdropping, on the edge of your seat entertainment. I can't wait to see it again in Blu-ray!
B005IZLPKQ|5.0|After viewing various cheesy Captain America Movies throughout the decades, I am sure that this one was a breath of fresh air! I was about to give up and admit that Hollywood simply cannot release a decent Captain America movie but they finally done it! This movie is wonderful. It is well made, strong story, special effects and all the shebang! I have been collecting super hero comic books and movies since childhood (only DC and Marvel) and this one surely is one of my top picks. I strongly recommend this one to all the collectors out there.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|The product is great! It was in perfect condition when it arrived, and on time might I add! Just in time for Christmas! Also, it was the best price I could find! Thank you!!
B004EPZ07K|5.0|If you are super hero fan and a comic book and super hero movie collector, I strongly recommend for you to add this one to your collection. It is a good story, lots of special effects, tech work, computer animation, special tricks and explosive scenes. I only collect the top DC and Marvel comics and movies. This was surely one to collect. Go for it.
B005NKIQ26|3.0|I ordered it for my niece. It sat in the warehouse 3 or 4 days before it was shipped. At least it came before Christmas. My niece likes it very much.
B004LWZW42|5.0|This brings out the origin of the X Men and the real story behind the saga. It is an interesting history of characters and series. It is well produced and performed. This is a good item to collect. I strongly recommend it for the serious comic book and super hero movie collectors.
B0054N73EY|4.0|Many good songs on the CD. Some fine ballads and rockers. The Monarchy of roses is my favorite track. A seamless  transition considering the lead guitar player is new. Very good service as well.
B0034G4P80|5.0|This is one of the well produced super hero movies of all times. They have finally accepted and inputted in the plot that Thor is not a God but an Alien which Earth links assumed that he is a God! Same old Ancient Alien Theory is applied here. This is a great movie, lots of special effects and a wonderful story. I have been collecting comic books and super hero movies since childhood. I only collect top DC and Marvel material (no cheesy brand). This story surely got my attention and I truly enjoyed it. You will like it because it made sense of Thor's past, present and future.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|This game is simple and great. I could spend hours playing it especially on a long trip. its hard to stop once you start playing, you just want to see how far you can go.
B001E45XT4|4.0|I bought theses on Amazon a few weeks ago for about $30. However I would be more than happy to spend up to $50 for them. They are a great headset and they have great quality.  They are built quite nicely and I'm not scared about breaking them. They are made from what seems like a cheap plastic but I haven't broken them yet. They are also quite beautiful, the black and red looks great and the fact that the microphone can be placed out of your way and into the headset is a great feature!  The sound quality is also great the 40mm Drivers do their job and help you hear everything while gaming. You can play them at a level that is quiet and still be able to clearly hear footsteps and gun fire in great quality.  Altho they excel in gaming I might look into buying a different headset for music enjoyment and these don't seem to do the job for music.  As for the microphone, It's not as good as I had hoped. While it does broadcast my voice clearly and is way better than my old microphone it isn't 100% noise canceling. If you plan on using a microphone like this, you may want to use a push to talk or voice detection software so that you aren't broadcasting white noise over your microphone. I also sometimes notice that my friends say they can hear when I watch youtube videos. So there is some audio leakage with these. However the over ear style DOES noise cancel annoying backround noises like your barking dogs.  A great headset thats worth the money you pay!
B004EPZ07U|4.0|I considered not buying this movie because of the ultra-violet digital copy thing, but in the end, I really wanted the Blu-ray more than I cared about the digital copy and I also wanted to be able to see the extras on this disc, which I felt were worth the cost of the DVD (even though I paid quite a bit more for my copy than it's priced now). I'm also a big Green Lantern fan, and I wanted to own the movie.<br /><br />The movie was fun to watch. I felt like it was true to the character of Hal Jordan and the spirit of the Green Lantern comics as they have been written and illustrated for the past 50 years or so. I loved how the movie tied in different characters and stories that I remember from the comics and pulled them all into one big story. My family enjoyed the movie also. At the end, nobody was exclaiming that this movie was the most awesome movie ever or anything like that, but we all liked it. I'm looking forward to the sequels (and hoping that there will be sequels).<br /><br />I'm not an expert on DVD quality, but the Blu-ray looked fantastic on our HDTV. I loved the extras which have been detailed in other reviews.<br /><br />Summary: If you love Green Lantern, I think you'll like this movie. If you don't love Green Lantern, but keep an open mind, this movie is entertaining and a great introduction to the Green Lantern universe.<br /><br />I give this Blu-ray release only four stars because of the crappy, useless digital copy, and also because the movie itself could have been a bit better, though I really can't think of what I'd change about it and enjoyed it as it is.
B0000549B0|5.0|I got this for my mom she is so happy she was able to get it.  I have to say it brings back great memories of Sunday mornings watching the old movies with my parents.  Just great!
B004GYY714|5.0|What a great, easy to use app. I get all my local AM &amp; FM stations with clarity. Recommend this one for sure. Thanks!
B002LFPAUC|4.0|I have always liked Fawlty Towers so I bought this for my husband for Christmas. He didn't like it. However, I still do so I gave it four stars.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Other than some learning curve this product functions well.  Please update it to use connections other than WiFi so that I can use it with my unlimited 4G-LTE devices.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Great app, I can access my home and work computer while out and about. Very useful, as long as the computer is on with th program running you can access it
B0054JZC6E|5.0|keeps me occupied...fun &amp; entertaining....all the games are challenging but I have fun beating them over and over...don't need to download too many other games because this one is more than enough...:-)
B005I6EVUG|5.0|I love this cover, and the kindle fire that goes in it!  As everyone else says, I bought it at Best Buy, and I was concerned because the package didn't say for a kindle fire.  It fits perfectly snug, which is exactly what you want.  I agree that yes, if a strap busts, then the whole thing is done but that's all I have seen on the covers are the elastic straps.  This looks classy, and I love the red leather cover with some of the world's finest cities on it.  I knew I wanted a red cover, but I got a lot more than I bargained for!!  I took my plain black one back to Target and have been very happy with my purchase.  I love my kindle fire and am so proud of that decision because I debated back and forth between the barnes and noble tablet, and the kindle fire but the decision was out of my hands when I received the kindle fire as an unexpected gift.  My friend has the barnes and noble tablet, and just isn't as happy as I am!!  Thanks amazon!!  Great products!
B000JMLFLW|2.0|I am sorry, I know that this book is loved by millions and I should love it; but, I do not. I just could not get into it. It is so bland that I could not even finish. Thank the stars for cliff notes.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is great . i play this game all the time and now im addicted. everybody should have this game.
B004BLJQOK|2.0|The movie drags on. It's easy for the viewer to relate to Owen, the 12 year old boy. You hope he's able to overcome his fears and face the older boy that torments him. But Owen doesn't grow or go thru any character development. I felt the movie was not horrific, perhaps a little gory. There is not much of an arc in the story. I was disappointed. The movie is good only to kill time. \\"Cloverfield\\" was a weak movie as well, and apparently this is the same writer. There is something about American-made movies that looses a lot (of plot & storyline) when compared to it's international counterpart.
0525478817|5.0|I don't think it will ever be possible for me to read this book without crying. It is probably the best book I've ever read, and I feel privileged to have ever found it. Words can't describe how this book made me feel.
B003K1EYM6|5.0|This review is posted Jan 17th of 2012<br />I have a 1st gen iPad running IOS-5 and a Canon 20D.<br /><br />I read horror stories of people not being able to use this product with their iPads but only a few of them were clear as to which version of iPad and which camera they were attempting to use.<br />I also have seen many \\"knock-off\\" copies of the Apple Camera Connector Kit here on Amazon.<br /><br />First, let me praise Amazon.com as I'm a great fan of the site and admire the range and quality of their product offerings. That being said, I admit I bought my kit from Apple direct. I wanted to be able to challenge them with my reasonably high-end camera and my iPad should the kit not work.<br /><br />It works gloriously!<br /><br />I grabbed the first usb cable in my wire box and attached the 20D to the dongle and plugged it into the iPad. It worked without any messing around, downloading the 30-40 images on my camera without a single glitch or snag!<br /><br />I am a very happy person right now.<br />I have yet to fool around with syncing the images back to my computer and unless there's some hitch here I'm not aware of yet, there should be no problem.<br /><br />I shoot in RAW format without \\"Original decision data\\" so my images should be huge and intact when they make it to my desktop. If I run into any problems, I will update this review.<br /><br />Good luck out there and remember if you return from an outing with space in your memory cards, it was raining. :)<br /><br />Update: The [[ASIN:B004FK7V0S Sidekick LX 2009 PV300 Unlocked Phone with 3G, GPS and QWERTY Keyboard - US Warranty - Carbon Gray]] works with the Camera Connection Kit and the iPad 1st generation ( running iOS5 ). Not the fastest thing but works without any problems.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Great communication efficiency with a good mix of photos; audio and text; the audio is just incredible - clearly records and plays - quick loading.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Lots of fun games. Quickly play without spending days to the next level. Kid friendly, too! Well worth the time. Thanks
B005K17RU0|5.0|This app works great on fire.  I like being able to save and quickly switch between cities.  The forecast, alerts and other features are just what I was looking for.
B003Q6D1YW|2.0|The prmise of this \\"documentery\\" is falsehoods and deception in the modern social networking age. The film makers are supposedly dupped into believing in a young painter and her family over facebook. One actually begins an on-line relationship with the older sister of the young painter.  The premise is believable and events may have even stared as the filmakers document.  I cannot, however, believe the filmakers were that naive throughout the beginning of the film. Later, once they know they are being decieved, they conject on the nature of the deception. These turn out to be spot on. The actual discovery of the deception seems to be somewhat stagged or acted out. Maybe I am being jadded.  I'm writing this review being purposfully vague so you might watch the film and draw your own conclusions.  Bottom line is that I feel the film makers manipulated and edited the film to make it seem as dramatic and spontanious as possible(that's the filmskers job some would say...not in a documentary about deception says I). Something about the whole film does just not ring true with me. If you have some time to kill watch it and judge for yourself.
B0062NAVXA|5.0|Hubby and I went to see this movie and enjoyed it so much we talked several friends into going with us to see it again.  Even got one couple who NEVER go to the movies and they loved it.  Highly recommended.  It has some heartache in it but also some great humor.  It's also interesting to see how God can work things together and surprise us all.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|The latest update is TOO BIG.  The information says 9.1MB, but when I download, it is 25MB.  This is too big for my phone (LG Ally).  I had no problem with whatever version that I had prior to updating (was about 9.1MB).
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I told all my reading friend about this trilogy.  it is very entertaning and creative. I can't wait for the movie.
B004LWZW4W|4.0|This movie has been panned in a lot of circles and really I do not fully understand why.<br /><br />The overall story line is intriguing, while trying to find a cure for a very common disease, the apes being experimented upon have improved brain function.  One of those who gets saved from desctruction is a cute baby ape who grows into Ceasar.<br /><br />There are some touching elements, interesting where this one starts as well.  I will be intrigued by where it goes for the next round aka the sequel.  I felt the story line to be more compelling in some ways to the Planet of the Apes with Walberg, although I thought that movie had merit.<br /><br />Definitely worth a least a rental and even a purchase.  The Rise of the Planet of the Apes has some interesting twists, some excitement and is introducing the Planet to a whole new generation.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|a little tricky but fun to pass time. I like the different variety of games and having to unlock them to play new ones.
B001HN6922|4.0|Interesting to me is how it was stated that Lightning McQueen was somewhat absent in this movie, but I felt there was some very good balance.  This movie borrowed from the Bill Murray hit \\"The Man Who Knew Too Little\\" only here, Mater gets involved in some very interesting international intrigue, that involves McQueen, or rather a race he will become involved in.<br /><br />Great video and effects in Japan, Italy and England, I really like the part played by Michael Caine.  I was hoping that there was the cool ending in the trailers, however, the movie was well worth the look.  I will buy this somewhat later.  This is a fun video.  Mater is just a kick.
B000ELJBAK|5.0|The First track on this records reminds me early compositions by Joe Satriani. That's incredible, because Gilmour's LP was recorded on 1978, but many sounds, arrangements and styles of compositions by David G are very well written in a modern style. Simply. Excellent! This, and \\"On an Island\\": two of the best music of this guy, or the best material of soloist careers of Pink Floyd.
0375842209|5.0|This was an intense book. It took almost 50% before I was really interested and grabbed. I wasn't like I wanted to give up on it before then, but I was also not as driven to read it.  Plot aside, the writing style was really different. First of all, the narrator was death himself but it wasn't dark in that sense. He had an almost lighthearted sound. I felt I could write a paper on his use of colors to describe the world around him and his emotion.  Even more interesting about the writing, was the insane use of anthropomorphism. I can't remember specific examples, but it was so prevalent, that I could probably find it in any page of the book. Objects clearly had an emotional state and actions. It was pretty cool. Maybe a bit too much at times but that was rather rare.  As for the plot, there wasn't much but it was a character driven story anyway. I really felt for the characters and I could imagine knowing them for a long time. The author did a great job introducing you to each character without shoving his or her traits down your throat.  It was also interesting how you were told the ending many times and early on. And yet, I still cried when the inevitable came.  The epilogue could have used some work. It was clear where the protagonist went after her foster parents died, but what about Max. He survived and came back to see her but we don't know if they kept in touch. I would have liked some elaboration on that.  I gave it a 5, but I would really rather rank it a 4.5/5 (or 9/10) because of how long it took to grab me.
B0063IH60K|5.0|downloaded to my kindle fire and really enjoying it. Great graphics, good directions and fun features.  Highly recommend this app., definitely my devote rite
B004EPYZQC|4.0|Without  The Rock  then i would never buy this movie DVD. The Rock is number one action star of Hollywood so others are number two/2nd in this movie.  Best of  FAST...MOVIES.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Tons of little games to keep you occupied... my kids love to play this game as well. Not too hard or too easy.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Not the best game that I have played on Android, but it is up there. Good graphics, and solid mechanics
B006AZZPCM|5.0|I had been used freedi for youtube.  But recently I found tubemate which is way better than freedi!  Now I can get high quality youtube videos.  Really GREAT!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|great app.love the Bible.plans, although does.run very smooth at my church I get connection errors.but not.on.my home.network. overall a great app would reccomend
0738711500|3.0|It was an enjoyable read. The book is small and simple to use. The cards are interesting to look at, a little graphic for my taste though.  Had a little trouble relating to the book. It goes deeper than I wanted into the rituals, rules and ethics of tarot. If you want to start doing readings for customers and such, this book is for you.  If you just want to calm your curiousity about tarot and see what it is all about, [[ASIN:1578634083 Seventy-Eight Degrees of Wisdom: A Book of Tarot]] is a better book.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|Nice bible app. I have used it on my iPod, laptop and now my kindle. It is easy to use. I like having the option to download full texts for offline use. The only feature that would improve this app for me would be to have a &quot;Sermon /study&quot; note feature. One that would allow me to keep a listing of referenced passages while taking notes in the app (also to be able to easily switch  between sermon passages.) It would be great for cataloging passages and notes over topic or sermon titles.
B0001CNRSE|5.0|I loved the movie \\"Honey\\". I loved the dancing and the love story that was also a big part of the movie. Honey is a great lady who is able to hold on to her believes regardless of her mother's pushing her to do what she wants. Honey is a strong young woman with a big heart for people less fortunate than she is. So she gives dance lessons to the underprivileged youth in her own town. In doing so she realizes what is important most to her and finds a way to make it happen. Give yourself a treat and enjoy this movie as much as I did.
B005I6EU7U|4.0|I love this Kindle Fire cover! As soon as I saw it online I fell in love - I have the tan one. The price bummed me out, though. $40?!? A little too much, but I had a gift card so I snagged it right up! I love the softness of the leather as well, it's sooo soft! And the colors are lovely and it feels worth it. The only reason I gave this 4 out of 5 stars is because putting my Fire into the 4 holders was difficult, almost as if it didn't fit, and then the top doesn't sit closed on the Fire - it lays open a bit with a gap. I at first got a Nook cover for my fire since this was on back order for so long after I got it and it fit much better in the Nook cover. However, I'm vain and HAD to have a Kindle Fire cover for my Kindle Fire, not a Nook cover. That's my only stipulation, I adore the cover!
B000PMLFRA|1.0|So after some investigating I also finally realized you cant get the original theatrical versions on Blu-ray. Whatever reason lucas films has, or whoever it is that is robbing us, BOOOOOOOOOOO on you. I read somewhere they just dont want to invest the money in cleaning the original negatives, or possibly some originals were altered in making the special editions. What a nightmare.
B00004YLIU|5.0|There are plenty of other reviews out there to tell you how great this album is in digital form.  I'm only bothering to write a review because I think the Vinyl treatment of this album on two 10\\" LPs is worthy of comment.<br /><br />I picked this album up a month ago, and have given it half a dozen spins straight through on my Audio Technica turntable.  This is an essential album to listen to on vinyl.  First of all, they got everything right physically.  Heavyweight 10\\" LPs.  Heavyweight cardboard outer sleeve with two almost as heavyweight inner sleeves stylized in the same theme as the album cover.  Really a great looking package, just unsleeving the records is nearly as enjoyable as listening.<br /><br />The sound quality is also excellent.  I can't claim to be a real audiophile, but I've got my turntable hooked up properly to a 2-channel receiver with phono input, no cheap pre-amp adapters, and I've made a solid investment in my speakers.  And yeah, it sounds great.<br /><br />If Kid A is your favorite Radiohead album, as it is mine, you will not regret grabbing this up.
B0063IH60K|5.0|fun and relaxing. easy to use and play. features auto complete and winning hands. great deal for the price! love it.
B005M2A4DE|3.0|I (and my 6 year old daughter) love Doctor Who. While I am a huge fan of the David Tennant years, but this season I realized how much I like the Doctor - Amy - Rory trio. They are fantastic together.  I won't go on about the season and how much I like it - if you're interested you probably already have an idea that you'll like it.  What I will say is that I received this blu ray set as a gift for Christmas. Opened it up to watch it, and discovered an issue with the picture - it's almost a flickering of the image, as if someone off camera has a TV on that is reflecting and increasing the brightness in short bursts.  Called Amazon and got a replacement shipped. The replacement arrived and I immediately checked it out. Same flickering problem - when paused during a flickering \\"event\\", I discovered that the top half of the image was clear but that the bottom half of the image was more pixelated/fuzzy looking.  I opted to not receive a third as I had a strong feeling it would also have an issue, and the lady said she was going to block the inventory and pull it for QC review.  Fantastic series, hope it was just a bad batch, highly recommend it if they get good copies. The three star review is because I love Doctor Who and can't give it one star...which I would do for the sake of reviewing the Season 6 Blu Ray set that was defective. If I were to give the season itself a rating it would be five stars.  :)
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This a great app and love the fact i can read it offline on my kindle fire. You have to first download the Bible version u want before u can read it offline.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Evermore is perfect for capturing just about everything - inspirational quotes, notes to myself, etc.  The only downside is that on my kindle fire I can only save links instead of saving the text of a web page.  But O can save the link here, then to to my computer and sync Evernote then visit the links and on my computer I can clip the text of that page.
B000002V1D|5.0|I realized recently that this must be my favorite album (from any artist) of all time. This is probably the only album that I cannot get tired of listening to over and over again for about fifteen years now. Every listen feels like the first time! Nearly every track is a perfect blend of ear candy and intricacy. It's layered, bluesy, poppy, light yet complex all at the same time. Duran Duran are geniuses.
0439023513|4.0|People seem to be complaining on how the book ended.I think it was a great ending despite the epiloge . The epiloge should have told us more about Katniss and Peeta's life together. The way that Gale just vanished is beyond me. The author could have had one last thing about him instead of him dropping the bomb on prim and Katniss never mentioning him again.I knew that Katniss and Peeta would end up together because Gale had fire in him that Katniss had too and that woulnd't work out.So I think that the auther did a good job with last last book of the triology.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Some of the games are really challenging but most of them are untill you get the hang of it I especially like the sushi one!!!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love playing this game while passing time. The graphics are really nice too. A really good game to play on the Kindle Fire.
0670020478|5.0|Last minute purchase at Holiday time, amazon was true to their word and the book was received before Christmas Thanks
B0006J28MI|5.0|I purchased this and once again I received it before the date it was to arrive. It was well packaged and arrived damage free. It plays perfectly and I am very pleased with this product and Amazon as well. I give them another 10 for this one.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is amazing because when you get money you can pick what new game you want to play. this game is full of fun and funny mini games. I recommend down loading this game, plus its free!!!!!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Downloaded a couple weeks ago. Had a little trouble sliding the cards. Bought a stylus and it makes everything easier. Now the game is a lot easier to use.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|The games are totally awesome and kool. I like playing them myself. The one that I mostly like is the one where you have to keep a soccer ball up in the air. I love that game.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|This was an all around awesome book... with flaws. This book was too... jumpy? It went from this too that like... *snaps fingers* that. a good book, but too jumpy. 4/5
B0054JZC6E|2.0|ads are everywhere each time you do a game a ad pops up it is always trying to make you rate it or get a game.
B004VMVTNU|5.0|I use my phone as an alarm clock so I really needed an app that I could trust to get me up in the morning. So far this product has never let me down.  I really love being able to set an mp3 as my alarm and the crescendo feature starts the song out softly and slowly increases the volume, which keeps me from getting jolted out of bed. I've currently got it set to play \\"[[ASIN:B000TDWSYO Non, je ne regrette rien]]\\" by Edith Piaf (aka the song from Inception).  Only feature it's missing (wishlist):  A more advanced disable ahead of time. I'd really love to be able to set the alarm for every weekday except for a specific day next month (when there is a holiday for example). It can currently do a \\"skip next\\" but I need to remember to do it the day before. Since I don't know of anyone else who actually *has* a feature like that it's probably something I just need to learn to live without.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|graphics are a little dated but anything that will make my kids sit still for more than a couple minutes is worth it to me
B001E45XT4|4.0|I was looking for an affordable headset with decent sound and a microphone for movies and gaming. For the price, it's an excellent deal. They are very comfortable, with decent sound quality, and a microphone. I really like the velvet material around the ear cups and head cushion. My only complaint is they push against my glasses a little bit, but if I adjust the arms it's not too bad. Very satisfied with this purchase.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|very useful to write lyrics on the go and store whatever u want in seconds. def reccomend it to artists who need something other than a pen and paper to write with
B0063IH60K|4.0|Loads of fun.  Very easy to use.  Over all nice app.  It's a great game for the whole family to play.
B0060ZJ7BC|4.0|As mentioned by my title this is a good movie and a must see for baseball fans.  \\"Moneyball\\" chronicles the 2002 Oakland Athletics with their no-nonsense, savvy General Manager Billy Beane played by Brad Pitt,  A's manager Art Howe played by Phillip Seymour Hoffman. Jonah Hill also plays as Billy Beane's genius assistant Peter Brandt. The movie begins when the Oakland A's lose in the playoffs after the 2001 season, not to mention they also lose their two highest priced talented players Jason Giambi and Johnny Damon.  Since Oakland does not have the money the money to compete with the big boys(Yankees, Red Sox), Billy Beane must make do with players who weren't highly sought after.  Here's what the movie fails to mention the A's had offensive power hitter Miguel Tejada(won MVP in 2002), the A's also had 3 Cy Young caliber pitchers( Tim Hudson, Mark Mulder, Barry Zito) Zito won the Cy Young in 2002.  The movie makes no reference to them. The A's beat the odds and win 100 games in 2002 to make the playoffs.
B005NPLWYU|5.0|Extraordinary metal progressive!! The Band most interesting of the moment...a double vinyl with good packagink. Recomends to metal fans and prog fans.
B001JAFYFG|3.0|If you haven't seen this movie and you like good escapist science fiction, this is good for a hoot.  Special effects and miniatures are a little lame even by the standards of the the day when the movie was shot.  I got the movie for two reasons.  One, it was cheap and two it was a cheap Blu-ray.  I'd just gotten my first Blu-ray player for Christmas and wanted to try it out.  I also got 2001: A Space Odyssey and 2010: The Year We Make Contact in Blu-ray, also cheap.  And here is where I going to go into my review of Blu-ray, not the movies I purchased.  After I played these three movies, plus some newer ones that I rented, I've concluded that what little difference there is between standard DVD movies and Blu-ray movies isn't worth the fuss.  My standard DVD of The Bourne Identity looks just a crisp and clear as the Blu-ray version.  Granted, they can pack so much more onto a Blu-ray, and that may be worth the whoppla, but I fell asleep playing back all of the \\"backgrounders\\" on the Blu-ray disks there were so many.  The only thing that I can say for Blu-ray that I'm happy about personally is the fact that I shoot in HD and I can edit in HD and author my personal programs out to a Blu-ray and it looks incredible.  One last comment about Logan's Run, the movie.  The cinematographer should have over cranked the miniature camera for the city scenes so that the water moved in slow motion to keep it from looking like a miniature model of a city.
013168728X|1.0|I chose standard shipping, and it took nearly the entire 14 business days to arrive, but the real problem was the condition when it arrived. The product was advertised as hardcover but was actually paperback. The spine is dented and deformed in several places, and most of the pages had a small tear along the right hand side. Worst of all, the cover is almost completely unglued and coming off the spine.<br /><br />Also, I'm not sure if this is relevant, but be aware that this is an Indian reprint, not the American edition. As near as I can tell the content is the same, but it may affect where you can resell it when you're done.<br /><br />This was one of my first experiences buying books online. While I saved about $30 compared to buying it used at my campus bookstore, it'll end up costing me in the long run because I doubt anyplace will want to buy the book due to its condition.
B004LWZW4W|5.0|I bought this for my BF and thought I would hate it the movie itself but I actually really enjoyed it! It came ontime and well packaged would recommend this seller!
0307957934|4.0|As a retired financial adviser,I eagerly awaited the last novel from Robert Harris. Having read several of his earlier works, I wanted to see how he could work a hedge fund into a thriller. Although he did a fine job explaining some esoteric financial operations, the book was far more than a book on the world of high finance. Instead, he delivered a psychological thriller showing the disintegration of a hedge fund genius.  It took me a while to get into the story, but could not put it down at the end.  Very well done. Highly recommended.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I really enjoy the weekly or yearly plans that tackle different topics. Has a little something for everyone. Whether you are a Bible thumper or brand new to the book there is something for you.
0143039431|3.0|The difficult lives of the Joad family during the Great Depression of the 1930's are very relevant to the America of today. The transition of the 1930's economy in the Midwest to mechanization is similar to the current transitional economy in the U.S., where we are moving from manufacturing to more of a tech base. We are moving away from what we know to something we don't know, and people are not sure what to do or what to make of it.<br /><br />I have loved the Steinbeck books I have read up to this point (Travels With Charley, Of Mice and Men, Tortilla Flat, and Cannery Row), but Grapes is much too one sided for me. In typical Steinbeck fashion he puts you right into the story, but he paints with much too broad a brush here. It is slanted, and does not give equal time to both sides. The bad is too bad and the good is too good. Steinbeck seems to leave out a basic understanding of economics, perhaps intentionally, and I'm afraid lots of people just swallow the anti-corporate message without thinking. Some think companies are an unending fountain of money. They are not. Education is the problem, as it was then and continues to be.<br /><br />The Grapes of Wrath brought to light many things that needed changing in the United States of the 1930's, and for that I give it credit. Illegal monopolies, unfair labor practices, corrupt local officials, etc. are all effectively criticized here by Steinbeck. The immigrating Joads, as legal U.S. citizens, have rights as citizens which should be protected.<br /><br />The character of Al, one of the Joad's sons, is a bright spot. Al is changing and embracing the future by learning to work on cars, even after the mechanization has forced the Joads out of their sharecropped farm. The Great Depression forced people to move and to change, developing new skills as the economy changed. Al's forward-thinking adaptation made me wonder if the government relief mentioned in the book simply enables people to sit right where they are when things change and simply cash a government check each month, draining society instead of adapting to the change and contributing to the new economy in a positive way. I am afraid this type of thinking so prevalent in modern society is teaching people to become dependent on the government (in exchange for votes) instead of going out and making their own opportunities.<br /><br />While reading The Grapes of Wrath I lost patience with Steinbeck's rhetoric in which corporations and the wealthy got that way by unjustly taking advantage of others. Even small businesses (restaurants, stores, gas stations, etc.) in the book are treated with contempt. Small businesses create jobs. Large corporations create jobs. Individuals who gamble their family's security and future by starting their own businesses create jobs. These are positive forces in the economy. The Government taking money away from these positive forces is a drain, which must be justified in one way or another.<br /><br />At times the Joad family is starving, but they balk at working for wages they deem are too low. You do what you have to do however, and the Joads end up working and eating. Companies don't get ahead by cheating people for very long, and The Grapes of Wrath effectively illustrates the labor abuses of that time. Reforms were made and things eventually got better for the workers as well as for the economy as a whole. It is how the Free Market works, for better or worse. The real challenge lies in dealing with the transitional economy and figuring out how to prosper in it. It is a cycle, and The Grapes of Wrath is timely today because we are in that same type of economic cycle in the U.S. right now. Rather than looking to The Grapes of Wrath for answers, however, maybe we should look to it instead to learn from our past mistakes.government check each month, draining society instead of adapting to the change and contributing to the new economy in a positive way.

B0054JZC6E|4.0|there is a very large selection of games and some get berg addicting. others seem to be very simple and boring.
B000LTAY1U|5.0|Great automatic watch for the price. Looks very nice, is easy to set, fits well, and keeps good time. I would recommend it.
1451627289|5.0|Wonderful story. Makes you long for the \\"good old day's\\". Couldn't put it down, hated for it to end. And for us of the Kennedy and Nam generation it brings back lots of thoughts we probably buried for years.
B000641D2Y|5.0|Great movie and just as good as the first Home Alone movie. Very funny and a great watch at Christmas time. A great movie for family night and a good moral ending.
B001AVCFJM|5.0|This movie is just fun. It is a full-on action movie, but still contains light, funny moments and scenes where the characters show real emotion. I'm not sure how a die-hard Trekker would react to this film, but from what I do know about the original series they seemed to stay pretty true to what Star Trek is. Of course it has been modernized for today's audience, but I think that has only made it better. You do not have to be a Star Trek fan to enjoy this movie.  For people with kids: Being an action film there are fight sequences and people die, but it is not bloody or gruesome at all. There isn't any bad language, at least none that stood out. I would say it is similar to the movie Iron Man in terms of appropriateness.  The bonus features on this two-disc version are really good. I'm really into the bonus features, so this is important for me.  Lots of interviews and \\"how did they do that\\" type of stuff.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|fun and challenging game, not alot to it. but it is kinda addictive. cartoonish graphics but smooth and quick on samsung epic 4g.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I see some people are saying that it doesn't work on their fire ....works great on mine! I have all kinds of locations saved and I can click on each one and it goes right to their weather. Great app for planning....weather is accurate and it gives you a 15 day forecast which is great for the planning aspect.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I really love this app because of all of the challenges it gives. it excites me to play again and beat levels to get bee games!! so awesome!
B000W91RUG|5.0|Love this series! I usually dont watch TV series and if I do, they dont ever hold my attention for long. That being said, this show is fan-freggin-tastic! cant wait for season 5 to come out
B004EPZ06Q|5.0|This review is for the movie only. I do have the Blu-ray/DVD/Digital copy but i have not viewed it yet.Sorry for those that are having all the issues with the digital copy.I won't be using that so its just a throw away item for me.What i cant understand is all the hate this movie itself is getting on here and other sites.Was everyone in some sort of bad mood when they watched this or something?  Myself and everyone i viewed it with laughed hysterically throughout the entire thing.Sure the premise was basically the same as the first but what were you expecting,high drama?! What sequel isn't similar to the original? If it ain't broke you know.If it hadn't been similar people like myself would have probably been disappointed about that,so what are you going to do? But for those of you who have not seen this yet and enjoyed the first hangover do yourself a favor and watch this despite the bad reviews.HILARIOUS! Right there with the original if not better than. Now bring on number three!
B001FB4VXU|5.0|This show just keeps getting better. Character dev. is on point. It could use some more specail features but overall I'm more then happy. This season is pretty much my crack. At least I'm far from finishing....that would be bad..very bad.
B0064NTZJO|2.0|I went out to see this film with some family and friends, I went in knowing what kind of film it was and I thought I would like it. But I knew the people I was with only heard the word \\"Drive\\" and thought of action, heist, killing, etc. Normally I would enjoy films similar to this film that mixes drama and action in a sort of indie style or a style that most American audiences aren't used to. I watched the other film \\"Bronson\\" by this director after I watched \\"Drive\\". The director uses a lot of similar style and tricks, but that film was a character study and focused on their main character. \\"Drive\\" did not do the same. I will say that Drive is great to look at and and the sound was very good.<br /><br />So as we watched the film it started off well and from then it declines very slowly, and when I mean slowly this is a result of the two main actors Ryan Gosling and Carey Mulligan having a lot of interaction with each other and nearly no back and forth dialogue. This doesn't mean that nothing is said, Carey responds like a normal person most of the time and then Ryan's answer would be to just look at her, stare, and then smile.<br /><br />The only character I didn't like was Ryan Gosling's character because while the role may have required him to not speak as much, the movie shouldn't have tried to focus and draw out the relationship between two people that really don't communicate with each other. This is the biggest failure of the film is that when it is all said and done the film's focus is on the relationship between Ryan and Carey, with action becoming a part of the film at the end. The film at the one point changes tones so much that it leaves you confused.<br /><br />I will say to each their own when it comes to most things, this film was only rated a 2 star because the surrounding cast of characters did well. It looked very good and was filmed well, I did enjoy the sort of 80's synth soundtrack because it seemed to take me out of the dramatic points the film tried to focus on.<br /><br />I'll end with stating that if this movie had simply had some basic dialogue between the two main characters then it would've been passable and I would've actually been able to recommend it to people. But this is not the case, I am not the only person out there who felt that the lack of dialogue brings down the film. So when multiple people are pointing out the same issue in a movie that is critically praised like this film is, then it is up to the reader to decide which side they think they will fall on.with stating that if this movie had simply had some basic dialogue between the two main characters then it would've been passable and I would've actually been able to recommend it to people.

B000F3A7LE|5.0|After reading the preceding reviews and thinking frequently about this album that I had enjoyed so much (hard to believe!) twenty five years ago, I was still unprepared for the tremendous power and integrity of the music on this album. There is enormous creative and artistic depth and ingenuity in the tracks on this CD and the range of beautiful, powerful and thought-provoking music is just as enthralling to listen to now as it was when it was new.  My advice is to focus on the \\"third edition\\" recordings, which seem to have more sonic depth and fullness.  But the combination of tracks is truly a great artistic achievement and one that will repay many listenings.  The alternate takes reveal fascinating variations on these compositions and overall provide interesting insights into the music and the performers.  The surprising contrasts between performances by Terre Roche and Daryl Hall of the same songs is revealing and interesting.  Overall one is left with the perception of Robert Fripp as a true artist and creator of a recording that has definitely stood the to of time.
0316098515|5.0|I've only recently purchased this cookbook, but so far I love it and have enjoyed everything I've made from it. Don't be intimidated by the negative reviews, this is a high-end cookbook, of course the recipes are complicated, that's what makes it fun and worth buying. Perhaps the negative reviewers should have spent their money on something from the Food Network. But if you like books like the French Laundry and Alinea, this is another book you should own.
B004QK5N5W|5.0|A nicely-designed adapter. Can charge while connected to HDMI cable. Works well with my 4th gen iPod Touch. Great for watching videos/movies. Very satisfied.
B005MYEQ4U|4.0|I love Woody Allen.  He has such a delightful way of crafting his comedic adventures into something so thoughtful and provoking, without ever feeling heavy handed or manipulative.  He allows his characters to speak for themselves and their situations to come alive within a realm of awkward realism.<br /><br />`Midnight in Paris' has many of the same qualities that make Allen's filmography so impressive, but it lacks some of the internalized charm I was hoping for.  The performances are mostly uniformly great, with a few standouts, and the overall feel to the film is certainly effervescent in the way that most `great' Woody Allen films are, but there is a filmy layer of forcefulness that I didn't expect nor did I truly love.  Instead of allowing us to take from this film what we needed to take from it, Allen told us what we needed to glean, thus taking a little away from the film's actual impact.<br /><br />In `Midnight in Paris', we are introduced to a young couple on the cusp of marriage.  They are drastically different individuals.  Inez is self-centered and condescending and materialistic and Gil is a dreamer with his head in the clouds and his eyes set on a fantasy idea of what life should be like.  Inez and Gil accompany Inez's parents to Paris for a business venture.  Inez is more concerned with eating at posh restaurants and buying overly priced lawn furniture, while Gil just wants to soak in the beauty of the city.  Gil is obsessed with the past, the nostalgic feeling of a time lost to him because he is simply not content with what he has.  He is convinced that yesteryear was so much better than the time and place he dwells in now.  While spending time alone, the clock strikes midnight and Gil finds himself transporter to 1920's Paris, a time he often fantasized about living in, where he meets the likes of Fitzgerald and Hemingway and soon falls for a beautiful woman who has a thing for tortured artists.  Living in this fantasy deep into the early morning hours and then struggling to connect with his fianc&eacute;e during the day, Gil uncovers the truth about his wanderlust and begins to understand his relationship with Inez for what it really is.<br /><br />A mess.<br /><br />The acting is pretty good.  Owen Wilson basically plays Woody Allen and he does so with mixed results.  His soliloquys are somewhat misdirected and feel awkward, and not in the comedic way that Woody pulls them off, but he really captures the awestruck feelings thrust upon Gil.  Rachel McAdams plays a pretty horrible person, and she does so with a finesse was wasn't expecting.  Michael Sheen is a clich&eacute; and not as funny as I wanted him to be.  Marion Cotillard is mesmerizing as the alluring love interest for Gil, but it is Corey Stoll who steals the whole show as the boozing, self-obsessed, prolific Earnest Hemingway.<br /><br />My issues with `Midnight in Paris' lay with the script, which is surprising since it's Woody Allen and it's been winning award after award.  The script pushes Gil's personal views in a way that are consuming.  It is the only viewpoint expressed and it is done so rather heavy handed like.  The other thing that bothered me was that everyone in Gil's life was so different than him, so awful and unlikable that it made zero sense that he was even living the life he was living.  How did he end up with these people when he hates them and they obviously abuse him too often?  I also found parts of the film lazy, especially when you consider how Gil comes across a certain diary.<br /><br />Alas, Woody still knows how to create an air that is engulfing, and his recreation of 1920's Paris is charming to the hilt.  Whenever Gil is dwelling in that world, `Midnight in Paris' is a total keeper.  This just feels like two films trying to live cohesively, and it can't wholly.ing to connect with his fiancée during the day, Gil uncovers the truth about his wanderlust and begins to understand his relationship with Inez for what it really is.

0743216385|5.0|As a vet of the 101st Airborne myself (40+ years after these guys), I have read a lot of material on the airborne infantry and WWII. This is one of the finest books I have read in either category. Rather than a newsreel history account, it comes from the point of view of the soldiers through Ambrose's thorough first-hand accounting of journals, letters and troop interviews. If you loved the mini-series you will enjoy the book even more.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|great app! I love that you can listen to your daily bible reading. I also like being able to set up a plan for the year.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|not a bad game found it a lot of fun and good challenge. similar to the old missle defense arcade game but with some upgrade twists built in...better played on a tablet
0486219577|4.0|True, there is an abundance of flourished birds as examples in this book, but each one is beautifully done... The designs are all different examples of how TO flourish something, whether it be a bird or not.  The bird is taken into account so much due to it's excellent curvature for practicing with the pen and because the quill pen itself was so important, historically, as the book describes.  A lot of the prints are so beautifully ornate that you have to take a good look to even see if there is a bird.  But it does offer simple exercise instruction and tips, examples with lettering and such.  I do not regret adding this book to my library.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Very enjoyable and fun to play. Will look forward to any updates comlng out in the future. Would have bought this game.
B003297I1U|5.0|This Bruder Crane is so detailed and sturdy. Perfect for boys of almost any age. Has many different functions to play with.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|some games are fun, some controls need improved on other games, but the price is right and there is definitely a lot of variety.
0307959856|5.0|This book was a Christmas gift for my daughter and arrived in pleanty of time and at a very reasonable price. I have not yet read it but am looking forward to doing so as we both are huge Pride & Predjudice fans.
B000WQWPKA|5.0|Everything  the explosions, the flights , the aliens looked so much more brilliant and clear in bluray. The sound was so clear like being at the theater.
B005CMSDKA|5.0|I think the unusual european style and limited marketing hurt this film at the box office.  It was easily the best, smartest action film of 2011.  I don't buy many movies but this was a must-have. Excellent cast, acted, and some amazing cinematography from a director more known for costume dramas.  Saoirse Ronan is amazing at making this unusual character come to life, and the action she is involved with is more believable than similar 'small girl beats up guys' movies like the Thai boxing film 'Chocolate'.  The subway fistfight scene with Eric Bana is an amazing single edit tracking shot, I could watch it repeatedly.
B000002UD7|5.0|This CD is a compilation of ten (10) PSB songs that are among their better work. If you enjoy PSB's music, this is a good addition to your collection!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|awesomely fun with all the free and pretty fun games on this app. no.problem at all with this app. plus good free rec
B000HF2NF8|5.0|Bought this as a Christmas gift for my daughter. Although sold as new, the outside of the box showed a little wear. Products inside were unaffected. The mask is very small, but still captures the essence of the film .
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I was doing amazing at this game and it was really fun until I got that update and then I lost all of my data. So if you get this app&hellip;whatever you do&hellip;Don't Get the Update!!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|So far I'm rather entertained by this game. Good way to kill time. Ummm, only been playing for an hour all together but its fun.
B004YEJGEO|5.0|This is a fun puzzle game in which you use mirrors and prisms to align and change colors to solve the puzzles. The difficulty of the levels range from easy to pretty difficult. This game is fun and works perfect on the kindle fire. Great value at .99 cents.
B0015AARJI|5.0|We purchased an extra controller for our grandsons' Christmas gift - knowing that they were receiving a PS3.  The boys, ages 10 & 12, were ecstatic when they opened their gifts.  Both were able to play right from the start.  While we had considered other brands of controllers, it made most sense to have two identical controllers for a consistent tactile feel.  We (and the boys) could not have been more pleased with the Sony products.
B006C1DH92|5.0|This game is great. I got this as the free app of the day a few weeks ago. Runs perfect on the kindle fire, graphics are awesome. I think this version is better than the original fruit ninja. I would definitely recommend this game.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This is a very addictive game.  I'm always playing it trying to figure out the perfect move.  You wont be disappointed!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|This game is okay. If the games were cooler it would be so fun. I do like that there is an extra 16 games.
B000Q9ISSQ|5.0|I recently read this book on my Kindle after actually having both the hardcover and paperback versions sit on my bookcase for quite some time.  (I got about three copies as presents at different times. Probably should have taken a hint and read it earlier.)<br /><br />I really enjoyed the book. Bill Bryson does a good job of describing the people, places, and things of Australia.  While reading this book I found myself many times reminded of my experiences during my two trips there.  He really does a good job of capturing the hospitality of it's citizens and the beauty of the county.<br /><br />I would recommend anyone to read this book.  If you're planning a trip there it starts you in the right direction or even if you've already been it will definitely take you back.
1908538708|1.0|I have published and will continue to publish this review under any pirated murphy edition I can find.<br /><br />This edition is a fake. It is not the Official Nazi version but it is clear the publisher is trying to make it sound like it by putting \\"OFFICIAL\\" in the title. It is not from any Official Third Reich sources either. That is blatantly false. This is a copy that was downloaded from the internet where it is widely available for free (dont bother downloading, read the rest of my review to find out why it is not worth downloading for free) and then published as a pirate copy.  Some random character sticking his own introduction does not make it right and does not make it worth reading. This is a British translation by James Murphy.<br /><br />The name Murphy attached to it is the first indication to avoid this book. Don't waste your time. This edition is abridged by 20% which means it is 20% shorter than the original German because so much was edited out by Murphy. The Murphy translation is also full of errors. I will not relist those errors here but you can find them in the book Mein Kampf A Translation Controversy which compares various translations.<br /><br />I think it is terrible that people download this poor quality public domain version(which is available for free from gutenberg australia) and sell it here. My advice is do not buy any Mein Kampf that is a Murphy Translation or any that does not list who the translator is(which will be Murphy but the seller does not want to admit it). The Manheim translation is no better.<br /><br />I ticks me off to see these people selling a public domain version of Murphy's version so I felt the need to vent here.
B002KQ6BT6|3.0|Having been a fan of both The Da Vinci Code and Angels and Demons, I went into reading this book expecting a lot.  I think that's why I wasn't completely satisfied with this book.  It was a good read and while reading it I could picture exactly what Langdon was writing.  I found myself not wanting to put it down at times because of the excitement he was building in the story.  There were even some great surprises.  My disappointment came with the ending.  I don't want to give away anything for those that may not have read it but I thought Langdon did not do a good job in wrapping up the story.  There seemed to be a few too many loose ends.<br /><br />Overall, I would recommend reading The Lost Symbol but personally I would not go into it expecting another Da Vinci Code.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|could be a little bit more attractive looking but its good for the most part. great for the kindle . have fun
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Great game starts off easy then gets really hard. Real easy to play and alot of fun. Great way to kill time
B004XQO90O|5.0|When I saw the trailer for this movie I thought it looked interesting. When I saw it in theaters I turned out to be even better then I expected. This is a great action movie.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|A lot of time we don't know where to started reading the Bible.  But with the lesson. plans it helps a lot.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Found a nice variety of games with many levels of challenge.  would recommend this multiple game in one. Great for most all ages.
B004XJHBCE|5.0|and it is better than ever now.. it keeps getting better! keep up the good work dev!  I am currently using this on the Kindle Fire running Go Launcher... its perfect.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|The product was shipped and received quickly and in the condition as it was described. Would definitely purchase from again.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Great app easy to use. thank you for making so easy to check the weather at night.  I feel safer.
B004I8WD6E|4.0|I received mine today. I ordered the case based on the reviews and the pictures posted. It's a very nice clear case. All the opening holes fits perfectly to my new AT&T iPhone 4S. The back designed is nice but it kinda locks in the moisture a little bit. Not sure if it's because of the ZAGG Invisible Shield. And yes, I didn't use the screen protector. For now, I'll use the case but I'll eventually change it as soon as I get tired of it. I think this case will look more cooler for white iPhone.
B0055SWM08|4.0|The soft colors and gentle music encourage relaxation, giving you room to clear your mind to enjoy the experience of Quell. I hope that Fallen Tree creates more games like this.
B000X107GI|5.0|Works perfectly well. Did not find any issues. Got in Amazon at $ 2.05 for a pack of 5 vs the local store where it was $ 3.75 for just one battery. I am happy
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this app. it has lots of great games with out having to download a bunch of different games.
B006RUJST6|5.0|I originally bought this to help a new author (I work with her sister) and know nothing about slam poetry. I couldn't put this book down! When it was availavable for the free download I told all my friends about it and many of them downloaded it and loved it! Now that it's available in hardcover, more people can read it and enjoy it as much as I do! I enjoyed this story so much...like others who have commented, I wasn't sure if this was going to be another teenage story but was very happy with the many twists and turns and ups and downs...not to mention the laughter and tears...believe me, you will need tissues! I can't wait for the sequel...There will be a sequel, right?!!?!!
B005XQLBU4|5.0|good ol missle defence! simple yet fun gameplay, with upgrades for your defences and a well paced difficulty curve increase.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|This movie just doesn't make that men think about what they need to do to be better fathers, it also makes us mothers think about being better mothers to our faith, family, and most of all following God.  They did a great job again and can not wait for the next one. Thank you so much for doing this movie.
0312370849|4.0|I got this book for a friend, but she isn't a big fan of novels.  So I took the book over and have been narrating the story to her while we drive to and from work.  I am sure she will read it once she's done with whatever she is reading now.  The story is sad, compelling, and moving.  One drawback is that there are too many characters coming and going, and references to them are hard to follow.  All the same, this book is one of the better works of modern fiction I have come across in the last few years.
B005ELZNH0|3.0|This is a great package if you believe that the only good music by Miles is on Columbia and recorded in the studio. The 4 great Prestige albums (Cooking, Relaxing, Working, and Steaming) are only topped by Kind of Blue and Milestones. Birth of the Cool may be just as important as any Miles record. In addition, some of the greatest Miles efforts are on Prestige albums that were released before the 1st Quintet records. You also need to own Something Else by Cannonball Adderley, which shares much of the personnel with KoB and is from the same period. This package contains too much post 2nd Quintet material and excludes the wonderful live material from the early to mid 1960's. Most of the music is fine, but the title is just a lie.
B0068RHGJM|4.0|It's Nightwish, so you know it's going to be good.  This is their second album with the new singer, and a concept album.  It's an excellent album, but something about it just doesn't grab me like the last one.  Maybe it's just where it's not quite as good for the sing along in the car (heavy choral bits a duets make that tricky).  Still good, still worth listening to, and still worth having.
1451648537|5.0|I completed this book today.  When I picked it up it was out of curiosity.  I've been in the technology industry ( computers and networking) for 27 years as an engineer, marketer and executive.  I grew up not liking Steve as a business leader based on the stories I had heard from friends and colleagues.  I was prejudiced by the knowledge that his prickly side could be very hurtful to the people whom he held accountable for different successes.  And I have always subscribed to the thought that the ends (great products and customer experiences) don't justify the means (berating your workforce publicly in order to drive perfection).  After reading Isaacson's diligently researched and written exposé, I changed my mind about Steve.  The author exposes the good the bad and the ugly, not at all one-sided as one single star reviewer puts it, but in a way that the complex dimensions of his personality and decision process unfolds over time so that you can better understand Steve and what made him \\"tick\\" in his youth and in his later years.  I have a new found respect not just for Apple and Pixar, but for this man and his drive for integrated marriage of art and technology.  This book does uncover fundamental flaws in certain personality traits, but also illustrates a good man--a good human being--who's passion for his genius ideas shows us who he really was.  On a final note, when I read the one and two star reviews, i wondered if some of these folks actually finished the book  If you only read halfway through you'll have a very different perspective of this man than if you read the entire book cover to cover.  In my opinion, it's written very well with a balanced and unbiased perspective.  It isn't until the very end that Isaacson actually  opens up with some personal opinion.  This is the way it should be written--leaving the reader to make up his/her own mind.
0955153077|5.0|I finally received my book today and I flipped through it and it's simply amazing the depth of detail that is covered in this little book. I would highly recommend this for beginners. I do hope that 3D Total will publish more volumes !
1451627289|5.0|Spoiler alert.  Just add Biff Tannen, Doc, and Marty McFly and you'd have \\"Back to the Future Part IV\\". Our main character travels back to the 1950's, taking with him information on the outcome of sporting events so he can fund his time travels. Gee, that sounds familiar.  If Jake's primary goal is to stop Oswald, why not just track him down in 1958, shoot him and come back to 2011 and see the outcome? Why invest five years of his life? If it didn't work, he could try again and again. (He didn't know about the strings in the beginning of the story.)  With his knowledge of winners of sporting events, why not move to Las Vegas, where gambling is legal, and place a lot of small bets on long shots and bank the money?  None of those choices would make as interesting a story as the one in this book, and this is a well told story. I didn't want it to end, but it has a very sweet ending.  Stephen King's literary tool of making \\"the past\\" a machine that fights change, makes all of the, what would otherwise be implausible, obstacles make sense. The more obstacles the characters encounter, the more they fit the story.  This book creates great mind pictures. It gets a bit bogged down in the middle, with the dancing, school plays, and romance, but comes through with a lot of good suspense and great story treats in the end.  Yes, it's not likely that the FBI would hand this guy $1,000 and a bus ticket and tell him to get lost, after being questionably involved in an attempt on the life of the President of the United States. Also, it's not likely that a near miss on the President's life would have had as much news impact as Stephen King thinks it would have. It would have been big news for a week or two then gotten lost in the new news.  An hour and a half movie could not do justice to all of the details in this story. It would be better as an HBO series.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like the games they are fun.. I thought they were going to be lame but me my husband and my 4yr old love playing...
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I was not to excited to get it but it turned out to be awesome. it is probably one of the best games you will ever play get it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! if you do you will like it probably. if you don't like it well that is your own problem.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Good to pass the time by. Great for these little 5 to 10 mind of waiting on some thing. I would recommend.
B00656C6KK|5.0|It's a pleasure to hear some \\"new\\" recordings by the always superb Doris Day. I've enjoyed listening to this disk, both the songs recorded in the 80s (really good arrangements and back-ups), as well as a few of DD's older recordings. They're all gems. Glad to see that this disk has been such a big seller in both the U.S. and Britain (and elsewhere as well, I understand). No one sings a pop song better than Doris Day.
B0015DROBO|4.0|I like the story. There is a lot of detail about nothing important. It is pure fantasy and the characters are not beleivable and hard to keep track of sometimes. There were parts of the book that I had to skim through because it either lost me or was too much detail about nothing I wanted to read about. However the main story line reads like a mistery and it is captivating. It is a thriller and at that it is successful. It was good enough that I read the \\"Girl Who kicked the Hornets Nest\\". No I did not read them in order but two books was enough for me.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I drive all over the country. This app is great for tracking weather warnings. I've avoided some hazardous conditions this winter.
B006HTUZ1C|5.0|This game is enjoyable and addicting. It is wonderfully entertaining and I feel like my brain is getting a good workout at the same time! My math skills have improved, no question, since purchasing... I would recommend this as an educational game for children and adults alike.
B004ZRV3AU|5.0|This works great as long as you follow the directions. It might take a couple tries to get it right, but after that it works like a charm! I'm very happy with my purchase.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|An extremely fun game with a lot of variety to keep you entertained all day long or for those short periods of time with nothing yo do.
0307719774|5.0|This is going to sound corny but I look forward to writing in my journal every night.  The questions are good well thought out questions.  It will be cool to see what I wrote the year before and in ten years to get it out and see what I wrote in those 5-years of my life.  Negatives: The size 6x4x1, no ribbon bookmark and at certain places in the book it's hard to get it to lay flat when I'm writing so it makes my writing sloppy (and my writing is already sloppy).
B000F8O1LG|3.0|Ther is nothing wrong with the item, at all.  Only, it is not for USA viewing, but, yes, on the computer.
B0036EH3XE|1.0|This was the most improper and \\"magical\\" ending I have ever seen from a television series, that started out beautifully through scientific examinations of the plane crash, attempts at community building, and tried to give us some faith in extra-ordinary events in character's lives, and faith in the island's history.<br /><br />I did not have any problem understanding both sides - science and faith, but the ending in LOST season 6 is pathetic by any standard, since it did not explain anything through either science or faith, but pure magic, which made no sense unless there was something or someone causing the magic.<br /><br />In the end, Locke (the \\"faith\\" guy) is dead, Jack (the \\"science\\" guy) is confused and tries to kill himself, and the \\"others\\" (native inhabitants of island) had their leader (Jacob) killed and the island sinks to the bottom of the ocean. What an ending!
B004FGMDOQ|3.0|Didn't realize it was young adult when I bought it, but read on since you can't return a kindle version.  Pictures showed up great on my kindle fire.  Wished I could've zoomed in on some.  Really liked how the pictures were authentic and not made for the book.  First half was good then it got really really contrived feeling.  It was entertaining, but lacked something...might be the YA writing.
B001HN690O|5.0|Usually I assume that the sequel will not live up to the expectations set up by the first movie in the series and usually that turns out to be true, especially in animated movies. Therefore, I waited a month after I got the movie to even open it and watch it. However, this sequel is beyond awesome, as my granddaughter would say. The plot itself is wonderful, the villain is excellent, and the morality and the wisdom that underlie the plot are needed in the world of children today. I am a big fan of excellent graphics and eastern philosophy. So much rings true in this movie. You care about all of the characters, even the villain. I keep going back to watch it again, simply to be truly entertained. Definitely a keeper for my collection. There is a teaser at the end that seems to predict a third movie. I hope that whoever produced this one will be in charge of it, so that the excellence carries on.
B004RKXN44|4.0|Hi I have started to read Nalini Singh Psy-changelings series, and I like it, I enjoyed her story line it was quiet complexed and she carried the story to the end, I really am anticipating whats going to happen now, and who the author will be writing about next. I think if you like a bit of action, suspense and sexy interludes to say the least buy. You will not be disappointed and I believe that you will be please, I have enjoyed her Angel series as well so lets see what she will be writing next.
B004O3YGMC|2.0|When it connects it works pretty good. Problem is it keeps knocking my connection out on my droid Razr. It will sit and try to connect and then all of a sudden my 3g disappears. It happened repeatedly and even after rebooting the phone. For some reason it just knocks the phones 3g offline.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I have both the ipod version and the andriod on my kindle.  My daughter recommended as my \\" first app\\".  I find it easy to use and so portable.  I like reading in different translations,and having them at my fingertips. Thank for all it has taken to get the Bible into so many hands!!!!
B005HS00NW|5.0|Really grows on you.  Got hooked on Midnight City, but after a few listens I find myself wanting to listen to different songs over and over.  Sign of a great album.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game has a lot of different games and fun to play. some thing for all ages. the darts is my favorite.
B003521R6G|2.0|I am glad that I finally saw Kevin Bacon's performance in this, but the film was a big disappointment.  There were some good moments, however I found most of the film b-o-r-i-n-g.  Try Dirty Dancing instead.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I love this game its fun and works great for kindle fire plus the game is a really good price for how much palying time you get
0064410935|4.0|The book arrived in exellent condition; my only disappointment is that it took longer than usual to arrive - about 3 weeks, I think. Otherwise, no problems.
098478280X|5.0|This is one of the few books which I can claim to have an extremely high ROI, especially for software developers. Whether looking for tech jobs or not, the book does much more than just giving you a good list of programming exercises. It fosters problem-solving ability and logical thinking one step at a time. Thumbs up and keep up the good work!!
B00021R7CG|4.0|This movie is an excellent Soviet-USA conflict thriller!  It shows how the conflict was rooted deep in America and within the military personnel themselves. It is not always as simple as right vs wrong.
B0043EV774|4.0|Very pleased on the price I got for this 4 Disc combo. Enjoyed watching it in 3D also. Grandchildren love it too.
B00009TB5G|5.0|My husband just loves, loves, loves this movie.  So glad I was able to find all three extended editions for him for Christmas. I'll be shopping here more often!
B004LWZW7E|4.0|This movie stood out to me sure it wasn't perfect but it was well done and at least the idea was fresh. Lets be honest in a economic downturn hollywood is afraid to take a risk and make something new or go out on a limb with a fresh idea. Its all prequels sequels and spin offs flooding the theaters at the moment and this movie broke away from that trend and kept me entertained wondering what would happen next. I was surpised I didnt pay attention to the actors when I went in, I hate Amanda Seyfried, shes horrible in every movie I've seen of her except Mean girls because the part of a dumb blonde teenager fits her. Her acting in serious rolls never seems to fit. But she pulled it off with this title. I didn't even recognize her big bug eyes and horrible acting, maybe all hope for her acting career isn't lost. Now Justin on the other hand played decent as well, not perfect but decent and that was enough for me. Im glad the director had the courage to bring us something new and could pull it off. I don't know why so many people hate it.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|This is the ultimate youtube app that lets you download and watch youtube videos. It's the only youtube app you will need for the kindle fire. It lets you search for all you tube videos and there are tons of other features. definately get this for your kindle fire since there isn't an official youtube app for the fire.
B0009WFELY|5.0|This is easily one of the best records I have ever had the pleasure of listening to, and having it on vinyl enhances everything! Best $20 I've spent in a while
0345529057|5.0|The books G.R.R.Martin's saga is possibly the best fantasy fiction I've read since J.R.R.Tolkien's Lord of the Rings. The words just flow off the pages, like reading a song.
B004SBB0LU|5.0|I was very happy when I received the box set of the first albums. I was a little leery about buying a remastered set after hearing about the \\"sound wars\\" and how bad remastering really meant they just increased the volume. This wasn't true for these CDs. Audio was crisp, clear, and great sounding with no excessive increase in volume from earlier recordings. I am truly glad I bought this, and I would recommend it for anyone else. All I can really say in the end: Queen rocks, and this was a great buy. Well worth your money.  P.S. the sleeves for the CDs are very cool!
B005XQLBU4|5.0|This game starts off easy and gradually speeds up and becomes more difficult. In the early levels, the player is allowed to become comfortable with the dynamics of the game, as well as upgrade their missiles. Once the player reaches the higher levels (nights), the game becomes more strategic and requires more concentration.  Overall, the game is very fun, but can become a bit repetitive.
B005WFWVL4|2.0|The movie was great - watch it, I swear you'll start washing your hands a lot more :)  UltraViolet Digital Copy is now partnered with Flixster.  The partnership means that you have to use the Flixster Client application to download and view the UltraViolet Digital Copy.  For those of you who, like me, are used to downloading the UltraViolet Digital Copy through iTunes those days are over.  I always looked out for the Digital Copy logo because it meant I could watch the movies using my Apple TV when I didn't want to take advantage of the Blu Ray format.  The Flixster Client will let you copy the content to an iPod Touch, iPad or iPhone but it is done through the client app not through iTunes which means the content is not available on your Apple TV.  The Flixster Experience isn't a good one and suffice it to say that I will now be looking out for the UltraViolet Digital Copy so that I can avoid wasting my money on it.  Enjoy the movie: think twice about UltraViolet/Flixster Digital Copy.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great, awesome, fun, hard, cool, nice, great for kids, colorful, easy, lots of funny looking games, make you came back for more
B0062NAX1U|5.0|What can I say? This was simply the best movie I have seen in a VERY long time. I am a Christian, and it is hard to find movies that have a good message, are family friendly, and entertaining. I'll be very honest - I've seen a lot of \\"Christian\\" movies. Some are really not \\"Christian\\" at all, and the ones that are, despite their good message, quite often are very slow-moving or cheesy/low-budget flicks. \\"Courageous\\" has them all beat hands down - this film has something that will touch a nerve and hit home for everyone. The acting is top notch for a Christian film, which is generally known for less-than-stellar performances, and you will alternately laugh and cry throughout the whole film. Although aimed toward men, the powerful message is universal. I am a woman, but after the movie was over, I realized that all of us, men and women, need to step up and have the courage to give the best that we can to our families, regardless of what kind of family we have... My boyfriend is not a Christian, but when this movie was over, he looked at me and before I could even ask him what he thought, said, \\"That was a good movie.\\" Quite a high compliment from him, actually!<br />I cannot recommend this film enough!!!
B0058VW36U|5.0|this is an awesome game it really hooks u into the game the levels are really good and i would love to see what other levels they come up with next
B006WQLH7G|1.0|went through the long installation procedure and agreed to a lot of permissions (it's a security app, so that's fine) but then it says that the different programs of the Avast suite don't have the same digital signature and the app shuts off.<br /><br />This one's not fully cooked yet. I'd wait a while before trying it, on the Kindle Fire for sure.
B005OK721G|4.0|I love movies like this. If you enjoy the typical Angelina Jolie type of movie especially SALT you should enjoy this one too. While watching it I kept thinking of what a great video game it would be as well. In the vain of Tomb Raider. It's fast paced, it looks good and it's just edgy enough to keep you watching. It's not a mind blowing story but it's sure worth the time and a box of popcorn.
B000P0J09W|5.0|I purchased the CD for my grandsons who absolutely loved it. It was a classic of my children and now the grandchildren are falling in love with it.

0525478817|5.0|I love all of John Green's work and truly admire him as a person. But I was still surprised by how hard this book hit me.  The Fault in Our Stars is not a happy book. It has happy moments, but there is this sense of tragedy that you just can't seem to shake. John Green's words pick you up and pull you in, past the intelligent dialogue and witticisms, to show you just how it feels to be dying and trying to live despite it.  I cried continuously from page 99 onwards. I started reading the second I unboxed the book, and put it down only once, when I realised that I wasn't going to stop crying and should probably fetch my jumbo box of tissues.  The sadness is unavoidable, but the story is so worth the tears. It is hauntingly real and beautifully insightful. This book will stay with you forever.
B004I1AGTC|5.0|Excellent acting, scenery, everything. A must see for any martial artist, especially if they're interested in martial history. If you liked the 1st IP Man, you'll LOVE what comes next!

B002MQYOFW|3.0|[[ASIN:0439023521 The Hunger Games]]  I just finished this book. The other reviews are correct. The author has you from the first page and you just can't quit reading. But, I will not buy the other books in the trilogy. Even though I am sixty years old, I found the premise of this book terribly disturbing. A post American world that lives in districts with a dictatorship is frightening enough. But a return to the times of the gladiators shows our culture in a decline I don't even want to think about. While the book was well written and certainly captivating, I will not be reading the sequels.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|for all of those with kindle fire you people didn't do it right. I have a kindle fire and NO BUGS AT ALL, if there is one when you go on and click on a bird and zoom out just get out and get on it again, or you just swich the level. plus the game has the same thing as the paid version, it just has adds.Its also really,really fun.
B005BW15XS|4.0|This one was the album I couldn't wait to get my hands on when I first heard Commander and than Rose Colored Glasses. But I was highly disappointed when that out of the first three singles released to promote this project that neither Rose Colored Glasses nor Grown Woman which I find to be highly superior to Commander wasn't even on the album. The album turned away from a pop album back to her traditional R&B roots. I was pleased with the tracks that where included on it. My favorites are I'm Dat Chick, Lay It on Me, and the remix of Commander featuring Nelly.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|hi I'm 11 and I love all of these games when I ride the bus it is so awesome fuzz it takes the time away and it seems like a short time on the bus :).

B0034G4P7Q|4.0|This latest David Fincher movie is all it's cracked up to be.  What is seemingly a pretty boring premise (geeks and the internet) turns out to be an interesting character study and even presents a more modern day equivalent of Wall Street than \\"Money Never Sleeps\\".  We see how ideas are corralled and fortunes are made.  Well we don't actually see how the fortunes are made.  Advertising and sales are seemingly not important.  Money is to be made when ideas are packaged and sold to others who think they can figure a way to be profitable.  If we are to believe this quasi-biography we see that Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg is a real ass-hole.  A great performance by primo geek Jesse Eisenberg is spot on.  We also get a nice performance by Justin Timberlake as Napster founder Sean Parker, another real ass-hole.  There is another brief but important peek at Rooney Mara as Zuckerberg's erstwhile girlfriend.  We can see how Fincher is smitten with her.  Me too.
0061733199|5.0|Great book to give your kids and grandkids.Also a  good coffee table book. I am always checking on the animal  tracks page and the plant pages. The pictures are most helpful.
B005SFS4ZU|5.0|If you attend movie theaters with any regularity you've probably seen a trailer for a variety of \\"special\\" showings of productions not typical for the venue.  These are usually operas, symphonic orchestras, ballets and other more traditional art forms.  I actually checked these out a couple times but the high ticket cost has kept me away.  I stumbled upon this Blu ray version of a live production in London of Andrew Lloyd Webber's \\"Phantom.\\"  This was in fact, the 25th anniversary production staged by Cameron Mackintosh.<br /><br />This is a fairly significant departure from the 2004 film version in terms of staging.  While some will quibble with some of the singing in the movie, there should be no issues with this fine stage production.  And a stage production is what this is.  At the same time you will get the sense of a film as cameras are everywhere and the editing is extremely good.  With this superb Blu ray transfer you may even be taken aback with some of the close-ups which show wig lines, make-up and mics.  I found it interesting and never an issue.  Speaking of the disc itself again.  The DTS-Master Audio sound is spectacular.  The surrounds are active throughout, not only with the music but with whispers, sound effects and individual instruments.<br /><br />While all of the singing is top notch, kudos to Wendy Ferguson as the plump Carlotta.  She does a lot with a small role.  And Sierra Boggess is amazing as Christine.  Her voice is spectacular to the point of bringing tears and her acting is perfect.  Ramin Karimloo as the Phantom and Hadley Fraser as Raoul are solid throughout.  The costumes, projection designs, choreography and set designs far exceed any of the many versions of the \\"Phantom\\" that I've seen.  If that isn't enough, after the production concludes, Andrew Lloyd Webber introduces former cast members from the first company and several \\"Phantoms\\" that followed throughout the years.  Yes, Michael Crawford is there, but doesn't sing.  We also get to see and hear the former Mrs. Webber, Sarah Brightman, sing along with 4 of the former and current \\"Phantoms.\\" This package is short on extras but does include a DVD version along with the Blu ray.  If you can't make it to the theater in person, this is about as good as it gets.the former Mrs. Webber, Sarah Brightman, sing along with 4 of the former and current \\"Phantoms.\\" This package is short on extras but does include a DVD version along with the Blu ray.

0060751967|3.0|HOW TO MARRY A MILLIONAIRE VAMPIRE. It was the title that made me want to read this book. I had hoped it would be different than what it was, and therefore my rating might be lower than I would have originally given. When you go into a book with expectations--expectations, I might add, that were given to me by the title alone--and you finish the book wondering why the hell things were totally different in the novel . . . well, you end up being disappointed. As I am.<br /><br />I thought this would be more of a comedy and less of a harlequin romance. Don't get me wrong, this book had it's moments where I was laughing out loud (especially a scene where the MC, Shanna, thought that Roman, the love interest and vampire, was dead instead of sleeping), but overall I found myself wanting to gag at the way Roman was acting. There was no spark between these characters for me. Though Shanna wasn't a hateable MC, she didn't exactly have qualities that explained why Roman would fall for her and vice versa. I actually thought there was more spark between Shanna and the Highlanders, who I very much enjoyed. They were my favorite characters in the whole book, and their humor was a relief in the otherwise dull romance between the two MCs.<br /><br />On another note, some of the lines were almost identical to ones I read in TWILIGHT. While I don't like to compare one novel to another, it really bothered me. The thing is, this book actually came out a few months before TWILIGHT did. I'm sure it's all a coincidence, but it still bugged the hell out of me. And it's not really relevant to my review, but I am curious to know if anyone else noticed this. (Side note: I enjoyed the lines in TWILIGHT better, where they didn't seem so cheesy for some reason.)<br /><br />Also, the conflict in this novel was different than others I have read in this genre. However, the resolution at the end of the book was abrupt and not very fulfilling. And, to be honest, it seemed a little OOC for the villain to just accept his fate and the terms negotiated between him and Roman. Though how the villain died was satisfactory considering what an ass he was.<br /><br />And lastly, no one got married in this book. It's talked about, but there is no marriage. There really isn't a proposal. Oh, and if I have to read Roman calling Shanna \\"sweetness\\" one more time, I'm going to gouge my eyes out with a fork. Just sayin'. If you are one for cheesy romances, this is the book for you.he terms negotiated between him and Roman. Though how the villain died was satisfactory considering what an ass he was.

B004XQO90E|5.0|I think a viewer needs to be a certain type.  Source code is a science fiction story.  The viewer needs to be able to suspend what they know and allow themselves to go along for the ride.  One thing about the story that I kept thinking was how I would do this differently, but then I realized that the character had emotional issues of his own to deal with.  The progression of events demonstrates a rather typical bias against the military and the belief that they will always consider things in terms of \\"acceptable losses.\\"  Still, in this movie the big, bad military supervisors are dealt with rather elegantly by an underling that won't follow orders.  The result is somewhat shocking on the one hand, and somewhat predictable on the other.  Overall I enjoyed the story, even with the bias, the predictable issues all the way through, and the questionable science.  This is science fiction - all of these things.  You accept it for what it is or you don't.

B00009NQQO|5.0|We got this for our 11 month old for Christmas. He loves it! It sticks to the tub very well, he even uses it to pull himself to a standing position and it holds his weight without popping off. He loves to take out the balls and put them back in, so for us we like that the hoop is not open at the bottom. Our son has more fun with it this way, and it has an added purpose of storing the balls (and a few other small tub toys as well!) We are very satisfied with this purchase!

0380789019|3.0|I like character driven stories. This book is not character driven. If it wasn't for the fun, novel plot this book would've been a bust.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I love this game its helps me just relax after a long day of stressing my brain . I play it evening and on my lunch break to just unwind
0060558121|4.0|Tropes:<br /><br />Hero Cycle, Lone Wolf, World Religion, Unexpected Twist, Origin Story<br /><br />I like that this books rewards readers who have an understanding of world religions and mythology. I loved that the author deliberately deceived me.  The prose wasn't extraordinary, it was solidly good.
B005K17RU0|4.0|I like having the temp in the corner of my kindle. It's easy to see rather than having to search. Good info when app is opened too..

B0054JZC6E|3.0|easy bunch of games. half the interest is fighting out how to play the games. no directions. but fun to play
B005HSG3VK|5.0|~~~EDIT: May 23, 2016~~~<br /><br />Over four years since my original purchase date, and this thing is still solid. The strap is a tad stretched and pilly. But everything else about this bad boy is rock solid. I knew I would love it for life from the start. PLEASE MAKE THIS FOR THE NEXT VERSIONS OF KINDLEEEEE. Then I my life will be complete TT_____TT<br /><br />~~~END EDIT: May 23, 2016~~~<br /><br />~~~EDIT: April 29, 2014~~~<br /><br />Two years later, I'm still in love with this case! I was so sad to see they haven't made a comparable one for the newer kindle hdx. I planned on getting my sister one. Now I'm sad. :(<br /><br />~~~END EDIT: April 29, 2014~~~<br /><br />[Original comment: January 17, 2012]<br /><br />When I set out looking for a case for my new kindle fire, my prerequisites were for a thin case that could fit easily into my purse without adding bulk, yet have enough substance to protect against being knocked, and hopefully something pretty. With this case, I was satisfied in all three areas, and with the added bonus of having a built in stand. The strap is equally appreciated.<br /><br />What would have been nice was if it had more than one level of slanting, namely adding more divots in the back for different viewing angles. It would be hugely helpful as I find that sometimes the provided viewing angle is not very convenient. However, that is only a slight annoyance, as the screen quality on the kindle does not change drastically as you move from center view.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this case to anyone looking for a streamlined, protective, and stylish case for their kindle fire!
B005XQLBU4|5.0|better than the original. easy to play. fast fingers needed. great time waster. vote obama. keep America free and unpaid for
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Great  substitute for missle command, crashed on me once during game play though but it was in the first level so it didn't much
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Eliminates any excuse for not reading and studying the Holy Word! Couldn't get any easier or any better than being able to pinpoint a scripture or get quick advice anytime of the day, any place.

B0052U59F4|3.0|I love the story but there are so many spelling, grammar, punctuation issues it's hard to overlook.  These were all issues in both the stories I've read.  Example- one character goes from being Rose to Ros and I'm not sure who she is really supposed to be.  Example- Ana receives a note but the note itself is shown several pages before the part where it says she got a note.  Example- paragraphs of dialogue run together making it hard to know who is speaking.
B002SSUQFG|5.0|many have reviewed this very watch and its awesome, for the price and what you get is simply unbeatable. this watch is perfect for anyone with a small wrist as the watch dial does not crowd your arm, and its accurate enough for daily use where unless the average user decides to sit next to a credible time source for comparison, likely will never notice is the watch slips at all.    eventually you may start searching what this watch is all about and come across many posts in various watch forums, well, when it comes down to the cost of a watch, its the quality of the mechanical movement, and that also contributes to the accuracy of the watch. for what you spend on this watch, the accuracy is great, and if you want better, start looking at $500+ watches. if you instead want a daily watch you can wear without worry, this watch is for you.    here is an article i came across and the site reviews a bunch of watches and the only way it gets better than one SNK809 is maybe another SNK series watch, just to have a variety of dial colors. [...]/    another thing you will likely want to do when you get it is to change the watch strap as it is crap (well, at least i don't like it). in case you have to search for the lug width of the SNK809, let me save you some time, it is 18mm. there are various sources for cheap straps on ebay as well as amazon, or a trip to the mall and to a watch kiosk yielded me a $10 leather strap which instantly improved the watch appearance as well as comfort (as i said earlier, can't stand the stock strap).    since some has asked me this question, for those of you who are shooting sports enthusiasts, the recoil will not have any adverse effect on the watch, in fact; the recoil will wind the automatic movement.    additional things not mentioned or shown in the description is that the day of the week is bilingual and the rear bezel (read: back of he watch) is clear and can see the movements, which is a neat feature in it's self.
B0067QPVD2|4.0|I thought that was one of the coolest factors of this movie!!!  I will be owning it as I own the Kurt Russel version!!  CG was a little fake.. I so miss the good ol days when they used puppets and make-up.. Other people have already told you the basis of the movie so I dont' need to rehash it..<br /><br />I liked it and will be owning it!!
B005PK1G76|5.0|This is a great organizer for stroller. I have a Baby Jogger City Mini and it fit perfectly. I turned mine so the Diono words are facing the stroller.  It is a very roomy organizer and can hold a lot. I looked at other stroller organizers but chose this one based on the reviews and the great price. It also has a zippered pocket inside for ID and money
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|I had this on my nook color, and when I bought a Xoom, in had to get this for it.  It is the best drawing app for my kids, and I even enjoy it.  Definitely worth the price compared to the free stuff out there.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Awesome game lots of fun and easy to play.  Just hard enought to keep playing.  My kids love it too
B006YC74E8|5.0|I was weary at first with no reviews but the screen shots sold me. I've only done one photo but I love it so far! I highly recommend it!
B005ARYEY6|5.0|Any music by Miles Davis you just can't go wrong. These live recordings are fantastic . It is nice to listen to the recordings to remind you why he was so great. The sound quality was great considering it was recorded in 1967. I highly recommend this cd especially for those who have not really listened to him.I beleive it will  be an eye opener.
B00005OCMR|5.0|Everytime I buy a used DVD or CD, it usually has scratches on it, even if they're just minimal. This double DVD had zero scratches and kept in AWESOME condition. I just want to point that out because this person could have charged more money for this movie but chose not to up the cost. I was able to watch this movie with my 8 year old son on Christmas night (the same night he got it). We had a blast watching Jeff Bridges in the original version and seeing all the light cycles and light suits in comparison with the new movie, Tron Legacy. Definintely different and always fun to see how they did special effects in the 80's compared to today!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|my kids love these games. They seem to be very entertained by all of them. Some of them are a little to easy though.
0441018866|5.0|I just found my new favorite sci-fi author!  This was an absolutely wonderful book, in fact I have no doubt I'll be reading it again in the future.  What a ride!  Although during the first few pages I had my doubts, since it took me some time to get into the groove of a British writer with all the slight language variances and unfamiliar units of measurement that entails, it wasn't long at all before I was completely hooked. A wonderful story, very well thought out (the author is, after all, an astrophysicist)and well written.  Even the most out-there scenarios were described in such a way that they made perfect sense. And there was a little bit of every thing - space travel, advanced civilizations & technologies, political intrigue, conflict, mystery, nail-biting suspense, and the most achingly beautiful romance, which I was so pleasantly surprised to find in a science fiction novel!  The characters are wonderful, especially the two through whose eyes the story is told. I LOVED this book! I've ordered three more of Mr. Reynold's books, and I hope they measure up.
B005DKLPF6|4.0|Rare case of coming up with this right after CtS... It is Mastodon, it's all in here, but somehow compressed. Cool songs? It doesn't sound rushed, and it is definitely better than most of what's currently out there... Some songs do work, others just sound like those that do really work. Aside from the first two (singles, just in case...), \\"All the heavy lifting\\" and \\"Dry bone valley\\" are stand out songs... songs that compromise the listener and its comfort zone. Great songs. but one has to wonder if this is any valid indication of the future, like an open window to look into one of the many portraits Mastodon are capable to paint. Amazing songs. Not all of them. Most of them. More than half of them. But then again that's what they are... Songs. No Merrick. No Whale. No Forest. Definitely no Czar. Just songs. Life grows out of Mastodon in a confusing, but beautiful way. Real songs.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|my two oldest (6 and 5) love the assortment of games. something here for all ages. not too challenging for adults, though.
B005LFQRTC|4.0|I always thought The Six Million Dollar Man was a great series. It started with the pilot story of how he became the first bionic man (although he didn't appreciate their help, at first, and other people thought he was freaky--a robotic Frankenstein's creation of sorts!).  For those fans of the series, this is a must see!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is, by far, the best Bible application out there, and I'm so thankful it's been made available for Kindle as well. The ability to begin and continue both biblical and devotional reading plans, as well as the availability to download versions for offline use, is a great blessing indeed. Thanks, YouVersion!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Makes reading the Bible so convenient. I love having so many different versions to choose from and all the tools to make finding verses and holding my place really easy.

0143039431|5.0|I think if there was ever a time to read Grapes of Wrath, it's now.  There are many parallels in the novel's plot to what is occurring in our economy today.  There are differences, too, and they are poignant:  the strong family bond, the lack of governmental aid to the poor, and how they lived, from their cars to their houses both simplifies and complicates the Joad's journey to California and they hope, stability for their family.  Anyone who has driven along Route 66 or the Texas panhandle, for instance, can really appreciate Steinback's intense description of the Joad's journey to California and just how nerve-wracking it must have been without the benefit of a good car, motels, bottled water, and credit cards.<br /><br />For those who might complain that the narrative intermingled with the Joad's story is too lefty or smacks of propaganda, I think it adds a good balance to the story.  It gives you a sense of the anger and sadness building among nameless people as their lives fall apart, while the Joads give a name and a face to the suffering.  And again, I think it is pretty on par with what is going on today:  a universal feeling of helpfulness that really hasn't found a purpose, plan, or footing among private struggles of individuals.<br /><br />Long story short:  Grapes of Wrath is a really good novel.  And anytime I read a book where there is a moment when I actually have to put the book down because it is too painful to go on, I can't help but love the book.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|The majority of the cases in the store are always limited in supply and priced much higher.  My Fire snapped into this case without any issues and it protected.  The case allows access to the port at the bottom, power button and leaves room at the top for the speakers.  I bought this case in the Graphite and it does show smudges from my hands. I have used the folding lid to stand it up to watch a movie in bed or at my desk.  It's a great compact/sleek case and must have for any Kindle Fire owner!

0525478817|3.0|I love John Green. I love his books and I think that they're fantastic. Except for this one.  This book is very well done in terms of the writing. It is well written, no doubt, but the story itself is lacking. While the eulogies are beautiful, they are not tear inducing because the characters themselves are not tear inducing. I am a huge book and movie crier and yet I didn't shed a single tear. What was really wrong with the characters was that it was from the point of view of a girl. John Green is not a girl. He encounters the same problem that Khaled Hosseini had in A Thousand Splendid Suns. He doesn't understand the female psyche and thus the actions and emotions of Hazel are slightly ludicrous. Ladies, if you yourself were dying, would you really say no to super hot Augustus Waters because of how his past girlfriend died? No. You wouldn't. Would you suddenly be like, \\"No, I don't actually feel any attraction to you,\\" and then suddenly go to Amsterdam and mack in various locations? No. You wouldn't. Would you feel comfortable with anyone, including an attractive guy, staring at you? No. You wouldn't.  And what bothers me most is the ending. For one, he just completely rips off himself and how he ended Looking for Alaska. Both were essays of sorts about death. That was obnoxious. For two, be honest with yourselves. Would you really be okay with your parents suddenly being blasé about your death? Yes, you would probably want them to move on. But having your parents just be enthusiastic about their lives after your death is just painful to think about. And at that, no parents would be blasé about the death of a child. If your parents would, then call the child protective services. Right now. Stop reading this and get to the phone.  If you want a book about cancer that is much more accurate a depiction of a female's emotions, read Sort of Forever by Sally Warner. It was written long before and has a few of the same themes. I highly recommend it.  And Nerdfighters,don't get huffy about the fact that I don't find this book to be a particular work of genius. Think about what I said.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|addicting and fun. I don't like the ads but understand the reasoning behind them. all in all a great free game!
B005K17RU0|5.0|I think this app is fantastically awesome.  it is always accurate,  and lets me no how to dress. I reccamend it for everyone
1594630844|5.0|When I was first introduced to \\"30 Lessons,\\" I thought: \\"Great, another uplifting self-help book filled with the same old tired platitudes.\\" Boy, was I ever wrong! This book is a rare treasure offering a wealth of hard-earned insight and wisdom on the critical, bedrock issues we all struggle with to create a life that is meaningful, loving, and, at the end, absent of regret. I simply cannot overstate it -- if you've ever wished for a clear roadmap for how to live a truly good and satisfying life, well, you've just found it.

B004XN3FHA|5.0|I'm kind of a flashlight freak and have been using Surefire lights for some time with a considerable amount of loyalty toward them.  I recently lost my E1 and thought it was time to replace it with something that would throw more light.  I was looking for the most power and something that would use AA batteries as the CR type batteries are kind of pricey and are not available just anywhere.  I considered the Coast lights but I'm not a fan of the \\"bubble\\" lens that they use to achieve their high lumen output.  I settled on the Fenix TK41 based on some consumer reviews and I have to agree, this light is amazing.  It takes a bit of practice to get used to the functions since it is a 2 button switch but nothing that some fiddling can't solve.  The size is comfortable and it's built well.  It even comes with a hard case but it's not really convenient for me to store it in it.  It may seem kind of spendy, and it is, but when you compare it to some other brands like Surefire, it's a bargain.  If you are in the market for a very impressive handheld flashlight, consider this one!  You won't be disappointed.  I seem to find myself illuminating things that don't really need it just for the WOW factor.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is fairly good, but some of the games in it are kind of boring. But you have to play them to unlock the more exciting ones.
0307592731|2.0|I was interested in reading Cheryl Strayed's yet unreleased memoir mostly because I spent most of my life along the central spine of Southern California and enjoyed numerous summers hiking and camping through much of the same area she wrote about. With a picture of a single weathered and worn-down hiking boot on the cover and a title like &#34;Wild (From Lost to Found on the Pacific Crest Trail)&#34; one would expect to be reading a book about the author's nature-based adventures in the great outdoors of our westernmost border states. And to a minor degree that is what some of this story is about. It wasn't until I read the Amazon.com promotional piece on this book that I realized the title wasn't just referring to the Pacific Crest Trail (PCT), and very possibly not at all. It could very well be the author's one-word self-portrait. According to author Cheryl Strayed, she wrote &#34;Wild&#34; relying primarily on her journal notes, which I don't recall her mentioning in the story, and her own recollections of this journey in 1995. The reader should keep in mind that this book wasn't finished until 17 years after the author completed her journey.<br /><br />Strayed's memoir pictures a passionately independent 26-year-old woman from Minnesota whose life had been so much less than what she had hoped for, some of which resulted from her less than satisfying family life as a child, but mostly from her own poor life choices. Not long after several family tragedies, including the self-inflicted demise of her marriage and alienation from her siblings, Strayed makes what can only be described as a most bizarre, and to some of her friends a potentially suicidal decision to fly to the West coast and backpack her way up at least the majority of the sometimes treacherous Pacific Crest Trail (over 1,100 miles!). Why? According to Strayed, she needed to get away to think about her life, her past tragedies and her future. For whatever reason, backpacking for hundreds of miles all alone on the PCT, with no real trail experience to speak of, and only a nominal knowledge of how to use her equipment in an over-sized pack too heavy to use safely, was evidently the first thing that occurred to her. This, in itself, gives the reader an inkling about Strayed's thought processes and disjointed sense of reality.<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT: There may be plot information beyond this point that some readers may not want to know. If so, stop now or continue reading at your own risk.<br /><br />Here is a more detailed view into Strayed's mindset and insufficient level of preparation for her PCT adventure in her own words:<br /><br />&#34;It was then that I remembered that guidebook I'd plucked from a shelf at REI [A wilderness supply store of sorts] while waiting to buy the shovel a couple of days before. The thought of the photograph of a boulder-strewn lake surrounded by rocky crags and blue sky on its cover seemed to break me open, frank as a fist to the face. I believed I'd only been killing time when I'd picked up the book while standing in line, but now it seemed like something more--a sign. Not only of what I could do, but of what I had to do. When Aimee and I reached Minneapolis, I waived her off at her exit, but didn't go to mine. Instead, I drove to REI and bought &#34;The Pacific Crest Trail, Volume 1: California&#34; and took it back to my apartment and stayed up reading it all night. I read it a dozen times over the next months. I got an abortion and learned how to make dehydrated tuna flakes and turkey jerky and took a refresher course on basic first aid and practiced using my water purifier in my kitchen sink. I knew I had to change.&#34;<br /><br />As you may see, when Strayed makes a decision it is rarely well thought through or well planned, and she rarely consults anyone else but herself. Most of her decisions are reactionary and of the knee-jerk variety. If you doubt this, just take a peek at her self-designed PCT preparation &#34;To-Do&#34; list: Let's see . . . Divorce my husband . . . Check! Pack condoms . . . Check! Shack up with some guy of questionable character, have sex, sex, sex and mix in some cocaine while I'm at it . . . Check! Have an abortion . . . Check! Blame all my failures on my family . . . Check! Learn how to prepare dehydrated food . . . Check! Pick up and move over 2,000 miles away from Minnesota to somewhere in the desert near the the boarder of California and Mexico . . . Check! Pack a huge backpack so full of stuff until it's well beyond my capability to safely carry it . . . Check! And then, when that's all done, backpack and hitchhike over 1,100 miles along the Pacific Crest Trail . . . Check! Does anyone else see a dangerously self-absorbed pattern here?<br /><br />Early on in this book Strayed's major focus is on her mother's looming death. She incessantly wrote about how great the loss of her mother would be to her life. Yet, during one visit to her mother's hospital room Strayed's attention was not on her dying mother, but was instead fixated on the &#34;bulging crotch&#34; of a male nurse, who by the way was tending to her mother's care, while Strayed was deep into her fantasy of dragging the nurse into the bathroom for &#34;Wild&#34; sex. What does that tell you about this so-called grieving daughter?<br /><br />To some small degree, Strayed does attempt to come to grips with her &#34;Wild&#34; lifestyle and bring under control her incessant habit of putting the blame on other people and other things for her problems. In her own words:<br /><br />&#34;I knew what he [Her husband, Paul] was thinking. The way he looked at me told me everything I'd refused to hear from Lisa. I was different. I wasn't there. Heroin had made me that way. And yet the idea of giving it up seemed impossible. Looking Paul squarely in the face made me realize that I couldn't think straight.&#34;<br /><br />And later in the book, she wrote:<br /><br />&#34;And what Clarke knew and Rogers knew and what thousands of people who preceded and followed them knew. It was what I knew before I even really did, before I could have known how truly hard and glorious the PCT would be, how profoundly the trail would both shatter and shelter me.&#34;<br /><br />And then again near the end:<br /><br />&#34;What if I forgave myself? I thought. What if I forgave myself even though I'd done something I shouldn't have? What if I was a liar and a cheat and there was no excuse for what I'd done other than because it was what I wanted and needed to do? What if I was sorry, but if I could go back in time I wouldn't do anything differently than I had done? What if I actually wanted to [****] every one of those men? What if heroin taught me something? What if yes was the right answer instead of no? What if what made me do all those things everyone thought I shouldn't have done was what also had got me here? What if I was never redeemed? What if I already was?&#34;<br /><br />Even with what I have already said, the reader can be assured of a few redeeming qualities in this book. Strayed is an exceptional writer and storyteller, I can't emphasize that enough. So you shouldn't have a problem zipping right through this 300+ page memoir. That is, if you can also just zip over and around the crude language, her obsession with sex, her own body and a few other less than admirable personal traits that I won't mention here. Also, be prepared for a lot of repetition in this story. Some facts that are covered in the first few chapters are brought up again and again, as if the author thinks they may have slipped the reader's attention the first, second or ever the tenth yime they were mentioned.<br /><br />Once I finished &#34;Wild,&#34; I paused to consider why Strayed had been so repetitive. One thing that struck me was regardless of her obvious need for others, she seemed to so strongly relish being alone; she mentioned this over and over while on the PCT. It was then that I realized that characteristically Strayed is an unscrupulous opportunist; so much so that it made her nonsensical choice of a solo hike up the PCT make some sense, at least in a very childishly bizarre way. It gave her the most independence and at the same time the greatest opportunity to control her relationships, as if simply hiking away from them would be considered an admirable thing to do to those who had so selflessly helped her along her hike. But that is the way Strayed is.<br /><br />I've chosen to leave out one graphically violent scene in this book, mostly because it made no sense at all and I have no idea why it was even included. And also because it has already been written about in some detail in a number of other reviews of this book.<br /><br />Considering all of the other nature-based things she had to deal with on the PCT, Strayed's endless commenting on the death of her mother wore so thin that her alleged emotional bond with her mother became less believable as I moved through the book. I'm sure most readers felt her grief and guilt, though often very gratuitous, quite early on in the story and didn't need to be reminded about it several times a chapter.<br /><br />To a great degree, this book amounts to little more than Strayed's overindulgence in her unseemly personal fantasies. In her Author's Notes at the beginning of the book, Strayed (Which by the way is her &#34;acquired&#34; name. You will have to read the book to understand that one.) indicated that some material was pulled from her own recollections and some of her characters had been modified. She also goes on to say that some of the people and events were simply omitted because she deemed them unnecessary to the veracity of the story. Well, after reading this book, it is my opinion that there are still quite a number of people, events and language that could also have been scrubbed from &#34;Wild&#34; which also would not have adversely affected the veracity of the story either; especially if Strayed is the least bit interested in reaching the broadest possible audience.id, before I could have known how truly hard and glorious the PCT would be, how profoundly the trail would both shatter and shelter me.&#34;  And then again near the end:  &#34;What if I forgave myself? I thought. What if I forgave myself even though I'd done something I shouldn't have? What if I was a liar and a cheat and there was no excuse for what I'd done other than because it was what I wanted and needed to do? What if I was sorry, but if I could go back in time I wouldn't do anything differently than I had done? What if I actually wanted to [****] every one of those men? What if heroin taught me something? What if yes was the right answer instead of no? What if what made me do all those things everyone thought I shouldn't have done was what also had got me here? What if I was never redeemed? What if I already was?&#34;  Even with what I have already said, the reader can be assured of several redeeming qualities in this book. Strayed is an exceptional writer and storyteller, I can't emphasize that enough. So you shouldn't have a problem zipping right through this 300+ page memoir. That is, if you can also just zip over and around the crude language, her obsession with sex, her own body and a few other less than admirable personal traits. Also, be prepared for a lot of repetition in this story. Some facts that are covered in the first few chapters are brought up again and again, as if the author thinks they may have slipped the reader's attention the first, second or ever the third time they were mentioned.  Once I finished &#34;Wild,&#34; I paused to consider why Strayed had been so repetitive. One thing that struck me was regardless of her obvious need for others, she seemed to so strongly relish being alone; she mentioned this over and over while on the PCT. It was then that I realized that characteristically Strayed is an opportunist; so much so that it made her nonsensical choice of a solo hike up the PCT make some sense, at least in a very bizarre way. Itgave her the most independence and at the same time the greatest opportunity to control her relationships, as if simply hiking away from them would be considered an admirable thing to do to those who had helped her along her hike.  I've chosen to leave out one graphically violent scene in this book, mostly because it made no sense at all and I have no idea why it was even included. And also because it has already been written about in some detail in a number of other reviews of this book.  Considering all of the other nature-based things she had to deal with on the PCT, Strayed's endless commenting on the death of her mother wore so thin that her alleged emotional bond with her mother became less believable as I moved through the book. I'm sure most readers felt her tremendous grief and guilt quite early on in the story and didn't need to be reminded about it several times a chapter.  To a great degree, this book amounts to little more than Strayed's overindulgence in her unseemly personal fantasies. In her Author's Notes at the beginning of the book, Strayed (Which by the way is her &#34;acquired&#34; name. You will have to read the book to understand that one.) indicated that some material was pulled from her own recollections and some of her characters had been modified.

B0054JZC6E|5.0|awesome Game keeps you busy lots of fun and a great variety of games. I would def recommend to download if you want a time filler
B001B93H0O|3.0|I have been doing this work out for about one month now and love it, but ever since I opened the dvd and put it in the player on some parts it show grey the color goes away like if it was recorded or something. I have been trying to contact the seller but I never got a response that sucks.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I am now absolutely hooked on this game. everytime you complete a level new games become available so the challenge is to keep playing a game until you win.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|Just what I was looking for.  Lightweight, perfect fit, and very thin - adds only about one sixteenth of an inch in all dimensions.  The elastic band works well - folds back when tablet is in use. Tablet snaps securely in place.  Opening is provided for headphones, micro USB port, and power button.  Excellent design.  It is so lightweight, I thought the mailing envelope was empty!
B006MGDIAA|3.0|I would recommend this book in addition to the [[ASIN:0321735625 Learning Cocos2D: A Hands-On Guide to Building iOS Games with Cocos2D, Box2D, and Chipmunk]] book. It will speedup your development process immediately by giving you very useful examples/recipes. The current kindle version I would not recommend until they have fixed the formatting of the source code (check the 'look inside' function of Amazon)
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I've been using this app for a few weeks on my Kindle Fire, and so far things are going okay. One big plus is you can choose which version of the Bible you want to read from. You can also choose from a selection of Monthly Plans to use. It's also very easy to setup and use.  I haven't explore all that it offers, but I like what I see so far. If you're looking for an easy and free Bible App, try YouVersion.
B000003TAB|3.0|Took an exceptable amount of time to reach my house, I really dont remember it was a while back but I got it. The case was broken but really didnt matter. I got what I wanted in one piece, Music.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|First and foremost I'm cheap and not ashamed to say it.  I bought this because the fan that came with my stock cooler was making an annoying whine noise so it had to go.  This cooler was pretty much bar none the best value for the money, and in quite a few tests out performed coolers double its price.  I really had no intention of over clocking my processor until I got this cooler and saw how big of a drop I had in idle temps.  If I remember right I dropped about 10c at idle and at least that much with prime95 running my 1100T at 4.0 ghz.  That right there makes it worth it to me.  I added a second 120mm fan I had just sitting around.  It doesn't match the fan that comes with the cooler at all, 1100 rpm vs the 2000rpm.  Even with the slower fan as the pull and the stronger one as a push I still saw temps drop a few degrees again.  If you don't plan on over clocking or don't live in a hot environment the one fan is all you'll ever need.  With the fan at its full 2,000 rpm it is still a heck of a lot quieter than my graphics card.  I think the fastest I saw it run without manually setting it faster was 1800ish rpm.  Most time though it was just whispering along at 1000-1200 rpm, pure awesomeness.  So for those of you who are worried about noise, don't be, my dad's case fans on high are still louder than this stock fan on high.  Install was probably the biggest headache for me.  I tend to over analyze things and try to figure everything out before hand.  Which sometimes just leads to too much thinking and though and not enough doing.  The youtube videos I found didn't really help me and the instructions were worthless.  Best advice is to glace at the instructions, watch a couple of the youtibe videos and then just do it.  It's on there now though and that's where it's going to stay, at least until I upgrade again.  I have a cooler master 932 full tower and this thing fits with inches to spare.  Don't know if it will fit yours but measure twice cut once is normally a good rule of thumb.  For all those who say that this cooler will block one of your ram slots, yeah it can especially if you have tall ram.  I have corsair's dominator ram that comes with heatsinks on the ram.  With the heatsinks on the fan wouldn't fit on the ram side.  I had 4 options:  Remove a stick, remove a heatsink from a stick, do just 1 fan pulling (which seems to be the popular answer), or do what I ended up doing just offset the fan.  Simple solution to a simple problem.  Yeah so my fan doesn't sit flush with the top of the cooler's heatsink, it comes out about 1\\" above the top of the heatsink.  With the push/pull setup I didn't notice any temp differences.  So if you want you can try that solution instead of leaving out a stick of ram.  Even with just one fan I can't really see it harming anything other than aesthetics.  Pros:  -Dropped my stock temps quite a bit and helped keep my over clocking temps well below that dreaded 70c \\"limit\\"  -Cheap  -Quiet with the fan that came with it  -Easy install of fan and second fan  -Works as advertised  -Easily customizable for any 120mm fan.  I currently have 2 120 scythe fans that my buddy gave me (2 of these spinning at their max 3k rpm can wake the dead)  Cons:  -Install can be a big PITA, varies per person but general consensus seems to learn towards PITA  -Uhhh...won't cook me bacon?  not really a con but price has gone up six bucks in the less than a month since I bought it.
B005HSL626|5.0|my God its great i have loved it sence my friend showed me it on her tablet she can use three fingers but on mine only two we have diffrent tablets but whatevas
B00335EQ0E|4.0|The DVD was still in the sealed Plastic, however the sleeve that it came in was torn and had some other minor damage to it. I was giving it as a gift so I had to take the sleeve off but it was supposed to be in new condition and I don't consider damages covers new. But other then that it was all good. 4 stars.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Running on HTC EVO 4G 2.3.3. Works perfectly. Better than Atari's recreation. Fun, entertaining, and challenging. I got as FAOTD, don't know what they're asking for it, but if it's $. 99 it's worth it.
014241543X|4.0|This kept you on the edge of your seat waiting to find out what happens. You get in depth with the characters- wish the was more to end ending!--- Hence with there's a sequel! Thank you for the fantastic read a flew through it and made me laugh and cry.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I enjoy some of these games. my son enjoys others. some are easy enough for my four year old. I enjoy unlocking the games and beating my personal best scores.
B0063GORYU|4.0|I love this app! It's fun to do and passes time quickly. It's free so you have nothing to lose. The only problem is that the touch response is very sensitive. But other than that, it's a great game and time passer. =)
B005K17RU0|5.0|This is a great app! I love being able to check weather with one click ... anytime,  anywhere! Would be better if the radar would run right, always skips!
B003XOAJ6K|5.0|This is an awesome remaster with a second disc of remixes and some previously unreleased material.  The first disc includes the original studio track of Drug, that was nixed from the original 1988 release and replaced with the \\"remixed\\" version that the record label preferred instead.  The remixed version is included on disc 2.  The 12\\" version of Big Thing, which was previously unreleased, is an awesome track!  The sound quality of the digital remaster is far superior than the 1988 release.  Don't get excited over disc 3.  The DVD concert from 1988 looks like it came from tape rather than film.  So the video quality is pretty poor.  The box set is nice with some picture cards and liner notes.  The best part is that I got mine from an Amazon seller for $17 that noted the condition as used, but it was still shrink wrapped!
B005XQLBU4|1.0|the missiles were small and didn't go where they were suppose to. the graphics in the game were ok, not the best, but the game play is lacking.
034552554X|4.0|The story is about a young woman just emancipated from the foster care system who discovers she has an extraordinary talent for flowers.  The book flips from past to present and back, illustrating her past and current relationships.  The book is powerfully readable, and I was glued to the pages all weekend.  The definitions of the flower types (especially the index at the end) were especially interesting. The characters were engaging, though sometimes maddening (especially Elizabeth).  The part that started to lose me was the fantastic, fairy-tale quality Victoria has for understanding flowers and finding success.  She's given almost psychic ability to discern a bride's every wish, based on a few words.  She's very young and formerly homeless, yet somehow manages to pull together a business with a line of affluent brides around the block.  Then, she finds an asstant - another emancipated foster care woman - who has almost the super-human powers of understanding.  It strained credibility a bit, but was still very entertaining to read.
B00632HWOG|5.0|For the people saying you cant see more then fifteen emails at one time when using this app on the Kindle Fire, flip your device around and use it that way, then when you get to the bottom of the page keep scrolling and your emails will load. Or, log onto your Yahoo account through the Internet and upgrade it to the latest version. I use this app on my Fire and it works perfectly, makes checking my mail so fast and easy!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Mind numbing fun. A great way to fill in time while waiting for an appointment or when you do not have a Reader's Digest for those contemplative times.
B003Q7B78S|5.0|One of the writers of the Bloomsbury group, Virginia was an integral part of the creative genius that poured from the minds of the time and the place called Bloomsbury. This is not a standard fare book or movie. It was a very clever story that like many times I liked the book better than the movie but the movie was great nonetheless. The frost faire in the beginning of the movie was wonderful being fully captured by the actress Tilda Swinton acting in a different role than normal as a young man falling madly in love in a strange circumstance. Humorous and interesting movie for a movie different than your standard fare. I love it.
B0001I561E|1.0|I ordered from this merchant and they sent the product though Amazon gives them a ridiculously long time to have it delievered.  Other items in the same order were received weeks ago and orders made weeks after have already arrived.  This is just sad.  Horrible seller
0525478817|5.0|As a 30something who has been a voracious reader since preadolescence, that's no small feat.  I love John Green, but his work has not blown me away until now.  This book is far superior to his others in terms of complexity, poignancy, and emotional impact.  Usually I love books and they are good while they last, and I move on quickly and rarely look back.  This is the first book since The Hobbit that I want to read over and over again.  I don't mark books but I felt the urge to highlight because some of his lines were so unbelievably well-written.  I would recommend this book to anyone, any age.  SO good. DFTBA
B005HSL626|5.0|I have this game on my windows phone, and I loved it, when I got my kindle fire, I saw it in the appstore &amp; I got it, &amp; it is AMAZING!!!!!!
0143119680|2.0|This book was recommended to me by a friend who also likes to read, and she knows I enjoy stories with supernatural forces at work. I mentioned having read Nora Roberts' The Circle Trilogy about five years ago during interrogation, and she suggested this one. I went against my better judgement by purchasing the book without researching fellow Amazonians' opinions, and once again, like Calvin from the comics, I was forced to add another name to the list of people who piss me off.<br /><br />Not really. Her heart was in the right place.<br /><br />Briefly, the story concerns the adventure, if you will, of an academic who is also a witch by lineage. She denies her ties to the magical world, determined to prove that she can succeed in the normal world, without the help of her special powers. What failed from the beginning for me, was the nature of the character herself. She is reminiscent of so many of those heroic ex-commando types in masculine-oriented fiction, where the guy was the youngest in his class, the toughest, adored by women, blah, blah, boring. The witch herein is beautiful, young for her endless academic doctoral achievements, was, but gave up, an acting career that would have led to greatness, is weathy or will unwillingly inherit lots, runs miles every day when the weather prevents her rowing on the waterways around Oxford, respected by everyone, practically ducking or at least avoiding eye contact from the entire world around her. I can only guess that she is a feminine version of the typical Clive Cussleresque creation. By the way, she is from a prominent witching family, revered in that world as well...<br /><br />If you can surround that character with a fantasy world that is intriguing, perhaps a home run would've been scored. Instead, the writer twists and tangles the legends of vampires and daemons, to fill in the background, but in such a manner as to cheapen interest in them - not bring out the enigmatic possibilities of such well known fictional icons. In a word, the story was boring, and in fact tedious to read.<br /><br />A big difference between, for example, Nora Roberts' Circle Trilogy and this work, comes in the form of simple conversation, the banter between characters. Roberts is witty and suggestive, while filling out the world she's created in detail, without explaining everything to death.<br /><br />I see that a lot of people like this story from the reviews, but I also see a great many were either indifferent to it or disliked it. This is not Willow from Buffy or Hermione Granger, but rather a dull academic blithering about endlessly looking for sympathy.
B005BW0YIK|4.0|Many bands fall in to the same routine that 3 Doors Down has (Nickelback, Bon Jovi, Breaking Benjamin, etc).  While I still like this album a lot, the songs start sounding the same as their old ones.  My girlfriend started singing the wrong lyrics in the car by mistake and said \\"This song sounds just like Here Without You!\\"  If you like traditional hits from 3 Doors Down then you'll like this album as well.  Has some great rocking tunes and power ballads!
B00026WU4G|5.0|This is an album for grown ups released over 20 years after he burst on the scene. The re-mastered version especially shines where you can clearly hear all the production further back in the mix. It's very 80s but at the same time it has a bit of 60's rock in it. The up front super-reactive drum production annoys some and I was one of those a few years back but I've come round to enjoying this album all the way through now. Lyrically there is a loose theme of 'Man' or 'Mankind' the flipside of the more overtly God oriented albums preceding. \\"Now he worships at an altar of a stagnant pool, And when he sees his reflection, he's fulfilled....\\" - that line pretty much sums up the album for me. His albums from 62 - 83 are of consistently astonishing quality showcasing wide ranging vocal abilities the like of which we may not hear again in our lifetimes. I for one absolutely want to hear every track here although it took me a while to get to that point. Where are 'Lord Protect My Child', 'Tell Me' 'Foot Of Pride' and 'Blind Willie McTell'?  They were all recorded during the Infidels sessions so a wonderful third side can be found on the bootleg series album - vol 3. My theory is Dylan didn't want 'God' mentioned at the point he put the album out but God is still here in spades between the lines throughout this album. Perhaps that theory is daft. Needless to say, those four tracks are flat out great as well. The album as released though is great and has grown on me more than any other Dylan album and i think is generally speaking very underated by the Dylan fan base although it's each to their own of course.  The guy can sing. What can you say?  ps. good to know Bob get's his belt buckles at this site
B004ZRV3AU|4.0|After several attempts on different styles of bottles we finally have the wine bottle glasses I wanted.  Now to drink a little more wine and add to my collection!  Do read the directions!  Do oil the cutter!  Be careful not to score over an area already cut!  When you do it right it works!  I would like advice on polishing the rims of the glasses!  Any help would be appreciated!
0439023491|4.0|I'm compelled to write a partial review immediately. THE AGE ADVISORY OF NOT RECOMMENDED FOR KIDS YOUNGER THAN 13 IS THERE FOR A GOOD REASON.<br /><br />Come on parents. Restrain your kids. My 5th grade daughter and I both read and enjoyed the heck out of Hunger Games and I'm reading Catching Fire ahead of her. No way am I allowing her to read this. The book is far too suggestive for kids younger than 13 and there are plenty of kids out there younger than 13 reading the trilogy, which makes me sad. If your child younger than 13 has read it, and you have not, then you need to read it and have an honest discussion with your child.<br /><br />Sleeping with your friend and \\"nothing happened?\\" At any age that is where confusion, and ultimately really regretable mistakes happen. The book celebrates a friendship yet allows Katniss and Peeta to cuddle and sleep together despite a love triangle, ***SPOILER ALERT*** and ultimately start the rumor that she is pregnant. Kids who are friends should not be sleeping together and a book that uses this to move along the plot and basically encourage this behavior is sending a confusing message to kids who don't know better. PARENTS:  At least pay attention to the age advisory on this book. A discussion is a good idea.<br /><br />I haven't finished it and am enjoying it a great deal. But it should not be approved for younger audiences.
B001U3Y5XE|3.0|The idea of this game (building what the cards tell you) seems really fun & interactive, but the reality is, it takes too long for each person to build his/her object & the kids got bored too easily.  Also, the \\"Easy\\" Cards were not always so easy.  Some of the \\"easy\\" objects should've been categorized differently.  Overall this toy is just \\"ok\\".
1451627289|5.0|lifelong stephen king fan. my parents watched the dead zone over and over when i was a kid and with enough begging they let me watch it. i proceeded to have nightmares for years after i saw the dead guy in the tub twitching with the scissors...but i was taken with the premise.  my second favorite became the stand (although he sort of lost me with the hand of God coming down in vegas). ingeneous plots, but sometimes i feel like he gets himself stuck and either has to do something crazy or gets bored. but i've always thought it must be fun to be able to think that stuff up...  anyway i've read most of his stuff over the years and his voice is familiar, like an old friend.  i bought this one on a whim in an airport before a long flight.  i've been so taken with the idea, the way he lays it out and catches all the details - i've been pacing myself, just digging it (and a little afraid of being crestfallen with the end).  but last night i meandered through the last forty pages.  brilliant. unpredictable. i was...ok, i was totally crying.  so moving.  if you only read one stephen king novel let it be this one.  mr. king you've outdone yourself.  'blood calls to blood, heart calls to heart.  like all sweet dreams, it will be brief. but brevity makes sweetness doesn't it?  because when the time is gone you can never get it back.'
B005XQLBU4|5.0|very nice app reminds me of the good ole days love the difficulty increase with there were more levels on the perks
B005LLSLPE|5.0|I love this show and I'm addicted 100%. It's perfect to me in every aspect.  It keeps me involved, and there's always so much going on.  To that person complaining about Tara - Tara was already in the club years earlier because her and Jax dated when they were 16. So that's why she's so committed. She got a job as a doctor/surgeon because she went to school while in Chicago. So that's why it seems to be so weird. She doesn't look young at all. She looks her age. Now shut up and keep watching it.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|What a great (free) application.  Easy to use on the Kindle Fire.  I was very pleasently surprised.  You can even take your Kindle to church if you wish.  Easy and fast way to fine chapter and verse of the complete Bible.

B003ZHVJFK|2.0|I was totally disappointed when I watched this movie. The action didn't live up hype or even came to the level of action noted in the video games. The selection of fighters was highly questionable as well as their fight scenes. There was more action in the general stunts rather than the actual fights. This was a let down. They could have used CGI to display more complex fighters e.g. Jacks (weak- used average people in military-Goth gear), Yoshimitsu (weak-used a stunt man non MA), King (not in the movie)), but they didn't.  Did I say this movie was a down. However, if you are a collector of Gary Daniels movies you might want to add this to your collection. Gary plays Bryan Fury. The casting for this movie was about 40% on target, the use of the martial artist was highly questionable. There was a lot of open space i.e. lag time scenes and not enough action. It didn't keep my attention. I stopped and pulled out one of my reference books to go over my notes at times. My wife had to ask me to watch this with her. It was disappointing when you are suppose to have highly skilled MA fighters like Nina Williams and you have her and her sister in a questionable position (unless you are twisted and have no moral you may like this suggestive scene). Martial Law's fight scenes were also questionable. Steve Scott's role was questionable and  you have an unknown Russian fighter not in any of the games in the movie. This movie was a \\"miss\\",  much like the movie \\"Hulk\\" directed by Ang Lee.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|I will have to say that although I am an avid reader, I have never read anything like this book. It's definitely one of my all-time favorites! The story is unique, the glimpses of NK life, and the characters all combine for a tale you won't want to put down, but won't want to finish. Well worth the money!
B000JMLFLW|5.0|Remembered reading this in high school and not fully understanding a lot of the complex issues raised in this book. It's nice to have another read at an older age to appreciate the author's words, and have a better understanding of what makes this such a classic book.
B0063GORYU|4.0|Good app. but I don't understand the auto placement of cards . Place your own cards for least moves. Hard to put down.
B0055EDCGU|4.0|Although this album can't hold a candle to Shogun, this is a great follow-up.  From beginning to end, this album is packed with good songs, that are awesome when played live.
B001TWT0AE|5.0|This film never looked any better. Great transfer and sound quality. While extras are usually wasted on me I did enjoy hearing from Stuart, John Ford and most of all Lee Marvin. If you like this movie as I do this is the release you are looking for.

B003MQLRNI|5.0|The Collins classics version is outstanding.  It's inexpensive ($6 or so when I purchased), though compact it is very legible.  The paper is thick enough so that the font on the other side doesn't show through.  Binding is tight though the spine gets bent quite a lot even after one read through.  What I particularly enjoyed was the Collins classic English literature dictionary in the back.  It includes many outdated or no longer used terms and words so that you don't have to reach for the computer if you don't really know what an 'entail' is or what 'persnickety' means.  But it is a compact, standard mass market paperback size, and that's my one beef.<br /><br />As for the novel. Classic English literature is amazing, and this novel is one of the cornerstones of the 19th century English literature scene.  Along with Dickens and the Bronte sisters, Austen's novels seem to capture the lives of the English in these times.  Though Pride and Prejudice deals mainly with the wealthy, or at least the privileged class, we get to see a wonderful story unfold.  Like the title states, this story deals with the pride of one character and the prejudice of another.  Many peripheral plots unfold and help add to the overall story while the main plot moves along quite well.<br /><br />It's a novel that is often placed on reading lists in school, though I feel that in reading this in my early 30s that I can really truly grasp the emotions and trials of these characters more completely.  If you read this when young, then do yourself a service and re-read this novel.  It's amazing!  Then watch the Colin Firth BBC series.

B005WMADYE|5.0|This should be required viewing for anyone who appreciates animation as an art.  The hand-drawn work put into this would be astounding in any age, and is more so in our age of over-hyped 3D spectaculars.  Add to that a very well choreographed sound track.  Some critics fault the lack of plot development and character development, but I feel it is just fine the way it is.  In the end its all about the race to the finish.  The rest can be left to one's imagination to determine what motivates them / why they are there.  The main reason I posted this review is to recommend that my fellow english speakers NEED to see the dubbed version.  Many english-speaking anime fans I know can be very purist with their attitude toward sub-titled versus dubbed viewing.  I must agree I've heard some awful dubbed work, and some can be down-right painful to listen too.  Also the differences between subs and dubs can be quite funny.  That said, the dub of Red Line is well done in my opinion.  I'm not the quickest reader in the world, but I was amazed after watching the dub how much detail I had missed the first time viewing the sub because I was too busy reading.  This movie is a visual feast.  Some might find it a stretch of a comparison, but I was reminded of the first time I saw Heavy Metal.  So get it, pop some popcorn, kick back, shut your brain off and enjoy. :)
1891252089|5.0|As someone new to yoga I was unfamiliar with many of the primary positions. I bought this book and it has all of the traditional names for the positions and the \\"western\\" names. It has a variety of moves from conquering the primary series to beginner moves and anything in between a position may have. The positions are shown clearly so that you see and understand where your body is supposed to be. Highly recommend! I also bought the David Swenson DVD and this guide has really helped go through the sessions easier.
014312093X|4.0|Complex story, quick read and hard to put down.  Very, very English--almost need to a guide to English terminology, but once you get your mind set for the dialoge, it is fairly easy to follow.  Facinating story about the cold war era, which seems so long ago and forgotten now, but was so an omnipresent during much of my lifetime.<br />Great story, look past any anti-American aspects, and chalk it up to memories of a faded empire and scorn for colonial upstarts.
B001AVCFK6|5.0|The item came as described with the casing and all of the discs inside.  It was as new as you can get without having the wrapping still on it.  The disks are in perfect shape with no scratches at all. I've already played the movie and it worked perfectly with no problems at all.

B0057ZEMF2|2.0|I was introduced to Anoushka when I bought \\"Rise\\" without any initiation, just because she's the daughter of the famous Sitar Maestro. \\"Rise\\" is still my favorite of all time,and of all albums! It was unique, melodious, and soul filling. The songs were better than sex!  The following album, \\"Breathing Underwater\\" was a bit spoilt with techno or house infusion; nevertheless was still highly soothing to the ears. It still sounded like Anoushka.   Now, \\"Traveller\\". I bought it with no hesitation because I'm just an avid fan of Anoushka. First time listening, I did not like the music at all, 2nd time still no trigerrs in my heart, 3rd time and finally 4th time...i decided I'm not going to try to like this Album anymore. The spanish infusion to Indian music doesn't jive well for me. All songs felt unoriginal and seemed like a lame attempt to create a new \\"Genre\\". Anyhow, for the love of Anoushka, I will attempt to listen to them 2-3 more times. maybe in a few more weeks time....
B0010V4TZU|5.0|The music on \\"Vampire Weekend\\" is creative, melodic, exciting, catchy, memorable, well played and different from anything else. Each song gives pleasure through repeated listens. A definite \\"desert island\\" album for me, and I've been around a while (40 years), so getting on my desert island list isn't easy.  I'm actually more into classical music than rock, and this band appeals to the classical side of me. The band infuses its music with classical elements, notably the Bach-style open to \\"M79.\\" I get the feeling that Ezra Koenig and his bandmates are pretty familiar with classical music, as they are with African and Caribbean, and I love how the various styles show up in their songs. The lyrics fit the songs nicely. None of the lyrics are trite, silly love song stuff, and some are pretty funny. The band gets made fun of for being college-educated highbrows, but as one myself, this aspect of VW appeals to me.  My favorite cuts are: Mansard Roof, Oxford Comma, M79, A-Punk and Walcott, but I love them all. Once I heard A-Punk on the radio a few times, I knew I had to buy the album.  I also like their second album, \\"Contra,\\" though perhaps not as much. I would still highly recommend it.  And I wish very much that they'd put out a third. I'm not entirely sure what sort of follow-up they could do to these two fine discs, but I can't wait to find out, and I have high hopes.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|This is a great Bible reading app with almost every version. The only problem I have is many features require nonlinear access, making it very limited otherwise.
B0025UHKNS|4.0|Nice size as compared to the 305. Seems less affected by rain than the 305. Accurate mileage calculations and comfortable heart rate strap. Easy to use and program, just be aware of how sensative the bezel is.  The price made this a great value. I recommend it. Of course it does noone any good unless they use it.....so get out there and run!!!

B003L77GRO|4.0|Dexter's home life tragically came apart at the end of Season 4. How could the writers begin to top that intense season? Well, they did it as we continue to dig deeper into Dexter's psyche. The rules set up by his dad are evolving. Dexter is now showing emotion and will emotions cause him to make a careless mistake and finally get caught?  Dexter is beginning to have feelings--his own versions of grief, sadness, joy, regret, and love. The writers take us on am amazing journey this season as we discover a new serial killer is menacing Miami. Poor Miami never seems to get a break. Their serial killings are rarely solved as the suspects disappear and the killings - all thanks to the work of Dexter. He is always one step ahead of his coworkers, especially his sister Deb who is particularly good at using her instincts to uncover the killer. It's Dexter's job to sabotage an investigation if the homicide team is getting too close to finding the killer.  This season's star is the lovely Julia Stiles as Lumen. DEXTER has had some great guest stars throughout the seasons. Stiles brings a bit of humanity to Dexter. She lights up the screen with her beauty and passion, but what is the passion that she shares with Dexter? Dexter is motivated by his need to kill while following his father's \\"rules.\\" Lumen has the need for revenge and closure. The two clash and collide and come together as one. The transformation in Dexter is remarkable. He and Lumen need each other and their chemistry is electrifying. I have to be vague in my review so as not to give away any details. Suffice to say that the viewer is in for some major surprises and the writers take us on an amazing journey. Twists and turns abound. It can get comical, at times, to see how Dexter comes within inches of being discovered and leaves unscathed. The writers did a fantastic job this season and I want more DEXTER!

B004MC8CA2|5.0|such an amazing app! I love it so much. I'm trying to read every night and this helps a ton!
0525478817|5.0|First off, I should point out that I am twenty-four years old and I therefore do not fit into the typical \\"young adult\\" reader category.  But that is one of the beautiful things about this book, as well as John Green's other books - age does not particularly matter.  The themes explored in this novel - love, friendship, illness, grief, the desire for meaning - are all universal, so I can say with a great deal of certainty that anyone at any stage in their life can appreciate this story and these characters.<br /><br />This story is not about cancer.  Above everything else, it is a love story and it is filled with Green's celebrated profundity and heart.  The imagery is so powerful that, by the end, I felt that I had intimately known these people, and greatly wished that I did.  It is a book that I, and I'm sure many others, will be rereading and rerereading, etc, because it left me wanting to see more adventures with Hazel and to get lost in Augustus's goofy smile for just a little longer.

1451627289|3.0|Here be spoilers, so beware!  As a big fan of history and time travel novels as well, I really did enjoy this book, however, as the title of my review suggests, I do have some bones to pick with the author that have nothing to do with his political agenda.  Even as a political conservative, I was not bothered, as were other readers here, by the portrayals of the hateful, gun-toting, bigots and bluenoses in this book.  I guess I call this artistic license as this WAS a book of fiction.  However, a few of the characters and plot points made me lose focus and start to re-write the book in my head.  To wit:  1. The fight between Dick Tiger and Henry Case.  The actual result of this fight was a decision win for Tiger, a future two-time Middleweight and Light Heavyweight Champion at a time when there were only eight titleholders. How Al's or Jake's trips to the past would alter the action in the ring to allow an aging club fighter to knock out a world class fighter like Tiger escapes me.  No way Jake or Sadie's cheering could distract anyone in the ring as they watched the fight via a closed-circuit telecast.  2. Sadie's character.  Making her obsessed with sex didn't bother me as much as her foul-mouthed, middle finger-giving, \\"kiss my ass\\"  persona.  I didn't see this in keeping with a refined, college-educated Southern woman of the 1950s.  3. The forwardness of several of the African-American characters, particularily the large woman on the bus in Dallas.  In several instances, King points out the racism (and sexism) of the Southern whites, however, he has a large black woman giving the bus driver and his passengers a dressing down.  4.  Last, and the most disconcerting;  Do you really believe that the FBI would let the man who saved the President of the United State's life by firing a handgun, with his fiancee/accomplice shot dead, having false documents and no identity whatsover get away scot-free???  The implications are astounding.  Was George/Jake with the C.I.A.,the Russians?  He would have been locked up \\"for his own safety\\" until the powers that be figured out who/what he was.  Don't get me wrong, I did enjoy this book and it would make a GREAT movie.  How about releasing it on 11/22/13, fifty years after that fateful day when I was 10 years old and heard the news on TV from my sickbed and thought I was dreaming.
1608193381|1.0|Upon reading the table of contents of this book, I knew from the start what the world view of this author was - statism pure and simple.  His socialistic tendencies show through each chapter especially those where he speaks of \\"shoulds\\" and \\"oughts.\\"  These are words of elitism from past decades and centuries.  This is Maxism dressed up in modern clothing.  Nothing new here.<br /><br />The author is simply a copy cat of old, failed, and stale economics that have never worked and never will.  He looks to government control to make decisions for those whom he says can't make decisions.  To this author, the general population is unable to decide for themselves.  The shadows of Thomas More and Thomas Hobbes have reappeared in this book - an elitist class deciding for all the paupers and minions who own nothing and look to this elite ruling class to provide them with everything.<br /><br />This author doesn't realize that Keynes is dead and will never resurrect.  He also doesn't realize that it was government that caused the latest big recession and not the business cycle.  Greenspan betrayed his own principles through manipulation of interest rates, giving a false message to business for investment in their projects, thinking there was sufficient capital.  Reno and Clinton forced banks to lend to uncreditworthy people and popped the housing market.  Obama made it worse with his \\"stimulus\\" packages that left the rivate sector wilting while his cronies and unions made off with government money.  He is also doing the same thing Clinton did, fining banks for not lending to people who can't afford a mortgage.  This beckons for another bust.  Yes tell us again about your 23 things they don't tell you about capitalism.  Each statement is loaded with faulty premises and \\"shoulds\\" and \\"oughts\\" much like Marxism of bad days gone by.<br /><br />ADDITIONAL REVIEW<br /><br />This is a fresh review that tackles some of the more massive errors and logical fallacies with Ha-Joon Chang's book 23 Things They Don't Tell You About Capitalism.  I will take the time to address the salient points in his book that not only demonstrate that he is a very poor writer but also that his knowledge of capitalism generally and the Austrian School specifically is subpar or worse.  Consequently, his argument begins on a weak foundation.<br /><br />This book caught my attention because I believe and participate in the free market capitalism that Chang claims does not exist.  Yes, Mr. Chang, there is free market in spite of you pronouncing it dead.  I will address this in due course in my analysis of his book.<br /><br />THE NEBULOUS \\"THEY\\"<br /><br />From the title of his book onward, Chang discusses this plural \\"they\\" without being specific about whom he speaks.  In reading the Introduction, it seems that this \\"they\\" could be referring to \\"free-marketeers.\\"  Then again, Chang cites no particular economist or professional (except perhaps Milton Friedman, and Friedman is not the sum of the proponents of free-markets.  Far from it!), which leaves this \\"they\\" hanging there in space without any reference whatsoever.  Since this is the case, Chang begins his long string of logical fallacies, the first being the straw man.  He sets up this straw man at the beginning of each chapter and starts kicking it around with perplexing eyes looking on wondering exactly what he is doing.  However, all his kicking at this straw man is simply beating the wind.  In any critique when using a third person designation, sound writing principles dictate that there should be a reference.  However, this does not stop Change from such poor writing.<br /><br />BIFURCATION OF FREE MARKETS AND CAPITALISM<br /><br />In attempting to show he is not anti-capitalist and that free markets (as he understands it) do not exist, Change creates a bifurcation of free markets and capitalism.  He writes, \\"The book is not an anti-capitalist manifesto.  Being critical of free-market ideology is not the same asbeing against capitalism...I believe that capitalism is still the best economic system that humanity has invented.  My criticism is of a particular version of capitalism that has dominated the world in the last three decades, that is, free-market capitalism\\" (Introduction, xv).<br /><br />This bifurcation demonstrates his ignorance of capitalism and that he has never read the Austrian School economic theories.  Where he gets this bifurcated version of economics is nowhere noted in his book.  The reason for its absence is that such capitalism does not exist.  He invented this straw man so he could create a bifurcation.  Without free markets, capitalism would not exist.  Capitalism depends on the freedom to own, create capital, produce goods and services from this capital, and exchange property within the economy.  Capitalism derives from capital, that is, the basis for productivity.<br /><br />George Reisman, a very close friend of Ludwig Von Mises and many other Austrian economists, describes capitalism as, \\"...a social system based on private ownership of the means of production.  It is characterized by the pursuit of material self-interest (NOT selfishness) under freedom (my italics)...Based on its foundation and essential nature, capitalism is further characterized by saving and capital accumulation, exchange and money...the profit motive, the freedom of economic competition...economic progress, and a harmony of the material self-interests of all the individuals who participate in it\\" (Economics and Capitalism, p.19).  Free markets is the bedrock of capitalism, but Chang's ignorance of economics prevents him from recognizing this.  He cannot get to capitalism without beginning with free markets.  Therefore, if he is anti-free market, he must necessarily be anti-capitalist.<br /><br />NO SUCH THING AS FREE MARKETS?<br /><br />According to Chang, free markets do not exist (Thing 1).  How does he know this?  He says so.  To him, these \\"free-marketeers\\" only came about during the 1980's.  In his dreams they did.  What he does not realize that free markets have been around as long as humanity has been on the earth, and it has not disappeared.  As long as people own property, create capital from it, and conduct transactions, freedom exists in the exchange of goods and services.  The government may attempt to place restrictions on freedom through taxation and regulation, but humanity's ingenuity shines the brightest when this happens.  They discover means of creating free markets as Adam Smith discussed concerning the early centuries of Great Britain.  The only way to wipe out free markets is through absolute dictatorship and totalitarianism with no recourse of it ever returning, which makes all peoples paupers.  That has never happened in the course of human history.  Different dynasties attempted this, and their dynasties disappeared.  However, Chang's straw man of his version of free market prevents him from recognizing history.<br /><br />THE SHOULD AND OUGHT MENTALITY<br /><br />Chang engages in an elitist mentality by using \\"should\\" and \\"ought\\" (Thing 3).  In his thingy 3, his title informs us of his proscriptive anti-capitalistic ideology when he states outright that \\"Most people in rich countries are paid more than they should be.\\"  Oh really!  Who determines this?  What he then writes does not even support this conclusion.  One example is that \\"most workers in rich countries could be, and would be (italics mine) replaced by workers from poor countries.  Really?  Says who?  Chang?  There is no discussion of division of labor, skill, and supply and demand.  It will just happen.<br /><br />He then tells a story about something being more expensive lends to it being \\"better.\\"  This he launches against free market capitalism on the basis of price differentiation between different societies rather than on the basis of the activities of free markets, competition, and wealth creation.  Chang ignores all of the principles of capitalism that reflect reality and fails to even discuss them. He provides no discussion or analysis of supply and demand, capital creation, or competition and how these lead to growth and wealth creation.  Rather, he simply sets up his straw man of his idea of \\"free markets\\" and viciously attacks it, using bifurcaton to splice free market from capitalism to create his idea of capitalism that has no basis in the free exchange of property or the liberty of property ownership.  Since he bifurcates these two concepts, he has no basis for capitalism.  It just hangs out there like fruit without branches to hold it.  This is complete nonsense.  His story of Sven and Ram ignores market principles.  It has to, because if Chang admitted that these principles existed, they would demolish his straw man \\"free market\\" ideology.  Supply and demand in competitive free markets determine product and service value and drive prices down not up.  However, Chang's blinders prevent him from understanding these economic principles so evident in free market capitalism.<br /><br />CONCLUSION<br /><br />I could comment on each subsequent chapter and the nonsense he discusses in each, but the above examples demonstrate that Chang knows little of principles of economics and has no understanding of free markets or capitalism.  He hangs up numerous straw men and begins whacking at them.  One of these straw men is Adam Smith, one whom Chang said assumed the worst of individuals and set the stage for that mentality to be passed on.  Chang quotes Smith out of context (Thingy 5) and disregards that The Wealth of Nations actually arose from a previous work The Theory of Moral Sentiments in which Smith elevated individuals by positing in them the high qualities of ethics, virtue, liberty, and individual and private rights.  Chang does not understand Smith or his works.  I doubt that he ever read Smith.  Consequently, he misunderstands Smith's self-interest principle and invisible hand but rather accuses him and those who follow him of being selfish.<br /><br />What he does not realize is that these straw men are concoctions of his own imagination and have nothing to do with the real world.  Chang's book has a place...in a trash heap.out during the 1980's.  In his dreams they did.

0143039601|5.0|This is the first Kerouac book i ever read. I've read it twice, once when i was 17, and once when i was 19. It's a beautifully poetic look at Jack's life (he calls himself Ray Smith in this one) while he was riding the rails, hitching, hiking and camping across the southern United States and Mexico. This book, along with On the Road, is one of Kerouac's more fantastical works. Though he always tends to focus on both the good and the bad of his journeys, Dharma Bums does carry an underlying current that Jack was able to achieve some kind of Zen Buddhist enlightenment at this time in his life. In that sense, there is less bad to dwell on, and life seems to work itself out more than it does in some of his more real, raw books. A great Kerouac read, and a great introduction to his style.
B000OJFV3S|5.0|Very entertaining and enjoyable.  All other Henry VIII portrayals I have seen are all an older, much heavier Henry.  I liked the way the Henry VIII character started young and then aged throughout this series.  However, I think that ANNE OF THE THOUSAND DAYS starring Richard Burton as an older Henry was an outstanding film.  I would recommend it to anyone who likes historical dramas. Richard Burton and Jonathan Rys Meyers are both exceptional actors.

B004LWZW4M|1.0|Rise of the Planet of the Apes falls flat. While the CGI ape sequences are exciting, the human element doesn't work in this incoherent reboot prequel to the Planet of the Apes Franchise. Wooden acting, bland cinematography, choppy editing and a weak story keep this film from being its best. It may be the planned start of a new franchise, but the first film out feels incomplete.<br /><br />My beef with Rise of the Planet of the Apes are with the production issues that hold the film back. The whole film feels like studio executives rushed it into production. Because of this, the storyline is extremely sloppy and poorly executed. The screenplay has some of the weakest dialogue I've ever seen executed onscreen. Me being a writer I actually cringed hearing some of the lines being spoken as they were so clich&eacute;. The script felt like a first draft and should have been revised.<br /><br />The human characters in this story are paper thin and one-dimensional, bordering on cartoonish. Their lack of depth and complexity kept me from connecting with anyone in this story on a human level. I guess that's  to make the CGI apes look more alive and seem multi-dimensional, but it slows down the pace of the film and keeps it from having the emotional impact it could have had. The scenes with the apes have the emotional impact they're supposed to, but the human actors aren't given what they need to work with. Rise of the Planet of the Apes really needed a human element to connect the viewer to the story and that heart and soul is missing from this film.<br /><br />Cinematically, the editing is absolutely horrible. I had to wonder if they hired Lee Daniels or Tyler Perry's editor, because the choppy transitions between scenes keep the film from flowing smoothly. Without those transitional scenes to bridge between events the progression of the story feels mechanical instead of organic.<br /><br />I feel like they built the story around the special effects instead of the story. Yeah, the CGI apes are amazing. They have the best scenes in the story. But the finished film feels incomplete, uneven and ends on a flat note.<br /><br />Rise of the Planet of the Apes didn't get a rise out of me. It's a rental at best.scenes in the story. But the finished film feels incomplete, uneven and ends on a flat note.  Rise of the Planet of the Apes didn't get a rise out of me. It's a rental at best.

0525478817|5.0|The kind of story you'd expect to be featured alongside other popular love stories such as the Notebook. It is beautiful in all aspects. It is easy (and hard, once you've stopped crying) on the eyes. To put it shortly, the word \\"okay\\" will never be just \\"okay,\\" to me any more, and for that I am EXTREMELY grateful to John Green.

0307949486|5.0|The strength of this book lies in Lisbeth Salander.  She is an enigmatic person who the reader, her boss  Armansky, and Blomkvist,  her future work companion, have a difficult time figuring out. What motivates this character? What happened in her past? These are questions that all three would like to know as the book proceeds. Yes, as some critics have stated there is a lot of time devoted to set up, but the reader is always hoping we catch more glimpses of Salander because she is so riveting. When she extracts revenge, Larsson makes you feel Lisbeth's satisfaction, and you admire Salander's  ingenuity, toughness, honesty, and courage. She is one of the best fictional characters ever invented, and makes the reader put up with Larsson's plodding pace. One criticism I have of the book is the action scenes are well written, but way too short. In spite of the pace, I highly recommend this book since the girl with the dragon tattoo is so fascinating.

B001LA3LYU|2.0|The DTS-MA recording on the Blu-Ray is so compelling (5 stars) I wanted this album in mp3 format for the car too.  What a disappointment.  The mp3 transfer is awful.  The excellent bass performance is muddled and lost.  Some of the best tracks are omitted as well.  Good thing it was on sale.  Should have just ripped the BD.
B001VLXNLU|1.0|The story was OK. The writing was OK. The blatant Marxist agenda that permeates this series is not OK. (Makes me think the \\"PC\\" in \\"PC Cast\\" stands for Politically Correct, which is a soft term for Marxism.)  The author did not simply describe certain points of Marxism, she lets the reader know that anyone who does not hate the nuclear family, Christianity, and men* is subhuman. (*Homosexual men are exempt from hating men, but they'd better see women as superior beings.) Anyone who does not embrace and elevate to a supreme position homosexuality, feminism, and paganism is an intolerant hater. She allows no freedom of thought or opinion; if you don't agree with her agenda, the author labels you an ignorant hater.  If you enjoy having agendas shoved down your throat, this series is for you. Just don't eat before reading, because PC Cast shoves platters full of agenda down the reader's throat. If you enjoy hating free-thinking people with varying opinions, this series is for you. If you enjoy reading hate-filled fiction as fact, this series spews loads of it.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Fun games and easy gameplay make this a good app to use when you are bored and need to pass time.

B003EYVXVY|5.0|Having never been privileged enough to catch Avatar in 3D on the big screen,let alone digital theater, it was a given for me that this beautiful film would eventually make its way into my Blu Ray collection. I could say I was in a coma but fact being stranger than fiction, I live in a tiny town in Idaho so naturally, no IMAX.  When I heard Cameron planned on releasing an Extended Version to Blu Ray, of course, this only served to whet my appetite further but, just before I bit the bullet and paid the whopping $40 asking price, something wonderful happened.  3D home theater technology became more affordable and this Christmas past, I was fortunate enough to have been gifted with a bundle including the LG PZ550 3D Plasma [[ASIN:B004LU1N1A LG 50PZ550 50-Inch 1080p 600 Hz Active 3D Plasma HDTV with Internet Applications]] (astonishing television by the way..LG is highly recommended if you're in the 3D market this year) and a Panasonic 3D BDT210 blu ray player [[ASIN:B004G8HXXO Panasonic DMP-BDT210 Integrated-Wi-Fi 3D Blu-ray DVD Player]].  Combined, these two pieces of technology make for a full 1080p 3D experience just short of having IMAX at home.  I encourage you though, please do your research.  Although the LG Plasma 3D TV's have arguably the best picture quality on the market, the glasses are pricey as the plasma requires active vs. passive, 3D technology.  If you're in the market, but barely, and you have many people who will be joining you for ESPN and other 3D treats, I suggest going with passive 3D as the image quality to price ratio trade off is probably well worth it in hindsight.  A single pair of active glasses for my tv runs anywhere from $80 to $100 or more [[ASIN:B004P52OAK LG AG-S250 3D Active Shutter Glasses for 2011 LG 3D Plasma HDTVs]](they are literally tiny dual LCD screens) while passive glasses (like what you get at theaters)can come in sets of 4 to 10 [[ASIN:B005G10HU6 Toshiba FPTP100UP Part Pack 3D Glasses]], ideal for family and friends and priced around 40 dollars for the bundle.  I know right....?  But as of this review, it is not possible to get a true 1080p 3D image using passive technology.  Anyway on to this release.  This blu ray was an incentive for purchasing a qualifying Panasonic 3D blu ray player.  The one aforementioned can now be found for less than $100 if you look around and will offer a voucher for Avatar 3D until Spring 2012, when the 3D version finally makes its way to retail.  This version includes the extended footage which, much like Peter Jackson did with Lord of the Rings, Cameron uses to full advantage to flesh out the story and characters.  (Sorry George Lucas, love SW but you let us all down with that awful mess of a prequel trilogy).  Cameron's genius and imagination are combined to create the Pandora which we have all come to know and love.  The use of his uniquely developed 3D camera system and seamless CGI were unprecedented in theaters and this 3D blu ray port DOES NOT DISAPPOINT.  I will readily tell you that, all told, I spent a little over $1,000 dollars building my 3D home system BUT, the market value was still a bit high and I went with top of the line everything.  That being said, having Avatar 3D on Blu Ray in my collection, far and away makes every penny worth it.  The 3D is incredible and thanks to new revolutionary 3D processors, you can actually now watch all of the nearly 3 and a half hours of this movie without the slightest headache..although..after seeing it in 3D, you may never want to leave Pandora again.  Oh and for you Avatar fans, if you're waiting for Avatar 2, don't hold your breath like you don't have a respirator pack, Cameron has just announced that the forthcoming 2 follow up films are being pushed out to Christmas 2016 and 2017 respectively.  The report says that Cameron \\"has something special in mind\\" for our return to Pandora.  I'm sure it will be well worth the wait but, in the meantime, if you love 3D and you love Avatar, this disc is a musthave.  You WILL NOT BE disappointed.

1612680011|4.0|This book represents a starting point for financial education, not the finish line. This is not a how-to book on making money and acquiring wealth. There's no magic formula or silver bullet offered here for getting rich, because, quite frankly, no such thing exists. What this book does offer is a different perspective, a different way of looking at our lives when it comes to our relationship with money. That is it's value: to get you the reader to re-examine your own perceptions and assumptions about money and wealth. To re-examine the path each of us as individuals have taken when it comes to making, spending, and growing money. There is no short cut to acquiring wealth. It requires hard work and intelligent, informed action.  The author points out that our biggest obstacle to achieving financial independence is not our intelligence or our income level or our level of education; it is our mind as expressed in our attitudes, our emotions, and our insecurities. Motivate yourself. Educate yourself. Challenge yourself. Challenge the assumptions you have held all your life. Expect to fail at times, but always endeavor to succeed.  Approach this book with an open mind and, like everything else in life, take it with a grain of salt. I'm very glad I read the book and am ready to begin building my financial IQ.

A few days ago I thought of this situation again, and for kicks and giggles I logged on the internet with the intent of contacting the CBC about my years-old request.  Lo and behold, no contact was necessary.  I rubbed my eyes, but it was true.  The DVD transfer had been available since fall.    Now I feel like a kid at Christmas waiting on this set to arrive.  For Gould aficionados no explanation is needed.  For lovers of Bach and fine keyboard playing who aren't familiar, listen to Gould's Goldbergs or his WTC I and II.

I only bought the hard cover because it was cheaper than kindle version. That makes no sense, I save money, and I can let someone else read it when I'm done. Why can't digital delivery be appropriately priced?

B0016OLC5Q|5.0|Sean Penn's adaptation of the adventures of Christopher McCandless, who left society behind to aimlessly roam the western United States, find himself and try his hand at a life off the land in the remote Alaskan wilderness. At first preachy and morose, there's a tipping point early in the picture where I couldn't help but feel something for McCandless and his naive quest to subsist wholly on morals, philosophy and the kindness of strangers in place of tangible food and water. Presented as a sort of messiah figure, the errant youth touches the lives of a broad range of individuals over the course of his travels, preaches the gospel of live-and-let-live and uncovers the difficulties associated with the tramp's lifestyle in a society so concerned with protecting its citizenry from themselves. There's a lot to be learned from Christopher's path, both positive and negative, and Penn shies away from neither in this careful, convincing pseudo-documentary. It can be so enveloping at times that the sudden appearance of a recognizable actor or two along the way feels awkward and strange. A very solid effort with something to say, I only wonder if it may have been better served by a full cast of unknowns. Eddie Vedder's perfectly matched original soundtrack deserves a special mention.

B004EBT5CU|5.0|Adele is one of the few singers that is blessed with a true instrument which is her voice. The emotions that she conveys with her expression and phrasing is outstanding.  She sings with emotion and passion, which is not present with many vocalists today. There is no set form or pattern to her music, and it isn't manufactured to fit a certain style or predefined group. In other words it isn't canned, and this CD is refreshing. Adele and the musicians on this CD play real music.  Adele appeals to every age. She sings with true emotion that listening, really listening gets to your soul. If you are a person who enjoys music and gifted vocalists, this CD is for you. A true soul singer she is, really is!

B004LROUNG|3.0|I have read all of John Grisham's books. This book was a great disappointment. The characters were shallow and the story was disappointing. I would of liked the plot to go  into a little more depth with the whole story of the drug company. A few more twists and turns to make it more interesting. I bought the book for my Kindle. I wish I would have just borrowed it from the library as I felt it was a waste of money.

0553801473|3.0|It feels like it's time to be done.  This book is the book in the series that has the story lines that go nowhere.  A new idea is introduced, followed and GRRM finds it's not going to pan out so he ends it.  Danearys is getting really boring.  What is she going to do?  Is she going to stay in Mereen forever or go to Westeros?  What's Tyrion to do?  He's here, there and everywhere and manages to stay alive even though he's got a sharp tongue and a price on his head.  Jaime is introduced FOR ONE CHAPTER!!!  What the hell was that all about?  The wall is a mess and falling apart.  Stannis' story line just stops.  It's pretty heavy following him for awhile and then it's just done.  The one line that I really liked was Theon, but again, BIG event and then it just falls off.  Dorne is useless here.  We find that they try to join in on things, but alas they are just not too popular, strong, fun, who knows what but GRRM stops the story line there.<br /><br />I'm hoping that the next installment is A) almost done and B) better than this offering.  We'll see.

B0050SYS5A|1.0|Don't waste your money on this.  All it does is narrow the Kinect field of view and darkens the camera so with it installed, it requires stadium lighting in your living room for the Kinect to actually detect you.  It's a terrible waste of money.  Don't bother.

0312576463|5.0|I purchased Jonathan Franzen's \\"Freedom\\" in a fit of desperation.  After struggling to connect with \\"Corrections\\" and abandoning it after a hundred pages, I scoffed at the praise and love \\"Freedom\\" received when it first came out over a year ago.  In a writing class I was taking I described Franzen as my generation's most overrated writer, saying, \\"He's not bad, he's just no great white hope.\\"  Now, I can gleefully feast on my own words.  I did not buy \\"Freedom\\" because I wanted to.  I have been traveling and burned through the books I brought with me.  I staggered, desperate for entertainment, into an Italian bookshop and muttered \\"English books?  Any?\\"  My question was met a vague wave towards a small corner that carried dull reproach.  It was \\"Freedom\\" or a John Grisham book.  I almost opted for Grisham.  \\"Freedom\\" is a frustrating book.  The characters in it are largely unlikable, not because of any false characteristics, but because of their blistering humanity.  I cringed at Patty and Walter and Joey not because I did not believe them, or believe in them, but because I recognized the honesty in each oft them.  I could see pieces of me, of my friends and family, in all of Franzen's creations.  \\"Freedom\\" is brilliantly written, and Franzen's prose has a flow unlike anything I've read in a good long while.  Still, the book is punishing in many respects because of how poorly these characters treat each other.  Again, I could only think of the people in my life and how, despite their best intentions, they harm each other constantly.  Franzen's novel is a brilliant representation of a firm belief of mine: it does not take a bad person to be a bad person.  In that, these people-- characters seems light here, for you get such a complete and total overview of Franzen's creations that they really seem like people-- are not monsters, they are horribly, disgustingly human.  They forget man's incredible capacity for harming those who he loves.  They struggle, they rise anddwindle.  They hurt.  Up until the last fifty pages of \\"Freedom\\" I liked it greatly but found it to be too crushing to say that I loved it.  Franzen does something incredible in finishing off his novel.  He finds beauty, genuine beauty, in the muck and mire of the pain we, as humans, inflict.  So, yes \\"Freedom\\" is tough at times and rough in its unflinching portrayal of just how petty and sad people can be, but it is also a complete triumph.  It is a book that justifies literature in a time of easy temptation and distraction.  I could not recommend it more highly.
030788743X|5.0|I didn't expect to like this book as I have no interest in videogames or online worlds. I thought I'd  just skim through it. Instead, I just fell in love with the world of the book, the characters and their quest.<br /><br />And I got to feel clever every time I recognized a reference-  it took me about an hour to remember \\" Don't Lets Start\\" , though.<br /><br />If like me you're not an obvious memeber of the target audience, give this book a try. You may be as surprised as I was.
B003YFIUW8|2.0|I wanted so badly to love this novel. I couldn't wait to read it. And no, it wasn't the child's viewpoint that disappointed me either. I could easily understand what was trying to be conveyed, and liked seeing the world through his eyes. It's just that not a whole lot happens. Yes, this may be the point. But, the novel was incredibly boring. I found myself skipping sections desperately trying to get to something of substance. The climax was meh. Life outside the room-also anti-climatic. And the ending was touching, so that is some saving grace I guess. I get that while the characters were developed there is only so much complexity to a relationship between an adult and a young child. But, again I just found this incredibly boring, and was disappointed I didn't love it.

B005AUWY90|5.0|The Cars 2 blu-ray disk did not play. The seller, Press-play-connection, was gracious enough to offer a refund. Before we returned the disk, a friend suggested to do a firmware upgrade on our Samsung player. Went on Samsung website and looked up the model number of our player. We downloaded the proper software onto a USB. We then inserted the USB into the player's USB slot. Once the player recognized it, we followed the prompts using the remote. It worked!  So if u buy a new Blu-ray disk that does not play, be suspicious of your player first. Hope this helps.

B000OCXMAE|5.0|A lot of people hate this group, obviously named Linkin Park, now for evolving from a nu-metal band, to an alternative band, and later a band who experiments on their sound. Too bad those people are idiots who are narrow minded and can't stand when a band \\"sells out\\". Minutes to Midnight is their best album to date. It is perhaps probably one of the best albums I have ever bought, and I wasn't even expecting to like it as much.<br /><br />When I first found out about Linkin Park a few years ago, I dug their older albums Hybrid Theory and Meteora, and some stuff I heard from this album. But, a few months later, I went back to listening to Christian Rock music. Months later, I was back into secular music and I heard some more songs from Linkin Park and other bands. A few months after that, I had bought both Meteora and Hybrid Theory and liked them. But, they wore out on me pretty quickly, and I discovered that a band evolving is much better than a band staying the same. So I picked up this album just a few days prior to me writing this review, and I enjoyed this record.<br /><br />While they have changed from Meteora's nu-metal sound to a more alternative sound and do that sound justice, most of the hard-rocking stuff falls completely flat. I find these tracks to be throwaway tracks, Given Up especially. I am sorry fans, but nothing about this song sticks out at all, and just appears to be tired and worn out. On top of all of those issues, the F-bomb is thrown around in this song like a Frisbee, and all of us know about the 18-second scream that comes off as annoying. It's a good way to start off an album, but honestly, it's just a throwaway track like I said. Amongst the softer songs, the only song I find to be just decent is In Between. In this song, Mike (the emcee) takes over the vocal tracks. While his voice is good, it's not really as good as Chester's voice.<br /><br />The softer songs on here do show us what this band has to offer on the \\"alternative\\" side. These songs are Leave Out All The Rest, Shadow Of The Day, What I've Done, Valentine's Day, In Pieces, and The Little Things Give You Away. Leave Out All The Rest is my favorite track on this album. The music is well done on this song, the lyrics are great, and Chester's vocals on this particular song totally beat the vocals on songs such as Don't Stay, One Step Closer, Somewhere I Belong, From the Inside, Points of Authority, any other song that they have possibly recorded. A lead singer in a band seriously can't be screaming, \\"Shut up when I'm talking to you!\\" or, \\"The very worst part of you... IS ME!\\" for seven years, or at this rate, twelve years of his life. On top of that, the other band members can't showcase their aggressive side for that long either.<br /><br />So, this is all I have to say about the particular album. As usual, fans are not worthy enough to give this album even one benefit, as they are all narrow minded. Like I said, a band can't showcase their older sound for every single record they record. It gets bothersome to people who are actually willing to see this band grow as musicians and as people. Limp Bizkit has also gotten this kick-in-the-behind by their older fans when their 2003 album Results May Vary was released. Another band that has also gotten this criticism is A Fire Inside (AFI). I read Nate McCooey's review of this album and he mentioned the same band. Seriously, America, when are we going to stop being this stupid? Oh well, it doesn't matter anyway.

B005URRCUY|5.0|Those of you old enough to remember the days when cheap cassette tapes asked your forgiveness for their poor quality will get the joke behind the \\"PLAY LOUD\\" sticker on the Black Keys' new disc.  The rest of you...now you know why \\"El Camino\\" sounds the way it does.  Produced by Danger Mouse, El Camino sounds cheap and you love it for that.  The high ends are a bit too harsh, like Alice in Chains' album \\"Dirt\\", the music isn't antiseptically-clean, and the whole package is a perfect match for the Black Keys' style.  This is alt-rock that borrows from the '60s, '70s, and '80s and is unashamed about it.  It has wailing vocals that seem to land somewhere between Queens of the Stone Age (as on \\"Lonely Boy\\") and the bellow of young Bono (as on \\"Dead and Gone\\").<br /><br />Probably the most addictive tune on this album has to be \\"Gold on the Ceiling\\":  it thumps into your ears with a padded-drum beat and fuzzed-out keyboards that mimic The Doors at their analog best, then gives way to a clap-along beat you can't help but want to move to.  The guitars bang against the high registers like the Beatles' \\"Revolution\\" and from time to time there's a Phil Spector \\"Wall of Sound\\" style echo to the chorus.  \\"Little Black Submarines\\" has a lo-fi Chili Peppers ballad sound to it.  Vocalist Dan Auerbach sounds at times as forlorn as Jack White...which fits because then halfway through it breaks out into a wash of distorted guitar rock and cymbal-heavy percussion.  When you get moments like this, it's as if your ears become convinced that everything you've ever liked about rock was just thrown into a blender and someone set the buttons to \\"Liquefy\\".  There is something for everybody here.  Like The Cult?  \\"Money Maker\\".  Need some heavy folk-rock with just a tinge of stoner?  \\"Run Right Back.\\"<br /><br />In trying to convey El Camino to you, I've just hopped across a basket of bands and quite a few decades.  That doesn't mean this album is a derivative mash-up, though:  think of it more as a genre piece.  Danger Mouse recently did an album (\\"Rome\\") that borrowed a kind of spaghetti-western sound--for The Black Keys, this is the same kind of thing:  a rock album pressed through a retro-filter that's come out the other side a guilty pleasure.Danger Mouse recently did an album (\\"Rome\\") that borrowed a kind of spaghetti-western sound--for The Black Keys, this is the same kind of thing:  a rock album pressed through a retro-filter that's come out the other side a guilty pleasure.

B006P8KKYW|5.0|Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross took an unusual approach to scoring The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo:  they made the score *before* the movie was filmed.  A lot of moviemakers like to keep a stock of what they call 'reference music':  tunes that to them evoke the feel of the movie they're trying to create.  The music stays with them and helps keep them in the appropriate frame of mind.  When Reznor and Ross were asked to help assemble some reference music for The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, the reference music they made ended up being the final product (I'm sure with an adjustment or two).<br /><br />\\"Immigrant Song\\" opens Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross' score to the newer \\"Girl with the Dragon Tattoo film\\" phenomenally:  it is intense, Karen O's caterwaul is chillingly good, and the music seems to comes straight out of the future, despite it being a fairly faithful cover of the decades-old Led Zeppelin song.  I absolutely love this tune, but the rest of the album is completely UN-like Immigrant Song.  Instead we get a simply beautiful series of musical passages.  They are ambient, often dark...and they make great background music for just about anything.<br /><br />If you're familiar with Nine Inch Nails, there was a side EP to \\"The Downward Spiral\\" called \\"Further Down the Spiral\\", which contained alternate versions and other material that didn't end up in \\"The Downward Spiral\\".  \\"Further Down the Spiral\\" showcased Trent Reznor exploring more atmospheric sounds, in some ways similar to the soundtrack for the original Quake game.  Fast forward to recent history and Reznor again broadened his instrumental palette with the haunting and aptly-named \\"Ghosts I-IV\\".  If you are familiar with any of these works, this score really does an amazing job of playing across those sounds.  It is not always as laid-back as \\"Ghosts I-IV\\", but it also never quite sounds as heavy as \\"The Downward Spiral\\"--it's out on the fringe where \\"Further Down the Spiral\\" was forged.  There are fewer strings than \\"Ghosts I-IV\\", with the piano taking the center stage for most of the tracks.<br /><br />What amazes me is how much Reznor and Ross seem to move between 'full' and 'minimal':  \\"Hidden in Snow\\" is barely there, but has this thrum of bass under the surface that slowly builds the tension.  On the other hand, \\"An Itch\\" is bubbling with activity.  Apart from \\"Immigrant Song\\", the only other standout track is the closer \\"Is Your Love Strong Enough\\" (featuring How to Destroy Angels).  Probably the weakest track on the album, it sounds like it went at the end because it got played during the movie's closing credits.<br /><br />If you're already a fan of Nine Inch Nails, you will only regret buying this album if you didn't care for \\"Ghosts I-IV\\".  If you're new to Trent Reznor's musical style and liked the way it sounded in the movie, this music can go with you just about anywhere and still stand on its own.  The score to \\"The Social Network\\" is also like this--if you liked that music, this is even better.  If you enjoy the score to The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, you should look into the Nine Inch Nails album \\"Ghosts I-IV\\" and even consider \\"The Downward Spiral\\" or \\"The Fragile\\".ts I-IV\\", with the piano taking the center stage for most of the tracks.

0099529939|5.0|A nice hardcover book, well bound with an old vintage charm to it. It has all the Sherlock Holmes stories by Arthur Conan Doyle and is nicely indexed. Print is small but clear enough and considering the amount of text, if the print was larger it would make the book unwieldly to handle. As it is, being a hardcover book its not a book you can read with one hand but its not too big  or heavy either. The cover has a cloth feel and dull green colour with gold print and border, adding to the vintage charm. This has no fancy dust cover but came with a slip of black paper around it with print on it saying it is 150th anniversary luxury edition with an introduction by P.D James. Book was delivered intact  and well packaged and arrived in good time.  All in all its a \\"must have\\" for any Sherlock Holmes fan, something you can pass down to your kids and grand kids if looked after well.

1402775458|5.0|Robert Ingpen's illustrations greatly assist young readers in understanding this classic of 19th century literature. There are 70 brilliant watercolor illustrations appropriately scattered throughout the book which greatly assist young readers in following the story line. The book itself is of excellent quality and perhaps the best choice you could make as a gift or keepsake for the $14 price at amazon. The amazon guidance is for readers of 10 and up and i would warn that this age level is largely subjective and depends on the reading level of the child. Perhaps 12 or 13 would be more appropriate for most kids. As parents may recall, the book is filled with nautical terms (its about 18th century pirates after all) with which very young children of today may be unfamiliar. This particular book is a great opportunity though to read it aloud with a 10 year old child and therby being present to answer any questions. Wikipedia's online glossary of nautical terms would also be a helpful reference for a pre-teen reader while reading this book. By all means though i highly recommend this attractive and brilliantly illustrated book as an excellent learning experience for kids.

0061564893|1.0|I was lent the book by a friend - took me about 200 pages (with my eyebrows going up with an 'oh really?' everytime something incredible was stated) before I twigged what was going on.  Menzies seems to be a self-publicist with only him coming up with these viewpoints, ideas, interpretations of the evidence ...  I think he once asked us readers why other writers/scientists hadn't reached the same conclusions.  Obvious answer - they're more thorough (I hesitate to mention scruples).  Menzies jumps to all sorts of conclusions on very little evidence (I delved into \\"Worlds in Collison\\" by Velikovsky once - it's similar), and takes only answers that fit his theories.  This isn't science.  What is annoying is that he seems to have a genuine talent and interest in medieval maps.  Had he written a book on that subject, I'd have stayed the course.  Right now, it's like listening to a lecture about something you're interested in, and finding out half-way through that the lecturer thinks that the instigator were small, irish pixies.  Very amusing perhaps, but not what it said on the door.  Get your hat and head for the exit ...

0307949486|2.0|**Slight spoilers**<br /><br />Like with most popular, well-publicized books, you usually get two parts of the majority: the ones who love the book and proclaim it genius and those who can't stand the sight of it and think it rubbish. I'm of the minority, I suppose. I didn't love or hate it.<br /><br />It's an okay book to waste several days reading. I mean, it certainly interested me enough to where I lost track of time for hours just reading away. The main plot, the Harriet Vanger mystery, while following the usual mystery outline--complete with the typical cast of suspects and even the bad guy revealing at the end their nefarious deeds and the how/why to the protagonist--I actually found it nice enough. I can't say I was surprised with most of the revelations, but I think that part of the book was nicely handled for a typical mystery, overall. I also did like the twist of the hero getting captured and having to be saved by his female partner, who embodied more of what is stereotypically the male hero's characteristics.<br /><br />I know some people saw Larsson as a misogynist because of the atrocities that befall some of the female characters (what? Two?) in this book, but I don't share this opinion. Quite the opposite, actually; both of those characters rise above what happened to them and actually are stronger than the male characters in the book. Simply because someone writes about certain things does not mean they condone it. In fact, I think Larsson felt strongly about abuse of women and wanted to bring it to light. Sure, some parts of this book are manipulative and clearly just there for the shock value (the ludicrous rape of Salander for the second time was done for no other reason in my mind). Yes, the author's ideas and views could have been handled a bit clearly (it seems sloppy at times), but I don't think the book suffers that badly for it. Then again I'm of the mindset that even the silliest plots can be pardoned as long as there are worthwhile characters, but sadly...<br /><br />The characters in and of themselves weren't particularly great. Blomkvist was bland and uninteresting. I wouldn't call him an author insert, directly, but you could easily tell that a lot of what he said and felt in regards to certain topics were all really Larsson; his protagonist was just the mouthpiece. Blomkvist seemed like a nice enough guy, though, but he was just so damned boring. Why did Salander fall in love with him? He was nice and didn't judge her, but that's also a basis for a good, solid friendship. I just couldn't see how she, or anyone for that matter, would fall hard for such an uninteresting, bland man. As for Salander... Something about her smacked of trying too hard to be edgy and original. I think Larsson went a bit overboard. There were times, however, where I did find her pretty damned badass. I just think her character could have been better balanced. The other characters aren't really worth writing about here because they weren't really fleshed out.<br /><br />Anyway, the book was a nice enough read. I may even reread it again in the future. But I doubt I'll buy the two remaining books in the series; I just don't find the characters interesting enough to warrant it. I want a book to stick with me for some time after its end and this book was simply forgotten after I read it.<br /><br />**1/2he characters in and of themselves weren't particularly great. Blomkvist was bland and uninteresting. I wouldn't call him an author insert, directly, but you could easily tell that a lot of what he said and felt in regards to certain topics were all really Larsson; his protagonist was just the mouthpiece.

B005V2EVBQ|4.0|I ordered this about a week ago and it got lost in the mail one email to amazon and they sent a new case free with one day shipping so thanks amazon for clearing that up.  Now for the case I was torn between this or the leather one that's similar and I'm glad with my choice the kindle fits right inside almost like a book cover the design is simple and sleek and very light weight and now my screen is protected when I'm not using it so over all great case highly recommend it.
B004VD3YIM|5.0|Really enjoy using this app. I have two IP cams which I purchased for monitoring my 3 year old and 7 month old sons' bedrooms when they're sleeping, or when we have a babysitter, at which time I move one to the living room. The two way audio feature is great. I didn't know it was built into my cameras until I purchased this app. Motion detection with notification works as it should. App runs perfectly on my Xoom tablet through WiFi, as well as through Verizon 4G LTE on my Samsung Galaxy Nexus. Recommended!
B004UID2LC|5.0|This app is awesome! It saved me $50 worth of songs you would normally buy for .99$ a song. But using this I got the same songs for free! For those of you who are saying, &quot;couldn't get it to work&quot; I think you should put some of that blame on your device, not the app itself.
0718157834|5.0|Well, having never read a Jo Jo Moyes book, I wasn't sure what to expect and what I got was certainly not what I expected. The story is not one I that instantly attracts a reader as it subject matter could be looked upon as depressing. Will Traynor is larger than life until life deals him a bad hand and he is involved in an accident leaving him a quadriplegic. Will has all but given up on life until Lou Clark enters it.<br /><br />Lou Clark is an adorable character from the very beginning. She is a young girl that has lost her job in the small village that she works in and is looking for a new one. When she is offered the job of being a carer, she isn't sure that the job is for her but decides to give it a go anyway. The relationship between Will and Lou had me laughing out loud, and I must say I wasn't expecting the humorous side to the story. However, Jo has managed to deal with the issue of Will's disability with such sensitivity.<br /><br />Lou is determined to make Will see that life is worth living no matter what your situation. This book was one that I couldn't put down. I started it at lunchtime and by the end of the evening it was finished. The book was absolutely gripping. I was really part of Lou's mission and fell in love with all of the characters (including Lou's family). The ending wasn't what I expected and the book had me both laughing and getting teary at the same time.<br /><br />My first Jo Jo Moyes has set the bar and I cannot wait to read another one of her books. I would highly recommend this book but just make sure if you are of a weepy disposition you have the tissues at the ready.
B004T4LUPW|5.0|Make sure you follow the instructions. After initial setup, everything is intuitive.  My favorite part is that it syncs with my husband's iphone Calendergoo. This app has everything I would want a calendar too have.
B0058VW36U|5.0|this game is so addicting. it never freezes and doesn't consume a lot of batteries. this is a must have for all ages. don't just buy it because of what I said. do it for the other millions of fans who want you to indulge in this game
B0000542D2|5.0|One of the great marriages-of-style in movie history, the Beatles' music and Richard Lester's direction are a knockout combination. A Hard Day's Night is purportedly a busy-day-in-the-life of the Fabs as they make their way to London to appear on a TV show, with hilarious consequences.  Screenwriter Alun Owen gives the boys a very good foundation, and the allegedly \\"broad stokes\\" he took to portray them (sarcastic John, charming Paul, sardonic George, put-upon Ringo) IMHO seem unforced and inoffensive.  It's characterization, that's all, and in the early days the Beatles did look very much alike, so the \\"broad strokes\\" aren't so much exaggeration as helpful to the odd viewer who doesn't know the Beatles that well.<br /><br />What really gives the movie its kick is the boys' genuine, broadly-smiling enjoyment at what they're doing (especially during the numbers \\"I'm Happy Just to Dance With You\\" and the reprise of \\"I Should Have Known Better\\", where the usually sullen George for no apparent reason suddenly breaks into a silly little dance while playing his guitar).  Director Lester captures the boys at all the right moments in many exceptionally well-lit and well-set-up shots during the songs.  Basically he sets out to make the Beatles photograph as attractively as possible, and he succeeds.  The Beatles had a remarkably photogenic, bisexual sort of appeal, most notably in their early days, as captured so well here.<br /><br />The later Beatles movies, Help, Magical Mystery Tour, Yellow Submarine, and Let It Be all have moments of brilliance, but Hard Day's Night is by far the strongest, most accessible, most likable and polished of the lot.  Funny, beautifully shot, extremely well-edited, all these years later Hard Day's Night has lost none of its power to set your toes tapping, your body grooving, and just leaving you feeling immensely better in general.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeeeeaaaah!
B0040LK7B2|5.0|So, you can buy a copy of an episode and use it almost everywhere? Really?  I decided to try it out.  It works great and easily on my computer, my two TV's that get Amazon Videos, my wife's laptop, and my Kindle Fire. Basically I ran out of electronics to try it on.  The video and sound are really great and live up to the HD claim. Not yet at blu-ray standard, but close.  It downloaded to my Fire quickly and smoothly (It's a video of an episode, not a whole movie, but a whole movie wouldn't take long either). Now, when I am offline, I can watch the episode.  Oh, the episode? Good, of course: All about the downsides of getting what you want.
0439023521|5.0|The book arrived promptly and was in tip top condition!  Also...I highly recommend this book...it was SO GOOD!  A Great read :)
B003L77GGU|5.0|Sorry, I couldn't resist the title.  If you like \\"Supernatural,\\" you will really like having Season 6 blu-ray. No commercials, but all the story.  If you enjoy finding out about BTS, the various extras help out.  For fans, a great gift or hint gift (Hey, you know how my birthday is coming up...Nah, there is nothing I want in particular...Although, you know how much I enjoy... especially Season 6... ).
B00479SVBU|5.0|Wanted to wait to give a review. I LOVE it!!  I just sat in my truck for about an hour, and went thru the info sheet it came with and you can do almost anything with it.  As far as not sounding like a CD...the SoundFly has it's own set of Bass/Treble/Volume, etc., just adjust that along with your stereo and it gets pretty close to a CD.  I have a '03 Pathy, with the Bose 6 CD upgrade. Like many Bose systems on those models, the CD kinda starts and stops during play...works great when not moving...LOL  Replaced a few times...system supposedly too sensitive for the truck. I really only used CD's...but that stop/start crap just pushed me over the edge..LOL  I used a USB for my music, tried my Sansa, sounded like garbage...sounds GREAT when use by itself with the ear buds, just not for this.  I say, just take the time to adjust all the sound stuff...it DOES sound great, for me, that is.  Also live in a relatively small town area, so no trouble with channels on radio coming in or out.  ONLY bizarre thing...if you take the USB stick out, and want to adjust things on it...the printing on the display is \\"inside out\\"...like you're reading from \\"behind\\" it.  So, you gotta re-start it and it goes back to normal.  I also like the fact that the \\"banner\\" on my stereo recognizes the artist and song ang keeps streaming it across it...just like it does for radio stations broadcasting with satellite.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Just because there are over100 games, they are all fun and different. I was sceptical at first, but then saw my 3 year old having fun with the games and started playing. its a wonderful app.
0061122416|2.0|What brought me to The Alchemist was the continual badgering I got from friends telling me that this was an amazing book that would be perfect for me.  I finally caved.  I found it and read it.  What I got out of The Alchemist was a badgering lecture on metaphysics.  Don't get me wrong, I can see where Coelho is coming from in wanting to write a spiritual guidebook for people without direction to find their way in the world, to follow their dreams and if they follow them deep enough that their dreams will come true.  All-in-all The Alchemist is a very longwinded Biblical-esque Ali Baba fable which seems to exist in a place out of time.  Aesop could have done it more justice in three paragraphs.  In fact, The Alchemist would be better, as short as it is, if it were made even shorter, cutting down on the poorly drawn characters who stood to represent types rather than individuals.  Coming from someone who has pondered what he wants out of life and who he wants to be when he grows up I suppose this book might help a fifth grader to follow his superstitious notions into whatever dark recesses of the cosmos he should fall into.  But based in reality, this book and it's story is not based in reality.  People whether we like it or not, change.  The characters in this are, all of them, too stubborn to do anything but the one thing they are used to.    The writing is nothing to shout about.  If I never have to hear Soul of the World or Personal Legend ever again I will be just fine.  Perhaps the translator is to blame.  The one thing I wished he'd come clean and just shouted out was the Franco-American motto: Pursuit of Happiness.  What upsets me is that people, after they have read this, consider themselves to be well read.  Instead of putting in hours with Dostoevsky, who would offer a much more compelling tale of morality.  At least the reader would gain some actual perspective about what the character is truly thinking, instead of being paranoid to death of omens.  The Alchemist proves to really be an oasis for lost souls.  But if you have read this and you are ready to move on, try something like Cat's Cradle by Vonnegut, to give you a much more entertaining and enlightening view of hokey religious gobledy gook that The Alchemist takes far too seriously.  Where Coelho succeeds is in leaving a stench of self-assumed self-serving self-importance of his self-proclaimed philosophy which, I'm pretty sure, Pinocchio and Walt Disney and a billion other people throughout history has already stated and stated it in a more enjoyable way.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I absolutely love this app. It's one of the best Bible apps out there and it's totaly free, could ask for better:)
B00479SVBU|5.0|Seeing as I've only had this item for a few weeks and only used it a few times so far, I am very happy with this little gizmo.  For over a year, I held off buying an FM converter because I heard so many not so good things about them.  When I learned about this SoundFly and read all the great reviews, I felt confident about the reliability this item offers and bought it.  I am very happy with the design and the quality of performance.  Right out of the box it works great.  It locks onto 88.3 in my area and delivers great sound.  And the device sits up nicely and smartly in the cig lighter and looks like it is part of the driver's console like it belongs there.  I really like being able to plug a usb stick into it to play music.  I also use it with my Sansa Fuze and it works great with it too.  I have not figured out how to use the remote yet except for using it for volume control.  It is well worth the $45 or so.
0446556750|3.0|I have read Michael Connolly mysteries for many years. This one not much of a mystery. The story is slow. One knows who did it and then it ends.
B00008PX8P|5.0|I bought this for my boyfriend, he loves Led Zeppelin. It's a great product, lots of extra features. He loves it.
B004EPYZUI|5.0|I have no idea what the \\"critics\\" are talkin' about. This movie is cool, fun, and original....... wait that must be it. Critics aren't used to original scripts coming outta Hollywood. If it's not a remake or some drama laden bore it doesn't get their happy juices going.  The cool thing about this flick is that it hits several genres all at once. It's a period piece set in the 50s. Dark and with like a steam punk feel. Then you get the first fight scene - think Anime meets Crouching Tiger. um, with a hot blonde rockin' some fab moves.  Then you get a world war I scene, and then a fantasy/castle scene complete with a dragon as the main character, Babydoll, and her sidekicks go on four wild adventures to acquire items needed to escape the hell that they're in.  It's worth a watch, a purchase and a couple of thumbs up. I own it on Blu-ray and gave it as gifts to all my friends whom i knew were getting blu-ray players this past Christmas. Again, fun, different and sexy. Worth every penny. Why are you still reading and not checking out?!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is fun if u just want to waste time. ive already played 20mins and I just got it. its very addicting once you unlock some interesting games.
0143118706|5.0|I loved this book so much that I have read it 3 times and have since given it to my sister and my friends. I love Liz Gilbert's writing style, honesty, humor and candor. Marriage is a very touchy subject for a lot of people and I find her brave for taking it on from her own point of view and tackling her own concerns and fears about marriage.  She voices many points that I have grappled with and thought about myself. The conversations that she's had with her friends and loved ones are very similar to the ones that I have had with mine.<br /><br />I find the negative reviews that I have seen here very harsh and unwarranted. Liz's way of going about making peace with something that she was unsuccessful at in the past and analyzing why it wasn't in order to ensure a different outcome the 2nd time around makes sense. It's more than what most people do when they are contemplating marriage at all. They just jump in w/out thinking or having any kind of critical conversations with their soon to be spouse.<br /><br />I found the research that she did on marriage eye opening and compelling. This book has made for some great conversations with my husband and in my circle of friends and family.  In the end, I think the main point is about opening up the conversation about what you think the definition of marriage is.  Asking yourself what are your expectations, what role do you see yourself as well as your partner playing in it? These are things that need to be discussed way before the proposal comes along. It is sad that for most people, these things don't get talked about until there is already a problem in the marriage.<br /><br />Even if you don't agree with her take on it, the important thing is that it gets you thinking and talking about what you do believe, which is important for you to know first and foremost before you bring somebody else into your life and ask them to share it with you.
B0068MNO4S|5.0|I see no reason to believe the premise at all, which handicapped this film from the beginning. And yet, in spite of the handicap, it was a great piece of drama with excellent acting, sets and costumes. Put \\"what if\\" in front of the premise and a question mark after it and just enjoy the movie in that context. As easy as \\"what if Ewoks exist?\\"
B004MC8CA2|5.0|i love this app it has all versions on it and the Bible in one year and chronological bibles are very helpful.
B000KFB4PK|5.0|Christmas gifts for girls, 13yr old and 16yr old.  The girls love them and the watches are working fine.  The bands colors on the watch can be switched around, to match clothing.  These watches are definately worn pretty often.  I would highly suggest. You never know what kids will like.
