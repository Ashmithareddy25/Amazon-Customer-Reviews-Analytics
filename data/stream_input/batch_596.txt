B000E97Y6K|5.0|Viewed on the small screen, last year's King Kong is a bit more of a problematic experience than it was on the big screen, being at once a mixture of the best and worst of Peter Jackson. His love of and sheer joy in film-making is manifestly obvious right from the delirious opening montage of Depression era New York that gives the background detail a modern audience wouldn't bring into the theatre with them as they did in 1933 with a wonderful visual economy so much of the rest of the film lacks. Unfortunately he then spends a couple of reels detailing the death of Vaudeville and Carl Denham's problems with studio execs. And then a couple of reels on getting under way. And then far too many reels sailing to Skull Island - when Denham promised Ann a long ocean voyage, he wasn't kidding. It's not so much that they're bad scenes (though some are quite weak), more that there's no reason for all of them to be there. Most could have easily been thrown over the side with the rest of the ship's fittings, but instead they tend to bury the more portentous moments under trivia. Indeed, it's interesting to note that a draft of Jackson's aborted attempt to film it in 1998 included none of this section whatever, kicking off with the Venture piercing the fog in search of Skull Island.<br /><br />But once it literally crashes into Skull Island, the film really takes off - the natives this time really are savage, almost Neolithic, the action scenes well-handled and the pace relentless. Jackson even manages to top several sequences from the original - the Bride of Kong sacrifice, Kong escaping from the Broadway theatre, the Empire State Building finale, here a breathtakingly dizzying piece of filmmaking - as well as throwing in some good additions of his own, such as a truly charming scene on the ice in Central Park or a couple of convincing storm sequences on the perilous shores of Skull Island. There are plenty of fun injokes that don't seem awkwardly forced on the picture either -Denham tries to get Fay Wray for the lead in his picture, but she's making a film for Merian C. Cooper at RKO; the scene they shoot on the boat is one from the 1933 film; Rick Baker, the man inside the suit in 1976, is one of the pilots gunning down Kong; and the interpolation of much of Max Steiner's score offers some nice musical nods even if the \\"Walla Walla Kong Kong!\\" lyrics are omitted.<br /><br />There's more that's good than bad about the film by a long way, but the bad is bad enough to keep this from becoming an all-time classic in its own right<br /><br />There's some striking miscasting. Much as he looks like Orson Welles in certain shots, Jack Black really isn't up to Carl Denham, a part Oliver Platt or Vincent D'Onfrio could have dome in their sleep: too often he looks like he's telling a joke that's fallen flat rather than delivering dramatic dialog, and there's that air of trying too hard that follows him around like a bad smell. Naomi Watts is surprisingly anodyne and not terribly flatteringly photographed (to put it mildly), reminding me why, despite some good work in the past, she remains so resolutely unmemorable an actress. Kyle Chandler hams it up fairly charmlessly as her nominal leading man, telegraphing the jokes to such a degree that they're more irritating distractions than genuine comic relief. Adrien Brody's unlikely hero fares better despite having nothing much to do in the last act, while the smaller roles fare better, with Thomas Kretschmann's Engelhorn, Evan Parke's Hayes and Jamie Bell's cabin boy all making their mark before being unceremoniously discarded.<br /><br />But the acting honors easily belong to Andy Serkis' Kong, a triumph not just of CGI (and far more convincing than he appeared in the trailers) but also performance. It's not merely that this Kong is more facially expressive - he's caught the body language perfectly, convincing us that it's a great ape rather than a human being dictating the moves. It makes the same mistake as the 1976 version in having Ann feel empathy with Kong which, while better executed here, lessens the tragedy of Kong - the fact his devotion was unrequited was one of the things that made his last stand so much more touching and pitiful.<br /><br />Elsewhere, the effects are variable and too often Jackson throws in an FX shot just because he likes the idea - not so much a problem with the beasties but definitely tiresome when we get to yet another CGI shot of the ship at sea. Nor are all of the effects quite state of the art. The problem is the old one with CGI - poor integration of the live action and computer generated footage, both of which all too often seem to be shot at visibly different resolutions (particularly noticeable in the stampede sequence). Yet compared to the two previous remakes, Jackson's genuine love of the material still carries the day and certainly delivers the best of 2005's blockbusters.
B00008DDXL|5.0|The big-screen adaptation of JK Rowlings' second Harry Potter book, the Chamber of Secrets, is once again directed by Chris Columbus, and is an improvement over his first enjoyable offering. It begins once more with Harry literally a prisoner of the Dursley's (again played brilliantly by Richard Griffiths & Fiona Shaw), who before being rescued by Ron and the Weasley twins in a flying Ford Anglia, receives a warning from a self-harming house-elf called Dobby, that Harry's life is in great danger and that he's not to return to Hogwarts. Undeterred, Harry returns to Hogwarts with the help of Ron and the flying car, despite Dobby's best efforts to stop them. <br /> <br />Whilst the opening stay at the Weasly's home is mostly light-hearted, the movie soon turns decidedly darker at Hogwarts when students begin to get petrified and a sinister message is daubed on the wall in blood that the Chamber of Secrets has been opened and that Mudblood deaths will follow. Students suspect Harry, especially when they discover that he has the rare talent of parselmouth, the ability to communicate with snakes. And so Harry, Ron and Hermione begin their second adventure at Hogwarts in trying to solve the mystery of the Chamber of Secrets and ensuring that Hogwarts isn't closed by the nervous school governors. <br /> <br />The acting of young Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson as Harry, Ron and Hermione is greatly improved over their performances in the first movie, although it is still a little suspect in places, especially the irksome face Ron pulls every time there is any danger. However, the great adult ensemble cast is once again excellent, this time lead by a superb performance from Kenneth Branagh as the pompous, egotistical and inept new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, Professor Gilderoy Lockhart. Branagh is obviously enjoying himself camping-it-up and poking fun at his own celebrity, and steals practically every scene that he is in. <br /> <br />The special effects are a mixed bag; Dobby the house-elf just doesn't cut it, especially when compared the amazing CGI creation of Gollum in the Lord of the Rings trilogy, whilst Aragog and the giant spiders in the Forbidden Forest are brilliantly realised and would scare any arachniaphobe half to death! <br /> <br />The DVD also includes the usual extras, including 19 deleted scenes, a tour of Hogwarts, interviews with the cast, and most enjoyably, an interview with JK Rowling. <br /> <br />All in all, the Chamber of Secrets is another enjoyable Harry Potter movie, plus it's always a pleasure to see JK Rowlings magical universe brought to life on the screen - a fast-paced, dark, imaginative and enjoyable movie for children of all ages.
B00003CXB4|5.0|This is by far one of the best movies of all time! Disney produced a really funny and heartfelt movie. The movie is about a young lion prince who grows up to be the king. But it isn't that easy, he must go through many obstacles on his way there including his awful uncle Scar(Jeremy Irons) Nathan Lane throws in some laughs as well as Ernie Sabella. This is an impressive cast, and the movie is directed to perfection. Lion King can be watched and enjoyed in any age group. I highly recommend this wonderful movie.
B00003CXI1|5.0|It is really quite amazing that a major motion picture not only remained very faithful indeed to Rowling's original novel but actually succeeded very well in recreating the magical scenery and extraordinary environment of Hogwart's. The special effects in the movie are, on the whole, fantastic, a fact which becomes obvious upon Harry's first entrance into the Great Hall. Most amazing of all may be the spectacular presentation of the game of Quidditch. While almost all of Rowling's descriptions in the novel come leaping off the page, it is a little difficult to get a real picture of Quidditch in one's head; thanks to the movie, my days of struggling to really visualize the game as it is played are a thing of the past. There are a couple of occasions upon which the special effects look just a tad hokey, but the overall effect of the film is so magical that I'm not complaining. Indeed, I find it quite refreshing indeed to see a film follow the author's original words and scenes so faithfully; there were minor adjustments to the story along the way, and in a couple of cases the changes actually proved more effective than the original scene would have played on the big screen. The cast is excellent up and down the line. Daniel Radcliffe is Harry Potter as far as I'm concerned, but I was even more impressed by Rupert Grint as Ronald Weasley and Emma Watson (my favorite) as the incomparable Hermione Granger. Richard Harris' brilliant performance as Albus Dumbledore will be sorely missed in future films. I would be remiss to forget Robbie Coltrane's critical contribution as the one and only Hagrid, but by far the most effective job is done by Alan Rickman, whose performance as Professor Snape ranks among the most impressive acting jobs I've ever seen. <br />Everybody knows the plot of the movie by now. The only weakness in this epic production comes in the form of snippets and scenes from Rowling's novel that were not included - this is understandable, as the movie runs a good two and a half hours as it is. The ending seems to come up just a little short, yet it is quite enjoyable as it is. A few plot points that reveal more about some of the key characters can only be found in the book, but the fact that they are most important in terms of what they betoken for future novels and movies makes them a little less than crucial for this first Harry Potter motion picture. Overall, as a full-grown adult clinging to what few fancies of youth he has left, I have to say I loved every minute of this movie. Its commitment to Rowling's vision is to be commended, and there can be no doubt that there are bigger and better adventures yet to come in both book and movie form.  <br /> <br />The DVD features are, at least to a certain point, rather fun to mess around with, but they probably appeal more to young people than adults. I for one began to grow a little bored after touring Hogwart's, but the fact is that anything on top of the movie itself is just a bonus. I've watched Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone several times now, and I have enjoyed it greatly each and every time.
B00005JO20|4.0|This movie had incredible special effects. Before I watched this movie, I had heard it was long and boring; but it was the exact opposite of that. The movie was an action packed film, and there were barely any slow parts in it. The story is about a director who is trying to make it big. Only he is very slimy and commits many lies through the making of the film. The crew manages to make it to an island that contains a huge monkey(King Kong). Everyone is scared but excited at the same time. The ending is incredibly sad but the journey through the movie is worth it. Jack Black brings humor into the film. But the five star part of the movie is the special effects, and how realistic the different creatures look.
B000BW7QWW|3.0|I had some minor interest in seeing this movie, but a friend of mine insisted that I borrow his dvd, so I went ahead and saw it.<br /><br />Wow!  What an original story, great relatively unknown cast, good effects, and engaging dialogue.<br /><br />For the price, it's a great movie to add to your collection.  Great as a group movie or to watch by yourself late at night.
B000059Z8J|5.0|It was painful watching Christopher Reeve in the DVD extra section doing his interview after his riding accident and before he died.I would like to say the studio made the right choice in picking him to play The Man of Steel.The other part of the DVD extras was how the movie was made and the problems which occured.The part about the special effects and building the sets blew me away.Bringing in Mario Puzo to do the writing was a good idea.But John Williams,what can I say about his works.The opening theme music is a classic.If Mozart and the other music geniuses were alive today they won't be able to compete against John Williams who should be named the greatest music composer ever.To me the movie with the DVD extras should be in everyone's movie library.
0380973464|5.0|Cryptonomicon turned me on to Neil Stephenson, one of our finest this-age fiction writers.  Cryptonomicon tells two deeply intertwined stories, one of the people and actions of WW II's secret code breaking and code making world, with all the wild human and military activity needed to create, protect and take advantage of such intelligence.  The other story takes place today and takes us through the creation, launch and international response to a new huge global electronic business, featuring not surprisingly, cryptography.   <br /> <br />The characters are appealing, vibrant and reappear in multigenerational families and old acquaintances.  This novel is a can't-put-it-down rip snorter of a tale from two different times, woven wonderfully together, and satisfying as hell.   <br /> <br />I simply could not put it down and have given away half a dozen copies to friends.  I just finished Stephenson's Baroque Cycle:  Quicksilver, The Con-fusion, and The System of the World.  Deeper and three times as long, the Cycle stands alone.  Read Cryptonomicon first to get Stephenson's style.  If you like him, wade into the Cycle.  You will not be disappointed.   <br />
B00003CY6M|4.0|Good old John Cusack.  Nobody plays the average, nice, sensitive boyfriend like him.  And he's right at home in this whimsical, if somewhat silly, romantic movie.  Cusack plays a documentary producer who has a chance encounter with the lovely Sarah (Kate Beckinsale).  Sara is a strong believer in fate and while they have a charming evening together, she wants to make sure they're not supposed to be together, so she hatches a plot that backfires and so our starcrossed couple go on their merry way.  About seven years later, Sarah and Jonathan are involved in new romances, but somehow they still wonder about what might have been.  I'm used to seeing Beckinsale fighting vampires and lycans in the UNDERWORLD franchise, so it's nice to see this beauty in a different kind of role and although she and Cusack don't have a lot of time together, they have a charming chemistry.  John Corbett and Bridget Moynahan are the new lovers and they're likeable, just not meant to be, huh?  Jeremy Piven (ENTOURAGE) is fine as Cusack's seemingly happily married best buddy and Molly Shannon is good as Kate's bosom buddy.  It's all hopelessly romantic but so well done, you'll enjoy it if you like this kind of film.
0671015206|4.0|To be wealthy, one needs to live below one's means, saving the remainder.  If you do this long enough (i.e. if you start early), you too can be a millionaire. <br /> <br />The authors in their research profile millionaires.  I suspect that they dreamed of selling this research to those companies that market the affluent.  My speculation is that the authors were likely unhappy with their conclusions.  Average millionaires got to be millionaires by not buying the products marketed to the affluent (cars, mansions, yatchs, etc). <br /> <br />Given the marketing research direction, this book is not a self-help book on how you too can be a millionaire.  But the book does give helpful insights into how millionaires got to be millionaires.  It is up to the reader to figure out how to live well below your means and how to invest their savings. <br /> <br />The book could be shorter. The statistics in the book could put some people off if they are mathematically challenged.  The basic premise of the book can be understood without the statistics.  My advice is to read the beginning chapters, skimming the statistics if need be.
B0000C6DWU|5.0|This movie is hilarious. It's as good as Shrek and much better then Shark Tale. Nemo decides to swim out to sea, but he gets lost. His father must go find him, so he travels the ocean looking everywhere. On his way the father meets Dory(Ellen Degeneres) who must have a form of alzheimers. Him and Dory go on a deep and far adventure searching for the long and lost Nemo. This is one of the best cartoon movies I have ever seen, I hope to see a sequel.
0767817478|5.0|I was 11 years old when I saw the very first Godzilla movie.  My mother knew I was in trouble when I watched as he was disintegrated in the sea. I cried my eyes out. From that time on, that was it for me. I was in love with the guy in the rubber suit. It was a love affair that has lasted all these years. My mother, understanding my obsession, even bought me a Godzilla action figure for my 35th birthday. Over the years, I've accumulated quite a collection of Godzilla movies. I rented this modernized version and really enjoyed it. BUT DEFINITELY NOT GODZILLA! The only thing remotely resembling the original creature is the roar he makes and even then, they've added a \\"screech\\" during his roar..and he's big, and knocks down buildings. What's missing besides the rippley, zippered suit is the comical way the mouth movements are not in sync with the sound in the original films, and the \\"fire\\" Godzilla sprays from his mouth. I enjoyed it enough to buy the dvd but I don't look at it as \\"Godzilla\\". I prefer to call it \\"the other lizard\\". The cast was very good and the storyline was different. Hank Azaria was especially good. The scene where the eggs break open and all hell breaks loose is a nail biter. Actually, there were a few nail biter moments. I feel this movie is a must see for monster movie fans in spite of the title. They could decide to make a modernized sequel eventually, but the fans know who the real \\"king of the monsters\\" is. So, should you rent or buy this film, just try to get past it and visualize the title as \\"The Other Lizard\\".
B000001C6M|5.0|Slayer's \\"Show No Mercy\\" is one of the greatest thrash metal albums ever! This has got all that thrash is - brutal, violent, headbanging, thrashy, fast, and wild as hell. Songs like \\"The Antichrist\\" just wanna make me stand up and say \\"HAIL SLAYER!!\\"
B00005JNRY|4.0|I was fourtante enough to see an advance screening of this movie and got a gift after so thank you Disney. Now when I heard that a movie about CARS was being made I wondered how can you make a movie out of that? Well, based on Pixar's history, I knew that it would be entertaining and I was right.<br /><br />  The movie is a fun and enjoyable film. The CGI is very well done considering that it's hard to design Cars as they have no personality or anything like that. The voices are well cast especially Paul Newman who, in real life, is really a race car driver. Typecasting? Perhaps but he's perfect for his role as a \\"washed up\\" race car. Of course you also have Pixar stable John Ratzenberger as a truck. Used to be John Goodman. Larry the Cable Guy is hilarious as a redneck rusted tow truck. Owen Wilson as the main character of Lightning McQueen. An egotistical selfish person but lovable nontheless.<br /><br />  The moral of the story is basically: Winning isn't everything. There are more important things then winning. And I belive, this being a family film, brings this message across throughout the movie. It's a movie that has heart, laughter, charm,and personality. With CARS I can truly say that we have the first hit of the summer. Not only that, Pixar has another hit. Congratulations.<br /><br />  Stay through the end credits for a surprise.
B00080Z53O|2.0|This film seems to want to have it both ways - offering the premise that not all disability is disposable - just Sampedro's.    An incredible amount of talent and creativity went into a film that pays homage to ... well, plainly put - a man that was too petulant to live. The movie presents Ramon Sampedro - a talented, intelligent and articulate  man as someone who ultimately proves to be a self-pitying whiner.     It was not that he was not capable of living a life of accomplishment and satisfaction - he simply refused to. Despite the acclaim and admiration that his writing had brought to him, despite the devotion of those around him that loved and cared for him, Sampedro seems a bit like the child who gathers his marbles up from the playground and marches home because someone hadn't played by his rules. (Refusing a wheelchair? C'mon!)    Granted, the stress, humiliation and despair of being a quadriplegic cannot be minimalized nor discounted. However, giving up on what you may have once hoped your life would be for what it ultimately becomes proves to be difficult for all of us - no matter what the size or nature of our own personal challenges.    (Oddly enough the very limitations that he views as untenable are most likely the factors that pushed him to reach inside himself and find a voice that brought him such attention and celebrity. Imagine the platform that was his ... and was thrown away)     Yes, yes - allow the man to end his life if he is incapable of recognizing the gift that he squandered; let us be done with him if he so chooses. We should not, however, celebrate his cowardice - the easy out - this foolish waste of something precious. What an insult this film seems to those who struggle quietly everyday with half the talents, abilities or the emotional resources of devoted family and friends that were at Sampedro's disposal. Those gifts for which others could only envy, Sampedro discarded in self-indulgent and careless abandon. The joys that others could only dream about, he chose to reject.    It would be better instead for us to triumph with Stephen Hawking (\\"Brief History of Time\\"), Christy Brown (\\"My Left Foot\\") or Helen Keller (\\"The Miracle Worker\\") - each of whom had to face the equal of the challenges that Sampedro faced, but did not cower in resignation or mawkish self-absorption. Instead they rose above the limitations (those imposed on them either by themselves or those around them) and made all our lives better for their struggle.
B0000009SE|5.0|Frnak Zappa-Waka/Jawaka *****<br /><br />I just want to start off by saying I love Frank Zappa. The man was a genius, there was no style of music the man didnt make at one time or another and he did them all brilliantly. While he has ventured into all teritorys of music he still can't be placed into a genra of his own. The ever changing chamillion of music finds himself here making a Big band and swing album, but not just any bug band and swing album, \\"THE\\" big band and swing album.<br /><br />For Waka/Jawaka brought in a phenomonal horn players, well what else would you expect you have to be the best ot play with Frank Zappa. And while I love this album I was shocked to find then many others did as well. Big band isnt really something people listen to anymore, I know I dont but for some reason I feel that this is a fantastic album, infact it is one of my all tiem favorites from the man himself. But I didnt think many otehrs would share my passion for this album, but then I saw that it has a four and a half star rating and so it should, it's a masterpiece.<br /><br />'Your Mouth' and 'It Just Might Be A One Shot Deal' are the only two songs on the record with lyrics and they are great songs. 'It Just Might Be A One Shot Deal' is amazing, the trumpet is out of this world. 'Your Mouth' has some humorous lyrics and is actually a really good song when you jsut listen to the music and the lyrics are good when you want a good laugh.<br /><br />The two instrumentals 'Big Swift' and the awesome title track 'Waka/Jawaka' are both great. The album starts out on top with 'Big Swifty' which is one of the very bets songs that Frank Zappa ever wrote and recorded. It is easily one of my all time favorites. Much like the albums starts out on top it really goes out with a bang. The amazing title track 'Waka/Jawaka' is classic. One of the best compositions ever recorded in the history of music.<br /><br />So while I am usualy and fan of guitar driven music and since that is the soul reason why I got into Frank Zappa in the first place I never thought I would like this album. I eventualy gave it a try and fell in love with it at my very first listen. This is a fantastic album with superb musicianship. You will never find this album in a record store, trust me I searched and searched, it's not there. You can only order it off the internet, so please, please do you wount be sorry, this is an amazing record that needs to be heard by all. For anyone who was willing to even look at this album and read this review then by the album I recomend it to you and you wount be dissapointed.the soul reason why I got into Frank Zappa in the first place I never thought I would like this album.

B00062ZE3U|4.0|Another girlie fronted goth metal band? Yep. Any Good? You bet.<br /><br />Can you get excited about more of this stuff? Well you should. the breakthrough album by these Dutch metallers (and just how many have there been from those parts) and the whole package falls together.<br /><br />Right from the cover, which doesn't go for the overt cartoon style of so much Euro product to the thought put into the packaging and set listing, this album was viewed by fans and the band as their serious attack on not only the charts but also the metal conscience. Beautiful, orchestral and brooding this is a band with bundles of talent playing with restraint when they could so easily go right off the deep end. Even the video for the single Stand My Ground - the whole thing was a serious attack on the charts, at least in Europe.<br /><br />Throughout the disc the band addresses different aspects, at time uplifting in the aforementioned Stand My Ground and at other times downright bleeding from the heart with tunes like Memories.<br /><br />Overall a mighty release with awesome use of orchestras, layered chorus', modern production values etc all blended to create a quality release that has joined Nightwishs' Once as the must have female fronted metal release. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is that it does lack a little immediacy and overall there is an overwrought feel to some of the tunes, where you just want them to really cut loose and unleash some serious headbanging action.<br /><br />The version I got had a second (DVD) disc which really adds to the value so track it down if you can as the live footage etc really shows more of the band than just listening to this disc can do for you.
B0008KLVG4|5.0|- - BECAUSE WE ARE ALL AT RISK OF BEING EATEN ANYTIME WE ARE NEAR SALT WATER!      <br /> <br />IT BEGINS WHEN -----  <br /> <br />It begins when a \\"summer girl\\" goes for a midnight swim and, after being reported missing, is later discovered on the beach --in pieces. Is it a shark attack, a boating accident, or what? After all, all we saw were a few tugs and screams. But was there something hidden in the water? Or was it as the mayor suggested, a simple drowning followed by a collsion with a boat's propeller for the \\"summer girl\\"?  <br /> <br />BUT THEN ---  <br /> <br />After a short and sweet coverup by the business-oriented mayor and town council, more swimmers and fisherman get mangled at sea and there are witnesses to some of these slayings, ending the chance of both a continued coverup and a lucrative summer business for Amity Island [flimed at Martha's Vineyard].  <br /> <br />During the Amity versus Jaws segment, we see more and more of the shark and more graphic depictions of the shark and its dining habits.  <br /> <br />AH --- BUT THIS IS ONLY THE BEGINNING ---  <br /> <br />Then, the second and primary theme develops. Roy Scheider as Chief Martin Brody, Richard Dreyfuss as Matt Hooper, a scientist from the \\"Oceanographic Institute\\", and Robert Shaw as Captain Quint, an off-the-wall sailor set sail to kill the \\"Great White\\" that is turning the water red around the seaside community of Amity Island.  <br /> <br />YOU AND I ARE AT RISK OF BEING EATEN ANYTIME WE ARE NEAR SALT WATER!  <br /> <br />This part of the movie is a combination wild buddy adventure and monster movie. However, the basic theme that has induced fear into audiences and all swimmers afterward is pervasive now aboard ship, during the hunt for Jaws. You see, no one sees Jaws until it is too late, if at all. The crew of three now simply wait for something to come up, out of the dark waters below, and literally crash onto their small fishing boat. Therein lies the charm of Jaws -- it can comeout without warning and simply tear you or your loved ones to shreds. Even on a boat, a dock, or within shallow, patrolled beaches, we are all at risk of becoming a meal for a monster. When the film is over the risk still remains. If and when we return to the beach at the ocean, we will find ourselves suddenly reminded that we are not at the top of the food chain. This is what makes propaganda so effective, and here it is at its best -- YOU AND I ARE AT RISK OF BEING EATEN ANYTIME WE ARE NEAR SALT WATER! Wherever did we get that idea from?  <br /> <br />IN THE END: [plot spoilers below]  <br /> <br />Spielberg gives us a very satisfying end which does differ somewhat from the book. Quint goes the way of Captain Ahab, right into the beast's mouth, still kicking, stabbing, shouting and fighting. Next, as the ship is sinking, Chief Brody, after repeated shots with a rifle does get the oxygen tank to explode in Jaws' mouth for a dramatic end to this bad fish. Afterward, Hooper makes a surprise return from what we assumed was a sure death within a mangled anti-shark cage. The film closes with the two buddies paddling toward the distant shore using two of the floating shark barrels to float on as they kick their way away from the camera and toward home.  <br /> <br />BUT ITS NEVER REALLY OVER BECAUSE WE ALL KNOW THAT JAWS IS STILL OUT THERE!  <br /> <br />ABOUT THE DVD: [TOP PICK: 30TH ANNIVERSARY WIDESCREEN]  <br /> <br />There are at least 5 releases on DVD that I know of. In all cases, the film appears about the same, the differences being in the features and whether it is a Widescreen or Full-Frame Format. The last release is the 30th Anniversary Edition which differs from the Anniversary Edition [25th Anniversary in small print] only in the featurettes. One is longer and is touted as being new and improved over the last release. Both Anniversary releases have some deleted scenes. Again, the biggest extra feature on the 30th Anniversary edition is \\"From The Set: An insider's look at life on the set of Jaws\\" which features a \\"never-before-available interview with Steven Spielberg\\". Okay, that is about the biggest difference, but though I have seen both Anniversary editions, I am staying with the \\"Anniversary Edition\\" in Widescreen from 2000.

0345440900|1.0|I have a B.S. in Human Development and a 10 week old baby and I wanted to throw this book in the trash.  I read this book because my sister-in-law views it as scripture.  I could hardly get through the first chapter without being furious that Tracy Hogg is making money selling this book.  Hogg's advice and opinions (particularly on breastfeeding)are not realistic for parents and babies.  She condemns feeding on demand, which is the obvious way to breastfeed.  Your baby tells you when he is hungry, you don't tell him.  If you don't feed babies on demand your milk supply will not be ready for growth spurts not to mention the fact that you will miss out on the ultimate way to bond and comfort your baby. <br />From the day my baby was born I have nursed him when he wants to be nursed, put him to sleep when he is tired, and played with him when he was alert and playful.  He goes to bed about the same time every night and sleeps for 7 1/2 hours before he wakes up to be nursed and he is a very content baby.  I would imagine that this book works best for people who don't have the first idea of  how to take care of an infant but I would suggest they read ANYTHING else about infant care, find a real lactation consultant and talk to their pediatrician for advice.
0156030306|4.0|\\"Flowers for Algernon\\" was a classic short story about a retarded man named Charlie Gordon, who undergoes experimental brain surgery to increase his IQ.  At first, the operation lifts Charlie to the level of a genius:  he masters math and foreign languages, does scientific research, and falls in love.  But the surgery eventually unravels and Charlie reverts to retardation, only now fully aware of what this fate means.  Written in the first-person as Charlie's journal, the story was sensitive, thoughtful, and heartbreaking.  It won numerous science fiction awards.      Unfortunately, the novel-length version feels padded.  Written during the heydey of psychoanalysis in the 1960s, much space is given to Charlie's inner sexual conflicts as he relates to women for the first time in his life.  These parts either seem mechanical, like something lifted from a psychology text, or smack of high school creative writing.  One portentous sex scene near the end of the book is either very embarassing or very authentic, depending on how you read it:  written in Charlie's voice, it certainly reads like the author had never had sex.      Fortunately, other parts of \\"Flowers for Algernon\\" are very powerful, as when Charlie is flooded with memories of childhood family conflicts.  With his new insight, he can see that his abusive mother had pushed him to be \\"normal,\\" and then abandoned him in an institution when she saw this wasn't possible.  Still yearning for her approval, Charlie seeks her out to show her that he has finally been \\"cured\\" of retardation.  It's too late:  she is senile and barely able to recognize him.   This failed reunion is the book's saddest moment, and an unforgettable comment on human estrangement and lost opportunities to connect.  Whatever its faults, \\"Flowers for Algernon\\" is a memorable book.      Teenagers would probably enjoy it most of all, since they could identify with Charlie's loneliness and emotional confusion.  Even better, they will get a lesson intolerance, as they read about the human consequences of trying to force a person into a mold into which he simply cannot fit.  As the parent of a retarded boy, I wish everyone could read this book.
B00009AOBI|5.0|This is a review for the Director's Cut Widescreen Edition <br /> <br />Mask deals with the last two years of the life of Rocky Dennis.  Rocky was stricken with a disease that builds up calcium deposits on the skull, deforming the face.  While it has deformed his face, it has not changed anything else, including his spirit. <br /> <br />The doctors are always doom and gloom but as Rusty puts it, if I started to dig a grave every time a doctor told me Rocky was going to die, I'd be eating chow mien right now! <br /> <br />Rocky (Eric Stoltz) is about to start his last year in junior high school.  It is a new school and the principal does not want him there.  But mom, Rusty (Cher), already has that covered.  What the principal doesn't know is that Rocky is extremely bright and despite his disease, he makes friends easily. <br /> <br />Rusty was a stereotypical biker babe of the 70's.  She was hard drinking and a drug addict.  Neither of these pleased Rocky.  In comes, old flame Gar (Sam Elliot).  Gar is definitely more centered than Rusty.  He understands what Rocky has been through and is there for him. <br /> <br />Rusty graduates junior high school with honors and the principal arranges a scholarship at a summer camp for the blind.  At the camp he meets a beautiful blind girl, Anne (Laura Dern).  She knows that he is not normal but sees the perfect soul not the imperfect face.  The camp ends and Rusty meets the parents and of course, they are not pleased.  But when he is picked up by the crew, Rusty announces that she is clean and sober. <br /> <br />Rocky starts High School with the usual complications.  But once again he overcomes them.  But his personal life has taken a turn for the worse.  His best friend is moving in with his father back east and is not going to Europe with Rocky.  Also, Anne's mother has prevented him from contacting her.  He finally tracks Anne down only to find out that she is being sent to a special school. <br /> <br />With all things handed to Rocky he overcomes the disappointments.  But the doctor's predictions finally come true and Rocky succumbs to the disease. <br /> <br />This is a film with a lot of heart and soul.  This is a film about the human spirit and the adversities that God gives us.  Cher won the Cannes Film Festival Best Actress Award.  She should have won an Oscar.  Both Stoltz and Elliott give well faceted and finely layered performances.  This is Bogdonovich's best film since The Last Picture Show. <br /> <br />This is a director's cut and includes two scenes that the studio removed and restored the Springsteen songs that were removed before its opening.  This only makes a great film better. <br /> <br />DVD EXTRAS: <br />Commentary by Peter Bogdonovich <br /> <br />Mask Revisited: A Conversation with Peter Bogdonovich - A 25 minute featurette where Bogdonovich talks about the making of the film from the origins to the final cut. <br />
B000065U1N|5.0|HONORING THE FALLEN SOLDIERS - <br /> <br />The filmmakers made an effective effort at highlighting the stories of the soldiers who were killed and wounded as well as those who demonstrated actions that were above and beyond the call of duty, which frequently included men that fit all three categories. <br /> <br />THE PREMISE: WHAT HAPPENS WHEN AN ELITE GROUP OF SPECIAL FORCES DROP IN ON A GENOCIDAL WARLOARD! <br />      <br />FRONT ROW SEATS AS WE ARE ALL RIGHT THERE FOR THE REAL LIFE EPIC AT MOGADISHU!  <br /> <br />Sensational true account, but not a pretty picture. Somalia was and is truely a tragic place and this film clearly puts a fine point on that. Ridley Scott presents a true, gritty account that makes us feel as if we are on the battlefield, and it does not feel good. It took incredibly valiant efforts by the Rangers and the Delta Force to get the job done and see that no man was left behind. Whereas things went wrong for the American troops, they turned right principally due to their mettle and the support they all gave and received from the \\"man next to them\\".  <br /> <br />WHAT'S IT ALL ABOUT:  <br /> <br />Imagine \\"A Bridge Too Far\\" + \\"The Longest Day\\" in 1 film & give that film Ridley Scott to direct and 21st century special effects to make it all too real! That film would be \\"Black Hawk Down\\"! Of course a wonderful and accurate script augmented by fine acting doesn't hurt.  <br /> <br />Hundreds of thousands of Somalias are unwillingly participants of their own starvation. Food from the United States, the U.N. and the world are getting to the Somalia, but food has turned into a political power issue, and more important than guns to a desperate and despicable warloard and his army. Caught in the marketplace with 2 Black Hawk helicopters down, a 30 minute operation turns into a long afternoon and an even longer night where the entire city seemed to be attacking the American forces.  <br /> <br />ABOUT THE DVD:  <br /> <br />The edition I have has anexcellent transfer, and great sound in a widescreen format. It includes the featurette titled, \\"BLACK HAWK DOWN: ON THE SET\\". It runs about 25 minutes and includes alot of interviews with the cast, crew and military advisors. I wish it were longer. <br /> <br />
B000EHSVOG|4.0|<br />Irwin Allen's Oscar-winning THE TOWERING INFERNO (1974) is a staggering technical achievement and an awesome movie experience, even on a tiny TV screen.  It came out of an era of disaster films that started with Allen's THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE (1972), climaxed with Mark Robson's EARTHQUAKE (1974), and ended with Richard Lester's JUGGERNAUT (1976).  I still remember experiencing INFERNO as a graduate college student in Los Angeles in 1974--900 people at the Avco Cinema Center in Westwood Village and a 165 minute film in Panavision and six-track stereo.  Whoa, mama.  No wonder it garnered an unprecedented eight Oscar nominations, including Best Picture, and three wins. <br /> <br />To an amazing degree, THE TOWERING INFERNO still packs a real emotional wallop.  The story holds up.  Stirling Silliphant's screenplay is beautifully constructed and gripping--the world's tallest building, 138 stories, is about to open in San Francisco.  But after all the guests have reached a penthouse party, a fire breaks out from faulty electrical wiring on the 81st floor.  Pretty soon the whole floor is on fire, with maybe 100 guests at the party up on 135.  Billed above the film's title are Steve McQueen as the fire chief, Paul Newman as the architect, William Holden as the builder, and Faye Dunaway as Newman's girl friend.  The greatest cast I've ever seen in a disaster film also includes, alphabetically, Oscar nominee Fred Astaire as the likeable con artist, Susan Blakely as the wife of nasty son-in-law Richard Chamberlain, Jennifer Jones lovely as the widow who falls for Astaire, O. J. Simpson as the security guard whose big moment is rescuing a cat in a suite on fire, Robert Vaughn as the senator, and Robert Wagner as the publicity man.  All are in excellent form. <br /> <br />So, the challenge is getting everyone up in the penthouse safely down to the ground.  The pyrotechnics are spectacular and, contrary to Leonard Maltin's ridiculous negative review (\\"an all star idiocy\\"), the deaths are ugly; not everyone makes it.  Fire doors are cemented shut and have to be dynamited open!  People have to navigate stairwells on fire.  Floor after floor catches fire.  The scenic glass elevator in the crowded penthouse comes off its moorings and has to be held in place with a Navy helicopter that catches fire from the weight of twelve people in it.  The fire department tries to rig a cable to an adjoining building that it not on fire.  With half of OUR building on fire, McQueen has the idea of dynamiting one million gallons of water tanks on the roof to flood the flaming penthouse.  This movie doesn't have a director, it has a munitions expert! <br /> <br />Actually, it has Irwin Allen doing double duty as both producer and also director of the action sequences. Four units were shooting the movie simultaneously all over 57 sets at 20th Century Fox which, in an unprecented move, joined forces with Warner Bros. Two rival studios did not want to separately film two very similar books, THE TOWER, by Richard Martin Stern, and THE GLASS INFERNO, by Thomas N. Scortia and Frank M. Robinson.  Silliphant, Oscar-winning screenwriter of IN THE HEAT OF THE NIGHT (1967), skillfully blended both books.  John Guillermin gets credit for directing the non-action scenes, which is roughly reels one and two. <br /> <br />THE TOWERING INFERNO packs a wallop as fiery inferno turns into a waterlogged mess.  There is a tempered happy ending.  Enough cast members die to have the film truly be what Allen wanted it to be, a sobering tribute to the firefighters of the world and a cautionary tale to not cut corners when creating buildings to infinity.  Fireman McQueen gets the powerful last lines of a three hour disaster film masterpiece:  \\"You know, we really can't put out a fire above the seventh floor of a building.  People are going to keep dying and we're going to keep showing up to try and put out the blaze until some architect asks US how to build a skyscraper.\\"  Architect Newman replies, \\"They ought to leave it up as a monument to all the bulls--- in the world.  I'm asking.\\" <br /> <br />THE TOWERING INFERNO is a powerful and exhausting movie experience even on home video for 165 minutes, if you watch it in one sitting.  John Williams' Oscar-nominated score is also notable, as always.  The two-disk special DVD edition is huge, including nine all-new featurettes, an old 1977 interview with the late Irwin Allen saying his films work because they have ordinary people surviving extraordinary situations, AMERICAN CINEMATOGRAPHER articles to gruelingly navigate with arrows, and audio commentaries with special effects experts and a film critic.  It is one hell of a movie and one hell of a DVD purchase deal. <br />  <br />
0553804367|5.0|I read a book on a recent flight for recreation called, A Briefer History of Time by Stephen Hawking and Leonard Mlodinow.  It is about quantum physics.  I have huge respect for Stephen Hawking.  He suffers from a terrible disease and is confined to a wheelchair and is basically a quadrapelegic yet he has a brilliant mind and a way of simplifying things that makes it easy to understand.  Stephen Hawking is a physicist and an astronomer and the book deals with both physics and astronomy and the interaction of materials, planets, etc.  It is a totally fascinating book and I would highly recommend it.<br /><br />The only thing that I did not like about the book is that it burst my bubble on Isaac Newton who he claims was not a pleasant man and his relationships with other people were very strained.<br /><br />It is also interesting to read about the relationship between religion and science and how tough it was on people like Galileo.
0060555661|5.0|When it comes to the subject of investment, one cannot speak about it without mentioning the household name, Warren Buffett. After all, this is a man who had made himself the second richest man in the world solely by investing money in companies. It is through learning more about Buffett that lead me to Benjamin Graham and his investment classic, The Intelligent Investor. In this 2003 updated edition, supplementary commentaries and footnotes were added throughout the book by Jason Zweig, a senior writer at Money magazine. This updated edition offers a fresh look at an investment classic, and convinces the reader that the book is still relevant 33 years after Graham's last revision. <br /> <br />Let me begin then with an observation. Nowadays, just about everybody who has worked a day job knows about putting their money in the stock market. There are some who does it out of greed, some out of fear, but the vast majority does it just because everybody else is doing the same thing! It appears to me that only a tiny group of minorities are really making intelligent investment decision. What about the rest? They buy/sell when they feel like it. Emotion is their chief investment advisor, and they listen to it religiously. Is it any wonder that the financial market behaves the way it does? Good news, because one will learn from Graham that the sillier the market's behavior, the greater the opportunity for the business-life investor. <br /> <br />Graham begins by laying out the foundational definition of investment versus speculation. \\"An investment operation is one which, upon thorough analysis, promises safety of principal and an adequate return. Operations not meeting these requirements are speculative.\\" In the following chapters, Graham gives his readers unprecedented access to the stock market history and grants readers the wisdom that are used in developing portfolio policies in the body of the book. Graham's book attempts to inject some transparency into the secret world of finance and he has succeeded abundantly. <br /> <br />The final and most important chapter of this book sums up the secret of sound investment into three words, MARGIN OF SAFETY. To quote, \\"The margin of safety is always dependent on the price paid. It will be large at one price, small at some higher price, nonexistent at some still higher price.\\"  <br /> <br />The Intelligent Investor isn't a book about analyzing companies, but one which really nails into the readers' heads the proper investment principles and attitudes. Professor Graham's academic writing style delivers his powerful ideas in a simple and gentle way.  <br /> <br />To summarize, in the added appendix of the book is an article called Superinvestors of Graham of Doddsville written by Buffett, \\"There seems to be some perverse human characteristic that likes to make easy things difficult... Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace, and those who read their Graham & Dodd will continue to prosper.\\"
630469654X|5.0|Ladyhawke is a midevil fantasy.  Starcrossed lovers have been cursed to be together forever but apart forever.  From sunrise to sunset Isabeau (Michelle Pfeiffer) is hawk.  While from sundown to sunrise, her beloved Navarre (Rutger Hauer) is a wolf.  Into their lives comes Philippe \\"the Mouse\\" Gaston (Matthew Broderick), a petty thief and escape artist.  Philippe has just escaped from prison and is being chased by the guard.  The same guard who Navarre used to be the Captain of the Guard. <br /> <br />Navarre has returned to France to kill the Bishop (John Woods) who cursed Isabeau and himself.  But first he must get through is old command.  In the process, both he and hawk Isabeau are shot with arrows.  Philippe takes Isabeau to the priest Imperius (Leo McKern).  Imperius is the priest that betrayed the couple to the Bishop.  Imerius has been guilt ridden for this and has found a way for the couple to break the curse but Navarre is blinded by his rage and will not listen. <br /> <br />Everything comes to a head at the Bishop's abbey.  Navarre confronts the Bishop but cannot kill him because of his love for Isabeau.  Then something fantastic happens, a day with night and a night without day or as we know it, an eclipse.  This allows both to appear in human form and confront the bishop. <br /> <br />This was an early film in each of the stars careers.  Each had their breakthrough film and were looking for the next big film.  They achieved this with three great performances.  This film did not rely on a special effects but use simple dissolves and lighting. <br /> <br />The only negative that I have with the DVD is that the musical score blares out and if you have the sound right for the music, you can't hear the actor.  If you have the sound right to hear the actors, the music will blast you out of your seat.  But this is more a warning and not a complaint. <br /> <br />DVD EXTRAS: None <br />
B000FQJAIW|2.0|Sorry, but that's the deal breaker for me. I only wanted this set because it would have the ORIGINAL film on DVD. But this release of the original will not be enhanced for widescreen TVs. Bad decision by LucasFilm, and I can't support this type of half-hearted release of the originals on DVD.
B000002UDB|5.0|I just love this album until I herd this Sgt peppers was the best but I donno know now I really like this album like every freekin song is great. Those two album represent a time before and it the band started to have major conflicts but after most of the 12 year old screaming girls sure bith those eras were good but this is when they were ther most focused and it shows.
B000BYA5GO|4.0|Getting ready for a long flight, I selected this DVD because I like Nicholas Cage and the trailers for this moving positioned it as a slightly funny movie as others here have mentioned.  After watching the movie, I was very impressed that the movie could explore a mysterious (to me) topic with all seriousness and sensitivity as well, taking on a semi-political message that is relevant for 2006 and beyond. <br /> <br />I had no idea what an arms dealers do, so I learned a lot from the movie which is based on a set of facts rather than being based in complete fiction.  The Yuri character shows some sensitivity and sadness but all of that is negated by the lure of big money, even when people close to Yuri are killed.  Emotional outpouring is temporary.  Yuri's blood must run ice-cold. <br /> <br />I didn't realize that governments funnel money to arms dealers who supply weapons to one or both sides of a war.  A sobering and irritating concept if it is really true. <br /> <br />I don't see many films that are enjoyable but also send a message.  This is a movie that was both to me.
B000ANVPPQ|5.0|This is a review for the Special Edition widescreen DVD and not the full screen DVD. <br /> <br />McClintock was the final pairing of John Wayne and Maureen O'Hara.  And they have fun with this film. <br /> <br />In the introduction by Leonard Maltin, he states this is based on Taming of the Shrew but if anything this is a sequel twenty years later. <br /> <br />GW McClintock (Wayne) is the cattle baron whose family founded the town of McClintock.  But his family life is a mess.  His wife, Katherine (O'Hara) has left him for a socialite life.   And his daughter, Becky (Stephanie Powers) is returning from College.  Kate has returned to take Becky away from her father's bad influence but GW will not allow it. <br /> <br />What ensues is a great battle of wills and ways.  This film is deeper than just the main story line.  The subplots includes one of John Ford's favorite subjects, the mistreatment of the Native Americans.  <br /> <br />There is not much real plot to this film but a ton of heart.  There were only two actresses that seemed to understand how to act with the Duke, Lauren Bacall and Maureen O'Hara.  O'Hara is on of the great actresses that never received the attention that was she deserved.  This film shows that you can give her something flimsy and she can make it look great.  And like many of Duke's films, this has a great fight scene in which everyone winds up sliding down a mud hill - sometimes twice!!  And the stars did their own stunts.  And the film ends with a great chase scene between O'Hara and Wayne.   <br /> <br />This is one good hoot of a film.  The only thing missing from this film is John Ford behind the camera but they have Ford's constant AD Andrew McLaglen (Son of Oscar winner and constant Ford film star Victor McLaglen.)  It was also early films from Stephanie Powers and Patrick Wayne. <br /> <br />DVD EXTRAS: <br />Commentary by Leonard Malting, Frank Thompson, Maureen O'Hara, Stephanie Powers, Michael Pale, Michael Wayne and Andrew McLaglen <br /> <br />The Batjac Story: The Legacy of Michael Wayne - A 23 minute featurette about the eldest son of Duke and how he created his own way in the industry and outside the industry.  Very Good and informative. <br /> <br />Maureen O'Hara and Stephanie Powers remember McClintock - A 23 minute featurette with the two starts talking about the making of the film.  Maureen O'Hara still is one of the most beautiful women ever and shows she still has style.  Stephanie Powers let you know how much making this film affected her career. <br /> <br />The Corset: Don't Leave Home without It - Featurette about the women's wardrobe <br /> <br />2-Minute Fight School - Two long time Wayne film stuntman show the basics of film fighting. <br />
B00028HBKC|5.0|I waited to see this movie, because I wanted to judge it with cold dispassionate eyes free of the hype and the controversy that surrounded its release. <br /> <br />I grew up in a Catholic Church where the suffering of Jesus was a palpable, in your face reminder of his sacrifice for our sins.  It is not a paradigm I ever appreciated wholly.  As kids we would perform the stations of the cross, following the little plaques around the church, which depict the scenes from the Passion. <br /> <br />Mel Gibson has taken the ritual of the stations, or the notion of the passion play, and he has brought it into sharp focus with this movie.  His depiction of the last hours of Jesus's life is brutal, graphic, bloody and gruesome, and yet it is not gratuitous in any way, shape or form.  At no stage does the violence detract from the power of the central message, that Jesus died for us, that we could live in heaven. <br /> <br />I don't know the impact of this movie on non Christians, but I can say that for a Christian it is a moving, indeed gut wrenching, reaffirmation of the basic tenet of our faith.  It transports you back to a time of childhood innocence when belief in the life and works of Jesus were unquestioned and freely accepted.  As such it succeeds wonderfully as a messianic revival of the Faith. <br /> <br />Artistically it is beautifully filmed in a sensitive manner that involves the viewer as part of the on-screen audience.  The use of Aramaic and Latin are inspired choices, as was the selection of Italian speakers for the Latin.  I was worried that it would sound like Oxbridge Latin with english public school pronounciation, and was pleasently surprised that it didn't. <br /> <br />As for the supposed controversy over anti-semitism - I don't get it.  Perhaps I am not sensitive to it.  But it seemed to me no more than a simple depiction of a power struggle between the Saducee Temple Hierarchy and a troublemaker who needed to be removed.  Herod might have been a bitover the top, but I don't know, I must read the biblical passage and judge that one myself.  I felt the release of Barabas was handled excellently with just the right level of conflict shown by the Church Elders for what they were doing. <br /> <br />I believe this is a film that will stand on its merits for many many years.
B0000028UK|5.0|When I listen to ten i don't think of it as a grunge album just a strait out rock album a very cool one. This is there first grunge album and it is great IMO there is more memorable songs on it like daughter distant and reviewmirrior that have a more grand sound then say black or even flow. You also have rockes animal leach go which are all good this is a great album that in may ways is better then Ten I have yet to hear the new one but what I have herd it my beat there first two.
B000AQBA1W|3.0|On one hand, The Corrs have made a smart move with this album. They've gone back to their celtic roots and have made an album that is more folk and celtic than pop. Which is fine. <br /> <br />But on the other hand, the songs can be quite depressing, both lyrically as well as musically. Especially songs like 'Heart Like A Wheel', 'Moorlough Shore' and 'Peggy Gordon'. <br /> <br />I love The Corrs. They are my one of my favourite bands. But i was quite disappointed with this album. I dont see myself listening to it all the time like i listen to 'Talk on Corners', 'In Blue' and 'Borrowed Heaven'.  <br /> <br />All in all, The Corrs can do much better. This album is good, and has some nice tracks like 'Old Town', 'My Lagan Love' and 'Haste To The Wedding' (which was already on 'In Blue' as a bonus track) but the rest of the album is just not as good as their previous albums. Still, It's worth a listen.
B0000YEEHG|5.0|almost all works of art are personal. so is this one. bergman had the big PERSONAL problem of wanting to dump BIBI for LIV. this can be tricky. bibi and liv were supposedly best friends and bibi had been partly responsible for bergman's early success. bergman solved his problem brilliantly. he created a psychosomatic illness for himself (he \\"couldn't\\" speak and was hospitalized) and then made a symbolic movie (starring both ladies) about the experience. the movie was hailed as a masterpiece (although no one can explain it). this worked wonderfully for bergman. both ladies were happy with the success and bergman added to his reputation as a genius. he also got his new girl. such is the life of the great auteur. in general, when trying to divine the source of great \\"art\\", look close to earth.
B000EMGAOY|2.0|Well, if you like uninspired, recycled Chili Peppers in overabundance...YOU'LL LOVE THIS ALBUM!  I mean, really...this is gruel.  I urge you to rise above the wretched haze of american pop-culture, and relocate/re-establish a natural identity.  For the record, I thought the large of their work previous to this was good music!  Anthony Kiedis is a brilliant person, there's no excuse for this album.  Just as there's no excuse for ignoring that little voice of wisdom that says move on.  ...but they are indeed now richer from having made it!  Yes.  Monetarily.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|Can't wait for the DVD to come out.  I have the LaserDisc which I have watched several times on my antiquated Laserdisc player and it is very good in sound and video quality.  This is the ultimate Pink Floyd collection and is worth the wait so they can do it proper justice.
0425188809|5.0|I recently read Koontz's THE TAKING and it made me want to go and grab some others of his, and I picked up WATCHERS again and reread it over the last couple of days.  I know it's like 15 years old, but it hasn't gotten stale or anything. <br /> <br />Take a tip: read this book.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|It's the story of 1890's France told to the tune of 20th century music and choreography.  If you expect a true period piece, realign your expectations.  This is a grand tour de farce and a cult classic.
B00005JNJV|4.0|Batman Begins succeeds on many levels.  It provides a wide range of fully realized settings.  It guves us a satisfying drama, fleshing out the origins of Bruce Wayne until he became Batman. It is filled many good acting performances, large and small.  And overall, Christopher Nolan made a lot of smart choices in theme and tone, making this version of Batman much more resonant than any other version. <br /> <br />In the final analysis, Batman Begins will be remembered for the performances of Christian Bale, Cillian Murphy, and the fine ensemble supporting cast.  And it should also be remembered for its emphaisis on primal fear as the compelling theme for the story.  What makes Cillian Murphy's Scarecrow so scary, is not that he has fancy gadgets or superhuman powers, it is that he has simply enhanced his ability to scare people out of their wits.  Batman also uses fear as a main weapon.  Christian Bale delivers a wonderful performance because he demonstrates three distinct personas.  The first is Bruce Wayne, from scared little boy, to angry young man, to seeker of justice and revenge. The second is Playboy Bruce Wayne, who is a character he plays (almost exactly the same as his character in American Psycho) for the sake of his public.  And the third is Batman.  The genius of Bale's preformance is that he shows us that he is putting on a performance for the public (as the Playboy) and for cops and criminals (as Batman).  Bale's is a performance inside a performance, and I think that is pretty cool.  I also want to give brief mention to Gary Oldman, who stands out among the supporting cast (who would have thought this was the guy that brought Sid Vicious to the screen?). <br /> <br />The reason this is a 4-star film and not a 5-star film is that, for all its merits, it fails to deliver the action and it ends up being formulaic in the mold of a typical big budget film.  The car chase was pretty good as car chases go, but it was a poor choice.  And while it was fine tobring in a gadgetmeister (Morgan Freeman) to help explain the Batsuit and his various weapons, less would have been more in terms of superpower type stuff.  It wasn't necessary to have Batman fly or have a car that can drive across rooftops.  The grapling hook was well used.  The Batsuit, kick-butt karate, the grapling hook, and a relatively normal Batmobile is about all Batman should have needed to get along.  It would have served the action better to cut out the car chase and improved the hand-to-hand fighting sequences.  And instead of showing how Batman learned to fly, show us a little bit more of Batman as detective.  I mean, show us Batman doing actual detective work, rather than having his very smart allies explain everything to him.  That would have been more apealing: a Batman who is both smart and able to beat up criminals.   <br /> <br />All in all, this was a good movie, regardless of whether you have now, or have enjoyed comic books, or their movie adaptations.  Maybe it is too much to expect a perfect Batman movie given that the cost to produce such a movie will inevitable steer its production toward convnetional and formulaic choices.  I give Christopher Nolan credit for making this Batman somewhat off-beat (in a good way), if not completely perfect.  Maybe the answer is an animated film for adults.  If the Japanese can do it, why can't we?
B0001HLVS2|5.0|I sort of slid into this movie sideways. After watching the Horatio Hornblower series, the Napoleonic age of sail suddenly became my top priority so I rented this, and loved it. As excellent as the Hornblower films are, Master & Commander is even better, more mature or something, more realistic. It has become my favorite movie of all time. Russell Crowe was perfect as Jack Aubrey. If you have read the books (and I have read them all) you will be pleased with the casting. For the purists, the movie takes practically nothing from the actual Patrick O'Brian books, but developed a good story nonetheless. It is too bad, because with 20+ books, they could have made an entire series - or at least a couple more. But, that aside, it is a stunning piece of work. The scene of the ship going around Cape Horn is enough to make one never want to set foot on a boat again, so realistic, magnificent.
B0007Y08IS|5.0|This is a very clever movie and I don't see why some reviewers seem to think it takes sides. Maybe they aren't paying attention. It has been my experience that %5 of the population are stupid enough to be brainwashed by the left or right and turned into babbling, catch-phrase spewing retards. This is satire and should be taken as such. Tre and Matt are absoulte masters of the medium. Great story, great songs and very funny. Phil Hendrie is great in it too. Doug Dannger gives it 2 gay thumbs up! Vote Sewell-Belhaven 2008 for change.

B00005JNRY|3.0|In the end, after a long race and countless detours, Cars comes swinging around the final turn with a pretty nice message about life. About winning and losing. About how to win ... and how to lose. It's a message you hear often enough, but usually it's simply an empty truism without much heart. \\"It's not if you win or lose, but how you play the game,\\" etc., ad nauseum. Cars communicates that message in a genuine, heartfelt way that can't help but reach young and old alike. That, in the end, is what is really good about this film. And, in the end, it's also the most important thing in any movie for children: Do they learn something of lasting value that otherwise might be lost upon them?<br /><br />But, unfortunately, Cars lacks the pacing, vitality, and spirit of Pixar's other films.  The story feels like an early draft that should have been cut and polished -- and cut and polished again. Sequences seem interminable. Points get hashed and rehashed. Movies, especially those for little ones, need to be economical, not bloated. They need to know the point where the length of a scene may destroy its vitality -- and then cut it back way before then. Pixar's done it right so many times, that I've come to take it for granted that its writers are champs at it. Not here.<br /><br />The overwrought nature of the story, coupled with a lack of the adult-oriented (and amusing) subtext that keeps parents interested in the great children's films, makes for a very long ride indeed for folks over forty. In addition, many of the characters seemed like \\"cookie cutter\\" cliches, something that seemed wholly unnecessary and not exactly a view of the world that's good for tender ears.<br /><br />Maybe Cars, when it reaches the shelves on DVD, will result in a first among director's cuts: a shorter movie.<br /><br />Nah. It'll never happen.
B000FQJAIW|5.0|For one I'm glad George is finally releasing the ORIGINAL 1977 version on DVD. I'm not sure, but I believe that might also mean the original opening crawl before \\"episode IV\\" was added (that was in the 1978 re-release). For those of you who keep buying every version that becomes available and then complaining about it, I have two words....common sense. Something that seems to be sadly lacking nowadays. The only copy I ever bought (besides the video disc versions from 25 years ago back when George said he didn't want to release them on home video at all) was the 1997 special edition boxed set on laserdisc. I've waited and waited knowing he'd eventually release the entire saga, complete and finished as he wants them on DVD once he was DONE with the prequels and had ILM do some final fiddling with the effects. That's the version(s) I want. I was surprised to learn he finally caved in and decided to release the original theatrical versions for a limited time. I'm not completely sure, but I have a hunch that he means it this time. The original versions he has stated on numerous occasions were works in progress. When he finally releases the final, \\"ultimate\\", boxed set of the saga, I don't think you're gonna see the theatrical versions in there. I may be wrong. Hopefully I am and we can have the originals in anamorphic widescreen instead of letterboxed as with these limited editions...
B000DWMN2S|5.0|Many movies try to juggle so many balls that one or two eventually get dropped. In \\"Everything is Illuminated\\" while things seem to be going in different directions, they all end up at one place in space, and several places in time. On the surface, the movie is about one man who is trying to piece together a moment in his family's past, another man who knows nothing about his family's past (but will find out), and a third man who knew about his past, deliberately blinded himself to it, only to discover it again in a more \\"illuminated \\" way. <br /> <br />But there is so much more to it than this. The themes are as complex as are the relationships between Jonathan (Wood), Alex (Hutz) and Grandfather Alex (Leskin). Initially, the chemistry among the three guys is both hostile and comic. Alex is as curious about America as Jonathan is about the Ukraine. Grandpa wants nothing to do with either of them. Sammy Davis Jr., Jr., Grandpa's \\"Officious Seeing Eye Bitch\\" makes a new friend. Sounds confusing? It really isn't, thanks to a lot of cleaning of up of the script (the outtakes are obvious distractions, wisely removed).  <br /> <br />As the movie journeys from a clash of cultures to a unity of vision, it becomes a heartbreaking coming together. This is not a simple tear-jerker--it truly breaks your hearts. The illumination is so simple but its consequences are deep and thundering. \\"Everything is Illuminated\\" is as powerful a movie that has come out in the last five years. See it.
B000002UAI|4.0|&#34;Beatles for Sale&#34; sounds very much like a transitional work. Though uneven in terms of structure (at least half the tracks are cover versions), the introspective nature of &#34;I'm a Loser,&#34; &#34;No Reply&#34; and &#34;I'll Follow the Sun&#34; pave the way for greater glories. The overall record would have been stronger if the group had deleted &#34;Mr. Moonlight&#34; and &#34;What You're Doing&#34; - two obvious throwaways.
B000002KHF|5.0|My wife says I don't like anything that's new and modern. That's not true. What is true, for me, is that a lot of the \\"new\\" and \\"modern\\" stuff that's out there just doesn't move me in any kind of way. Maybe I'm being a tad judgmental, but it seems like more and more artists are being more persuaded by the almighty dollar rather than true expression of the soul. I'm not against making money. Money is good. Money is beautiful. But money should never ever drive the human spirit.<br /><br />We now turn our attention to this classic album. In this collection of songs you will soon realize that Morrison sings from those places in the soul that are hardly ever visited. Those deep recesses where imagination, creativity, joy, and passion all intermingle and act as one. This is where all \\"True Magic\\" is born. This is the \\"lowly manger\\" where the bringer of Light is born. People have a tough time visiting this place in the soul because it is so boundless, so intimidating, and yet so ultimately freeing and the only thing that can provide feelings of true success and true fulfillment and no matter how much cash you may be willing to dole out, it cannot be bought because it is absolutely priceless.<br /><br />Van \\"the man\\" Morrison is creating magic in this CD. He is singing to a lover that has no form; a lover that embraces all of creation without hesitation, a lover that is generous and kind and fills every place, every space with an abundant grace that gives mere mortals an opportunity to be divine.<br /><br />This album is Divine in every way and yet it is not to be worshipped. Once something becomes worshipped, the magic disintegrates and loses its original power to awaken and inspire. This collection of songs has never failed to inspire me. It has always given me Light, Life, and Love. Freely and easily. I am grateful that somehow I was lead and directed to this recording. I often wonder if I was guided to it or was it guided to me? I guess it doesn't matter because we found each other.<br /><br />I have a time capsule of sorts and in it are a few photos, some memorable letters, a couple of books, and a few CDs and if I should ever grow old and senile with a few marbles rolling around upstairs, my wife is instructed to pull out the time capsule and remind me of the things I once found to be pieces of Heaven. This CD is in that capsule and it is very debateable if whether or not this is a piece of Heaven or Heaven Itself.<br /><br />It truly is a beautiful thing...e found each other. <br /> <br />I have a time capsule of sorts and in it are a few photos, some memorable letters, a couple of books, and a few CDs and if I should ever grow old and senile with a few marbles rolling around upstairs, my wife is instructed to pull out the time capsule and remind me of the things I once found to be pieces of Heaven.

B000FILW86|5.0|The best band of the 70s has only faltered a few times since it's inception (\\"The Doctor\\", \\"Busted\\" and \\"Special One\\") but has made it clear over the past few years that their debut album was not only one of the 10 best debut albums in rock history, but a legacy that they would never turn their back on. The producer that helped to make that record such a milestone, Jack Douglass, is back on this CD, and it shows. Every song on the CD could astound listeners on even today's radio formats (my favorite track at the moment, \\"This Time You Got It\\", sounds like their Move-influenced rockers of yesteryear). Cheap Trick is my favorite band of all time, and I could not possibly be prouder of them than I am right now because of \\"Rockford\\". Their massive influence on other rock bands over the last 30 years just got that much bigger. If the so-called \\"R&R Hall of Fame\\" does not induct Cheap Trick soon (indeed, without The Cheaps, half of the rock bands of the past 30 years would never have been), that organization will be nothing but a sad joke in the eyes of true rockers everywhere.
B000EXDS5M|5.0|This movie is almost 40 years old...can you believe it? To those of you who haven't seen this classic, my only question to you is, why? Why in the world have you been depriving yourself of something so incredible, so wonderful, so fun, so beautiful. It is just one of those movies that makes you almost kind of sad that we don't have filmakers and storytellers like we used to. We have become a group of people who are more interested in constant action, that we have forgotten how to tell a story. We have become a group of people who desire to be constantly stimulated rather than allowing ourselves to get interested and involved. If this movie was created in today's market - and it pains me to say this - it would be a box office flop.<br /><br />But fortunately, it was made when it was made. Fortunately it had three of the most talented actors of our time in it; the always incredible Paul Newman, the likeable Robert Redford, and the stunningly gorgeous Katherine Ross. The combination of these three characters is absolutely magical. If they made this movie today it would probably have in it; Brad Pitt, Ben Affleck, and Jennifer Lopez. YUK! I better shutup before somebody gets a bright idea of remaking this classic movie. I cannot even imagine somebody having the gall to even try and redo this jewel of a movie.<br /><br />Everything in this movie is top notch. Every scene is just gorgeous and full. I was just a kid when I first saw it and I didn't fully understand all the layers that this movie contains. Now in my early 40s, I truly appreciate Roy Hill's vision. Everything seems so natural. There is nothing forced in this movie. There is nothing contrived. There is nothing but pure movie magic. If you've been waiting for an invitation to finally see this movie, consider this your invitation.<br /><br />But, I warn you...do not buy it if your attention span is less than four seconds. So if you've read this entire review without changing the television channel or talking on the cell phone or text messaging one of your \\"homies\\" then you passed the test and you are free to view this incredible piece of cinema.lking on the cell phone or text messaging one of your \\"homies\\" then you passed the test and you are free to view this incredible piece of cinema.
B000E1ZBFY|4.0|This biopic is well done, true to life in terms of sets and costumes. This is no amateur production. The principal actors themselves are Polish: Piotr Adamczyk played Karol Wojtyla and Malgorzata Bela played leading lady, a platonic love never consumated. Obviously, there were some liberties taken here, but they do not detract much from the known trajectory of the Pope's life. <br /> <br />Adamczyk plays a convincing Wojtyla, reacting with profound emotions and absorption to every evil he sees. This is consontant with Wojtyla's phenomenological leanings. He was able to capture the late Pope's penetrating gaze and ample smile.  <br /> <br />Main bad guys: Matt Craven, who played Hans Frank, Poland's Nazi governor and Hristo Shopov, whose name has been grievously omitted from the Cast Biographies and the Media Kit available from the distributor's website. We all know Shopov: he played Pontius Pilate in the Passion of the Christ. The guy has a nack to play evil dudes. In this movie, he played a Polish Communist apparatchik who tries to capture Wojtyla in a fumble that would justify his arrest, but can't. <br /> <br />Supporting cast: Raoul Bova played Father Thomasz Zaleski, pastor of Wawel Cathedral in Cracow and a mentor of young Karol. Zaleski lost his life at the whim of Governor Hans Frank. Ennio Fantasthichini played Nowak, a mine worker Wojtyla befriended while working at the Solway quarry who became a lifelong friend and mentor of sorts. There are more, but these are the ones I have the most information for the moment. I want to say that no secondary character was wasted in this movie; all of them contributed actively to the setting, to the environment, and to the pathos of the movie. <br /> <br />The script: In my opinion, perhaps the one thing that could have been improved. Sometimes the character appear to be delivering one-liners that sort of \\"cruise\\" past the other. In his more pedagogic moments, Wojtyla seems to be delivering straight quotes from the Pope's own works: _Love and Responsibility_ and _The Acting Person_. Adamski's delivery of these lines is magisterial and saves the day. He was able to integrate seamlessly them into a normal dialogue. <br /> <br />If the late Pope was like this, no wonder he is so beloved!
0590085247|5.0|The story is about a year of a family's life in a log cabin in a forest in Wisconsin.  The main character is Laura, who lives with her Ma, Pa, older sister Mary and baby sister Carrie.  We follow them as they collect food for the winter, deal with dangers, like bears and cold winters, and make a life for themselves in the middle of the big woods.  The details are somewhat realistic, like how to make Johnny cakes, maple sugar and cheese, yet there seems to be a lot of fun times.  I think it is a well balanced story and I remember my Mom reading it to me when I was a child.
B000001FAO|5.0|Forged from technical expertise and personal animosity---remember Ginger Baker and Jack Bruce were at war with one another back then---Cream came screaming across the music scene of the late '60s as a powerhouse that demanded to be heard.<br /><br />\\"Sunshine of Your Love,\\" \\"Tales Of Brave Ulysses\\" and \\"We're Going Wrong\\" are perhaps the best known tracks on a stellar album, though \\"World of Pain\\" and \\"Dance the Night Away\\" may best represent the prevailing vibe of the time.<br /><br />Though he did not write much of the material and what he did write tended to be eccentric, Ginger Baker clearly powered this trio with his amazing time signatures and ability to match Bruce or Clapton's inventiveness. Jack Bruce seemed to be in his element here: solid, clean bass lines and gutty vocals. Eric Clapton was on a mission back then, and his inspired work throughout this recording lives up to any hype.<br /><br />If you only buy one Cream recording (excluding the artifical anthologies and best of's), I think this is the one to have for it is more mature than \\"Fresh Cream\\" and largely lacks the excesses that marred parts of \\"Wheels of Fire.\\" The weaker tracks, such as Blue Condition, have not improved with age, however.
0312997221|4.0|This was a great effort by Forsythe.  He provided the reader with just enough history to explain the present.  Dexter was a very enigmatic character whom readers can identify with. He's a guy who fights for the underdog while bringing criminals to justice when no one else will.   <br /> <br />The book's last 100 pages were extremely intense.
0767817664|3.0|Fright Night is an enjoyable horror.  Its fast paced simple story keeps you watching as to how a young teenager tackles the fact that a vampire has moved in next door to him.  Fright Night is a very predictable 80's horror flick with bubbly performances from its teenager stars and the over exaggerated acting from its adult leads.  Don't get me wrong, the acting IS acceptable for this type of film and works well.  Keeping to the theme of the film, strange things start to happen (for example): a coffin is seen brought into the house next door, a mysterious man is seen with a woman and a body in a bag is seen dragged out of the house.  Of coarse this all leads up to one thing, that there is a vampire living in the next house and the frightened tenager tries to warn everybody before the vampire kills again.  It not surprising what happens next, as the vampire visits and fights back (but for some strange reason) with comedic effect.<br /><br />Fright Night does have a lot of ridiculous but humerous moments with 80's style make up and special effects.  The special effects however, are quite good and impressive for its time.  Eventhough this film is very enjoyable and a good Halloween flick, it does have a couple of flaws.  One is that the story is very simple and dreary, while the second is that some parts of the film could have been done better.<br /><br />Overall, Fright Night is a forgetable film but it is very entertaining and fun to watch.  Its a film I would give 3 1/2 stars if I could.  So I gave it 3, as it will take me a while to watch again.
B00005JO20|2.0|The best part of the whole film is the ape. Superb special effects bring Kong to life but I didn't need 3 hours to admire it. Mingled in between for what seemed like eternity was a bit lifted right out of Jurassic Park replete with horrible special effects looking like they were from a cheap Japanese Godzilla film years ago (they obviously spent all of the effects budget on the ape). And... someone PLEASE tell Jack Black to take some acting classes. How a marginal talent like this guy lands a gig like this movie is beyond me. Completely mis-cast with that dopey half smirk on his face the whole 3 hours. If you want to see King Kong, the original is still by far the best. ** BnB Beatles Depot **
B00005ASOI|4.0|Of all the rumours that I have heard about Suspiria, i've finally got my hands on it.  With numerous critics saying its \\"one of the most scariest films of all time\\"{from Entertainment Weekly}, and a masterpiece in horror.  Well it's not!  It's not scary what so ever and it isn't really a horror masterpiece, but its still very good.  For it's time, Suspiria was probably a very effective horror, but now it isn't as shocking and as scary as every critic has said it is.  Suspiria IS very over-rated and I can only see people with a very nervious disposition being scared of this film.<br /><br />On the other hand, Suspiria is extremely artistic and unique looking.  With a repetitive use of blue,red and green lights in every scene.  The music is also very repetitive and wierd, creating  an uneasy atmosphere throughout.<br /><br />I found Suspiria not scary at all.  It is a wierd and an enjoyable horror thats perfect to watch at Halloween.  It's a very good horror but its far from being a masterpiece, as it does not live up to masterpieces such as The Shining, Halloween or The Exorcist.<br /><br />For its uniqueness, this is a must see horror in my opinion.
6305313687|5.0|American History X is deeply moving, dripping with importance, and incredibly daring to say the least. What a movie this is, Norton plays a former Neo-Nazi who has just been released from prison. His younger brother played by Edward Furlong has now followed in his former footsteps, as Derrick (Norton) tries to reform his baby brother not to hate, he recalls the last several years in prison, how he was brutally raped and struck an unlikely friendship with a black inmate. The film travels between color and black and white images. The ending still gets me to this day, a movie you have to see. I highly recommend this realistic portrait of one man's determination to make right with an uncertain future and his embarrassing past.
0393316041|5.0|\\"Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!\\" is simply one of the best books I've read.  It's funny, witty, informative, and interesting.  But most of all, it's entertaining. <br /> <br />Despite my utter infatuation with this book, I believe a \\"Reader Beware\\" is in order: To truly enjoy this book, I would suggest that you have at least some interest in science.  Feynman's antics aren't difficult to understand, but if you don't like science, you might feel a bit on the outside of some inside jokes. <br /> <br />As for the accusations regarding Feynman's arrogance, they're not unfounded.  But it boils down to this: a smart guy poking fun at some dumber guys.  I found it funny.  Some people don't.  If you've never giggled in class when someone gave a really dumb answer to a question, you may not enjoy this book. <br /> <br />Overall, \\"Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!\\" is an excellent piece of literature.  It's an incredibly fun read.
B00002MZ4W|3.0|Fiona Apple's When the Pawn... is an ok album of sorts. Boy is she angry and pissed on these songs. After that MTV fiasco in 1997, Fiona became an outspoken and muchly hated woman for speaking her mind. This album is very different from her debut album, Tidal. Standout tracks include: Limp, Fast as you Can, Love Ridden, Paperbag, Get Gone, and The Way Things Are. The rest of the songs I didn't care for, nothing drastically wrong with them just middle of the road tracks. Some of the songs are too jazzy and slow for my taste. But the songs I do like are strong and gutsy, especially the song Limp, \\"You feed the beast I have within me, you wave the red flag baby you make it run, run, run, standing on the sidelines waving and grining, you fondle my trigger then you blame my gun...\\" The song Love Ridden would actually fit better on her Tidal album, haunting and gorgeous song though, \\"Love ridden I've looked at you, with the focus I gave to my birthday candles, I've wished on the lidded blue flames under your brow and baby I wished for you...\\" When the Pawn shines in certain places but otherwise average to my picky ears.
0671027344|3.0|I'm getting certified to teach English, so I read this book because I know a lot of high schools have their students read it.  Although I found it to be an easy read (you can zip through it in no time), I never really got into it that much.  The voice of the narrator, supposedly 16-year-old Charlie, sounded more like an adult trying to sound like a high school student than it did the real thing.  Also, it seemed like the author tried to smash every possible teenage trauma into this book.  Rape, premarital sex, abortion, sexual abuse, drugs, alcohol, homosexuality, suicide...it's all here..as experienced by one troubled young man in one year of school!  A bit much. Also, the style of the book--having it be in the form of letters from Charlie to someone he doesn't even know, grew old and stilted very quickly.  Still, as a departure point for discussion of sensitive issues, I suppose it would be hard to find a book that covers more of them.  It'll never rank up there with the classics, but for the moment it's popular and I suppose worth reading for that reason.  Esp. if you're a parent of a kid reading it in school.
B000002UAO|5.0|Well not many people will deny about the fact about the greatness of the Beatles.They produced some of the finest music ever written had one of the most succesful careers ever.Rubber soul is fantastic,buy it.
B00003CXD0|5.0|Very little to add.  One of the funniest movies ever made.  Moreover, the movie is far more than just funny - it also explores very worthwhile aspects of gender politics and taboos, and the script is extremely well written and believable (there are no false lines).  Outstanding acting all around, although Dustin Hoffman (one of the premier actors of the 20th and 21st centuries, in the opinion of this reviewer) clearly steals the show in perhaps his greatest, least typical role.  In almost any other year, Hoffman would have won the Best Actor Oscar for his portrayal, and the movie itself would have won the Best Picture Oscar.  Unfortunately, it was 1982, and Hoffman and \\"Tootsie\\" were up against Ben Kingsley and \\"Gandhi\\".    Also, one final correction to a previous review - Teri Garr actually played the confused (actually, misled) girlfriend of Dustin Hoffman's male character, not Jessica Lange.

B00005JP4U|5.0|This is a film worth seeing. It is unbelievable how many people want to keep the blinders on and let the planet go by the wayside, starting with the movie theaters that waste energy by keeping people in a refrigerator for three hours when it's not even above 65 degrees outside.

All the qualities that made people love her thirty years ago are still there.No her voice isnt as pretty as it used to be.

Who else could sing lyrics like that? You go Stevie!
B000AL730O|5.0|If you liked Sir Paul's first solo effort, you will LOVE this CD.  It is vintage Paul which in my opinion is excellent music hands down.    There is no one great song that stands out as a classic, but all the songs are excellent as a body of work.
0790731452|2.0|The title sums it up. Not a movie worth watching. Some interesting concepts, but overall a coked-up, mean-spirited waste of time and effort. Do yourself a favor and buy a copy of Terry Gilliam's \\"Time Bandits\\" or \\"Baron Munchausen\\" instead, you know, an actual film that's worth watching.<br /><br />Movies like \\"Mars Attacks\\" makes me want to see laws passed to drug test every director, producer and editor on this planet. Evil, unfunny crap. There's an undercurrent of lowbrow meanness that can't be ignored. Really a rotten film.

Saw him on Austin City Limits and he's just a nice humble guy or at least acts like one. <br /> <br />You can play this music at work without offending anyone and at home you can crank it up and enjoy the excellent musicianship.
0385504209|1.0|This book is full of falsehoods. Anyone who has read the Bible knows that. Jesus did not marry. He was without any sin. I believe that this novel--even though it is fiction to an extent--is influencing the readers against God. That is something this nation cannot afford. If we turn from God, who will save us when we are in danger of falling?<br /><br />I would not recommend this book to anyone.
B0000DYJM6|5.0|Pearl Jam is one of my favorite bands, and when you love a band it's only natural to want every song they've released. Well, in the case of Pearl Jam, you'd have to spend a small fortune to track down each and every single, EP, what have you, so a B Sides and Rarities CD is a perfect idea. Good, strange, and all out ridiculous, almost all of it is here.<br /><br />Having stated that Pearl Jam is quite possibly my favorite band I can now say that I honestly don't like every song included, although, probably 3/4 of this 2 CD set is nothing short of amazing. PJ is one of those bands that can experiment with their sound easily. One song could be achingly beautiful (Footsteps), and the next can be purely catchy rock (Dirty Frank). Whatever style their using, a lot of the time it works.<br /><br />There's a lot of debate as to which CD is better so I'll throw my two cents out there as well. I personally like the second disc better. I mean you got Fatal, Hard To Imagine, Footsteps, Drifting, and Dirty Frank. All of which could be considered PJ at their best. The first CD doesn't lack any amount of great songs either, however. Down, Don't Gimme No Lip, Leavin' Here, and Yellow Ledbetter are all fantastic as well. So whatever your preference is, rest assured you'll be hearing excellent songs.<br /><br />As complete as this collection feels, there are still a few great songs missing. Where's Long Road? Where's Gimme Some Truth? Where's Ed's solo You've Got To Hide Your Love Away? Even some of the covers they play in concert like Crown Of Thorns, Crazy Mary, Rockin' In The Free World, or I Believe In Miracles would've been nice. But despite those misses, there's no complaints on my behalf.<br /><br />My favorite songs are Down, Yellow Ledbetter, Fatal, Hard To Imagine, Footsteps, and Dirty Frank. I'm not convinced that any random listener could listen to Lost Dogs and really see the beauty in it like a PJ fan would/does, but hey, anything's possible. If you are a PJ fan and have yet to hear this though, you truly are missing out, the songs sound fantastic and all have their own feel, this is definitely money well spent.n and have yet to hear this though, you truly are missing out, the songs sound fantastic and all have their own feel, this is definitely money well spent.

It will keep you entertaned to the end. <br />       V FOR VENDETTA is a powerful story about loss of freedom and individuality, the story takes place in England following a bazar war that changed the face of the planet. In a world with no freedom or precious little faith in anything comes a mysterious man in a mask who fights political oppressors through terrorism and seemingly absurd acts. this is a gripping tale of the blurred lines between good and evil. <br />      I relley liked this stoy but felt that there where som
B00005R2M3|4.0|In her unmissable CD 'Laundry Service', Shakira kicks off with 3 of her best and best known tracks; 'Objection', 'Underneath Your Clothes' and 'Whenever, Wherever'. The second and third tracks of the album show the large variety of music that Shakira can make her own. She is able to move seemlessly from the beautiful and more toned down 'Underneath Your Clothes' to the fantastically infectious 'Whenever, Wherever' without breaking stride.    One or two less impressive tracks in the middle of the album such as 'Ready for the Good Times' and 'Fool' are more than made up for when Shakira switches to Spanish from 'Te Dejo Madrid' onwards. It would seem that Shakira benefits from singing in her native language, as her voice sounds a little more at home on Spanish tracks such as 'Que Me Quedes Tu' and the excellent 'Suerte'. Indeed I would urge Shakira fans to buy 'Fijacion Oral', the original Spanish version of her new album as it is definitely one to try out.    Overall 'Laundry Service' is an album for anyone who likes passion, energy and soul in their music and is an excellent listen.
0312954468|4.0|I've never been much on books set in ancient Egypt, but I've become familiar with Wilbur Smith's other works and thought I'd give it a try.  I'm so glad I did!  This book was engrossing and entertaining...I literally couldn't put it down.  The story is told from the point of view of a slave, Taita, but is told in such a way that you get a feel for all of the characters.  The story spans the life of Taita's mistress (owner, not lover!) and her love of one man.  I don't want to give away the story to those who might want to read it, but just take my word for it..this story is worth it.  The historical detail is exquisite and the story is never slow.  My only critism of this book is that Taita seems to be an unlikely character, in that he is an expert in EVERYTHING...medicine, engineering, naval science...you name it and he seems to be the expert.  This does not detract from the book in anyway, however.  I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants pure entertainment.
B0000399WC|3.0|This movie cuts out much of the facts that are told in the book. For example, Dega wasn't in the first attempt to escape, it was Papillon, Maturette and Clousiot. And Clousiot was the one who broke his leg, not Dega. And also, Julot wasn't killed, he escaped. There are many other things which I will not mention, in order to not give it away.<br /><br />  The movie doesn't mention many of his adventures and attempts to escape. This is supposed to be a true story but they messed it up.<br /><br />  I gave this three stars because of the superb acting out of the facts that are brought to life in the movie.<br /><br />  Overall, there is pretty good acting in this movie, but let me say this: If you're going to change so much of a story which truly took place, don't bother making the movie at all.<br /><br />  P.S. I would strongly recommend reading Banco, the story of Charriere's life in Venezuela after his escape.<br /><br />  Thanks!
B000EXDS5M|4.0|On the first disc and carried over from the previous special edition is an audio commentary by director George Roy Hill, lyricist Hal David, documentary director Robert Crawford and cinematographer Conrad Hall.

Are you or any one else really that stupid to think that a two hundered million dollar movie won't deliver? Come on, give it a break, see it first then we'll all pay some attention to your gargage. Here they are giving us a Superman movie with an outrageous budget and the best you can do is fill a toilet bowl with nonsense.
B00005JMEW|4.0|Now obviously this movie is basically a homage to old school kung fu movies.  But he also puts that great tarantino touch on it by making it an actual movie, as unbelievable as it is, and putting in his great dialogue, and I would have to say that this is the best movie he has directed to date next to pulp fiction.<br /><br />The first fight of the movie is spectacular and always gets ripped on by huge martial arts fans.  Let me fill you people in on something, this is Vivica A. Fox and Uma Thurman going at it, not exactly Michelle Yeoh vs. Ziyi Zhang or Moon Lee vs, Yukari Oshima, but they both perform exactly what that scene needed. In fact  everyone produces in every screen.  With how tall Uma is I thought she was definitely the best performer in the movie.  I like part 1 more than 2 but Pai Mei almost put that one over this.<br /><br />But the way tarantino manages to pay homage is magnificent.  Like the scene where Hanzo says to Uma \\"cut down Buddha if he stands in your way\\".  That is a great line but the significance is so much greater if you are a fan of tehse movies.  Tarantino does a good job of no COMPLETELY stealing a scene from an old school flick.  Like when he stole the ear scene from one of my favs \\"Ninja In the Dragon's Den\\", he didn't rip it all the way off, he could have made Michael Madsen even funnier and cooler if that is believable.  But the \\"Buddha\\" line comes form \\"Shogun's Samurai\\" where the prince's fencing instructor tells him a way better line that you will have to see to find out what it is, but I love it how tarantino could have stolen the whole line to make a better, but he has that respect.  Also Sonny Chiba is in that movie and he ALSO played a character name Hattori Hanzo in a show called Hattori Hanzo which unfortunaly will never get released in America:(  Or he comes up with something original all on his own where Uma has chopped up everybody at Lucy Lui's  house and  this little like 15 year old is holding a sword to Uma and is shaking like crazy and Uma asks him \\"why aren't you in school\\"?  That is a great point, it does always seem like in all these movies everybody just trains in martial arts and nobody works or goes to school to actually get an education.  It may take a little while to sink in, but you will extra appreciate that scene because of the way he is actually making fun of old school kung fu.  So by the end of this one we get a sin city type of feeling and you know that you can't wait to pop in volume 2 after seeing this.<br /><br />Extras are pretty much nothing but like 15-20 minutes of good insight on the movie.  But I really cannot recommend this DVD only because a special edition HAS to be coming out soon with tons of extras and at least one commentary I would think.  Anyone know any news of these?and is shaking like crazy and Uma asks him \\"why aren't you in school\\"?

B000F7CMRW|5.0|This is an incredibly realistic movie to the point that some times you forget you are watching a movie and you think you are watching a documentary. At the end of the movie there is no redemption... The situation on the world scene seems to be hopeless due to big interests on the oil field and blind religious fanatism. George Clooney's performance is great and Matt Damon plays his role in a simple and abstract way. This movie should trouble everybody especially the ones that are taking the lead in world matters.
B00005JMUA|4.0|I mean what did you go into a movie called \\"Kill Bill\\" expecting.  Also it is a tarantino movie so you had to expect the dialogue to be extremely interesting.  I bet if John Wayne was around today, he woould say, goddam that was good.  I would actually recommend part 2 over part 1 for non kung fu fans, they are 2 totally different movies.  And I actually like 2 better because of the addition of Pei Mei.  I thought it was a little odd that he was not portryed as the shaolin traitor as, well, that is what he was and that is where the term \\"White Brow\\" and the evil association comes from.  But that is tarantino's brilliance, they don't even tell you whether or not he is the shaolin traitor.  They don't let you know whether he is good or bad.  I would guess that he was set in a time before he betrayed shaolin , hell I don't even know, but a great appearence.  So they couldn't get the guy who always played Pei Mei (Lo lieh) because he unfortunately died right before filming.  So he got the actor who fought Pei Mei in the classic Fists of the White Lotus, that's right Masterkiller himself, Gordon Liu.  He is also in the first movie but I will let you watch and discover his unbelievable shaolin skills in the first movie for yourself.  Alright, if you can't find him, he is the leader of the crazy 88's, the guy with the mask over the top part of his face.  There is also a character actor who plays a different role in each movie.  So  Pei Mei comes in and again tarantino  manages to match his excellent dialogue with brialliant fight scenes.  Or better descriptionwould be---fight special effects.  Still good action though.  It gets devastatingly sad at the end and the I would have really liked the final fight scene to have been a good one.  But that is not really whaty this movie was about.  But fyi-this scene comes from Brigitte Lin's \\"Deadful Melody\\".  But overall Kill Bill is WAY better than that flick.  It was a showcase of tarantin's briliantly written movie and more than excaptable kung fu action.  So please, don't act like you didn't know what this movie was going to be about before you watch it.  I mean did oyu just watch the first five minites so you could make sure you didn't like it?  That sucks!<br /><br />So just like ALL of tarantino's movies, he makes a MOVIE.  Something for you to watch and enjoy.  This is not a guy who goes through all this just to make money.  He does it for the sole reason of wanting to let people see awesome movies.<br /><br />The music  continues to be wonderful with a mix of original scoring and more classics.<br /><br />The special features are again really nothing at all just like Part 1 and you people do all realize that a special edition is bound to come out.  Whenever Quentin's next mvoei comes out, is when I am really hoping that they release it.  i guarantee it will be at least a 2 disc and am hoing for a 3 disc or something. Any movie buffs have an early word on this?  If so please tell me.an excaptable kung fu action.  So please, don't act like you didn't know what this movie was going to be about before you watch it.

We also enjoying matching the jammies we are wearing with the ones in the book. \\"Some and red, some are blue,  . . . they might be stripey, or polka dot, but we can all pajammy in whatever we got.\\" The book also ends gently and the ending helps makes the nights when they would rather not go to sleep more fun. We always look forward to reading this book.
B000EULJLU|5.0|By now it's clear that Tool don't do anything in a hurry. After a gap between albums of five years they've produced one called 10,000 Days, which takes pretty much that long to listen to. But that's not to say it's dull. Far from it. <br /> <br />Sure, it's not the high-octane metal you'll use to get you through a gym workout. It's more a concept album where the pace and energy ebbs and flows, sometimes building to a climax over several minutes (as with the tracks \\"Wings For Marie\\" and \\"10,000 Days\\"). You have to decide whether you're content to sit tight and enjoy the journey. <br /> <br />And it's a journey worth making. Those who do go the distance will be well rewarded with a richly layered and musically complex album with intelligent and serious lyrics about morality, mortality and a little maddness. Personally, I rate this better than Tool's previous release, Lateralus. <br /> <br />There are slow patches in 10,000 Days - the tracks \\"Lipon Conjuring\\" and \\"Lost Keys\\" appear designed as interludes or preludes - that don't quite work for mine. But you can easily overlook the filler when the rest of the album is so great. 10,000 Days could easily become one of those albums against which all others are judged. It's worth the wait.

0393317552|4.0|There can be no doubt that this best selling, Pulitzer Prize winning book penned by Jared Diamond in 1999 is a brilliant work that gets all the praise it deserves. So, why only 4 stars? Well, if you read my bio I state a 5 star book, \\"is something I consider absolutely brilliant.\\" At the end of this literary journey, I cannot say this was absolutely brilliant. It was well done, no doubt. But the task here is so immense, there is virtually no mortal who could put out a 5 star book covering all the aspects present. <br /> <br />This is not to say Diamond doesn't do a decent job, because he does. Ignoring the debate about his accuracy, which I will leave for later in the review, Diamond proffers and defends an array of theories which are intriguing and well-researched. He takes a look at several cultures which may have started on even-footing and dissects exactly why one rose so fast and the other was left in the dust. While these explanations have been debated, there can be no doubt that the explanatory power of much of what Diamond says is, at the very least, well worth considering. <br /> <br />The book takes on cultures, and the rise of guns, germs, and steel, but which also encompasses food production, technology, writing, social systems, and geography, among many other things. The book starts out shot from a cannon. The first 100 pages are riveting. Several of my friends read 100 pages and said it was one of the best books they had ever laid eyes on. <br /> <br />This soon fades when pages 100-200 grow somewhat tiresome, as the point Diamond tries to drive home starts to lose much of its luster. Of those friends who praised the book after 100 pages, I'm don't believe any of them got through the next 100. It's understandable, as the book bogs down in academic explanations that tend to turn the reader off as opposed to drawing them in. I found these pages difficult and boring, as well as repetitive. It's understandable that many lose focus and dismiss the book at this stage. <br /> <br />The second half regains the promise of the first 100 pages. While I'm not sure the last 5 chapters fit the theme of the book, per se, they do a good job keeping the reader interested in the subject matter. Granted, by the end you know what he's going to say before he says it. Still, what he says is not without merit. <br /> <br />A quick search on the Internet reveals a whole host of discussions on this book. I found the wikipedia.org site a very good start. But then, I also found I wasn't interested in reading what the academics and pseudo-academics thought to be lacking in the book. So, I will leave the high-level discussion to them and throw in my 2 measly cents. <br /> <br />Aside from the initial thoughts on the wide area of focus, Diamond uses a litany of sleight of hand tricks to state what he proffers as obvious conclusions. Before I explain, it should be noted that the prevalence of the word \\"clearly\\" in supporting his own assertions only supports my contention that he was starting to resort to hand-waving to get the job finished. Any well reasoned argument does not need to have the word \\"clearly\\" appended to it. Clearly, it stands on its own. See what I mean? <br /> <br />My objection to some of Diamond's claims are based on ignoring certain factors while stressing others, then flip-flopping in the next section. For instance, the north-south axis of geography is repeatedly cited as a reason agriculture spread so slowly in the Americas, but that gets ignored when talking about China. This is a specific example of a trait I dislike with this book. Too often I felt a lack of supporting evidence was given to ignore a previously heavy factor, and vice versa. <br /> <br />In all, I enjoyed this book despite its bogging down at times. I read the book slowly, consuming no more than 30 pages a day. I read the Further Reading section with a highlighter, because the topics discussed were sometimes so interesting I immediately wanted to know more about, say the QWERTY keyboard. That alone speaks volumes about how interesting the book reads on occasion. <br /> <br />I think this appeals to a wide audience, but those tempted to pick it up because it is a best seller are biting off more than they can chew. Good money says the vast majority of those who bought it never finished it. It's a thick book, and if you're not prepared to think, don't bother. Assuredly academics in the field shouldn't waste their time. But laymen like myself who fancy themselves somewhat academic can find a lot of value. Those interested in an attempt at world history in a mere 400 pages can certainly do a lot worse. <br /> <br />Highly recommended, but with caveats.
B000F6IOC0|3.0|Underworld-Evolution is a highly visual action film.  Gorgeously art directed with gothic upon gothic scenery, and curious lighting which gave everything a tinge of blue.<br /><br />The acting was very good.  I would have loved to see more of Derek Jacobi who gave life to the script--but he only shows up in the last few scenes.  Some of the action sequences move too quickly for me plus a little too many CGI effects--sometimes I was not sure what was going on except that lots of squishy fluids were spurting from various hairy body parts!<br /><br />Overall a fun movie to watch--probably would be best to see it on the big screen.

Torn from everything she's known, her foster father shows her the power of words as the two of them share late night reading sessions of The Grave Digger's Handbook.  Her love of books ties her to others, including the mayor's wife and Max, the Jew the family hides in the basement.<br /><br />My own words escape me as I try to recount the beauty of this book in a short review.  Rarely have I read a book as moving, as profound, as this one.  Narrated by Death, this story is one that crawls under your skin and reverberates your soul with its images of Nazi Germany, friendship, and loss.  The images stirred through Death's telling are so vivid, so wonderful, so tragic.  Zusak has a masterful command of language and I was astounded by the way his words brought Liesel and her world to life.  We follow Liesel over the years as she learns the true meaning of family through her caring new Papa and her friendships with Max and Rudy, the boy next door who idolizes Jesse Owens.<br /><br />Just a small list of images that will stay with me forever:<br /><br />+Liesel reading to the neighbors sitting terrified in a basement waiting for the bombs to fall around them<br /><br />+A snowball fight in a basement<br /><br />+Mama arriving at school to \\"yell\\" at Liesel<br /><br />+A boy with candlelit hair standing up to a Nazi Youth Leader<br /><br />+Death gathering up the souls of children softly<br /><br />+The story of a Word Shaker<br /><br />+An accordian player accepting a cigarette as payment<br /><br />There are not enough words within me to express the beauty of this book.

0143058525|4.0|The unabridged audio of this book is read by the author in an engaging production.  The author struggles, obsesses, and slowly begins to shed some of the unproductive thinking that she carts around the world with her.  The first of the three sections, on Italy, provides the best listening, but then isn't pleasure, her focus for this part of the trip, more easily pondered than devotion, in an ashram in India, or balance, in quirky Indonesia?
B000002B49|5.0|Just wanted to add my quick two cents regarding this album.  This is the best album from Deep Forest and is one I play regularly.  The mixture of sound and music in this album is really great.  I'm still waiting for Deep Forest to put out another album as good as this one.  None of them have come close.
B000002MIY|4.0|While nominally a Donald Fagen album, this album is the start of the Walter-Becker-as-overall-guitarist-era in his collaboration with Fagen. (Walter is the co-author with Fagen of all original Steely Dan tunes.) As such, this disk lacks the great rhythm and lead guitar work of every previous Steely Dan or Donald Fagen disk. <br /> <br />While this is the most obvious element of the great shift from legendary session players to merely really good ones that happens on Kamakiriad, it is by no means the only one. No Chuck Rainey, Victor Feldman, Bernard Purdie, Joe Sample, etc. <br /> <br />Who cares? Well, Fagen's chord changes are noticeably less refined then on previous work and there are very few compelling instrumental lines lurking in the mix. The net effect is to focus your listening on Fagen's tunes, singing, etc.  <br /> <br />While I think that makes the album much more a personal statement and that's fine. I do, however, miss some of the best studio folks writing great parts, doing great solos or performing what Fagen and Becker ask them to, but in their own special way. <br /> <br />That lack and tunes that I like slightly less on average than Nightfly (which I would rate 5 stars) mean that it's a 4 star disk.
0780624890|5.0|When it comes to action/adventure and comic book style superheroes 'Blade' is one of the classics of the genre. Wesley Snipes is perfect as the anti-hero Blade. Half human, half vampire he is known as Daywalker. Blade possesses all the strengths and none of the weaknesses of other vampires. The rays of the sun have no effect on him, thus the name \\"Daywalker\\" and garlic and silver do not destroy him as they do other vampires. Protector of the human race, he is the most feared enemy of the Vampire Nation.<br /><br />If you love dark superhero type movies and aren't squimish about blood, afterall this is a vampire tale, this is the movie for you.  Wesley is fantastic as is Stephen Dorff as the evil young vampire Deacon Frost. N'Bushe Wright is a nice addition as Dr. Karen Jenson who adds some much needed attractiveness to a very dark film and Udo Kier has a small but impressive role as Vampire Elder Dragonetti. Also suprisingly good role for Kris Kristofferson as Blade's human partner 'Whistler'.
B000E5N62U|3.0|A couple of overall opinions...there are two fine guitarists on this disk: Wayne Krantz and Jon Harrington. For the most part, I much prefer these guys to Walter Becker. \\"Ready Freddy\\" Washington, a legendary bass player, is largely wasted. Nothing on this disk approaches his work with Anita Baker.  <br /> <br />My complaint is that a number of the tunes lack the inventive, harmonically challenging chord progressions that are key to a good Fagen tune. H Gang, Brite Nightgown, It's What I Do are the worst offenders. These would be good pop songs for most writers. Unfortunately, Fagen has to compete with Fagen. <br /> <br />On the other hand, Pagoda of Funn and Night Belongs to Mona have some really nice chord sequences. I am very grateful to have even one more Fagen tune that holds its own against his earlier work. <br /> <br />I consider Fagen's Nightfly to be a 5 star work. Kamakiriad is good but it's no Nightfly and so would rate 4 stars. I don't think Morph is as good a Kamakiriad. <br /> <br />That said, I believe most Fagen fans will want to judge for themselves and will buy this disk or gratefully accept it as a gift. Those who want to start to become fans should start with Nightfly <br /> <br />
B00005JKWJ|4.0|'Blade II' is one of the few exceptions to the rule concerning sequels. This one rivals the first and posits the proverbial question \\"which one is the best?\\" My general rule is the original is always the best, but I accept my choice as subjective opinion and will posit the possibility that I might be wrong.<br /><br />In installment two Blade joins forces with the Vampire Nation to destroy a new strain of the vampire virius which is producing a hybrid creature with a ravenous thirst that hunts both vampires and humans. Now fighting alongside the \\"Blood Pack\\", a group initally put together to hunt down Daywalker, the battle for the survival of both races is about to begin.<br /><br />Positives: More action, more blood. Ron Perlman is amazing as Blood Pack wiseguy 'Reinhardt'. The scenes involving the interaction between Blade and Reinhardt are the best in the movie. Also, the inclusion of Hong Kong martial arts legend Donnie Yen as 'Snowman' was a great move. Unfortunately they killed him off much too early.<br /><br />Negatives: The storyline and dialogue aren't as sharp and cohesive as the first (with the exception of the banter between Blade and Reinhardt). Leonor Varela is good as the vampire princess 'Nyssa', but I would've preferred the return of N'Bushe Wright to reprise her role as Blades' potential love interest Dr. Karen Jenson.
0140177396|3.0|This book is very nice to read because it shows many how people can get along and live with each other for a long time.  I am a student  in High School and I read this book with my sand it was fun to read.  It wasn't hard to read at all but it was more difficult to analyzed.  The characters in this book have very deep meaning and detail that can only be uncovered by actually analyzing it.  This book may seem very boring if you read it from cover to cover without stopping to think about the time period, the characters, and the setting.  I would recommend this book for someone who likes to read about things that were made in the past because it refers to many things of the 1930's.  I enjoyed reading this book and I liked learning about the theme in it.  I would recommend for a teenage audience and up.
B000F0UV0E|3.0|I agree with the Amazon review; this is a tame, no chances taken recording. My God, this is Mark Knopfler, and the guitar work is insipid!
B0009IW88A|3.0|This soundtrack is deffeatly not the best from Hans Zimmers. But His scors are good for the movie, just like it should be. It's dark and powerful, and you can relax when you listen to it. But he has donne better like \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" og \\"The Prince of Egypt\\".
B000002MJ0|5.0|I don't usually take issue with Amazon's editorial reviews, but Roni Sarig makes two big blunders. First, he calls Isn't Anything \\"worthy of Creation [Records]'s 'shoe-gazing' heritage.\\" Before this album, there was no such \\"heritage.\\" This album created such a buzz in the UK, Creation used its producers and sound engineers to make pop bands like Lush and Ride sound as much like this record as possible ... this was the album that set off the shoegazer movement. Despite those efforts, though, no one ever managed to create an album that sounded just like this, not even MBV's follow-up. Second, Sarig and many other reviewers seem to think Isn't Anything is merely a step towards greatness. This album does not have the insane, orchestral density of Loveless, but for that reason it's able to deliver a much wider variety of pleasures. The bass-driven stop-start of \\"Soft as Snow,\\" the relentless guitar attack of \\"Feed Me With Your Kiss,\\" the pairing of quavering tremelo and creepy, childlike vocals of \\"No More Sorry\\" ... each of these tracks is a perfect, unique jewel. You can hear many of the tools Kevin Shields and his band would use to construct Loveless, but in a more spare arrangement that allows you to hear each element much more clearly. Many tracks make dramatic use of silence, something MBV never did later in their career. You can also hear the band flatout rock. You can't call \\"Feed Me,\\" \\"You Never Should\\" or \\"Sueisfine\\" \\"dream pop\\" ... they're pure adrenaline. This is, to be sure, a more conventional rock album than Loveless, but it still sounds like nothing else. If it came out today, we'd be falling all over ourselves to praise it.
B000FIMG68|1.0|The second year of Lost produced some of the worst storylines ever written. Instead of resolving many of the open issues of the first season, new characters and storylines were added. The additional characters or characters with greater roles were terrible.This whole plot line involving the chamber is getting more and more bizare and frankly boring. <br /> <br />The spacing of episodes was horrible. Never new when a new one was on. Weeks of repeats and worse yet repeats of last season. It killed the pacing of the show. I sometimes forgot what had occured because there were new episodes spaced weeks apart.  <br /> <br />A show like Lost needs the same kind of showings like 24 (the best show on TV for many years now), the suspense, intensity and pace of the show keep viewers interested.  <br /> <br />Reviewers who are giving this season 4 stars must have not been viewing the same show as I was. The viewership was down by close to 18% and understandably why. The show was terrible. <br /> <br />I'm hoping that once I view the show again on DVD my opinion might change.  <br /> <br />Hoping season 3 is a lot better
B0000648WZ|5.0|Reading the reviews, you can see who takes it TOO seriously.  Pretty sad considering it FICTION!   <br /> <br />This film has not much to do with the book.  But that's okay.  The film is entertaining.  The bad \\"guys\\" are insects so you can't really sympathize or empathize with BUGS--remember their Bugs, FICTIONAL BUGS.   <br /> <br />We have a future militaristic society--and that's not new--communists do that all the time as have Nazis and radicals of all kinds.  But this movie is FICTION. <br /> <br />It's straightforward.  The humans have been tolerating an ongoing assault by the `Bugs' for an undetermined length of time.  But the `Bugs' go too far.  The Bugs destroy a human city.  And there you have it.  The Bugs started it, and the federal government takes the fight to them, and does so very badly at the start.  From there, we have romance and guns, spaceships and guns, and many humans and guns.  The film ends with the high hope that the human species will win, but hope can be fleeting . . . . <br /> <br />The effects are very good.  The acting is good.  What's wrong with this film is generally the attitude of certain viewers.  Many seem to forget that it's FICTION.  They actually make some kind of socially relevant polemic out of it, and the average movie goer already KNOWS ITS FICTION. <br /> <br />By the way: The Da Vinic Code is fiction too! <br />
0967851408|5.0|This book is well written and to the point. The author does not attempt to cloud any of the processes with dogma or rituals. He in fact explains in very plain language how to create your own world according to your own desires in accordance with your level of discipline in attaining your goals. I for one find this book invaluable in that it is always there to remind that my mind can and does control my actions and my outcomes. I would recommend that everyone read this book.
B00005JOVH|5.0|Scientists have discovered a \\"cure\\" for the mutant gene.  Now, all mutants can choose to become a \\"normal\\" human.  Division rises amongst the mutant community.  Some see this as an opportunity to be something they always wanted to be.  Others, like Magneto (McKellan) see this as an attempt at racial cleansing.  While Professor X (Stewart) sits on the sidelines, Magneto rallies the troops to rise up against the cure and those who are pushing it.  The X-Men must stop Magneto before he causes too much damage, but a former ally has been raised from the ashes of her former self, and she may be the deciding factor in this war.<br /><br />This X-Men movie is the best yet.  Filled with action and an always timely storyline, it does not disappoint.  Story-wise, characters die, return from the dead, lose their powers, and are changed significantly before all is said and done.  This shake-up introduces doubt into who will survive the final battle, and ratchets up the stakes.  Director Brett Ratner is taking over the reins from Bryan Singer, who left this franchise for another (\\"Superman\\").  He proves that he is up to the challenge.  I highly recommend this film.
B000F4LPJ6|5.0|In the near future, high school students are protesting against the school system as the adults begin to worry, thus creating a special program called \\"The Battle Royale Program\\" in which students who are selected at random to an island where they are armed with weapons as they must be seperated to hunt & kill each other one by one until one will remain to become the winner.<br /><br />One of the most controversial movies in recent memory, this wild and ultraviolent Japanese Sci-fi action thriller is inspired by the same infamous novel from it's own country and has shattered Japanese box-office records. It also stirred up some trouble over there on the film's subject matter and on the Japanese politics, the story is a very intriguing futuristic flick with ideas, violence and gore to keep the viewer entertained with some social and political issues.<br /><br />This DVD has terrific picture and sound quality with Japanese audio with English subtitles! There's some quality extras like the trailers, Press Conference on the movie, Special Effects Comparision featurette, Rehearsal footage, TV Spots, behind the scenes footage and more. This movie is a powerful, unique and disturbing epic beyond anything you've ever seen before! this movie must be seen to believed.
B000F6IOC0|4.0|Why can't they all just get along? The Vampires and Werewolves \\"at each others throats\\" for so many generations instead of letting bygones be bygones and teaming up to feed on us mere mortals...I mean...how silly.<br /><br />Well I guess it's a good thing for us though, no? Because without the war there would be no action-packed series thrillers called Underworld and Underworld Evolution. There's suspense, tons of action and a great storyline from the start of the original right through Evolution...which is a bit of a prequel/sequel.<br /><br />All of the key characters are back in Evolution played by the same actors...with the same director. That's the first ingredient to a successful sequel. The main addition is the Vampire Marcus that we saw coming to life briefly at the end of the original.<br /><br />The effects in the original and in Evolution are great. Marcus' flying in Evolution looks a bit more magical than he is actually using his wings, but otherwise the movie is visually spectacular.<br /><br />The series documents a war that has been raging between the Vampires and Lycans for years all because one of the Vampire leaders didn't want his Vampire daughter marrying a Wolfman several centuries back. Flash back to the present and Kate Beckinsale is a Death Dealer/Vampire that hunts the last of the Lycan. Scott Speedman was a mortal in the original that supposedly held the key to end the war, but he unfortunately took some licks (and a couple bites...key words: a couple) protecting that key. Now in Evolution let's just say that he's more like X-Men's Wolverine than mild mannered Michael Corvin. A rift between the Lycans and Death Dealing Vampires is borne in Evolution involving Viktor's brothers, Marcus and Willliam. Hence the saga continues with a sequel that thoroughly entertains.<br /><br />Both the original and Evolution come in a brilliant HD transfer with terrific 5.1 sound.<br /><br />All in all a very well done story that pays to watch from the beginning. Yes, Evolution stands alone. But this is one movie that I believe was not intended for seeing prior to the original. So if you haven't already, you'll want to purchase both Underworld and Underworld Evolution and watch them in order.<br /><br />Definitely worth the purchase getting both movies into your collection. They are keepers for those into the genre.ne movie that I believe was not intended for seeing prior to the original.

B000084T18|5.0|First off some of you people need to relax, i hate when some people give this album 1 star just cause they hate 50 Cent. This is a classic album, its one of the best produced albums of all time, Dr. Dre and Eminem provide crazy beats and with 50's slow seductive flow the album is a knockout. The guest appearances by Eminem, G-Unit and Nate Dogg are amazing. Eminem is on two of the tracks (Patiently Waiting and Don't Push Me)and on both of them he blows his protege' away and Lloyd Banks' verse is sick and i'll put it up against any Biggie or Pac verse. Every track on the CD is good, no fast-foward material here. Compared to other classic debut it does hold its own. Im not gonna lie, lyricly it doesn't match up with Ready to Die, Illmatic, Reasonable Doubt and so on, but 50 does have great lyrics.Between His mesmerizing flow, great lyrics, superb guest appearances and blazing beats all makes for a perfect album <br /> <br />Track Listing and Ratings.... <br /> <br />1.Intro-short but cool  <br />2.What Up Gangsta?- crazy beat with nice lyrics 4/5 <br />3.Patiently Waiting- Perfect song every thing works, one of my favorites 5/5 <br />4.Many Man (Wish Death)-The best song on the album 5/5 <br />5.In Da Club-classic club banger, this song will be around  forever...its always gonna be someones birthday 5/5 <br />6.High All The Time- great beat and I love that he took a shot at nas and jay-z, it showed that he was here to stay 5/5 <br />7.Heat-the intro is cool, it has a creative beat and aggressive lyrics 5/5 <br />8.If I Can't-good song 4/5 <br />9.Blood Hound-Awesome beat and serves it purpose by introducing the world to young buck 4/5 <br />10.Back Down-Great diss on ja rule, 50 is very cocky and has good personal punch lines 5/5 <br />11.P.I.M.P-Great radio song but it does get played out after a few times, the remix with snoop and g-unit is a lot better 3/5 <br />12.Like my Style-just an ok song 3/5 <br />13.Poor lil Rich-insane beat and great lyrics 5/5 <br />14.21Questions-really good song, funny punch lines and a nice hook by nate dogg 4/5 <br />15.Don't Push Me-(the second best song)one of eminem's best beats and 50, banks and eminem all lay down great verses 5/5  <br />16.Gotta to Make it to Heaven-Perfect song, 50 actually sounds tired and short of beath, i also think its crazy that he used the serenity pray in it 5/5 <br />17.Wanksta-Great song, 50's first hit...it will always be a classic 5/5 <br />18.U Not Like Me-some of 50's best lyrics ever 5/5 <br />19.Life On the Line-He sounds hungry, angry and agessive. Great song and it shows what 50 was like before Eminem and Dr. Dre <br /> <br />     It sold 11 million for a reason <br />
B000ESSTKQ|5.0|don't listen to the naysayers. the U.S. reisssue of 'speak and spell' is a more than worthy addition to the dm reissue canon.  chances are you already own 'speak and spell,' as well as it's great b-sides, 'ice machine,' 'i sometimes wish i was dead,' and 'shout,' so i won't get into the album itself.<br /><br />the accompanying dvd is a veritable treasure trove for mode-a-philes, the most shiniest diamond being the interviews with vince clarke.  i don't know much about vince's personal feelings about dm, but if he harbors any grudge, it certainly doesn't show.  and it was nice to hear the man actually speak. it's a nice treat.  it was also so great to hear the stories behind the early mode gigs, how daniel miller first decided to sign the band, how seymour stein flew to basildon to see them live, how they recorded the album, the genesis of the hideous album cover, and the truly embarrassing, but endearing and charming, early live performances on TOTP and other british tv shows.  dave looks like he's about 14 years old. he comes of as shy and naive--a far cry from the dave we'd see but 10 years later. vince seemed in command from the beginning, martin seems confused and fletch, well, he's fletch.<br /><br />as with the violator and masses reissues, the mixing sounds great. i picked up a lot of bells and whistles in the songs i'd previously missed. i only wish they would've included the b-sides on the cd, or as a bonus cd.
B00000G3PA|4.0|Well, I know this movie was crushed by the critics, the movie in many ways you see it is very entretaiment in my opinion has great action sequcens with the same Bay's stile, the acting was OK, visuals are also one the strongest point in this movie obviously with big budget you can do anything you want, the earth looks very realistic and the history of love is very good I always cries with the ending of this movie is very touching,the music is beautiful is touching too,Aerosmith apparently it was inspired by its daughter he  did one the best soundtracks of  a movie  after all is good movie to see on a saturday night with your family, i own the normal edition but i think is too expensive  I like the features don't get my wrong but with the money you save you can buy another movie.
B00003CXA6|5.0|If you see only one multi-hour movie in your life, see this one. The actors (professional or otherwise (eg: civil war re-enactors)) are at their very best.

B00023B1LC|5.0|Bourne Identity is one my favorites action movie ever and one of my favoirtes chacter ,Hollywood must be proud to have a actor like  Matt Damon, he is one the best actor of our time,i have to agree he was awful in The Brothers Grimm but i think that is the only bad movie of him, Matt Damon plays Jason Bourne a CIA assassins who lost his memory and he got to find it and reconstruct its past, the movie is based on a Robert Ludlum bestseller , also there is a great cast like the superab Chris Cooper as  Conklin ,Frank Potente as Marie,Brian Cox as Abbott,Clive Owen as The Profesor and Julia Stiles(by the way the most mediocre actress i ever seen in my life)as Nicky , the history is well done with a lot chasings,action,explosions... must to-have for the any fan of this type of movie, Bourne is a better spy than Sr.Bond(I like but it new Bonds movie aren't so good) and Sr.Hunt,I own the special edition there isn't much diference between the normal edition and special edition definitively a excellent buy.
B00000099Y|5.0|Name an album that you can listen to 10 years album that is just as good as the first time you heard it? Not many.  Aenima stands up as an album that will be just as fresh and just as good in another 10 years.  The album merges the dreamy with the aggressive.  While lots of so called metal bands went for overblown macho bombast, Tool remains with a sound that is heavy, provoking and powerful.  They do it not by doing speed guitar or up from your bowls growls and lame rap; they do it with music that has a real center, a true core.  Maynard has something to say.  Tell me as you listen to this album that it doesn't bear listening to again.<br /><br />Oh, and learn to swim.
B00000IL1K|5.0|Having only discovered the world of classical crossover this year, it wasn't long before Sarah Brightman, the English soprano who crashed the scene with her career defining performance in Llyod Weber's \\"The Phantom Of The Opera,\\" registered under my radar. <br /> <br />I have listened to many of Brightman's albums, from her latest \\"Harem\\" to her other works such as \\"Time To Say Goodbye,\\" \\"La Luna\\" and \\"Dive.\\" I believe that \\"Eden\\" is her best to date, and stands as a collection that anyone, classical fan or no, can enjoy. <br /> <br />A warm, hypnotic, and touching mix of operatic pieces, pop covers and almost electronica inspired beats, I have yet to find another album that matches what Brightman has accomplished. Neither Charlotte Church of Haley Westenra have matched her artistic vision and flawless arrangments, and I doubt they ever will. <br /> <br />Stand out tracks include \\"Eden,\\" \\"Deliver Me\\" \\"Nessun Dorma\\" and \\"Only An Ocean Away.\\" It is here that we see what Eden is truly about, and hear Brightman at the very top of her vocal ability. The rest of the album features many treats as well, though these are the selections I find myself playing over and over again. <br /> <br />In conclusion, I hope you decide to give a more low key genre a try, and I certainly hope you buy this album. I hope that Brightman will produce more albums like Eden in the future, for they truly have the capacity to stand the testiment of time!
0156030306|5.0|Flowers for Algernon is the gripping story of Charly Gordon, a kind-hearted, hard-working man suffering from mental retardation, who opts to participate in an experimental procedure to improve his mental faculties.<br /><br />The operation is successful, and his mental abilities begin to climb. This opens up a world of possibilities for Charly; he develops friendships with the research staff, and even develops a loving relationship. He comes to understand that people he thought were his friends may not have been has friendly as he thought. When crisis falls, Charly has to decide what matters to him, and what defines his identity - is it his newfound intelligence, or the connections that he has made with the people around him?<br /><br />Of particular interest to me (as a writer) is the incredible way in which Daniel Keyes communicates his story to the reader. The story, written in the format of Charly's research journal entries, begins in a mechanically atrocious condition; poor grammar and spelling that is very phonetic - as you would expect from the journal entries of retarded individual. As Charly's mental abilities develop, the mechanics of the text give us a very clear and tangible way of feeling that progress. It is a perfect example of the way that breaking the mechanical rules of writing can sometimes make the writing even better.<br /><br />I highly, highly recommend this book.<br /><br />Danny Iny<br /><br />Author of \\"Ordinary Miracles - Harness the power of writing and get your point across!\\" (ISBN 1-4116-7252-6)
0446677450|4.0|While Robert Kiyosaki has become somewhat of a star as of late, his original book is indeed recommended on the reading lists of anyone looking to get a leg up in terms of how to think when it comes to finance. <br /> <br />With financial literacy being laregly neglected in our school system, many are often left withuot the neccessary tools and mindset to ensure financial success. In these times of both economic turmoil and oppurtunity, Kiyosaki's book couldn't be more relevant. <br /> <br />Putting it mildly, you will never get rich as a 1040 wage earner. The government taxes those wages and the more you make, the more you pay. Consequently, there are other alternatives, such as building an investment portfolio that is not subjected the rules and regulations as your paychecks are--to your benefit. <br /> <br />While Kiyosaki primarily focuses on real estate, other options such as stocks, 401ks, roth RIAs, etc. are also viable options for those just starting out. Savings accounts in banks are never a bad thing, however with such low yields your money would be better well served in an alternative situation. <br /> <br />Kiyosaki does ramble a bit and the book could have used a bit more editing, however it stands as a real eye opener for many (including me) as to how one needs to think in order to achieve financial freedom and prosperity in today's world.  <br /> <br />Highly recommended for those who want to get a leg up, or any young person out there who wants to get more out of life than working for everyone else in the world but yourself.

0385504209|4.0|\\"The Da Vinci Code\\" is not fine literature, and those who wish to read something of a higher literary caliber should look elsewhere. However, if you are looking for page turning entertainment, this novel does the trick.<br /><br />As everyone has heard by now, \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" centers around Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon as he is plunged into the middle of a race against time to discover the mystery as to who murdered Paris art curator Jacques Sauniere in the Louvre, leaving a series of mind boggling clues behind.<br /><br />It is later revealed that the group behind Sauniere's death is Opus Dei, a real-life conservative sect of The Catholic Church, whom say are little more than a cult who seek to brainwash members and influence the world through their wealth and muscle.<br /><br />Of course, the greatest revelation is that Jesus Christ was married to Mary Magdalene (who was not a prostitute) and that they had a family--meaning that to this day there are blood heirs to the Church, a secret that the church will stop at nothing to conceal, for it is they who are the rightful rulers of one of the most powerful entities on Earth.<br /><br />40 million copies sold in the past three years can't be wrong, and \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" certainly lives to the hype in some respects. True, the writing is somewhat pedestrian and the book drags in some places, but this is commercial fiction in its finest form.<br /><br />Recommended for anyone who hasn't seen the movie or read the book, or anyone who is willing to put their own beliefs aside and listen to an alterative viewpoint, one that could possibly have greater ramifications than we could have ever dreamed of!

B000069AUI|5.0|While I own all of Coldplay's albums, \\"A Rush Of Blood To The Head\\" remains my personal favorite. A mix of lush melodies, driving rock beats and Chris Martin's heavenly vocals propelled the British band to fame and notoriety worlwide, and for once, the group deserves their hype. <br /> <br />There are almost too many outstanding tracks to go into detail here, and one must hear the music for themselves to gain an appreciate for it; however wordy I may be, even I cannot do them justice by merely seeking to describe their work. <br /> <br />My personal favorites off the album include \\"Politik,\\" \\"In My Place,\\" \\"The Scientist,\\" and the stunning \\"Clocks,\\" one of the best songs in the history of music as far as I'm concerned. Listening to these tracks, and the album as a whole, transport me to another world entirely, one that I get to visit whenever I need to. <br /> <br />Not that the band needs any help in terms of album sales, but I do hope that you will give them a try if you haven't discovered them already. You will not be disappointed!
B0002EXH5O|5.0|Wow, where do I start, well, Megadeth's leader Dave Mustaine was kicked out of Metallica in 1983, right before Metallica's Kill 'Em All was released. Revenge was the only thing on Dave's mind, so he formed MEGADETH. He made three albums before this. But, Rust in Peace was their best album. And for good reason.    1. Holy Wars...The Punishment Due: 10/10:    Part 1: Holy Wars: 5/5: A breakneck-speed riff starts off RIP. It leads to a Mustaine solo, and a Chinese Style Friedman solo are what shine.    Part 2: The Punishment Due: 5/5: The better of the 5 guitar solos are in this half. A bone shattering riff shows up near the end of the song.    2. Hangar 18: 5/5: This song is the average guitar player's biggest challenge. There are 9 (!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!) guitar solos. Each of them are somewhat short, but each are worthy of renown.     3. Take No Prisoners: 5/5: A nice soul-smashing riff and a thumping bassline keep hold of this somewhat short song. The infamous chorus is what makes this a favorite of many.    4. Five Magics: 5/5: Starting out with a speedy riff and smattering drums, it quiets to bass and drums. Then, it builds up and decimates all softness. The fast thrash riff at the end is accompanied by a heavy-as-hell rhythm line.    5. Poison Was the Cure: 5/5: Starting out with a bass intro, it builds into a guitar riff that sounds more like a repetitive guitar solo. The ending riff reminds me of No Remorse (Kill 'Em All)    6. Lucretia: 4/5: Starting out with an old woman's laugh. (Which gets me every time) It explodes into a crazed song of speed.     7. Tornado of Souls: 5/5: An interesting riff, kind of filler though.    8. Dawn Patrol: 5/5: YEAH! Bass is godly. This song may seem weak, but it is AWESOME.    9. Rust in Peace...Polaris 10/10    Part 1: Rust in Peace: 5/5: Smattering drums start up the song, backed by Mustaine's horror filled vocals. Chorus is VERY catchy.    Part 2: Polaris: 5/5: Sweet! The bassline really stands out here!    EXTRA TRACKS    10. My Creation: 3/5: A couple of good solos, but not realy worthy of shock value. No more than a minute and a half long.    11. Rust in Peace...Polaris (DEMO): 10/10    Part 1: Rust in Peace: Vocals are more raw, which makes the song better.    Part 2: Polaris: Chris Poland solo is really cool, but Marty's is somewhat better.    12. Holy Wars...The Punishment Due (DEMO): 10/10    Part 1: Holy Wars: Faster = Better.    Part 2: The Punishment Due: NOOOOOOOOO! They took out my favorite solos! Still awesome though.    13. Take No Prisoners (DEMO): 5/5: SUH-WEET! Vocals are AWESOME!    RUST IN PEACE ROCKS!    BUY IT NNNNNNNNNOOOOOOOOOOOOWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW!
B000B5XOSO|5.0|I won't hide my bias--this is my absolute favorite addition to the Batman Films. Tim Burton is an absolute genius and I find this work to be among his finest. He effortlessly captured the gothic romanticism that is crucial to Gotham City, and puts other more recent (save for Batman Begins) versions to shame. <br /> <br />Micahel Keaton stars as Bruce Wayne and Batman, an orphaned billionaire who seeks to claim justice on the vermin of his native city. As thugs continue to terrorize Gotham during the holiday season Wayne is surprised at the recent 'coming out' of The Penguin (Danny Devito) into Gotham's societal radar, seeking to find records of his birth parents while keeping his malovolent plans under wraps. <br /> <br />However, in my opinion, Selena Kyle (Michelle Pfeifer) and Catwoman steal the show. Pfeifer gives a wonderful performance as the corporate secretary who is regularly underminded and harassed by her ignortant boss (Christopher Walken). As her transformation into Catwoman is complete her inner frustration comes to the surface and its not before long before she is giving Batman a run for his money. <br /> <br />All three plots are intertwined in a clever fashion, with the final scenes being both action packed and poignant. The film ends  with the promise of future installments, although it wasn't until Batman Begins that we truly get another sequel deserving of a rental or trip to the theater. <br /> <br />In sum, if you are a fan of either Batman or Batman Begins I sincerely hope you will look at this often forgotten installment in the series. This new DVD has restored picture and sound and quite frankly has never looked better!
0143034901|2.0|Predictable, meandering plot that objectifies women.  It's poorly translated as well.  I only finished this book because it was selected by my book club(without my input).  The characters are flat & the melodramatic plot is adolescent at best.
B00005JLEU|5.0|Anime often remains a mysterious artform to many not familiar with it, often thinking that cartoons are merely for children. However, the Japanese have made anime for both adults and children, sometimes combined into one. <br /> <br />While Spritied Away is a children's story at heart, adults will recognize the moral values and life lessons woven into the plot, as the narrative is both emotionally turbulent and ultimately triumphant in its progression. Imagery and symbolism is rampant througout, with the settings, characters and revelations often having deeper meaning than their initial apperances. <br /> <br />The film starts out with a whiny girl named Chihiro moving to her new home with her parents. As they stop at what seems to be an abdandoned theme park, they are pleased to see that it appears to still be in operation. After Chihiro's parents pig out (literally) on the food set out for guests, the theme park's true nature is revealed and Chihiro is plunged into a world that only tbe brilliant mind of Miyasaki could produce. <br /> <br />The theme park is actually a gateway into a Japanese bath house for the spirit world, and a mortal girl like Chihiro is not welcome. After being given a pity job by Zeniba, the witch over ruling the establishment, she seeks to earn her freedom back as well as rescue her parents from certain death in the pig pen. <br /> <br />While adjusting to life at the bath house Chihiro meets a boy about her age who serves as Zeniba's personal assistant of sorts, though his true identity is ultimately what sets the both of them free.  <br /> <br />This film is visually stunning, combining both traditional animation with computer aided graphics. The DVD picture is both pristine and vivid; audio content is much of the same. While the film's running time is over two hours this film went by in what seemed like an instant, fading away like a pleasant dream on a warm summer night towards the end, and we are left with the unpleasant reality of real life--but with the promise of a better tomorrow if we always rememebr to stay true to ourselves.
B000AL730O|5.0|Paul McCartney has been known to create and record great music throughout his forty-plus-year career.  He began his historic reign in 1964 as the guitarist/ vocalist/ songwriter of The Beatles.  They have since been hailed by several critics as the greatest band of all time.  The Beatles disbanded in 1970, leaving all four members flying solo.  Since then, Paul McCartney has endured the most success of the four.  He has announced in numerous interviews that his career has never been about the money or the fame.  Therefore, he is more than a musician; he's a living legend. <br /> <br />\\"Chaos And Creation In the Backyard\\" returns to his Beatles roots wonderfully.  Yet, he finds room to continue evolving as an artist.  With the help of producer Nigel Godrich, most known for his work with Radiohead, this album finds new life in The Beatles's style while finding new ones.  Compared to much of his previous solo work, this album finds him at a more mellow surrounding.  He eliminates his signature rock sound while creating a more pop (with the exception of the hidden track), which works well for the intent.  The various instruments with their melodies throughout the album give it the more enhanced listening experience while not interrupting the main theme.  He's slightly more minimal but not too minimal.  The album efforts earned Paul McCartney five 2005 Grammy nominations, including Album of the Year. <br /> <br />Despite his musical genius, he finds himself doing what he had never done before; he performed most of his own instruments, namely guitar, piano, bass, and percussion.  Though he is most known to perform the guitar and the piano on his album and his stage shows, he proves himself very versatile.  The seemingly simple melodies take a life of their own through the recording.  He makes them more personal.  This new challenge propels him to higher levels as an artist that many never knew.  Vocally, his talents and expressions are on top as always.  Through this album, he assures that this is his solo album and not a Beatles album by vocalizing everything differently than during that era. <br /> <br />Such music quality assures that \\"Chaos And Creation In the Backyard\\" will continue pleasing listeners young and old.  Those looking to taste his musical beginnings should buy this album.
B000FQJAIW|1.0|Wow, this is the most ridiculous release yet from the George Lucas \\"vaults\\".  How is this guy still able to walk the streets after stealing so much money from people for years?  Well it looks like he is now preparing to steal more fellas!  I won't bore you with a detailed review of the discs as many reviews have already described better than I can.  I know exactly what this Lucas mang is thinkin'......\\"Lets see how much money I can possible squeeze out of star wars fans before they catch on to me? I'll package the \\"original movies\\" with the 2004 special editions which everybody has already bought.\\"  \\"Oh and this is the best part, I told everybody that I would never release the originals and the 2004 DVDs were the definitive releases, but hey sometimes you got to lie to make some money.\\"  \\"I will then proceed to release the original movies as a \\"special bonus\\" for a limited time only in sub par quality since these are half finished movies and not my true vision.\\"  \\"If people want a half finished movie I shall not clean these up at all and release this crap and people will buy it.\\" \\"I can use the profits for hmmm I dunno maybe more work editing star wars so I can release another version...again.\\" <br /> <br /> George just needs to get it over with and re-film episodes IV, V, VI so he can have his true vision realized!  It wouldn't surprise me one bit.  I'm sure he can afford it as he has been leeching off his fans for years.  I have never heard of a guy that treated the source of his income so poorly.  This release is only a slap in the face to the fans.  It is the ultimate jerk move releasing them in not the best quality possible.  Let's face it he has never done ANYTHING except Star Wars that is why he feels like he constantly has to try to \\"better\\" it.  But these DVDs are the biggest waste of money I have ever seen.  A true rip off, pure and simple.  Of course they will still be bought, and a few years down the line he will release the originals again, remastered this time, and his money will keep on flowing.  Make no mistake about it, 0 stars, PFTR.
B00007KWHO|3.0|In a perfect world, everyone would own every album by Yes, even the ones, like this one, that don't begin to measure up to their true classics, like _The Yes Album_ and _Close to the Edge_.  To say that an album doesn't measure up to these two is something one can say about 99.9% of any type of music ever released.  _Time and a Word_ would be a four from any other band, but since it is Yes we need to put it down near their more middling efforts.<br /><br />This being said, there are a few classics here.  \\"Then\\" is the only song on here that actually benefits from the otherwise unwieldy orchestra.  The crescendo and decrescendo dynamics put a bunch of welcome spins on the central idea \\"Love is the only answer/ hate is the root of cancer,\\" which in turns sounds exultant and lamentable, depending on what's going on with the music.  The title track is also a minor Yes classic; like \\"Then\\" it is a hippy anthem (Yes hasn't quite made it to their abstract phase yet on this one, which comes with their next album, the breakthrough _Yes Album_).  \\"Sweet Dreams\\" is also sweet like the title track, with Chris Squire's characteristic chugging bass to provide a heavy dose of sturm und drang to the major key proceedings.  The title track and \\"Sweet Dreams\\" remained live mainstays of the band throughout the 70's for good reason.  You can hear live versions on _The Word Is Live_.  There is no live version of \\"Then\\" on that CD set, so you should buy _Time and a Word_ just to hear this pivotal work, which features some of Peter Banks best guitar playing, too.<br /><br />The weaknesses here are noticeable but not fatal.  As I said, the orchestra is often a distraction.  The listener hears Yes reaching for the space themes that would pay off so well for them  on records to come, but with limited success here.  \\"Astral Traveller\\" has almost the same idea as \\"Starship Trooper,\\" but instead of relying on shockingly original composition and mind-bending virtuosity to take the listener into space, the band relies on annoying studio effects, like phaser on the vocals and panning between speakers to suggest space.  It's a noble effort, but one that fails.  Still, it's interesting to hear this one in the context of the evolution of Yes.  It took a year and a new guitarist for them to take the quantum leap to just about the best space song ever recorded (I think ELP's \\"Karn Evil 9\\" is its only true rival), the aforementioned \\"Starship Trooper.\\"  Without the recklessly daring experimental spirit they took to their craft on _Time and a Word_, they would not have catapulted to their soon-to-be status of pretty-much-the-best-rock-band ever.<br /><br />So despite any deprecations you sense from me in this review, you should still own this one, just like any classical connouisseur should own the lesser works by Beethoven or a true jazz fan should own both _A Love Supreme_ AND _Live in Seattle_; it gives you a sense of the levels to the infinite cosmos they created through innovative spirit alone.nto space, the band relies on annoying studio effects, like phaser on the vocals and panning between speakers to suggest space.

B000EGF0B4|5.0|Brokeback Mountain is a unique, brilliant and well acted movie.  I wasn't sure if I would like it, but I found myself loving it.  How could you not.  There was stunning scenery and a fantastic score, amazing script and last but not least, some of the best acting we've seen in many years. <br />After working together on Brokeback Mountain, these two cowboys find more than just a friendship - they find forbidden love.  Their first meeting happend in 1963 where homophobia would have been far worse than it is today.  What follows is a moving story of two men trying to come to grips with their feelings for each other and their family life at home with their wives and children. <br />This is a must see for everyone.  You may not think you'll like it, but you will be blown away.  It's one of the best movies I've seen in such a long time and this was thoroughly enjoyable.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|ok im sorry but those reviews that bash this cd are crazy. the CD isn't bad. toxic, everytime, showdown and shadow are very good songs. the only song that i do not like is early morning. this CD has a different beat and is more dance than the previous Cds. if you truly are a britney spears fan than you will appreciate this cd
1400034779|4.0|Have you ever wanted to do something--a career move, a hobby,a change in your life--and no one thought you could do it? You knew you could. You wanted it badly, but every one around you gave you no support, not your friends nor your family. That would be what Precious Ramotswe encountered in The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency.<br /><br />Highly intelligent and pleasantly plump, Precious lived in Gaborone, the capital city of the African nation of Botswana. Her father had left her a nice inheritance. But what would she do with it? Open a detective agency of course. She has no experience or potential clients, but she has \\"a tiny white van, two desks, two chairs, a telephone, and an old typewriter.\\" And don't forget the secretary.<br /><br />Precious, or Mma Ramotswe as she is referred to, uses her hunches and ends up helping people, sometimes with hilarious results. She does, however, also face dangerous situations with boldness.<br /><br />Life handed Precious Ramotswe a few curve balls. She refuses to feel sorry for herself and does what she wants to do with her life, no matter what her culture dictates. The reader will cheer Precious on and find inspiration from this character's no-nonsense methods.
B00005JNRY|5.0|Cars is the first movie I have gone to a theater to see in a few years. And I have to say,it was worth it. It was just one of the few wholesome family movies that are meant for every age group. Yes,you have to have a little understanding of Larry the Cable Guy,NASCAR,and a few other things to get some of the jokes. But it was just plain funny. The animation was exquisite. Cars is one of those movies that draws you in. I was impressed to be in a theater crowded with smaller children,and not hear a peep out of them. The kids as well as the adults were glued to the screen and had a great time. I can't wait for a DVD version,this is a movie I will watch over and over again.
0062502182|4.0|The Alchemist by Paulo Coelho is just what a person needs when he or she is feeling down about life. This allegory/fairy tale about a shepherd boy who is looking for the meaning of his life is rife with memorable quotes and advice:<br /><br />\\"Tell your heart that the fear of suffering is worse than the suffering itself. And that no heart has ever suffered when it goes in search of its dreams, because every second of the search is a second's encounter with God and with eternity.\\"<br /><br />\\"No matter what he does, every person on earth plays a central role in the history of the world. And normally he doesn't know it.\\"<br /><br />\\"It's the possibility of having a dream come true that makes life interesting.\\"<br /><br />This is a great read for a free afternoon. The Alchemist will lift your spirits and your mood.
B000FFJ85I|4.0|if u like the older punk sounding AFI (anything before sing the sorrow)and u cant stand sing the sorrow because it is too different, u will not like decemberunderground.  if u enjoy sing the sorrow and cant stand AFI's older stuff, u will more then likely enjoy this album.  if u enjoy all of AFI's music, then give this album a listen to, i think u will like it.  me, being a fan of sing the sorrow, and hating their old punk albums, really liked this album.  it just cannot compare to sing the sorrow.  i am glad that they stayed away from their older punk music.  the only thing that i question about this album is davey's screams.  i am not quite sure if i like it yet.  davey has such a wide range with his voice, and adding a new sound to their new album was a great idea.
0156027321|5.0|A fourteen-year-old boy from India finds himself trapped on a lifeboat with an orangutan, a spotted hyena, an zebra, and a Bengal tiger. Sound improbable? Somehow Yann Martel makes the story believable in his award winning book Life of Pi.<br /><br />Most of the book follows the story arc of Pi, the boy, and the tiger; however, sections of the book relate Pi's life growing up in India, and also flash forward to his adult life. The first third of the book devotes itself to exploring Pi's philosophy of life. What he learns as a precocious boy growing up in India helps him survive as he shares a small space with a deadly predator.<br /><br />The craziest part of the book isn't even the boy/tiger/boat scenario. An encounter with a bizarre ecosystem on an island will creep the reader out.<br /><br />I plan to read this book again, underline the good quotes, and study it for symbolism. Pi follows three different major religions. Perhaps his voyage at sea, on a boat in an endless ocean, with a tiger is a metaphor for the feelings of lostness he experiences as he tries to reconcile three different belief systems.<br /><br />Martel manages to create suspense even though early on, the reader knows Pi survives. What isn't known is how or what his condition is as a result of being at sea. Some readers may find scene after scene of being lost at sea monotonous. I found it showed what Pi was feeling.
B000ECX0QU|2.0|It became generally assumed after \\"Torn Curtain\\" and even more so after \\"Topaz\\"  that the great Hitchcock had finally fallen victim to the march of time.  It turns out what he had actually fallen victim to were idiots at Universal Studios who insisted he hop on the \\"evils-of-communism\\" bandwagon.  The results turned out to be exactly what these meddlers deserved.  \\"Topaz\\" is, simply put, a misguided failure on just about every count.  Hitchcock loathed location filming, and this film required extensive location work.  Music had always been an integral part of the Hitchcock \\"recipe\\".  Since he had lost his favorite composer, Bernard Herrmann (again precipitated by studio meddling on \\"Torn Curtain\\") the score was composed by the fine Maurice Jarre who, unfortunately, just didn't seem able to fill Herrmann's shoes.  It is obvious in scene after scene that Hitchcock just didn't give a damn about this film.  And the lesson cost Universal over $4 Million, nearly five times as much as Hitch had spent on \\"Psycho\\" a few years earlier. <br /> <br />The fact that Hitchcock was still fully capable of making a good film was proven when he came roaring back some three years later with the remarkable \\"Frenzy\\" and, a couple of years later, with his valedictory, the lovely \\"Family Plot\\". <br /> <br />\\"Topaz\\" is a slight blemish on a remarkable career.  Nothing more, nothing less.
B000FQJAIW|1.0|I think this has become the George Lucas retirement plan, release a new version of the same film over and over again, Doesnt he have any new ideas? This is something that should have happened before the new trilogy prequels, Has George went over to the dark side? Greed is a dark side trait right? anyways one possitive note on this I am glad they are coming out which will complete my set once again, and I can get rid of the special editions which in my mind left me empty as did most of the prequels. so rule to starting filmmakers never make $ your art will fail, or you will have one product that will fund your career, ever wonder if Star Wars wouldnt have been finished? This was discussed on the Star Wars Empire movie no not Part 5, Well I can rant and rant and so can you but we will probally get these sets then the garage sale the special additions. Keep our widescreen tapes, and our laser disks and put us back when we first were dazzled by the star wars  trilogy not bewildered and amazed of George Lucas antics and hypocracy. Where is the creativity in Hollywood gone , I think the independent filmmakers have it right, new ideas and better thinking when it comes to releasing a film, knowing what the fans of them like and not trying to railroad them into buying another set. thats it for me you guys can continue, btw I do agree with most of what has been said before me :)
B00005OWIU|3.0|I have been a John Williams fan for some time now.  Since his music in Star Wars, E.T., Jaws and Indiana Jones grabbed my ears and my attention, I have followed the music where ever it played.  When he did Harry Potter though, I was a little disappointed. Don't get me wrong, John Williams is incredibly talented in movie scores, but the first Harry Potter he slipped a bit.<br /><br />John used to be able to make music so when you listen to it you can visualize the scene.  In this CD you can't for some of the tracks.<br /><br />Besides that small thing, I would recommend this to any fan of John Williams or any soundtrack lover.  In the end Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone-Soundtrack gets 3 Stars out of 5.<br /><br />My name is Amone. Adios!
0060763280|1.0|This book is garbage, and I have read it several times, and guess what, I am not broke, and never have been. Live within your means. Save consistently, and do not run up your credit cards, always pay them off monthly. I also attended the full three day event, and found if very boring as I never thought negatively about money.  <br /> <br />Eker has refers to himself as a financial evangelist as someone may have once. If you disagree with him, he shouts you are broke. I was hoping to hear him talk about the financial market, stocks, bonds, options,and futures. All he rages on about is getting you to sign up for his \\"discounted\\" courses so that you feel good about yourself. A true financial course would be 100 times more helpful to anyone that has attended his courses. <br /> <br />Now, if you are in debt, it is a wake up call for those it applies to, but to put down anyone if you do not agree with his way, is crude of him. Thankfully, I am attending college for a MBA, and could fully live without a job for a year off of my hard earned and saved cash reserve.  <br /> <br />Not everyone attending his MMI course is negative about money, and I have proven myself by living what he states. Get a financial education. I suggest the WSJ or NY Times. I have passive income, and surround myself with educated business people and others to look up to. Eker is not one of them.  <br />Please save your money, and do not buy this book. You can get get a basic budget from sources online if you do not have one yourself.  <br />I suggest The Millionaire Next Door by Thomas J. Stanley as it has more practical advice. It is very simple, do not overspend, do not live a life you cannot afford to pay for.
B00005JGAB|5.0|When this debut album by the RAMONES came out in 1976, it was perhaps the most revolutionary rock album since the BEATLES White Album.  It was certainly the most original and influential album of the late 1970's and possibly more so than anything that has been released since then. <br /> <br />Some might be skeptical of my first paragraph, until you realize that the RAMONES (and this album) didn't just introduce the no-holds barred, autobahn fast, three chord punk rock genre to the world; but the RAMONES also influenced the creation of new branches of heavy metal - namely, speed and thrash metal.   <br /> <br />And their influence didn't just stop there:  In the early and mid-80's us goths were into bands like Depeche Mode, the Smiths, Joy Division, The Cure, Bauhaus, Love and Rockets, etc....all of us ALSO wore RAMONES shirts, we loved the Ramones, and we still do.  Robert Smith of the Cure and Martin Gore of Depeche Mode have both worn RAMONES shirts onstage and cite them as influences.  This is in no small part due to their lyrics being so dark and reflective of teen alienation with society.  The sadly deceased Johnny Ramone would probably roll over in his grave if he knew that he and his band were being lumped into the same category with those goth bands that I just named....but...sorry Johnny, your band will always be one of our favorites. <br /> <br />Is this a \\"heavy metal\\" album (or band) as some reviewers below say?  Well, I remember that they opened for Black Sabbath back in the 70's not long after this album came out.  After a few minutes, the audience of metal hippies threw bottles and other trash at the Ramones, and ran them off the stage.  Apparently, metal fans at that time were partial to these slow, drawn out, twenty minute songs with the long wanky guitar solos.  The Ramones (whose songs on this album all clocked in under three minutes, and around only two) didn't buy into this, so the Ramones musical style as opposed to the heavy metal of the 70'swas much different (though, again, they would influence many later heavy metal genres and bands....metal bands like Motorhead, Slayer, Metallica, Guns N Roses, Anthrax, and many other bands cite the Ramones as huge influences).  <br /> <br />So, the Ramones \\"metal?\\"  Well, all I can say is that if it floats your boat then call them what you want...hell, if calling the Ramones a metal band will make you like the band and buy their albums (esp. this one), then you can call em' a polka band, a jazz band, whatever for all I care.  Just buy this record, you won't regret it. <br /> <br />My personal opinion?  The Ramones not only hold the patent on punk rock, they were punk rock back in the days when \\"punk\\" meant something more than overpriced Hot Topic shirts from the shopping mall or car pool rides to Good Charlotte concerts with your mom and little sister.  Oy Vay.  Enjoy this album. <br /> <br />
B00095MLGC|5.0|Like any other PT album, this is exactly that... an album.  Its not a collection of songs with filler but, rather, a well thought out album which lives and flows from song to song.    Any project from Steven Wilson incorporates the use of layering.  Theres a lot of stuff going on in any one of these songs.  And to hear it all on one listen would be near impossible.    Steven Wilson has mentioned himself that he doesn't typically make the most complex music, instead he makes simple songs with complex production.    Listen to Burning Sky for a good example of this.    Think of this as sort of pink floyd and spacey pop opera.  There are quite a bit of instrumentals, so if you're coming from a pop background then i would recommend trying their newer stuff first: \\"Deadwing\\", \\"In Absentia\\", \\"Lightbulb Sun\\", or the newly reissued \\"Stupid Dream\\"    Great stuff. Great journey.

I suggest everyone who hasn't done so and wants these movies the way they should be, just do the same.  <br /> <br />You'll save money and you'll be able to sleep at night knowing that you haven't sent your money to Lucas again... <br />enough is enough....
076790382X|4.0|I have recently been on something of a Bill Bryson binge.  After having read The Mother Tongue and Short History of Nearly Everything, which are two of his more scholarly-oriented books, I decided to try this book (perhaps it should be noted that I have yet to read A Walk in the Woods; this title just appealed to me more).  The stories are often clever, and despite his complaining Bryson rarely, if ever, leaves the threshold of good intentions.  You have to realize that he is a reasonable man, and some of these irrational rants are merely for entertainment's sake and should not be analyzed too closely. That said, I agree with the editorial review in that sometimes he enters Dave Barry-like hyperbole, something that I personally find cheap and overdone, although Dave Barry sells lots of books, so many people must think that style is funny.  Personally, the more subtle humor, such as the little pet names for his wife he inserts in what are supposedly transcripts of actual conversations with her, that amuses me, as well as his joyful musings on American life.  Sure, this isn't too profound, but it manages to be intelligent and critical, while maintaining a whimsical air.  I can just picture ol' Bill with a content smirk on his face while writing these articles in his house in Hanover.  To sum it all up, Bill Bryson seems like the kind of guy I would love to have over for dinner, assuming he is as entertaining in person as he is in this book.
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|This album was definitly a great one. I think after a dissapponting Steal This Album, they needed something to go extremely well, which they did. Mezmerize had some weak points, but not many...such as the songs Sad Statue, and Violent Pornography. I think they just added Sad Statue on the album to make it longer, and didn't even take their time in making the song. Then Violent Pornography is just plain stupid and the lyrics are horrible. But other than those errors, the album was true art. Here's a list of the songs and their ratings recieved by me.<br /><br />Soldier Side Intro - too short, 7/10<br /><br />BYOB - amazing and a top hit - 10/10<br /><br />Revenga - heavy guitaring and then melody strikes - 10/10<br /><br />Cigaro - humorous but kind of pointless - 8/10<br /><br />Radio/Video - awesome vocals and repetitive - 10/10<br /><br />This Cocaine... - pretty bouncy but too short - 9/10<br /><br />Violent Pornography - completely stupid - 2/10<br /><br />Question! - the best track on here - 20/10<br /><br />Sad Statue - bad sound and needs work - 3/10<br /><br />Old School Hollywood - cool sound - 10/10<br /><br />Lost in Hollywood - Daron's only outstanding song - 10/10<br /><br />So after these ratings i tell you that this album is absolutely worth buying and a good one to start with if your just becoming a fan.
B000007T1M|3.0|System of a Down's very first album. Honestly, this album is my all-time least favorite. It was definitly bad, just because of the horrible sound and of some stupidity in songs. Also, some lyrics needed major work, and even the great Serj's voice was bad in one song. Of course, this album does have a few strong points as well, and i will mention them in this list below.<br /><br />My Ratings:<br /><br />1. Suite-Pee - Starts off good but turns to profanity's side during the middle and finishes off bad. 6/10<br /><br />2. Know - Probably the second-best song on the cd. Awesome guitar riffing and kind of strange lyrics. 10/10<br /><br />3. Sugar - This song is well-known and everyone seemes to like it. But i don't. It just sounds like pure crap. 6/10<br /><br />4. Suggestions - Absolute worst song SOAD has ever made! EVERYTHING IS TERRIBLE ABOUT IT, even the acoustic. 0/10<br /><br />5. Spiders - Melodious song with some shouting in vetween parts. All in all, pretty good. 9/10<br /><br />6. Ddevil - There are two words to describe this song. Noisy and Stupid. 2/10<br /><br />7. Soil - Best song on the cd even though it is just mainly yelling and heavy riffing. 10/10<br /><br />8. War? - Another awesome song with a fast pace at the beginning. but then it just turns into Serj talking?!! Why?! That's the only downer about this one. 8/10<br /><br />9. Mind - Wierdest song made by them. It starts off all slow and with the bass, and then progresses into electric guitar and screaming. 8/10<br /><br />10. Peephole - Strange, strange, strange. Well it's basically about getting high, and contains messed-up lyrics. But it is a bit humorous. 8/10<br /><br />11. CUBErt - The same as Ddevil. 2/10<br /><br />12. Darts - Cool song. This is probably the best song that i can tolerate the weird scream that Serj has mastered. 10/10<br /><br />13. PLUCK - I used to love this song but now that i've heard it millions of times, i'm kind of over it. It still is a great song though, with high-pitched shouting and electric guitar in every measure. 10/10reat song though, with high-pitched shouting and electric guitar in every measure. 10/10 <br /> <br />
B00005JOVH|5.0|This was a well-done movie. It was slightly better than the first, but not as good as the second. This one was all about the cure developed to turn mutants into humans, and how the war ended finally. The war was definitely the best part. The dumb part is that Magneto and Charles regain their powers at in the last scenes. They get boring as good and bad guys. But the special effects were absolutely amazing! This, overall, would be agreat movie to buy when it comes out sometime in October.
B0000BWVCM|5.0|I have to say that this x-men was no-doubt the best of the trilogy. It lacked action but everything else was perfect. I noticed Cyclops didn;t have a major role in this one, nor the third. Maybe he hated the job? Who would? But there isn't a lot to say or describe without using the word, awesome. This is no joke. Pick this movie up in stores whenever you can, because it's worth it.
B000E0OBK6|1.0|Had to be the worst movie I ever seen.I got so mad for paying $7.75 cents to see this nothing movie.It was such a let down on our poor men fighting and getting killed In Iraq.To see how these Marines never fought or did they? If this is how our men are trained to fight In a war if there was one. God blesss them I did not see any war or fighting only angry soldiers finally firing their guns in the sky.Fighting was mostly between our men for being send over there.This movie suc-ed BIG TIME
B000F48CD8|5.0|When I first heard Steady as She Goes I wasn't sure I liked it and It's not my favorite but now that I've heard the CD a few times I love it and I like it more everytime I hear it. And I mean the entire CD.
B000F7OMZ2|4.0|Some movies in this world are so bad they're actually good. \\"Attack of the Killer Tomatoes\\" is definitely an example.  <br /> <br />This movie is certainly no match for its predecessor, the very serious \\"Raiders of the Lost Arc\\", but it is so hilarious it deserves 4 stars.  <br /> <br />Will Indiana Jones stop the bad guys? <br /> <br />Will Kate Capshaw stop complaining for 5 minutes?
B000FQJAIW|3.0|Returning to the first Star Wars movie after some 25 years was a moving experience.At the time,it prompted an obsession and sense of awe that lasted atleast two years (i was about eight at the time)...with the passing of time,i was surprised how fascinating the Robots,special effects (in the days before hollow computerized manipulations)and location filming in Morocco (?) remain.I was charmed by all of this,and the baddies have a genuine sense of terror.In the acting department,Peter Cushing (not unlike Goebbels)is particularly convinicing,no doubt aided by the palpable sense of discomfort having to deliver the dismal script. <br />However,even by the standards of light entertainment,the story telling is pretty cluttered and the acting(a few notable exceptions)from the balsa wood school of dramatic art. <br />Whatever the case may be,the initial installment of star wars is an unqualified masterpiece compared to the miserable episode i saw a year or two back.
0385491026|5.0|This novel is about a little girl, Elaine Risley and her adult counterpart also Elaine Risley.  It follows Elaine through a series of events that form her into a painter, and an adult.  It isn't a light read, and it definitely isn't a happy one, but the complexity of it creates a map of pain, bitterness, and self-awareness that reverberates through every page.<br /><br />I love the time-line shifts and the individuality of the narrator.  She's so alone through the entire novel; her thoughts almost become your thoughts as you read her path through life.<br /><br />The typical relationships that most authors would develop through a novel don't really appear here.  Atwood really focuses on the meat of relationships, the actual formation of adults through interaction rather than the interaction itself.  It points out feelings in response to events rather than events themselves: the reaction to a mean and spiteful little girl who breaks down another's self-esteem, a daughter's response to the mother who watches the daughter becomes a stranger, the memories of a lover who matters at the time of love, but who fades to black when the curtain is closed.<br /><br />Atwood really has a gift for allowing a reader to see through another's eyes, and shows what real life is really about.  There is sex, love and friendship, which we humans thrive on, but Atwood has really made a name for herself delving deeper into what makes a real person tick, she sees the truth:  There is no happily ever after.<br /><br />With her barely there humor and her dark sense of life, the irony in most Margaret Atwood novels is like nothing else out there right now.  I have probably 90% of her work and she really has gotten better with age.  It's interesting to me how her work has evolved through the past few decades.  This is my favorite piece.  I would recommend this to anyone who is fiercely intelligent and enjoys something interesting rather that sweet.  There is truth here, nothing is sugar coated.  If fairies and bunnies are your things, I would steer clear from this one.are your things, I would steer clear from this one.
B000001DQI|4.0|Anybody still read ROLLING STONE?? Remember when it was good??!! Now,obviously,I am speaking to my generation here. You know, the days when you could read great writers such as Cameron Crowe,Jon Landau,Steve Pond, and occasionally, Lester Bangs?? I can still remember their review of this album, and the writer just shredded it. No,it wasn't any of the named above.Anyway,this is a fine album.While not on the scale of Tumbleweed Connection, this is still vintage Elton John.However, this is about where he peaked, and for Me, his songs were never quite the same,after.Incidentally, an afterthought about RS-it is a shame that Jann Wenner turned it into a teen slicked, advertising choked, mess.
B0007QJ1MK|5.0|I have to say that this album has grown on me.  I bought this album because I thought it would be as good as Songs for the Deaf.  I have come to a realization.  Good bands are always expanding their musical horizons.  QOTSA are no different.  Even after two members leave the group, the band is able to keep producing some timeless stuff.  This album is different than the other albums.  As always, their music can be as precise as a pin prick or as diluted as mud.  The album starts off very slow, an acoustic tune, then gets moving at breakneck speed , only to slow down slightly and then to push it back up to closed casket speed, and then it ends perfectly.  I will say that Lullabies to Paralyze seems to be a more refined expierience that what I was accustomed to hearing from this band.  Its ever so naughty, a little hurt, and oh so carnal.  This is what rock should be.  No song on this album is the same, there is always a defined difference in the music.  Songs about the power of women over men, songs about the percieved difference in the male and female mind, rationality vs. emotional guidance.  I will say, that one thing that absolutely rocks about this band is their ability to come up with ruthless lyrics that would put a professional poet to shame.  Guest musicians flood to this band like moths to a flood light.  Billy Gibbons from ZZ Top makes a guest appearance, and the former drummer of Danzig, Joey Castillo plays drums on the album.  Overall this album rocks as all their other albums have, it just seems to have a more defined style to itself.  Dont put this album in expecting to become an instant QOTSA fan, this one takes time to appreciate how good the music is.
B00005RHGK|3.0|not bad i mean don't really have much to say its one of those horror films but an ok watch
B00006F83Y|5.0|This was the first QOTSA album that I purchased.  Ever since then I have respected and envied Josh Homme's musical talent.  I'm not the only one either, musicians like Dave Grohl and Nick Oliveri have chosen to participate on his albums.  Everything about Songs for the Deaf is appealing to me.  The whole album consistently rocks, yet the songs dont sound anywhere near the same.  Every track played is a new journey into rock.  This album is so well rounded and so technically precise, but at the same time if distortion is called for, you will get an ear full of it.  When Dave grohl joined the band for this album, it automatically infused a soon to be legendary musician into its ranks.  One might think that his drum work would overshadow the rest of the band, but that is not the case.  On every song Dave Grohl is able to play to the best of his ability and he is met every step of the way by musicians who are just as talented.  But the album is not about individual musicians, it is about the music.  The album starts off making you feel like your about to be fed the same old corporate pushed [...] and then you find out that you are listening to the opposite.  The tracks range from metal all the way over to smooth acoustic songs that make everybody get quiet and enjoy the slight moments of calm.  Then your right back in the fire with songs that remind you of trouble making and super cool individuality.  This albm is made for those individuals who are tired of corporate music and the banks who push it.  If your not ready to rock, dont get anywhere near this album.  But if you want to feel like all hope is not lost for true rock and roll, do yourself a favor and get this album, you wont be disappointed.
0783230370|4.0|OH HOW I WISH THIS WAS HOW IT IS maybe then some men would be more caring through the whole 9 months (i sound a little bitter i know it helps while pregnant...)<br /><br />But anyway good fun good laughs and just one of those movie you can pop in now and then
0783232039|5.0|Chucky's back but now he's got a girlfriend & him and his girl go killing in style.  <br />This is a pretty cool movie all the same although it doesn't have the same charm and horror of the first 3 this movie is still pretty fun and definitely worth the watch and also with a surprise but yet expected ending.
6305364648|4.0|Love it action pack with tom's humor great and i think bill paxton's character was just too much lol...good for the collection
079284131X|5.0|This movie was made nearly 17 years ago and still manages to make me jump. The idea of having a serial killer come back to life in the body of a doll is great. Even the knife wielding antics of Chucky (The Doll) are excellent. The special effects are quite good for their time and strangely enough are quite believeable. Just dont turn the lights off and watch this movie or you will be looking over your shoulder for days watching out for your teddy bear with a knife in its hand. All in all the movie is fantastic. Just a pity all the sequels were not as good as the original although I havnt seen \\"Seed of Chucky\\" yet. ENJOY....
0767834739|3.0|thought its ok slipt in the middle about it, it had its moment of good scenes but i have seen worst when they are doing sequels
0385338694|4.0|I  bought this book off of the bargain table...I was wonderfully surprised...it is a great quick and easy read.  I couldn't put it down.  If you like \\"chick books\\" this one is for you!
6304779356|5.0|I first saw this movie when I was younger. Now I'm a little older, and enjoy watching it just as much. The cast is great, and the make-up in this movie is great as well. The scene where the vampire gang breaks up an unsuspecting party, then feeds off of them, is a total bloodbath! A great scene for gore fans.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|Stadium Arcadium is simply amazing.Something that caught my attenion about the red hot chili peppers are that i never get tired of their songs, on stadium arcadium you have John Frusciante's guitar riffs that could inspire someone to learn to play the guitar, also Chad Smith's drums that could make you go crazy, Flea's trademark slapping bass, and Anthony Kiedis with his vocals. I like the whole album, if hillel slovak was still alive and he was on the album he could of probably put some more funk into the album.
B0000A98ZP|5.0|Following the same nostalgic flair as the old Degrassi series, this is the only movie I've seen that shows REAL high school life - behind the fun and playfulness is a suprising amount of gritty truthfulness, proving in the end that whether you thought you were below or above others, everyone is on the same line. There's no reason for anyone to NOT watch it.
0807126063|5.0|Just remember, the people who have claimed that this book is not worth reading are probably the same people who love davinci code and feel that it warrants scholastic conversation. <br /> <br />To those who think that the comedic events in this book are commonplace and can be seen on any current sitcom, you are correct.  Most sitcoms have reused formulaic situations to little entertainment (think any Friends episode).  But remember, this book was written in the 1960s, long before Pop Culture overused every single theme available. <br /> <br />Dunces is a book well worth the read.  The characters may not have a redeemable value, but they certainly have depth and development.  Toole was clearly not attempting to portray a correct way of living or thinking.  Instead he was most likely satirizing the opposite.  What he did succeed in was writing a book of both literary and entertaining value, painting an interesting and enlightening picture of a lively time and culture.
B000F6IOC0|3.0|I was prepared to give Underworld: Evolution a four or five star rating, because I believe that Underworld is a very unique film.  However I find I cannot do that with Underworld Evolution.  The first film had a small budget, a unique look, in a very interesting take on vampires, and werewolves. <br /> <br />However, I feel that Underworld Evolution went for special effects, action, and CGI, at the expense of story.  They went for cheap thrills, and a slick look at the expense of Selene's, and Michael's story. <br /> <br />This is yet another example of a movie spending money on special effects, just because they can.  If this were the first movie, a sequel never would've been made.  This is because it wouldn't have sustained interest, because of its predictable storyline, and not being able to decide whether it is a period piece or it takes place in the modern world.  Therefore, it tries to do both, and as a consequence of this; the movie doesn't spend enough time in either. <br /> <br />I rate the second installment of Underworld as just an okay film.  It's good enough to watch with a bag of popcorn.  However, it is nowhere as unique as the first installment.   <br /> <br />Kate Beckinsale, and Scott Speedman are fine as Selene, and Michael.  Sir Derek Jacobi is great, as Alexander Corvinus.  That's one good thing they did with the script.  However, Kate Beckinsale should tell her husband Len Wiseman to spend more time on the script with his writing partner, and less time worrying about the special effects. <br /> <br />In fact, this movie is so predictable that I can probably give you the next title in the series.  Underworld: The Rebirth, the plot would be this Selene and Michael start a family, Selene has a boy and girl, and it becomes Michael and Selene's family, against Selene's former coven, and the rest of the Lycan's. <br /> <br />Mr.  Wiseman if you are reading this, and you use my title, I would at least like a little credit.  Also, try not to use special effects, which so closely resemble Raiders of the Lost Ark.
B000FIMG68|5.0|There has been a lot of talk that Lost has begun its long, awkward leap over the \\"Dharma Shark\\" of TV oblivion.  Don't believe it. <br /> <br />I, like others here, did not see season 1 of Lost until it was on DVD.  With the help of this medium, I was able to keep track of the story, the characters, and the various conspiracies of the show without having to wait weeks for reruns to finish and to see those damn car commercials over and over again.  I am convinced that DVD is the only true way to appreciate this show.   <br /> <br />What Season 2 attempted to do was to open up the mysteries of the island while still developing the storylines of each character, and in that the writers did a remarkable job.  As the episodes go on it must be difficult for even the writers to keep track of the whole story.  The past must match up with the present, which ultimately must match up with the future.  Anyone who thinks that there is no great plan among the creators of this show to have a true, sensible ending (unlike the X-Files) is not watching carefully enough.  It bothers me when people complain that certain questions have not been answered yet.  This is a show where I am sure that true PATIENCE will be rewarded. <br /> <br />As for the cast, the season 1 actors are still great.  Of all of them, Locke is the most 3-dimensional of the characters.  Charlie didn't have much to do this season, and Michael became a person to truly dislike, which I'm sure was intentional.  As for the \\"tailies,\\" everyone talks about how Michelle Rodriguez was a bad choice for Ana Lucia.  In this, I agree.  Her character was annoying, not particularly interesting, and not very well acted.  It is unfortunate that she marred the show, but she was important for moving along some plotlines and we did get to cheer a little bit when she died, at least. <br /> <br />And a quick hurrah for Henry Gayle!  The actor who played this \\"Other\\" did so with such finesse and terrifying energy.  As a bad guy (or a good guy?) he was fantastic.   <br /> <br />Overall, a wonderful season full of mystery and intrigue.  I just hope that as the universe of this show gets bigger (the fake websites, the novels \\"written\\" by the author in the plane crash), that it doesn't collapse on itself.  Keep it up, Lost.  We're watching.
1903931843|4.0|Beware! This is not a book for the faint-hearted. The girl's adventures here are definitely not of the timid kind. There are no prim school outings, no tales of sluggish first dates. Instead it starts of as tantalisingly as a roller coaster ride ... on  a tube actually ... locking you into an erotic encounter and lifting you up to a frenzy of sexual delight, as young Greta discovers that what she wants most of all in the world is not what she wants but rather to be told what she wants. And Richard who picks her up on the tube is definitely the man for the job, and the man who can find her other men to satisfy Greta's needs which seem to grow every bit as quickly as every man's desire for her. So this roller coaster does merely click upwards and then plunge down, it cleverly continue to climb, and to climb and to climb, through a series of increasily astonishing sexual manoeuvres. And the amazing thing is that author Chloe, who is obviously a girl who has enjoyed a few adventures herself in her time, is written in a delicate, artiful way that is not only convicing but pantingly stimulating as well. You may need a dictionary at times to follow every nuance, but you will also need  a towel or two to wipe away the sweat.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Don't let Fox's early cancellation fool you. Firefly was, for a glorious half-season, the brightest star in a gloomy TV galaxy. Unlike so much sci-fi, it was human, meaningful, and accessible. It's also easy to see why some people didn't get it. The line between good and evil are more than a little indistinct, which an America still smarting from 9/11 may have had little taste for. The setting of the show is such a melange of old, new, and futuristic places, items, and dialogue that it's hard to figure out what kind of show you're even watching at first. With a little patience, however, Firefly reveals itself as one of the funniest and most exciting shows on TV.     The show follows a crew of space pirates and their passengers as they take a wide variety of often illegal and always dangerous jobs. Among their passengers are a couple of siblings who are fugitives from the Alliance, a totalitarian bureaucracy. Between narrow escapes from the Alliance, the crew encounter sadistic criminal bosses, the cannibalistic Reavers, lethal seductresses, and other colorful characters. No matter how dark the situation (there seem to be plenty of really painful ways to die in space), Firefly handles its plots with lightness and humor. The writing sparkles with Western slang, with a touch of Chinese cussing thrown in for fun effect.     A close reading of the show also demonstrates a surprising amount of depth as well. Despite having so much action and comedy crammed into each episode, a distinct agenda is hidden between the lines. Firefly tells totalitarianism to [...] out, whether government, religion, or stuck-up high society is its agent. Good and evil are fluid, and though our heroes may not be virtuous or even likable all the time, we come away with a greater understanding of why they do the things they do. In the end, the message amounts to a mere \\"Don't judge\\", but the skill with which it is handled makes it stronger than it can be rendered on the page - another good reasonto see the show.    The cast is uniformly excellent. In particular, Nathan Fillion shines as the captain of the spaceship Serenity. He delivers his one-liners with deadly accuracy and handles his action scenes with force and physicality. Alan Tudyk proves endearing as the goofy pilot, and Adam Baldwin is appropriately menacing as the ship's deadliest mercenary (whose loyalties are in doubt). Really, Firefly's cast is an ensemble, who seem genuinely at ease with their characters and generate remarkable energy between one another.     Episode highlights include the original pilot, Serenity, which introduces everything you need to know to understand the rest of the show and the movie. Also check out Our Mrs. Reynolds, War Stories, and Objects in Space. Really, every episode in this regrettably short-lived series is thrilling and worthwhile. Strongly recommended.
1931559317|5.0|Finally!! A PERFECT atlas for amateurs with small or medium sized scopes (up to 8\\"), binoculars, or naked eye. Sky and Telescope has really outdone themselves with this one. It looks like they have really taken all of the comments about SkyAtlas 2000.0 into heart when designing.  Constellation lines, good scale, telrad finder circles, very good index, etc. Pages are nice and heavy and take pencil and erasing really well.  <br />Don't be intimitated by the fact that there are 80 charts.  The layout makes sense, and it won't be long before you memorize your favorite constellations.  <br />GET THIS!!!  <br />
B000002VCU|4.0|Looking back now, most Alan Parsons Project fans don't care too much for their 1979 release \\"Eve\\".  It's easy to say why.  The music and lyrics are both a bit cold and harsh.  This is what makes The Turn of a Friendly Card an even more welcome record.  The lush orchestration and overall flow from song to song harken back to I Robot.  This trend would fortunately continue on their next (and possibly strongest) release. <br /> <br />The big hit from this album, \\"Time\\", is probably one of the weaker tracks on this album, which isn't a bad thing to say.  It's just that every track here has its place in the concept and all are arranged and performed brilliantly with Time being the only exception.  It doesn't fit into the gambling genre per-se, and it's actually a bit saccharin for my taste. <br /> <br />I would easily rate this album right up there with Alan Parsons Project's best works, including I Robot and Eye In The Sky.  This album occasionally gets overlooked, but with great tunes like \\"May Be A Price To Pay\\" and the entire Turn Of A Friendly Card suite, this album far outdoes either of their previous two releases. <br /> <br />If you only had this one APP album in your collection, you'd be in pretty good shape.  I would have rated this 5 stars if it weren't for \\"Time\\", but 4 is a bit unfair.  I still listen to this after all these years, which is always a testament to the staying power of great music.
B00005JO1R|4.0|I don't know anything at all about Johnny Cash - save for that 'Hurt' and 'Tennessee Stud' are two of my favourite songs, full stop - and so I didn't have any checkboxes to tick or things I really wanted to see done right in \\"Walk The Line\\".    What I saw was a movie that's certainly restored some of my faith in big-budget Hollywood pictures, a 2-hour-plus treasure that manages to be insightful, entertaining and - most importantly - real.    The two central performances given by Joaquin Phienix as Cash and Reece Witherspoon as June Carter are runaway successes: each actor, in very different ways, bring individual and plausible life to their characters - no mean feat, when you consider that these characters aren't simple fiction. Their onscreen chemistry is palpable and, jaded old movie watcher that I am, I found myself instantly accepting the bond that Phoenix and Witherspoon portray together. Surprisingly, the vocals are all theirs, too (thankfully! with a vocal style as distinctive and unmistakable as that of Johnny Cash, it would have been stupid to attempt to lip-synch, in my opinion), and here more praise must be heaped on the pair - not only can they sing these songs, they perform them with real spirit and energy.    Another cast highlight is Robert Patrick as Ray Cash, giving an excellent performance as the nasty daddy - perhaps the only flaw of the movie's script is that it does not allow for much development of characters like Ray Cash or Vivian - but Patrick and Ginnifer Goodwin, insofar as they're able, don't allow their small parts to become two-dimensional, so it's not all bad news.    Direction is great - James Mangold displays a real sense of affinity with the music hall style of C&W performance and, as with the rest of the picture, this comes across as a believable, plausible style. Musical numbers are kept nicely and wisely understated and the whole look and feel of the movie is very pared-back, but all the more rewarding because of this.    All inall, this is an excellent character study: two amazing performances from the leads mean that a simplistic plot of boy-meets-girl-and-must-overcome-personal-demons-in-order-to-get-girl is showcased in a beautiful, satisfying and very real way.    Wholly recommended. And I just went and bough my first ever Johnny Cash album, too!
0393316041|4.0|I can't really add much to the hundreds of reviews already posted but to say one thing in response to a common criticism I've read.  Many have criticized this book for its poor writing style.  This would be a valid critique - if Feynman had actually sat down and written it.  Nearly the entire book is transcript from a series of taped conversations between Feynman and a friend, and the effect is  amazing. Enjoy!
B000FBGBPC|4.0|Three Days Grace's 2003 debut effort was a heavy bash of alt-metal with just enough pop sounds thrown in to get them radio play. One-X, the groups sophmore effort, is the same. This 2006 release, though just sounds the same. Every song on here sounds the same. Same guitar riff, same drum beat, same boring vocal delivered on all twleve tracks. Granted, its a good sound to replicate because that means all of the songs, individually, are great. The drums do hit hard, the guitars are brutal, and the bass crashes down on the listener like a sac of one ton bricks. The musicianship is excellent. This is a very good sophmore effort, but when you listen to it, you'll find yourself asking \\"Didn't I just hear this one? Is it on repeat?\\" Its basically more of the same old Three Days Grace, but just be warned, that can get a little tedious.
B000089CJI|5.0|Personally, this is one of those cd's you can listen to when you're happy, sad, bored whatever...<br /><br />The fast catchy techno-like beats against the slower soft vocals is a very nice contrast. The beats alone keep me interested but the lyrics are sweet and cute with out being \\"bubblegum\\" and \\"stupid\\".<br /><br />Standout tracks:<br /><br />Nothing Better-awesome techno beat and great lyrics.<br /><br />The District Sleeps Alone Tonight-slow and sweet but speeds up at the end. wonderful melody<br /><br />Clark Gable-a fast disco type song. fun dance tune

B000001ESP|5.0|...years of Rush fandom.  I knew of Rush before I heard anything from Moving Pictures, but this was the first album of theirs I really heard.  My brother had the vinyl, and so began my odyssey--at the tender age of 13, I might add.  It's as good a jumping-off point as any for the beginning Rush fan; those not certain may wish to start with a best-of collection.  Rush Gold (their entry into Universal's budget-priced 2-CD collections, an amalgamation of the 2 Retrospective CDs from 1997) will serve that latter purpose most effectively, as it gives you the best of all the band's studio cuts from their years at Mercury Records (1974-89).<br /><br />\\"Tom Sawyer\\" is, of course, the leadoff track, and the one song even casual fans will recognise as Rush immediately, since classic rock radio has played it to death.  (I have to admit that, even as a Rush fan, this one track is hard to listen to more than a few times a year for me now, just because of overexposure.  Seeing them at Madison Square Garden on the Vapor Trails tour in 2002, I recall another audience member behind me refer to this as the \\"cheese-dick song.\\")  \\"Red Barchetta\\" may just be the very best song about a car ever written--how many songs did the Beach Boys ever write like this one?  \\"At the one-lane bridge, I leave the giants stranded at the riverside/Race back to the farm to dream with my uncle at the fireside....\\"  \\"Little Deuce Coupe\\" it ain't, and what a relief...<br /><br />\\"YYZ\\" was their second instrumental, and you could almost fit it into a medley with \\"La Villa Strangiato\\" (from Hemispheres) and \\"Where's My Thing?\\" from Roll the Bones...but this was Geddy, Alex and Neil at their lyricless best.  \\"Limelight\\" is as overplayed as \\"Tom Sawyer,\\" but it remains a personal favourite--Neil Peart was and is one of the very few lyricists who could put Shakespeare's words into the context of a 4:30 rock track (\\"All the world's indeed a stage/And we are merely players...\\") and make them work.  And \\"The Camera Eye\\" covers city-crowd anomie as only Rush can; this is the one track that has *never* gotten airplay from this album.<br /><br />Lastly, \\"Witch Hunt\\" is a powerful song about the creeping effects of ignorance, prejudice and superstition--images of Salem in 1693, the Spanish Inquisition, lynchings in Mississippi and the Night of the Long Knives haunt these lyrics.  And \\"Vital Signs\\" is the best Police song Sting never wrote.<br /><br />I have to admit that, like Led Zeppelin's 4th album, this is one album that no longer gets much spin time in my CD player, simply because of radio overkill.  I also think that Rush's catalogue is long overdue for a serious 5.1 Surround remaster; Universal was actually planning something along these lines until they basically abandoned the manufacture of DVD-Audio and SACDs for the more dubious DualDisc format.  The band's first 4 albums would have been the first to get this treatment, and I personally think somebody like Mobile Fidelity or Silverline ought to consider it.  This album and 2112 would benefit from such an overhaul, but I have doubts as to whether this will ever be done.  In the meantime, start your Rush collection here and work backward to the early albums, then forward into the later Mercury albums and on through the Atlantic years.<br /><br />And to the reviewer who said he may the only person who thinks Rush never made a bad album--you aren't.  I agree.  Some are not as strong (Caress of Steel is their weakest effort), but considering the band never discarded an idea, believing that all their songs had value and should be worked to their full realisation, you know they wouldn't have released something if they themselves hadn't believed in it.mera Eye\\" covers city-crowd anomie as only Rush can; this is the one track that has *never* gotten airplay from this album. <br /> <br />Lastly, \\"Witch Hunt\\" is a powerful song about the creeping effects of ignorance, prejudice and superstition--images of Salem in 1693, the Spanish Inquisition, lynchings in Mississippi and the Night of the Long Knives haunt these lyrics.

B000EWBNMS|4.0|<br /> <br /> <br /> <br />At first glance, 2005s MEDIUM will most defiantly seem like something of a replacement for \\"TRU-CALLING\\" (for those who actually watched the series before it was canceled by its network) during the midst of the supernatural craze going about in 2005. And like most, MEDIUM certainly had the wrappings of an NBC show soon to be canceled like most of its series coming out, but it surpassingly turns out to be something beyond the simple fact that main character can see and speak to the dead. At first I simply posed the question as to why MEDIUM was based on the escapades of a real-life medium Allison Dubois, when for a fact, this woman wasn't even dead yet (I'm still under the impression that for something to be based on a real person this person has to be dead)? Granted the first episode wasn't all impressive enough to me to even grant it a chance in my eyes. However, gradually, after its finale and rewatching the reruns (before it was logged onto Lifetime [shudders]) I began to appreciate MEDIUM for what it was and not what it wasn't or was obviously not trying to be (Tru Calling). A stunning mixture of science-fiction, crime-drama and supernatural realism -to a point-, with excellent writers and actors at the helm. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />[. . .Phoenix, Arizona local Allison Dubois (Patricia Arquette) is a strong-willed young mother of three, a devoted wife, and law student who starts an internship at a local District Attorney's office, begins to suspect that she can talk to dead people, see the future in her dreams, and read people's thoughts. Fearing for her mental health, she turns for support to her husband Joe (Jake Weber), an aerospace engineer, who slowly comes to believe that what his wife is telling him just might be true upon discovering that she dreams of a murder in Texas. The real challenge is convincing her boss, D.A. Devalos (Miguel Sandoval) -- and the other doubters in the criminal justice system -- that her psychic abilities can give them the upper hand when it comes to solving violent and horrifying crimes whose mysteries often reside with those who live beyond the grave.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Murders and information on certain people or things come to her dreams or visions in cryptic forms and never really mean what they seem to as Allison soon discovers throughout the series. Her daughters, Bridget and Ariel Dubois, appear to have inherited their mother's gift since their 'visions' or 'dreams' usually occur when their mother is in a bind in searching for answers to her own dreams. Bridget (the second youngest child) never appears to be bothered by this, while Ariel usually has a harder time trying to cope with a gift she knows very little about. Allison is occasionally accompanied by local Arizona cop, and friend to Manuel Devalos, Det. Lee Scanlon (David Cubitt), who, at first, also did not believe that she had a \\"gift\\" upon finding out about it. Allison often bends the rules of the law when she is determined to stop a vision from happening. . .] <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />The series is surprisingly gritty, even more so than NBC's \\"Law and Order\\", on par with shows like CSI and BONES to a point and uses or reveals its \\"violence\\" conservatively unlike most shows or movies that depend on this atmosphere alone. The atmosphere of the show itself is oddly borderline normal to an almost believable point. Unlike most series you can nearly believe that MEDIUM is real to a point, visually anyhow. Each episode is cleverly (and sometimes obviously) written and directed according to the person or crime Allison happens to be involved. It throws you for a loop and does the complete opposite of the original intent most of the time. And the end results usually don't fail in the surprising department, something most shows nowadays lack seriously. Though there are more than one episodes that contain the annoying \\"is my husband cheating on me?/Fighting spouses\\" themes that tend to get on my nerves. And unlike most NBC shows, MEDIUM has little or no sex scenes in a majority of the episodes which is always a plus with me. Characters potrayed by a lot of actors and actresses that would, at first glance, never seem to work well on screen, are quirky and frighteningly human and childish [concerning Ariel, Bridget, and Marie Dubois among other child actors].  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />I can only judge Allison Dubois' character by what I see on television since I've never met the real woman before in my adolescent life. Patricia Arquette usually does well with the female characters she chooses to play as. With what few films I've actually seen her in ---\\"HOLES\\" - \\"BEYOND RANGOON\\"-- I can say that she was an excellent choice for the Dubios character, who would usually be demoted to an overly dramatic character if played by another actress I believe. David Cubitt (10.5 - siggners) and Miguel Sandoval (Clear and Present Danger) potray their characters Lee Scanlon and Manuel Devalos with convincing placidity, dry humor, and professional seriousness that makes them so interesting. Sofia Vassilieva, Maria Lark, Madsion & Miranda Carabello, as Bridget, Ariel, and Marie Dubois are convincing as their characters and portray them as eerily normal children who seemed to have inherited pieces of their mother's rare gift. Lastly, Jake Weber (probably better known for his role in the \\"Dawn of the Dead\\" 04' remake) as Arquette's husband Joe Dubois as someone who took some major warming up to. Essentially he's an odd sort of person, he's a physically charming looking character as I so quickly noted but his personality was another thing. Nevertheless as time rolled on, I learned to like him the more I watched the series into the second season. Weber's talent, which is rarely noticed in most of the movies he's in, shines through in MEDIUM, giving a usually bland role a kick in the right direction with ability to be funny and serious at the same time. He and Arquette have excellent chemistry together when onscreen, its strange almost to think they're not actually husband and wife ^_^. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />The music composed for the series hauntingly ear catching and beautiful with the mournful vocals used in the theme song and BGM alike. While most scores for television series have a sound that really lets you know that its a TV show and not a movie their being used for, MEDIUM's score is composed in the motion picture style (like LOST, notably) as opposed to the usual TV-stylized composition. Whether or not is actually OST material is not something I'd rather not bother myself with since the score is most likely never to be released on CD. If it were, it would probably be worth owning for your own listening pleasure to a point. Of course there are times when its incredibly bland and tv-ish, its one of the best scores I've heard for an NBC produced show. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />[EPISODE LISTING]: <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />01.

B000FBGBPC|5.0|Ok i was fortunate to have this cd about 3 weeks ago and i still have not taken it out of my stereo and its the only thing my ipod is on at work!!!  My favorite 2 songs are Pain and Riot but the cd as a whole is freakin sweet.  The cd is a bit slower then their debut album but it showcases the band at it's high points including a solo in the opening track and the typical power chords that made the first cd so awesome.  This cd explores more powerful lyrics that have a direct meaning to my life and im sure many others as well.  this is a must have cd for anyone that loves this band and for people that have not heard to much of these guys get this cd and their debut and rock out!!!
B000FBGBPC|5.0|Normally I wait a while to review a cd, like a long time, so I can enjoy everything that the band has to offer....But I just couldn't wait. I seen Three Days Grace live, they opened for Staind, and they were promoting their new cd that just came out today, and I was like \\"No f'in way!\\" It's about time you guys put out a new album, and it better be good. Don't worry they cover it all. I got the cd today, and it just rocks. I'm so glad I got to hear some of their new songs live first, otherwise I wouldn't have been as interested. Pain, Animal I Have Become, and Riot were the songs that I remember the most live. They were so intense and up lifting that I just couldn't wait for the album. You must get this album if you are a fan of their first. Gone Forever and One X are also great because those songs keep in tie with their same style from the first. Make sure you get the release with the bonus track RUNNING AWAY. Great song! Their first self titled album, or III, is a must have before this one. If you can see them live in a city near you, do it! They are finishing up their tour. One-X nails it right to ya, great artwork too.

B000F5GNX8|4.0|Very slickly produced big budget crime movie that oozes  <br />with a knowingly quirky style.  <br /> <br />Some cool acting from Downey, Kilmer. Quite funny in parts with witty one-liners.  <br /> <br />The final half of movie becomes disappointley conventional and the movie ends up feeling a little too smug for its own good.  <br /> <br />It's a hollow but then again fun ride, what more do you want? <br />  <br />A DVD worth a spin!
B000FVQM2Y|5.0|Closely following the literary works of Dashiell Hammet, Brick is a mystery not unlike The Maltese Falcon, but there's a twist.  This story of drugs, scandal and murder takes place in a High School in Southern California.  The writing and superb adaptation drops you into the story just like the novella the movie is based on.  At times, the poetic dialogue makes you forget that these are just kids and the subtle reminders of this fact add to the clever comedic moments. <br /> <br />Brick is an amazing movie.  Definately the best written movie I have ever seen. I couldn't recommend it more strongly.
B000FBGBPC|5.0|This is an excellent sophomore album from TDG.  I don't know why there saying its softer than the first, if anything its heavier than there last cd.  There are a few soft songs on here but then again theres more heavy than soft songs like Pain, Riot, Animal I Have Become, It's All Over, Let It Die, and One X.  I waited for 3 years for this disc to come out and the wait is definately worth it, even though they told me it was suppose to come out in 2005 that was a long year waiting for releases to come out.  Well so far this is one of the better releases of 2006 other than RHCPS Stadium Arcadium that one is the best release of 2006 (so far).  I just hope there third album doesn't take another 3 years to be released I don't think I'll be able to wait that long for something from Three Days Grace.
B000094HMU|5.0|When I first saw this production on VHS in 1994, I was really bowled over with the fine singing and acting from all the principals. James Levine and his MET Orchestra produced fine sound and sensative accompaniment and overall, this production really impressed me. I vowed that when it came out on DVD, I would be the first to get a copy. This was over 3 years ago! I watch this DVD repeatedly and I am still bowled over with the overall effect of the singing and staging. Eva Marton as Turandot has been superbly costumed and directed by Franco Zefferelli and to my ears, a fine Turandot. She owns the stage in Act 2 Scene 2 and her curtain call at the end of the opera is a well-deserved ovation! Domingo had a bit of an off night with this performance, but still manages to deliver the goods as Calaf. Leona Mitchell will make you cry with her singing as Liu and the rest of the cast is first rate! This will be a difficult choice amongst some people, however the only competition will be the 1983 Vienna Turandot with Harold Prince directing and Lorin Maazel conducting.

0596009208|4.0|This has to be one of the most entertaining introductory texts I have read. In addition, by rephrasing key points in multiple ways, and including fun exercises, the series is one of the better ways to learn new material. Head First Java covered a vast amount of material in relatively few pages and included material that you usually don't see in other beginning books such as networking, RMI, and even mention of Jini! It also covered Java 5 topics including generics!<br /><br />Over the decades, I've seen a lot of really bad habits. Many of these bad habits were learned in introductory texts. I'd therefore like to see these texts teach best practices. In general, this book seemed to do this (for example, it mentioned that implementing Runnable is preferable to extending Thread), but missed on a few accounts.<br /><br />- Sequential code was shoved into methods called \\"go\\".<br /><br />  Tell me, what does this method do? Names such as \\"go\\", \\"doit\\", and \\"init\\" are common, but are not very informative names. Good names make your code easy to use; bad names doom your code forever to obscurity. The examples should have simply put the sequential code directly in the main method. If the code was meant to be shared, then it should have been put in a method that describes what it does (for example, createBeatBoxPanel()). See Martin Fowler's book \\"Refactoring\\" for more on this subject.<br /><br />- The examples use \\"// close methodName\\" comments.<br /><br />  This convention was born in the bad old days when sloppy programmers created unreadable blocks that were hundreds or even thousands of lines long. Since it is far easier to read and maintain code when blocks are less than a page long, these comments are unnecessary and reduce white space (which is a far more effective separator).<br /><br />- The examples used hard-coded numbers.<br /><br />  Never, ever use hard-coded numbers in your code (other than, say, a starting index of 0 or 1). You'll make the code impossible to decipher and prone to error. If you saw the number 31536000, would you have any idea of what it represented? Wouldn't you prefer to see SECONDS_PER_YEAR? The other advantage is for maintainability. If you had to change a value, you only have to do it in one place if you use constants. If you were to use hard-coded numbers and needed to increase your Animals array from 4 elements to 8, say, you'd have to do a global search and replace to change the places which referenced the number of Animals. When you did so, you'd inadvertently give a month 8 weeks in another part of your code.<br /><br />- The examples used implementations instead of interfaces.<br /><br />  Prefer interfaces over implementations in method parameters and return types as well as in declarations. This keeps your code flexible. The examples included code such as \\"ArrayList&lt;SomeType> cards = new ArrayList&lt;SomeType>()\\". Unless your code is actually methods specific to ArrayList, it is better to change this declaration to \\"List&lt;SomeType> cards = new ArrayList&lt;SomeType>()\\". Later on, you can create a LinkedList without having to change the rest of your code.<br /><br />- There were more typos than I'd like to see.<br /><br />I would have given the book 5 stars if it weren't for these, but if you're new to Java, get this book and print this note.

B000002LRX|4.0|Angel Dust is one of those cds that was just too ahead of its time. Mike Pattons vocals are amazing on this cd going from singing(\\"Everythings Ruined\\"), to screaming like a demon(\\"Jizzlobber\\") and laughing like a maniac in \\"Land of Sunshine\\". We could thank FNM and Mr. Patton for bands like System of a Down. From start to finish, this album is flawless. What a way to follow up a radio-friendly album. Srongest tracks on this album include \\"Caffeine\\", \\"Smaller and Smaller\\" and \\"Malpractice\\". Songs like \\"A Small Victory\\", \\"Crack Hitler\\" and \\"RV\\" showcase the bands ability to put themselves in a genre of their own. FNM is still able to mix all this madness up with some great, catchy songs such as \\"Midlife Crisis\\" and \\"Everythings Ruined\\". In my opinion this is one of the most underated albums of all time from one of the most underated bands of the 90s. This band went on to influence countless great modern bands and introduced us to a musical genius and one of the greatest vocalists of all time: Mike Patton. Believe it or not, this album could've been even better. I recommend throwing on \\" The World is Yours\\", \\"Easy\\" and \\"As the Worm Turns (Patton)\\" to your own mix which were all recorded during these sessions. Thank You Faith No More
B0000026CM|5.0|\\"The Seventh One\\" is one of Toto's best, underrated albums. Some time ago, I read a commentary that Toto's best albums were those with the sword on the front.  I would definitely have to agree with that reviewer.<br /><br />As with most of their albums, \\"The Seventh One\\" is extremely well polished.  Great melodies, great orchestration, fantastic solos....One factor that I've always appreciated about Toto, like Chicago, is their ability to \\"share the wealth.\\"  Not one member dominates the song-writing, like Boston or ELO; not one singer dominates all of the songs (characteristic of some bands); not one member dominates all of the solos.  Toto's variety provides a balance, which also provides interest for the listener.<br /><br />What makes this album great is that it truly displays Toto's versatility in different genres and artistry.  If you want a real rocker, \\"Stay Away,\\" featuring Linda Rondstadt on backing vocals, or \\"Only the Children\\" will more than satisfy your craving. If you're in a Latin mood, check out \\"Mushanga.\\" This track features the father Porcaro on percussion, in addition to studio musicians playing steel drums, recorder, and flute.  \\"Anna\\" is a beautiful ballad written by Steve Lukather; \\"You Got Me\\" and \\"Stop Loving You\\" are typical pop-rock tunes. Of course, the album wouldn't be complete with their signature shuffle beat - check out \\"These Chains\\" and \\"Pamela,\\" which includes James Pankow from Chicago in the brass section.<br /><br />If you're interested in Toto and looking for an album to begin listening to, check out this one or \\"Toto IV\\" out.  I guarantee you won't be disappointed.
B00000IQBM|2.0|`The Shining' is a ghost story about an unemployed, recovering alcoholic teacher trying to make it as a writer. The only job that he can find is as a caretaker for the Overlook Hotel in Colorado's Rocky Mountains, which shuts down every winter only to reopen in the spring. Despite stories of previous murders at the hotel, Jack Torrance moves there with his wife, Wendy, and young son, Danny, who is telepathic (Dick Halloran, the head cook, tells Danny, he has the shining.) The hotel is possessed by some of life force and the ghost's of previous visitors who died violently. Danny feels and sees these ghosts, but he keeps it to himself and resists them. Whatever this force is, it slowly begins to take over Jack Torrance and he begins to terrorize his family just like the previous caretaker.<br /><br />I am a big fan of Stephen King's novels and `The Shining' was one of the best. This movie, however, does not do the book justice. With the exception of the great Scatman Crothers, everyone is terribly miscast in this film. Shelley Duvall is unbelievable and mousy in her roll as Jack Nicholson's wife. Jack Nicholson is hopelessly miscast as Jack Torrance. When I originally saw this film in the theatre, the audience howled in laughter at Mr. Nicholson in the scene where he interviews for the job. He looked crazier then rather than later on in the film, when he chases Shelley Duvall around with an axe (at which point the audience cheered him on.) Stanley Kubrick stated that he did not like ghost stories, he did not believe in ghosts and he was not going to make this movie as a ghost story. It shows. I must be the only person on the planet who believes Mr. Kubrick to be the most overrated, untalented director ever.<br /><br />The only reason that this film gets two stars is because it is, if nothing else, a visually stunning film and the soundtrack is hauntingly beautiful with music from Wendy Carlos, Bela Bartok and Gyorgi Ligeti. Compare this film with the three part television version by Director Mick Garris (starring Rebecca DeMornay and Steven Weber) and you will see that the latter is much better.Director Mick Garris (starring Rebecca DeMornay and Steven Weber) and you will see that the latter is much better.
B000002AS3|1.0|It is now official:  According to a poll done by the book \\"British Hit Singles and Albums\\" and \\"NME.com\\", 2 June 2006, this is now the No.1 album of all time.  It has displaced \\"Sgt. Pepper\\".  Yeah, and the Dave Clark 5 are better than the Beatles, Diabelli is better than Mozart, Cherubini is better than Beethoven, Def Leppard is better than the Rolling Stones, and Oasis is better than ANYONE that ever made a rock album.  Give me a break.  It is listenable. That is about all you can say positive about it.  I could say a lot that is negative, but what's the point?  The Monkees \\"Greatest Hits\\" album has more innovation (really, I'm serious --  I'm not knocking the Monkees).  The most overrated album of all time.  Put your money to better use. <br /> <br />
B000063Y8F|5.0|I have tried every type of garlic press on the market, and this one is by the far the best in my experience. It is an exceptionally well-engineered tool, and it is a joy to use. I recommend it without reservation. In the long run, you'll save money buying this one as it is built to last and is probably the last one you'll ever buy.
0679893431|3.0|One of the books which I keep wondering why I don't really like it. But there are lots of small reasons, none of them major but they all add up. <br /> <br />Firstly, the illustrations, while simple are dull, there is only black red and I think yellow or brown. It just doesn't bring things to life <br /> <br />Secondly, the story seems pointless - animals putting apples on their heads. I am probably missing the point as my children enjoy the story - but as a nonsense rhyme it doesn't appeal to me <br /> <br />Thirdly, while there is counting, I don't get a sense of drama out of it which I think they are trying to imbue to get you counting the apples. <br /> <br />This could have been better in a number of ways, but I will pretty much hope my children pick something else to read. There is little to appeal to adults in this one. (which is important I think for a children's book, after all, it is usually the adult who reads it to them at this age.)
0064409422|5.0|The first of the series of stories about Aslan and Narnia.<br />Four children-Peter, Susan , Edmund and Lucy , are sent into the country , from London, during World War II , because of air raids.<br />They are sent to the house of an old Professor , in the heart of the country.<br />There the youngest , Lucy comes across an old wardrobe , and stumbles through it into the Land of Narnia , who she meets Mr Tumnus , a faun.<br />Later Edmund also go's through the wardrobe into Narnia , where he meets the White Witch , who lures him into her service , with magic Turkish Delight.<br />Later all of the children are swept into the adventure where the White Witch , who rules with an iron fist over Narnia , tries to prevent the prophecy whereby the lion , will free Narnia and change the eternal winter (where Christmas is not allowed) into the enchanted land which it once was.<br />Filled with all sorts of creatures , fauns , mermaids and mermen , dwarfs, centaurs , minotaurs etc , this enchanted story pits the forces of good against the forces of evil , in an exciting adventure which will appeal to children aged 9 to 12.<br /><br />A strong testament to Judeo-Christian values and a reminder that evil and terror  must be fought head on , it cannot be accomodated or negotiated with.
B0007OCG4W|5.0|Damien Rice might have written the song for the movie, maybe not but it fit perfectly, if not in the beginning than definetly in the ned, making the movie that muhc more powerful to see how sad it all is. If it just seems like another movie with snippy love triangles than the difference here is, besides the UNBELIEVABLE cast, that there are only four people in the movie. Literally four people that the camera focuses on. This is draws the audience that much closer (no pun intended) to the characters and movie.<br /><br />After the first time I saw it I had a couple of questions i really needed answered, as is with most movies, and I think the second time made it easier to understand the chaging scenes and going abck forth through time, and I guess the main point of the movie is to portray how powerful attraction and love is for one's happiness. Jude Law and Julia Roberts are amazing in this movie, certainly may not be their best stuff, but they are uncomparable to Natalie Portman and Clive Owen. Clive, it seems, is the only happy person by the end of the movie, at the same time the most pathetic, at the same time the only person who understands anything. Julia is still unhappy and confused of what would make her happy, one relationship is for passion and attraction, while the other is the right way to stay stable and protected. Torn at the end, Jude is left with no one because of his own mistake, and while Natalie may be the most remembered character from the movie, she is certianly the biggest mystery. Why didn't she expose her real name? And when did she stop loving Jude, if she ever actually loved him at all.<br /><br />Reviews don't really give off the intensity of such a terrific movie becaue it just sounds like a bunch of sappy lines. It will keep you thinking a little more, like Garden State did, like Eternal Sunshine may have, like In Good Coompany probably wanted to.
B000F3AAUW|5.0|WOW! I haven't enjoyed a CD this much in 10 YEARS... since the afore-mentioned Beck. DJ Danger Mouse does it again! I couldn't believe it the first time I heard this CD. <br /> <br />Think 60's Motown meets Sir Mouse... a bit Al Green, Miracles, Temptations, Spinners and even Dionne Warwick with an amazing backbeat and a lyrical darkside. Funky, soulful R
B000EULJLU|4.0|This band has always made interesting music to me, Lateralus was good, but this album puts some more heavy elements into it, which is good. <br /> <br />If you're looking for a good Progressive Metal album, then you should pick this up.
B0007XT7V8|5.0|I love this band and I love this album but my copy is obviously censored. There are many spots where the audio drops out and in some instances, it is easy to tell where the F word would be. I hate the fact that they are doing this to so much music these days but because I am over 50 years old, I should have a choice. Has anyone else noticed this problem? Is there an uncensored version?
087033039X|5.0|This is pretty much as good as leather braiding instruction books get for people who want to make authentic, impressive, usable things, right now.  <br /> <br />It describes and illustrates how to braid a range of items, plainly and clearly. The content is wider than it is deep (Grant later produced an encyclopedia that is exhaustive), but the items chosen are core items in the craft: belts, straps, handles, grips, decorative thongs, more.  <br /> <br />Most items shown in the book you might see anyplace today, not common or rare, but probably admired. At least one item is from Conquistidor days, and is now seldom seen anyplace at all: you might have to go to a museum to see an original. The braid itself is simple and effective enough that it's a puzzle how it became rare. In this way, for tidbits of this sort, it is a neat book. <br /> <br />The illustrations are usual quality for 1940's craft articles, which is how the content was first published. This can surprise a modern eye, one used to the present efforts to make books buyer-attractive. But this too is authentic. Writing and content are fine, practical and direct. However, there is no hint of \\"tricking the process,\\" as is sometimes seen now in instructions on how to do things. Mr. Grant goes straight to the method that a cowboy or outdoorsman, or the Lady of a working farm or ranch, might use to produce things better than, more beautiful than, or more suitable for use than what they could buy. <br /> <br />There is a low tool count, and a short materials list. Plain instructions for making or improvising tools unique to braiding and making leather lace are given. There is no cure, of course, for the acute shortage of cows and their hides seen now in the typical city, as compared to the mid-19th-century Texas Mr. Grant grew up in.  <br /> <br />For a person who needed one braided item today, say to complement a basket or a box purse, or some themed item for a Western or outdoorsy room, and who also wanted to be able to say \\"I did that,\\" this book is a good choice.  <br /> <br />It is also a good choice for people who like books, on any subject, that won't sing or dance but which carry a full load of reliable information on their subject matter, and which are good either to give or to keep. Any copy of \\"Leather Braiding\\" that lasts long enough will find a friend. <br />
B000002NJS|5.0|This record has nothing to do with pop music. Afterall, in my point of view this is the queen of pop's BEST record. Its totally a mature peice of artistic work that didnt fail Madonna from trying to work with electronica. Frozen, the power of goodbye and ray of light are all major hits that i dont have to write about. But i do beleive that there are other songs in this album that are nothing less than those hits. SKIN is amazing, SKY FITS HEAVEN and NOTHING REALLY MATTERS are simply breathtaking.. i really can't explain it with words. AMAZING! PLEASE DON'T MISS IT..
1400079179|4.0|I am simply tired of the pseudo-intellectual snobs reviewing this book with an overly critical eye for literary value. Of course The Da Vinci Code isn't going to win a Pulitzer Prize, but who cares? Dan Brown has created a wonderful, formulaic novel that captivates the reader from beginning to end--and isn't that why we picked this book up in the first place?<br /><br />For those of you who do want to read a literary masterpiece, I have a little advice: Don't look in the paperback best-sellers section of your local bookstore! Instead, enroll in an English course at your local university, or simply read books like The Castle of Otranto or Tom Jones in you free time. But whatever you do, don't purchase a book like The Da Vinci Code and expect it to be A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius. That's just silly.<br /><br />As for the whole Mary Magdalene debate: If this book shakes the foundations of your faith and makes you seriously reconsider your religious beliefs, then you are one pathetic Christian.
B000002LND|5.0|This is simply the best greatest hits collection i own. It's great. i bought it when i was 13(5 years ago) and i still play it daily. Though i didnt experience the 80's, were madonna was at the top. This collection really convinced me that shes the ultimate and only Queen of Pop.<br /><br />The tracks are amazing!! All of them are. I mean if you like pop music. THIS IS FOR YOU! otherwise dont bother. i'm not completely satisfied with it though. To be named the immaculate collection it needed more hits like Burning up, dress you up, Causing a commotion to be added. Anyways its great
B000BTC5LW|5.0|This DVD is due to be released on July 11th. Today is June 13th. How can there be reviews of a DVD that has not yet been released? Regardless, I'm eagerly anticipating the release of this DVD.
B00008BXJG|4.0|AC/DC are the TRUE \\"gods of rock\\".  No matter who is behind the microphone (Bonn/Brian).  And this album put them on the map.  I won't detail every song, but if you listen to \\"Night Prowler\\" alone & in the dark, you will feel a cold chill rise up through your spine.  Recommended!
B000001FTD|5.0|Considering all the controversy surrounding the band these days, the main reason the reunion happened was because of this album.  Anthrax was hitting on all cylinders when they recorded this - this album is flawless.<br /><br />They never topped this album, and really never came close with Bush, through no fault of his own.  I don't think he really fit in with Anthrax and like has happened with other bands, Anthrax ended up changing stylistically to the point where they lost nearly all of their fans.  It also didn't help that they had 4 different lead guitarists on successive albums, one of which was in fact the roadie.  It's no wonder they got the classic lineup back - they had no choice.<br /><br />If the new album is even half as good as Among the Living, it'll be considered a smash.
B00004W3L3|4.0|Very good CD. Fish is a born suicidal romantic.  Excellent musicians, deep lyrics and moody subjects propel this above most Euro-motional 80's era sagas.  Recommended.
0440237688|4.0|We are German students and we read the book in our English lessons. It was easy to understand and the story was exciting. <br />The book`s ending was a little bit strange because we didnt understand if Jonas (the main character) died or if he really found this `Elsewhere` he was searching for. We liked the description of the community Lois Lowry wrote about. <br />All in all we think that the book is nice to read...
B000059XUO|3.0|A fairly decent film.  Brandon Lee's best (and unfortunately last) role.  Somewhat predictable and lame acting from the film's heavies, but the dark tone, decent storyline and OUTSTANDING sountrack help us overcome the shortcomings.  Watch this film when your girlfriend is feeling sentimental.
0440237688|3.0|The Giver is about a boy named Jonas who lives in an utopia where everything is controlled by rules. There is neither pain nor war nor feelings. When he becomes twelve he is chosen to be the new Receiver of Memory. Now he gets to know the truth about the community by his mentor, the Giver, and wants to change it.  <br />Slowly the reader gets to know how the community works - in great difference to reality. The story is very different to other stories which makes it interesting. You can identify with Jonas and understand his thoughts and decisions. We don't like the ending because you can never be sure what happened to Jonas and the community. If you like reading science-fiction, you will have fun reading this book. We absolutely recommend reading it for pupils at the age of 14.
B00000294R|5.0|As said before, very underrated album. Big L is definately an amazing MC: tights flows, great ghetto stories, and devestating battle raps. Probably the best out-and-out blood-thirsty gangster rapper of his genre (and no, Jay-Z, Pac(what flow???), and post-Illmatic Nas don't compete, and can't rap about anything other than materialism over weak instrumental beats). The production's a real treat too, with some of the Diggin In The Crates' finest like Lord Finesse and Showbiz on the beats, so some great, menacing drawn-out jazz smapling setting the dark soundscapes for Big L's darker lyrics. While deliberately OTT, Big L's lyrics don't go far beyond disses and gangster glorification, but when done as fantastically as this, who cares?
B00003CXDV|4.0|Unlike most parodies Galaxy Quest has storyline. Granted, the storyline is utterly outrageous but it is also utterly hilarious. It also has some strong characters, something which really drives a good story but the thing that sets Galaxy Quest apart from other parodies is that it isn't really a parody. Sure, it's main purpose is to poke fun at Star Trek and its fans but what stands out as you watch the film is that you don't have to know everything about Star Trek to enjoy it.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I just love this movie.  I watched it without a clue of what it was going to be like.  I fell madly in love with Mr. Darcy.  He is very passionate and intense.  I just love his whole character.  After, I had to watch the Colin Firth version.  Although I'm a Mr. Darcy fan of Bridge Jones's Diary, I have to say I prefer this newer Mr. Darcy over Firth.
B000AJJNPY|5.0|Sigur Ros is an incredible band. They use so many different sounds to adjust the mood until it's just right... the album sounds so meticulously crafted. You can almost see the album unfolding, as opposed to just hearing it. The music draws pictures in your head. Not like that of a soundtrack, but the music brings up images that can bring up your deepest emotions.  This album was the best $20 I spent all year. It has been a long time since I've gotten such enjoyment out of any type of modern music. Powerchords and pop-riffs just don't do it anymore. The complexity yet simplicity (if that makes sense) of the soundscapes created by Sigur Ros are unparalleled by anything I have ever heard. Takk has much more emotion and character than the album I've been listening to for almost three years running, Lift Yr. Skinny Fists Like Antennas to Heaven by Godspeed You! Black Emperor. Takk is an album I would not miss. Probably not the sparkle in a pop-rock listener's eye, but any Pink Floyd or Godspeed fan will greatly appreciate what Sigur Ros have done here.
B00005JKG5|4.0|Flashback.  Spring 1983.  I'm huddled with my fellow English majors at Temple University commiserating over the latest Woody Allen snoozer.  \\"Flashdance\\" comes up and derisive laughter emits from the elitist swine.  A few months later same film was playing free of charge at the student movie theatre.  Try as I must the sight of Jenny and the off-the-shoulder sweatshirt was too much of an enticement.  Oh, well!  What's the loss of a few brain cells?  Flash forward.  Spring 2006.  Jenny comes calling again.  How has this confection held up?  Very well, thank you.  For sure it's predictable, preposterous, and formulaic.  If the formula works, why complain?  What is the legacy of this cultural milestone of the Reagan era?  It probably begat \\"Showgirls\\", \\"Striptease\\", and \\"Coyote Ugly\\".  It also spawned a porn parody, \\"Fleshdance\\".  In the eighties Paramount seemed to have it's finger on the national zeitgeist with films like \\"An Officer and a Gentleman\\", \\"Footloose\\", \\"Top Gun\\", \\"Crocodile Dundee\\", and \\"Beverly Hills Cop\\".  What did that say about us as a people?  Darned if I know!  Irene Cara got an Oscar for the title song(Martin Scorsese still doesn't have one).  Anybody interested in Jennifer Beals' subsequent filmwork should check her out in the superb \\"Devil in a Blue Dress\\".  I haven't seen her on \\"The 'L' Word\\" because I don't have Showtime.
B00005LC1H|2.0|that the dedicated fans of this show presume everybody who sees the show loves it. That is far from the case. Many people can watch Python or FT and easily nopt enjoy it. I for one see little humor in this series. Remember FT/python fans you don't speak for everyone when you write how you admire these tv works.
0689854684|5.0|Treasure Island by Robert Louis Stevenson <br /> <br />This is a sea-fairing tale of a boy named Jim finding himself entangled on a considerably large pirate adventure. In the beginning of this sea story Jim and his parents ran an inn named the \\"Admiral Benbow\\" a shady character that ends up being a pirate walks in and that is how it all started. He soon finds himself part of a crew in the Hispaniola, Captain Smollett runs the crew along with a Mr. Trelawny, and the mysterious one-legged chief Long John Silver. Silver and his crew betray the captain with mutiny, and take over the ship, forcing the doctor, Jim, Mr. Telwany, Mr. Grey, the captain and some loyal sailors to ship out in the smaller boat, the Jolly Boat. Being chased by the Hispaniola, the Jolly Boat quickly takes ashore on Treasure Island. This is the last place where a great battle between good and evil takes place just for reckless greed. This book, in my opinion deserves a 5 out of 5 because it has great plot twists devious and memorable characters.  <br /> <br />
B000002KHY|5.0|R u kidding me!! These ppl complaining about the obscenities in steamroller need to get a life!!!! You cant even hear the \\"F\\" word!!! Just Listen to it! its a great song just like all the others (Country Road is my fav.) But really... dont let these ppl dissuade you w/ there reviews about \\"Pg-13 warnings\\". THeere are cds out there with the \\"F\\" word in every song that dont have advisorys on them. Skip that song if it bothers you that much, dont give the entire album 1 freakin star!!!! Its one of my fav!!!!Just buy this album filled w/ great songs INCLUDING STEAMROLLER!!!! YEAAAAA!!!!!
B00006LLLN|5.0|Bluegrass music has a great heritage, drawing from the same sources as blues and jazz.  In fact, bluegrass is more like those improvisational styles than to country, a fact unrecognized by many.  <br /> <br />Still, the image bluegrass evokes in most folks is twangy, out of tune and \\"jingly\\" music.  That is unfortunate.  <br /> <br />Allison Krauss and Union Station have more Grammy awards than any other female artist or bluegrass artist in history.  Their musicianship is unparalleled, their intonation flawless, their arrangements are mature.  <br /> <br />But they do play dobro, fiddle, banjo, upright bass, mandolin and guitar.  And they do pay homage to the fathers of bluegrass, Bill Monroe and Ralph Stanley.  <br /> <br />This album and DVD won Grammys, including one for Best Bluegrass instrumental recording:  \\"Cluck Old Hen.\\"  But the songs and delivery are the reason to buy this recording.   <br /> <br />Of course, the album is sprinkled with hits by AKUS, but it's the other songs that break my heart.  I especially like \\"Ghost in this House\\" and \\"Tiny Broken Heart.\\"   <br /> <br />Technically, the album is a beautiful document of a live performance.  The sound quality is pristine and the mix is pure.  With AKUS, there is no need to process the intonation in the studio;  their intonation is spot on.   <br /> <br />This recording was made and released after \\"Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?\\" which featured AKUS on the soundtrack.  Of course, their version of \\"Man of Constant Sorrow\\" sung by Dan Tyminski is included on this recording.  <br /> <br />People who didn't think they would enjoy bluegrass changed their mind after listening to this record.  I have purchased many copies to give away as gifts;  in fact, I give this away more than any other CD I enjoy.  <br /> <br />Give it a shot.
B000025RX4|5.0|I saw Johnny Winter And when they were promoting this album in 1970(?) in Des Moines, Iowa. What a show!!! I had never seen a band so wild and good! They rocked the house that night. I thought I would catch up on the tunes this year and got the CD. I am surprised this is as good as I remember--actually better than I remember! The interplay on the guitars is exciting. Winter  dominates the CD--even when he plays rhythm guitar. He truly is a talent of great magnitude. The band, Derringer and company (And),  are tasteful and solid. They provide an excellent base for Winter to build on. I saw Winter's rock 'n roll panned by Docendo--the blues reviewer guy--and I understand his purity for the blues. For me though, if an artist can play in more than one style and be as expressive and skilled as Winter, and if it moves me, then I'm sold. Winter can play slide steel guitar, electric blues or rock 'n roll and I'm there listening!
B000FFJ85I|3.0|As a longtime AFI fan, I get really annoyed at people who claim that if you do not like this album, you never were an AFI fan or you are not a true AFI fan.  That is ridiculous.  You people would like anything that AFI put out no matter how terrible (not that this is terrible). <br /> <br />That said, I also was not expecting the same sound from AFI with this album.  Every album up to this one I have really liked.  I really liked STS, with my favorite being Black Sails followed by Art of Drowning.  These three albums sound completely different so it's ridiculous to claim that people like me want to hear the same thing over and over.  I knew it was going to be slower with maybe a few faster songs put in.  And there is a lot of slow music that I really like. <br /> <br />With that said, I just have to say that most of the songs are not good, even for the kind of music they are.  What they lack is originality and an interesting sound and passion (in general), which is what has always made AFI's music so good in the past (classics such as 6 to 8 and This Time Imperfect come to mind).  The instrumentals/singing are not rockin' like they are in Black Sails and Art of Drowing, but even in the songs meant to be slower, they are not interesting to listen to (with rare exceptions) or passionate. <br /> <br />I think \\"Affliction\\" is just terrible (though the breakdown is pretty good).  It is fast and harder, sure, but it does not sound good at all.  The screaming makes me reach for the button to skip to the next track.  It does not have the passion that was present in the screaming of \\"Death of Seasons\\" or anything on Black Sails. <br /> <br />A song isn't good just because it is hard and from AFI.  Hard AFI songs that were awesome are songs like Death of Seasons, The Last Kiss, ...but Home is Nowhere, The Lost Souls, Porphyria, etc.  Affliction or Kill Caustic are just not written that well.  They do not sound good.  The songs do not flow and the singing is just not very interesting or powerful.  Even on the slower songs, the singing has nothing like the passion found on This Time Imperfect or Morningstar. <br /> <br />Even on the slower songs, I just hear too many other bands in what AFI is doing.  Their originality that marked all of their previous albums is almost completely absent.  Most of their songs sound pretty good, but not compared to anything they have released before.  By \\"pretty good\\", I mean it is okay to listen to when filling the time, but I find myself wanting to move on to another album when I listen to Decemberunderground frequently. <br /> <br />There are exceptions to all this criticism.  Notably, the end of Endlessly, She Said and towards the end of Kiss and Control, the singing gives me chills.  The Missing Frame also is a good song.  I actually do like a lot of the songs, but few (if any) of them are *amazing songs* which so many on their previous records are filled with.  From previous albums, examples of amazing songs are God Called in Sick Today and The Last Kiss (BS), Days of the Phoenix and Morningstar (AOD), and But Home is Nowhere and This Time Imperfect (STS).  The closest Decemberundeground comes is Kiss and Control and Missing Frame.  Unfortunately, even these songs are not amazing taken as a whole.  Kiss and Control has an amazing breakdown, I'll admit.  I love the song but as a whole it cannot compare to AFI's best. <br /> <br />This album is also not \\"better than most other music out there today\\".  While that is probably true within the mainstream, there is plenty of really good music that is not heard on the radio that is way better music than Decemberunderground.  Check out Sonata Arctica for an amazing band.  And the fact remains that this album pales in comparison to AFI's best, even considering it within its own style. <br /> <br />Lastly, I don't think the lyrics, however depressing and cool they are, can save this album.  I am reviewing music, not poetry.  Maybe Decemberunderground is good poetry, but it is not very good music.
1416524800|4.0|Dan Brown's talent lies in his ability to craft plots so true to the worlds of science and politics. The adventure in Deception Point is so realistic that it leaves the reader's heart pounding. Although there are seemingly few suspects, the result is a jaw-dropping one.
B00004ZD69|5.0|To truly appreciate Godspeed You! Black Emperor and the band's compositions is to undertake a different mode of musical consumption. The band, and its records are not easily devoured, picked-up, and left off. To truly, and completely appreciate what the band does, one is required to, at least, see the song from beginning to end, and at best, follow the album through its entirety. GSY!BE, its albums and its songs are best taken in it entirety, as opposed to the sum of its parts (though many do, stand solidly on its own).  <br /> <br />Extended periods of droning ambiance, white/grey noise and subtle strumming serve to contrast for louder and more dominant movements (and make no mistake, the songs are written movement). Parts that may be conceived of are boring are most likely misunderstood.  <br /> <br />If a listener really wishes to appreciate the piece as a whole, think of quiet moments as the serene breath before a driving exhalation. <br /> <br />Oh, and to be accurate, this album was release in Oct. 2000, whereas UxO was released in Nov. of 2004.
B000DZIGDU|5.0|Am I too easily impressed by Jarhead because I was never a member of the military?  Do those who have actually served find the film to be over the top and a distortion of reality?  Whatever, I can only say that I enjoyed Jarhead immensely.  We sleep peacefully only because such brutal and well trained individuals are guarding our nation.  The concerns of Thomas Hobbes must be resolved long before we can pay attention to the democratic principles of John Locke.  Anthony Swofford's experiences as a Marine sniper during Desert Storm shows the less than perfect humanity of those who kill the sworn enemies of the United States.  These brave men are often vulgar, excessively macho, and rarely politically correct.  They are sent into harm's way by our elected officials.  Do they always understand the purpose of their sacrifices?  No, sometimes our committed warriors are perplexed.  A secular faith in the democratic process is required.  Civilians ultimately make the decisions---and the military must obey.  Swofford and his buddies are ordered to defeat Saddam Hussein's attempt to monopolize the oil industry in the Middle East.  At the end, the dictator is humiliated but survives.  Our politicians decide not to eradicate Saddam's regime.  Might this disillusion the more idealistic Marine? It doesn't matter. A Marine must obey. This is the way it has to be.  Utopia is not possible on this side of the grave.  A democratic society can only do the best it can.<br /><br />There are no weak performances in Jarhead.  The acting is superb.  To an outsider like myself, these Marines seem like the real deal.  Take a chance on this film.  The risk is worth it.  I consider Jarhead to be a five star experience.  Maybe you will agree.<br /><br />David Thomson<br />Flares into Darkness
B000EULJLU|5.0|**I may be slightly biased about my love for the album, as I believe Tool is the best band in the world, ever.  Regardless, this album is looked at objectively, just like anything else I'd review.  I am simply writing this review to help disprove some of the previous reviews given for a fairer judgment of this release.** <br /> <br />From the kings of prog-rock, Tool brings their fourth full-length studio album into the light with \\"10,000 Days\\", and it is a warm welcome.  Starting from beginning to finish, the 75 minute long epic presents topics that force themselves to be discussed amongst the intellectuals, rhythms that present to artists and musicians everywhere how music can break the facade of 3 minute pop instrumentation and whiny lyrics, and the melodies and harmonies only accentuate the experience, meaning you'll have to draw yourself in for the entire joy ride that Tool has planned. <br /> <br />The album goes over as less of a song by song affair and can be more attributed to the musical equivalent of reading a Grimm Brothers book.  The small tales that Tool tells will span over one or two songs, but all are meant to be seen as less songs and more experiences.  With \\"Vicarious\\", the band's first single from the album, they continue to push the boundaries by providing a 7 minute long song, something considered to be almost heretical by the radio industry.  Even further, the song's focus on providing an uninhibited look into society's need for violence and hatred on TV as a survival trait leads one back to the days of Aenima.  However, it is really the ambience of the album that is the star here.  While so many will quickly point out their disdain for the silence found in portions of the albums, it is a welcome venture into a more experimental version of what the band has offered in the past. <br /> <br />What is there to really be angered about with the ambience anyways?  Previous albums featured a lot of the same things, with songs like \\"(-) Ions\\", \\"Message to Harry Manback\\", and \\"Mantra\\".  These are simply presented as segways between telling the necessary story, to help create a mood.  For instance, the biggest instances on the album are \\"Wings of Marie Pt. 1\\" and \\"Lost Keys (Blame Hoffman)\\".  These provide a sort of backstory for the real song, which is more than welcome.  The entire epic \\"Wings of Marie\\", presented in two parts (Pt .1 and 10,000 Days) refers to the death of Maynard's mother, or more her life through the 27 years she lived with paralysis.  Some backstory had already been provided for this in \\"Judith\\" by A Perfect Circle, but the intense lyrical content and emotion behind \\"Wings of Marie\\" really shows off what the band does best:  presents a level of emotional grip that few other bands can provide.  Listening to the lyrics with the tone that Maynard sings with and inflects upon all the alliterations of words, one can only cry by the end of the song as he admits he may not have been the great son he wanted to be, but if any one person deserved to go to the Gates of Heaven, it was her.  \\"Lost Keys\\" is simply a prelude to \\"Rosetta Stoned\\" (obviously both songs make reference to their own respective intellectual ideals, like the creator of the drug 'acid' and the Rosetta stone of Egypt), in which a man is laid up in a hospital bed talking about his acid trip. <br /> <br />The overall tone of the album is laden with a sadness, as the band has called this their \\"blues\\" album.  Regardless, every song on this album holds some hard purpose to reach out beyond the confines of music and instead try to open people's eyes as a society.  \\"Right in Two\\" can be one of the most inspirational stories of all time, focusing on the angels of Heaven questioning why their Father, God, would provide Adam and Eve with free will, only to evolve into a race of beings willing to forge blades and clubs and kill each other.  It's easy to pick up once the lyrics kick in with \\"killing monkey, killing monkey\\", and many parts in the album will stick in one's mind long after the initial listen through.  Even \\"Wings of Marie\\", clocking in at almost 16 minutes between both parts, will seem much shorter after your fifth or sixth listen, but Tool breaks the importance of record labels to have an album full of 3 minute singles and, instead, provide an epic, a story, one of the last great possible album experiences of our time. <br /> <br />Musically, there is not much that can't be expected from Tool on display.  Notably, however, Justin Chancellor's bass work on the album is made more predominant, maybe due to the longing and wry melodies he pulls from the instrument this time around.  Adam Jones experimented with many different effects, and while his signature style of hammers and taps are on display with some truly inspirational volume control work and mix of light and heavy riffs, he has done things like channel Joe Walsh-like inspiration for a vox-solo on \\"Jambi\\".  Timing wise, the inspiration the band quoted from Meshuggah and Fantomas is evident throughout, while most people were expecting the influence to be purely on a heavy front.  The off-time signatures the band is famous for are more prominent than ever, meaning you'll have to work hard to find the rhythm of each song, but once you do, it's still a joy to be able to provide a better head-nod than your friends. <br /> <br />Regardless of what one may believe, this album is a crowning achievement and a masterpiece for the band all around.  Many may be turned off by the ambient use of some elements, but for those truly appreciative of music and willing to get over their fixation on the band needing to write more \\"Undertow\\"-like music (listen to \\"The Pot\\" for your answer on that one), you will find a constant array of musical arrangement that will move you like Beethoven.

But in all seriousness, the music is timeless and wonderful---and even though Ramones \\"Hits\\" compilations now outnumber actual Ramones albums five-to-one---if by some chance you don't already have any of the others, this one seems as good as any for the casual Ramones listener.

0670034711|5.0|Three in the morning, and she's on the bathroom floor of her country house, sobbing. And not for any obvious reason. Elizabeth Gilbert, at 31, jets around the globe, writing travel pieces for GQ. She's published three books, all well-received. She's got a loving husband, a city apartment and a country retreat, money in the bank, eight phone lines, lots of friends.<br /><br />So what's her problem?<br /><br />\\"I don't want this house. I don't want a baby. I don't want to be married.\\"<br /><br />These thoughts cycle and cycle. So do her sobs. Then Liz does something novel --- she starts to pray. Not in any formal way. She just...talks to God. She apologizes for getting in touch in the middle of the night and for being such a mess. But the thing is, she's in trouble: \\"I am in desperate need of help. I don't know what to do. I need an answer. Please tell me what to do. Please tell me what to do. Please tell me what to do...\\"<br /><br />She stops crying. She finds herself \\"surrounded by something I can only describe as a little pocket of silence.\\" And she hears a voice. Not God's voice. Her own. But coming from a wise, calm and compassionate place.<br /><br />The voice says: \\"Go back to bed, Liz.\\"<br /><br />It's the right advice. It's also the beginning on an ongoing conversation with God. Seven months later, she leaves her husband. Starts a passionate affair --- is there another kind? --- with the wrong guy. But the wrong guy has a Guru, and Liz goes with him one night to chant. And she walks home \\"feeling like the air could move through me, like I was clean linen fluttering on a clothesline.\\" Not long after that, she hears the Guru lecture: \\"Her words gave me chill bumps over my whole body.\\" The Guru, she learns, has an ashram in India. How soon can Liz get there?<br /><br />For a devastated woman, Liz has no trouble getting what she wants. She scores a book contract to pay for her trip --- the book contract for this very book. The idea is that she will take a year to indulge three fantasies: living in Italy and learning Italian, an extended visit to the Guru's ashram, apprenticeship to a Wise Man in Bali.<br /><br />Italy comes first. Liz has a pleasant time there, and her observations are amusing. But Italy is insubstantial --- it's just food, friendly people, architecture. India is where she's bound from the beginning, and it's where the reader wants to be as well. On New Year's Eve of 2004, we get there.<br /><br />Just as she divulges nothing about the troubles in her marriage, Elizabeth Gilbert obscures the identity of her Guru. To no point --- she's Gurumayi, or Swami Chidvilasananda. Some of you, I'm sure, have her CDs or have read her books. From my own experience, I can attest that's she's extremely impressive. Her chanting comes straight from her soul and goes straight to yours. And when, in the course of a talk, she says that \\"You are loved more than you can possibly know,\\" there is no way the blood doesn't rush to your heart and your eyes fill with tears.<br /><br />For all that, the section about the ashram is a story of struggle. The prize is Elizabeth Gilbert's soul --- the stakes couldn't be higher. Will God's love overcome her resistance, her fear, her insistence on a writer's critical voice? Can she endure the early morning chant that drives her crazy? Can she drop her bitterness about the past and forgive those who wronged her --- for that matter, can she forgive herself? And, finally, can she believe the ultimate: \\"God dwells within you, as you.\\"<br /><br />I was reading this section for some time before I realized: This is the most intelligent writing about the minute-to-minute search for God I have ever read. That's because Elizabeth Gilbert is like us: American, urban, no-nonsense smart, self-deprecating in her wit, sharp of eye and tongue. Hers is a trip we can take with her, can identify with. And we do. Well, I do --- and the result is a thriller a lot more compelling than The Da Vinci Code. Her stakesare our stakes. We want her to win big because we too want to know God. Or, at the very least, to grasp that God can be known.<br /><br />So it disturbs me not at all that, one blissful night, a writer published by Conde Nast hugs and kisses a tree. Or sits in a cave-like room all night, not praying. She no longer needs to: \\"I have become a prayer.\\" I'll even listen to her advice: \\"Keep searching....be sincere.\\"<br /><br />On to Bali. She finds love and sex --- and in that unusual order, too --- and a happy ending. Nice. But the climax of the book came earlier. Indeed, the value of the book was that hundred-page section on India. It is weird to recommend that you focus on a third of a book --- it's not like you can buy only a fraction of it --- but that third is such a rich meal you may not care.<br /><br />Om Namah Shivaya. \\"I honor the divinity that resides within me.\\" Elizabeth Gilbert certainly does.g than The Da Vinci Code. Her stakes are our stakes. We want her to win big because we too want to know God. Or, at the very least, to grasp that God can be known.  <br />  <br />So it disturbs me not at all that, one blissful night, a writer published by Conde Nast hugs and kisses a tree.

B000001FO4|5.0|This is the band's best album in my opinion. Tom Keifer has some great vocals. A very scratchy, yet unique sound. Great songs. If you're going to buy any of the band's cd's then buy this one!
B000002H6C|5.0|This albums is just as jaw-dropping now as it was when it was released almost two decades ago. This is Metallica's fourth full length album, and in my eyes their finest. Their music had evolved into some sort of proto jazz/thrash hellspawn. No bass is to be found, true enough. But there are guitars o' plenty, and they are majestic. Track upon track of epic thrash symphonies, furious metal perfection, and Bob Rock is nowhere to be found. This is indeed thinking man's metal; few bands could ever hope to measure up.
B000FFJ85I|1.0|Ok, I'll start by saying I'm quite a big fan of AFI. This is their 7th album release. I have all the 6 previous albums. I think the sound they made was quite unique - anthem-type hardcore punk. I respect hardcore punk, not new modern pop-punk like Good Charlotte and Angels and Airwaves for example. AFI's new album though, have dissolved into a branch of modern pop-punk junk. Emo kids will eat this up. With the poppy choruses, and the intelligent lyrics (that was sarcasm), old fans will be disappointed. If you want lyrics like \\"DON'T SPEAK MY NAME!\\", and 6 choruses of \\"Under the summer rain, I burned away\\" (in Summer Shudder) look no further. AFI has indeed, burned away. <br /> <br />AFI have weakened into a radio friendly band. Banal and predictable. Gone are the anthem days of \\"Now The World\\", \\"Silver and Cold\\" and \\"Days Of The Phoenix\\" to name a few. However, if you're a 13 year old emo kid who appreciates the 'profound' talent of Fall Out Boy then you'll love this generic album.

B00005JOFQ|5.0|What a completely pathetic review of Art (?). He said \\"colourised picture postcard views\\" well that name is Rodrigo Prieto. If the reviewer didn't know who he is... must find out...    But continues with \\"brief dialogue is totally unintelligable\\" again, the reviewer doesn't know either who wrote Brokeback Mountain and who adapted to screenplay - Annie Proulx and Larry McMurtry (a studying authority of the American West).  Characters aren't developed? Well he needs to see instead Sesame Street - That should please him!    But MORE THAN THAT, both Brokeback mountain, the clouds, and the sheep aren't only \\"landscape\\", but also reflects the moods of characters - the feelings, described through those natural elements. Ang Lee doesn't used words to capture the emotion. Poor reviewer that coudn't understand an easy message from the director/writers/producers/cinematographers...    Brokeback Mountain is the Art of filmmaking, the movie breeds the language of the true American rural people. Ang Lee made a very, very strong connection between emotion and art. That is not achieved by many. Praise must be give to all the actors involved, specially Heath Ledger. 5 STAR Movie - no less.

B000001DTM|5.0|Achtung Baby began the era where U2 went from earnest, socially-conscious Irishmen/Englishmen to \\"cool\\" rockstars who simply cared. They abandoned the mountain men clothes and bought some shades and leather. They left the desert, and put on dresses and makeup. Maybe one day we'll forgive them for that last part. <br /> <br />Achtung (Attention) Baby is U2's best album I've heard. The songs have more of an edge (no pun intended), and the album is more interesting than The Joshua Tree. <br /> <br />I'm hard to please when it comes to the idea of a \\"perfect album.\\" Even records I've given 5 stars to, have at least one dud. AB is no exception: I don't care for The Fly. But as a listener and lover of music, I know that this song suffers from relativity. It sounds sub-par because of the stellar company it's in. <br /> <br />One is not just U2's greatest song, but the greatest song of all time. Forget Smells Like Teen Spirit and Billie Jean. One is the best. No matter how many times I listen to it (which seems to be on average 5 times a week) I get chills all over again. It is never a chore to listen. <br /> <br />Achtung Baby is great. It would be even greater if it were remastered. In fact, U2 need to remaster all of their albums from the 80s and early 90s. Then, I wouldn't hesitate to pick up War, and to listen to The Joshua Tree more than I do.
B000CBSHK2|2.0|This CD is a big disappointment. Beth Orton is my \\"go-to\\" listen; I can listen to her songs in any mood, at any time. This CD has some well-written songs, but there are only two songs (the first, \\"Worms\\", and \\"Heartlandtruckstop\\") that burst out of the speakers the way Beth Orton songs can. The rest are all absolutely listenable but none of the songs has that \\"I must replay this song now\\" moment.<br /><br />I am used to Beth's songs possessing many random moments of beauty, that are partly caused by the spareness of production. This CD all the songs sound pleasntly even on the EQ band, but they mostly lack the punchy lyrics or compelling music that grabs you. For instance, I heard many of these songs over and over again on the radio, but none stood out the way \\"Stolen Car\\" did or \\"Mt. Washington\\" did.<br /><br />Get Daybreaker instead for your Beth Orton space in your record collection.
0812550706|5.0|In 1985, Orson Scott Card made his major debut with Ender's Game. It remains one of my favorite books after years of reading other books. I first read Ender's Game in my eighth grade English class. One of my best friends said he had read it and it was an amazing book, which was surprising. It turned out that he was right. It won the Hugo and Nebula Awards and many others, is being made into a movie, and has a substantial following.   <br /> <br />The book follows Ender \\"Andrew\\" Wiggin, childhood genius, his peers, adults, and more. I do not want to give anything away, because part of the novel's fun is accomplishment when you figure out what a term means or what is actually going on in the world Ender has been put into, but I'll tell you that the story is intricate and impressive. Because children are pure and fresh thinking, and because they have not been molded into anything yet, it is up to the government to train the brightest ones into war machines, so they can defeat the alien race called the \\"buggers.\\" The brightest children are sent to train in an isolated space station. Ender, as it turns out, is one of these kids.  <br /> <br />I was an apathetic reader until Ender's Game. Orson Scott Card puts you in the feet of a child genius, which undeniably made me feel good, and inspired me to read and write more frequently. His writing does not go out to impress, but it certainly does. People complain about vocabulary, as if that has a lot to do with someone's intelligence. The characters in Ender's Game have suitable vocabularies, and to complain about that is ridiculous. Card's writing is poignant and flowing. It is easy to read, hard to put down, and touching when you finally do put it down. The book is just all-in-all awesomeness. Escapism at its finest.  <br /> <br />There are some minor faults in Ender's Game, though they do not detract too much, they might even add to the experience, they just seem like technicalities. Firstly, I do not like the big deal Grafmakes about taking Ender to space. They suspect that he will be the messiah-esque figure, but do not immediately take him. No one else in the station is near his level, but they are reluctant to take him. Just the fact that they think he could be the one, is enough. He does not even have to be the one, as long as he is close. There are many kids in the station. They say his brother and sister tested out impossible when, compared to others in space, they were very suitable. They could have aided Ender well. They exceeded many in the station, especially when you read Ender's Shadow. That actually brings out another point. In Ender's Shadow, everyone wonders where Bean came from because he is such a genius. Everyone thinks that his parents must be geniuses and well known to breed such a child. A major motif in the novel is searching for his parents. For Ender, I wonder how Ender's parents made three genius children, one tame and weak (Valentine), one balanced (Ender), and one extreme and evil (Peter), but the parents are boring and unimportant. Even though Peter and Valentine are very gifted, I still wonder also how Locke and Demosthenes got so far in the political world. In addition, why are the adults so lacking? It seems so strange having such brilliant children at such a young age. Sure, it makes you feel good to be in the minds of these child geniuses, but it really does not make sense. Lastly, the descriptions of the battle room and battles are excessive at times. Still, these faults are not too great. I would give this book four and a half, but it is not possible. Anyway, these faults demonstrate how much I really care about the book to mind the faults. If it were a trashy book, I would not care enough to bother. <br /> <br />Ender's Game is a classic in all respects and must be read. I am a harsh reviewer, but I cannot deny this book's quality. I am off to read it again.  <br />
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Before watching Serenity I had never heard of the Firefly universe. Halfway through the movie, I hit pause and logged on to Amazon to see if there was more...and there was. After seeing Serenity, I am now purchasing the whole Firefly series.<br /><br />Serenity is character driven sci-fi that is light (in a good way) on special effects, and heavy on story. A great aspect of the movie is that you never know what is going to happen next.<br /><br />The crew of Serenity is filled with real people, with flaws, but they are very lovable. There is a degree of bickering between the crew, but it is done is a very believable way. It comes off as the arguments you had as a child with your siblings: you disagreed, but at the end of the day you still cared for one another, and had each other's back.<br /><br />Something not often mentioned in these reviews is the fact that the show's cast is well put together. Not only do they work well together, but each has a very unique screen presence that only fortifies the story.<br /><br />My heart is saddened, as a new fan to the Firefly universe, that this is the end. This show should never have been cancelled.<br /><br />If you are a sci-fi fan, checking out Serenity is a must.

B000E1ZBGS|4.0|When a coworker told me that a new version of Pride & Prejudice was in the works, I took interest.  She then said that Keira Knightley would be in it.  I innocently asked, \\"Who will she play?\\"  \\"Elizabeth, of course.\\"  \\"But,\\" I protested, \\"she's too pretty to play Elizabeth.\\" I was thinking that unless the screenwriter excises Darcy's offensive comments about Lizzie's looks, this casting choice would be unconvincing.  In the 1940 version (with Aldous Huxley as screenwriter), Darcy (Lawrence Olivier) says that he has no time to humor the middle classes, sparing Greer Garson the evaluation of being \\"tolerable, but not handsome enough...\\"<br /><br />This movie has many great qualities. It is far \\"earthier\\" than the A&E/BBC 1996 production, as swine roam both outside and inside the Bennet's house, and the characters look like they've worked up a good sweat at the country dances. I also like how much more tender Mr. Bennet's character is than in the book and other productions.  Granted this is an apocryphal character interpretation, but I really liked it just the same. Donald Sutherland's take on Mr. Bennet is one of his finest performances of my awareness. Instead of continuing to chide Mary that the other ladies need a chance to exhibit their musical talents, he comforts his sobbing daughter.  Another point that I liked is that the characters really look their age.  Though I love and still prefer the A&E/BBC production, all of the Bennet girls were played by grown-up women well into their twenties and beyond.  In this production, Lydia does look like a 15-year-old girl and Lizzie like a girl who's not yet one and twenty (with four younger sisters out, your Ladyship can hardly expect me to own my age).<br /><br />Due to time constraints, this movie didn't get the opportunity to really fine-tune character development and relationships. The A&E Adrain Lukis' Wickham was so dastardly charming, yet Lizzie's initial attraction to (Rupert Friend's) Wickham and later repulsion towards him was put on fast forward and barely developed due to the movie's two hour time frame. And the man who played Mr. Collins in the A&E production was brilliant--he apparently was cast because he was the only actor who could keep a straight face while saying some of \\"the most fatuous\\" lines Jane Austen ever penned. Also, Colin Firth is the hottest Darcy yet on film. Not to disparage Matthew Macfadyen, but Firth's Darcy is an impossible act to follow (though in his own right, Macfadyen did a good rendition).<br /><br />I enjoyed this movie and enthusiastically recommend it.  However, I still prefer all five hours of the 1996 version.as put on fast forward and barely developed due to the movie's two hour time frame.

B00006G8HX|4.0|When the superb sequel \\"Star Trek 2: The Wrath of Khan\\" ended with Spock dying and his casket being sent down to the newly made 'Genesis Planet' many fans wondered is this the end for the beloved Vulcan or was the final moment showing the casket on the planet merely a teaser of things to come.  Well, as it turns out it was merely a teaser for things to come, but that wasn't known for a little while after the movie was released which proved to be a brilliant marketing strategy by Paramount, keeping the resurrection of Spock under wraps until the third film was essentially finished and the trailer was released.  So once the trailer was released fans could hardly wait to see the next installment in this blossoming franchise, in hopes that their perished hero would rise from the dead to rejoin Captain Kirk and the rest of the Enterprise crew.  And believe me the wait was definitely worth it, as this latest movie did an excellent job of building on top of what was started in the second film. <br /> <br />\\"Star Trek 3: The Search for Spock\\" begins essentially where its predecessor left off.  The Genesis Planet has been created, Spock is thought to be dead, and the crew of the Enterprise is attempting to limp back to space dock so that the Enterprise can either be repaired or decommissioned.  Before the Enterprise leaves the Genesis Planet they allow David, the estranged son of Admiral Kirk (William Shatner) and the Vulcan Lt. Saavik (Robin Curtis) to remain on the planet to study the new life that has been created.  After reaching space dock the Enterprise receives word from Lt. Saavik that a life form has been found on the planet and it is that of a Vulcan boy, and coincedentally enough, Spock's casket is now empty prompting the crew to wonder has their friend somehow been resurrected by the Genesis effect.  However, getting back to the planet may prove more difficult than Kirk imagined, his close friend Dr. McCoy (DeForest Kelly) appears to be suffering from having Spock's soul transported into him before Spock died, Starfleet is forbidding Kirk to return to the planet, and to make matters even worse the Klingons have discovered the planet and are attempting to plunder it for themselves.  With Dr. McCoy losing his mind and his son and Lt. Saavik and possibly Spock in mortal danger from the Klingons, Kirk and the rest of the crew of the Enterprise must choose whether to defy Starfleet and return to the Genesis Planet or lose their friends and loved ones forever. <br /> <br />\\"Star Trek 3: The Search for Spock\\" as I stated earlier did an excellent job of continuing the story started in \\"Star Trek 2: The Wrath of Khan\\", also this movie is the only 'Star Trek' film that doesn't really work as a standalone movie, all of the others are basically self-contained.  The story was full of deeply emotional moments, involving Kirk and his sadness over losing Spock, and his concern over Dr. McCoy.  Though the story was fairly dramatic, the writers still managed to infuse some humor into the proceeding without it seeming to be forced or a cheap ploy to get people's attention.  The acting was all very well done, and this is thanks in no small part to the fact that most of the actors were very familiar with their characters at this point, and the fact that Leonard Nimoy (who played Spock) also directed the film, and showed a great eye for achieving cinematic gold.  This movie does an excellent job of tying off the loose ends left over from \\"Star Trek 2: The Wrath of Khan\\" and allowing the movies to branch out further from the TV series and become an entity of their own, which they clearly became with the outstanding \\"Star Trek 4: The Voyage Home\\" which would also be directed by Leonard Nimoy. <br /> <br />Overall, this film coupled with the previous sequel provides Star Trek fans with so much sci-fi goodness that they can almost completely erase the atrocity that was \\"Star Trek: The Motion Picture\\" from their minds.  \\"Star Trek 3: The Search for Spock\\" is a very solid entry into this franchise, but be warned you should view \\"Star Trek 2: The Wrath of Khan\\" before watching this movie so that you can fully appreciate what's going on in the storyline. <br /> <br />\\"Star Trek 3: The Search for Spock\\" is rated PG for violence and brief language.

0312305060|5.0|This book was one of the best books I have ever read.  Michael Cunningham writes so well and the book flows so nicely.  The combination of the three stories that are all different but have subtle characteristics that bring them together, makes this book enjoyable and interesting to read.  Cunnigham's use of the novel Mrs. Dalloway also makes this book more interesting.  Though I suggest you read Mrs. Dalloway before you read this because by reading Mrs. Dalloway, the Hours becomes easier to understand.  Also, I suggest reading the Hours before watching the movie.  The book explains things in more detail than the movie.
B0001US8EO|2.0|Wyatt Earp is an okay movie...but Quaid's performance as Doc Holliday is laughable and has put me off not only this movie but all Dennis Q's movies forever!   <br /> <br />Oh, and I have to mention-How long is this movie?!  <br /> <br />If you'd like to see a real movie about Wyatt Earp and Doc Holliday-See Tombstone!
1592401791|5.0|The other reviews cover how great this book is -- although it is over 300 pages without any photos.  This is disappointing because so many great studio photos exist.      If you can get a hold of an old copy of \\"The Beatles Recording Sessions\\" by Mark Lewisohn, you can open both books, read along in Emerick and see the photos taken in the very studios and sessions Emerick describes.  It also helps to have the Beatles CDs handy because Emerick points out many hidden gems in the recordings you'll want to hear immediately after reading about them.
B00003CXDV|5.0|This movie is scream-out-loud funny with sharp pokes at Star Trek and Trekkies. There are so many funny scenes that I won't spoil them for the viewers by describing them. But watch for the one of the ship leaving the space drydock. The dialog is just great too and every actor does a terrific job. Having a bad day? Put this in the VCR.
B0000A0DRY|5.0|Most of the members of Jefferson Airplane have always said that Jerry Garcia played on, sang on, named and produced SURREALISTIC PILLOW, facts denied by RCA's named producer Rick Jarrard and Airplane drummer Spencer Dryden. Hence, Garcia was never given producer's credit; but he was named as \\"spiritual advisor\\" to the album. As metaphysician to the acid-rock age, Dr. Garcia did a great job. SURREALISTIC PILLOW spawned not one but two classic anthems of the Summer of Love (for those of you too young to know, that would be 1967), \\"Somebody To Love\\" and \\"White Rabbit,\\" covers of songs originally sung by The Great Society. Thus, not only did Jefferson Airplane attain flight speed (their first album, JEFFERSON AIRPLANE TAKES OFF literally got them off the ground), but it ensured them a permanent place in the Rock pantheon as the definitive interpreters of \\"the San Francisco sound.\\"<br /><br />While SURREALISTIC PILLOW is not the prime example of the band's preferred overtly political, dense musical style (that would be their fourth album, CROWN OF CREATION), SURREALISTIC PILLOW is, far and away, their best work. A group with intense internal stresses, this album found the band in a fleeting moment of dynamic suspension. The Airplane would never sound so unified and yet so eclectic ever again. SURREALISTIC PILLOW has wandered, but not too far, from Jefferson Airplane's folk/blues/vocal harmony roots. Although they sing and play together, each member of the band has a distinctive sound, all of which mesh perfectly on this album.<br /><br />\\"She Has Funny Cars\\" opens the album with a jungle beat, wailing guitars, and offbeat lyrics, immediately followed by the anthematic \\"Somebody To Love\\" (written by Darby Slick but sung by Grace Slick). Grace's voice has been described by some as \\"steely\\" and by others as \\"a silken-sailed clipper ship,\\" and everyone is both right and wrong. The former I. Magnin model's powerful contralto both challenges and invites her bandmates  (and the listener) to keep pace, being all at once playful, petulant, demanding, ingenuous, and erotic.<br /><br />\\"My Best Friend\\" is a nice vocal harmony number that goes well with whatever everybody was smoking that long-ago summer; and \\"Today\\" and \\"Comin' Back To Me\\" are paeans to lost love, the former from the perspective of the leaving party, and the latter from the one left behind (and still tear-inducing).<br /><br />The oddly named \\"3/5 of a Mile in 10 Seconds\\" and \\"DCBA-25\\" are drug songs, pure and simple, from that innocently luminescent time where no harm was done to anyone, the consciousness expanded, and God was seen on a daily basis. Both songs presage the Airplane's emergent distinctive style, musically and thematically.<br /><br />\\"How Do You Feel\\" revisits the tenor of \\"My Best Friend,\\" to be followed by what many people consider the best song on the album, guitarist Jorma Kaukonen's brief (less than two minutes), beautiful, complex, finger-picking instrumental masterpiece, \\"Embryonic Journey.\\"<br /><br />The original album closes with the Lewis Carroll-inspired  cautionary drug anthem, \\"White Rabbit\\" and then singer Marty Balin's \\"Plastic Fantastic Lover,\\" which he claims to be about television, but transcends itself into a song about free love.<br /><br />The bonus tracks \\"In The Morning,\\" \\"JPP McStep B. Blues,\\" \\"Go To Her,\\" \\"Come Back Baby\\" and mono AM radio mixes of \\"White Rabbit\\" and \\"Somebody To Love\\" were all recorded during the SURREALISTIC PILLOW sessions, but never used.

0792839730|5.0|this is a fine movie about the post d-day raid into holland that was to end the war in 1944. as planed by field marshal montgomery the allies would drop behind the lines,take several bridges and hold them as ground forces race to link up and relieve the airborne troops. the problem was that it ment al the airborne troops would be out numbered and had to link up to live,and the ground forces had to make a dash down a one lane road to link up and the germans were waiting for them. really the problem was that \\"monty\\" as they called him was still smarting over not being given more power and he hated the fact that ike was in overall command. his ego and refusel to listen to his own people ment that everyone was afraid to say no to him. <br />       well enough of that lets get to the movie,which is one of the better epic war movies made. with a cast like this,james caan,sean connery,robert redford,michael caine,anthony hopkins,and many more this is one great war movie. besides the epic scope of the movie,it also takes time to give every actor so great little bits to play(i really like anthony hopkins packing for his jump,\\"pack my dinner jacket and golf clubs please!!) so if you like war movies this is one you need to have

B000E6ESL2|4.0|Stay startles the senses, challenges reason, and stretches the imagination. Director Marc Forster's film opens with a nighttime glimpse of a passenger car, smiling faces, and an engagement ring. Just as you piece together the happy event, it is obliterated by a horrendous automobile accident on the Brooklyn Bridge. In a flurry, the camera pans your view away from the dimly lit, rain soaked carnage to a young man standing, incomprehensively, over the wreckage. <br /> <br />Henry Letham (Ryan Gosling, in a genuinely riveting performance) is a college student and aspiring artist. He is the tragedy's sole survivor. Devastated, you sense his guilt and disappointment. Poised at the cusp of adulthood, Henry threatens to take his life in three days, at midnight, on his 21st birthday, just like one of his role models from a previous age. Seeking help from his therapist, Dr. Beth Levy (Janeane Garafolo, her usual quirky and effecive self), he finds Dr. Sam Foster (Ewan McGregor, plucky and intelligent), in her stead. Sam's concern and curiosity over Henry's suicidal predilections and uncanny ability to predict unusual weather phenomena incites him to investigate the young man's background and relationships. His inquiry intensifies into an obsession, which troubles Sam's live-in girlfriend, Lila Culpepper (Naomi Watts, handling yet another complex role expertly). She bears the brunt of his deteriorating mental condition. Lila, like Henry, is an artist, but also an art professor. Before becoming his lover, Lila was Sam's patient. In her darkest hour, when she thought she hated life so much that she included a backup razor to slit her wrists, Lila found enough beauty in the world to stay her hand. <br /> <br />At this point in the film, you may be wondering, \\"What is it with writer David Benieoff and these characters?\\"  <br /> <br />Many have interpreted Sam and Lila as refracted images of Henry's conglomerate personality, composites of his masculine and feminine self, desperately working together to save his life. After all, there was the time Lila called Sam, \\"Henry,\\" to Sam's dismay! However, reality in Stay is prismatic--lucid in its elements, and fleeting and dissonant in its construction.  Scenes morph deciduously into each other like the discordant brushstrokes of the impressionist artwork that is poignantly portrayed. Stay assuredly opens itself to subjective interpretation--especially over its sublime aspects. <br /> <br />There is much to recommend in this film. Fascinating incongruities and similarities in the characters' perceptions of each other distinguish it from other films in the genre. In one scene, for instance, Sam and Henry interact with the same sightless individual (Bob Hoskins, in studied excellence). Concomitantly, this person is Sam's colleague, Dr. Leon Patterson, but also Henry's father, Mr. Lethem, who Henry thinks he has murdered! In another scene, Sam and Henry confront each other in roiled fury, conversing in the same dialogue. <br /> <br />As in some recent films, viewers are exposed to reinforced, emblematic images. We see, for instance, multiple sets of human twins (even triplets) and other \\"doubles,\\" including an aquarium showcasing paired walruses. Also noteworthy is the geometric precision in featured architecture. A spiral staircase figures prominently in one scene. Reminiscent of the RNA helix, it is the place where Sam loses pace with Henry's fiancée, Athena (Elizabeth Reaser), whom he tracks to her college theater. <br /> <br />Sam's provocative visit to Henry's Long Island home, yields an otherworldly encounter with his mother, Mrs. Lethem (Kate Burton, eerily stoic), and her distrustful dog, which does not leave Sam unscathed! All this, however, contradicts the tragic family history, recounted by a disbelieving Sheriff Kennelly (Michael Gaston). Another memorable scene finds Henry popping into one of New York City's sleazy peep shows, where he voyeuristically peers through a bevy of undulating,leggy pole-dancers onto a flickering flat panel that randomly shuffles through a montage of his life's photos. <br /> <br />At the film's conclusion, we return to the controversial scene of Henry's automobile accident. Many characters re-appear as onlookers. The camera pans the wreckage and lingers briefly over the bodies, confirming a few suspicions. This time, Henry lies prone on the street, clearly dying. A nurse tends to him, helplessly. She is Lila Culpepper, who appears to Henry as the corporeal echo of Athena, his lost love. As his life fades, Lila can do no more for Henry than tearfully assent to his labored proposal of marriage. If Henry cannot \\"stay,\\" as Lila hopes, then something spiritual indeed has survived his mercurial trek between life and death. Ancient Hermetic and Egyptian adepts believed in Duat, the twilight netherworld journeyed by souls who, in life, travail to find gnosis, the knowledge needed to re-ascend heaven and achieve perfect Unity. Lila's promise of eternal love to Henry was his epiphany, the ultimate act of \\"beauty\\" in the world that willed Henry not to take his own life--even if he had to lose it. As the ancients knew it, love--not suicide, not self-sacrifice--was the promised path to salvation, the knowledge needed to free oneself from the lamentable cycle of corrupt material confinement. At the magical moment of Lila's consent, a recovered memory flashed across the mind of Dr. Sam Foster. It was a wondrous glimpse of a loving relationship, kindled in another dimension--some call it déjà vu. Having replaced Beth Levy as a qualified responder at the accident scene, Sam found himself at the right place, at the right time, to impulsively ask a heartbroken nurse, a lovely stranger and compatriot \\"guardian angel,\\" to join him for a cup of coffee, to help pass an unbearable night. Miraculously, Lila Culpepper consented and they departed together, embarked toward a better destiny. <br />
B00005ATQF|5.0|Full Metal Jacket has become a classic Vietnam film, usually ranked alongside Platoon and Apocalypse Now. What makes this film unique is how the director used it to portray human nature. The story begins at marine corps boot camp on Parris Island, where the new recruits come under the hellish direction of their drill instructor, gunnery sergeant Hartman. His commands and ranting bring humor to the story, but the recruits suffer trough basic training. This accounts for the first half of the movie, and the end of the first half is very shocking. The second half involves the recruits in Vietnam. This occurs before and during the Tet Offensive of 1968, and follows the marines in combat as they try to retake Hue City. Overall, the film can be said to describe the transformation of ordinary men into pure killers. This transformation is realized throughout the movie to the very last scene, making the film very dark, but extremely worthwile.
0393327655|1.0|Sam Harris has it in for \\"moderate christians.\\"  We are too tolerant of religions that preach violence, and it is because of us moderates that horrible things are happening in the world.<br /><br />Sam Harris does not get it.<br /><br />As long as there is doubt and unanswered questions there will be both mythology and religion.  Religion is merely the product of self doubt.  Because moderate christains are doubtful, they take care to avoid labelling another viewpoint as \\"wrong\\" and \\"unacceptable.\\"<br /><br />Harris goes into a winded diatribe about all the awful things that were done in the name of God. However, one might remember the Joseph Conrad saying \\"Ships aren't bad; it is the people in them.\\" The same is true for religion. Churches, synagogues, and mosques are not bad it is the people in them.
B000089RVX|5.0|This has GOT to be one of the best CD's ever recorded.  Evanescence is one of best bands out there...I've tried finding others in their genre and NONE even come close to their terrific sound. <br /> <br />The only problem I have is that they don't release new material fast enough for me! :)
B000ENWKN8|4.0|This cd is very different from his other ones but it's still good. There aren't that many soundbites here there are also a few songs using the acoustic guitar and a few of them have handclapping in them. A citar is used on 17 year locust which works out very nicely. The only real problem that I have is that there aren't that many songs and a couple of them are good but forgettable. If you only like Rob Zombie for his fast heavy songs then you might not like most of this cd but you should at least give it a chance, after all you wouldn't want the same artist coming out with album after album that sounds exactly the same, would you?
6305263248|5.0|Ronin is quite an interesting movie. It has a stellar cast including Jean Reno as Vincent, Robert De Niro as Sam, Stellan Skarsgard as Gregor, Natasha McElhorne as Dierdre and Sean Bean as Spence.They are all professionals and when there are car chases and gun fights then you can imagine what kind of profession they are in. Yes they are sort of bad guys, yet they are clever and cunning and each one has a specialty that the others lack.    Vincent is a French coordinator, Gregor a German electronics expert, Larry played by Skipp Sudduth is the driver, Spence a veteran from United Kingdom and Sam, played by the often talented De Niro was a strategist. They find themselves in a room together after being hired by the long haired Natasha McElhorne who doesn't want to reveal what is in the silver cases they need to steal and more importantly who her boss is.    This movie struck me as if it ran on the principals of prison movies. The code of honor in prisoners, trust and honor between thieves and criminals who form loyalties even though they are not supposed to trust anyone. In Ronin the simple job of ambushing a three car caravan on a quiet road in cozy Niece, France turns out to be a tangled mess of suspense. The car chases were insane, performed through extremly intricate little European roads at top speed providing for long intense moments. There was even a chase in a tunnel with cars going  in the wrong direction at full speed.    De Niro and Reno quickly end up trusting each other yet they are never sure of what the other person really does in their spare time as everything is top secret. The whole cast of characters was wonderful, fully of trickery and false personalities as the viewer got to travel through the route to ultimate truth and the result of the ambush.
055380457X|3.0|On the cover it says \\"Inside the hottest business, media...\\". I was expecting an inside story of Google. Instead, it was just made of information from other books, the news, and interviews. This book does give you a good brief history of the company though. If you haven't been following Google the past couple of years and didn't read/watch the news, it would be a good book.
B0002IVN9W|5.0|When writing these amateur reviews, one oftimes settles for more emotive reactions, such as, \\"Oh, my God.  This band changed my life.\\"  There are others writing reviews who fashion themselves as the next Lester Bangs or the next Greil Marcus, endeavoring to conjure up a list of smashing phases and laudatory cliche words to describe their current favorite group.  Oftimes the results are crap.  Let's face it, unless you carry a wealth of popular music  history in your threadbare pocket, you would be quite hard pressed to fully encapsulate the magic that is The Arcade Fire.  Oh sure, your friends might say, \\"Heh you liked Bright Eyes.  You'll love Arcade Fire.\\"  Perhaps.  But let us not paint all so-called 'indie bands' with the same proverbial brush stroke. <br /> There is a unique quality to the music of The Arcade Fire.  You may not fully appreciate this cd during an initial listen.  Yet, at subsequent listenings, you will find their mix of vocals and instramentation intoxicating. Play the music over and over and you will find it engages your sensibilities like few groups today.  As a side note, The Arcade Fire's performance at the Coachella Music and Arts Festival was incredibly dynamic.   <br />The members of the Arcade Fire are just damn good.
1400032717|5.0|I had heard rave reviews of this book from book lovers and psychologists alike.  Having worked with several autistic kids ranging widely in the spectrum, I could have said described how an autistic person thinks in differant situations.  But to read a book that's constantly from the perspective of the autistic mind was very shocking!  It certainly gives some insight as to how it might \\"feel\\" to think like an autistic individual.  I highly recommend this novel to anyone who enjoys reading unique works and to anyone seeking to understand autism.

B0007TKNL0|5.0|I give this movie 5 stars on one scene alone - the scene where Christine and the Phantom sing \\"The Point of No Return.\\"  That scene sizzled with so much emotional and passionate energy.   <br /> <br />Minnie Driver was awesome as Carlotta and Gerard Butler was tortured and (I thought) lovable as the Phantom.  Emmy Rossum was great as Christine...I do always wish she would choose the Phantom, but that's just me. :) <br /> <br />Definitely a keeper for any lover of romantic films.
0143036270|5.0|This translation of Meditations by Maxwell Staniforth (this is not the Gregory Hays translation that a lot of people are reviewing) is the best I've read. It reads clearly and simply, with no useless ornamentation to the text. Indeed, what I like about the Great Ideas series that this is a part of is its lack of extras--forewords and introductions and the like which, though often helpful, are usually written by people other than the author and sometimes set the reader up to completely misinterpret what they are about to read. This copy of Marcus Aurelius is only Marcus Aurelius, with perhaps a dozen or so explanatory footnotes sprinkled throughout.<br /><br />The book itself is well-known, content-wise. The titular meditations are bite-sized thoughts written down by Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius during his later years, as he reflected on his past while campaigning in the north. He was one of the greatest and most famous stoics who ever lived, and this book encapsulates his personal philosophy and manner of thought. His ideas are at once brilliant, challenging, and soothing, making this book good down-time reading and an excellent gift for a friend. I've read it several times, finding something new and moving every time.<br /><br />This is a very good edition of Meditations to have. The text is completely intact--not a selection--and the translation is clear and precise, but never boring. Maxwell Staniforth has done us all a great service with this translation of the last good emperor's journals.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B000FFJ85I|5.0|This collection of impassioned melodies may require a few spins to hook both new and long-devoted AFI fans.  The reason is that this album is even more textured than their last (Sing the Sorrow, 2003).  To their already full sound, AFI have added new dimensions that cannot be fully revealed or appreciated in a cursory listen.  It is clear that AFI have evolved again, but instead of shedding a skin they have added layers.   <br />Havok's lyrics traditionally explore themes of isolation and dismay, but these may be the most introspective and revealing yet.  There is a distinct vulnerability in them, which stings through even the most hardcore beats and aggressive screams. <br />Those familiar with AFI albums expect an introduction, but \\"Prelude 12/21\\" is simply stunning--the best one yet.  \\"Miss Murder\\" was definitely the right choice for Decemberunderground's first single; it is highly accessible because, on its most basic level, it is simply catchy.  (Try listening to it and not getting the \\"Hey Miss Murder can I\\" line stuck in your head.)    <br />AFI's eclectic influences also bleed through in many places; there are moments strikingly reminiscent of synthesized 80s rock (i.e. the finale of track 11, \\"37mm,\\" sounds distinctly Depeche Mode-ish), while \\"Kiss and Control\\" reminds me of Finch's \\"Bitemarks and Bloodstains,\\" if only in its eeriness.   <br />In Decemberunderground, AFI proves just how deftly they can navigate the fine line between producing something polished and new and maintaining the raw edginess that has won the band their legions of fans. <br />
B000FBGBPC|5.0|After waiting over a year, Three Days Grace's new album is finally out. My favorite track is \\"Never Too Late\\". If you loved their first album, you will love their second album as well. It's a little softer when compared to their debut, but it is still gold. Check it out.

B000BKVQTS|3.0|It is a light-hearted flick I thought was entertaining.  I wasn't bowled over by anyone's performance or the entire premise in general, but it was definitely worth a viewing. <br /> <br />I didn't think it was particularly appropriate for kids.  There is some violence (the hatchet in the valet's back, for one example).  <br /> <br />Overall, a fun rent.
B0000020C4|4.0|This is a fantastic recording with just a few faults. It's not a complete recording of the musical, a few cast members are under par, and there are a few moments where the sound is inadequate (Jenny Galloway's microphone malfunctions during \\"Master of the House,\\" a crash from backstage startles Hannah Chick as she performs \\"Castle on a Cloud,\\" and so on), but overall it's an excellent version of the celebrated musical. Instead of detailing only the major high and low points of the recording, I'll discuss the actors one by one. <br /> <br />Colm Wilkinson as Jean Valjean - Wilkinson, who originated the role of Valjean in London and on Broadway, is pretty much the best actor to play the role. His voice is a bit uneven sometimes, and he does tend to whisper, but when he does, it adds only intimacy to his performance. His performance in \\"Fantine's Death\\" is breathtaking, but of course his high point is \\"Bring Him Home.\\" It's a beautiful song, and his powerful, emotionally charged vocals do it admirable justice. <br /> <br />Philip Quast as Javert - Quast is, in my opinion, the definitive Javert. His powerful, deep voice is totally enthralling, and his rendition of \\"Stars\\" is enough to leave one breathless. He's such a talented actor, and while his performance on the CSR is a bit more perfected, the live aspect of his performance here makes it too good to miss. <br /> <br />Ruthie Henshall as Fantine - While Henshall injects a great volume of raw emotion into her performance, her singing isn't terrific. Her rough, throaty voice is a bit disconcerting, although her performance on \\"Lovely Ladies\\" is great. She sings \\"I Dreamed a Dream\\" with honesty and passion, but it's simply not enough to excuse the fact that her voice isn't very good. <br /> <br />Hannah Chick as Young Cosette - Chick really is very good. Her sweet, innocent voice makes the usually dull \\"Castle on a Cloud\\" worth listening to. She's not a showstopper, but she's cute and worth a listen. <br /> <br />JennyGalloway as Madame Thenardier - The audience on this recording obviously adores Galloway. Nearly every line she sings is met with laughter and cheers, and rightfully so. Galloway is incredibly skilled at portraying the comical, vulgar Madame Thenardier, and her tremendous, strong voice makes her one of my favorite Madame Thenardiers. <br /> <br />Alun Armstrong as Thenardier - Armstrong is definitely the best Thenardier I've heard. He has quite a bit of talent, and he performs the role with such a good-natured cheer. He's terrific and definitely worth a listen. <br /> <br />Adam Searles as Gavroche - Searles, thirteen at the time of this performance, is unforgettable as Gavroche. His voice is really cute, and he sings the role with such endearing charisma.  <br /> <br />Lea Salonga as Eponine - Salonga's strong accent takes a bit of getting used to, but her voice is strong and graceful, and her interpretation of \\"On My Own\\" is stunning. I have never been an Eponine fan, but Salonga adds such emotion to the role that I can't help but love her. As I said, her accent is annoying, but when you listen to it for a while, it becomes quite endearing. <br /> <br />Michael Ball as Marius - Ball's voice is absolutely angelic. He brings such class and charm to the role of Marius, and he's obviously a favorite of this CD's live audience. His performance on \\"Empty Chairs at Empty Tables\\" is heartbreaking, and overall he is not to be missed. Definitely my favorite Marius. <br /> <br />Michael Maguire as Enjolras - While Maguire tends to mess up on some high notes, it's understandable because this is a live show. His voice is strong and gallant, and he's a pretty good Enjolras. <br /> <br />Judy Kuhn as Cosette - Kuhn really is the only performer on this CD that I actively avoid listening to. She has such a prominent accent, but unlike that of Lea Salonga, it adds nothing to the songs--it only makes her annoying. She hits the notes she needs to hit, but the sound of her voice is pretty awful. <br /> <br />All in all, this is a great recording. If Rebecca Caine, the original London Cosette, had been substituted for Judy Kuhn, it'd be even better.
0307275639|5.0|I found the book Tuesdays with Morrie extremely thought provoking. It addressed a lot of big issues that our world constantly faces. I really liked this book because I could relate to it. Some of the advice that Morrie gave Mitch was what I really needed to hear. It gave me a new understanding and appreciation for life. I think anybody over the age of 12 would be able to comprehend and enjoy this book. Tuesdays with Morrie really challenges your views and beliefs. There was not anything in this book that I would change. The only thing I did not like was how it was so predictable. However, every time I read this book, I was anxious to learn a new life lesson from Morrie. I really felt like I was the one who was flying in to meet with Morrie, in his office, on Tuesdays, rather than Mitch.
B0000024RZ|4.0|bob has just his voice,guitar and harmonica on this one.its one his earlier albums.the first song is the best one as he fights the man .the second song\\"ballad of hollis brown\\" us utterly depressing as a starving man kills his starving family and then himself.\\"with god on our side\\" openly challeneges christianity.this was before,of course,he converted.\\"only a pawn in thier game\\" sticks it to the man again.then a pretty love song comes by called \\"boots of spanish leather\\".then theres a few more songs here and there for filler.this  is one of the early albums that got him his title as the voice of a generation.and after hearing it i would agree.
B000FFJ85I|2.0|Over a very good listen of this album, I  have to say that I am let down tremendously..let me explain...First of all..I dont even think these guys were in the same room when they recorded this album. I mean this album isnt even a \\"ROCK\\" record. It sounds like they sent each member in one by one to contribute whatever they had to contribute and let the producer just turn these songs into pieces of pop music. I am not gonna get all elitist but I DID see AFI back in 97 and have been a fan for like 10 years and loved them until June 6th. Now I just have to question their cred and their motives. Over the last ten years they have slowly changed their image from traditional cali-punk skate kids, to misfit worshipping rockers, to leaders of the new school death kids. I loved Black sails, and I loved all Hallows Eve, and I even love the art of drowning and most of sing the sorrow. But I just didnt fall in love with this record. While alot of the songs SOUND very slick and very catchy, they just dont rock. Even the ones that almost sound like they have a hardcore edge, get lost by the time you get to the chorus. Its very commercial, very poppy, and maybe too many studio tricks..Now I see why this album took so long to come out..Im sure everyone on here will disagree with my review, but I am just being honest, as a now former fan.
B000R209NY|4.0|Poseidon runs a surprisingly brisk 99 minutes, with 10 minutes reserved for credits. It cost Warner $160 million dollars to produce, which means that the film cost $900, 000 for every thirty seconds of footage. Wolfgang Petersen's original cut was 125 minutes before someone, somewhere ordered him to cut it down. Don't get me wrong, it's constantly going and the short running time matches the no-seconds-to-spare realism of a gradually sinking capsized ship. The set pieces the film has to offer are all nail-biting and intense, but I just felt that there wasn't enough of them.<br /><br />I'm not such a big fan of the original. I liked it as a kid but viewing it as an adult I'm turned-off by the soap opera drama and dated effects. Back in the early 70s this may well have been fine but perhaps such advances in movie effects is why remakes of these kind of movies are not so unnecessary. Though I don't really consider this a 'remake' as it is just another version of Paul Gallico's novel.<br /><br />The characters are all likable and even though the set-up and introductions are pretty quick, we get to know enough and grow attached to them before the big wave hits (no longer a tsunami) and what a set-piece that turns out to be! The initial capsizing of the ship is a brilliantly edited destruction derby in which many, many human lives meet violent deaths. If there would be just one thing the film has to offer it is plenty of dead bodies. But why not go one step further and show some really heavy gruesomeness? I would have liked that!<br /><br />The idiots (there are usually loads in disaster films) stay behind in the ballroom while a bunch of more sensible survivors decide to escape by going up (down) to the engine room and out through the propeller tubes. Only because everything is inverted, there are loads of obstacles, including a race-against-time in a very small and very cramped air vent. Not all of them make it!<br /><br />It's a shame that Poseidon didn't do better at the box office but it faced stiff competition in summer 2006. The worldwide grosses maxed out at $181 million, so it only just barely broke even. For some reason Poseidon has had a bad reputation, which is doesn't deserve. The theatrical cut, available here on this Blu Ray, is stripped-down and on the nose. A fleshed-out extended version might win over the doubters.<br /><br />The Blu Ray features a great 2.35:1 1080p picture and a DTS HD-MA soundtrack with plenty of extras.the box office but it faced stiff competition in summer 2006.

B000092Q4U|5.0|I consider this Lamb of God's third studio release (with the Burn the Priest album being their first).  I've owned this cd for a long time, but didn't decide to write a review until now.  This cd acts a nice bridge between the very raw New American Gospel and the more accessible Ashes of the Wake. <br />    Lamb of God guitarists Willie Adler and Mark Morton really shine here, presenting the listener with a diverse variety of riffs.  Drummer Chris Adler and bassist John Campbell always make solid deliveries and vocalist Randy Blythe screams, croaks, and growls his way through this 10 track, 38 minute cd. <br />    The opener, \\"Ruin\\", aside from being one of Lamb of God's best songs ever, really engages the listener to the mood and feel of the album.  \\"As the Palaces Burn\\" is a great follow-up, though a bit on the short side.  \\"11th Hour\\" is unique from the rest, and offers a blindlingly fast guitar-drum give and take towards the end of the song.  \\"For Your Malice\\" is slower with a chugging riff style, and manages to be very heavy and interesting.  \\"Blood Junkie\\" lyrically sounds like it belongs more on New American Gospel, and is a nice change-up.  The final track, \\"Vigil\\", is a very important song not just for the album but for the band's musical development.  It starts off sounding like it's going to be a ballad and explodes into typical Lamb of God style.  It builds until the end, and is probably the best constructed song on the album, ending it perfectly. <br />   Overall, this isn't as accessible as Ashes of the Wake, not as raw as the Burn the Priest album, and is very solid all-around.
0385504209|5.0|i couldnt stop  turning the pages with thus one.it was spectacular!basicly theres 2 people looking for a bit of irrefutable proof jesus was mortal and well liked but not a miracle man in the form of the \\"holy grail\\".what ends up happening is they delve deeper and deeper into the world of some secret society.they never really do say at the end.its chalked full of theology,but im educated in that respect and had no trouble following the book.jesus was a man.but the one god decided to perform miracles through and,of course,his son..im sure this book is gonna piss a lot of people off .i also think it was unwise for whoever to put this out both for thier health and for thier spiritual profile.its interesting to read but ultimately a ultra-let down.
B000FILW86|5.0|This new Cheap Trick CD is really amazing, very upbeat and full of great songs from start to finish. I can't help but think back over the years always looking forward to a new Cheap Trick recording to be released. I've spent 3/4 of my life loving this band's music and for them to put out something this great so many years into their career really shows something special.
B000EMGAGW|4.0|This is i would think this is there best album ever. <br />Sick Beats,Great lyrics <br />All that i want in a song and in an album <br />But some songs like put em in there place is kinda annoying after a while(the beat) <br />Overall this is a great album to buy
0385474547|4.0|I didn't give this book 5 stars because I think I wouldn't have enjoyed it so much if I had not read it in class with a framed discussion about the book and its relevence.  I'd reccommend that.  <br />Still, an incredible book.
B00026WU82|4.0|the opener was once again the best song on the album.it was the first bob dylan song i ever  heard................\\"like a rolling stone\\".its incredible!ive been a big time dylan fan ever since. a lot of the songs sound really a lot like the others.but theres a good love song.it seems bob always throws in one good love song just to keep on keepin on.this album actualy has 2!and the later part of the album is more drug induced i think.with songs like \\"highway 61 revisited \\" and \\"just like tom thimb blues\\".its good but hes done better.
B000FBGBPC|4.0|Just bought the album today and I'm on the second listening already. Favorite tracks include \\"its all over\\", \\"riot\\", and \\"never too late\\". The lyrics are simple but everyone can relate to them. Only complaint is that it's too short. Can't wait to see them on tour.
0895260131|4.0|In this new Age of Ignorance, when popular media purposefully keeps people in the dark, Robert Spencer's book flickers like a candle caught in the winds of biased criticism.  <br /> <br />True, Mr. Spencer's analysis is not the most complete.  Any discussion of the birth and spread of Islam must necessarily begin with the Arian controversy of the third, fourth, and fifth centuries that rocked the Christian world.  To those Christians who only half-heartedly accepted the condemnation of Arianism at Nicea and Constantinople, Islam offered a theologically more palatable alternative.  Hence, large parts of Northern Africa, Spain, and the Mideast, where Arianism was particularly strong, slowly converted to Islam.  The fact that Christians were reduced to second-class citizens with no rights against their Muslim overlords undoubtedly played a large part in those conversions as well. <br /> <br />The Muslim invasion of Europe that was stopped by Charles Martel at Tours, France is given too short a shrift in my opinion.  In addition, the Muslim attacks on Vienna, Austria in the 16th century and the Battle of Lepanto are merely glossed over.  This is unfortunate.  For only against the backdrop of these repeated attacks on Europe does the fight to free Southern France, Spain, and Portugual -- the Reconquista -- as well as the Crusades make any sense.  The fact that we can choose what laws we will be governed by rather than have a Muslim overlord impose Islamic law on us or the fact that we can build a church and worship as we want is only a \\"fact\\" because Charles Martel, El Cid, St. Bernard, Richard the Lionheart, Godfrey, Don Juan of Austria, Pope St. Pius V, and a host of other men and women risked their lives and fortunes to preserve all that they held dear.   <br /> <br />Nor does Mr. Spencer mention the other religions that have fought off Islam over the centuries.  For example, the rise of Sikhs in India in partial response to the forced conversions of Hindus by Muslims.  Or the massacre of many Jews who refused to convert or pay their taxes.   <br /> <br />Given the deafening silence by the mainstream media on these uncontestable historical facts, however, Mr. Spencer's book reads like a voice in the wilderness.
074322454X|5.0|I purchased this book in Normandy and began reading by Utah Beach.  Being in that location reading this very real book was amazing.  By the book's end of I found myself attached to the members of E company.  WWII has always been a fascination to me and this book gave me something that I haven't found in other places--it put me on the front lines.  Ambrose brought the members of E company to life in a way that I never expected.  I watched the series after reading the book and it was not the same.  The series gave me a clearer picture of what happened, but the book connected me to the men.  Because of this book I can honestly say I will never touch another WWII combat simulation.

B000F3TBIO|5.0|The Album is amazing. Each song is very catchy in its own unique way. It doesnt loop so great when you get to the end. It is a solid peice not really forcing you to go back and play it agian and again but you still will want to cuz it is good.
B00020HEL6|4.0|A reviewer below me has said that Renee's voice isnt great. I just have to say that if Renee isnt good, than there is no hope for other female singers out there. Renee was 15 when she recorded this album. Her music is similar to that of American Idol finalist John Stevens except Renee has a much better voice. Her voice is even better than fellow teeange music icon Joss Stone. This album has mostly covers, but i'm waiting for her next one which is going to be MAJOR. Renee's talent has been recognized and even though i dont genreally listen to Jazz/Blues (i got some Katie Melua songs and i didnt like them. I can just about tolerate Norah Jones), but Renee is an exception. Her voice is phenomenal and the arrangement on the CD is quite good. A must buy for all jazz/blues lovers.
0783229321|5.0|It's the undisputed heavyweight champ of frat-boy movies. Many erstwhile pretenders to the throne have come and gone (Porky's, Screwballs, Revenge of the Nerds to name but a few) but none of them have come close to matching this slice of genius from John Landis. Even today, many years after it first came out, Animal House still stands head and shoulders above the competition. Like its undoubted star - the late John Belushi, Animal House is loud, stupid, vulgar and more often than not: uproariously funny. As well as its influence on those who shamelessly copied the formula for their own efforts; the film's larger-than-life celebration of youthful excess also spawned a craze for drunken toga parties and food-fights in college campuses across America.  <br />Set in the early 1960s at the fictional Faber College, the film deals with the story of the debauched Delta Fraternity: a collection of drunken headcases, misfits and screw-ups for whom higher education is just something that gets in the way of partying and screwing girls.  <br />The plot itself is so simple a retarded five-year-old could follow it without much trouble. The big end of year parade is coming and the Dean doesn't want the Deltas to screw it up and embarrass him in front of the Mayor - so he sets out to get them thrown off campus by putting the Deltas on the mysterious `double-secret probation'. <br />To achieve his goal, Wormer enlists the help of the smarmy Omega fraternity. The Omegas are the antithesis of all that the fun lovin' Deltas cherish and hold dear to their drunken hearts. Headed by the sexually inadequate Greg Marmalard (`Shouldn't something be happening by now, Greg Honey?') and aided and abetted by sadistic General Patton wannabe, Doug Neidermeyer and the slimy Chip Diller, who joins the Omegas after a dodgy homoerotic initiation ceremony (an early appearance from Kevin Bacon). The Omegas are a classic collection of odious rich kids just begging to be taken down a peg or two.  <br />Predictably all this attention does is make the Deltas rise to new heights of depravity; shoplifting; shagging the Dean's wife (and the Mayor's daughter); and generally getting pissed-up and singing \\"Louie Louie\\" every five-minutes. By the end of the film, stupidity has ultimately triumphed over stuffy officialdom. The Deltas are reinstated and the Dean has been put firmly back in his place - but you don't really care about all that: being just an excuse to revel in the mindless carry-on perpetrated by the Deltas. <br />Chief architect of mayhem is the gleefully moronic \\"Bluto\\" Blutarsky (Belushi), a foul-mouthed drunken slob who leaves a trail of destruction in his considerable wake and is aided and abetted at every turn by his unhinged side-kick D-Day. His role is pretty much encapsulated in his first scene in the film as he sways drunkenly, belches and carelessly pisses all over the shoes of naive newcomers, Larry Kroger and Kent Dorfmann. However, perhaps Bluto's crowning moment is the rabble-rousing speech given to his fraternity brothers after they are finally bombed out of Faber. `Over? Did you say over? Nothing is over until we decide it is. Was it over when the Germans bombed Pearl Harbour - Hell no!' he rants in idiot fury. `...This could be the greatest night of our lives'. <br />Director John Landis makes no pretence of trying to create some kind of art-house flick for the culture set, or some cloying morality tale for middle America. Instead, the comedy in Animal House is painted in primary-colours and using only the broadest of brush-strokes. The film frequently crosses into bad taste territory in search of more puerile laughs. (The Mayor's daughter is only 13, for instance. Then there's campus stud, Otter pretending to be a dead girl's fiancee in order to score with her room-mate; or the trip to an all black roadhouse). There's also a typically odd-ball cameo appearance from evergreen movie-weirdo Donald Southerland as Jennings, the spliff-smoking English Professor who hates the stuff he teaches as much as the students do.  <br />Put quite simply, Animal House is a modern American classic. It's not John Landis's best film: American Werewolf In London and perennial student favourite The Blues Brothers were still to come, but it's a thousand times better than some of the travesties he has produced in more recent years.  <br />As Dean Wormer points out; `Fat drunk and stupid is no way to go through life son'. Watching Animal House, I'll be damned if it doesn't look like a lot of fun. <br /> <br />Landis is very fond of putting little in-gags into all of his movies. Perhaps his most well known is the way he manages to slip the phrase `See you next Wednesday' into virtually every flick (originally the title of a student film: it crops up as the name of the porno movie in American Werewolf, on a giant billboard in the Blues Brothers, and in Jamie Lee Curtis' apartment in Trading Places). Animal House is no exception to this - at the end of the film, Landis uses a series of freeze frames to tell what happens to the characters. Southern Belle, Babs it turns out, becomes a tour guide at Universal Studios. Lo and behold, at the end of the credits there's a plug for the tour with the message: `Just ask for Babs.' We're also informed that the psychopathic Niedermeyer is killed by his own troops in Vietnam. In the Landis directed segment of Twighlight Zone: The Movie, one of the soldiers complains that they should never have killed Lt. Niedermeyer. Sneaky. <br />
B000F3AAUW|5.0|So, this is the album that made me cross over to a person who buys hip hop. Mainstream appeal this definitely has, because even though I was familiar with alot of very intelligent hip hop I never actually went and bought hip hop CDs. But I couldn't pass on this one after listening to it. Of course, then I went and bought DangerDoom's Mouse and the Mask and now I think I'm on that proverbial slippery slope. But it's been fun so far.
B00005OAIE|4.0|I have a saying about John Mayer, that goes \\"I will see him in concert before I die!\\". I am holding myself to that. When I recieved the \\"Room for Squares\\" CD from a family member, I knew right away I'd be listening to it over a thousand times. Never did I know how much this CD meant to me. John Mayer's voice is good for anything, in the car, having dinner, dancing.. well okay maybe not ALL of his songs are danceable, but you get what I'm saying. <br /> <br />Despite the over-played songs like \\"Your Body Is A Wonderland\\" and \\"Why Georgia?\\", when I can listen to these songs during my own time, I am still in love with those songs. No matter how over-played they may be. John Mayer is an excellent musician, and has such a unique voice, it almost brings shivers when you listen to the sincerity of his voice. His lyrics have such a heartfelt meaning, and although some say that YBIAW is a very lame and unnecessary song, you can always enjoy the music behind it. <br /> <br />His follow up CD \\"Heavier Things\\" took a while to get used to because all of the songs were so similar, but in time he came around. He always does... for us! (haha.. play on words with the lyrics from \\"Not Myself\\".) If you are into the soothing, smokey sounding voice of a bluesy-guitar player.. you will absolutely love John Mayer!

I would recommend it to science fiction freaks who like the book 1984 by George Orwell. In order to get more out of the book you should discuss the topic with someone.
078322737X|5.0|Before he became best known as Mr Star Wars, there was only a young filmmaker called George Lucas, with just one critically acclaimed debut feature (THX: 1138) to his name. Despite his lack of box-office success and after several rejections, he managed to impress Universal studios enough to finally get his next project off the ground. It would be a low budget film based on his own teenage years called American Graffiti: a Rock 'n' Roll movie that would double as a kind of sociological study of the American mating ritual. Armed with a minuscule $750,000, a cast of relative unknowns, and a shooting schedule of just 28 days (filming almost entirely at night), Lucas went out and made a film that was to strike a particularly resonant chord with American audiences: becoming the sleeper hit of the summer.  <br />At it's core, American Graffiti is perhaps George Lucas' most personal film to date - dealing as it does with the themes of his own coming of age. In a BBC Omnibus special celebrating the release of the Star Wars: Special Edition, co-writers Gloria Katz and Willard Huyck pointed out that the central male characters draw not only on people he knew, but also mirrored the different facets of Lucas' own personality. On a deeper level, the film also explores his own longing for the lost innocence of his country: before the rude awakenings of Vietnam and Watergate soiled the American dream.  <br />As well as eliciting a sensational response from critics and audiences alike, Graffiti would garner a total of five Oscar nominations and went on to take over $55 million at the box-office (rising to $117 million when it came out on video) - making it the most profitable film in Hollywood history. Perhaps most important of all: after seeing a screening of American Graffiti Alan Ladd Jnr, a development executive at 20th Century Fox, was impressed enough to give Lucas the money to develop the script for Star Wars. This was despite confessing to George that he didn't really understand what it was about. As Lucas describes it, Ladd told him: `I don't understand this movie, but I trust you and I think you're a talented guy... I'm investing in you.' <br />Set on the last night of summer 1962 - a mythic time of pre-Vietnam innocence, Graffiti is an incredibly simple film, dealing with a group of teenagers' coming of age in a small town. Largely created in the editing room after shooting was completed, American Graffiti doesn't really follow the traditional three-act framework of most movies, choosing instead to take the (at the time) novel step of intertwining several different unrelated stories into a documentary-style narrative.  <br />The action itself is propelled along by a constant background of period music that blares out from car radios: broken up sporadically by the manic exhortations of the howling, prowling pirate DJ: Wolfman Jack. The music used perfectly underscored all of the major events in the film, each moment having an appropriate soundtrack. Along the way Lucas managed to capture the arcane rituals and obsessions of American youth; the simple pleasures of Rock 'n' Roll, drive-ins, cruising the strip and making-out with a girl on the back seat. <br />After completing the editing, Lucas handed the finished film over to the studio bosses at Universal who expressed almost total bemusement at this strange little film - even after an enthusiastic response from a test audiences. There was talk of changes and cuts to be made before they would consent to the film's release. This attitude enraged Producer, Francis Ford Coppola, who got into a furious shouting match with one executive in the lobby of the theatre and ended up demanding to buy the rights back and take it to another distributor. Eventually the decision was taken out of both his and Lucas' hands when Universal went ahead with re-cutting the film without permission. A similar situation had arisen with THX: 1138 and the experience left him bitterly disappointed with the machinations of the Hollywood studio system.  <br />As a footnote to this disgraceful episode, the success of Star Wars allowed Lucas to go back and restore both films back to the way he originally intended. Today, it's with a great deal of satisfaction that he declares: \\"those mutilated versions don't exist anymore.\\" <br /> <br />THE STORY <br />The film opens at Mel's Drive-in, the local teen hangout and focal point of the movie. It's here the main characters gather to begin their last night together to the strains of `Rock Around The Clock'; there we find Steve (Ron Howard) preparing to leave town and go to college along with Curt (Richard Dreyfuss) who is unsure whether he still wants to go.   <br />As the night begins, Steve attempts to break up with his girlfriend Laurie (Cindy Williams): giving her the old \\"Seeing other people will only make our relationship stronger\\" line. As you might expect, she is less than enthusiastic about the idea and storms off. Steve also decides to leave his beloved car in the hands of his amiable but nerdy mate, Terry the Toad (Charlie Martin Smith) while local High school dropout: John Milner (Paul Le Mat) a brooding James Dean type, appears - doomed to be left behind by yet another generation of friends. As the night's cruising gets underway, we learn that there is a new hot-shot driver in town looking to challenge Milner to a race. Meanwhile Curt sees the woman of his dreams: a mysterious blonde cruising in a white T-Bird (Suzanne Sommers). <br /> After unsuccessfully trying to impress a car-load of girls, John finds himself palmed off with Carol (McKenzie Phillips), a bratty 13 year old who he ends up liking despite himself. More by accident than design, Debbie (Candy Clark), gets picked-up by Terry the Toad who is out driving in Steve's Chevy. In an effort to impress her he tries to buy some booze and ends up becoming involved in a hold-up. After taking her to the local make-out spot - he also manages to get Steve's car stolen. <br /> Still chasing his mystery blonde, Curt manages to fall foul of local toughs The Pharaohs(`That's FAY-rows'). Against his better judgement he allows himself to be persuaded into joining them for a night of petty delinquency - culminating in the separation of a police car from it's rear-axle. <br />Still smarting from her argument with Steve; Laurie hooks up with Bob Falfa (Harrison Ford: a role not a million light-years away from a certain cocky space pirate we all know and love); who is in town to challenge John Milner. After an exchange of insults the cars make their way out to Paradise Road for the final climactic face-off between Milner and the sneering Falfa. This segment also contains the coolest scene in the entire film - the two cars pulling up to the start-line at dawn to sound of Booker-T and the MG's before tearing off, leaving a cloud of smoke and burning rubber on the two-lane black-top. The race ends in an almost fatal crash (inspired by Lucas' own brush with death in a car accident) just as Falfa is on the verge of beating John.  <br />With the night finally over, our unlikely band of heroes meet up for the last time at the airport where everyone says their goodbyes. Curt is at last leaving, while Steve has decided to remain behind. As the plane takes-off we learn what the future holds: Curt becoming a writer; Steve marrying Laurie and staying in town; Terry dying in Vietnam and John killed in a road accident. <br /> <br />THE CAR'S THE STAR <br />As you might expect, the real stars of American Graffiti are the gorgeous cars that fill nearly every frame. From Milner's chopped yellow '32 Ford (`...what's that s'posed to be? Sort of a cross between piss-yellow and puke green, aint it?' taunts a derisive Falfa) to the mean, low-slung Mercury Lead-Sled driven by the Pharaohs. This film is quite simply a car-nut's dream, crammed with acres of gleaming chrome. The end result is that, watching American Graffiti you can't help but be drawn into it's colourful world of fast-food hamburgers, cruising and the ubiquitous Wolfman Jack - which to your average non-US audience at least, was every bit as alien as Star Wars would be four years later. The real strength of any film is in making you feel close with to the characters in it, and Graffiti does this in spades. You become so immersed in their world; into their hopes, dreams and fears that; after the more-or-less cheery events that have taken place beforehand - the sucker-punch ending, where we discover the respective fates of all involved, comes as quite shock. On this evidence it's a real shame that George Lucas would quit directing after just one more film, a story set a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away...  <br />
B00005JOSU|5.0|This is one of those movies that should not be analyzed...just enjoyed.  What a beautiful love story.  I saw a sneak preview tonight and I was moved to tears.   <br /> <br />I heard other people like John Q. Public rant and rave about the movie.  Same thing.  Hatred for Bullock/Reeves.  Don't let the naysayers stop you if you want to see a really good love story. <br /> <br />By the say...Ebert and Roeper already gave it two thumbs up.
B00006M183|5.0|Sure there 2000 album was alright but I think it is overrated and this one underrated I actually love this album. There is some crap like bushleager (I hate him two that song just aint great) but over all you got some great stuff here. I have listened to all there albums getting ready for there new one and there really all good this is no exception but if your a new fan VS is the best.
B0009S2T0M|5.0|I decided to watch this film because of the suggestion of a friend and I must confess that initially I felt that it would be a vain attempt to understand another Korean movie. I was very wrong! The film is a terrific adventure, full of surprises, with an excellent story and superb acting! The Korean cinema has definitely some new tricks to show and the story itself is an acrobatics on the edge of human feelings. Love, hate, thirst for revenge, are taking turns under a fine directing touch and a trully marvellous music. This is the best and most enigmatic thriller I have seen in the last few years! Be prepared for some very hard scenes indeed and see the anger making full circles, passing from all the extreme situations!

B000EWBKM6|5.0|If I had to decribe the series finale of Will & Grace in one word it would be --Spectacular-- It was the Finale of ALL Finales. W&G has always touched me somewhere deep in my heart. This show is \\"Unforgettable\\". Leading me to my next point. <br /> <br />Jack and Karen's Duet of Unforgettable was truly amazing! I loved the song, their voices, and that look we saw when the song finished with: \\"Unforgettable too\\". That look touched me. And the fact that they were living together was really cool. <br /> <br />But Will and Grace were not. Some people think that the 20 year freeze-out was stupid, and impossible. It's not. It happens all the time. And the point was that no matter how long you stay apart from your soul-mate, you'll find that you can't live without them. For eight long years I have loved this show. I hope you do too. I loved the Finale the most. <br /> <br />In honor of eight years of the best show on Televison, I have but one thing to say: \\"Goodnight, Gracie, goodnight.\\" <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B00005Y7AW|5.0|1. Cigarettes and Chocolate Milk 9/10 - very clever lyrics <br />2. Greek Song - 7/10 - didn't like this one much <br />3. Poses 10/10 - one of the most sincere songs I've ever heard <br />4. Shadows - 8/10 - this one took a while for me to stomach <br />5. California - 7/10 -I never quite got what all the hype was about <br />6. The Tower of Learning - 3/10 - should have omitted this one from the album <br />7. Grey Gardens - 10/10 -found the 'Tadzio' reference both strange and enchanting <br />8. Rebel Prince - 10/10 - Hit the replay button a million times on this one <br />9. The Consort - 11/10 - the kind of song that makes adult men cry <br />10. One Man Guy - 7/10 - obviously just a 'filler' song <br />11. Evil Angel - 10/10 - this one made me think of the 'dark' ages and gargoyles and vampires, yet it's such a morbidly serene song.  <br />12. In a Graveyard - 10/10 - touching and sad <br />13. Cigarettes and Choclate Milk - 9.5/10 - nicely done, upbeat version of the original song <br /> <br />I must admit this album took a whole year to grow on me. Beside Poses and Cigarettes and chocolate milk, I didn't listen to the other songs for months because I couldn't stand them...now you can't get me to stop listening to this album. Went to one of his concerts a few months ago and he is entertaining and human. What a great performer!

B00006L7XQ|5.0|I could go on and on, but don't listen to me.  Listen to this album.  Mr Cash's take on Hurt is worth it all by itself.  What Trent Reznor had to scream himself raw to get, Johnny Cash does with just a simple guitar and piano line and the ocean-deep sorrow and authority in his voice.  Watch the video too - quite possibly the best music video ever.  In fact, it pains me to even have to call it a music video.  It will break your heart.
B000FFJ85I|5.0|To many \\"so called\\" fans are saying that AFI are sell outs. Just because u dont like the cd doesnt mean that is sucks or that the are sell outs. This cd is actually good if you actually listen to what the lyrics. By signing a record deal to a big label they are just trying to spread their message.  <br /> <br />Anyone who likes AFI will understand their transitions and probably like this cd. I recomend this cd to real punks, not the ones that follow everybody's opinions of whats \\"punk\\" and whats \\"not\\".
B000F3AAUW|5.0|insanely good album. One of the best collaborative albums of the year! Every track entertains a different emotion and feeling. It's almost an outkast type of feeling but not quite. It's a really fun, twisted, entertaining album! <br />--Sara
B00000E2QI|5.0|This is truly a masterwork recording, with no room left for error. Excellence especially on the parts of the soprano and counter-tenor. Enunciation of the lyrics is clear, and the CD comes with full libretto, translated into a number of languages. An absolutely stunning rendition of Orff's work.
B000F1IQN2|3.0|I wanted very much to like this film.  As a rule, I'm a Spielberg fan and even though I feel he has slipped considerably from his 70's and 80's heyday, I still consider him a very talented individual and a genuine craftsman.  First and foremost, the title is misleading.  Though the killing of the Israeli athletes at the hands of Palestine terrorists during the 1972 Munich Olympics is, indeed, the catalyst for everything that transpires in the film, it's not actually about that grim episode in modern history.  The movie is based on a book by George Jonas entitled \\"Vengeance\\" and that certainly would have been a far more descriptive if less marketable and powerful title.  The film is overlong and Eric Bana is dull as dishwater as Avner, the Mossad agent heading the Israeli counter-terrorist team in its retaliation efforts against the Palestine forces responsible for the massacre of the athletes.  The action sequences are very exciting and well done with the Spielberg's tension building trademark in full evidence, however, the rest of the film is scattered, the narrative a bit convoluted (especially the rapid fire sub-titles and I'm a fast reader) confusing and the constant change from location to location without any indication leaves the viewer to guess just where exactly they were.  Half of the time, I had to guess just where exactly they were:  Paris, NY, Beirut, Rome, Tel Aviv, etc?  I'm not here to engage in, debate over or doubt the veracity of that which is depicted in the film nor the morality tale that weaves through it; I'll leave that to the political analysts, historians, theologians and Jewish scholars.  My gripe deals exclusively with the artistic aspects of the film.  Is the film good?  It is.  Is it great?  Hardly and certainly not an Academy Award contender.  Also, can anyone explain to me why Spielberg chose to depict the epic final showdown between the terrorists and police at the airport in Munich as an image running through Avner's head as he mechanically and seemingly brutality has sex with his wife?  Shot mostly in slow-motion with an Arabic tinged, electronic score floating high above, it reeked of manipulative melodrama.  First and foremost, Avner was not there, so how could this brutal moment be running through his mind?  Incidentally, it's the second time that happens, the first being the initial massacre in the Olympic village. In the end, I just didn't give a darn about any of these people (save for the athletes) and that to me is the ultimate sign of films impact; it's ability to convey the plight, horror, joy, hope (or whatever other emotion) of its characters.  For all I cared, Avner and company could have retired to Boca and opened a video rental store or died martyrs for their cause.  Either way, it would have made no difference to me.  Don't get me wrong, I still think the film is worth watching because the good moments are, in fact, very good but just don't expect great cinema because regardless of the media and critics has lead you to believe, it's not.  As far as I'm concerned this film did not belong in the same exalted company as Brokeback Mountain, Capote, Good Night and Good Luck and not even Crash, which is not as good as the other three, but works far better as an emotional experience than Munich ever does.  The Constant Gardener was a far superior film and should have taken Munich's place as a Best Picture nominee.
B000002J1U|5.0|Just because Zeppelin was under-appreciated prior to IV it doesn't mean their prior albums should go un-noticed.  This album has songs such as Tangerine (prominently featured in the film Almost Famous) and That's the Way which are two of the band's greatest acoustic songs and the album starts off with Immigrant Song which is one of their best hard rock songs ever (I only say \\"one of their\\" b/c I've gotta leave room for Kashmir and Communication Breakdown not to mention many of their other greats).  For those who claim not to really like Zeppelin they should give this a try 'cause it's got a classic Zeppelin feel but with a unique twist.
B00009P1MP|5.0|The term \\"miss american pie\\" for the song, Mr. Mclean says he created. It sybolizes the american way of life as we knew it. <br /> <br />so \\"bye bye miss american pie\\" is supposed to signify the end of things as we knew it. <br /> <br />Also its been strongly sugested that the nickname of the Beechcraft Bonanza, serial number N3794N, that carried them to their deaths, and thats death(s) BTW, Buddy Holly isnt the only person who died in that crash you know. anyway, Its been strongly sugested that planes nickname was \\"American Pie\\" but there has never been any proof to back that up, the plane had no registered \\"name\\" <br /> <br />Google it, you will get alot of usefull info. <br />I hardly think Mr. Mclean is insulting anyone, I think your alittle sensitive.
B000F8O35U|5.0|To those who mentioned it before regarding it's lack of \\"Platinum Edition\\" on the cover, the actual Disney store website titles it as a Platinum Edition even though the cover does not appear to say it. It also comes with lithographs and/or plush toys when ordering it through them, not sure if it's the same for it's general release everywhere. Hope that answered any questions.
B00005JNJV|5.0|It has been said that a work of art tells us more about the artist than the subject matter in the art.  This is particularly true in stories about comic book characters.  I feel privileged to have lived in a time when so many good \\"superhero\\" movies have been made.<br /><br />I enjoy morality plays, stories that are thinly veiled formulas for discussing uncommon ideals and moral questions.  As I get older, I enjoy fewer things, but I still enjoy a moral tale.  It seems a little bit ironic that we seem to be able to swallow sweeping moral discussions more in animated, operatic, or superhero features.  In TV we've constantly had morality plays in the many incarnations of \\"Law & Order\\", \\"Star Trek\\", & many other shows.<br /><br />The movie starts off by graying the lines between good & evil and vigilantism & idealism.  The main characters are people with primary personas different than their alternate identity.  We hear the advice of Liam Neeson's character, not knowing whether to champion him or be suspicious - a writing choice that respects the intelligence of the moviegoer.<br /><br />The movie explores the long running \\"Batman\\" question of:  What separates a vigilante from a righteous avenger?  When is a person simply a facist by taking justice into their own hands?<br /><br />The movie also explores the important question of:  How do you deal with the possibility that you may have been a contributing factor to the death of someone you love?  The movie does not \\"answer\\" either of these questions; but rather shows characters trying to survive in the aftermath.<br /><br />I love this movie because it promotes these, and many other, ideals:<br /><br />1.  Never give up on the people close to you.  Seriously, never.  (Or as Michael Caine says, \\"Nevah!\\")<br /><br />2.  Why do we fall sir?  So that we can learn to pick ourselves up.<br /><br />3.  People need dramatic examples to shake them out of apathy.  People need someone to rattle the cages.<br /><br />4.  Its not who you are \\"underneath\\" that matters.  It's what you do that defines you.<br /><br />I really appreciate the intelligence and creative force of Christopher Dolan & David Goyer's caring screenplay.  This movie packs a great emotional punch, on par with Spiderman 2, another great movie.<br /><br />The title of this review is from a line in the film where Batman's father lets young Bruce know things will be alright, and the father will stand beside his son in the midst of all fears, even death.  \\"It's okay, it's okay.\\"defines you.

074322454X|5.0|The novel \\"Band of Brothers\\" by Stephen E. Ambrosse was a well thought out, entertaining read. The author does a great job explaining the battlefield front in excruciating detail. He also states the close relationship between the regiment and how they bonded very well. The author also incorporates the troops foreshadowing of what the battle will be like in the future. My favorite part of the story however was the detail of the conditioning and training each of the soldiers hasd to do for the war. The book was a valuable and facinating record about how the military was back then. It gave readers a first hand experience of the battlefield and taught you to make prdictions on what your inner premonitions tell you what will happen next. I really enjoyed this novel. I would recommend it to all readers.
1594200823|5.0|As a fellow back-to-nature-seeking eater and a food marketing insider, I can speak with certainty that Michael Pollan was right on the mark in every way.  I was captivated how Pollan eloquently drove the analysis of our food decisions to new enlightened depths.  Without a word of redundancy, Pollan thoughtfully and accessibly explained the fine subtleties while giving an overview to our food decisions and the food industry, in general.  No doubt, \\"The Omnivore's Dilemma\\" is one of the best books that I have read.
B000F3UAFC|5.0|The lovely Mrs. Erlynne has a problem. Spurned by all the society ladies, for discreetly servicing their husbands, she can no longer afford to spend her days living in New York as the \\"woman of ill repute.\\" Suddenly she finds herself an outcast and penniless, so she decides to travel to the Amalfi Coast of Italy, where she hopes to squeeze some cash out of some fresh prey.     She sets herself on the young newlyweds Robert and Meg Windermere (Mark Umbers and Scarlett Johansson) and in the process; she hopes to find herself a new man. But Mrs. Erlynne also holds a secret, a secret that if made known, will threaten to destroy the young couple's marriage.  Robert doesn't want his wife's peace disturbed and doesn't want her to know about the secret; yet Mrs. Erlynne takes advantage of the situation, after all, she desperately needs someone - preferably an aristocrat to keep her in the lifestyle to which she has become accustomed.     Neither Robert nor Mrs. Erlynne, however, have reckoned on the vituperative nature of the Italian aristocracy. Amalfi is a hotbed of idol gossip, with the elegantly rich entertaining themselves by spying on each other, soaking up all the scandal wherever they can find it. Almost instantly, conjecture becomes facts. Mr. Windermere's clandestine meetings with Mrs. Erlynne are quickly mistaken for a tawdry affair. The fire flares when Meg finds check stubs paid to Mrs. Erlynne in her husband's desk.    Word quickly gets around, especially with a woman such as Mrs. Erlynne and her past threatens to catch up with her The only person who doesn't judge her is the lovable and kindhearted - and very rich - Tuppy, a bachelor who yearns to marry his match. Meanwhile, the caddish Lord Darlington (Stephen Campbell Moore) is courting the innocent Meg, and she's quite enamored of him.     Everyone is soon immersed in a maelstrom of illicit liaisons and racy sexual politics. Meg is convinced her new husband is having an affair, whilst Mrs. Ermine is fraught with confusion - a born outsider, marriage has never been for her, yet she's getting a little too old to be constantly branded as such a \\"loose\\" woman. In A Good Woman the wealthy are sarcastic, bitter, witty and conniving just as much as they are innocent, emotional, regretful and honest.     Based on Oscar Wilde's Lady Windermere's Fan, director Mike Barker does a fabulous job of drawing the Wilde social satire out of the drawing room, and opening up the play to Italy in the 1930's and incorporating some of the most beautiful and sparkling Riviera vistas as a backdrop, The production design is unsurpassed - the film is lush, exotic and absolutely gorgeous to watch, there's never a scene or an image wasted.     The acting is also strong. Hunt beautifully captures, Mrs. Erlynne's vulnerability and pain - she's a damaged and lonely woman, who obviously loves money and the sort of lifestyle it can bring, but she's also a realist and doesn't hesitate to play the shameless vamp with a knack for insinuating herself into the beds and checkbook registers of men who should know better.    Tom Wilkinson absolutely nails the very wealthy but lonely Tuppy with the required tragicomic pitch that brings forth a great deal of self-effacing charm. And of course the beautiful Scarlet is extremely good here and manages to seem naïve and vulnerable without tipping into melodramatics.     Oscar Wilde liked men with a future and women with a past. In a Good Woman he wouldn't be disappointed, as the film is full of colorful and endlessly pithy types who seek to escape their past mistakes, yet seem to have a real love for life.

B000286RKW|5.0|Goodfellas  Movie Grade: A    \\"Goodfellas\\", director Martin Scorsese's masterpiece, based on the book, Wiseguy by Nicolas Pileggi,the co-writer, explores the criminal life like no other film. It is the story of Henry Hill (Ray Liotta), a half-Irish, half-Italian gangster who had been working for the mob since he was a teenager. As he grows older, he becomes part of a group, with his partners and friends, Jimmy \\"the Gent\\" Conway (Robert De Niro) and Tommy Devito (Joe Pesci). This group is kept under close surveillance by crime boss, Paulie (Paul Sorvino).    With a runtime of over two hours, \\"Goodfellas\\" is an epic film. It is an unforgettable journey, spanning three decades of life in the mafia. Music from the outstanding soundtrack is brilliantly used for transition throughout the film. Over the course, we are also introduced to several compelling characters.        These characters, especially Henry, Jimmy, and Tommy, are depicted with enormous complexity, whereas in a lesser film they would be simple caricatures of themselves. Scorsese and Pileggi truly understand these men and really humanize their characters. This is also due to the film's stellar cast.  Ray Liotta, with his expressions, pauses, and forced laughter conveys in his character deep guilt for the consequences of the life he leads. He supresses his own emotions when he experiences acts of violence or when women question what exactly he does for a living. De Niro is also great as Jimmy. He has an avuncular way about him and although he is not in much of the film, he has a strong presence.    Even more extreme characters like Tommy (Joe Pesci) are given depth. He is not portrayed as simply a gun crazy madman, but as a man who feels a constant need to demonstrate his power, using violence to rid himself of his insecurity. His insecurity is introduced subtly in an early scene.In the famous restaurant scene, after telling a story, Tommy asks Henry what he meant when he said he was \\"funny\\". Even though heis kidding with him we can tell that deep down he is truly angry with Henry. This is one of the most interesting and intense scenes in the film. It is a very original way of introducing Tommy and Pesci is brilliant. His sudden transitions of behavior make for a truly amazing performance. There is always a sense of menace about him, like he is about to snap any second. Throughout the film he goes to even further lengths to prove himself, like when a bartender stands up to his insults and he murders him or when a mob boss makes fun of him for his previous job as a shoeshiner and he beats him to death.    Violence like this comes naturally in the film. The interesting angle of this is that is not a straight forward morality tale, but about the appeal of the criminal life and the lengths people are willing to go, the emotions they suppress, and the repressed memories they will experience to gain power and wealth.     Now, back to Henry. When Henry feels comfortable with his place in his criminal career, he settles down and gets married to Karen (Lorraine Bracco), a Jewish girl from Brooklyn. She knows that Henry has secrets, but even she is seduced by the rewards involved in living the criminal life. She gladly takes sweaty wads of cash from him to go shopping even though she knows the money is dirty.     The relationship between Henry and Karen is one of the most interesting aspects of the film. Part of the film is a cautionary tale about the affect of living two lives. Henry has to trust Karen and Karen has to trust him. This is the only thing that keeps their relationship together, not to mention their enormous wealth.    One of the most brilliant scenes in the movie is one which consists of a day in the life of Henry Hill as he tries to do a cocaine deal, cook dinner for his family, pick up his brother from the hospital, all while he is being followed by a helicopter. This scene like many others shows what the film is really about: risk versus reward and the consequences of the life you choose.    Having said that, what holds the story together is the tragedy of Henry Hill. He is a genuinely good guy  who cares for others around him, but his double life is an addction. Even though, in the mob life, he experiences acts of violence and tries to repress them, thus causing more deaths, he can't give it up.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|After I first saw this movie, I was like, what in the world did I just watch? So I watched it again and I thought it was probably ine of the funniest things I have ever seen. It was just beyond weird...beyond quirky...it just took me to the edge and dropped kicked my butt into a pile of absolute craziness.<br /><br />If you have never seen this movie, don't go into it with major expectations. Go into it thinking that you're probably going to have to watch it at least twice and for some of you, a third time might be neccessary. I've seen it about 15 times already, but that's because I love this movie. It's just a nice departure from all those other movies that call themselves comedies, but are so formulaic and so contrived, that I hardly even crack a smile.<br /><br />I heard they were going to make a sequel to Napoleon Dynamite. I really hope they don't. If they do make a sequel, they're idiots, gosh!<br /><br />So do yourself a favor and rent, steal, or buy this movie and watch it. You might be scratching your head the first time you see it, but I promise you, that if you let it, it'll grow on you.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I purchased Firefly over a year ago.  The box is frayed on the edges with tape holding one side.  I have a list in my desk of all the co workers who \\"borrowed it\\".  So far, it totals over 15 people.<br /><br />If you like the original Star Trek because of the action, this maybe a series for you.<br /><br />If you were always curious what would happen if someone ran a brothel out of a starship, this may be a series for you.
0920668372|3.0|We received this book Christmas of 2004--two weeks after my son was born. It was given to us by my mother-in-law. I had read it before but didn't quite remember it. I cry every time I read this book. I, unlike others, don't find it creepy or \\"disturbing\\", but just VERY sad. I think we all have to remember the this was written for a child and that the whole thing with the mother climbing into the son's window is taken into a different light by a child. That said, I feel the author really wrote this more for adults with kids and not for the kids themselves...had to, unless she is crazy.  <br /> <br />The basic storyline is about the trials a mother goes through with her son throughout the years from his infancy to adulthood. The ending is very sad and I honestly never get more than a few pages into the book without crying and running to grap up my son and tell him over and over again how much I love him. I would definitely not recommend for sensitive people or people with new babies. Actually, I wouldn't recommend this book at all unless you need a reminder of how short life is...and I think we are reminded of that every day when we wake up in the morning and discover our babies have yet again learned something new or taken those first steps.  <br /> <br />
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Serenity is one of those movies that will be talked about for years to come.  With a deep plot line that always creates more questions than answers as you watch the movie, you will watch this movie until the DVD wears out.  Luckily on June 23, I can purchase another copy from Amazon!<br /><br />Please consider purchasing the TV series on DVD as well.
B00006LLNU|5.0|This album is absolutely breathtaking. <br /> <br />Personally, I think that this is Sigur Rós's best work.  One can't help being completely drawn in and captivated by the incredible soundscapes painted.  All the beauty, joy, and sorrow of life is expressed in a way I didn't think was artistically possible. <br /> <br />The only way to truly understand how amazing this album is is to experience it for yourself.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|Supernatural is a fantastic show with a magnificent plot full of excitement, angst, humor, horror and drama. I guarantee you will rewatch the episodes numerous of times, and it'll capture your full attention.      Apart from the superb storyline, Supernatural features two of the hottest guys on television: Jensen Ackles and Jared Padelacki. The DVD set is worth every cent you spend, and you'll be extremely pleased with the content.
B00006AW2G|5.0|A reviewer of the Rolling Stones album, \\"Let It Bleed\\", by the name of Danielle Lane of North Carolina (dated, June 10 of 2006) stated, \\"Sadly, Mick (Taylor) only stayed with the band for one more studio record, leaving to seek his own career...\\"  That statement is untrue.  Mick Taylor played lead guitar with the Rolling Stones on the following four (4) studio albums that were released after \\"Let It Bleed\\": (1) \\"Sticky Fingers\\", (2) \\"Exile on Main Street\\", (3) \\"Goat's Head Soap\\", and (4) \\"It's Only Rock 'n Roll.\\"
B00092ZMDY|5.0|On Saturday, June 10, 2006 I went to one of the best concerts I've ever been to in Dublin, Republic of Ireland.  That concert was The Eagles - Farewell Tour 1.  Although I have not seen this DVD yet, I can only rate it a 5 star just by the performance given this past Saturday at the Lansdown Road Stadium in Dublin.  The concert was brilliant.  I'm lost for words to describe it.  I got tickets for this concert as a Christmas gift in 2005.  It was worth the money and it was definately worth the wait.  This was one of, if not the best Christmas gift I ever received.  I am going to buy this DVD.  I have no choice but to since I saw this concert.  I was totally blown away!!!!
B00005JOFQ|5.0|Brokeback Mountain is a love story that cuts across lines of gender and sexuality, gripping the viewer with a dreadful sorrow that the deep and passionate devotion that these two lovers feel for each other is forbidden to them, on sentence of death. I cannot imagine how anyone but the most hard-hearted and bigoted of viewers could fail to see that the lovers portrayed in Brokeback Mountain are not different from us--whether we be gay or straight, male or female, rural or urban, we are all capable of loving the same way. Their tragedy is simply that society was and is incapable of accepting them. But most of all, above and beyond its controversial topic, Brokeback Mountain is one of the finest examples of filmmaking I've ever seen. I have bought the DVD, and have cotinually promote it to the people around me since it's so good.
0679446230|1.0|This book had a good cultural outline, but was extremely boring.  The story didn't really pick up until the end, but I wanted to put the book down way before then. It was well written, but too dull for my liking.
B000EULJLU|5.0|I always admired Tool for their vision and style, but until now, I never really appreciated them.  Their technical perfection and creative style has never been as apparent to me as now.  Some of the criticisms seem to be centered on the idea that the songs are long (wtf?) or aren't catchy jingles -- what is wrong with these critics?  The title track is one of the most stellar works of music I've ever heard -- an affirmation of self-realization and a heartbreaking homage to his mother in her 27 year (10,000 day) paralysis and her eventual death. It captures imagery from mythology, religion, psychology and modern poetry to evoke the image of someone claiming their place in the universe.<br /><br />I have to wonder if some of these folks are even listening to the right album.  Your preference is your preference, but the repeated cries of \\"not like the old Tool\\" are pathetisad, and \\"too long\\" and \\"who has the time\\" as mental laziness.  This album has blown away everything else released this year, and not just because it's Tool, but because it's beautiful.<br />I don't like everything they produce, and was pretty much disinterested in Lateralus...so you sheep who are blindly crying sheep based off what someone else likes should drown yourselves.
B00003CX8Y|5.0|It's become a bit of a cliche term when referring to Disney films, but I truly and honestly believe that this film is a timeless, spellbinding and magical classic. \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" was just one film in a string of masterpieces that Disney produced in 6 or so years. \\"The Little Mermaid,\\" started, followed by this film, then \\"Aladdin,\\" and the \\"The Lion King.\\" It's much like what Pixar is experiencing now with THEIR beautiful films, from Toy Story to their latest Cars. However, as much as I love Pixar's films (and believe me when I say I'm a BIG fan of them) they simply don't have the sheer electricity that Disney animation have... or USED to have. It makes me slightly sad, now that computer animation has become the primary way of animation, that the next generation will never be able to FULLY grasp the delight of these particular Disney films, and let's not forget \\"Snow White,\\" \\"Cinderella,\\" \\"Peter Pan,\\"... need I go on? My point is, Disney had such a great thing going with these masterpieces... then they just stopped. And THAT is why it's slightly sad.    Despite this, it IS so wonderful to know that these Disney films ARE still so joyfully remembered. \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" is certainly no exception. With everything from beautiful, colourful animation, a delightful set of characters and simply amazing music and songs, this film replenishes our imagination with the wonders and hopes of any great love story.    Belle is an intelligent young woman living in her modest French town when a twist of fate draws her to an enchanted and somewhat haunted castle in the woods. What she discovers is an array of talking objects, from candlesticks to feather dusters of whom are servents to the master of the castle - a great beast. As sour first impressions fade, Belle and the beast form a close bond. Unbeknown to Belle, the beast is in fact a prince, burdened by a spell that requires the kiss of love to break it. The story is about looking past outer appearences and loving the person underneath the skin.    Despite the universal and important theme, true to Disney form, this film is not preachy, but subtly conveys these ideas through the beautiful characters and music combined. The music, as I mentioned before is simply outstanding. A deeply moving and powerful score, teamed with charming songs gives this film its timeless aura, which still hasn't faded fifteen years on.    You can obviously tell by now that I am a Disney fan through and through. These films, particularly this one, have been a part of my childhood, my education, and my shaping as a person. Words really cannot describe the joy these films give me time and time again, and I can quite garantee that many people, young and old feel the same way. These aren't just films, their building blocks that build the soul.

1592401791|3.0|Here, There and Everywhere is a fascinating read for those of us who are insatiable about the details of the Beatles recording sessions - following the ideas and  <br /> <br />paths that lead to the music we know so well being created. For the most part I was glued to the pages as it's written from a unique perspective, from an individual  <br /> <br />who actually contributed to the music and who'se sonic stamp is indelibly fixed upon it for ever. <br /> <br />Certain procedures to achieve ideas I already knew about as I'm sure many of us did, but there was such insight into others that I read with thirsty glee. The  <br /> <br />anecdotes about the Day in the Life and Strawberry Fields sessions were particularly captivating for me as was the consistent search for the gateway to more bass  <br /> <br />on vinyl. <br /> <br />What disappointed me was Mr Emerick's tedious prostation before Paul at the expense of everyone else including George Martin. I love Paul's work but Geoff's  <br /> <br />dismisal of everyone else and elevating McCartney to the sole saviour and focal point of the Beatles through out their recording idea eventually annoys more than it  <br /> <br />enlightens. I'm always prepared to learn something new and this goes for Beatles history too, but Geoff writes it in such a way that only Paul stands tall with a  <br /> <br />beacon in his upraised hand like the Statue of Liberty, leading the way for all the lesser mortals who somehow manage to stumble their way behind his vision and  <br /> <br />commitment. <br /> <br />The other annoying element is that Geoff Emerick is such a shameless self-aggrandizer, often he writes as if he was the hero of the moment. Maybe he was, but the  <br /> <br />impression I got from the read was that often the main elements in the music recorded by the Beatles were Paul and his buddy Geoff. It was painful to persistantly  <br /> <br />read how George Harrison was a miserable inept human being; Ringo, pointless; John,a flake and a technical Neanderthal; and George Martin a conniving power  <br /> <br />thirsty, focus grabbing self aggrandizer himself! <br /> <br />It is surely Mr Emerick's right as the co author to write the book as he chooses, but it does cause discomfort to read at times, especially knowing that his verbatim  <br /> <br />quotes from 40 odd years ago cannot in any sense be considered accurate. It adds fiction to the mix, I felt this as I was reading it which cheapened the historical  <br /> <br />elements. <br /> <br />I mostly enjoyed the book for what I learnt about the music, the way it was recorded, the techniques, but came away feeling uneasy about Geoff Emerick the person.  <br /> <br />I guess in a similar way he found fault with the Beatles (to a much lesser extent, Paul) I find fault with him.
B000009QPG|5.0|Well...Melissa. It seems you all of a sudden want to be regarded and respected as a serious reviewer. Well, some people actually write good reviews that are very helpful and provide information on the relevant topic, unlike you who just go on a popular metal album and insult the metal brethren. You support horrid music like Green Day and Coldplay and the Black Eyed Peas when all three of those bands are terrible, no talent, and whiny emo bands. Then you insult Megadeth and Slayer!?! If I knew where you live, I would slap you very hard, and not in the good way that you like you dirty goat (...). If you act like a (...) on an internet review site, I can just imagine how sex hungry you must be in the real world. Go back to your preppy suburban neighborhood with the (...) mallcore kiddies cutting themselves to Slipknot and where they play the garbage you like on MTV and the radio while the smart, educated people listen to real music. And, I may have long hair and be ugly, but I am not a psychotic mass murderer like you feel everyone who listens to metal is. And one last thing...It is spelled Deicide, not Decide, you (...) idiot. <br /> <br />Anyway, I am done wasting my time with that nonsense and I will get to the review. Released in 1990, Slayer's epic \\"Seasons In The Abyss\\" is kind of different from anything they have released up to that point in time. Featuring the classic lineup of Tom Araya on bass and vocals, Kerry King and Jeff Hanneman on guitars and drumming monster Dave Lombardo, Slayer produced probably their most polished effort of their career. This would also mark the last album Dave Lombardo would do with Slayer, in which he left and has now returned in 2006 and recorded \\"Christ Illusion\\", set to be released in August. But, anyway, Slayer's past two efforts before this album, 1986's \\"Reign In Blood\\" and 1988's \\"South Of Heaven\\", were more experimental albums (great ones to say the least), and Slayer kind of melded these two together to get 1990's \\"Seasons In The Abyss\\". There was a split between fast and slow stuff, but I prefer the slow stuff on this album. Yes, every song is a 100/10 in my book, but the slower songs just make this more unique. Another cool thing about this album is that the lyrics have gone from goofy Satanic stuff to serious topics like war, society and just evil in general. <br /> <br />The guitar solos in this album have gone from the traditional Slayer Noise Solo's(tm) to more mature, professionally sounding. Maybe because Hanneman is doing some, or they are just trying harder, or whatever, but they do sound ten times better then their previous four albums. I always thought Jeff was a better guitarist then King, but Kerry has the attitude and the look of Slayer. The bass is actually audible, and Araya keeps a good foundation and is perfect with his bass lines, which mostly always mimic the guitars. Araya's vocals are top notch, and this was the prime of his singing career (if you call his monotonous voice singing). The vocals aren't as good as \\"South Of Heaven\\", but they are definitely better then 2001's \\"God Hates Us All\\". And who could forget about Dave Lombardo. This is an awesome drumming performance, once again. He is going at his own pace and the drumming sounds amazing. The thumping double pedals are fast and crazy as always. Put these together, and you get something that is just so amazing that it is an unhealthy addiction. <br /> <br />The first song is \\"War Ensemble\\". This song was one of Slayer's first mainstream songs, and got some MTV and radio play. Usually that would take away from a song (or a band), but this is one of the best songs on the album. And for once, I can actually compliment Slayer for a great guitar solo and great lyrics in this song. The next track, \\"Blood Red\\", is another slow song, but equally as good as the latter song. Both these songs have terrific lyrics. I could never get into the next track, \\"Spirit In Black\\", (hey...that rhymes). For some reason, I usually just skip it, but it is still an amazing song, and better than anyone else can do. The next two songs, though, define what I perceive as quality Slayer. \\"Expendable Youth\\" is another slow to mid-tempo song with an extremely catchy chorus and a couple of good guitar solos. Araya's bass is audible, and sounds terrific. Then, perhaps Slayer's most well known song, \\"Dead Skin Mask\\". This song was inspired by the murderer Ed Gein, and even though it is slow, it is a live favorite and one of Slayer's best songs. It is actually a very creepy song; something this band is great at doing to you.  <br /> <br />The second half of the album is almost as hard hitting as the first. Track 6, \\"Hallowed Point\\" and the seventh song, \\"Skeletons Of Society\\", obviously talk about society and other topics about all things evil. The songs have amazing riffage and excellent solos. \\"Hallowed Point\\" is faster, and the chorus is catchy as ever. \\"Skeletons Of Society\\" has great lyrics and a cool riff. \\"Temptation\\" is another good song, but it then leads up to the two final songs, which are more Slayer masterpieces. \\"Born Of Fire\\" is the second best song on the whole album, and everything about it is great. Slayer always has good ninth songs, which usually sets up for the epic tenth track. This song kind of reminds me of \\"Postmortem\\" from Reign In Blood. After this amazing song is the six minute epic, which is the title track. This song also got mainstream play, and was really what got a lot of people into the band. Slow paced, yet the chorus, the \\"close your eyes...\\" part, is very, very catchy. The whole song is addicting and gets stuck in your head almost to the point of suicide. That epic song caps off another Slayer masterpiece that is still revered as their best work. <br /> <br />Is this the best Slayer album? Well, that question is almost impossible, because everything they have released is superb (even their 90's stuff). Since \\"Reign In Blood\\" is the ultimate speed-metal album, and \\"Hell Awaits\\" is also great, I have to say that \\"Seasons In The Abyss\\" is their third best album, behind those other two. \\"South Of Heaven\\" was an experimental album, but it is still the fourth best. If anyone ever tells you not to get into Slayer, then you should slay them. If you call yourself a metalhead, then these discs are essential to fill your collection. People like the idiot one-star reviewers either like Coldplay or they like to bash controversial bands. Slayer is the perfect example of longetivity and they are still releasing good material nowadays, unlike their counterparts from the 80's like Selloutica or Megadeth. This may not be Slayer's most thrashy CD, but it is great nonetheless and is just great music.
B00005JNRY|5.0|\\"Cars\\" IMHO is the best Pixar movie yet.  It has much more for us Baby Boomers than the other films.  It has humor for all ages, especially the adults.  Young kids 3-6 probably won't like it but older kids and adults will.<br /><br />It is the best \\"G\\" rated family movie I have seen in years.  Go see it and stay through ALL of the credits!!
B00004Y2QT|5.0|This is a great concert DVD for many reasons. Prince is a one of a kind artist. He is beyond doubt a talented instrumentalist and an amazing performer. I have to add, with age he has enhanced his talents and this DVD shows it well. The performance with Lenny Kravitz is incredible, matter of fact that alone is worth the DVD.  Really an entertaining DVD you won't be sorry to add this one to your collection.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|I already own this DVD.  I bought it about two years ago after watching my sisters VCR tape of it. I bought it at Amazon.com .  I paid $69.00 for mine but it was worth every penny.  I am buying two more for me when they are released because I treasure it.  I am also buying a few more to have on hand to give as gifts.  This is a must have for Pink Floyd Fans!~pam j
1400032717|5.0|When I first picked up this, book, it was based a recommendation from a friend. I didn't really know what to expect, but once I started reading it, my hands were glued to the book! I seriously was up all night reading.  <br /> <br />Mark Haddon does a terrific job of creating his character. All the word choices, the first-person narration, and the sentence structure make you understand what the character feels. When I finished the book (maybe it was the first-person narration), I thought that an autistic person had actually written it. (at least, before I read the \\"about the author\\"). Haddon terrifically shows how christopher thinks and feels (albeit in his own way0 <br /> <br />To any of you out there who have not read it, READ IT! You are really missing out.
B000BAQ8A0|3.0|Juan Diego Florez as Count Almaviva is the main reason for my purchase of yet another \\"Il Barbiere Di Siviglia\\" by Rossini.  Although he seemed to be slightly detached from his surroundings in this production, (I guess he's an Opera Super Star!) he does indeed deliver the vocal \\"goods\\".   In possession of a very light flexible and sweet tenor, he very adequately meets all of the vocal challenges of his role.   In addition, he is easy on the eye with a gleaming smile.   <br /> <br />Figaro is sung by small voiced baritone Pietro Spagnoli.  He is a very young and a very nimble Figaro--no standing and delivering but exhibiting much energy by bouncing and hoping around the stage a lot--it was fun to watch! <br /> <br />My only real \\"vocal disappoint\\" was the Rossina as sung by the extremely tiny voiced Maria Bayo; however, she was sadly without high notes.  To me, if a high voiced (as opposed to a mezzo) is used in the role of Rossina that voice should possess loads of high notes otherwise give me a good flexible Mezzo Soprano as the role was originally written for.  Otherwise, it's sleep inducing. <br /> <br />  Bruno Pratico makes a rotund but lively Bartolo.  Again his voice is on the light side but well able to negotiate the ornamentations.   Ruggiero Raimondi is large voiced and very funny making for a very weird Basilio; however he was very amusing indeed. <br /> <br />The production was very busy with all of the characters moving around the stage a lot--very feisty!  The basic colors that are used are black and white which were wonderful.  <br /> <br />The sound and picture quality of the DVD is superb. <br /> <br />Buy this disc manly to see one of today's brightest operatic stars do his thing-- Juan Diego Florez as Count Almaviva.   <br />
B0002DB0FO|5.0|I described Everwood to a friend who hadn't watched the show.  He immediately got the impression that Everwood was a Disney like soap that never really deals with anything in any depth.  I then described various plots in Everwood and I was surprized by the depth of the many plots.  Everwood had conflict; but no matter how deep the conflict the characters maintained a relationship with each other.  There was always something deeper that bonded the characters.  Something that, in my opinion, is terribly missing in current times.  For me, the relationships between the characters in Everwood represented the best in human relationships.  I will miss the show and while it would be easy to blame WB for pulling it, I think the failure of Everwood to find a widespread audience says more about the people in our society than it does WB.
0385486804|5.0|On June 1, 2005 my wife and I went into the Sierra Nevada after having sold, stored, or given away all we owned, that we were not using in the mountains. I saw \\"Into The Wild\\" at about that time, considered it, and passed--I had, in part, judged a book by its cover and that is something I rarely if ever do. I saw self destruction in the cover blurb, suicide possibly, and that was not what we were doing. I couldn't relate it seemed and so I passed. We did over 100 days in the Sierra Nevada and then went into the Sonoran Desert of Arizona, near Tucson. Our journey continued there. Inside of this, and what's coming next, I bought \\"Into the Wild\\" yesterday and began reading it at 5:00 p.m. I couldn't put it down until I finished it at 1:00 a.m. Ever buy a book that you read in one sitting? Here's one and there aren't many out there.  <br /> <br />In the intelligence world I am told they use a term--\\"walking back the cat\\"--and this is truly what Jon Krakauer has done with this superbly conceived and well written story about the life and death of Chris McCandless. His responses to ongoing anger against Chris, interestingly and often conspicuously by Alaskans, are telling--he suggests he has failed because they, as of yet, do not understand. (Jon--these never will and that, too, is not your fault!) <br /> <br />Upon reading it and doing cursory internet research, moreover, I discover how many have traveled to the Stampede Trail site and Fairbanks bus #142. Some from as far away as New York--in pilgrimages of sorts. These people are looking for what Chris was looking for and were hoping to find it there--vicariously--seemingly without having to pay the ultimate price for it as Chris McCandless accidently did. Yet none of them went to (among other places) the canals in Mexico, where Chris wound up on his trip down the Colorado, equally at a dead end and his goal--that which he sought--still outside of his grasp. These people seek \\"understanding\\" but to 'stand under' this epic tragedy and gain by it requires the seeker to look ever so carefully at primarily him/herself. One can travel there, pass by the river and the beaver ponds, sit in the bus, thumb through the suitcase Chris' family left on their visit to that place, and contemplate his life. Yet it is largely meaningless loss unless and until one contemplates his or her own life, there, anywhere, in a variety of possible nowhere's, that--as Chris discovered--beauty in life is meaningless unless it is shared. Once he found it he tried to share it and he (quite possibly) believed he may have have failed at sharing it. He went to great lengths to convey light in the presence of great darkness and this was, I am convinced, more than his being increasingly thought-full towards those he loved--although it was certainly that. In the end Chris has shared what he himself never fully understood and did not know how to share--not exactly but only vaguely.  <br /> <br />People will wrestle with Chris McCandless for quite some time and a renewed interest will surface, no doubt, following release of the movie. I am hopeful Director Sean Penn can capture some of what Chris sought and that which eluded him and that which he found but that which eluded him still--even to the end. In our own 100 days in the wilds we have come to understand a great deal about those things and they are, truly, priceless.  <br /> <br />Jon Krakauer wrote a compelling story about this epic tragedy and he doesn't jump at the convenient to fill space--he walks back the cat and cats don't readily agree to walk back on a leash with just anyone. He found it among Moose remains, a seat on a cable over a river, in the details of a field book and the chemistry of specific alkaloids and nature's efforts to protect the seeds of new growth--the very \\"stuff\\" that Chris McCandless fed upon in more ways than he himself probably understood, except, perhaps, towards the end. He found it in the eyes and in the heart of an old man near the Salton Sea. He found it in a grain elevator in the Dakotas. One has to seek and knock to find and have it opened to him. This is not something just anyone can do and is willing to do. <br /> <br />I still have my reservations of the \\"Thin Air\\" disputes--disputes that seemingly find amplification in the 2006 Everest \\"season\\"--but respect Jon Krakauer's efforts to deal with the points raised in \\"The Climb\\" and remain true to what he believes. I have never doubted his sincerity as an explorer and as a writer. I know something about what that looks like and how to spot it when authentic and Jon is authentic. So I went ahead and bought \\"Into the Wild\\" and read it like it happened yesterday.  <br /> <br />Jon Krakauer wrote a very good book, among his other good books, and it is called \\"Into the Wild.\\" It is a deeply moving story and it is, all of it, intimately true. It leaves unresolved all issues pertaining to faith and for all those whose faith was (or remains) shattered, the hope that builds into new faith can (if you look carefully so as to understand with your heart) be found in the very bag of seeds for new growth one can see plainly enough in this book, and in the hands of Chris McCandless, as something more than seasonal poison to an innocent soul. Isaiah the great prophet asked God, \\"are you a deceiving brook,\\" and it remains the dread of humanity that we think ourselves even remotely capable of knowing good from evil on our own. Go back to Genesis and start over if this is still you for you skipped Lesson 1, on knowing the difference between good and evil, way too fast and are thereby in far and away more danger than Chris McCandless.  <br /> <br />All that Chris found out there on the Stampede Trail, in and about Fiarbanks bus #142, in 1992, remains to be found by each of us. Because he died, unnecessarily looking backwards, does not mean he didn't truly find it (ask Elijah) and because we as of yet don't see it plainly doesn't mean it isn't right in frontof us (ask Elisha). Jon Krakauer has written a superbly relevant book for us all and this is because he looked at himself, at among other things the Devil's Thumb climb, and what his own life, in certain respects, means not only to him but to others. Inside this, then, Jon Krakauer follows the trail blazed by Chris McCandless (as far as he could) so that he could blaze his own, as each of us, in turn, must of we are to understand those lives ours meets. It is where all trails end that, looking back, where we are now, and looking ahead, all true meaning is found at or near where all those trails go next together and what in terms of meaning remains along the way and not discarded by all who came.  <br /> <br />BUY THIS BOOK and then find your own way \\"Into the Wilds\\" if you truly want to be able to say, as Chris did, \\"I have lived a happy life and I thank the Lord.\\" For those who are content with their lives, with urban sprawl, money, belongings, status, prestige, physical and economic security, pride, vanity, avarice, lust, and other flaws, this book offers a glimpse of something too terrifying for you to look into--yourself and what that means to you and to any other. You as of yet do not understand, among others, the teaching of truth, one must hate his own life if he is to become a Disciple. You believe still that you are the exception--not Chris McCandless. You are too busy saving yours and, in the end, it is your life that is lost not that of Chris McCandless. It isn't easy to understand Chris McCandless and his epic story is tragic and it is inspiring.  <br /> <br />Jon Krakauer looks deeply into the void and found something--someone--looking back. So did Chris! <br /> <br />Chris McCandless had a stack of books beside him went he slipped away. This one, about that, \\"Into the Wild\\", is a real keeper and is worthy of being near you \\"when you go.\\" BUY AND READ THIS BOOK! <br /> <br />Stellar work, Jon!! Wow! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B00005QGAZ|4.0|he was so good he made me get all thriller inside j/k and i meant to give it 5 stars
B00005B36H|3.0|I bought Lateralus at the midnight sale when it first came out...this is a very good album but its missing something that every other tool album has...Something about the sound is off.M Missing some energy or something I like it for what it is, and if it was any other band it would get 5 stars. But this is Tool, and this album doesnt measure up to their other work.
B000FBGBPC|5.0|It's been about three years since Three Days Grace last \\"graced\\" us with their debut album, an album which went on to spawn several hits such as \\"Just Like You\\" and \\"I Hate Everything About You.\\" Despite it's cliches, it was still a solid album, and a worhty breakthrough. I always figured that on their next album, Three Days Grace would only get better -- and I was right. \\"One-X\\" is their second full-length album, and improves on every aspect. From the musicianship to the songwriting and the production, everything here is much more professional, more thought-out and most importantly, just better.<br /><br />\\"One-X\\" is the kind of album a busy band on the road comes up with on their second effort. You've heard it all before, about the lonely road, the faceless people, the alcohol/drug abuse. These bases are most definitely covered here. The lead-off single \\"Animal I Have Become\\" -- a song about becoming the victim of your vices -- is the shining example. Despite the dark nature of the album and particular songs like \\"Pain\\" and \\"It's All Over,\\" the album has quite a few bright spots, which the first album was especially lacking. \\"Time Of Dying\\" proudly proclaims \\"I will not die, I will survive\\" and likewise, softer tracks like \\"Never Too Late\\" and \\"On My Own\\" reinforce this message. However, my favorite song on the album is the obligatory anthem, \\"Riot.\\" Built off of an old-school sounding metal riff, I could definitely see this song taking off as the next hit.<br /><br />All in all, every song is a hit, really. I will definitely go as far as to say that this is better than the first album. \\"One-X\\" simply doesn't disappoint. For the fans of the debut, there is plenty of material on here that holds up. For those hoping to see some growth, Three Days Grace surely grow. Without a single weak link, \\"One-X\\" is just a perfect second album.
B00000DFRS|4.0|Okay, so by now, Mrs. Brown's personal demons and public struggles are no secret.  And at press time, she was still off her game so to speak though I'm sure loyal fans truly hope she's able to clean herself up and get back on track. <br /> <br />The only thing you need to know about this album is that Whitney sounds like Whitney (before drug use surely led to much weaker and more pitiful subsequent releases). <br /> <br />The \\"Whitney of Old\\" could go toe-to-toe and pretty much outsing any and all of the popular singers of her day: Ma Donna, Teena Marie, Janet Jackson, Anita Baker, Stephanie Mills, Mariah Carey, Toni Braxton, Mary J. Blige, Faith Evans, Brandy, Monica, Aaliyah, Kelly Price, Christina Aguilera, Celine Dion. <br /> <br />If you've heard or already own Whitney's classics like her self-titled debut ('85), Whitney (1987) and the smash-hit soundtracks to The Bodyguard ('92) and the Preacher's Wife (1996), then \\"My Love Is Your Love\\" is an album worth purchasing or at least giving a listen because of Whitney's awesome vocal abilities. <br /> <br />This is indeed another strong album she made before falling off vocally and as an entertainer. <br /> <br />Recommended purchase.
B00000JZIQ|1.0|If you need a reminder of all that was wrong with the American culture in the 1960's, check out this VERY DULL flick. Ludicrous and demeaning fashions (only for the female, of course), sparse and meaningless dialogue, gimmicky cinematography that dates the film as surely as the old Don't-squeeze-the-Charmin  commercials date TV, and shallow-shallow-shallow characters. The over-loud and intrusive music grates on one's nerves. McQueen has the good grace to appear embarrassed in all of his \\"too cool\\" scenes, and Dunaway was likely just grateful for a job at that time. This was someone's confused idea of entertainment that wasn't.
B000F6IOC0|5.0|Now this is what all movies aspire to be.  <br /> <br />Action that is insane, stunts that you have to watch the behind the scenes stuff just to figure out and a bad guy that you not too sure how your supposed to kill. Throw all this together, hammer out a lover story of star crossed lovers and a thousand years of turmoil, and here we are.  <br /> <br />They out did themselves with this one, bigger, badder, better. From the get go they set the pace of the run and the chase. Selene and Michael are still on the run, good thing since it is all of an hour or three after what went down last time. The whole world seems ready to fall in on them, and then there comes Marcus all hell fire and brimstone ready to tear it all asunder and get what he wanted from the get go. Evidentially, a hundred years in a hole and you come out with a few resolutions.  <br /> <br />The special effects in this story were enough to propel the rest of the story line along. Not over done or under stated, and giving Marcus those wicked wings added for an awesome bad guy. <br /> <br />Great flick, excellent way to continue the story.
B00005JOVH|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie. I know some fans say it's a departure from the original comic book X-Men concept. I myself don't know enough to say; all I know is that I enjoyed the story and all the non-stop action and special effects. Dozens of new X-men with different talents are introduced, and part of the fun is just seeing what will happen there next. Relationship-wise, this movie focuses on Wolverine and Jean, who is now the only class 5 mutant known, even more powerful than Magneto. I note one reviewer here who said he wasn't happy with Patrick Stewart getting killed--but he should have stayed through the end of the credits--there's one final brief scene where we learn that isn't final. The climactic scene with the Golden Gate Bridge has to be the best special effects scene of the year. My only criticism, which is small (and the reason I rate it four stars instead of five) is that I think they made too much of Jean's mental instability. I don't see why a super powerful X man (or woman, in this case) would automatically be mentally unstable and need to be psychologically conditioned and controlled as Stewart was doing with Jean so that they wouldn't go crazy and cause harm. But all in all a fun movie and worth seeing on the big screen.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|I have been following the Chili Peppers for quite some time and this is one of their best albums.  Two weekends ago I went to Cape Cod with my best friend and he was playing this album the whole time and it really grew on me.  As soon as I got home I bought it immediately.  Musically this album blows my mind.  The guitar riffs in \\"Ready-Made\\" are insane.  Other songs like, \\"Hard to Concentrate\\" show off their ability to write a love song.  A love song that rocks out and at the same time has a very serious side to it.  \\"Tell Me Baby\\" is a catchy tune that is really good to blast as you are driving around.  Jupiter on the other hand is a completely different experience.  Jupiter starts off with \\"Dani California\\" which we have all heard by now on the radio.  \\"Snow\\" is a fun upbeat song which is a ballad of sorts.  The lyrics aren't particularly deep, but a fun song nevertheless.  I love the slow jazz feel of \\"Slow Cheetah\\" and the upbeat jumpy sound of the horns blasting in \\"Torture Me\\".  All in all a very worthwhile purchase.  Everytime I listen to the album it gets better and better.
B000003TA4|5.0|NIRVANA gets better with every single album they write. Dave Grohls drumming is the best since John Bonhams, Krist's Bass playing is so good, the dude actually plays a separate line than the guitar on most songs, somthing you dont see in todays music, Kurts songwriting style and structure is comparable to john lennons, and though his guitar playin may not be the most advanced in the world it is definately one of the hardest and grungiest and his singing is uncomparable. This is the ideal rock band other people say pearl jam, alice in chains, and soundgarden are better. but none of those bands would have ever gotten anywhere had it not been for Nirvana (not to rip on any of those bands though. Nevermind alone destroyed all of the hair bands guns n roses, van halen, motley crue, def leopard, the scorpions,etc.. ever wonder why those guys stopped making albums that were good? nirvana is the reason. now to the songs on the album: <br />Smells like teen spirit: 10/10 the raise of grunge, it is definately over played today, which sad seein how great of a song it is. <br />In Bloom: 10/10 best song on the album, great guitar solo. the song is slap in the face to people who sing along with songs but dont know what the lyrics mean. <br />Come as you are: 10/10 this what i mean with Krist's bass playing <br />Breed: 10/10 just a hardcore rock song  <br />Lithium: 10/10 also great bass playing,listen to the part at the bridge and the end you can really hear krist take off on the bass/ cobains vocals rock on it as well. <br />polly: 8/10 slower and acoustic keeps the album from all sounding the same. <br />territorial pissing: 8/10 hard/fast song i find it a bit overrated, its still good though. <br />drain you: 10/10 great song, cobain considered this better than teen spirit, extremely underrated. <br />lounge act: 5/10 weekest song on the album, the song \\"aneurysm\\" from incesticide should be here instead. <br />stay away: 10/10 everything rocks on the song krists bass playingin the bridge, dave's drum solo in the end, Cobains vocals. it all rocks. <br />on a plain: 10/10 also an underrated song, very good <br />something in the way: 10/10 softest song on the album, is very good, i only wish therre were more parts to it, the cello playing in it adds an extra feeling to it. <br />** Endless Nameless** is the hidden track on some of the CDs. i am very upset that mine doesnt have it, but ive heard the song. they all go crazy on it. kurts guitar and Krists bass go crazy and unrepeatable at the end cobain starts rippin his guitar appart. <br />
B00000IAU3|2.0|I understand why so many people like Dido..She is beautiful, has a decent voice, comes across as a decent human being and is inoffensive...This album is the same - 'inoffensive'...some might say, bland...The tracks that work for me are 'Thank You' (used on Eminem's 'Stan'), but is done solo here and it works, 'Hunter' and 'Here With Me'...The rest just disappear into the background like a passing car...Nothing much happens, nothing inspires...I really want to like her, but it's all been done before...
B000002ADT|5.0|I've heard good things about this album but I never would expect it to be this good. Once you start listening to this album, you're hooked and it gets better each time you hear it. <br />This album has an all star cast with Miles on trumpet, Cannonball Adderley on alto, the Trane on tenor, and Bill Evans on piano. <br /> <br />So What and Freddie Freeloader are very cool songs with catchy leads and great solos. When you listen to Blue in Green, you will cry because of how beautiful the song is. All Blues is a nice 3-4 piece with a good melody. Flamenco Sketches closes the album out perfectly with a glorious ending. <br /> <br />This album is perfect and the masterpiece of Miles Davis. All jazz fans should own this album along with Coltrane's A Love Supreme, Stepping Stones by Woody Shaw, and Live at the Village Vanguard by Wynton Marsalis.
B000000OSE|1.0|Come on if your dumb enough to think your good enough to release to cds at the same time think again. The only singeles that were good Use your illusion 1 & 2 had were not even there own they were covers. If thats not alarm bells ringing of in their head before they release it i don't know what is. If they put the best songs on 1 cd and released it would still be crap. <br />Thank god everyone else besides axel have had brilliant recording & releases since the break up of guns & roses, because axels a loser & everyone else deserves it for putting up with him. <br />And Axel if you ever read this your lucky Vince Neil didn't knock you out ya loser!!!!!!!!
B00005JOVH|2.0|DISCLAIMER: this review contains spoilers that may ruin your viewing of this film for those of you who are counting on this review to tell you whether or not to see it. If you wish for surprises, do not read this review, if you don't mind knowing what happens or my opinion on it, then please read on.          Jean is back... Mad as a hatter. Humans have developed a \\"Cure\\" for the \\"Mutant problem,\\" and... and...     Well, as far as the plot goes, it isn't all that for such a highly anticipated movie. But not to fret, the title, \\"The last stand\\" refers to a point in the movie where the last of the X-men stand together to prevent the brotherhood from entering a facility, in other words, not only are they in the midst of working on the final X-men movie [X4], but the producers/creators are also thinking up of spin off movies [Wolverine the movie is being considered as of this date]. The X-men series is far from dead. Now that I've put you at ease about the title, and hope for the next movie, let me tell you about this one.    Note: I've never been a fan of sequels, but X2 is one of the best sequels I've ever seen, since it introduced so many new mutants and left such a good storyline open with a few plot twists and blah blah blah. I really liked X2's imagination. X3 however...     While watching the movie, I got the vibe after the first 15 minutes that this movie was made solely to flick off the characters who's actors just didn't want to be on the project [after such a poor run in X1, Cyclopes just never got back in the game... sadly he leaves us, and we never truly see him leave]. Don't get me wrong, watching Jean as a child in the first 5 minutes of the movie was great, but when she came back in a dazed state and scott is... obliterated... It just didn't really get any better than the first scene. [I did wonder why storm didn't go the way of the dodo seeing as how halle berry did put up a small fuss about it in the begining of production of this movie [but she signedon anyway]].     Not only does cyclopse die, but so does patric stewart. Now, being a big fan of his, I was... appalled and more than a little disappointed when he left in the film, and I was more than just a little put out knowing Nightcrawler is NOT in this movie. But enough of what went wrong for me in the movie theatre; allow me to mention other points of the movie.    Finally after much awaited time, Wolverine is not the center of attention [Sadly, no one really is in this film]. True they've strayed quite a bit from the cartoon's version of X-men, but it's still pretty nice. Ice man and pyro go in for a showdown, as does that girl who walks through walls, and Colossisiss... whatever the heck that metal man's name is, team up together as well as some other goodies. However, after the third installment of the movies, Gambit still has not come onto the scene. But in his place we've got a much more blue character who lightens one's face up whenever he comes onto the screen with his beautiful acting and wonderful dialogue... but, just as Yoda's 30 second light saber fight in episode II was the only good reason to see that film, they almost pulled the same thing here, as Beast's 10 second fight is pretty sweet to see. Thankfully, the acting is so much better than the star wars franchise, and there are a few more reasons to watch this film.    With all that said, let me get back to Jean. She is... \\"Reincarnated\\" or something, they didn't really make that clear how she's still alive, however I will note that while watching her story unfold I suddenly smiled as a thought came to me as Xavier is \\"Trying\\" to explain what's going on with her,     \\"They're making this up as they go along...\\"    This was yet another vibe I got while watching the movie. I don't know about the rest of the public but I love plot lines and stories that provoke thought! The first X-men did this and mixed in enough action to leave one's eyes popping out for a sequel. X2 did an even better job and killed two birds with one stone, not only moving character pieces around the board, but also explaining wolverine a little better. X3 is little more than a bridge to X4 which hopefully... will be so the best of them all.    Now I really liked X2 because you got to see alot more of every mutant's power, even if it was for a few seconds. They tried to do the same thing here but, with so much to look at, one finds that most of the so called \\"Powers\\" the mutants have in this movie just aren't as imaginative. In fact other than the main villains [Jugant ect ect], there are none that catch the eye, or are worth mentioning on this review. True, there are more villains with super powers out there, just none of them as good, or shown to be as good.     Allow me to sum all this up.    I give this film 2 stars for it's sheer lack of effort. I give it to the actors for being such good sports and though it does seem at times that they really are making up their own lines as they go, they still acted like their characters. Beast was really nice to look at, and of course Who can't wait to see Wolverine and Jean go at it in the lab room? Come on, be honest now...   But frankly the story just wasn't cutting the mustard on this one, and with the excess of mutants, you never really did see alot of powers adequately. True there are a few good fighting scenes at the end of the movie, but not enough to warrant another star. X2 showed almost all of the powers for a bunch of little kids, why couldn't they do the same thing for a bunch of older meaner bad guys?   I did not like that this movie had a flavour of, \\"Let's get rid of some people today,\\" throughout the movie, as well as if the writers were saying, \\"Let's do this, even though there's no reason, but let's do it anyway.\\" Now, I could handle a few really good deaths that are dramatic, but most of the deaths were just plain ludicrous.     NOTE: the movie ends with a small sliver of hope, but not enough to warrant a sequel. watch themovie through the credits so that you can have a glimmer of hope for what is to come.    I am not bashing the acting, the directing or the special effects [Magneto moving the San Fran bridge is pretty cool to look at]. I'm just saying I expected more from a third installment from what seemed to be an almost better series than the current Spiderman films, however I'm just not so sure anymore with its lack of... Imagination and some key characters. Nightcrawler and Gambit, where'd they go?     While this movie is entertaining the first time you watch it, you'll either love it or hate it. Out of all three X-men movies, X2 is the best so far, because the last stand is a step back.
B0002IQNAG|5.0|\\"Dawn of the Dead\\" is a damn near perfect sequel to \\"night\\" and is undoubtedly one of the richest, satirical, doomy and apocalyptic horror movies ever filmed. No one can do social commentary via horror movie as well as romero, and his sense of the absurd and subtle yet scathing critique of consumerism is amusing and not at all pretentious. The sequence in which the biker gang breaks into the zombie infested mall is probably one of the most memorable scenes I've ever seen in any film, in the horror genre or outside of it. A particularly unsavory member of the group gets his intestines torn out by a zombie while getting his blood pressure checked, and it looks utterly real and not at all fake or cheesy. When one of the group is bitten on a 'truck raid' and turns into a zombie underneath a blanket in their hideout, he slowly pulls it from his face and the effect is really stomach churning and frightening. this is not just for horror fanatics, but anyone who loves an entertaining yet substantive film. Needless to say if you ARE a horror fan, you can't be worthy of the name till you see this utterly flawless and well executed masterpiece.
0340827246|5.0|I thought this would be kind of silly, but the recipes are just like mama would make.  They work and they are tasty.  It's a great way to celebrate family night in front of the Sopranos with a bowl of pasta!
B0002S947K|4.0|I never write reviews because reviews usually aren't any help when I set out to purchase something but.......<br /><br />This album made me smile from the very first song. Not because there was anything to smile about in particular, but the lyrics, the rhythm, the voice all came together wonderfully for me. I haven't listened to anything else in the past week since I purchased this album.<br /><br />Is he the next genius of our lifetime?? Certainly not (artists of that caliber no longer exist). Is he worth the P14.99?? I say yes.<br /><br />If you consider yourself the music connoisseur and need deep insightful lyrics, if you constantly harp on about influences, rhythms etc then you'll probably have a complaint or two.<br /><br />On the other hand if you like music simply because it is and you can.....to not absolutely embrace this album (at least for a while) will be very difficult.<br /><br />Track 6; Forever Your Friend is particularly nice. I hope you enjoy it as much as I do if you do go ahead and purchase it  :-)
B0009X766Y|5.0|i first saw this movie after seeing Ocean's Eleven starring George Clooney, and I thought nothing could be better than that. However, when my parents sat me down to watch the Sting, i fuond out every movie that has anything to do with cons came out of that one.  <br /> <br />The Sting, starring the dynamic duo Paul Newman and Robert Redford, is about revenge for the death of a collegue. Newman is the one who knows all the tricks, and Redford is the one trying to learn them. The whole movie is full of twists and turns that make it so much more enjoyable than any other con movie. Winner of several Academy Awards, I recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys good tricks that makes stealing look like it's fun.
0698119347|5.0|Absolutely easy to read through, and a very interesting page-turner, StormBreaker, is one of the more memorable, Action-packed, and interesting books I have read. <br /> <br />Alex Rider, the main character of the book, is 14 years old, and is recruited for MI6 British Intelligence work almost immediately after his uncle's death, which was supposed to be a car accident. But the real reason of his death was that he had been a spy for MI6, and was discovered by Herod Sayle. He had Alex's uncle killed, and now MI6 was sending Alex, after a few weeks of military training, to finish the job, and find out Herod Sayle's secret. MI6 has been suspicious of him, because he was giving every student in England a new kind of computer, a StormBreaker. And after one boy had won a trip to Sayle Enterprizes to \\"test-out\\" the new computers, MI6 had their chance. This was a perfect opportunity for MI6, and the perfect cover for Alex, and although it isn't easy to uncover the buried secret of the guards around Sayle Enterprises, the laboratories below, and the diagram Alex's uncle had hid in his room, Alex soon saves all of the schoolchildren of England from a maniac's genocide-type plan, after escaping near death himself. <br /> <br />This adventure will fly by, and you will have read the 192 pages of hard-packed, fast-paced action, and you will long to read the next in the series, Point Blank, including Alex's second adventure. <br />
B000BRBA8S|4.0|2046 is a marvellous about love and the feelings that remain even when love is gone. But within this we have the dealings of what 2046 which is a novel being written. While the focus is of love within that novel, we are set in this hyper-futuristic tale that characters travel to the future to regain lost memories. <br /> <br />It's a story that is fascinating both inside and outside of the novel that is being made. One that shows that people as a whole, don't like change. They have problems with moving on and perhaps in their hearts have always lost the ones they really loved. And as is the way with things, people try to get along with their lives whether they fully realize this or not. In a sense they want to go back to how things were before because they might want to recapture that spark the relationship once had or recapture the youth they once had as they feel themselves getting older and closer to their inevitable demise. <br /> <br />But before I make this sound like it's one of those depressing love stories to rival the likes of Verhoeven's adaptation of Jan Wolkers' Turkish Delight, I should tell them to relax, it's not like that at all. It has it's bittersweet melancholy but the tone is more wistful, than the overbearing suffocation of Turkish Delight. In locating it in Hong Kong of the 1960s, it shows that Hong Kong was still a thing of beauty and still ahead of it's time. In many respects, it's architecture is something some of the developed countries still aspire to and have been playing catch up ever since. <br /> <br />But it's the scenes of the future, or the future imagined for the novel that's been written which really captivates the eye. The colours, the textures make this film glorious viewing for the viewer. I can't even begin to describe, how intricate and how colourful it really looks.....I'd almost say it takes on a life of it's own. To call it spectacular is to do it an injustice - it's so much more than that! <br /> <br />All the actor's play their part extremely well in this gorgeous movie. Really, there can't be too much more said about such a beautiful movie. Watch and enjoy!
B00007LTIL|5.0|I've had this recording for 20 years or so, long before I listened to any recordings of Dead shows, & just put it on this morning after burning out halfway through Dick's Picks vol. 7.  It's a gem.  Contrary to those who say you need to listen to the Dead live first, I think this album has a tighter, richer, more instrumentally polished feel than a lot of their live stuff.  Reckoning (another gem, acoustic sets) comes close.  There's also something to knowing the studio versions so you can hear how much the songs change live (compare Sugar Magnolia here to the Feb 24, 1971 version for example).  Garcia's voice is crisp and clear here, without the fatigue that comes through in a lot of live recordings.  How many other items get practically unanimous 5 star ratings?
B000F4PD7G|4.0|I recently saw this film at a special showing in Las Vegas and <br />was very impressed with the beauty of production.  It is a very <br />unusual story and definitely not the usual 'hollywood' fare.  The <br />story was real study in what is good and evil, and our perceptions <br />of heroes and villians.  Not everything is always black and white.  The scenery is unbelievably beautiful and other worldly.  The <br />acting is good, especially Gerard Butler and Stellan Skaarsgard. <br />I understand it is going to be released later this month in limited <br />engagements in five or six major U.S. cities.  There will also be  <br />a DVD released in July from Canada.
B00003CXCT|4.0|Like a myriad of other reviewers I'm also a film purist, I like to see a film in its original theatrical form and format. Making changes (adding or cutting) is akin to blasphemy as far as I'm concerned. Furthermore, being of an age that allowed me to see 'Star Wars', 'The Empire Strikes Back' and 'Return of the Jedi' during their original theatrical release ('77-'83). I cringe at the thought of watching what Lucas has done.<br /><br />However with that said I have to admit the 'Star Wars' trilogy as it is still demands enough loyality and interest to persuade many to acccept them as offered. I'll await the release of the original versions scheduled for DVD release later this year.
B000F0UV0E|5.0|<br />Enough said.  Loved it!  My two favorites are Beachcombing and This is Us.
B000006NUW|5.0|Some have complained about the mono mix but for me this makes the set an even more fantastic trip down memory lane.  Sounds like you're hearing it for the first time on a junky portable radio and that's the way I remember most of these songs.<br /><br />If you have to have the stereo mixes then you can get them in other box sets or on other single cd releases.  Personally, I'd stay away from that sound.  It just couldn't be the same.<br /><br />One warning for new listeners.  These songs were meant to be played on 45 record players, am radios in cars or on jukeboxes.  The mono sound mentioned above works its real magic in these settings.  You can recreate a lot of the sound by playing these cds in your car but it just doesn't work on an ipod.<br /><br />None the less this is what made music special when I was a kid and I wouldn't trade the sound for stereo for a million bucks.
B000002L9J|5.0|I've loved the Smiths for a long time now...I remember I borrowed some tape or another at the library and copied some of my favourite songs.  I don't remember which one it was cos it doesn't seem to jive with what's readily available.  Enough of my babbling.  So recently due to the influence of an evil friend, I started purchasing the Smiths.  This one has my absolute favourite \\"There Is a Light That Never Goes Out\\"; I'm a touch morbid, but you've got to be.  Plus it has fun songs as well.  We all must remember that \\"Some Girls are Bigger Than Others\\"....  Enjoy...whether you're new or revisiting the \\"good\\" old days...or is that daze???
B000002I25|4.0|To be honest, I never intended to buy this, or any other, Doors CD. I thought I would be best off with just my one-disc best of. But when I saw their debut at my local record store for ten bucks, I couldn't pass it up.<br />1. Break On Through (to the Other Side): 10/10. Classic Doors rocker with some very vivid imagery about the unknown. Starts things off in the right direction.<br />2. Soul Kitchen: 8/10. A kinda spooky song about sex (a dominant theme on this album). I like it, very underrated.<br />3. The Crystal Ship: 8/10. A haunting ode to drugs that finds its way on many compilations. Again, it's good.<br />4. Twentieth Century Fox: 10/10. Anybody besides me love the title? Anyway, it's a clever rocker about a hot woman and another one of the Doors' most underrated.<br />5. Alabama Song (Whiskey Bar): 5.5/10. One of the few songs that doesn't really work. Turns out that a show tune doesn't sound too good reworked by a rock band.<br />6. Light My Fire: 10/10. Contreversy central. It got them banned from the Ed Sullivan Show due to its sexually explicit lyrics and the line \\"Girl, we couldn't get much higher\\" (thought to be about drugs). Its length (7:08) was also contreversial. Shows that guitarist Robbie Krieger and organist Ray Manzarek could actually be talented instrumentalists if they tried. Oh, and I love the line \\"And our love become a funeral pyre\\".<br />7. Back Door Man: 10/10. You know it's a good cover when it gives the original a run for its money. And Back Door Man does just that, with an added second verse. Jim's menacing vocals are absoluetly perfect for Willie Dixon's dark lyrics. Fits in with the album thematically quite well.<br />8. I Looked At You: 6/10. WHAT? After all the good stuff (With the exception of Alabama song) that happened on the first side, we get THIS? Damn, if this isn't a paint-by-numbers tune I don't know what is. But it isn't bad, either... just not good.<br />9. End of the Night: 8/10. That's more like it. Spooky, haunting and impressive. I wish this song hadn't disappeared from the Doors' catalogue. Oh well.<br />10. Take It As It Comes: 5.5/10. Another lesser cut. And it's an undignified intro to...<br />11. The End: 10/10. (Actually, more like 10[...]/10).<br />You either love or hate the Doors, and this song is used as an argument for either side. Some people think it's just the ramblings of a raving drunk stretched out to twelve minutes and accompanied by low-key music played with all the talent of a garage band. Others (me included) see it as a haunting, dark poem, an exploration into the mind of an extremely tortured man. But that's just me. This and Riders On the Storm are Jim Morrison at his most poetic.<br />Ave: 8.27. A good debut album, but some tracks are pretty bad.<br />One thing I love about the Doors is how they were an alternative to what was going on in '67 musically. This was the year of such flower-power albums as Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, Magical Mystery Tour, Between the Buttons, Are You Experienced... and here we've got Jim, singing about sex, death, the unknown and drugs. In other words, he explains the happy little seamy underbelly of the counterculture (so would that make him counter-counterculture?) So if you want some of the darkest music this side of the Velvet Underground, go after the Doors!hadn't disappeared from the Doors' catalogue. Oh well.  10. Take It As It Comes: 5.5/10. Another lesser cut. And it's an undignified intro to...  11. The End: 10/10. (Actually, more like 10[...]/10).  You either love or hate the Doors, and this song is used as an argument for either side. Some people think it's just the ramblings of a raving drunk stretched out to twelve minutes and accompanied by low-key music played with all the talent of a garage band. Others (me included) see it as a haunting, dark poem, an exploration into the mind of an extremely tortured man. But that's just me. This and Riders On the Storm are Jim Morrison at his most poetic.  Ave: 8.27. A good debut album, but some tracks are pretty bad.  One thing I love about the Doors is how they were an alternative to what was going on in '67 musically. This was the year of such flower-power albums as Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, Magical Mystery Tour, Between the Buttons, Are You Experienced... and here we've got Jim, singing about sex, death, the unknown and drugs. In other words, he explains the happy little seamy underbelly of the counterculture (so would that make him counter-counterculture?) So if you want some of the darkest music this side of the Velvet Underground, go after the Doors!
B000002UAO|5.0|THIS ALBUM IS A CLASSIC. PLEASE DON'T LISTEN TO KIDS REVIEWING, <br />ESPECIALLY KIDS WHO CAN'T SPELL THE GROUPS THEY MEAN TO BASH. <br />IF NOT FOR THE BEATLES, ALL ARTISTS TODAY WOULD BE LOST. <br />EVEN THE HORRIBLE SOUNDS OF HIP-HOP AND TECHNO OWE THESE LADS <br />THANKS FOR WHAT THEY SHOWED COULD BE DONE IN THE STUDIO. <br />TAKE A LESSON \\"KIDS\\". THIS IS ONE TO GROW ON.
B000001FMX|5.0|It doesn't get much better than this.  For a band that only released two studio albums, they sure packed a punch.  This record is nearly perfect from start to finish.  Some songs are a tad bit better than others, but it is a must buy.  I really think there needs to be more bands like the Dolls out now, but alas, there aren't that many.  But play this record loudly, for it sounds much better than any of today's top artists.
B000FBGBPC|5.0|I've never felt more connected or attached to a cd in my life. Their debut album was great, but somehow One-X is even better! These guys are an absolute amazing band. Adamn has got one of the best voices *the best in my opinion* in all of rock music. He sings about every emotion one can go through in life. Each and every song on the album is great and you can't help but listen to this cd day after day after day..hour after hour..and so on. It's THAT good. <br /> <br />1. It's All Over. 10/10 song bout drugs/drinking and how one that goes so far in doing so is basically ready to end their life..they are on the edge and about to fall off and they need to realize what they are doing and turn their life around instead. <br /> <br />2. Pain- 10/10 About being numb to things around you. NO people this song isn't 'sexual' hahaha. It's a VERY good catchy song. It's going to be a GREAT single for them. <br /> <br />3. Animal I have become 10/10 I've loved this song from the very second I heard it. Tons of people can relate to this song. Also very catchy/good lyrics. <br /> <br />4.Never Too Late- 10/10 When I first heard this song I cried. It's such a heartwrenching song. Adam sings about suicide and that when one thinks its too late and that they want to end their life that they can turn it all around because it's never too late. AMEN TO THAT! <br /> <br />5.On My Own- 11/10 hehe. My favorite song on the album!! Adam's voice is so melodic in this song, and the lyrics are great. I love how it goes from slow in the beginning of the song to upbeat rock in the chorus. Great song! <br /> <br />6.Riot- 10/10 THIS IS ONE AWESOME SONG TO ROCK OUT TO! I cannot wait to hear when I see them in July. Hardcore song that just makes you want to get up and rock out. <br /> <br />7.Get Out Alive- 10/10 The lyrics in this song are so amazing. Everything Adam says is 100% true! Just an overall great song. Everyone will love this one. <br /> <br />8.Let It Die- 10/10 I love how absolutely blunt Adam is in this song \\"I just don't care about you anymore\\" LOVE it. Great song that most people will definitely relate to. <br /> <br />9-Over & Over 10/10 Adam sings about one that he cares deeply for and that he can't help but fall for them over and over again. He's so passionate when singing this song. BEAUTIFUL song! Adam's voice is so soothing in this song. <br /> <br />10- Time Of Dying- 11/10 Definitely one of my favorites on this album. This song is pretty straight-forward and raw. I absolutely love it. Who am I kidding..I love em ALL. <br /> <br />11. Gone Forever- 11/10 Great song for anyone who's had someone in their life for so long and finally realizes that they don't need them anymore and that they are better off without them. Adam's voice in this song is AMAZING. Like I said his voice is my favorite out there but in this song is just gives me the chills for some reason!  <br /> <br />12. One-X 10/10 I cried when first hearing the song. Everyone can pretty much relate to it. Especially the first chorus \\"Do you think about everything you've been through, you never thought you'd be so depressed are you wondering is it life or death, do you think that there's no one like you?\\" Very powerful song, and a great anthem. Awesome way to end the Cd. Very uplifting. <br /> <br />Bonus song: Running away 10/10. Yep every song on the album INCLUDING the bonus song is great.  <br /> <br />This Cd is the best I've ever purchased. I HIGHLY recommend this to any rock fans out there. Three Days Grace is becoming huge and it's well deserved. They are such a great band with four major talented rockers. I'm a fan for life.
0385336691|4.0|The new Lee Child is, of course, superb.  The quality of his writing is unerringly even and unerringly high.  He sets the standard for suspense writing.  The savvy behind his craft is apparent in The Hard Way, since the canvas is very narrow and potentially even claustrophobic.  The bulk of the novel is set in Manhattan, with strict geographic constraints.  The latter portion of the novel is set in East Anglia, but again, with constraints.  This could be a textbook case for aspiring crime writers--contrast this book with, e.g., Angels and Demons or The DaVinci Code.  All three novels are suspenseful, but look at the lengths (thematic, geographic, etc.) to which Dan Brown must go to create the suspense.  Lee Child achieves greater suspense within great constraints.  That could be part of the definition of masterful genre writing.<br /><br />Now for the mini-protest.  Lee, we love you, but we need a more violent ending.  A major catharsis requires a major blood-letting.

B0001HAISG|5.0|The mixed reviews for P.J. Hogan's 2003 hit \\"Peter Pan\\" leave you wondering if adults should be permitted to give a bad rating to a children's film. The vast majority of the reviews were positive ones, as the reviewers either liked the film themselves, or were convinced that it would be very entertaining viewing for children. The negative reviews came from adult critics who found little \\"personal\\" enjoyment and never really bothered about the children factor.    I only bring this up because J. M. Barrie's play, while addressing early adolescent angst, was actually intended for adult audiences who presumably would be prompted to retrospectively analyze the angst of their own dim past. Thanks to the toning down of Barrie's basic theme in the Disney and Mary Martin versions, \\"Peter Pan\\" became almost exclusively a children's story. Then along came Hogan's version, which fused the thematic emphasis of the original with the children's entertainment emphasis of the others.     Meaning that the film hits a home run with three very distinct target audiences. Once thing for sure is that this spectacular adaptation has almost universal appeal to preteen children, they will watch it countless times and you can't go wrong buying or renting it for that age group. And perceptive adolescents struggling with their own growing up process should relate to it. And finally, those adults (particularly males) who have consciously resisted the growing up process their entire lives should connect to this film like few others.     But if you don't belong to these three groups you will wonder what all the fuss is about. The answer is that this film uniquely focuses on the maturation process, which most girls embrace about sixth grade and most boys resist until 9th grade (and would resist even longer if girls were not luring them with the most obvious benefit of growing up). Some boys stubbornly hold out like Peter Pan, usually because they do not have a Wendy to pull them forward, and when they finally surrender and move forward into adulthood, they are aware that they are abandoning something precious and will look back with regret on the moment for the rest of their lives.     Now with that issue addressed this is \\"Peter Pan\\" and virtually everyone knows the story. It is a live action version superior to the stage version if only because it is unburdened by the play's odd cross-dressing tradition and the preschool Disney fusion of bad songs and lame slapstick humor. The production design should blow away all viewers, child and adult, with a dreamy Maxfield Parrish Victorian look and Barrie's treasure-map Neverland. The pacing is fast and Hogan shows a respectful grasp of how an imaginative child would visualize things while reading Barrie's story.     \\"Peter Pan\\" is really Wendy's story and there is no fault to find in Rachel Hurd-Wood's performance, which would be good enough to carry the film but fortunately is not required to do so. Wendy is second only to Wonderland's Alice as the bravest literary heroine of all time and Hogan nicely incorporates the many admirable qualities of her character into the story.    Jeremy Sumpter's Peter is far more obnoxious than appealing, but isn't that what you would expect from a boy who refuses to grow old.     Ludivine Sagnier's Tinkerbell provides comic relief to go with her homicidal tendencies; only adults want cute, children want pretend-nasty and this Tink is worthy of Barrie's original characterization. The \\"save Tink\\" audience chant is nicely incorporated into a full-cast montage.    Hook is played with a controlled zest by Jason Isaacs, not quite the self-parody of a Gary Oldham performance but his restraint is exactly what is needed.     Adults and children know that \\"Peter Pan\\" isn't so much suspension of disbelief as it is an exercise in self-knowing whimsy. You know that the mix of fairies, pirates, Indians and ticking crocodiles are devices designed to obscure the difficult facts of growing older.If you can't go with it then you surrendered something a long time ago that Peter is still stubbornly holding onto.    Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.
B00004XQP4|4.0|News Flash!!!  Green Day = Punk band; Led Zepplin = Rock band.  COMPLETELY DIFFERENT GENRES. COMPLETELY DIFFERENT MUSIC made for COMPLETELY DIFFERENT core audience.  But both bands have a particular type of genius, and yes, both bands will be legendary when all is said and done.  I appreciate the musical talent of Led Zepplin, as they are truly masters of their instruments.  But I can also appreciate the true talent of Green Day as well, particularly evident in the lyrics of Billie Joe. Print out a few select Green Day song lyrics (Minority, Warning, even Macy's Day Parade) and it reads like a poem. Like something you have said, or have always wanted to say, to a parent, a cop, a lover, a friend, to God, or even to yourself. They know their audience and understand the thoughts and emotions. That's the whole point in punk music!!  So obviously, LZ fans, this music is not for you, so just back off and let GD fans enjoy their music without being told they have no brain.
B000002TQV|5.0|I absolutely love The Bends. Next to OK Computer I would say that this is their finest accomplishment. There is not a single bad track here...but my favorites include: The Bends, High and Dry, Fake Plastic Trees, (Nice Dream), My Iron Lung, and Black Star. I am writing this review to help get this album back to a 5 star average review, but more so because I love the music that Radiohead makes. Do not hesitate to get this album!
1400032717|4.0|I couldn't put this book down. The character of Christopher was so loveable, and yet so frustrating, mirroring what it must be like to care for someone with autism. My heart went out to his mother, unable to hug or comfort her son, and his father, a divorcee grapling with raising an autistic child on his own. The novel is at once heartwarming, laugh-out-loud funny, and sad. This is definitly a must-read!
B000FA57N0|5.0|I love this movie, almost as much as the Firefly series that spawned it. If only Joss could bring back the series, I would be in heaven. <br /> <br />I heartily recommend this movie to anyone who loves sci-fi and wry/dark humour.

B000058983|5.0|this is one of the most perfectly realized pieces of music ever recorded.it works on so many different levels it's hard to pin down what makes this album so uniquely beautiful.it's very evocative of the late 60's, but like all great art it transcends time and place.play this album and be delighted and amazed.
B000068CNX|5.0|Welcome to the sophomore season of Friends. This is where the show and its stars truly exploded onto the national consciousness. With the advent of season the second, the cast and crew had finally hit their full stride. Standouts were David Schwimmer and Jennifer Aniston as Ross and Rachel and Lisa Kudrow as Phoebe. The Ross and Rachel romance was the strong impetus of the season and had the fans very much invested in the goings-on of the star-crossed duo. But there was still ample room for the other four characters to shine. Kudrow was exceptional in episodes such as The One Where Heckles Dies and The One Where Old Yeller Dies. The best-friend relationship of Joey and Chandler is delved into in The One With the Prom Video and later in a three- episode arc (with a memorable guest star performance by Adam Goldberg). This season also introduced Monica's second greatest love and very good acting foil, Dr. Richard Burke (as superbly, intelligently played by Tom Selleck). Brooke Shields owes her resulting sitcom to her guest star turn in The One After the Super Bowl. But Jean-Claude Van Damme, Julia Roberts and Chris Isaak left fans with a tepid feeling. It goes to show that Friends is best when it's just about the six characters.<br /><br />Highlight episodes are:<br /><br />The One with Ross's New Girlfriend - the season 2 opener finds Ross and Julie an item, much to the chagrin of Rachel; Chandler goes to Joey's old tailor and is taken advantage of; Phoebe cuts Monica's hair ala Dudley Moore.<br /><br />The One with Five Steaks and an Eggplant - the six are divided over money issues; Chandler picks up a wrong number on his phone and hooks up with a hot girl (the denouement to that storyline is gutbustingly funny).<br /><br />The One Where Ross Finds Out - a drunken Rachel leaves a message on Ross's phone; Monica is Chandler's new trainer, a fact he soon regrets; Phoebe's date won't put out (but he is Joey's god).<br /><br />The One With the Prom Video - an old video tape reveals a college-going Ross and high-schoolers Monica and Rachel (the debut of fat Monica and one of my favorite Chandler jokes \\"so how many cameras were actually on you?\\"); Phoebe states her lobster theory; Joey buys Chandler a friendship bracelet which Chandler doesn't want to wear; Monica is in need of a loan (check out the restaurant manager interviewing Monica right after the opening credits); this is truly a great episode.<br /><br />The One Where Ross and Rachel...You Know - well, it's pretty self-explanatory; also, this is where Monica meets Richard (wherein Richard expounds on the intricacies of the head tilt and the head bob).<br /><br />The One Where Old Yeller Dies - her mom had lied to naive Phoebe about the endings of sad films; Chandler and Joey bond with Richard; Ross freaks out Rachel with his long-term family plans.<br /><br />The included special features here improve upon the first season's. This time, there are 2 episodes with producers commentary (The One With the List and The One With the Prom Video). The box set also contains an interactive map to Monica and Rachel's pad, a friends of Friends video guestbook, a trivia quiz and a dvd-exclusive, uncut version of the Smelly Cat music video. Not bad.<br /><br />There's a reason this show was so well-loved and so much lauded by fans and critics alike. Come sit in for a fun chemistry lesson, as taught by Professors Aniston, Cox, Kudrow, LeBlanc, Perry and Schwimmer.<br /><br />Some fun trivia facts about Friends:<br /><br />The first person approached by the casting crew for Friends was David Schwimmer, the second was Lisa Kudrow.<br /><br />When Matthew Perry auditioned for Friends, he had just shot a pilot for a sitcom about baggage handlers in the year 2020, which fortuitously fell thru.<br /><br />The first cast member to star in a Hollywood movie is Marcel the Monkey.<br /><br />The original concept of the show was to star Joey, Monica, Ross and Rachel. Chandler and Phoebe were only supposed to be supporting roles.<br /><br />The record label wouldn't release the Rembrandts' album unless the band recorded a full-length version of \\"I'll Be There For You.\\" The Rembrandts were reluctant to release the Friends' title tune because the band members felt the song didn't mesh with what they were doing musically.<br /><br />The pilot is the only episode that shows in its entirety the opening credits sequence of the cast frolicking in the fountain. For the rest of the episodes, NBC insisted that scenes from various episodes be pulled into the opening credits, fearing that some viewers might not relate with hip, young folks splish-splashing in a fountain.sed to be supporting roles.<br /><br />The record label wouldn't release the Rembrandts' album unless the band recorded a full-length version of \\"I'll Be There For You.\\" The Rembrandts were reluctant to release the Friends' title tune because the band members felt the song didn't mesh with what they were doing musically.<br /><br />The pilot is the only episode that shows in its entirety the opening credits sequence of the cast frolicking in the fountain.

B00000294R|5.0|He has the voice, style, flow, punch lines, jokes, and he has truth to his rhymes. Now i hate to admit it cause some people will think that im not a real rap fan but i'm a big believer that the beat makes the song. This cd has grimy, dark and gritty beats and some peolpe enjoy that, im not one of those people. Some people hate when rappers go \\"pop\\" and use beats that are flashy and commerical but i love that!! i love club bangers and beats that are \\"soft\\". Seriously think about it, if your with a girl you really think she wants to hear about niggas getting killed. So i like those beats that people say is selling out. Big L does not have one of those beats on this cd, actually i don't like the production on this album at all, but that just goes to show you how great i think big l is. Think is one of my favorite cds of all time. The man just has god givin talent, he rips every song on the cd and i dont unstand why this album isn't talked about the same way that ready to die, illmaitc and all those other classic cd's that i dont feel like typing are. I also love that on this cd you hear a young Jay-z, Mase and Cam'ron. I know that every review says this but they say it cause its true...Big L could have been the greatest of all and its a shame that we will never know.
B0001Z52RU|4.0|Today i own a copy of this movie, my friends talk about it but when i see the movie is starring with Ashton Kutcher I say \\"i gonna give it a chance\\" after see  it you finally think \\"Ashton Kutcher can act\\", the movie is Increbible,stronger,provocative, and very dramatic, normally see Ashton Kutcher in comedy flicks like \\"Dude Where is my car?, \\"Guess Who\\" and the awful\\"My Boss's Daughter\\", or in his show \\"Punk'd\\" but i have to be honest here he delivers one the greatest perofmances of \\"2004\\", this example for actors like Chad Micheal Murray how they must to act, visual are good(very good special effects), the acting is convincing, the direction is also good, so I only have to say \\"go and see  The Butterfly Effect is totally unique experience\\" also starring Amy Smart,Elden Henson,Melora Walters and William Lee Scott.
B000DZIGDU|4.0|Jarhead is isn't the best picture of \\"2005\\" and definitively not the best movie of War and  not the worst too  but i had to admit is very  entretaiment and realistic,Jake Gylenhaal acting in this movie is very good(specially beacuse he was nominated by a Oscar for Brokeback Mountain),also cast with another great actors like the academy award-winner Jamie Foxx for Ray, and the next Fast and the Furious punk \\"Lucas Black\\",Peter Sarsgaard(I only remember this guy from Flightplan),the suporting cast  did fine job specially Jake and Jamie,the story is based on a book writed by Anthony Swofford chacter played by Jake Gylenhaal who go to the war in the middle east desert with his snirple rifle, there is a lot rude  jokes from his partners and very funny scenes, if you are the typical guy who wants a lot of shots ,blood ,explosions,human pieces in your T.V screen then you will be disapointed but thats doesn't mean the movie is a waste of time,the visuals are good the desertic areas looked very good and there is some odd explosions at the end of the movie and looked good too, there is only two deads in the whole movie last dead specially was sad,there is enormuos  diference between the personality  of the chacters in this movie like Jake chacter was calm but with his problems like the infidelity from his  girlfriend or his obsession to masturbating(all the chacters do it too they say it),there is some scenes and quotes remember me \\"Platoon\\" in fact almost  of the chacters of Jarhead have some similar personality(I still didn't read the book)from other War movies, with some funny dialouges and definitively the people waited more from Sam Mendes  but  Jarhead have a lot potencial and worth the see.<br /><br />Story 9/10<br />Acting 9.5/10(Very Good acting here)<br />Direction 8/10<br />Visuals 8/10<br /><br />Overall 8/10
B000E8QVWY|5.0|Mr. Phoenix for my is in the top 10 male performances ever you only had to see him in Gladiator to know what i am talking about, I love  Reese Whiterspoon too, she is very talented, without a doubt my favorite actress ever(both Joaquin and Reese are my favorite actors) and his chacter in the movie was lovely, their make a great duo like Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhall  in Brokeback Mountain,the music is \\"Perfect,Outstanding, Superab...\\", one  things i like  in this movie is the chemistry between Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Whiterspoon thats make the film so powerfull and Flawless ,direction was \\"fantastic\\" this movie deserves to be nominated for best picture too, Walk the line by far is my favorite  flick of this year,there another excellent movies in 2005 like King Kong, Sin City, Star Wars episode 3, Brokeback Mountain, Crash,Munich... i like them but Walk The Line will be my favorite of 2005 and one of my favorites of all time.

B000F5GO0A|4.0|To be honest, when I think of Elephant 6 bands I don't usually think of Balkan folk music. But with the release of Beirut's \\"Gulag Orkestar,\\" I may have to revise my thinking.<br /><br />This new band consists of teenage musician Zach Condon, along with people from Neutral Milk Hotel and A Hawk and a Hacksaw, making bittersweet folkpop and danceable marches. Imagine a band of slightly drunk gypsies on parade, and you'll have the general idea of how it sounds.<br /><br />It opens slow, with a gentle piano and blaring horns. The title track meanders in circles and finally dies away... only to be reborn as a swaying march. Halfway through, Condon joins in with some mournful wails and equally mournful singing.  That turns around in \\"Prenzluerberg,\\" where the singing is just as melancholy, but the music is a cheerier march.<br /><br />From there on, the trio tries out those styles and everything in between -- rattly folk with tambourines and horns, danceable folkpop, and tinkly klezmer music. Yes, tinkly klezmer. They get downright happy in \\"Scenic World,\\" a colorful glockenspiel song that is just barely grounded by some quick violins.<br /><br />After that, \\"Gulah Orkestar\\" is pretty upbeat, with a string of swaying marches and upbeat folk acoustics. The album's finale is a bit of a head-scratcher, though. \\"After the Curtain\\" is a relatively bare-bones song with Condon singing over applause and a dancing glockenspiel. I don't know how to fit that one in.<br /><br />Basically this album is what happens when an American teenager drops out and crosses Eastern Europe, soaking up the folk music as he goes.<br /><br />And it's a good thing Condon's musical talents are being backed by experienced musicians, so we can get a bittersweet, atmospheric taste of whatever he heard there. The main problem is that the less folky songs don't really fit in -- without them, the album would have been a lot better. But as it is, it's a remarkable achievement.<br /><br />Condon has a pretty deep voice for someone so young, and he fills it with the longing and beauty that traditional singing often has. And he's assisted by some very talented musicians: Jeremy Barnes and Heather Trost, both of whom work in the psych-folk band A Hawk and a Hacksaw. So of course, they have a good ear for this sort of thing.<br /><br />So how do they manage? Soundwise, it's like someone took the gypsy out of Gogol Bordello and slapped it on Neutral Milk Hotel. The songs are brimming with violins, horns, accordion, mandolin, pianos, ukeleles, glockenspiel and many others. These instruments are so smoothly blended that it sounds like at least a dozen people are playing at any one time, and that they've played this music their whole lives.<br /><br />\\"Gulag Orkestar\\" is a pretty, heart-tugging album that will make you think of quaint European villages in the springtime. Definitely worth listening to, many times.on has a pretty deep voice for someone so young, and he fills it with the longing and beauty that traditional singing often has.

B00005JNRY|4.0|Great movie as expected from Pixar/Disney. To this reviewer, however, the plot of CARS is lifted, and closely resembles the 1991 Michael J. Fox movie, DOC HOLLYWOOD. With that aside, the animation/CGI is breathtaking and the characters are spot-on excellent. Paul Newman has resisted doing films with special effects, but this one was tailor made for him since its about cars and car racing. The film may be a little long, and some of the humor may not hold the attention of younger children, but it is excellent for the adults and young adults. Pixar has added to their  list, a film destined to be a classic.
B000002BBY|5.0|Oasis truly have a gift for producing good music. Many people dont like Oasis becuase the claim to better than the beatles..... well they are. I base music on the way it sounds and the way it makes me feel not what the lyrics are. Ill admit the beatles had much better lyrics than Oasis but Oasis just plain old sounds better than the beatles. I know many people are going to disagree and take offense to me saying that Oasis are better than the Beatles but its my opinion. Oasis just sounds great and this CD proves it. Rock n Roll at its finest. I didnt think so at first but Oasis has made me believe that they are the best bnad in the world. This is an amazing album and is filled with great songs. I especially love wonderwall in my opinion it is the best song ever written. Morning Glory is also amazing and so is champagne supernova. This song is packed with great tunes. Like I said earlier i base music on sound and the way it makes me feel. This album has an unbeatable sound and makes me feel great. Every time i hear Oasis i jump up and sing along because their sound gets in your head and reverberates through your body. It makes you feel good and at peace with the world <br /> <br />I tried listening to the beatles but they are painful to listen too. their music sounds forced and painful but Oasis has a swagger that the Beatles cant touch. I know this will upset die hard beatles fans but its my opinion. Many people dont realize how good Oasis are because they hate them for claiming to be better than the beatles and have a stereotype against them and refuse to listen to them. Give them a chance and listen and you will fall in love with them like I have. <br /> <br />Now back to the album; its Amazing. Probably the best album ever (maybe Oasis previous album Definitely maybe holds that honor)The three best songs on the album are: Wonderwall, Champagne Supernova, and Morning Glory. Followed by Some might Say and the soft and beautiful Dont look backi in anger. There areother classics such as Hey now, shes electric and cast no shadow. <br /> <br />Buy this album its sounds amazing and it makes you feel great. Sorry if I offended any Beatles fans but give this album a chance.... you wont regret it <br /> <br />Long live Oasis
B000FILW86|5.0|Unlike most CT fans, I got into this band late in their career when I came across their underrated self-titled 1997 disc.  I was disappointed with Special One, but Rockford is rock solid.  Strong hooks and melodies, great songwriting, and the band sounds great.  (My favorite tracks at the moment are Decaf, All those Years, and Perfect Stranger).  I can't believe Zander's voice still sounds so great -- after 25+ years of almost constant touring.
B000E6ESL2|5.0|Wow! I'm always pleasantly surprised when I see that a few brave souls are still making films for intelligent adults. In recent years, the rare treats--for those of us who demand more from movies than we usually get--have included MULHOLLAND DRIVE, SWIMMING POOL, MEMENTO, THE JACKET, GOOD NIGHT AND GOOD LUCK, CAPOTE, BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN, A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE, and...STAY. <br /> <br />This is a fascinating film, and one that demands close attention and multiple viewings. I watched it on the advice of friends whose opinions I trust, and I'm glad I did. Watch closely, and you'll see a great deal. I won't spoil the payoff, but the title of this review is a crucial line of dialogue, spoken by Ewan McGregor near the end of the film. The whole world, indeed! <br /> <br />I'm disappointed that STAY got such negative reviews and did so poorly at the box office, but I can't say I'm surprised. The new generations of American critics and film audiences have been conditioned to expect loud explosions and crude, adolescent humor as entertainment, and a film like this is obviously going to confuse and bore them. But for those of you out there who actually know who Hitchcock, Kurosawa, Antonioni, Fellini, Peter Greenaway and David Lynch are (not to mention Ambrose Bierce), you're in for a feast. There's more going on here than in most of the usual Hollywood \\"product.\\" Stay with STAY--you won't regret it.
B00005JOVH|5.0|A cure has been found for the \\"disease\\" of having mutative genes and this cure is offered to any mutant desirous of being normal. Very quickly, this becomes a hot-button issue for non-mutants and mutants alike as the all-important question surfaces: does being a mutant constitute being diseased? Magneto, not only a mutant advocate but one who believes that mutants are the superior life form on earth, vehemently wants nothing of the cure and, in fact, seeks to annihilate the root of the cure - that being a little boy named Jimmy (Leech), himself a mutant who nullifies other mutants' powers. Magneto also continues to gather his power base, from which to wage his ongoing war against the \\"lesser\\" humanity. Simultaneous to these events, Jean Grey returns, but oh so terribly altered. She is now styled the (Dark) Phoenix and her psychic and telekinetic powers have increased exponentially and are controlled by an amoral persona. The ever beleaguered X-Men find themselves at a crossroad. Due to a catastrophic tragedy, the Xavier School for Gifted Students is in dire jeopardy of closing. Further, The X-Men are divided with the issue of the cure. Some, like Storm, believe there is nothing wrong with being a mutant. Some, like Rogue, just wants to fit in. But in the end, the X-Men must once more band together and protect humanity from Magneto's assaults.<br /><br />X-Men - The Last Stand pulls no punches. Key characters bite the big one in this possibly final installment, raising the angst level (as if it needed it) to new heights. X-Men has always been the comic book standard bearer for social issues and racial dynamics and this second sequel begs the question: what qualifies as humanity? And in comic book reality, with the supposition that mutants are real, as a \\"normal\\", how does one differentiate between persecution and self-preservation? Weighty matters for those who want to delve a little deeper. Me, I watch X-Men for the cool special effects.<br /><br />And what of the special effects? They are expertly awesome. The movie screen seems to show something impossible every 2 minutes and yet, these scenes are conveyed with fantastic realism. If a man could fly, if a woman could control the weather, if a man could manipulate metal - well, this is how it would look.<br /><br />I so enjoyed this movie, from start to finish. The principal actors have had 2 prior films to get to know their roles and by this third outing, they embody their characters with easy conviction. The movie's focus is again firmly on Wolverine and why not, as he's got his own film lined up? But Prof. Xavier, Storm, Magneto and Jean Grey are also given decent camera time. Secondary roles of import are Hank McCoy (the Beast), Bobby Drake (Iceman), and Kitty Pryde (Shadowcat). The cast of X-Men, the Brotherhood and other mutants is so large that short thrift is given to many characters. I wish more time had been devoted to Angel, Colossus, Mystique and Rogue. And I thought Multiple Man was a good guy? And where's Nightcrawler?<br /><br />Things to look for:  Magneto's awesome levitation of a massive bridge; the erudite Beast finally unleashed; that old staple, the Colossus/Wolverine fastball; Iceman vs. Pyro; and my personal favorite, Kitty Pryde takes on the unstoppable Juggernaut.<br /><br />Here's hoping that there's a fourth X-Men and that Gambit and/or Longshot are in it.<br /><br />Helpful hint: stick around until after the closing credits, there's more movie.pecial effects?

B000E97Y6K|5.0|What i can say, king kong was a very cool experience even if you still didn't see the first version of Kong, i'm a big fan of the first Kong, my first impresion of the casting was very very bad  i say \\"Jack Black, pick somebody else but Jack Black\\" okay he was funny in School of Rock but King Kong is not the type of movie for Jack \\"God have mercy\\", Adrein Brody he was great in The Pianist but i was thinking in some more  rude guy not like The Rock but okay if that Peter Jackson wants , Naomi Watts is excellent choice,thinking it will be a unceseary remake specially beacuse some of the new remakes are always a failure(i like remakes but please don't remake The Godfather), direction well Peter Jackson id a very good choice the guy know how to make movies that the only thing will save the movie i say,after the long,long wait for December i finally go to see it, i was sacred but this will have a change too i see it, after see  King Kong was very cool experince and make the best remake i ever see in my life is some way King Kong changed my mind, most of people think King Kong was slow and boring not for me if you are a really fan from the first Kong you will love this one, Jack Black was excellent my first impresion was bad but he surpass all my expectations, Adrein Brody was a good chacter no more no less, Naomi Watts perfect in her role and good suporting cast like Colin Hanks was great he was even  better than Adrein Brody,i like all the chacters in this movie, the direction was \\"Perfect\\", visuals at his best this movie deserves the oscar for best special effects, a excellent buy, Well Done!

B000E97Y6K|5.0|Okay, I admit it: I'm a little bit of a fanboy.  I think you have to be to some extent, though, when going into a movie knowing it's about a giant ape rampaging through New York.  I walked out of the theatre thinking this is the best movie I've ever seen, probably due to the mass assault on my senses.  I knew that idea would be tempered after reflection, but for reviewers to give this movie 1's & 2's is laughable.  What would they rate the Dungeons and Dragons, You Got Served, Kazaam, Gigli, Spice World or Jaws: the Revenge for crying out loud? <br /> <br />Although I don't think any Oscars will be shelled out for the acting in King Kong, I must disagree with those that say the performances were terrible.  I was not a Jack Black fan going into the movie, but I am more so now.  All the other roles were either done well or only suffered from a bit of mis-direction, if you can forgive the play on words.  And I've heard numerous reviewers say how bad the final line of the movie is.  Am I wrong, or isn't the last line taken straight from the original? <br /> <br />Speaking of nods to previous versions, I just had to make mention of the native stage scene.  (I haven't seen it previously mentioned, though I haven't read all 700+ reviews on this site either.)  The costumes for the natives on stage in New York looked very much like the true natives' costumes from the 70s version.  Fans of Kong had to chuckle at that. <br /> <br />As far as the movie's length goes, I had no problems with it.  When I'm shelling out $9 to see a movie, I'll take three hours over two any day, as long as I'm not bored.  I did not find myself squirming once, unlike Lord of the Rings...and I'm very much a Tolkien fan!  Of course, with three hours to work with, I understand those reviewers asking for a little more character thought into just what is going on there at Skull Island.  On the other hand, they of course would have no idea and didn't seem to have much time to think about it. <br /> <br />The brontosaurus (or whatever they are exactly) pile-up, though a great idea, was a little cheesy for my tastes.  As many have already stated, the CGI was a little suspect here and too many people escaped certain death.  That is a problem I have with most action movies these days, though.  The certain death factor can be scaled back a little bit to make it both scary AND believable.  Only one character to my recollection simply found a crevice to hide in until the rolling thunder passed.  Did other reviewers miss the folks that were pulverized into oblivion in that scene, though?  And I understand that there was a need to spur the beasts into a stampede, but enough with the raptors already.  Kong or one of the T-Rex's would have sufficed. <br /> <br />My biggest grief with the movie was the bat scene.  Using one as a hang-glider was just plain bad.  Luckily, the scene is short and thus a little more forgivable.  Don't get me wrong, though.  Whereas the scenes in the city were the highlight of the previous movies, the jungle action was probably the pinnacle of this film, for good or ill.  The bugs scene, probably another nod to the original \\"snake pit\\" footage that was cut due to its grisliness (if I recall correctly) and subsequently lost to time, was utterly disturbing and the effects fantastic. <br /> <br />Speaking of effects, I agree with some reviewers that Kong himself seemed to have slightly varying sizes throughout the movie, but I'm not sure everyone is considering the beast's surroundings.  He's obviously going to look bigger inside a New York theatre as compared to the top of the Empire State Building.  I can certainly forgive a few feet here or there if it's done for good cinematic effect. <br /> <br />Another question mark is the taxi cab chase.  As fun as it was to watch, just what was the character trying to accomplish?  Instead of leaving Kong to his business of smashing a bus all to pieces, he leads him on a romp through the city causing untold amounts of carnage and property damage.  I guess you could argue that he had the best of intentions (draw the beast away from the bus) and, again, didn't have a lot of time to think about the repercussions. <br /> <br />So you must be wondering, after all of the low points I've detailed and the explanations I've given for dubious areas of the film, why I was so high on it walking out.  It cannot be fully explained in words.  The detail of the early city scenes, the character building on the boat, the dramatic build up to the finding of the isle, the sweeping landscapes of the jungle, the terror of the native attack, the dinosaur fight scenes, the vertigo of the airplane assault scenes all must be experienced (preferably in the theater) to be understood.  I even enjoyed the \\"ice skating\\" scene, but then I'm a sucker for whimsical brutes. <br /> <br />Though you can debate the nuances and certain parts of the storyline, I can't see how anyone can reasonably argue that Peter Jackson did a disservice to the Kong franchise with this incarnation.  I would be inclined to say just the opposite: that the atmosphere of the film alone was worth the price of admission.  But hey, take any review with a grain of salt, especially from a self-proclaimed fanboy.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|Possibly the best live cd/dvd ever.  An uncommonly sweet, touching and beautiful tribute to George Harrison--the man and the music.  Clapton and McCartney are highlights among a cast of musical genius.
6305897786|2.0|Many people, when discussing this film, seem to stand on eithier the 'no action = stinks' side of the podium or the 'love Polanski = love everything he touches' side. <br />I myself am neither. I am a Polanski fan but felt 'Ninth Gate' is a somewhat failed attempt at the psychological horror Polanski is capable of. Many works of Polanski, both new and old, excell head and shoulders above this film. Don't misunderstand me. There are nice moments in this film. Some people may fall in love so much with these moments they tend to look over the idiotic moments that can be found here. <br />For those of you wandering how good the film is - please rent first and make up your own mind before buying. There are moments in the film that succumb to Hollywood popish cinema - such as two ridiculous scenes involving a woman floating on air (subtlety be gone) and the horrid burning scene near the finale (way over the top). <br />I really tried to keep this film in my collection of Polanski. But next to films such as 'Repulsion', 'Knife In The Water', 'The Pianist' and others, it seems to fall short. You can see the Polanski touch around the corners here but it seems as if this were more an attempt to cash in on the glory days of his early horror works but reformed for a modern audience - it fits well in with today's hollywood horror, with or without the action. <br />Gladly Polanski reveals, through 'The Pianist', that he can still grab an audience and do so in a realistic gripping manner - a true life horror of sorts - no goofy moments here. For those who are better chilled by a sense of realism, whether in fiction, non-fiction, fantasy context or otherwise, may want to look elsewhere in the Polanski library. Horror fantasy works best in subtle strokes.
B000FBGBPC|5.0|I loved the 3 Days Grace debut and I love this album just as much. Sure, I just bought it and have not yet listened extensively to each and every song, but I know that this sounds similar to what I enjoyed from the first release. The gritty, husky vocals... the soft melodies accented with bombastic electric guitars... the poetic flow of the lyrics: it all adds up to another enjoyable collection of songs.  <br />\\"It's All Over\\" opens with what could be compared to a whisper, but that changes as the alt-metal kicks in. The heavy guitar accents can be found through most of the album. <br />\\"Animal I Have Become\\" is the current single and it is worthy... a whirring melody and angry lyrics serve as an instant hook and the hook never lets go... a great song. <br />\\"Never Too Late\\" is a strikingly sad song as the subject of suicide is taken on... the song poses as an intervention of sorts.  <br />\\"Riot\\" is one of my favorite songs on the disc... not because it is so lyrically adept (it is good... but not great) but because the riffs are quite engaging and the chorus is effectively accentuated by them. <br />My favorite song on the album would have to be the title track... \\"One-X\\" which is a song for the outcasts... whomever they may be. This song is about standing up for yourself even if you get \\"knocked down\\". It starts out with a potentially depressing verse... talking about giving up and thinking you are all alone... but then... walla... on the wings of angst driven guitars the solid posative message unfurls. Great stuff.  <br />So... being a night shift worker, i woke up early to buy this CD... and it was so worth loosing the extra sleep. This is a solid effort... and it is really hard to pick a bad song of the bunch. A touch of grace with an angry edge... indeed.
1591396190|3.0|For those of you interested I strongly recommend the article by the authors (Value Innovation: The Strategic Logic of High Growth, W. Chan Kim, Renee Mauborgne, HBR July 2004) which presented the same concept with fewer examples- it will save you time and money.  <br />I do like the Value Innovation concept. But as the authors highlight you cannot create sustainable competitive advantage this way; the new \\"value-curve\\" can be copied easily by the competitors.  <br /> <br />Also, the concept and framework are not entirely new; all of the examples presented in the book can be explained via the old and true concept of knowing your market/consumers' needs/wishes, and the trend of changes in your market/consumers' needs/wishes. If a firm is truly in-touch with their market/consumers, it can constantly create new sources of value, and change its value proposition as market changes. <br /> <br />The real problem is that firm do not stay in-touch, and that they often fall in love with their original value proposition. No new framework can change this problem. The only cure is financial troubles. Then, the firm keeps a new look at its market and consumers' needs/wishes, and when you reach this point you really don't need a new frawework. Although, the new framework might make the task of presenting your finding to management easier.
B000F48CD8|5.0|I bought this CD on impulse when I heard \\"Steady As She Goes\\" playing in the music store. I am so glad I bought it! This is a great CD! My favorites are: Blue Veins, Steady As She Goes, and Together! Buy it!
B0006IIPIK|3.0|Here's a science fiction film with three big stars constructed in the now common digital approach, meaning none of the sets are \\"real\\" and that the entire backdrop to the film was built by computers and/or blue screens.<br /><br />This film combines the modern technicque with nostalgia (it is set in 1930s New York) with danger and adventure in every scene to show what happens when a group of giant robots invades New York. The plot focuses on air ace Sky Captain (Jude Law) and his relationship with intrepid reporter Polly Perkins (Gwyneth Paltrow) who eventually globetrot in efforts to track down and eliminate the robotic menace and its creator.<br /><br />Angelina Jolie has a role as a hotshot space captain in the back half of the movie and  character actor Giovanni Ribisi, whom you may remember starting out as a relative on the TV series \\"Friends\\", also has a supporting role.<br /><br />None of the stars are taxed by their roles because this movie is basically a cartoon on celluloid. The plot has some excitement but overplays its hand after an hour, when its intricacies are too many and you lose interest. The digital production creates a dark film noorish background completely unsuitable for sci-fi, where we are supposed to be able to see everyone and everything with crystal clarity.<br /><br />I had high hopes for this flick after seeing the ending a couple times on digital cable. But after sitting through the entire hour and 38 mintues, I wouldn't recommend you spend much money on it. A rental, maybe; a purchase, out of the question. With its star power and sci-fi adventure plot, I thought this  would be a fun night that could perhaps be repeated a couple times. As it turned out, I lost interest completely after an hour.
B000C4SHRW|4.0|Abhorsen was a sequel to Lirael. It finishes the other half of the story that Lirael started. Basically, things get put together in this book. People make connections. It starts out with Sabriel and Touchstone going south over The Wall to figure out what is going on there, then they get ambushed and have to hide from an evil turned politician. Meanwhile Sam is still out of the Kingdom, looking for his friend Nicholas, and has tagged along with Lirael, who is currently headed to the Red Lake to stop whatever evil is brewing there. In the meantime, they stay at Abhorsen's house to take shelter from the enemy for a while. It is there that the truth is found that Sam is not the Abhorsen-in-waiting, but indeed a descendant of the Wallmakers, Lirael is in fact the Abhorsen-in-waiting, and a sister to Sabriel. With bits and pieces of information gathered, they realize that Nicholas and the evil brewing are linked together. So they set off and get to the Red Lake as fast as they can. But when they get there, they are faced with an evil necromancer who is digging up something that should be left in the ground, and is using Nicholas as help. Lirael and Sam have to stop the Evil before it gets over the wall. And where are Sabriel and Touchstone? I thought this book was very good, but not the best out of the three. There was definitely tension and suspense. A lot of action, but there was something about it that made it different from the other books. I don't know its kind of hard to explain. There were different plans, different styles. Once again though, you started out with frayed beginnings, and in the end they all came together and made sense. I have found that that is a theme in Garth Nix's books. I really enjoyed this book, it had the most action and answers of the whole thing. I decided to read the series again, because now I know things and it just helped to understand a lot better what happened and who was in the story and why they were there. It's a great ending to adifficult and long story.
B000F6IOBQ|2.0|I saw this movie in the Theater and that is why I purchased it from Amazon.com.  The movie itself is great, however, I never received my movie.  It is almost impossible to contact Amazon.com without clicking on link to link under their supposed \\"help\\" section.  My e-mails have been avoided and Amazon.com has already taken my money.  The tracking information is incomplete and the \\"Phone Me\\" section does not work at Amazon.com.  I have sent two e-mails already for two days and no response, no movie.  Buyers beware, Amazon.com is no longer reliable.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I recently viewed North and South.  This was a beautifully performed.  I have not read the book and will defer such comparisons to those who have.  I felt that this story explored many relationships that had great significance outside those of the love story itself.  There was the self doubt of Mr. Hales regarding the church, the fondness of a long time servant that \\"stepped out of line\\", the tight relationship of a mother and son, the begging of a daughter (Fanny) to be noticed by her family, the struggle and rise of the middle class, and the gradual growth of friendship between the \\"master\\" and Higgins.  I feel that these relationships brought color and depth to the otherwise lovable but predicable romantic aspect. <br /> <br />I found it interesting that Margaret was often standing in her scenes.  Also, she looked down alot when lost for words.  This may have been a deliberate acting gesture to express the emotional load that she assumed thru the story.  I would have liked to see more emphasis on Thorton visiting Higgins.  This is the first time in the movie that he noticably smiles--at the begging child.  He was obviously reaching into his past.  It was from then on that he became more \\"human\\" and softer gestures along with smiling were incorporated into his character. <br /> <br />The only other comment I have is on the final scene.  It is a lovely scene at the train station--very soft and touching.  However, his physically turning away because he couldn't bear to see her go back to the \\"London\\" train could have been emphasized.  This,with the subsequent realization of seeing her reflection in the window along with the relief that she had not rejected him again, could have been stronger. The final shot showed her gazing out the window--NOT SMILING, and him looking down.  I would have liked to see them at least happier.  Having said that, I truly enjoyed the performances and recommend North and South highly.
B000002H97|4.0|Metallica's self-titled album was their entrance to the mainstream and bade farewell to their more epic thrash origins.  While it might not be as good as Master Of Puppets or Kill 'Em All, it is still a very good listen.  Metallica decided to write the polar opposite of their previous album, And Justice For All.  Instead of writing 9 songs of 63 minutes in length, Metallica wrote songs that were shorter but still were heavy and catchy.  To the people that said Metallica sold out- what is the problem with writing something that's catchy?   <br /> <br />Bob Rock is a large contributor to this album, although he did not play on the album.  Bob Rock did a wonderful job producing- all the instruments are loud and sound great.  Bob also steered Metallica from the excessively long riffs and bridges of their previous album so it is in many ways, better than Justice. <br /> <br />For all the reviews saying that this album is 'not metal', that's completely wrong.  The riffs, the main part of any Metallica song, are still heavy, and the solos are great.  The controversy is over The Unforgiven and Nothing Else Matters, two ballads that show a new side of Metallica.  Unlike the hair metallers before them, like Motley Crue, Metallica comes off as sincere and 'from the heart'.  James actually tries to sing, which isn't that bad. <br /> <br />Overall, this album is pretty good.  It is a great starting point for new Metallica fans, as it bridges the older stuff, as well as their later stuff, like Load and Reload.  Highy recommended!
B000FFJ85I|5.0|This will be the best CD of 2006! AFI have totally reinvented themselves. Davey Havok has great and better vocals, plus, the guitars and bass are awesome. THe beginning of the album is PRELUDE 12/21, ag reat opener, and then we have KILL CAUSTIC, the best song onnthe CD. It ends with ENDLESSLY SHE SAID, a great closer. Do yourself a favor and pick this up.
B000F5GNX8|4.0|An homage to the classic noir detective thrillers, this film boasts fine performances by all involved, especially Downey and Kilmer.<br /><br />It's a who-done-it gift-wrapped in sharp dialogue, understated wit, and a fast-moving plot, delivered with beautiful cinematography.<br /><br />Don't miss it.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Ok, so maybe 'stunning' isn't the first word that comes to mind when listening to the album for the first time.  Maybe 'interesting' is more appropriate.  But the album suddenly, on the second or even third listen, just grips you and blows you away.    The opening chords to 'Airbag' no longer sound clashed, but simply aggressive.  The meandering music and lyrics of 'Homesick Subterranean Alien' no longer sound without purpose, simply lost and isolated.  And the mumbling 'Exit music (for a film)' now sounds frustrated.    In fact, with every single listen, more and more of the magic of this album is revealed, more of the (in some cases) subtle emotion and overwhelming feeling of hopelessness and frustration shows through.  Every time the record presents something new.    And there is not one single track which could be removed from the album without depleting it in some way.  Similarly, I don't have a favourite, or least favourite song, nor any that I skip through when I listen to it.  The album is that good.  Every song is sublime, stunning, and terribly beautiful.    People have said that Radiohead will never top this record.  But why would they be able to? They have, in this album, made the best record ever.  They have created an album which is as near to being perfect as it is possible to be.  How can we expect them to top that?  In 'OK Computer' the band have found the perfect, delicate balance between oddity and appeal.  This shows as the album changes from the very 'non-mainstream' 'Exit Music (for a film)' straight to the pop-rock 'Let Down'.    And I'm not some die-hard Radiohead fan either.  Sure, I like 'The Bends' and 'Kid A', but I don't own all of their albums.  I haven't bought any of their work since the release of Kid A.  This isn't my favourite album, either - that award would go to 'Appetite for Destruction'.  So, in that respect, I'm a neutral who just recognises that this album is a masterpiece.    You have to buy this album.  In twenty, thirty years when you dig out all your old CDs, albums by 'Fall Out Boy', 'Kanye West' and 'Green Day' will seem unremarkable, if not rubbish.  But this album will not.  It is timeless.  When your kids start laughing at the kind of music you used to listen to, just play them this.  That'll shut them up.

B000FIMG68|5.0|Never before has a show encompassed so many aspects of what truly makes television a medium to behold. The acting, the writing, the development, the direction, everything about this multi-genre, multi-award winning show has to be seen to be believed. <br />I bought the first series on DVD not having any interest in the show when it was on TV here in Australia. I rented the first disc to watch it and see for myself, from the first 5 minutes I was hooked. This show is an instantaneous classic, and not only does the second series IMPROVE on the first, it also expands the rich tapestry of backstories and mystery surrounding our characters and the Island. <br /> <br />A must buy. I can't wait to own it.
B000BM6AVA|3.0|My neighbour bought this album last year when it came out. Ever since then, I have not stopped hearing System of A Down blasting in my ears. I wake up at night with Hypnotize in my head! So I guess I wasted a few dollars buying the CD for myself then..    Vicinity of Obscenity is one of my favourites. It is hilarious, and intentionally so. My second favourite is She's Like Heroin. However, my liking for the rest of the songs drop from there. The sad songs aren't really sad. Chop Suey was an emotionally packed song. There are none of those on this album. Also, the political propaganda spewed in nearly EVERY song is TIRESOME!     Oh yeah, and what's with the guitarist starting to sing now? His voice is high-pitched and whiny, I don't like it. Old SOAD ruled!
B00005JNRY|4.0|My five year old enjoyed this one a lot, she was very entertained, so the target audience will probably be giving this a five star rating.<br /><br />I knocked it down a bit just because of the general cornyness (if that's a real word) of the movie, which also meant a bit contrived and a bit predictable, etc.<br /><br />However, I'll be buying the dvd and I do give it a strong recommendation, go take the kids to see it at the movies, it was wholesome and fun and all that.
B00004U2G4|5.0|I own 5 Jeff Beck albums and in a way, this one is the most fascinating of them.  Possibly because as a Led Zeppelin fan, this album is soundwise, a precurser to Led Zeppelin.  That being said, it has a life and fire all it's own.  Jeff Beck is one of the greatest guitarists ever to pick up the instrument.  The album keeps me whipping along, though I get a little lost on \\"Old Man River\\".   <br /> <br />\\"Shape of Things\\" is a great re-working of the Yardbirds tune.  This is the introduction of the world to Rod Stewart, who sings with a passion that does this song justice.  The song was also covered in this form by Gary Moore and Jimmy Page and the Black Crowes. <br /> <br />\\"Let Me Love You\\" is another great tune.  Comes in with a rocking guitar riff and contains some tasty guitar and vocal interplay between Beck and Stewart.   <br /> <br />\\"Morning Dew\\" fades in with a haunting sound  followed by a bass and drum beat before going into the song.  The song, while played in a major key, has an extremely haunting flavor to it.  A prime cut from the band. <br /> <br />\\"You Shook Me\\"-This is NOTHING like the Led Zeppelin version.  Jeff Beck boasts that he wanted to make the rudest and sickest sounds with his guitar on this song.  And he did that.  It is sad that this song became a major point of contension between Beck and Page when Page recorded his own version for Zeppelin.  Back on topic though, this is a great rendition of the song and is worth listening to just to juxtapose with Zeppelin. <br /> <br />\\"Old Man River\\"-Probably my least favorite track from the album.  In this case, the only real positive is the fact that Rod Stewart sings it with such passion.  Sadly, he hasn't sung with that kind of passion since his early solo/Faces days. <br /> <br />\\"Greensleeves\\"-Not familiar with the traditional version, but I love the way Beck takes some time to show off his skills on an acoustic guitar.  It has a very medieval and majestic feel to it.   <br /> <br />\\"Rock My Plimsoul\\"-Back to the straightahead blues rock.  Another track with vocal and guitar interplay between Beck and Stewart.  Beck's guitar playing was top notch here. <br /> <br />\\"Beck's Bolero\\"-An excellent instrumental featuring Jeff Beck, Jimmy Page, John Paul Jones and Keith Moon.  The interplay between Beck and Page alone make this one worthwhile, however everybody contributed greatly.  It is very evocative of early Zeppelin.  This track was not recorded during the \\"Truth\\" sessions.  There are some differing accounts to when it was recorded.  Probably in 1966 or 1967.  Another point of contension between Beck and Page.  Mainly over the writing credit.  This bolero rhythm was used on \\"How Many More Times\\" from Zeppelin I. <br /> <br />\\"Blues Deluxe\\"-The longest track on the album.  This is supposed to be the blues in a live setting, however, many believe that the audience was dubbed in to give it the feel of a live track.  However it is still a great track.  Being the longest song on the album, it has the feel of being improvised.  Joe Bonamassa also covered this song for his album of the same name.   <br /> <br />\\"I Ain't Superstitious\\"-IMO, the best track on the album.  The leads that Beck pulls out during the course of this song are great.  In many ways this is the tastiest sounding Beck's guitar playing has been during the course of this album.  Stewart's voice here shows that he was meant to be a bluesman.  And the grand finale capped this song off well.  Megadeth also covered this song for their 1986 album \\"Peace Sells...But Who's Buying\\".
0679422714|2.0|The greatest quality of this book is surely the research that was done and the previously inaccessible witnesses the authors were able to speak to. It would have been better had their project remained at that level to be incorporated into existing historical analysis.  <br /> <br />This book clearly breaks new ground but it does so in a way that fails to incorporate existing historical research into Mao and communist China. Certainly the argument that traditional historians have failed to understand the period and the man is legitimate, but it is difficult to believe that historians have failed quite so spectacularly, since the book does not claim to add a fresh insight to one specific historical event but to overturn established research on dozens of major historical flashpoints including the Long March, Lin Biao's death, and the power of the Gang of Four in Mao's last days. This makes it, at least, a bad historical work. <br /> <br />The fact that the authors demonstrate a prejudice in presenting their evidence makes it, moreover, a badly argued book. The horrors of Mao should speak for themselves yet the authors feel the need to remind us of his evil by minimizing the atrocities committed by others (Chiang Kai-shek for one). This double standard inserts doubt into our minds as to the accuracy of the information presentend, undermining the book's original intention.  <br /> <br />Finally the book is badly written in so much as it presents an implausible account of Mao. Half the book is devoted to his megalomania, incompetence, and general evil-ness while the other half is devoted to his acquisition of power. This dichotomy, between a man who achieved so much (by destroying so much) who is nevertheless bad at economics, bad at speaking, and in every way unlikable is never resolved and hence leaves one feeling hoodwinked.  <br /> <br />I have to give the book two stars because anyone interested in Mao or communist China should read it for the sake of all the new evidence the authors uncovered. The reader must be forewarned however that this should be the only reason he is reading the book.
B0009IW88A|5.0|Tim Burton's Batman is very much like Danny Elfman's score for it: over-the-top, obvious, and gaudy. Similarly, Nolan's Batman is like Hans Zimmer's and James Newton-Howard's music in that it is subtle, believable, and absolutely wonderful.     Batman Begins, in my own, humble, opinion, was one of the best movies last year only because it didn't seem to be written as \\"a super-hero movie\\" but instead as a uniquely human story whose protagonist just happened to be one Bruce Wayne. If you enjoyed the film, the music will not disappoint. With its especially dark and haunting feel, and occasional heart-pounding action sequences, the music matches the film perfectly. Underneath the low, dark, themes, exceptionally warm, lush, and strangely human string melodies occasionally emerge, helping to establish the fact that the focus of the movie truly is on the characters themselves and the individual relationships they have with one another. These motifs are spread out strategically through the soundtrack and are slightly scarce, making them all the more heartbreakingly beautiful when they do eventually surface.    As a huge fan of both Zimmer and Newton-Howard, it was especially entertaining for me to listen to the score and pick out the aspects of it that resembled more Zimmer's technique and more Newton-Howard's. I tend to enjoy James Newton-Howard's quieter works (such as the work he's done with M. Night Shyamalan) and Hans Zimmer's grander ones (like The Last Samurai) and was amazed how well these two styles meshed together. They complimented each other wonderfully and I was left wanting more. I only hope that the two will collaborate again in the future.     If you are sick of movies and the music that goes with them, that hit you over the head with the loud, grand, ostentatious, brass-filled themes, and are looking for something better, then Batman Begins is the soundtrack for you.
B000F3AAUW|4.0|Gnarls Barkley - St. Elsewhere (Downtown, 2006) <br /> <br />If you picked up Danger Doom's (MF Doom and producer Danger Mouse) album, The Mouse and the Mask, you heard \\"Benzie Box\\" featuring Cee-lo singing the chorus. If you liked that combination of Cee-lo over a Danger Mouse beat, you'll love St. Elsewhere, where the album contains nothing but these pairings under the name Gnarls Barkley. <br /> <br />By now you've already heard \\"Crazy\\" but there are other great songs on here. \\"Who Cares?\\" has to be the best track, though, as Cee-lo laments, \\"Everybody is somebody/But nobody wants to be themselves/And if I ever want to understand me/I have to talk to someone else.\\" <br /> <br />Danger Mouse hooks Cee-lo up with obscure old-school backdrops while Cee-lo croons his heart out. He doesn't rap much on here but for a good rap, check out \\"Feng Shui\\". <br /> <br />This album really ain't for everybody (but if you ever heard Danger Mouse's productions or Cee-lo's albums, you know that even their own stuff ain't for everybody). Even I am still getting used to one or two of the songs; that's why I didn't give this a full five stars. Ask me about this in five months and my fondness might have grown but for now, St. Elsewhere's hype is justified. -EJR

0385510438|4.0|This novel weaves a tale of race relations and the social anatomy in the South in a very \\"Faulkner-esque\\" way, finally giving Grisham the ability to move up from the status of a lawyer who writes legal thrillers to a true novelist who has obviously studied the human condition.  It's the story of the relationship between Willie, who is considered a YANKY though he's from Memphis, and Callie, a black woman who raised 8 children, several of whom got their doctorate degrees.  Callie, though not herself college-educated, has the adorable habit of noting grammatical errors and typos in the local newspaper that Willie owns, and she befriends Willie and even tries to disuade him from his \\"heathenistic\\" ways by dragging him off to her church, which he finds he actually enjoys.  Their relationship is one to be applauded and truly gives the reader a picture of what it must have been like to live in the Deep South in the 1970s in a way that makes one think.<br /><br />Though this novel doesn't have as much suspense as The Firm, A Time to Killer, or Runaway Jury, it's a novel worthy of many accolades and definitely worth the reader's time!<br /><br />BRAVO, MR. GRISHAM!  HOPE TO READ MORE THOUGHT-PROVOKING TALES LIKE THIS!<br /><br />Lynne Logan<br /><br />Author of The Crime Chronicles of Decker Zane
B000001Y2U|5.0|I am not a Manson fan, I don't own Manson T-Shirts, Posters, Patches, Bobble heads ETC.. And I normally stick with Heavy Metal and steer clear of the Hard Rock genre. But this is an extremely creative and innoventive album by Manson and his troops. To simply say HE is a bad person or his lyrical content makes this album bad is foolish and not true what-so-ever. The guy has alot of talent as a writer and musician.<br /><br />The band shows true signs of talent here that is not shown on any other of their albums. Whether it be Anthem-like drumming or gritty bass and guitar they always show it off in good taste. Dark over tones are through out the album reguardless of track tempo. Manson himself is a very good and original vocalist and is far from copying the styles of the mighty Trent Reznor.<br /><br />\\"Beautiful People\\" on its own will keep this album alive for years to come and when the MM generation get older it will still be heard on the Radio frequently. \\"Antichrist Superstar\\" is easily my favorite track on the album with its Head Banging, Pump your fist atmosphere in which was practically an instant classic for MM Live performances.<br /><br />To all the Anti-Manson posters, This band is very talented and you can't see past your own beliefs to see this. Besides, I listen to Metal bands that openly consider themselves Satanists and play across the US constantly.. Yet they don't have any Anti-Satanist supporter rallys outside their concerts.. God forbid if someone speaks their mind and gets abit of spotlight.. Seriously, People like you are the reason Wars happen!<br /><br />=IN=ICED=FLAMES=
B000FBGBPC|5.0|Every song on this album rocks! I definatley recommend anyone who enjoys rock to pick up this record. The vocals are great, guitar is wonderful and the overal sound of this album is excellent. I believe the boys of 3DG put full effort into One-X. This album seems more mature than their first one. Check it out and you will not be dissapointed!

B00005JNJV|5.0|Two words one name Christian Bale.....<br /><br />Job well donei thought to myself why would i want to see a movie about how it was in the beginning but i'm glad i still watch it, Beautiful cinematography. Great acting. Great story. This is how Batman should be done!<br /><br />I love the other batman mostly of course Micheal Keaton but Christian Bale did a great job
6304696515|5.0|I am not often very interested in stories taking place in pre-industrial times. I like technology too much, and I find that human interactions without even a telephone are just too limited. But there are exceptions, for instance Dangerous Liaisons, which is just a wonderful story. <br /> <br />It is based on a novel of the same title written and taking place in France before the revolution, in the highly decadent upper class society. The same story was filmed at the same time in another very good movie, Valmont. <br /> <br />Apart from beautiful cinematography and great acting, the story is gripping and has wonderful characters, particularly the two main characters (played by Glenn Close and John Malkovich) who are perhaps the best *nasty* characters in any story ever. They are just really slimy. And yet they they can feel love and regret, which of course are weaknesses in really nasty people, and this leads to their downfall. <br /> <br />Having Michelle Pfeiffer and Uma Thurman as some of their innocent victims does not hurt either. (Warning, if you don't like the prospect of Uma Thurman topless, don't watch this one.) <br /> <br />It was many years since I saw it in the cinema, I was curious if it held up. It did. Warmly recommended.

B000000W5N|1.0|OK EVERYONE, READ MY REVIEW, <br /> <br />THE ROLLING STONES WERE ONE OF THE STUPIDEST BANDS ON THE PLANET <br />NEXT TO THE BEATLES AND ZEPPELIN. THEY HAVE ONLY MADE 2 GOOD SONGS IN SHATTERED, AND START ME UP. THEIR MUSIC IS PLAIN BORING <br />AND STUPID. THEY ARE JUST OVERRATED!!!!!!! SO PEOPLE WHO LIKE <br />THIS BAND ARE IDOLS!!!!! THIS MUSIC IS PLAIN BAD....DIRE STRAITS <br />IS GOD.. MY FAVORITE SONG IS HEAVY FUEL BY DIRE STRAITS. <br />THANK YOU AND VOTE YES!!!!!

B00004ZAV3|1.0|What can I say about Dire Straits? They were the greatest band <br />in history and they sure rock pretty hard. To the Beatles...this <br />compilation ooh man sucks!

B000B6CODO|4.0|How can u not like JUMANJI alot of action and fun it almost makes u feel like your playing the game with them
0141301074|4.0|This book is very funny because it's about these two twits who <br />start playing tricks on each other. It started when Mrs. Twit purposly put her glass eye in Mr.Twit's beer. The pranks get better and funnier throughout the story. My favorite prank in the story was probably when Mr.Twit put glue on the tree and the birds stuck to it. Then Mrs. Twit made a bird pie. But the birds and monkeys fought back by glueing the whole living room upside down. IF YOU LOVE FUNNY BOOKS READ THIS BOOK!
B00005JKCH|4.0|I just love Spider-Man! It was a great movie I thought! I have it on DVD and I love watching it! Tobey Maguire was great as Peter Parker!<br /><br />I know at one point Freddie Prinze Jr wanted to play the roll and didn't get it but i really can't picture anybody now other than Toby playing spider man
B000F5GNX8|5.0|This film opened under the radar and I simply don't know why. Critics gave it for the most part good reviews. The one's that didn't named no reason as to why. <br />I went out of my way to see this and was glad I did. The audience of ALL ages laughed so loud and so long I missed a few hundred jokes, but that didn't detract from the movie there is so much so fast so funny so furious you HAVE to see it again. It's that good. <br />It's a noir satire, L.A movie biz satire, L.A. satire with the best performances by both the lead actors ever given. There is this desperation by it's main characters that carries over into the film that is similar to Max Bialistock's greed in the Producers. I am going to buy the dvd and will see how it plays at home but just looking back at the experience of seeing it makes me laugh. Other reveiws will illuminate the story for you but I am more interested in giving others a reason to see this. Sadly theaters make it cheaper easier to buy the movies, usually uncut delivered to your home rather than going out to see them so get some friends and watch the movie. Bring a box of kleenex for the tears of laughter. This is going to make fools of those in the biz who did not market the movie better.
0823016714|5.0|'Facial Expressions' is an excellent reference book for artists who want to practise drawing and sketching the human face, enlivened by any number of evocative expressions. I am using it to improve my figure drawing, and to give the anthro characters I like to try and draw some life... it's great for that! <br /> <br />The models cover a huge cross section, ranging from around 20 to the late 70's, both male and female. The expressions cover a wide range also, and there are more than enough angles to get the pose down. <br /> <br />If you're a developing artist - like me - who struggles with the expressive human face - and particularly if you want to do anthro or furry art - I think this book is a must!
0446310786|5.0|I have read, reread the book and viewed the movie at least 30 times.  In the story, Atticus Finch, who is the protagonist,  represents to me the most wonderful fantasy father. He has shown me a sense of safety, integrity, morality and the story made me want to be a better person.  In our lives today, we need real life examples of heroes like Atticus Finch.  The book and/or movie has consistently saved me from giving up on humanity. Bless you Harper Lee.<br />Sherri Rosen<br />Sherri Rosen Publicity, LLC, NYC
B000EYK4GW|2.0|Don't get me wrong, Dumbo is a great movie for kids and adults, one of Disney's greatest films but everything went wrong in this SO CALLED \\"Big Top Edition\\"<br /><br />First of all, it isn't even a 2-disc set!<br /><br />Most of the old \\"60th Anniversary Edition\\" bonus features are put on this DVD taking out some of the making, Dumbo II preview, and a music video. I do not understand Disnet AT ALL!<br /><br />The new transfer IMO is WORSE then the \\"60th Anniversary Edition\\" It has no life to it, it is darker and very dull. Also you are losing 30% of the film do to an overscan! This movie was already filmed in fullscreen why do a pan and scan job to a fullscreen DVD? Come on Disney, you get enough money!<br /><br />You really need this quick buck?<br /><br />If you already have the \\"60th Anniversary Edition\\" DVD please stick with it! You get to see the WHOLE movie in full and the colors are brighter and you have ALL the great bonus features!
0060853964|4.0|...and it's funnier than ever. Hell is sending baby Antichrist to earth for the final battle. But between mixed-up Satanists, an angel and a demon that have grown rather fond of the world as it is, and the world's most adorable Hellhound (and many, many more...), things get a bit complicated. Gaiman and Pratchett have created a wonderful story filled with the most amazingly odd characters and the best take of good and evil I've read in a long time. <br />A light and funny read, highly recommended
B000AMJDHY|5.0|Really, you don't need all that much information here. You can read all the reviews on exactly what kind of music this is, or what genre it fits into, but it really doesn't fit anywhere. With incomprehensible track titles and beat mixes you don't hear everyday, just give it a listen and you'll understand what I mean. Don't try to classify Panic! because they are just a wonderfully refreshing young band that will be sure to bring more original and entertaining music in due time.

B0007OCG56|2.0|Spanglish was a movie that had all the elements necessary for a great romantic comedy and didn't live up to its potential. After watching the commercials for it on TV, with the overwight daughter, the alchoholic grandmother and the overall messed up but rich family, I felt the story left much to be desired overall and was incomplete.<br /><br />The story is narrated to us by Flor's daughter. Despite this, her character is left a blank throughout much of the story, being much more an object than a character. The main character of interest is, of course, the mother. She cannot speak English, however and there aren't any subtitles. Despite this, you imediately sympathise with her and she is much easier to understand than the rest of the cast.<br /><br />The family poses the largest problem. The father, first presented as a wimpy nice-guys-finish-last type is by the endthe same as when he started. He is so passive throughout the whole film you want to shake some sense into him. But they try to convince you he is perfect. The mother on the other hand is incredibly annoying, and by the end she hasn't changed one jot either. She's superficial, selfish and arrogant. The daughter was wonderful, but the ideas of her being overweight are dumped on you the first half-hour, than she disappears entirely from the story and appears again at the end for five minutes. Her problems have not been resolved either. The boy had nothing to do with anything and the grandmother suddenly says near the end 'I quit drinking a month ago' and that's that.<br /><br />Ultimately, the story was really about nothing more than a maid who went to work for some people and left. She didn't change their lives. They didn't change theirs. The story may very well not have happened. The only significant change was that of the daughter, which was told more than shown, and the daughter had such little involvement in the story in the first place, you find yourself not really caring.<br /><br />I did like the themes of sacrificing for your children and staying true to your culture and family. When her loveable daughter started to be become the all-American Valley-girl stereotype I felt truly appaled and was pleased at the way it was all resolved.<br /><br />In the end, it was an enjoyable movie. Long, but enjoyable. A rediculously large portion of it was spent with the huge fights between Flor and her employers, which was really silly and unneeded. So much was brought into the movie you kept waiting for any sort of resolution, but none ever came. When it ended, you have this feeling of, what was the point? I don't mind open endings, but these were serious oversights and huge plot holes. Why does it matter that he doesn't want his restautrant promoted to a four-star, and then after it gets promoted, he does nothing. Why was that even brough in? It was all very...anti-climactic.<br /><br />But for a weekend, this is a good movie to watch, with some nice romantic scenes and a feel-good quality overall.the themes of sacrificing for your children and staying true to your culture and family.

B0002W18MU|5.0|I got my listen from a friend who is reviewing this cd for a magazine, and it's bittersweet to hear Cash's voice singing new songs.  The songs are almost autobigraphical- in his last years Johnny was ill, he lost June, and he held onto his faith with an iron grip. You can hear the pain in his voice on \\"Love's Been Good to Me\\" and \\"Rose of My Heart\\". There's a sense of satisfaction and contentment in \\"Further on Up the Road\\" and \\"Four Strong Winds\\". If you enjoyed Cash's last four CDs, this one will fit in well with your collection. I was a big fan of Cash's- in fact, when he died, Newsweek published my letter expressing how much of a loss to the music world it was when he passed away. Am I biased? Heck, yes. But I'd like to think that even if you're a new Cash fan, this CD would be a great introduction.
B000FQJAIW|5.0|So George Lucas FINALLY caved and is giving us what he should have given us when the Star Wars trilogy was originally released on DVD- the ORIGINAL theatrical versions!!!! Yea!!! George is saving face a bit after having said he'd \\"never\\" release the original versions again, by making these \\"limited edition\\" DVDs.    Have Star Wars fans reached their saturation point? I'm sure some have, but this Star Wars fan will be buying these 3 DVD sets the day they are released. OK, so I haven't seen these DVDs yet, and I already own the trilogy in no less than FIVE different sets (VHS, LD, DVD) but I'm STILL excited!    EDIT: Since writing this reveiw, I've learned that the DVDs will be made from NON-ANAMORPHIC LASERDISC MASTERS FROM 1993!? WTF??  GEORGE LUCAS-- YOU SUCK! :(
B00004U2G4|5.0|This  is one of those albums/CD's that you can put on and just sit back and enjoy. No skipping ahead to the \\"good tracks\\" as they are all good. I first heard this album back in my childhood as my older sister had this on vinyl. I rediscovered it in the late eighties and  even today it does not sound dated. Rod Stewart is in fine form on this as is Beck. Awesome stuff. I disagree with the last review. \\"Old Man River\\" works for me just fine. \\"Ain't Superstious\\" is perhaps my fav.
B0007P0LPC|5.0|Nureyev had a wonderfully keen practical and artistic sense of how to produce the classical ballets.  Among other things, he realized the merits of enlarging the role of the male dancer, as did Balanchine, his quote to the contrary notwithstanding!(Male dancers who danced for him that I have trained with, tell me that when he said ballet is all about women, he was mostly referring to the concept of partnering, where the woman is prominently displayed;  he enjoyed working with male dancers very much, as we can see in his choreography.)  In this version, both principal dancers are given a great deal of choreography and, as one would expect from one of the world's most famous ballet duos, they dance magnificently!  Margot Fonteyn was always the quintessential ballerina, both on stage and off.  She was also a great balletic actress and did not like to be disturbed backstage during a ballet because she would stay in character.  She always peformed at her best, right up to the end of her very long career.<br />Some people have been surprised at the closeup of Nureyev in this at the begining of the first act; it shows the starkness of his makeup.  Actually, this type of makeup is often used for this role, but we usually don't see it in closeup!  It looks good at a distance.  It is all part of the fantasy aspect of Swan Lake.<br />Especially noteworthy is the adagio Nureyev dances at the end of act one.  Many dancers have bought this version just to see and study this!  It is one of the greatest moments in classical ballet!<br />Nureyev's handling of the corps de ballet is also fantastic.  I loved the geometric patterns he sets for them.  The corps also dances with great precision and passion.<br />The only subdued aspect of this version is that of the Rothbart character.  He is reduced to just a character role here.  Nureyev liked to have important character, non-dancing , roles in his ballets for balance, no doubt.<br />This recent transfer by DG is marvelous, both visually and acoustically.  I highly recommend this classic performance as a traditional Swan Lake.y.  I highly recommend this classic performance as a traditional Swan Lake.

B0006L16N8|3.0|...why it's simplistic bands like these that end up selling millions upon millions of albums and sell out concerts with tickets that cost $600 apiece. Nowadays, all you have to do is figure out what's popular in the music scene, assemble a group of people who are willing to devote their entire lives to playing boring, repetitive songs every night for the next few years, make a demo, send it to a major label, and you're set until the fads turn to another outlet. That's the mindset that got this particular band into the spotlight. Some people live and die by the name Coldplay, swearing upon the Bible itself that Chris \\"Christ\\" Martin (my nickname for him, seeing as he's become an international icon for almost nothing) and his band are the only reason they live. I even had to analyze the song \\"Fix You\\" in my English class, making me even more bitter against them and against my teacher for giving into the lies. Refreshing? Please. There are hundreds of bands out there just like this, some of them even better, that people have never heard of and aren't willing to listen to because they're too into their favorite trendy pop group. The only reason this band got popular is because they came around at the right time and made known their political views, rallying confused American/British young adults to their cause and branding them with the mark of Coldplay.The members of Coldplay aren't even all that talented, but they make music that sells and people believe that it means something to them. What really bugs me is that they refused multi-million dollar contracts from several large companies who wished to use their songs on commercials, claiming that they \\"wouldn't be able to live with ourselves if we sold the songs' meanings like that\\". Funny, their music already means little when you really think about it, because cliched metaphors and ambigious statements that  COULD have deep meaning are obviously a vie for mainstream signage.<br /><br />So now let's go through what elements of this band causes me to be so angry at them. Frontman Chris Martin is one of the major reasons this band is overrated and annoying. His voice is somewhat soothing and melodic, but he is no way a great vocalist. I can actually replicate his voice to almost exact specifications and play his short, repetitive piano pieces on the piano, proving that even an average teen can play this music. Guitar player Jon Buckland, while appearing on here more often than the previous albums, still doesn't playing very memorable (except maybe the lick from \\"Talk\\", which is enjoyable but EXTREMELY overdone, being played after every verse; in addition, the riff was taken from the Kraftwerk song \\"Computer Love\\", which is pretty pathetic in itself) and is pretty much useless, strumming repetitive three-chord riffs (an overused description, but the truth isn't always interesting) and not much else. Bassist/synthesist Guy Berryman provides some soothing ambience on most of the tracks but isn't that good as a bass player and it's probably better that he rarely makes an appearance, instead focusing on adding some texture to the music, as it badly needs it. Last and most likely least is drummer Will Champion, whose drumming does little more than keep the music from falling apart, and even then it barely does that job. But drumming isn't really important to this music, so I won't hold him responsible for that.<br /><br />Bottom line: I don't really mind the music all that much; in fact, it can be quite soothing and ethereal when I need to get to sleep or something (though I often prefer something heavy and fast to lull me into a slumber, ironically), but the things that this band stands for sparks my anger against them. It disturbs me how popular this band is when they just follow the trends, and meanwhile amazing bands that refuse to sell out gather dust in a distant, isolated European town playing to a small, dedicated crowd who know what real music is. So if you want a good, talentedband with a soft overtone and meaningful lyrics, then don't start here.<br /><br />Track Selections: \\"Talk\\", \\"Speed of Sound\\", and \\"Swallowed in the Sea\\"<br /><br />6/10ft overtone and meaningful lyrics, then don't start here.     Track Selections: \\"Talk\\", \\"Speed of Sound\\", and \\"Swallowed in the Sea\\"    6/10
B000EU1PKK|5.0|I have been a poor student for a long time, but recently I have started to have an income. When I found out the remasters of the helloween albums were coming out, I bought them all immediately.  I have been waiting to do this for a long time, and now is the perfect time for everyone.<br /><br />This particular remaster includes the original album plus the judas single, and then to add extra incentive, they added 7 b sides to a second disc.  The disc one has been re-mastered and sound crisp, and as fresh as the day they were originally penned.  It is the second disc that I want to stress as the best part of the new edition, and makes the investment worth it.  The two versions of ride the sky (remix and Live) are both nice, and murderer remix and guardian live are cool too, But the tracks Oernst Of Life and Metal Invaders from the DEATH METAL compilation are the weight of this remaster. This is the first time the track Oernst has been anywhere easly available to the public since 1984.  I have heard this song only once before this, but I did not have the 50-100 dollars to buy the vinyl Death Metal record to get it.  It is one of the first tracks ever layed down by helloween, and is a classic fast, loud metal song that is a unrecognized gem of the early mid 80's metal days.  The liner notes of this one also starts the story of the fledgling band, and has an interview with Michael Weikath (as do all of the re-masters series) that fills in more interesting facts of the boys from Hamburg.<br /><br />  Overall, this is the best thing that happened to metal since the 1995 re-masters of the Iron Maiden collection (1998 remasters good, but not all the goodie tracks).  I wouldn't even hesitate to say this is more a important remasters series for metal of this genre, because it give helloween to re-gain the international recognition it should have again.  The Walls Of Jericho are the best place to see the origins of one of Germany's best exports.
B000FFJ85I|3.0|A.F.I. used to be a lot better (I say that for all those new fans who didn't know about them until this album came out) back when they still played as a old school punk-revival band, complete with excellent bass lines and somewhat above-average drumming, but after I listened to this album, disappointment filled my ears. 2000's \\"The Art of Drowning\\" was such an excellent, refreshing album that brought some variety to the worn-out pop-punk scene and I hoped that they would continue to make albums of that level, but the release of 2003's \\"Sing the Sorrow\\" marked a turning point in the direction of the band's music, and it saddened me. I was sorely disappointed when I watched the video for \\"Silver and Cold\\" and saw that they had abandoned their fast, punky sound for a slower, more poppy sound. Worse yet, lead singer Davey Havok's voice sounded even more feminine than ever before, sounding almost cheesy as he reached for those high notes. The album overall wasn't too bad, but replay value was significantly lower. Worse yet, they gave in to the pressures of their label and started playing the overdone mainstream rock style, leading to this piece of mediocre musicianship.<br /><br />Davey's voice has gotten a little lower-pitched since the last album, but it is now less recognizable and is interchangeable with other similar bands. It's somewhat tolerable, but after a couple of songs it starts to get annoying and detracts from the natural beauty of the music and ruining what could be otherwise enjoyable songs. He also thought it would be a good idea to try screaming, but being a devoted metalhead and knowing a thing or two about screaming and growling, the screaming does nothing for me and sounds more like filler than anything to help the song; in all honesty, it sounds like Davey is hurting his voice. Guitarist Jade Puget plays cliched soft lines seen in almost every other band along these lines and strumming American riffs that don't give the album much thickness, which the guitar is supposed to do. The guitars are the most important part of any rock album, and there is little progression or impressive skill to be found in his musicianship. Bassist Hunter Burgan isn't nearly as good as he used to be, giving up his driving bass lines like those displayed in \\"The Art of Drowning\\" for a softer, simpler sound that does fit better with the music, but it's not my cup of tea. And of all the members, the biggest disappointment is the drumming provided by Adam Carson, which is boring, and simplistic. He once played compelling drum riffs and speedy pseudo-blast beats, but now he's just there to give the music a beat and little else.<br /><br />Bottom line: A.F.I. has much more potential than this, but they have proven to all of their fans that they're only interested in playing music that will reach the largest audience instead of sticking with their winning punk-revival formula. You can still listen them if you wish to, but A.F.I. has turned themselves into sell-outs like many others before them. As long as I have their classic works I don't give a damn where they go with their music, but I'll miss being able to buy one of their albums and have it be filled with compelling songs.<br /><br />5/10r is supposed to do.

B000EOTEPO|5.0|Now, I already reviewed the first version of this album, and being that it is in my top 5 favorite albums of all time, I figured I might as well add my review to the re-release. Also,don't mind the amazon review, that is for their first album released many years before this one.<br /><br />Few albums come along in ones life where the music leaves you so speechless. For me, this is one of them. This is not only Immortal's best work in general but one of the greatest Black Metal albums ever to be released. Nothing can top Abbath's brutal riffs and his throat ripping vocals. The atmosphere of Darkthrone is here and the talent of Emperor. However, between all that makes this cd a masterpiece is some true beauty. Such as the main riff in Solarfall and the intro in At the Heart of Winter for a few examples. This is a true masterpiece of winter beauty and winter carnage.<br /><br />1. Withstand the Fall of Time (8:29) The first track begins with a single riff before the rest joins in, while the riff not really memorable will grow on you. The first minute is spent gearing up before the song gets into full speed. About 3 and a half minutes into the song it slows down before getting a second wind about 4:15 into it and doesn't stop until the song quietly dies out. WOnderful opening track. I could not think of a better song to open up this album. 4.5/5<br /><br />2. Solarfall (6:02) Immortal's best song of all time. A short drum roll falls in follwoed by one of my favorite riffs of all time then hell is broken loose upon an unsuspecting listener. The song does not let up for one second and has some of their best drumming as well. The vocals are enough to make you wish to conquer all you face. The vocals are almost dreadfully slow in a good way, almost like you wonder how he isn't tearing all of his vocal chords. The song slows down 2:20 into it with some slow drumming but soon returns with that crushing riff. Best song here. 25/5<br /><br />3. Tragedies Blows At Horizon (8:55) This song is 8 minutes and 55 seconds of pure magic. It really starts up about 40 seconds into it and grabs you with hardened claws and refuses to let up. I love the way the guitar riff kicks in at 4:30 with nothing but a take no prisoners attitude. A real highlight on the album. 5/5<br /><br />4. Where Dark and Light Don't Differ (6:45) The first song I heard on this album and it is a winner. The most thrash influenced track on this album has no mellow intro but just decides to come at you full force. The best drumming on the album appears here. The riff that kicks in at 1 minute is majestic and incredible. An epic track. 10/5<br /><br />5. At the Heart of Winter (8:00) This song honestly makes you feel like you're walking into the front line of a war at the heart of a winter storm. This song runs on talent, emotion and an epic battle cry. The two minute intro can't even prepare you for what is to come. Then the rest of the song kicks in barreling down on you like an avalanche you know you can't escape. With guitar playing that just screams talent. The rest of the song continues the epic trail the first half of the song left us with. 20/5<br /><br />6. Years of Silent Sorrow (7:53) Well, instead of ending this masterpiece on a quiet note. Abbath and crew decide to go out fighting. With one of the fastest songs on the album begins the drums tear through your ears. The guitar is pretty fast in an almost frantic fashion at certain times. \\"Dome in the sky black winds to taste<br /><br />shadowed spirits lead my way...<br /><br />Drifting everly alone years of silent sorrow<br /><br />until I'm home... \\" With those words spoken the final song dies out leaving you only time to pick yourself up and try to comprehend the incredible album you just heard. 5/5<br /><br />In conclusion, if you haven't stopped reading this yet and purchased this album. I recommend you do so right now. Enjoy.izon (8:55) This song is 8 minutes and 55 seconds of pure magic.

1594200823|3.0|While I was enlightened by the detail and fine argumentation of the first three quarters of the book, I had a hard time making it to the end. I found the chapters on American beef and corn fascinating, and that fascination continued until I hit the last section, where Pollan hunts down, gathers, and cooks his final meal of the book.  I found that last section way too precious -- a silly  Woody Allen schtick of the urban guy in the outdoors culiminates with some of the most pretentious writing about food you will ever set eyes on.  <br />       In the end, the book has a real problem with point of view and with tone. Is it an exposé? Reportage? Or an excuse to write about meals better than yours?
B00003CX9S|5.0|There's nothing I can say about this movie that hasn't been said below. Lynch is an original, a genius, and this is sublime. I'm put off by the numerous comments complaining about the lack of chapter stops, though. Lynch has chosen not to put them on any of his films that have been released on DVD, and for a very valid reason, I think - he states that he wants viewers to experience the film in its entirety, as he intended and assembled it, without breaks or interuptions. A fair opinion, it seems. <br /> <br />For those who complain: do you resent the lack of chapter stops when you go to the movie theatre? Or, perhaps, do you just start conversing anyway, even though you can't pause the action?
B00005O3VC|1.0|This isn't funny! If I went around saying \\"Ni\\" thinking I was some kind of great comedian rather than laugh people would point me towards the nearest lunatic asylum! Try some comedy which actually makes sense like the Vicar of Dibley.

0689835604|3.0|Although this was fun while it lasted, I can't help but feel there was a lack of any real challenge in this book. You can see it on the front cover for Pete's sake! Stick to Where's Waldo.
B000FIMG68|5.0|While most networks pile up on Dead Body Of The Week shows Lost plows boldly ahead answering some of your questions,raising others and of course leaving you hanging in the end leaving you drooling in anticipation for the next season.Everyone and their brother has a theory of what's really happening on the island.But do you really want an answer?On Twin Peaks when you found out who killed Laura Palmer it was all downhill from there.When you watch the specials on how magicians do their tricks it takes all the fun out of watching magic acts.So I for one am grateful that this season Lost doesn't reveal all.So what's new this year?There are new characters,new better than ever flashbacks revealing the pasts of the characters(Best episode is an emotional mindbender with Hurley trying to come with grip with reality in a mental hospital)there's a mysterious timer that counts down every hour and you must input numbers before \\"The World Ends\\".In the satisfying finale you finally get to find out what happens when time runs out(see they don't totally leave you in the dark!).There are also some emotional reunions and separations,Lost is the only show that can make a grown man cry(ulp,me) because you care about the characters so much.Featuring the most diverse cast on television(the only show that makes you read subtitles thanks to the Korean couple)a constantly challenging storyline loaded with surprises both wonderful and terrible Lost is the only show on television to capture the pure joy of discovery and for that it belongs in anyone's DVD collection.

B00000420F|5.0|'The Impatient Lover' sung by Cecilia Bartoli is a collection of 18th and 19th century songs in Italian which were written by the predominantly German composers, Beethoven, Mozart, Schubert, and Hayden. Oddly, this is very seriously a better, or at least a more enjoyable collection, to my ear, than the 'If you Love Me' collection of Italian songs written by Italians, including Scarlatti, Caldera, and Vivaldi. And, neither collection of Italian songs is as interesting as Mme. Bartoli's collection of French love songs, 'Chant D'Amore'. All are done on London, but with three different accompaniests. I think the French material is just better than the Italian.
B00000JLWW|3.0|Isn't it amazing how lazy the scriptwriters in so called tinsel town are these days - I had predicted less than an hour into the film that the boat was going to sink. Also, surely I'm not the only person to think the ending would have been better if Leonardo DiCaprio had come back as a zombie. Come on Hollywood, give the public what they want!
B00005JP4W|5.0|Simply awesome. For about six years now I've been trying to find something good about Al Gore losing to George Bush. Couldn't find a thing until now. Someone once said when one door is closed another is opened. If Al Gore was president we wouldn't have this movie, small consolation that it may be. But this movie is that important. It is more of a positive contribution to America & the world than if Bush could be elected 10 times. Gore would not have had the time to devote to this movie if he was president. Had Gore been elected Bush would have only had Texas to befoul & pollute instead of the U.S. & the entire world. We are the biggest creators of green house gases in the world. The information this movie provides is easy to digest with lots of interesting animated graphs & other visuals. Al Gore amusing? Yeah he has loosen up some & is even funny. The environment & saving it is his passion & it shows. He bears the sins of his family: growing tobacco for many years on their farm & the ironic punishment in the form of the death  of his older sister. She died, very young, from the  very product they made money on, of lung cancer. <br />He's out front now & I urge everyone to see this movie. Global warming is not a political problem it is a human survival problem. You'll be informed & entertained

630522885X|5.0|The dvd's in the proper CinemaScope ratio, but is non-anamorphic. With that in mind, the picture quality's great.     The movie's among the most beautiful I've seen. As a painter and former animator, I've seen many and am a tough critic. It seems to me, director Max Ophuls and crew were among the few working in the '50s who really understood how to compose in widescreen; in fact, this was Max's only widescreen movie and yet he was a master at it.     Few people complain that old master paintings have yellowed or been cropped, or that the Van Gogh's have turned green, but if a movie looks like it was made ten years ago, rather than today, people complain. This movie's fifty years old, but it doesn't at all look like it, which is remarkable considering it was shot in Eastmancolor, which unlike Technicolor, an old animator I worked under once told me, is very unstable. (Apparently Technicolor release prints exist.)    The Germans recently put a lot of time and money into honoring the director's intentions by constructing (as close as possible) the original, intended version (longer running time, etc.), but the director's son, Marcel, stopped it from being shown (supposedly because in the restored version some of the characters don't/don't always speak French; note, they were never intended to.) This dvd allows us to experience the next best thing. In the (unavailable) German, the colors are supposedly even better, but the colors in this version/dvd are still stunning. You probably know, but just in case: in non-digital media, colors age and in all likelihood different colors age differently. Fortunately no hacks have gone in on this dvd with automatic software and cranked up the colors incorrectly. I used to be troubled that the picture on this dvd is slightly (and I do mean SLIGHTLY) off center; one side is cropped just a sliver. But recently I learned it's not distributor Fox Lorber's fault. The cropping was done years ago by hacks re-doing the soundtrack. What wouldpeople have the distributor do, chop off a sliver on the opposite side to match? Crank up the already bright, beautiful colors into oversaturated kitsch?     If you want to see \\"Lola Montes,\\" grab this dvd.     Watching \\"Lola Montes\\" is a bit like watching Ingres' \\"Grand Odalisque\\" come to life.
B000FFJ85I|5.0|Ok, first let me say this is an awesome cd. The first thing some people might notice is the use of effects processors on guitar and bass. This might not give you that raw AFI sound that most old school AFI fans have come to know. Second there is more electronica from Jade(which by the way is well done and craftfully arranged) By now you should know that the band has been changing their sound with every new album. Let me start wrapping up by saying this: If you liked Sing the Sorrow you should definitly buy this album for it is the second half of the story.(Notice lyric on 37mm,your sins into me,a recurrence from Sing the Sorrow.) So it comes to this,if you liked Sing the Sorrow and are still a fan of AFI this album is a neccesity for your collection.
B000ETQRCM|3.0|I have mixed emotions about this recording. It's enjoyable to me that the band is going back to the hard-edged approach that brought them recognition, but perhaps time has taken a toll. The recording is mushy and indistinct (the blame for that can most likely be placed at the feet of the engineer), but additionally the playing sounds a bit sloppy and lackluster and Eddie frankly seems to be having a bit of trouble singing to pitch. The guitar tone is horrid, as if a bargain-bin mike was set up in the far corner of a garage with a cheesy amp as a source. Still, though, some of the magic is still there. I have respect for what these guys have done, and I found myself enjoying simply hearing them again.
0307276902|5.0|My friend recommended this book to me, she said this one is really great. When I read the book I found that the whole book is written in very simple sentences, and this made me feel very comfortable to read. And the story is very interesting... I heard some parts of this story is fiction, however still the story's great!!
B000002P72|2.0|I can't believe the touch of B.B. King. I enjoy his playing immensely. I know this album gets buried in accolades. But I don't like it. The quality is poor and, differing from other's opinions, the crowd noise takes away from the music. B.B. said, in so many words, that Live at the Regal was far from his choice as his best recording. Typically, he said he wouldn't argue with success--and left it at that. There are so many good albums by B.B. You can't go wrong for $4.65 for the \\"Ultimate Collection\\". Sure it doesn't have them all--but it has quite a few of his great songs, including a few from Live at the Regal. I would steer clear of this selection. Or I'll send you mine for free!

0385720920|1.0|I picked up the book choke because my significant other is absolutely obsessed with Palahniuk and i've read a couple of his works before. Unfortunately this book was just a major upset. At first I found the book rather interesting, but there were parts where it just dragged on and on and on. The flashbacks lessend the pain, because they were slightly more interesting. But aside from that, the ending of this book was the big upset to me in my opinion. This isn't a very Palahniuk-esque, and i wouldn't recommend reading it , it's the first couple pages that draw you in. And Palahniuk was right, don't keep on reading it, becasue it isn't worth your time...
0316168815|4.0|The way this story is told is very intriguing. - Susie Sammons is dead and narrating from heaven.   <br />The characters are very intriguing. - A strong and silent dad, and mid-life-crisis mom, etc. <br />And so though I'd recommend the book as a good summer read, I was also a bit disappointed by the ending. <br />It was a little strange.  And a let down.
B000FFJ85I|3.0|...if you are expecting AFI to cut back to their roots and pretend as if Sing the Sorrow was never released stay away from this album for the progression only goes deeper.  Looking at it from a music lovers point of view I give this cd 4 stars just because the majority of the tracks on the album have a really good feel to them. On the other hand looking at it from a long-time AFI fan I give this 2 stars (hence the average of 3 stars) because I (and I don't think I stand alone when saying this) just miss the old AFI; the fast, crude, thrashy punk band that I knew for so long.  So in conclusion if you are an AFI fan praying for redemption; I think its time to move on.  Now, if youre just looking for a pretty good alternative punk album I recommend you pick this one up!
B000F3A7LE|5.0|In this March to 1981, harnessing the three disciplines, Robert Fripp drew what can, in one context, be viewed as a blueprint for where he, and his participation in Crimson, were headed in the march toward 1981, which would see Crim emerge as a very different beast. (well, all Crims are different, but the Fripp-Belew-Bruford-Levin quartet was something else altogether). I don't believe you can fully appreciate this effort without listening to the interview from Atlanta that is available as a download on DGM Live. <br />A lot of water had flowed very rapidly under Robert's bridge in the mid-70's and finding himself in NYC at a very creative time, even by NYC standards, Fripp seemed to be at the nerve center through most of it. In a very short sequence he had been involved with both of Gabriel's first two records, The Roches remarkable KEEP ON DOING (espousing, as he did with PG2, his concept of Audio Verite), Talking Heads' FEAR OF MUSIC, sessions with Eno, Bowie and a host of others on the avant-rock/pop scene. All of this seemed to galvanize him as a creative artist. Juices flowing, he brought colleagues in to craft an album unlike anything anyone had imagined doing to that point. This is often hailed as the SGT. PEPPER of the avant-garde, and without putting too precious a point on it, the record is all that and more. <br />What's on offer here is both the aborted efforted in which Tommy Mattola, before unleashing Maraih Carey on the world, was already generating abominations by ripping the vocal tracks Darryl Hall laid down from this record and then forbidding Hall to release his own solo shot as produced by Fripp. A second disc restores Hall's contributions and by comparison, shows just how heroic Pete Hamill was in putting the first effort together in the face of the abominable future shlub of the equally grating Carey. <br />As to the merits of the disc itself, the sonic upgrade is not just phenomenal (you expect that from Fripp) but it's a thing of wonder andit gives you a sense of just how much focus it took to have a singer, a guitarist, a bass player perform in three different time signatures with an ambient frippertronics, found sounds and a whole lot of passion drive the title track. Herein you'll likely here the germination of songs like \\"Matte Kudasai\\". Fripp has labelled \\"Breathless\\" as extraordinarily difficult, yet emminently listenable. It is a kindred spirit to various Larks, Fractures and Vrooms that preceded and would follow this track, and this without Bruford! Jerry Marotta is more than up to the tasks at hand. Fripp's allegiance with Tony Levin was initially forged through PG1, but here Levin is let loose and the seeds for the next arising of the Crimson King are audibly taking root, nourishment and growth through this incendiary recording. <br />Terre Roche, Darryl Hall and Pete Hamill offer an entirely new approach to crafting lyrics to the polyrhythmic galeforce of Fripp's music combined with lyrics from Joanna Walton and Hall himself. Fripp's mother and his mentor, J G Bennett contribute conversation, as does a family in Hell's Kitchen who are arguing with their daughter as Fripp takes NYNYNY to a place even NYers might not imagine. And all ofthe thunder, fury and passion are washed away before the final comments of Bennett and Peter Gabriel's lovely solo take with Frippertronics on \\"Here Comes The Flood.\\" There is a wry comment from Eno to close out the disc. This is an extraordinary effort. <br />But I insist that you should download the interview from DGM Live. An attentive interviewer presents Fripp with a platform to enegage the audience in athoughtful consideration of what is on offer, and manages a few \\"bruning questions\\" of her own that are enlightening in their prodding of the King's Prime Minister. Fripp speaks of what is \\"appropriate\\", especially with regard to \\"Here Comes the Flood.\\" I am reminded of nothing so much as Heidegger's investigations, especially of the greek origin of \\"appropriation.\\" I have no idea if Fripp is aware of the investigations, but he comes as close to Heidgger as anyone I have ever heard speak in taking apart what it is that is the business of Musicking, much as Martin set about on his path to clear the ground for Thinking. Coupled with the reference points to the recordings, this is as profound an inetrview as I have heard Fripp deliver. <br />And the interview concludes with Fripp's extrapolation of Discotronics in 5/8 based on the pulse of the interviewer's heart. Amazing.
B00030590I|5.0|Both seek to return to a state of seplicity.  A line a love along with many more from this emotionally gripping movie.  Also there is character delvolpment, but only for one chrarcter which I like because it makes the story go well by leaving Snow in her short sightedness of the bigger picture leaving her and Broken sword at odds with eachother.  Master Nameless does change significantly, from wanting nothing more than to kill the King and then realizing why he should let go of his revenge.  Broken sword said for years, there has been continous warfare, causing huge sufering to our people.  Only your Majesty has the power to bring peace by uniting our land.  he hoped for sake for the greater good, I would abandon my plan to kill you.  Broken Sword said\\" One persons pain is nothing when compared to the suffering of all.  THe ending is sad, and yet happy, with the death of Broken sword, Flying Snow, and Master nameless leaving Storm and Moon...alone.  This is a poetic movie of many colors with the message of peace for all...  Our Land.
B000AQBA1W|4.0|I really like this album. The songs are so beautiful and bring out my hidden celtic nature. But the most appealing thing about this album are the uilleann pipes - for me the most beautiful instrument of all. They were played by John McSherry from Belfast,Ireland. I did a search on him and found some of the most beautiful, inspiring, awesome music I have ever heard. I strongly recommend getting anything by him. If you are, like me, only discovering Irish traditional music, then this album is a must. Get the Japanese version of the album - it has the extra track 'Return to Fingal' and it is absolutely beautiful.
0440211727|4.0|\\"A Time to Kill\\" is definitely Grisham's best novel.  It's interesting that it was Grusham's first novel, but it was rejected for publication until after some of his other novels were published.  The story deals with a number of issues that all intertwine seamlessly.  Racism, murder, justice, revenge, law and order, etc.  The story will hold you from start to finish.  Most of Grisham's newer novels are simple, predictable stories that bash attorneys.  That is not the case with \\"A Time to Kill\\".  It will grip you, tear you and entertain you all at the same time.
0783225903|5.0|Terry Gilliam has worked a truely an imaginative tragi-comedy. This is a film that will go around your expectations and show you something completely unique (I've avoided at all cost saying something \\"completely different\\"). Enter a world where you have to fill out a form to get a form to fill out...in triplicate. Big government where the left hand doesn't know the right hand exists... <br /> <br />San Lowry is a bureaucrat-drone with a tiny automated apartment, a distant mother who enjoys recreational plastic surgery and a never-ending flow of paper to push around the desk he shares --through a wall--with another bureaucrat. You have to see it to believe it. Sam adds some exitement to his humdrum life by imagining fantastic light-infused scenes starring a winged hero--perhaps human potential, his own evaporating opportunities as he ages, or...perhaps someone he has met. <br /> <br />While going through the efforts to correct a simple mistake which apparently cost a meek family man his life, Sam rubs elbows with a skillful cultural terrorist who delights in sticking it to the system. It doesn't take long for Sam to become mixed up in events he's really not too sure about. Throughout he seems an average guy who can't really figure out whether he's here or there, and through attempting to make right for his bureaucracy, becomes a victim of it. But a least he finds love too! <br /> <br />This is not a simple clean tale with an easy ending, you do have to think. Worth seeing for the lavish imagination scenes alone. Dry humor meets absurdity. Welcome to Sam Lowry's world. <br /> <br />
B000EULJLU|4.0|I won't go on for too long, since so much has already been written.  I'll say that, as usual, and especially since Lateralus, I find Tool's music to be sonically captivating.  Guitar, drive, drumming, bass, vocals...all of it.  What pains me is that Maynard can't come up with better lyrics.  With a few exceptions, his lyrics have been atrocious on all Tool and A Perfect Circle projects.  They're just embarrassing.  Search lyrics for \\"Vicarious,\\" the first single off this album.  They're like something a 7th grader would write.  Lyrics for \\"The Pot\\" and \\"Rosetta Stoned\\" are almost as terrible. <br /> <br />All that said, buy the album purely for its sound.  Most of the tracks are mesmerizing and beautiful, though I could do without \\"Lost Keys\\" and \\"Viginti Tres\\" as well.  The first is stupid and the latter a waste of sonic space. <br /> <br />If Maynard and the boys could put together some decent lyrics and tighten up the next album a bit, they could be on their way to being rock gods for the ages.
B0000028SR|4.0|Let's get something straight right off the bat: there is damn good music on this CD, of the kind you don't hear too much of these days, even from Springsteen himself: honest, joyful, good old-fashioned rock and roll with, at least, two or three should be classics: \\"I Wish I Were Blind,\\" which deserves to be in the pantheon of Springsteen's songbook; \\"A Man's Job,\\" just good, fun rock and roll; and the terrific \\"Roll of the Dice\\" (check out the terrific piano playing, which hearkens back to the \\"Born to Run\\" days). Also, check out the lyrics, which are strong and heartfelt. The 4 star rating is because I basically agree with some reviewers who feel that some combination of \\"Lucky Town,\\" released at the same time in 1992, and this effort, might have yielded a true classic - and without some of the filler songs that mar a masterpiece.  This is true, but that takes nothing away from the several terrific songs on this CD - it's the Springsteen we really miss these days, who has produced two recent duds, with none of the heart and soul of some of these tunes.  This is a no-brainer, really, for Springsteen fans, and anyone looking to hear terrific music.  Just put on \\"Roll of the Dice\\" and I defy you not to feel happy and defiant all at the same time.  Bring back the Boss with more songs like these!
B000FILW86|5.0|Can't vouch for the new Rockford CD as I haven't listened to it as yet. I can vouch for the loyalty of the fans of Cheap Trick, as I have been one probably longer than most. The first time I heard Cheap Trick play was in 1972/73 when they were playing at a bar in Beloit, Wisconsin called Waverly Beach. My friends and I couldn't believe that a band that good had come to play there. I can't for the life of me remember any other band that I heard there. What a treat.
B000BYA5GO|5.0|say what ya will, it is another very fascinatingly different movie - always refreshing - never been one like it (at least recently) - and as with \\"bringing out the dead\\", \\"raising arizona\\", \\"8mm\\" and all the more populars like \\"Moonstruck\\", he does something intriguing and differentin his own special way - i loved it and the soundtrack, altho only score is on CD (? - money issue probably) and a great cast - while i thought wife and brother played weak parts, i liked the uncle best of his whole family - \\"the luckiest guy alive\\", the nice ones always get it - huh!? <br />hey, have a watch - worth a buy, if cage fan and 2nd dvd is great if you want some hollywood-documentary stuff about this topic and US (UN) Hypocrisy - nothing will ever change when it comes to money, control and power!  so have a dark laugh, about the capitalistic, opportunistic and  political hypocrites that play international games for profit, with good ol' Nick!  `nuff said! <br />
B00008NRI8|5.0|Well, Sandra Bullock and Hugh Grant are two of my favorites.  So putting them together was a great idea for me.  I haven't seen many of Sandra Bullock's movies. Actually, the only 2 films I really liked her in were The Net, and Practical Magic, the latter just fair.   But I thought this film was perfect for both of them. The music in the background was pretty good too.  I do hope they make more films together, and Bullock stops making those beauty contest films.  They're terrible.
0380002930|5.0|I spent a month reading Adams' tale of a Rabbit Warren's growth and struggle to survive to my six-year-old.  I was amazed at how into the characters she got--she was reading along with me at several points, and trying to get ahead.  Although this novel deals with the rabbit in a realistic natural setting with all of their natural adversaries (foxes, mankind, other rabbits), she was not disturbed, understanding the book was a story.   <br /> <br />Adams creates an entire rabbit culture, making this tale not just a story, but an involved epic.  I was impressed by Adams treatment of the characters, their unique individual traits, how they solved their problems.  Each of the rabbits has something disctinctive, either a talent or an admireable characteristic which proves its use to the growing warren.    This story builds on the bonds of community and friendship, and shows how intelligence, quick-thinking and effort can triumph over brutality and totalitarianism, and how team work can save the day.  Woven throughout are stories the rabbits share with one another about the exploits of the legendary rabbit-prince El-Ahrairah. <br /> <br />A well-constructed plot, if you enjoy intreague and adventure, this book will not let you down.  Perfect for evening reading with the wee-ones, if you make it a nightly habit.  Oh, and the two bunnies that mow our lawn at night are now nicknamed Hazel and Fiver :)
B00000ILDE|5.0|There are movies and there are movies.  The best movies are those that can transcend time.  It may not necessarily look fresh 20 yrs later, but it stands against the hundreds of other movies that have been made.  It's one where you can go back and watch again and again.  Is this one of those?  Aliens is, but whether you can watch it several times in a week, that's up for debate.<br /><br />Personally, this is my favorite Aliens movie.  It tends to be that way for a lot of people w/ the original Alien either just ahead of #2 or right behind it.  Either way, THIS Aliens was a nice sequel.  It also laid the foundation for many other film makers and movies and in a way, it really created a whole new genre.  Or at least, brought it to light and made it `cool'.<br /><br />The story picks up many years later.  Our heroine, Ellen Ripley, is found by a deep salvage operation and returned to a spacestation near Earth.  A few events unfold and she ends up going back to the planet where she first encountered the \\"xenomorph\\".  But she doesn't go alone.  She is accompanied by Simon Burke (Paul Reiser; did all comedians start in sci-fi or end up there?) and a squad of kick booty Marines.  As can be expected, everything falls apart.  There's lot of dying, shooting, crashes, explosions and screaming.<br /><br />It's a sci-fi, action drama.  I love the idea of a group of soldiers who aren't scared to shoot the `monsters'.  The horror element is still there, but it's not as mystery-ridden as the 1st movie.  And that's ok because what would be the point of the sequel if our squad of Marines were scared to shoot?  Oh, that might be Alien3 and Alien4.<br /><br />This particular movie moves forward the whole sci-fi genre as well as the Aliens universe.  Did James Cameron plan on creating such a monster?  Hard to say but then he did establish the Terminator universe also.  His creations are celebrated by fans all over.<br /><br />This movie IS long.  That is the one strike I have against it.  It's not just a movie you can pop in and chill to.  Star Trek or Star Wars (or even the other 2 Alien movies that came after) are better suited.  I'll admit, I don't know the difference between the theatrical release, tv release, edited and whatever other versions there are.  I DO know that when I originally bought this on VHS all those years ago, the automated machine gun scene was NOT in there.  Nor was there a scene of Ellen remembering her daughter.  The Special Edition, which I am assuming is like the Director's Cut, adds more scenes and helps flesh things out.  However, it doesn't change the story like with The Abyss or, ahem, Lord of the Rings.<br /><br />Aliens is a classic in it's own right.  For the price it is at, it's a great deal for an excellent movie.<br /><br />If you want some fun trivia:<br /><br />Mac Macdonald plays Al Simpson, the Colony Officer.  But in the British tv show, Red Dwarf, he is Capt. Frank Hollister.<br /><br />Jeanette Goldstein plays Vasquez.  Find her in T2 as the foster mother.

B000E8QVWY|4.0|Reese Witherspoon showed she can act, and is more of an actress then in \\"Legally Blond\\". The cool part about this movie was that all of the actors and actresses did the singing themselves. The movie is about Johnny Cash's struggles as a singer. He goes through many difficult times, and he goes from being a nobody to a somebody. The movie is enertaining and a exciting movie to watch. It's interesting seeing all of Johnny's struggles throughout the movie.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|Supernatural is hands down the best new show to come out on television.  With a fresh new take on classic ubarn myths such as Bloody Mary, the Wendigo, and the Hook Man, as well as classic monsters such as ghosts, vampires, and witches, the series provides great entertainment and well written plotlines.  Our two strong lead characters don't hurt either. <br /> <br />The series focuses on two brothers, Sam and Dean Winchester(Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles, respectively), who lost their mother to a mysterious demonic force when they were young.  Ever since then, their father(Jeffrey Dean Morgan) has become determined to destroy the monster, and has been training them to defeat all supernatural threats.  Sam eventually leaves and tries to start a life of his own, but after his girlfriend is killed in the exact same fashion as the mother and the father goes missing, he reunites with Dean to finally destroy the monster for good.  Complicating matters is that they're being hunted by a mysterious girl(Nicki Lynn Aycox) that seems to have a connection to the same demon that's been the source of all their troubles. <br /> <br />As many sci-fi/horror series, it focuses on about 6 or so episodes worth of story while the others are pretty much monster-of-the-week fare, but even these are quite entertaining, providing enough twists and turns throughout each individual story to keep the viewer glued.  Padalecki and Ackles also work extremely well as the two brothers, Ackles in particular as Dean, who can be quite a bit of a smartass, providing a few amusing moments through all the usual terror that's going on. <br /> <br />The WB has recently had it tough with their sci-fi/horror genre.  Charmed has ended, and Smallville has become a pathetic joke with the recent season.  This series is just what the doctor ordered.  Here's to a strong first season and future ones as well.
B000EULJLU|5.0|Simply: If you are looking at this page, then you must be interested in 10,000 Days.  Look no further- go buy it! <br /> <br />I have every Tool album from Undertow-10,000 Days...and this is the most powerful to me.  Not saying the other ones aren't amazing pieces of art as well, but this one has a distinct heaviness factor.   <br /> <br />You'll love it.  It's not an album with separate tracks, it's more like one big song that runs +75 minutes long.
B00005KHJM|5.0|Probably a neo-pagan fantasy, but still explores a society that doesn't live by Christian beliefs.  The film takes place off the coast of Scotland, where for several generations a society of pagans have lived by different rules than ordinary society. A religious policeman is beckoned to come and look for a missing child, which he does, and after that it's like a scavenger hunt, with one clue leading to another until the proud and rigid policeman finds himself exactly where the villagers want him to be.  Trapped.      Like to add that if you buy the current Region 1 edition of the DVD, you will miss some very good scenes and if you have seen it on video, it doesn't even have the Gently Johnny song.  It's been cut to ribbons.  Keep your old video that runs 102 minutes, though some newer videos say 99 minutes.  Wait until the complete DVD is out in Region 1 (if you're in North America)   I think the whole thing is on DVD in Region 2, but that doesn't' help me.
0679422714|5.0|I was first introduced to the life of Mao by Edgar Snow's book 'Red Star Over China'  I was greatly impressed with Mao.  Then came the 1960's with the Cultural Revolution.  I could not believe some of the crazy things initiated by Mao.  This has been perplexing me ever since.  This book is certainly a rude awakening for me.  I can see that Snow's book was one-sided and highly biased.  Here is finally a book written by a Chinese (I mean Chang) who grew up in China, lived through those turbulent times and did a fair amount of research in producing this book. While no one can prove the correctness and authenticities of all instances mentioned in this book, it certainly has been able to explain a lot of things that happened.  Snow was genuine but he spent only a short time in Yenan and interviewed only Mao and Mao's men. Other books such as those by Ross Terill and Jerome Chen were far less detailed and authentic.  I highly recommend this book
B00004WMZW|4.0|This is a great example of crunchy glam, with understated horns & production.  A good place to start for novices.  Snappy guitars and sing-along choruses.  It bears mentioning that the superb background vocals are by none other than Flo & Eddie (Howard Kaylan and Mark Volman - the singers from the sixties band The Turtles, and early '70's Mothers of Invention).  Backing vocals are worth the price of admission.
B000002UEB|4.0|Queensryche will forever be haunted by this album and that's not really fair. The band really reinvented themselves for their next release, Empire, which actually sold more albums. But this album is the one that the rockers liked the most whereas many of the sales for Empire were probably due to the fans of the hit single Silent Lucidity. And since the pop fans would of racked off it's the rockers that the Ryche have to thank for their longevity. And the rockers remember this album.<br /><br />So much has been written about the story of this concept album that it's pointless to go into it here. Suffice to say it's not really an easy listening experience but actually quite a gritty storyline. The band shows it's talents by being able to switch to melodrama to blazing away.<br /><br />What makes this album so special is it's appeal to so many forms of the rocker fan. Prog fans loved that fact that these guys had obvious prog tendencies. The headbangers lapped up some of the more visceral moments. And Euro metal fans liked the intellectual pomp of the bands vision.<br /><br />I would NOT recommend this as the album for the newcomer to explore. Certainly, Empire is perhaps a good starting point, perhaps even Promised Land would be a better place to start for the casual fan of hard rock. That's not really a criticism, just a pragmatic point of fact that with it's dense storyline and some hard hitting lyrics this is perhaps not the album for the Queensryche novice.<br /><br />Ultimately this album does not deserve to be viewed as a millstone around the bands neck, but a highlight of a lengthy body of work. Best tracks are probably the rockers such as Spreading the Disease, Mindcrime and Revolution Calling, the Mindcrime track particularly showcasing the lumbering, awesome base sound this band seemed so good at using.<br /><br />The only tiny gripes would be the pomposity of the release and the fact that first time listeners may be somewhat at a loss at all the ornate shadings on this album and the biting subject matter. But these barely detract from what is a very very good piece of work by a band who were always somewhat removed from the trends going on around them.ornate shadings on this album and the biting subject matter.

B000F6IOC0|3.0|The opener for this film delves into the past and shows the relationship between marcus and victor, and marcus' brother. So there is that dynamic which adds a new senerio to the storyline. Besides that this sequel picks up right where the last one left off. There is more action in this film, more blood, a kate shows more skin, although I have a sneaking suspicion that a body double might have been in place for that scene.  There are a couple of plot inconsistancies and action disappointments, but they are more of things I would have like to seen.  Bottom line good sequel, nice addition to a video library.
B0007MWZEK|5.0|I'm not one to write reviews but this really is a handly little sweeper. Mine was a gift for Mother's Day from one of my four children and it's the best gift I've ever gotten. We have 5 cats, a dog a parrot, all indoors and live in a 74 yr old house. Enuf said!! This Swivel picks up everything but men and money!!! It gets the dust bunnies where they stand; they don't wind up under a bed, behind a door or in another room. I can now sweep the stairs with a load of laundry under one arm and the Swivel in the other hand. It works equally well on wood floors, bathroom tile and rugs. I can run it thru the entire house on one battery charge ...but best of all, I now have time for things other than sweeping up!!
B00005JNJV|5.0|I saw this movie last year on a date--the guy I was dating was a big time DC Comics fan and knew the whole Batman history from years of poring over comic books.  I'll be honest, although I watched a few rerun episodes of Adam West's Batman growing up and saw the first three Batman movies, my expertise on Bruce Wayne's beginnings was nonexistent. I didn't know what to expect from this movie, but as it starred Christian Bale, I was more than willing to give it a go.<br /><br />This movie transcends its genre--an action superhero/comic book movie became so much more. I was completely blown away by \\"Batman Begins.\\"  Christian Bale gave his all to this movie and it shows.  He plays the traumatized billionaire to perfection. He broods, he deliberates, he flusters; in short, he's kinda Hamlet-like (though spared the Oedipal complex).  A lot of people have panned Katie Holmes' performance, but I don't understand why. Her role was understated, as this movie wasn't about Bruce Wayne's romantic quests. Katie Holmes convincingly portrays Rachel as a young woman with great integrity and determination, and Rachel is more of a supportive, peripheral character.<br /><br />I also liked that this movie had some grounding in real science--we were shown the science behind the mirrors, smoke & magic of Gotham City and its heroes and villains.  In the other Batman movies, it's all magic. (Granted the scientific explanations are cutting edge and futuristic, I still appreciated that this movie tries to connect spiffy equipment with almost plausible technology. Morgan Freeman's character does a great job of introducing Bruce Wayne to the government's latest finds.)<br /><br />The follies of the Shadow of Leagues demonstrate to us viewers that justice and revenge are not interchangeable. Bruce still clings to the ideal that justice needs to be tempered with mercy, and his mentor (Liam Neeson) cannot change Bruce's stance on the matter.<br /><br />I can't find one complaint against this movie. I'm not a huge action hero fan, but I loved this movie nonetheless.  Bravo to Christian Bale and the cast and crew of \\"Batman Begins.\\"  This Batman bested the other Batman movies hands down.on hero fan, but I loved this movie nonetheless.

B000AADYYO|5.0|No, I haven't been there since the beginning of Opeth, but I sure do love this CD. This music is beautiful, and I do not use that word lightly. If the term, 'brutal yet beautiful' wasn't as overused as it is these days, I would use it to describe \\"Ghost Reveries\\". It is easily one of my favorites by Opeth, and maybe even my personal favorite of 2005. Although Mikael sings a tad bit more than he has in the past, there is just so much to every song, that it is difficult to even use the term 'song'. I would much rather call each track a 'composition'. \\"Ghost Reveries\\" has the most and best musical transitions that I have ever heard on any album, let alone any metal album. It is very difficult to compare this band to anything else out there, considering that this music has so much to offer. It could be placed in so many genres of rock and metal that it's disgusting ( not really, of course ). Normally, I'd highlight my favorites for you, but the whole CD is so great, that I'm just going to put it plain and simple. You want innovative/brutal/beautiful/everything? This is it. Thank you for your time.
B000089RVX|4.0|Enough already of the backlash. This is truly an album that has marked a movement. While it is valid to point out that Nightwish has more talent in their backside than Evanescence and that Doro Pesch did it better and earlier (I'm talking the Warlock album Triumph and Agony here) it's also unfair to dislike Evanescence for being successful. It is fair play to state the Sharon Den Adel of Within Temptation, Tarja of N/Wish and even Kimberley Goss of Sinergy have better and more expressive voices, it's not fair play to dislike a band just because they happened to shift mega units first.<br /><br />So that's my whine.<br /><br />Ultimately Evanescence has produced something that has opened the door to so many other bands it's just not funny. In a situation similar to that which Nirvana found themselves in they have produced a wave of signings of female fronted metal bands from all over the place, to Finlands Sinergy, Switzerlands Lunatica etc etc etc.<br /><br />The fact that record labels do tend to jump on bandwagons and kill originality is not the fault of Evanescence. What is their fault is this great album.<br /><br />The band belt you over the head with everything but the kitchen sink. The first four songs were all singles and putting your most ripping tracks at the front of the CD shows a sound marketing mind behind this albums compilation.<br /><br />But apart from the hit singles we're familiar with, it's the fact that the rockin' tunes keep on coming that clinches the deal. Haunted and Tourniquet are also stompers in their own right and they do show a band not afraid to use a little atmospherics. This is a band that knows how to slow down a touch in order to accumulate heaviness rather than just burn down the highway at full tilt.<br /><br />The case against ;-<br /><br />simplistic riffing, designed to be played while jumping up and down like someone has shoved a pogo stick up you rear end. The sort of riffs skatecore bands were playing in '86 and only marginally fattened out using modern sound mixing technology.<br /><br />Less intelligence shown than, say Nightwish. And certainly more mainstream than Arch Enemy.<br /><br />The case for :-<br /><br />Immediacy of the payoffs. Sure the riffs are simple but they do the job for the musical audience this was targeted at.<br /><br />This mob opened the eyes of US audiences to the fact that there was a whole movement of European female fronted rock acts - and this wave of bands now has a chance to showcase their wares for the US market.<br /><br />Even Lemmy Kilminster has stated that this album was 'above and beyond' the call of duty. So the old guard should perhaps chill out a bit. Hey, if it's alright with Lemmy.....nly marginally fattened out using modern sound mixing technology. <br /> <br />Less intelligence shown than, say Nightwish. And certainly more mainstream than Arch Enemy. <br /> <br />The case for :- <br />Immediacy of the payoffs. Sure the riffs are simple but they do the job for the musical audience this was targeted at. <br /> <br />This mob opened the eyes of US audiences to the fact that there was a whole movement of European female fronted rock acts - and this wave of bands now has a chance to showcase their wares for the US market. <br /> <br />Even Lemmy Kilminster has stated that this album was 'above and beyond' the call of duty. So the old guard should perhaps chill out a bit. Hey, if it's alright with Lemmy.....  <br /> <br />
B00006AW2L|5.0|I know that the Stones started in 1963 but this is where they really get good.  Aftermath and Between The Buttons are my two favorite album by them.<br /><br />The album starts out with the middle-eastern rocker, Paint It Black, which is a signature Rolling Stones song with its trademark sitar by Brian Jones.  Next comes the poppy Stupid Girl that is light-hearted and fun.  Lady Jane is my favorite Stones song(along with Let's Spend The Night Together).  It is a rare song by the Rolling Stones as it is a slow and heartfelt ballad and those are hard to find in the Rolling Stones catalog; sure there's Angie and Wild Horses but I mean a ballad more along the lines of The Beatles' Yesterday.  Next comes Under My Thumb with its marimba sound that creates a unavoidable groove.  The rest of the songs are good but not amazing  except for Flight 505 and I Am Waiting, which is one of The Rolling Stones most haunting songs to this day. It's songs like these that really does make the Stones \\"The Greatest Rock 'N Roll band ever.\\"  Going Home is a good song but it does drag.  I'll admit that it's grown on me since I first heard it where I hated it.  All in all, good album but I agree with the review who recommended Flowers over this one.  With Flowers, you get Lady Jane, the highlight of the album plus Let's Spend The Night Together, Ruby Tuesday, and much much more.
0679409920|4.0|Published in 1978, this novel comes relatively late in Greene's career, and indeed at the beginning it has a warmly old-fashioned air: the London clubs and country shooting parties of the establishment figures, the pub lunches and middle-class suburban life of the civil servants. Everything seems downplayed; the branch of the secret services where this is set deals merely with routine reports out of Africa, not with the major players in the Cold War. There have been leaks, and the reader gradually becomes aware of who is behind them. But, as the title suggests, Greene's interest is in human factors such as love, gratitude, the ties of family, and the consolation of routine; grand political concerns seem of little account. But political matters intervene wily-nily, leading to an ending that is as bleak as it is inevitable.<br /><br />Earlier in his career, Greene used to separate his thrillers from his more serious novels, calling them \\"entertainments.\\" He had dropped the distinction by this point, but the first half of the book at least falls very much in the \\"entertainment\\" vein, rather as though Greene were an older relative of John Le Carr&eacute;. Later, as the portrayal of the characters at center stage vie for the reader's interest with the many-layers of backstage manipulation, the book gains true novelistic depth. But I was disappointed that Greene did take this as far as in his earlier works. Although his protagonist is tormented by his situation, one never has any doubts that he is doing the right thing; his crisis of conscience is small compared to that of, say, the leading figure in [[ASIN:0143039024 THE QUIET AMERICAN]]. Greene toys briefly with one of his favorite themes, the Catholic view of sin and redemption through confession, but unlike, say, [[ASIN:0099478420 THE HEART OF THE MATTER]] or [[ASIN:0099478471 BRIGHTON ROCK]], where the issue is central, the equivalent episode here is brushed away almost cynically. And his characters are almost too black and white; although there is a suggestion of a nuanced conscience in at least two of them (Sir John Hargreaves and Colonel Daintry), ultimately this is allowed to count for very little in the outcome of the story.<br /><br />I realize that the preceding paragraph has been largely negative. I like Greene immensely for his uncanny ability to evoke atmosphere, especially in social terms. I admire his ability to draw one into the lives, the souls, of his characters. And I greatly respect his moral integrity. It is high praise to be able to write about the book in these terms at all. I would just have preferred the moral issues to have been resolved as a transcendent victory or even as tragedy, rather than as the bleak outcome of some slightly sordid comedy, no matter how realistic that may be.although there is a suggestion of a nuanced conscience in at least two of them (Sir John Hargreaves and Colonel Daintry), ultimately this is allowed to count for very little in the outcome of the story.

B0002S94OS|5.0|This album very well may be the best I've ever heard. Of course, I have said this before, but this time, I'm going to stick to my guns. Ashes of the Wake has everything. Let's begin with how this band came to be. Formerly known as Burn the Priest, Lamb of God consisted of only four members, Abe Spear being the guitarist rather than Mark Morton. Soon thereafter, Morton returned from Chicago to replace Abe as the guitarist. Meanwhile, the band had added another guitarist to the band, brother to drummer, Chris Adler, Will Adler. The aforementioned three, vocalist, Randy Blithe, and bassist, John Campbell, began to rise up from the underground Virginian metal scene and become what they are today, a force to be reckoned with. As far as the CD goes, it is a non-stop, riff-packed, double bass drumming thing of beauty. Randy grumbles and howls flawlessly on every track. The whole CD is a highlight, but here are some of my top favorites :    1. Laid To Rest - The album's first single, however, the video was kind of a disappointment. The beginning of the song is spoken by Randy, normally I wouldn't like that but for this song it really fits it well. What makes the song so great is the strong riff on the verses. The chorus is almost similar to a shout-along rather than a growl, which is another neat plus.  5. Omerta - This song also begins with a spoken portion, but even though it makes you think, I didn't find it necessary. That's just my opinion. Throughout the song, it seems as if Randy's voice has an echo effect on it, which is pretty cool. My favorite part of the song is around the break when only the drums and guitar are audible. All of the sudden, there is a sweet lead in by Chris and a tempo change.  6. Blood Of The Scribe - This song is chock-full of very high-pitched, almost emo-like, yelps. What really makes the song, for me, is the sixtuplet double kicking layed down by Chris on several occasions.  10. Ashes Of The Wake - The title track has no vocals, but ironically is my absolute favorite of the CD. When I first heard the song, I'd swear I listened to it about 10 times. The five guitar solos, done by guest guitarists Chris Poland and Alex Skolnick, are what make this track one of my favorites out there. The transition riffs and solid drumming also make this song sound awesome.    The only flaw I can really find with this album is that the bass is not powerful enough. Although it may be audible, I hope that on Sacrament, Lamb of God's new album, in stores August 22, the bass is more powerful and able to carry the band. Overall, if you're into metal, in fact, even if you're not into metal, you NEED this album, because this is an album that we will be talking about 10 years from now. Thank you for your time.
B0000C7PRY|5.0|insofar as music expresses and conveys human emotions and experience, neal got music. neal got tune. neal got soul. if anyone knows of a better musical representation of the human experience of conversion to christianity (tumoil/conflict -> inspiration/revelation -> peace) than the four tracks on the 2nd cd: In the Middle, The Storm Before the Calm, Oh, to Feel Him, God's Theme, please tell me. beyond these four tracks, there are many other memorable high points on this work. the totality of neal's contribution to christian music in a few short years (testimony / one / ?) is mind-boggling. hard to believe he's not a \\"cradle-christian\\". wow. i'm a fan.
0763627410|5.0|Our 16-month-old son absolutely adores this book! We read it using silly voices for each fish, and he just smiles all the way through. When he wants to read this book, he'll bring it to my husband or me, making kissing noises.

B00005ONMP|3.0|First, the good: Great box design for packaging, great booklet in various languages describing the history of all the performed works, great value for money, excellent representation of the great Mendelssohn's best works.<br /><br />Now, the bad: the problem with compilations like this is that the material tends to have been recorded at different times and places and frequently by different personnel on various recording equipment of varying quality.  What this means is that some tracks within each disc sound much better then others and even whole discs come in varying sound qualities.<br /><br />Fortunately, the best disc, disc one starts out very well with the great first symphony and ends with the composer's best Overtures and the quality of the sound recording is very good.  Then we get to disc 2 and the sound quality can only be described as abysmal.  The difference in the sound is like night and day when compared with the first disc.  The third disc sounds much better but is still not as good as the first disc while the last disc comes somewhere in between the second and third.<br /><br />There's no doubting the quality of the performances though by Claudio Abbado and the LSO and of course the choice of material but too bad about the inconsistency of the sound quality from track to track and from disc to disc.<br /><br />Still, the 3 stars are for the good points listed above and for the great disc 1.
0152048049|5.0|When I finally looked this absolutely marvelous book up on Amazon, I was surprised and dismayed to see the copy being sold was an alternate translation to my two Katherine Woods-translated copies. <br /> <br />Having not read this new version (and not particularly wanting to), my review is based on the Woods version. <br /> <br />When I first read this book, I took it at completely face value and did not much read into it -- it was a interesting story with very empathetic characters. Then again, I was about twelve. <br /> <br />It is several years later and I am still in love with the prince. Having read the book more times than I care to recount, it was only last year that I realized de Saint-Exupery was saying something deeper about love and the world. <br /> <br />Throughout, the book is quite cynical of the \\"grown-ups\\", its target audience being children -- or grown-ups who are still like children, like the narrator. <br /> <br />Though it seems like a short book it should certainly be reread a few times to grasp the beautiful prose and the second meaning hidden behind the prince and his rose and the stars. The ending is beautiful and sad, and might cause tears to those with tenderer hearts. <br /> <br />A fantastic book, ranking with Peter S. Beagle's wonderful \\"The Last Unicorn,\\" in my opinion. <br /> <br />But -- get the Woods translation.
B000EGCITG|4.0|It may not have been as large a hit as her 2001 triumph \\"M!ssundaztood,\\" but P!nk's 2003 LP \\"Try This\\" certified her artistic prowess and left no doubt that she was in a class all her own. She continues this trend of increasing musical quirkiness and thus quality with her aptly-titled comeback effort \\"I'm Not Dead.\\"<br /><br />With lead single \\"Stupid Girls\\" P!nk has affirmed in a downright infectious way what many have felt in frustration for the longest time - this culture cultivates stupid girls, and everything about it is despicable. Also, follow-up single \\"Who Knew?,\\" on which she collaborated with pop tunesmith Max Martin, shines and sparkles in all the right places and is a likely summer hit.<br /><br />However, sharp material abounds in much variety on \\"I'm Not Dead.\\" The title crack crackles and lilts with forthrightness amid its raw arrangements and stream-of-conscious lyrics, while \\"Dear Mr. President,\\" collaboration with the Indigo Girls, may be the most dignified and effective protest of the Bush administration recorded yet.<br /><br />\\"How do you sleep while the rest of us cry?/How do you dream when a mother has no chance to say goodbye?/How do you walk with your head held high?/Can you even look me in the eye?\\"<br /><br />She also includes an excellent slice of pure power pop with \\"Leave Me Alone (I'm Lonely)\\" that fits her personal style while still sounding pointedly mainstream, while brooding over intense subject matter in selections like the passionate \\"Long Way to Happy\\" and \\"Runaway,\\" the latter of which serves as a companion to \\"Conversations With My 13-Year-Old Self.\\" Both realistically articulate the darkness that often accompanies growing up, a skill P!nk has proven deft at.<br /><br />Also included are the illustrious \\"Nobody Knows\\" and \\"The One That Got Away,\\" the latter of which finds her sounding like a much more talented Phoebe Buffay. Last but not least, she displays her signature attitude with \\"`Cuz I Can\\" and \\"U + Ur Hand,\\" the latter in which she forthrightly tells her man that she refuses to be objectified as a sex object.<br /><br />Overall, P!nk has come a long way since the pop/r&b trappings of her debut album six years ago. Not only has her music increased in quality with each successive record, but she has proven herself an excellent role model for young people through her lyrics, individuality and political awareness.

B000002UJQ|5.0|I used to be a massive Radiohead fan, but then drifted away, and now, just after loading OK Computer on my IPod, and listening to in it's entirety for the first time in a long time, it blows my mind just as much as ever.  <br /> <br />For me, I think this whole cd is about loneliness and isolation in the modern technology driven world, and in the future. This is just a small interpretation of the music and themse here. You could probably dig through this album and fuel an entire thesis on what's here. While this thought may turn off some people from this album, just look at it this way, the more challenging it is, the lesser the chance of you getting tired of it. And let me tell you, I've had this cd for four years, and I still come back to it again and again. It's the most haunting listen of the 90s in my opinion. <br /> <br />Musically, OK Computer sounds like nothing else. It's rock mixed with electronica, mixed with ambience and psychedelia, and given a cold, blurry production. Not surprisingly, this cd goes best on a winter's day when it is all white outside and the snow is falling. The best examples would probably be \\"Airbag\\" with the jingle bells in the background, \\"Subteranian Homesick Alien\\" with it's shimmering foggy textures, and my personal favorite \\"The Tourist\\" with it's at once calm, yet epic multi-layered textures. The only song that recalls The Bends here is \\"Electioneering\\", a garage-band song that still manages to be ambient.  <br /> <br />Thom Yorke is in full Springsteen mode here with his dozen stories of everyday people existing in this cold and mechanical future, and their outlook on it. New-found hope for life is expressed by the character who is saved in a car-crash by an airbag in the song \\"Airbag\\". Paranoia in \\"Subterranian Homesick Blues\\" and \\"Karma Police\\", and resolve in \\"The Tourist\\".  <br /> <br />This disc is unlike anything you're likely to hear again for a long long time, and it's possibly the best artistic reflection of what society is spiraling steadily towards in pop culture today. This cd for me is a landmark because it is an unforgivingly honest and effective look at pop-culture and society today. If you're in it just for the music, it is one hell of a ride that you will never get bored of.
B00020X88O|5.0|Everyone here seems to want to chime in their own commentary on the film's content, so I'm only going to bring up the only thing that matters--how does this new transfer measure up?<br /><br />The new anamorphic widescreen transfer alone makes upgrading to this edition a no-brainer. If you are trying to decide weather to get this hopped-up edition (VIP), or the old version, this is the one to get. Who cares about all the junk in the box, I gave mine all away, I just wanted the new version of the movie. As of this writing, the VIP edition is only way to get the anamorphic version.<br /><br />The older, original issue of this film is non-amamorphic and will not be suitable if you have a widescreen or a 4:3 HDTV with 16x9 enhancement (unless you want use the \\"zoom\\" effect).
0439679958|4.0|\\"Matt Freeman knew he was making a mistake.\\" This was the first few words of the book and it was some of the best I have ever heard. This book had a sort of gripping plot with twists and turns that you couldn't imagine. Also it had many surprises and unexpected happenings. Matt Freeman is a fourteen year old boy. Matt's parents had died when he was younger. The night before his parents had got into that horrible car crash he had a dream of it happening. He never did leave the next morning with his parents to that wedding that morning. But now at the age of fourteen without any parents and a foster parent who works day and night Matt gets into trouble with the law. His unusual punishment is living with an old lady in the countryside of England. Many paranormal and unusual situations happen in this odd little town where comes down to Matt's unbelievable power to help save him and the rest of the world. <br />The genre of this book is probably science fiction or action/mystery/adventure. This is the first book of the series The Gatekeepers. This book was very good because one minute you could feel extremely sad and the next moment happy or even scared. More emotions caused by this book are anxiety, surprised and even giddy. Other books I could suggest to read that are like this is the other series by Anthony Horowitz, which is the Alex Rider series. Raven's Gate was an extremely great book with a good ending and you should try it even if it's not your type because I have told people about this book, who don't like this genre at all and they loved it.
1594200823|5.0|I agree with many of the other reviewers here, the book is eye-opening and paradigm transforming. Perhaps it is not as even-handed or skeptical a view as it could have been. I enjoyed the middle section of the book concerning Joel Salatin's Polyface farm like many other readers. I also like the section before that which discussed much of the context and history that led into the organic food movement, starting in the 1940's when man-made petro based fertilizers first came into use through the 60's communal farm movement and finally to the 90's organic food boom to today. The historical information about the scientists who transformed food growing into the food industry was fascinating as well. The scope of the book is incredibly wide, casting not-so-subtle inferences about our war in Iraq. A brisk read.
0312983867|4.0|Evelyn Soder and her daughter Annie are missing. Mabel Markowitz, the neighbor of Stephanie Plum's parents, is Evelyn's grandmother, and she's desperate to find out what happened to her family. As a favor to her parents and Mabel, taking only a slice (or twelve) of coffee cake as payment, Stephanie agrees to do some investigating into Evelyn's whereabouts.  But she's not the only one looking for the missing mother and daughter. Evelyn's ex-husband, Steven, has hired Jeanne Ellen Burrows--a.k.a. \\"the female Ranger\\"--to track down his wife and daughter, and scary Eddie Abruzzi, who owns both the property where Evelyn lives and Steven's bar, is also on the trail.     Then Stephanie finds herself being tailed by a man in a rabbit suit (probably she never should have told Abruzzi she liked bunnies); her car is blown up (again); and her apartment is infested with creepy crawlies (including snakes, tarantulas, and a dead guy on her couch). Deciding she's taken on more than she can handle, she calls in the reinforcements: Ranger, who used to be Special Forces but now does many things (driving Stephanie wild with desire included), and her on-again, off-again boyfriend Joe Morelli.  And don't worry, the rest of the crew is in on the action, too, including ex-ho Lula, who's just bought herself a bright yellow mini-skirt and dyed her hair to match it. There's even a new \\"Kloughn\\" in town (NOT c-l-o-w-n), a correspondence-course lawyer who's set on wooing Steph's sister, Valerie.  And we readers definitely learn one thing in HARD EIGHT:  Don't mess with Mama Plum's little girl!    Other reviewers here are right:  Stephanie's character takes a major hit in HARD EIGHT.  It's not like Stephanie to have to rely on a man to keep her safe, but that's all she does this time out (although I'd probably call on Ranger or Morelli myself--but not necessarily for protection). Although the novel is characteristically funny, this time much of the humor is at Stephanie's expense; it sometimes feels like we're laughing at her rather than with her: \\"Oh, she lost another pair of handcuffs\\" or \\"Ha ha, she's being attacked by geese because she was dumb enough to throw a Cracker Jack at one.\\"  I want gutsy, slightly-ditzy-but-not-dumb Stephanie back!    But I still can't give HARD EIGHT less than four stars. It was roaringly funny, just as we \\"Plummers\\" have come to expect (one scene, in particular, involving a bagel shop, Grandma Mazur, Bill Clinton, and a bunny performing an extremely lewd act made me laugh so hard I nearly cried).  And for all you Ranger fans out there, we (and Stephanie) get to know him a LOT better in HARD EIGHT (hint: the title of this novel may be more appropriate than you think).     Evanovich has no competition when it comes to balancing outrageous characters and outlandish situations with cold, gritty suspense; there's no one else in crime fiction who writes like she can.  I always try to read the Stephanie Plum books after I've just finished reading someting pretty heavy, which makes the characters and the humor even sweeter to return to.  It's so wonderful to come back to the Burg. I never know what I'm going to find--but it's always even funnier than I expect.
B00005ASGG|5.0|The star power is tremendous in this movie, but what really makes this movie standout from other westerns is what ISN'T in the movie.  No great horse chase sceens, most all the action is set in a small town.  Likewise, no striking vistas, just your run of the mill town.  You have a cattleman/farmer battle, but seen neither cattle or a homestead shot to heck.  And there's very little gunplay. <br /> <br />What makes this movie great is EVERYTHING, which means most of the credit probably goes to producer/director John Ford.  James Stewart has the bulk of the screentime, and his character's determination to do the right thing without violence is in good contrast with Wayne's character, who believes that justice with the gun is the only reasonable course in the west. <br /> <br />Lee Marvin's portrayal of Liberty Valance is evil, plain and simple.  He does what he wants, and gets away with it because no one every quite has the evidence to hang him, and everyone (other than Wayne, Stewart and the town drunk/newspaper editor) are afraid to oppose him. <br /> <br />A key to its greatness is the interaction of the characters.  Wayne's character is cut from ruff timber, but he's likable, and care's about doing the right thing.  It contrast nice with Stewart's softer upbringing.  But they'd be great friends if it wasn't for a certain woman.  The sheriff's a coward, and the editor is a drunk, but he'll print what has to be said. <br /> <br />There is great humor, but the everyday type you might really see between people.  The dialog is great, with hardly a word waisted.  The only slight criticism I might have is that Stewart is probably a few years older than the script intended (after all, he just got out of law school, but looks 50).  Wayne's age doesn't play as badly, and could be a reason he would be so accepting of the way things turned out. <br /> <br />The quality of the DVD is good, but it could have been a little less contrasty.  There are very little extras included.<br /> <br />Imagine a movie that possibly is the best character James Stewart portrays in any movie.  Imagine a movie that possibly has the best character John Wayne portrays.  And imagine this being the same movie!

Somehow , certain scenes have been shot differently and some dialog changed , for the televised version. I'm not referring to \\"dubbed\\" lines , either. The production team , obviously accounted for the eventual televised version and shot new scenes accordingly. Moreover,  brilliant directing , brilliant cinematography , superb editing and dedicated performances , make this film an astounding, heart felt and well deserved , winner of 5 Academy Awards , including Best Picture. This is definately a film that I recommend for anyone who appreciates the above mentioned criteria. Lots of action  , evens the emotional keels and will satisfy the action/adventure fan , as well. Mel Gibson portays Scottish Rebel , William Wallace and the film chronicles his violent rebellion against, the unforgiving and blood thristy, rule of England. Great supporting performances from Brian Cox ,Sean Mcginnley , Patrick Mcgoohan ,Brendan Gleeson, Catherine McCormack, James Cosmo , and newcomer David O'Hara as the unforgettable character , Stephen. Originally , the title kept me form this film because it sounded like a film that would be difficult to get into. However, the film quickly grabs your attentionand doesn't let go untilt he end. \\" Braveheart \\" is cetainly a very powerful film and it's worthy of it's many accolades. Although , great to watch , this film contains gratuitous and gory violence and is therefore not recommended for children.
1400079179|4.0|I saw the movie first, which FINALLY inspired me to read the book.  The novel is very gripping and keeps you reading until it ends.  If you're not familiar with this story yet, it's basically two people (the 2 main characters) meet after one of their close relative is murdered inside the museum in the beginning.  Brown has done his history and many facts about much theology is in the book along with many historical aspects.  But he does leave some facts of other religions that DO worship a female instead of a male deity(a main theme througout the WHOLE book).  Plus then there's the major part that's the most controversial which is the most obvious, but I won't mention that here.<br /><br />While this is my review for the book, I must at least compare it some with the movie.  The movie adds a few things, changes some trivial elements around story-wise, and the ending IS slightly different.  Plus, the movie leaves the ending with MUCH more speculation instead of the finality the novel has with a certain subject. (It also reminded me of \\"Catch me if You Can\\"-with Tom Hanks on the other end of the chase!) I will admit to seeing more Christian symbology in the movie that's NOT in the book (but I won't spoil anything concerning that).<br /><br />I really did not expect the book to be such an easy read.  It goes fairly quickly, the book's pacing for revealing certain plot twists is done better than the movie in my opinion, where as one reviewer mentions (a rollercoaster novel where each chapter ends with a cliffhanger, with chapters that are too short), for me shorter chapters are better in some respects. I like Dan Brown's writing style.  How he melds the puzzle elements together is really quite clever.  Early in the book we read the puzzles as the characters find them, later in the book, this isn't always so, which puts a more realistic spin on it near the end.  A very simple mystery that really shouldn't sway any Christian's beliefs who wants to read it for fun.  Good enough to read again to catch any details missed the first time around.  Had my grandmother been alive to read this she would have loved it.  Something for everyone really, romance, mystery, action, and plenty of logical, geographical, and historical puzzles to keep anybody guessing.  Educated or otherwise.Good enough to read again to catch any details missed the first time around.  Had my grandmother been alive to read this she would have loved it.

6304711905|5.0|This is one of the best Westerns ever made.  A couple of reviewers compare it unfavorably to Costner's Earp.  I watched and liked Costner's but have never felt compelled or interested in seeing it a second time.  On the other hand, I have watched this movie 5 or 6 times and thoroughly enjoyed it each time.  Kilmer's Doc Holiday is riveting.  He absolutely steals every scene he is in.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|When I was told of the concept by a buddy I was a tad hesitant to explore Firefly.  However, I eventually got a copy and I knew from the first episode this Sci-fi western was not only different, but so far greater than any other show I have seen on television.  Firefly's most appealing aspect is the character-driven story.  This is no typical shoot-em-up sci fi (though there is enough for everyone).  The writers' emphasis and enthusiasm on character development and interaction was undeniable.  The writers's were able to develop the nine characters (some will argue 10 if they count Saffron) and allow them to have a very distinct personality in only 14 episodes. <br /> <br />This is television at its best.  It deeply, deeply, saddens me that the American majority prefers reality shows over this wondrous tale. <br /> <br />Keep in mind that the mass love of this story grew out of only 14 episodes.  Buy it and help us get back our beloved Firefly.
B0000AUHPG|5.0|Once upon a time in the west is what I call a pure masterpiece of the movies.If you look at the script,cinematography,scenerey,storyline,history,lines and music, it all seems to reach a higher perfection.It is no secret that I simply adore this movie, and I have done since a little girl. It is, I suppose not your typical \\"women\\" movie,but then again I am not your typical woman.I love the vendetta and the sound of death constantly laying in the background of the movie. I love the characters.How theyre lives are chained together,the suspense,the build up,the sense of humour,the drama.At the end this movie reaches it's climax and all I feel like saying is Unity and perfection! If you have not seen it yet, go watch it! I promise you, you won't forget it!
0060887966|4.0|The alchemist is as casual or as profound a read as you want it to be.  The book has a very 'Arabian Nights' tale feel to it.  The story is simple but inspiring.  <br />The cover of the book is exotic and the water colour illustrations in the book are DREAMY and BEAUTIFUL!  <br />The book reminds us and encourages us to follow our dreams.  <br />However, I think that a little bit of the book is lost in translation. The writing is a little unimpressive... but over all a good read especially during those lazy summer afternoons.
0060825219|1.0|This book was horrible. I have read a few of the author's other works and they were good. This attempt was a waste of time. I think the author just took the formula for all of his other books and applied it to this one. <br />The writing is uncreative and straightforward (which can sometimes actually be a good thing). The plot is ludicrous and uninteresting. The characters are boring and difficult to become attached to. Midway through the book I really didn't care what was going to happen to any of them. <br />Another thing about this book that confused me was the narrarator.Is it Paulo Coehlo? I assumed it was, but then when the narrarator kept talking about all the books he has sold and how everyone holds him in such high esteem I thought there was no way anyone would toot their own horn that way. Bizarre. <br />The spirituality and metaphors are uncreative. Again, I'm sure that he just grabbed his tried and tested spirituality formula and plugged in some of the variables (location and names). <br />
B000FBGBPC|5.0|A Major 3DG fan, I'm wary of saying that this album was better than the first, as I have never been a fan of sequals... but after listening to the self-titled album more times than I can count, and comparing it side by side with \\"ONE-X\\", I think that another band has actually broken the \\"Sophomore Curse\\" since Linkin Park released Meteora in 2003. <br /> <br />This album not only speaks to the listener, but even reminded me of the live shows that I moshed to 3 Days Grace at... and brought me to experience a wide range of emotion. <br /> <br />Simply Put, An amazing CD by an Amazing band... a perfect blend of lyrics and rhthym, and not one weak leg to stand on... More than Breaking through my expectations, I will never doubt this band. Even after hearing about their road disputes, I am confident that this band is stronger and will exponentially gain more and more success.... <br />SCORE ONE FOR THE CANADIANS!
B00003CXBK|5.0|I'm not real big on \\"Family\\" movies but every now and then something comes along that everyone likes. I thought it was a bit over the top at the end, which happends in Anime alot, and wanted to give it 4 1/2 stars for that but you can't give half a star and its too good to get only 4 stars. I also like how there was no clearly defined Cliche' 'good guys' and 'bad guys'. Most people should be able to see every side of story on this one, which is pretty rare since most people are stupid.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|SciFi fans look no further. This show is truly awsome! They should have never cancelled it. Check out the movie (Serenity) as well.
B000F5GNX8|5.0|KISS KISS BANG BANG is one heck of a good movie.  Fresh.  Original.  Funny.  Suspenseful.  And well done all around.  Writer/director Shane Black who burst onto the scene with LETHAL WEAPON has created a film that pokes fun at the very genre which made him famous.  Its complex but sensible plot takes lots of twists and turns and holds your interest throughout.  There are some wonderfully creative scenes especially when Harry (our hero) decides to play Russian roulette with a bad guy orderly.  It's totally unexpected.  The casting is superb:  Robert Downey Jr. is marvelous as the reluctant hero who finds himself caught up in a complex web of deception, murder and everything else.  He's also given a very witty narrative that aids rather than hinders the action.  Val Kilmer is at his best as Gay Perry, the \\"gay\\" detective who is also a consultant on Downey's supposed film.  Kilmer's comic timing is wonderfully controlled.  Michelle Monaghan (MISSION IMPOSSIBLE 3) plays the love interest with a nice mix of seductive flirtation and hard boiled no-nonsense.  Corbin Bernsen, who has been in some really bad films in the past few years, redeems himself playing the nasty villain of the piece.  I really enjoyed this movie; it's so much fun and is one of the best I've seen this year.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
B0001MDQ6W|5.0|Bob Dylan doesnt release a lot concert DVDs. So when one comes along, they have to appreciate it for its rarity and value. I watched this DVD several times and it's great to experience another dimension to him that is not found in his quintessential albums. Get this DVD right now even if you are a casual Bob Dylan listener.
B000AYQLX6|5.0|Forget what the critics say concerning his \\"lost weekend\\" period.  The songs on this album are among his best written.  #9 Dream, Steel and Glass, Bless You, When You're Down are among the best songs on this album.  \\"Whatever Gets You through the Night\\" was his number 1 song co-written with Elton John, and as much as I like that song, it isn't even close to being the best on the album.    While I think that his first solo (Plastic Ono Band) was his best, this is my second favorite.      Buy it, you'll like it.
B00023B1A8|5.0|I saw these guys in Melbourne Australia about 15 years ago. Seeing this performance left me once again mesmerised and emotionally moved. I mean - WOW !!!! (with a mega-capital \\"W\\"). <br />No words are capable of describing this performance. I'm very lucky to have a home theatre system comprising of a 5.1 NAD receiver, 2 front & 2 back B&W speakers, 1 B&W center, 1 Wharfedale 10\\" sub. I was back again in the front seat watching my very own private CSN concert!!! <br />If you don't have this concert, don't just sit there - rush out and buy it!!!!
B000FBGBPC|5.0|No need to give a track by track review. Plain and simple, if you enjoyed Three Days Grace debut album from 2003, then you will enjoy this one.  It is more of there awesome, powerful, crunching, driving alternative rock.   <br /> <br />From the opening first track, \\"It's All Over,\\" which is very much similar to the way they opened up there debut album with the headbanging thrashing \\"Burn,\\" to the very last track, \\"One X,\\" which is an awesome inspiring song that talks about us being in control of ourselves and even though failing at stuff and getting knocked down, we will get back up and continue.  Just an awesome way to close out the album.   <br /> <br />So all in all, I highly recommend this to everyone who enjoyed Three Days Grace debut album from 2003, and also everyone who enjoys some good ol hard driving alt rock tunes!!
B00003CXRM|5.0|I think its a amazing movie, well directed, great acting. I love the humor in it. I guess only some people I met so far liked it. You just have to be different. If you are typical low intelligence american who likes action movies or lame romantic movies you might not like it.
B00006LJ6X|4.0|Chicago VII is the first album to present songs written by every one of the members.  Each member stretches a little, too, sometimes bringing in his own session musicians, hence my tag of \\"White Album\\".  It is because you see the individuality of every member, and not so much the pure full ensemble found in the first six albums, that this album is so well-liked and fresh.  It is still Chicago, but there are some differences and trends.<br /><br />First - Peter Cetera is the primary lead singer for the first time.  Three of them are ballads that did well in the charts.  One is a ballad without any horns, foreshadowing his solo career.<br /><br />Second - Chicago is clearly well into their latin period now.  Laudir de Oliveira is a real presence on this album, while not being listed as a member yet.  Their raw rock sound of CTA - VI is diminished, but the latin era is here, and a lot of people love it.<br /><br />Third - Lee Loughnane's raspy  first lead vocal and his voice added prominently to the backgrounds on several tracks is a sort of look ahead to the vocal sounds of the Champlin era.<br /><br />Fourth - The only song to feature only The Original Seven on it is \\"Women Don't Want To Love Me\\" - the weakest track on the entire album.<br /><br />Fifth - Robert Lamm is beginning to hand over the creative reigns.  His time is split between this album and his first solo album - for which several very good songs that could have been pitched to Chicago are recorded.  He is not the creative monster he had been in prior albums.<br /><br />This was the first Chicago album I bought after becoming a fan in 1973.  I anticipated it for months.  I bought it the first day it appeared in the stores, and when I played it I remember that a number of things disappointed me - I didn't like the congas, the strings, the extra singers and instrumentalists.  There weren't enough horns and extended solos.  I listened to the entire album, hoping with each track that one of the songs would be like Make Me Smile, or Now That You're Gone.  It never happened.<br /><br />As I have grown older, I have come to love it.  It is Chicago's only true epic album, not just because it was a double, but because it sprawls all over the musical landscape.  To me - they are no longer a \\"Chicago\\" band, but more of a west coast band with this album.  Their skill at making records shows.  It is indeed their last experimental album.  After this, you will hear a lot more fun and maturity in their product.<br /><br />32 years later - I listen to it now and appreciate it more than ever.  I even like \\"Women Don't Want To Love Me\\".  It is the last track on any album to have only The Original Seven.  Listen to the relentless instrumental breaks.  Yeah, this song makes it.  It is a fitting farewell to the groundbreaking style that burst upon the scene in 1970.<br /><br />But an epic is not necessarily a five-star.  That is reserved only for Chicago's very best albums.  This is an excellent album, but not one of the best.  I recommend it for every music fan, not just fans of Chicago.e songs would be like Make Me Smile, or Now That You're Gone.

B00005JO20|2.0|I fell asleep ten minutes into this film.  I thought Jack Black was miscasted.  LOTR is awesome but King Kong was slow paced and boring.  The best part of the film was when they fight the giant insects.  The insect part was great.
0441172717|5.0|One of the best books I have ever read. I mean this is prime stuff, one of the best science fiction books written. I think there is a lot of excess plot description but the dialogue made you get into the book, almost feeling like inside of the book. I recomend this to age 16+ because of how hard it was to read. A must read if you like science fiction
B000ESSTL0|1.0|This CD was listed as a CD/SACD + DVD on the depechemode.com website. The CD layer on the SACD was also DSD remastered and was an improvement over the regular CD release. <br /> <br />I think they should be presenting a CD/SACD + DVD (as originally designed) on this 'remaster' series, not just a plain CD with an additional DVD. Get the imported version with SACD.
1400079179|5.0|Best book written (that I have read). Makes me want to see the movie and hope that a sequel comes out either on book or movie. Long book and took forever to read it, couldn't put it down. The dialogue makes you like it, and some of the descriptions. I think they could have easiled shortened the book but it is after all a very long story. The characters, are unexplainably awesome. They change so much (mature) and is a must read novel.
B000DZIGDU|4.0|Using the deserts of the Southwest and California and under the direction of Sam Mendes, we get an unabashed depiction of U.S. Marine involvement in Iraq.  Through the eyes of marine (\\"jarhead\\") Anthony Swofford played by Jake Gyllenhaal, we get the full view of his experiences commencing in the harsh brutal environment of basic training.<br /><br />Gyllenhaal trains as a scout sniper under the tough love of his platoon leader SSgt. Sykes played nicely by Jamie Foxx.  They eventually ship out to the deserts of Saudi Arabia soon after the seizure of Kuwait by Iraq.  Each man must deal with the stress and anxiety of possible chemical and biologic warfare and months of boring inactivity in the sweltering desert heat.  As time rolls on Gyllenhaal, whose family life is a disaster becomes obsessed about the fidelity of his girlfriend from back home.  This puts more focus on murkiness behind the objectives of the Marine presence there.<br /><br />Director Mendes does a meritorious job of creating the hellhole of a setting that Desert Shield was including oil spewing burning wells and incinerated corpses decaying under the desert sun.  He aptly points out that this experience can't help but shape the future of all those who served in that conflict.
B000EMGAOY|2.0|ok, i love the chili peppers. Blood Sugar Sex Magic and Californiacation are two of the greatest albums ever recorded so i am a big fan but i have been alittle disappointed in their direction. By the way was a horrible cd and too radio friendly. So when i heard this album was coming out and i heard it was more of their old sound i was very excited and it was a double cd....two helpings of RHCP, AWESOME! <br /> <br />But you know what? this album sucks too, very bland sounding, very boring sounding and too poppy sounding. The chili peppers are a great band but they are going downhill fast. They wanna be liked by everyone and they wanna be played on the radio. <br /> <br />listen to it before you buy it....i persoinally cant see how people are giving this album 4-5 stars. theres a few good songs on this album but 95% of it is boring.
B000F6IOC0|5.0|I get so sick and tired of people putting this franchise down. I mean, if you are an action/horror fan, especially a fan of vampires and werewolves, what more do you want? If you want a movie with a superb plot thats real and great writing, then go watch something else. That's not what this kind of movie is for. It's great action, great special effects, some blood and gore, and most of all, it's just a fun movie. I wish people would quit over analyzing movies like Underworld, and enjoy it for what it is. And no other movie comes close to matching Underworld's intensity and style. It's simple. You like action? You like horror? You want to see some cool special effects? Buy this movie. You want to watch an intelligent movie with superb writing? Buy something else.
1416524800|3.0|One really bad character really hurt this book - the villainous senator's campaign manager. She's supposedly brilliant but she's a complete idiot - she knows NOTHING about politics, people, campaign financing, the DC environment, etc. The other characters are not well-developed (i.e., do they seem like they might be real people?), but the heroes have some plausibility, the senator is a simple cartoon character (but it doesn't matter because he's just a dramatic foil), and the characters alctually have a little texture.<br /><br />The story is entertaining and provokes thought occasionally. There's a certain Mission Impossible action feel - enivision 3 tethered good guys being pulled accross the ice by a spinaker in an 80 knot wind while the bad guys chase on motorized skis!<br /><br />I guess I was disappointed because I thought Code was better crafted. I wasn't sorry I spent my time reading the book but I wasn't glad I had read it, either.
B000AMJDHY|5.0|This is the most awesome CD ever! What started out as my liking one song...ended up in my liking 90% of the CD! Except for the intermissions and two songs the CD is awesome. It's really some music you can listen to and get down and boogy. An extra kick is given with the burlesque theme and the 20's jazz kinda thing along with Urie's highly impressive voice. If  you're looking for a fun-dance-good time- CD, this is definitely it! I highly recommend this bangin' CD.    Intro- well it's an intro something not really needed in my opinion.    The Only Difference Between Martyrdom And Suicide Is Press Coverage- 10/10 - This song is awesome! The lyrics are really cool and smooth in with the nice fast paced beat. You'll find yourself tappin' and a snappin'    London Beckoned Songs About Money Written By Machines - 10/10 - Another one of the best songs from this album...something I can really relate to. It really makes you wanna bang your body against somethin' lol    London Beckoned Songs About Money Written By Machines - 6/10 - This is one of my least favorite songs...if you'd like to hear this song i'd recommend hearing the Demo version one first which, in my opinion, is much better.    Camisado - 5/10 - Again not one of Panic's best songs. This song is nice i guess if you're looking for one of those sit and listen types of songs.    Time to Dance - 10/10 - This is when the album restarts its good beats. As soon as this song starts, you'll know that you're in for a head bangin' song. \\"Shotgun, Wedding! Shotgun, Wedding!\\"    Lying is the Most Fun a Girl Can Have Without Taking Her Clothes Off- 10/10 - This song is awesome and full of interesting words and a kinky kind of meaningness. This song will just make you run outside and thank God for all the beautiful people!     Intermission - yet again an interrupter to a great CD which again was not needed    But It's Better if You Do - 10/10 - This song continues the greatness and fun of the CD. You'll like the message that issent through this song, if you are into someone that you don't have contact with. Again one song that'll make you wanna stand and dance. You'll find yourself clapping along with Brendon Urie, the lead singer, towards the beginning of the song. One of the best songs in the album!    I Write Sins, Not Tragedies - 10/10 - One of the most known Panic! songs. This song is cool and fun to sing and dance along to.     I Constantly Thank God For Esteban - 8/10 - This song is really a drop considering it's previous order of good tracks. It's a likeable song with a catchy chorus though and fun to listen to.    There's A Good Reason These Tables Are Numbered Honey, You Just Haven't Thought Of It Yet - 10/10 - You'd have to be crazy not to like this song! One if not the best on the album, this song will make you wanna dance and stand up to those evil bullies.     Build God, then We'll Talk - 10/10 - Also filled with really catchy lyrics. Along with a few other songs, this track shares some interesting words you will have to look up. A kind of creepy song but nothing to worry about. You'll probably have gone through one of the songs at least twice before you get to this song.
B000F9UE4I|2.0|I was very dissapointed by this album. After the mediocre \\"Evil Heat\\" I was glad to hear that the Scream had made a total change in direction with their new album. But this album turned out to be even less inspiring than \\"Evil Heat\\". Some people have compared this one to \\"Give out but don't...\\" but I think it sounds more like \\"Evil Heat\\" without the electronics and drum-machines. <br /> <br />There were no surprises or great musical moments on this album, just ordinary straight-foreward rock. Sure, songs like \\"country girl\\" and \\"99th floor\\" were pretty catchy, but nothing special. Not what you'd have expected after a four year long wait. This music could have as easily been composed by \\"the Hives\\" or some other \\"alternative\\" rock band. <br /> <br />Also the lyrics and vocals were sometimes very cliche. A couple of instrumental jams would not have hurt this album.
0440224764|3.0|I normally enjoy Grisham books but I found this one to be dull with a conclusion that was both rushed and expected.<br /><br />I don't suggest it unless you are REALLY into legal jargon and don't mind an ending that could only have been done in such a way because he anticipated writing a second book about this character.
0224076051|4.0|I haven't read the book (yet), but I have followed Peter Woit's blog for the better part of a year on a regular basis, so I have a pretty good idea about what the book covers.  I have also, from time to time, attempted to read Lubos Motl's blog as well.  Lubos has also reviewed Peter's book here--in highly negative terms.  All I can say is don't take Lubos's seriously without checking Lubos's blog yourself; as smart as he might be, he occupies a unique, alternate universe with regard to the conventions of civilized discourse.   <br /> <br />The math involved is far too abstuse for me to form a judgement on the core issues of string theory itself.  Instead, I wish to make a point about Peter's philosophical stance: he's far too quick to wish that theoretical physics would continue to make testable predictions.  In the golden years (by which I refer to the years leading up to the formation of the standard model) that was indeed how physics worked.  It's no longer clear to me that physics *can* return to that idealized modus operandi.  I never felt reading Peter's blog that he pondered that possibility deeply enough.   <br /> <br />There's a major distinction to be drawn here between a theory that can't be tested in principle, and a theory we simply can't *afford* to test, considering the cost of the equipment required (a supercollider the size of the solar system would be a good start in stocking any modern experimental physics lab).   <br /> <br />What Peter points out abundantly well is that the nature of the game has changed: the experimental checks and balances that existed a generation ago are presently in a state of shambles.  Part of the problem here lies with the standard model itself: it is simply too good already.  We are mostly seeking to augment the standard model on theoretical grounds, not practical grounds.  If the standard model were failing on practical grounds, there would be no shortage of testable remedies proposed.   <br /> <br />The elephant in the room, as far as I'm concerned, is the question of just how much is there left to predict that can be measured/tested by machines we can reasonably afford to build/operate.  The string theorists would like us to believe that we fund their activities because they are on the scent of another set of discoveries as momentus as the standard model itself.  This is quite simply not going to transpire.  Even in the best case scenario where a predictive theory emerges, the vast majority of what it predicts will remain outside of experimental reach; the best we can hope for is a few tantalising glimmers of experimental corroboration, whereas the standard model was far more broadly corroborated during its formative years than we can ever hope to replicate concerning its ultimate successor.     <br /> <br />The philosophical question this raises is this: why does society continue to support the theoretical physics enterprise when it has long become clear that future successes--whatever form they might take--will not resemble any template of past success?  Much of the core of Peter's book is that the general public as yet fails to understand that this is the proposition we face.   <br /> <br />Unlike Peter, I'm prepared to accept that wrangling string theory into a testable configuration is not a twenty-year task; it could well be a one-hundred year task.  It is my belief that the future of physics will increasingly consist of long hopeless voyages into the theoretical weeds; the physical world no longer speaks to us in the price range we can afford to stump up.  I have no problem with society continuing to support speculative theory.  I accept that very few or no testable propositions might emerge over many generations of work.  Experimental validation was a tremendous luxury while it lasted.  The next forty orders of magnitude in the energy scale won't give up their secrets half so readily as we fondly recall.   <br /> <br />The difficulty this brings about--and here I am entirely with Peter again--is that past standards for deciding which working physicists were making positive contributions and which physicists are publishing rubish have gone far by the board.  We now have this giant abstruse literature which contains large amounts of pure rublish (of that I harbour no doubt whatsoever), yet there is presently no viable frame of reference for determining which 50% (or 90%, or 99%) is the rubish, and what remaining fragment is worth keeping.  The string theorists cite each other, no outside party understands anything, it has all become highly cabalistic.  Lubos, in particular, loves to point out how the outside parties lack the IQ points to appreciate this beautiful theory.  That might well be the case, but it is *not* the case in the animal kingdom that the low-IQ outsiders continue to indefinitely foot the bill because the high-IQ insiders ooh and aah ever so persuasively; Lubos should be careful what he wishes for.   <br /> <br />If string theory is to become an intellectual venture of many hundred years, and it might take that long to get anywhere, why are we pouring so much money and talent into it now, in this generation?  There are other areas of physics that might have more immediate promise.  With every new discovery in string theory, it only seems that the weeds become that much taller and thicker.  How many people are left who believe that string theory is primed to burst out into the sunlight with an experimental prediction any day now?  Not many, that I can see.   <br /> <br />Like Peter, the landscape is what really gets my goat.  To my ear the landscape is quasi-religous speculation.  I'm not opposed to people speculating about the landscape, nor am I opposed to departments of religious studies.  I am, however, strongly opposed to the use of funds earmarked for physics being put to this purpose; such work belongs in a department explicitly organised to recognize and promote expertise in quasi-religious speculation.  Physics has no such tradition, and I sincerely hope it never does.   <br /> <br />Peter is great in promoting the case that string theorists have deviated far from the historical norms of physics as a discipline.  He isn't so good at confronting the philosophical question of whether historical physics (the semi-lockstep march of theory and experiment that we so fondly recall) continues to exist in any practical sense.  If it doesn't, string theory might be the best we can do.  However--if that is the case--there's a lot to be said for the general public (who ultimately foot the bill) understanding that this sea change has indeed taken place, and in that cause I regard Peter's contributions to the public debate as an excellent first step.
B000BVQ9JO|4.0|I've been a strokes fan for a while and I can say safley that this record is solid.  The reason people have harsh critiques about it is that it is diffrent and that it has some so-so tracks.  <br />   The first five tracks set up the album to be an epic album for The Strokes, however, in the midst of the tracks between \\"on the other side\\" and \\"redlight\\" the strokes are burdened with a dull sound that fades into the moaning voice of julian and twangy backround guitars.   <br />   It would be wrong, however, to say that all those tracks are terrible.   <br />Electricityscape will grow on you <br />Fear of sleep is a great track <br />  The rest of the tracks all seem to blend together and come off as a medocre bore unless you give them a hard listen, which shouldn't be necessary. <br />   If the CD had been 9 of their best songs with a little tweaking, I would not hesitate to give it five stars. <br />   It is a good album, and the strokes are only getting started.  To those who say the Strokes are done, this album is trash, etc.  All I can say is: no.  The Strokes are diffrent now, and you don't like them, whatever.  Real Strokes fans wont care so go find a new band. <br /> <br />
6305263248|3.0|*WARNING* Review full of SPOILERS<br /><br />A masterless samurai? I suppose if Samurai had a complete and utter disregard for human life, maybe the premise of the move works. Maybe Ronin roamed the countryside randomly attacking their enemies and killing any number of innocent civilians who were just in the way. If they did, then De Niro as a modern Ronin is quite believable.<br /><br />De Niro is a talented actor, and Jean Reno does a great job as his partner in crime. The supporting cast all play their roles excellently. If I was judging the movie on acting alone, it would get five stars.<br /><br />The plot of the movie frustrated me. In the real world, there are no such people as these characters. If a group of such competent criminals existed in the world, they would rule us all. De Niro's incredible driving skill, shooting skill and ability to calmly direct crude surgery on his own body without the benefit of local anesthetic were all a little over the top.<br /><br />Here's the thing - you can't just run around Europe getting into random gun battles and killing multiple people the way the crew in Ronin does. The amount of random violence between pursuer and pursuee is overwhelming and we see at least a dozen or more helpless civilians shot down during the multiple gun battles.<br /><br />These are the sort of wanton scenes of violence we've all seen 1,000 times.<br /><br />What's good: De Niro is always asking questions, looking at angles, and preparing an escape route. Very believeable and I liked that aspect of his character. I also liked the friendship that developed between Reno and De Niro's characters.<br /><br />What's bad: The car chases are unbelievable. In real life, they would end with death.

B000FBGBPC|4.0|On Three Days Grace's latest release \\"One-X\\", the alt-metal Canadian quartet doesn't succeed by taking their music to new heights; they succeed by refining the sound that works for them.  Though the slicing guitars are there along with the growling bass and drums, Three Days Grace does show some diversity as they tear through 12 songs whose themes focus on personal struggles, ill-fated relationships, and rallying cries to those who might not otherwise think life is worth living.  The disc starts out strong enough before it stutters for a couple of tracks in the middle.  You get the feeling that the two weakest tracks \\"Let It Die\\" and \\"Over and Over\\" are spawns of some of 3DG's top 40 radio success.  They're tracks that are pop-metal readymade for appeal to a broader audience.  For the most part though, the band sticks to its roots, and finishes the album with 3 of its strongest tracks.   <br />      <br />On the album \\"One-X\\", Three Days Grace front man Adam Gontier still has dark places to explore in his lyrics and he does so with grit and pain in his voice.  Adam's obviously been disillusioned by a broken relationship as is apparent on tracks \\"Let It Die\\", \\"Over and Over\\", and \\"Gone Forever\\".  You get the impression that maybe that broken relationship causes him to evaluate himself as he dabbles in self-disgust on \\"Animal I Have Become\\" and \\"Time of Dying\\", but as he expresses himself in \\"Pain\\" he concludes, \\"I'd rather feel pain than nothing at all.\\"  Lest you think Gontier as a hopeless individual, he shines a bright side of unity for others on \\"Riot\\" and \\"Never Too Late\\".  He ties it all together for the title track \\"One-X\\" as he preaches \\"We are the ones/ we stand above the crowd\\".  Indeed, Three Days Grace does on their latest 4-star release.   <br /> <br />Song-by-song Breakdown: <br /> <br /> 1.  It's All Over [4.5/5] - A great opening track with a rarity from 3DG: a soaring guitar solo <br /> <br /> 2.  Pain [4.5/5] - Strong song with an infectious chug-chug, swaying chorus  <br /> <br /> 3.  Animal I Have Become [4.5/5] - The radio hit still sounds fresh with its thumping bassline and choppy guitar <br /> <br /> 4.  Never Too Late [3/5] - Mid-tempo track laden with acoustic guitar and a chorus laced with hopeful words from lead singer Adam Gontier.  Nothing too new here; sounds like any alt band could have written this one. <br /> <br /> 5.  On My Own [5/5] - As the title suggests Adam has been left on his own by his once girlfriend.  That means you're in for a sampling of his heartfelt, angst-propelled vocals that sneer of his dissatisfaction.   <br /> <br /> 6.  Riot [4/5] - A guitar riff reminiscent of 80's metal fuels this obligatory anthem for the moshers at live shows.  The song's chorus line, \\"Let's start a riot, start a riot,\\" says it all. <br /> <br /> 7.  Get Out Alive [5/5] - A more melodic tune that builds itself around anxious lyrics. <br /> <br /> 8.  Let It Die [2.5/5] - The weakest track on the album leads you to think you're listening to Eve 6 for a minute.  This is a place where 3DG needs to tread carefully, or not at all. <br /> <br /> 9.  Over and Over [3/5] - Spurts of a string section throughout this song.  This is the point on the album where 3DG begins experimenting with their sound a little, without any great results at first. <br /> <br />10.  Time of Dying [5/5] - One of the heavier tracks on the album that sounds as if it could have fit in perfectly on their first album. <br /> <br />11.  Gone Forever [5/5] - Sounds like it could almost be a sequel to \\"Wake Up\\" from the first album.  Judging by the lyrics, you get a sense that Adam is still hitting the bottle to ease the pains of love lost with a drunken stupor.  But with writing like this, we definitely don't mind. <br /> <br />12.  One-X [5/5] - The title track is the perfect closer for this album as it unites all the messages of \\"One-X\\".  Expresses a feeling of hope atop some experimental introduction and verse parts.  A decent guitar solo in the middle of the song as well.  Ends with a sing-a-long chant of, \\"We stand above the crowd!\\"
B000EPR7NE|4.0|Being a huge fan of movie sound tracks I often buy titles just on the name of the artist.  Hans Zimmer is one composer that I will almost alway pick up no matter what the movie is (he's no John Williams or Jerry Goldsmith, but then again who is?).  The Da Vinci Code is not his usual action epic and he composes with a less militaristic and less rapid pace than usual, and it pays off well.  It is a movie score where one can enjoy 90% of the tracks whether or not they've seen the movie.  Track 13 is the best of the score and well worth the price of the CD.  Not Zimmer's best, but a hell of a good listen and well worth the price. Highly recommended to lovers of movie scores and/or classical orchestral music.
B000002BE9|3.0|Fiona Apple debut album Tidal is a great collection of poetry-driven lyrics and excellent song arrangments. Standout tracks include: Never is a Promise, Sullen Girl, Shadowboxer, Sleep to Dream, and Criminal. The rest of the tracks are too sleepy or strange for me. The song I can't get enough is Sullen Girl, Fiona was raped by a stranger when she only 12 and this song is about that horrible experience, \\"But he washed me ashore and he took my pearl and left an empty shell of me and there's too much going on but it's calm under the waves in the blue of my oblivion.\\" Shadowboxer is the best song on the record, her voice is gorgeous and full on this haunting song, \\"So I'll be sure to stay wary of you love, to save the pain of once my flame and tiwce my burn...\\" She sure can write! also check-out her sophomore effort, When the Pawn...
B000F39MAQ|3.0|This production is inadequate in almost every respect, except vocally. The stage design and dramatic direction is incoherent and unconvincing. An almost bare set, modern dress and a few masks is not enough to re-create the dramatic world of Traviata. The large clock which dominates the right side of the stage is a continual reminder of the intrusiveness and inappropriateness of the stage direction. Someone who did not know the story of Traviata (if such a person exists!) would not be able to deduce it from this production. <br /> <br />Musically, while the Vienna Philharmonic play beautifully and precisely as always, the musical direction by Carlo Rizzi is equally unconvincing, lacking tension and dynamic contrasts. Compare the same orchestra under the late, great Carlos Kleiber in his DG recording, to hear how the opera should be conducted, with precision, tension and dramatic momentum. <br /> <br />However, ultimately this production is saved by its singers. Rolando Villazon is a splendid Alfredo, and Thomas Hampson, as always, brings distinction and dramatic intelligence to the role of Giorgio. Anna Netrebko demonstrates that she is more than just a stunning young woman (which of course she is). She sings with power and a purity of tone, and throws off the coloratura arias with absolute confidence. The only reservation is that she looks and sounds just too healthy to be taken for a consumptive  courtesan, and bounces around the stage like a hyper-active teenager. (There is a lot of overacting from all the principals - if you can imagine overacting in opera! - which can also be attributed to the director.) Vocally, while extremely impressive, Netrebko does not offer too many dynamic contrasts. You would imagine from listening to her that most of Violetta's arias are marked \\"forte\\", and while she dazzles with her technique and power, she does not convince emotionally when the score calls for pathos and vulnerability. I sometimes felt I was watching Brunnhilde or Elektra rather than Violetta. And yet I continued to watch, despite these criticisms, mainly due to Netrebko's physical and vocal presence.  <br /> <br />This is a production which can be recommended only with serious reservations. It does not replace the Gheorghiu/Solti DVD, which is virtually unsurpassable, with Gheorgiu displaying all the vocal strengths of Netrebko, but adding more character and vulnerability to the role and, in my opinion, having a more distinctive and attractive voice. The production is also close to ideal and Solti's conducting is excellent. The Zeffirelli film version with Domingo and Stratas would be the second choice on DVD. This new version can only be recommended as a supplement to the two mentioned above, as a record of a young Netrebko's impressively robust portrayal of the consumptive Violetta.
B00005QK3W|5.0|For the average person Driving Rain is just another <br />album cover. For those of us who know that Paul  <br />McCartney is dead, this is another Beatle album cover <br />that is chocked full of clues by Paul himself meant to <br />keep alive the \\"rumor\\" that he (Billy Shields) is an <br />imposter. <br /> <br />The theory is that Paul was killed in a car accident. <br />Here on this cover we actually see Paul being hurled <br />from a moving car with a look of terror and anxiety <br />on his face. The fact that he is barefoot just as he <br />was on the cover of Abbey road is futher symbolism of <br />his death. Included in this album is another picture <br />of Of Paul using the hand of death sign as seen on the <br />cover of Sgt. Peppers. This story never ends........ <br />
B00005AQGH|5.0|Makaveli shows his whole hand on this album. You get a little political, you get some pain, you get something to dance to, and you get scathing diss songs for weak hearted rappers.

B000B2YQX4|5.0|I've listened to many electronic music from artists such as erasure, petshop boys, neworder and others and have noticed a distinctive progression from their original roots, some for the better but mostly for the worst. I realize technology has matured to a level that permits such artists to create beautiful melodic tapestries on which to ride the senses and imagination. Depeche Mode seems to get only better at it.  <br /> <br />Since I'm originally from Mexico and am hispanic, I tend to deviate from the norm and listen to something more alternative which I seem to enjoy, such as the electronic sounds created by english artists. However, I can honestly say that my preference to choose a favorite group has leaned towards Depeche Mode (I was a raving fan of Petshopboys once, but not anymore!). Hope to hear more unique and daring sounds such as found on this album. Enjoy! :)
1577314808|1.0|I agree with all of the recent reviews nearly all on this page alone, who found this book a waste of time. His title copies an american book of the same name printed twenty years ago and the ideas are exactly the same. How amazing is that. Enough said.
B000002ADT|5.0|I really can't add much to all that's been said about this wonderful album other than to add my kudos.  <br />The music is superb and the sound from the digital remastering is excellent.  <br />This album most certainly belongs in the collection of even the most casual jazz fan.
B00006AW2S|1.0|Alas, I purchased this CD expecting the US record, but I got the UK record. The only sort of good song is \\"Heart of Stone,\\" and the great songs I remember from the US version aren't there. It's strange to listen to this horrible record and think that this band would turn into the Rolling Stones I've loved for decades. I'd never heard most of these cuts before. The Stones here sound like a second rate bar band doing weak versions of old blues and R&B titles. It's amazing to me that this stuff got released. When I think about what they would be doing in a couple more years, I can still hear that blues and R&B influence, but they would become utterly themselves, much more polished, much better at leaving space in their songs, instead of just thrashing away. (They were already doing this in their best songs, such as \\"Satisfaction,\\" but not in the ones on the UK release.) Unless you are the sort who needs to have everything, you'd do better with one or more of the early hits records. Man, and I wanted \\"The Spider and the Fly,\\" but it's not on this UK version.
B000F1IQNM|5.0|That says a lot!  I really enjoyed this movie.  It was combination \\"Mary Poppins\\", \\"Sound of Music\\" (without the singing), and \\"Series of Unfortunate Events\\".  I loved it.  Emma Thompson seems to enjoy weird looking characters.  But the characters are lovable - even the kids! The colors are spectacular, and the lessons enjoyable.  Everyone is over-the-top, but it works. <br /> <br />As I said, my 16 year old (and 14 year old) daughters loved it too. At first they complained, and the oldest said she looked \\"scary\\".  But when I suggested they turn it off about midway, they said Please No! <br /> <br />That in itself is high praise that teens would sit through it - and want to again!  A must see and must purchase! Enjoy it!

As a mental health proessional, I lend this book out to my clients frequently and the feedback has been fabulous! Sometimes in session, they'll catch themselves and say something like, \\"Oops, I am assuming,\\" or \\"I'm taking this personally, aren't I?\\" It's been a fabulous therapeutic tool for my clients as well as myself.

B000AMJDHY|1.0|Oh Wow,  I'm really blown away by how many people actually think this band is great (let alone good).  Yes indeedy, the \\"great rock and roll swindle\\" took every last bill out of the safe.  Blahhh, boring annd self-absorbed.  Another eMTyV driven corporate band.  Fall Out Boy?  Blah.  And what's up with ITunes describing this bands music as \\"pop-influenced punk songs with theatrical touches and quirky techno beats\\".  Okay, whatever.      Punk band or pop band.  Can't have it both ways.  Time this generation woke up to the fact that punk and hardcore was the antithesis of \\"pop\\".  The two don't mix.  Oil and water.  Corporate EMO Pop Punk is just puke.  \\"Pop influenced punk songs\\" is like saying \\"Devil influenced christian songs\\".  Wake up and reject the marketing.  ***This is puke pop, plain and simple.  If you're seeking something that's truly fresh, avoid this corporate b.s. and dig around until you find one of the truly great indie bands.  You'll know it when you hear it.

B000021XR5|5.0|Believe it or not, but the Stone Temple Pilots first return album was their best.  This comes complete with a sense of personal and musical style that was never present before.  The varying styles of songs like \\"Atlanta\\" and \\"Sour Girl\\" versus \\"Down\\", \\"Heaven and Hotrods\\" and \\"No Way Out\\" is unbelievably apperant.  This album stretches in ways we have never seen the Stone Temple Pilots go, and successfully (unlike the \\"Shangri-la dee-da\\" cd).<br /><br />Great songs include \\"MC5\\", \\"Pruno\\", \\"No Way Out\\", \\"Heaven and Hotrods\\" and \\"Down\\".  Talk is cheap here as I have no idea what they are talking about even though they are well-pronounced lyrics.  A great example of this is \\"Church on Tuesday\\".<br /><br />This is not the same STP as before, I just think that it is better.  Yes, their first two cds were great and their third had its ups as well, but this still has more.  They are not this easy-to-lable act anymore, they are much deeper than that.  They are no longer just a hard rock/grunge band.  The Stone Temple Pilots fly higher than their extrordinarily high standards of music on this fantastic album.
B00005JOX6|5.0|Television and any other visual medium for that matter can have a profound effect on our lives and if you don't believe me watch and see, or write a note to a magazine about the TV. Remote controls are the subject of `Click'. I'm certain this film will resonate with anyone who loves television and the power of their remote control or the special feature functions found on a digital video disc (DVD) menu. To any women who are married to a man with his finger always on the button 'Click' could change all of that. To me there is nothing more annoying when watching television then someone flicking between channels. Anyone who encourages their children to go outside and play, or read a book is certainly always in the right, but might be in the minority here. Still if that is the case for you, it will not detract from the fun. This is just another type of playing most people employ on a daily basis.<br /><br />Frustrated with the constant hassle of having numerous remotes and never pushing the correct button for the correct appliance, overworked individual Michael Newman, (Adam Sandler - Anger Management, Punch Drunk Love, Big Daddy) goes beyond the call of duty and gets a break by being given a universal remote free of charge. Morty (Christopher Walken - Blast from the Past, Wedding Crashers) passes Michael the quintessential remote for everything, to use at his leisure, and in doing so fulfil his every whim and desire. Only unbeknownst to Michael, this remote control develops brains, and soon holds a secret memory of past events based on previous clicks, that it can't wait to use for Michel's own benefit or its own making life ultimately more pressing for him.<br /><br />An awesome array of talent we should all love to watch populate this films universe with the always ever lovely Kate Beckinsale, (Underworld, Underworld: Evolution, Pearl Harbour, Serendipity, Brokedown Palace, The Aviator), Henry Winkler (Happy Days, Arrested Development, Night Shift), Sean Austin (The Lord of the Rings, 50 First Dates, (also with Adam Sandler), The Goonies, 24).

0156030209|3.0|Yann Martel's Life of Pi starts when an elderly man says, \\"I have a story that will make you believe in God.\\" Life of Pi and its story does just the opposite; it questions the roots of faith with its central metaphor of the floating island. <br /> <br />The central character, Pi, whose real name Piscene (pool) has been distorted in childhood to Pissing assumes a name that measures the diameter of a circle, the symbol of omniscience, omnipresence, and omnipotence.  Pi tells two stories of being lost at sea--one story of a miraculous survival for 277 days of a boy on a boat with a Bengal tiger and another story of cannibalism and murder on that same boat whose occupants are Pi, a cook, Pi's mother, and a Taiwanese sailor.  Pi says, \\"So tell me . . .which is the better story?  And so it goes with God.\\"  Life of Pi concludes with the investigators for the shipwreck's cause choosing the first story in which the caged animals somehow all escaped from their cages as the ship Tsimtsum sank suddenly to the bottom of the Pacific as the more believable, but is the reader to do so? <br /> <br />Before choosing to believe the first story, Mr. Chiba, one of the investigators, makes associations between the hyena in the first story and the cook in the second; he sees the zebra in the first as the Taiwanese sailor in the second.  The orangutan in the first was Pi's mother in the second, and the tiger Richard Parker from the first is Pi in the second.  Then Mr. Chiba asks, \\"What about the island?  Who are the meerkats?  What about the teeth?  I don't know.  I am not inside this boy's head.\\" <br /> <br />Well, that acidic, man-eating island that spews up dead fish bodies by turning salty water into fresh water and its naïve meerkats that don't  run from the tiger's slaughter but act as if slaughter is to be expected are the heart of Life of Pi.  Fish are Christian symbols and Pi observes the meerkats bending over the pool looking for the fish and ties the meerkats into other faithssuccinctly, \\"To see so many beings bending down at the same time reminded me of prayer time in a mosque.\\" The tree in the middle of the island holds one fruit buried in countless leaves that turns out be not a fruit at all but a set of teeth belonging to a man who died and was absorbed by the tree.  Is this island with its nonbearing fruit trees a paradise, an Eden or is its offering merely survival on algae and dead fish?  The meerkats, Pi, and the tiger all flee from its acidic soil in the nighttime but return in the day.  Yann Martel's book portrays a harsh relationship between man and his universe as the tiger, Richard Parker, and Pi compete for survival and yearn for companionship.  Its affirmation of God is only in man's choosing to believe the story. <br />
B0009QTS1M|5.0|Maximus Desimus Meridias (sp?)...\\"there is no substitute\\"!! Five stars aren't enough. This is one of the best movies of all time. They couldn't have chosen a better cast. All actors play their characters perfectly. Especially, a shout out to Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix. Special effects are awesome, story is riveting, costumes first rate. First watched it at the theater on the big screen, and must have watched hundreds more times since. This is a MUST see. No home DVD library could be complete without it. FOR SURE!
B000E1ZBGS|2.0|Another example of the contemporary inability to render a classic in anything like its original intent, sense or form. Here we have a parade of third millennium anachronisms almost as preposterous as those on display in the equally absurd current rendering of \\"Tristan and Isolde.\\" Thus, our heroine Kiera Knightley sails through the whole film with a saucy, feminist tinged, \\"cat that swallowed the canary,\\" facial expression and vocal delivery, that suggest that she has been watching a great deal of Katie Couric and Elizabeth Vargas, and is dying to drop the word \\"empowerment,\\" somewhere into her dialogue. <br /> <br />Then there's the \\"incomparable,\\" Judi Dench--(as the publicity breathlessly assures us). For some incomprehensible reason, contemporary casting directors' are under the lamentable delusion that Miss Dench, (like Maggie Smith) is somehow suited to grande dame roles--when nothing could be further from the truth. <br /> <br />Having seen Miss Dench on stage in a five hour production of \\"Cymbeline,\\" at Stratford on Avon, I can personally attest to her range and power as an actress. However, whatever her qualifications for Shakespeare, there is nothing in her appearance or deportment that is remotely aristocratic in the 18th/19th century sense of the term. <br /> <br />Indeed, if anything, her persona is pronouncedly proletariat. <br /> <br />Add to that her coarse and rubicund complexion, (un-pancaked in the current naturalistic mode) and her Lady Catherine appears more like a refugee from a Hogarthian gin palace than the daunting and imperious creature Miss Austen intended. <br /> <br />Martita Hunt where are you now that we need you?  <br /> <br />There is little to say about Donald Sutherland in the role of Mr. Bennet, inasmuch as he has built a successful career out of being miscast--a feat he continues with this role. And his wife in the picture, (far from the lavender, rose silk and cream Mary Boland of yore) looks like a blowsy, overage bawd from thecast of a backwoods dinner theater production of \\"Moll Flanders,\\" who has somehow wandered onto the wrong movie set. <br /> <br />But mercifully we at length arrive at the priceless (and now requisite) final clinch, where Miss Knightley and Mr. Macfadyen are depicted in the lotus position on a lake in front of their château, where they proceed to launch into a demonstration of mutual affection that looks like a TV promo for \\"The Bachelor,\\" and makes one wonder if Brad Pitt and Julia Roberts are standing just outside of camera range whispering instructions. <br /> <br />For now if you absolutely require a filmed alternative to the novel itself--stick with the 1940 Greer Garson or unfairly ignored 1979 British TV version.

B000002J2F|5.0|I've been a big Genesis fan ever since the release of their 1980 album, Duke. Before that, I really didn't understand any of their work. Too artsy, too intellectual. It was on Duke where Phil Collins' presence became more apparent. I think Invisible Touch was the group's undisputed masterpiece. It's an epic meditation on intangibility. At the same time, it deepens and enriches the meaning of the preceding three albums. Listen to the brilliant ensemble playing of Banks, Collins and Rutherford. You can practically hear every nuance of every instrument. In terms of lyrical craftsmanship, the sheer songwriting, this album hits a new peak of professionalism.  Take the lyrics to Land of Confusion. In this song, Phil Collins addresses the problems of abusive political authority. In Too Deep is the most moving pop song of the 1980s, about monogamy and commitment. The song is extremely uplifting. Their lyrics are as positive and affirmative as anything I've heard in rock.  Phil Collins' solo career seems to be more commercial and therefore more satisfying, in a narrower way. Especially songs like In the Air Tonight and Against All Odds. But I also think Phil Collins works best within the confines of the group, than as a solo artist, and I stress the word artist. This is Sussudio, a great, great song, a personal favorite.
B000EQ4G5K|5.0|This album is way better than the previous one (Music of The Sun), it has the blend of pop, r&b, rock and hip-hop. I've always been a fan of Rihanna and its nice to see a artists (including Ciara) who don't have to curse or sing about sex in every song.    1- SOS - The lead single that peaked at #1 in many many countries. It was originally supposed to be recorded by Christina Milian but she wouldn't (maybe to poppy for her?). It has the music from Tainted Love with it, it's a great pop song to dance too. 10/10  2- Kisses Don't Lie - I hope that this is single #3. It's a blend of pop and rock and is very catchy. It's a nice fun loving summer track. It's about a girl who is \\"caught between yes and no\\" because kisses don't lie! 10/10  3- Unfaithful - The 2nd single. It's a ballad and I believe the song should sell well. It's about a girl who is cheating on her fella and doesn't wanna do it anymore because it's killing him, and she doesn't wanna be a \\"murderer\\". The song shows another side of Rihanna. 9.5/10  4- We Ride - Another potential single. Very much mainstream r&b. About a guy who doesn't fell the same way about a girl and she is trying to accept the fact that they both \\"ride\\" and nothing more will become of it. 9.5/10  5- Dem Haters - This song is a good collaboration between Rihanna and Dwane Husbands (who?). A lot of artists these days sing about people who hate them and how they don't care, but this track is more sophisticated and fun. Very much pop. 7/10  6- Final Goodbye - I didn't like this song at all at first, but it does grow on you. The song is about a girl finally telling a guy how she honestly feels for the first time before they part ways. 7/10  7- Break It Off (With Sean Paul) - This is a great club track, I think it's going to be a single (or is has been released?). It's more of a Sean Paul track, oppose to Rihanna, she has more of a feature bit. Great to dance too...7/10  8- Crazy Little Thing Called Love - Rihanna goes back to her island rootswith this track. I'd call it more of a filler track as the song doesn't build up to anything, maybe a track that was left off the previous album? 3/10  9- Selfish Girl - Another island track, sounds familiar to the previous song, a filler track. 3/10  10-  PS (I'm Still Not Over You) - A ballad, it's not the best song but it's not all that bad. I would say it is one of the weaker ones but still its bearable. Rihanna sings about a previous love that she still has strong feelings for. 5/10  11-  A Girl Like Me - I love this track! At first I thought it was very bland but its cool. Rihanna sounds a lil like Beyonce here, and I love the way she holds \\"Inside\\" during the last Bridge before the Chorus. Very classy, popish song. 8/10  12-  A Million Miles Away - It was very ironic because when I bought this album I could so relate to this track. Many of us have been in relationships were you drift away from each other and you cant understand what went wrong and how it happened. Well that's the feeling that Rihanna is singing in this track. Great way to close the album. 9/10  13-  If It's Lovin That You Want (Part II) - I never really liked this song to begin with hence not liking this remix version. 4/10  14-  Pon De Replay (Remix) - Very bass remix, its alright but its more about instruments than vocals here. 6/10    Overall I'd recommend this album highly. Its one of the best pop albums Ive heard in a while.    Best tracks:  SOS  Kisses Don't Lie  Unfaithful  We Ride
B00070Q7VO|1.0|I run all my CD's off my computer through my stereo speakers. This album was a major ripoff because it won't play on a computer (Mac). It may be because of some stupid piracy protection program. All machines (I have three) just ejected it. The result is that this album is worthless to me.  <br /> <br />What a joke!  <br /> <br />Before you waste your money, be sure and know what you're getting into.
B000F3A7LE|5.0|About this time, the time of Exposure's original release, there was a homeless fellow on a street corner in downtown Seattle who, each day, went to work informing the uniformly disinterested public that \\"The Air is Alive and Moving.\\" My friends and I tended to acknowledge this observation as both true and self-evident.<br /><br />If there is a single record -- and now a single record brilliantly restored -- that managed to integrate the countless ideas and directions available as they cut their various arcs through the culture and music at that time, it is \\"Exposure\\". Like few other records and even fewer musicians, Fripp shows us again that there's no sane reason to become satisfied with any single form of expression, any formulaic solution to the combination and recombination of elements that, when acted out in honesty, result in music. By bucking that most sacred aspiration of the music industry -- adherence to well-defined categorization -- we listeners were the ones being exposed. Exposed to found material. Exposed to the open loop on top of the closed beat. Exposed to personal and neighborly strife. Exposed to failure and success. Exposed to pop meets art music and a few big laughs. Exposed to the virtuosic in the divine and the banal.<br /><br />Ears wide open, Fripp puts on a show that literally encapsulates virtually every trend and idea still floating around the outskirts of alternative musics today. The resultant energy, range, pathos and humor that comprise the emotional carriage of \\"Exposure\\", along with the now famous and badge-of-honor worthy legal battles the work triggered within The Industry, are all earmarks of a record that is both of and about music free of categorization. We owe Fripp big time for doing it once, and again for his decades-long persistence in getting it to finally be what he knew it should always be.
B000FVQM2Y|5.0|Remember how many top-ten lists Mysterious Skin (also starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt) made last year-end? This will happen again, with BRICK. This is frequently compared with Donnie Darko, not in content but in the cult-following it garnered even tho it didn't make huge box-office waves. In fact, Brick stayed in the top ten in the UK for weeks this spring/summer. But enough PR, the film stands on its own merits, on so many levels: for its concept, script, performances, music, photography. Not to be missed.
B00005YW4H|5.0|Norah has a real voice, a little bit Jazzy, a little bit Folksy, a little bit Bluesy.  A true voice without the special effects.  This is not a singer who tries to sing out of her range, but a singer who understands her voice, and what it can do.  Very pleasant listening for an evening alone, or with a special someone.  I feel that the true voice singer has become such a rarety, and thus a great, great pleasure, when heard.  She is backed by a very capable set of musicians who add to the over all pleasure one derives from listening to this beautiful voice.  My overall favorite piece is, \\"I Don't Know Why\\".  But alas the pure voice singer I fear is destine to go the way of the Handcrafter, extinct.  Listen to a few samples, then download, or pick up a copy, if you like what you hear, and enjoy.
B000F6IOC0|3.0|I'm not in much of a mood for writing a full, good review, so here's a few random bullet points that ought to sum it up.<br /><br />-'Underworld: Evolution' looks cool, but not as cool as the original.  Still pretty damn good, though.  It is very blue and black.<br /><br />-'Underworld' had a stupid plot; 'Underworld: Evolution' has an even stupider plot.  Also, like the original, they make it very tough to know just what the hell is going on in this movie until very late despite the fact that there really isn't all that much to the plot.<br /><br />-The dialogue is either pure cheese or utterly perfunctory, but, you know, who cares.  At one point Selene says, `So the old legends are true...' I dunno about you, but I find that very funny.<br /><br />-This film has more action than the original, but it's a bit more uneven in quality.  The big fight at the beginning in medieval times is pretty damn cool, definitely the best one, but it's somewhat inconsistent after that.  Still, seeing a pack of werewolves fighting a bunch of armored vampires in hand to hand combat is something you don't see too often, and this alone practically makes the film worth a look.<br /><br />-The werewolves look much better this time around.  Course, they looked pretty crappy the first time, but now they look fairly good.<br /><br />-It's got some neat gore.  Not a ton, but it's there, anyway.  I particularly like one part where a werewolf gets his head pretty much ripped in half.  That was cool.<br /><br />-Apparently, if a vampire bites you, it steals your memories.  Huh.<br /><br />-Scott Speedman once again failed to make any sort of impression on me as that vampire/werewolf hybrid guy, despite the fact that he's supposed to be our co-hero.<br /><br />-Kate Beckinsale gets naked, albeit somewhat discretely, but it turns out she looks better in her leather suit.  ( In which, I must admit, she looks pretty damn good.)  As far as her ability as a action hero and protagonist.... ehh, she's serviceable.<br /><br />-The major sex scene in this film is fairly comical, as they so often are.<br /><br />-The vampires in this movie still don't act very, uhh, vampirey very much.  I'm not the biggest fan of vampires, mind you, but if you're gonna have a vampire movie you might as well have them act like `em, rather than just like really tough humans with peculiar fashion sense and funny accents.<br /><br />Yeah, I think I'm done.  This movie is passably entertaining, but not much more than that.  It's also over long despite the fact that it's only like 105 minutes long.  Still, if you liked the first one you'll probably find this to be worth a watch.<br /><br />Grade: Cst.... ehh, she's serviceable. <br /> <br />-The major sex scene in this film is fairly comical, as they so often are. <br /> <br />-The vampires in this movie still don't act very, uhh, vampirey very much.

B000EF5NAS|5.0|Every decade has its chick flicks that define those years and feature a who's who of up-and-coming actresses mixed with veterans. In the 1980s, it was Steel Magnolias and in the 1990s it was Fried Green Tomatoes, a southern folktale based on the novel by Fannie Flagg (who also co-wrote the screenplay).<br /><br />Fried Green Tomatoes is a beautiful shot film that really evokes the rich, lush setting of the Deep South. Director Jon Avnet also uses warm colours to create an inviting atmosphere that draws the audience in. There is real artistic integrity to the camerawork which gives the film a Classic Hollywood vibe.<br /><br />Fried Green Tomatoes is the perfect lazy Sunday summer afternoon movie that evokes simpler times. The film makes us appreciate taking the time out of our busy lives to stop and smell the roses as it were. The film espouses a simple yet important message of tolerance and compassion towards one another but not in a preachy way. It is a message that is certainly applicable today (maybe even more so) making Fried Green Tomatoes even more relevant.<br /><br />There are a collection of \\"Deleted Scenes\\" that are really just little bits of added footage tagged on at the end of or in-between scenes. There is nothing too memorable here.<br /><br />Also included, is an amusing collection of \\"Outtakes,\\" featuring flubs and blown lines.<br /><br />\\"Moments of Discovery: The Making of Fried Green Tomatoes\\" is an engaging, endearing retrospective documentary that runs just over an hour. Good news for fans is that Mary Stuart Masterson and Mary-Louise Parker contribute new interviews and warmly recall filming anecdotes, including working in the intense Georgian heat, how Masterson really handled all those bees and Parker's run-in with some nasty leeches. This is a must-watch for any fan of this movie.<br /><br />\\"Sipsey's Recipes\\" include actual recipes for over 15 dishes that are taken from Flagg's book and that allow you to recreate the Whistle Stop Caf&eacute;'s cuisine. This is a really nice touch.<br /><br />\\"Jon Avnet's Director's Notes\\" includes script excerpts with specific directions he used as a guide when making the movie.<br /><br />There are \\"Production Photographs\\" that include behind-the-scenes pics of the delicious food and also the movie crew at work.<br /><br />\\"Poster Campaign\\" features various poster designs for the movie, including some really nice hand-drawn ones that are quite artistic in nature.<br /><br />Finally, there is an audio commentary by director Jon Avnet. He takes us through his filmmaking process switching back and forth between talking about the themes of the film and production anecdotes.top Café's cuisine.

B000EPR7NE|5.0|The instant I learned that Hans Zimmer was replacing James Horner to score The Da Vinci Code, the soundtrack became my most-anticipated one of the year. Sure, Superman Returns will be quite the musical spectacle: broad and sweeping, no doubt. But the heroic motifs employed for that score must fit within the musical ideas that moviegoers already associate with the Man-of-Tomorrow (ie: the themes John Williams wrote). Composer Brian Ottman has creative license, obviously, but there's only so much room to move in a project like this. Same with other blockbusters this year, like Pirates 2 and Mission Impossible, for instance. Even the flop Posiedon had a musical niche already carved for it (which Klaus Badelt allowed himself to be \\"sucked\\" into). But with the Code, German composer Hans Zimmer (arguably one of the top 3 best soundtrack composers of all time) was able to create an entirely unique sound. He did not have to sound a certain way; HE got to decide how the music SHOULD sound. <br /> <br />And it is a beautiful sound! <br /> <br />The opening cue \\"Dies Mercurii I Martius\\" sets the pacing of the entire soundtrack. Heavy on the choir (this particular cut focuses on the female) with a steady underscore of violins (Hugh Marsh handles the electric violin). The soundtrack differs mightily from typical Zimmer fare in that it relies more on subtle harmonies and intricate string compositions than it does on heavy brass and wild synths. Still, this opening track contains the soundtrack's main theme, which is really a theme for the Grail, itself, and this is a powerful theme. While its full glory is never experienced till the second-to-last cut, \\"Dies Mercurrii\\" gives the general idea, before tailing off into Silas' motif. The latter is a series of brooding chords which suddenly crescendo into a wild 6-note violin theme used to accentuate the on-screen rites of the albino monk as he tortures himself (in the name of God). <br /> <br />The second track is primarily a mood setting. Strings play steadily throughout, and an 8-note brass motif adds some power. Track 3 opens like the first cue did, slowly building off of intermittant choral bursts until the music launches into Silas' theme. The electric violin here is haunting, and the images of self-flagellation--as Silas beats himself yet again--are intensified by the music. <br /> <br />The fourth cue \\"Fructus Gravis\\" is a discovery piece, and certainly one of the CD's highlights. At 2:49 it is the second-shortest on the CD, but I would have appreciated more. Unlike the longest cue \\"Daniel's 9th Cipher\\" at 9 1/2 minutes, \\"Fructus Gravis\\" is very interesting. It contains a splendid female soloist, and a riveting bit of chase music that gives us the Zimmer brass explosions he's famous for. <br /> <br />At just over six minutes \\"Ad Arcana\\" is a delightful piece. Mysterious and full of wonder, the piano variation of the first track's opening motif is a nice touch, and is beautifully enhanced by a harp. A Schindler's List-type violin solo adds a mournful voice, but it is distinctly religious--like the rest, and paints vivid pictures of towering cathedrals and large stain-glass windows. <br /> <br />Tracks 7 and 8 consist mostly of choirs, though the latter cue offers the first re-emergence of the Grail theme since track #1. \\"Poisoned Chalice\\" is the next one, though, and it is gorgeous. Religious, to the core, with a soaring female chorus. Half-way through, two female voices pick up the underscoring, and do it beautifully, showing once again, how the human voice is the world's most powerful, emotion-engendering instrument known to humanity! <br /> <br />\\"The Citrine Cross\\" contains a \\"jerky\\" stop-n-go variation of Silas' theme, as we are treated to its brazen motif for the third time. The choir is also more percussive here than at any other time; roiling with intensity, perhaps echoing the undying, ruthless passion of Silas, the misguided monk. Chimes distort the chorus at times, making for amore \\"chilling\\" sound, but it is applicable to the soundtrack. <br /> <br />\\"Rose of Arimathea\\" is dominated by the male chorus (a first in this score), and there is a somber bit here that is reminiscent of The Shining's classic horror soundtrack. Again, the religiousity of the movie's musical score is highlighted. <br /> <br />The second to last instrumental cue is entitled \\"Beneath Alrischa,\\" and it really only serves as a 4 minute, 23 second build up to the last cut \\"Chevaliers de Sangreal\\" which is the re-occurence of the \\"Grail Theme.\\" It is a loud and powerful outburst of brass and violins; an amazing \\"last hurrah\\" to a powerful soundtrack. <br /> <br />Filmtracks' review commented that \\"The best ... moments of awe should be credited to the chorus, which exists in both the higher ethereal female ranges and the deep chanting male depths that resurrect the broad scope of Crimson Tide. Zimmer's thematic development is subtle at every turn.\\" <br /> <br />In the end, I highly recommend this score, especially to the soundtrack purist. <br /> <br />RATING: **** 1/2 (out of 5)
B0000029GA|5.0|Vintage Nas + Instant Classic. What more can be said about Illmatic?   Here's my 2 cents. I think what separates Illmatic from a lot of the other great classics is that the album flows seamlessly together, very cohesive as if it's one well written movie or book. It's very identical to Eric B. & Rakim's \\"Paid in Full\\" in that respect. My favorites are Memory Lane, World is Yours, Represent, It aint hard to tell, One Love, New York State of Mind, Life's a B. Nas set a precedent for himself with Illmatic. Face it- He will have more hit singles, but he has yet been able to recapture fully the glory of Illmatic's cohesive-ness. I hope so because that's what the world wants to hear from him. Tell us how the little boy from the Queensbridge projects sees the world  now that he's in his early 30's and capture that. Talk about life's past hurdles and future foreseen ones as it relates to the 70/80's kids. Trim the fat and filler tracks and then we will have the real sequel to Illmatic.

0140042520|5.0|I've read criticism of this book that I found just did not hold water. Most who don't care for it complain that there is a shadow of commercialism hanging over it because after the success of ON THE ROAD, his publisher asked specifically for something \\"like ON THE ROAD\\" and so he delivered THE DHARMA BUMS. As if this single fact (even if true, which I somehow doubt) has any bearing on the quality of the writing or the success of how Kerouac expressed the ideas within the work.<br /><br />To me, it is one of the most successful of Kerouac's novels. The writing is extremely powerful and seems to echo after you put the book away. I also find it to be the most transporting of his books--there is a feeling of almost being in some of the places he describes. In this way, as far as place, it's more effective than his more well-known and widely admired pieces.<br /><br />This novel means a lot to me. It never fails to inspire me, and I often take a copy along when I go backpacking into a National Park or wilderness area.
B000ENC6XM|3.0|I never bothered to watch this movie until the HD DVD came out and now I know why.  While the movie is not terrible, there is absolutely nothing memorable about it.  I just watched it last night and am having a hard time recalling the plot.  Keanu Reeves plays John Constantine, a man condemned to Hell for trying to kill himself and trying to attain redemption by banishing demons back to the underworld.  I like Keanu, but most of the time he reminds me of Neo, his character in the Matrix trilogy.  And in the Matrix movies, he reminded me of his character Ted in Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure.  The rest of the cast, including Rachel Weisz, was fine, the special effects were good, and there were even a few funny moments.  I was never too bored while watching it, but in the end it left me feeling empty.  The HD DVD transfer is one of the better ones, but this movie is a rental at best. <br />

One can only say this about a release or two every year.

B000E33VWW|3.0|Having just read In Cold Blood last month, I was very disappointed in this movie.  The book is absolutely brilliant and unbiased.  With great empathy and attention to detail, Capote describes the brutal murders of four members of the Clutter family in Kansas.  He devotes equal attention to Perry Smith and Dick Hickcock, The two men who eventually confessed to killing the Clutter family.<br /><br />The movie focused so much on Capote as a person that it failed to develop the story of the Clutters.  Moreover, it made Truman Capote looked like a sad, pathetic, self inflated and manipulative journalist.<br /><br />Indeed, Capote spent six years of his life working on this masterpiece and it was one of the best books that I've ever read.  He clearly cared about all the characters involved, not just Perry Smith, with whom he identified and formed a strong bond.<br /><br />Having said that, Hoffman's acting job was brilliant and the movie certainly had some merits, but it dragged towards the end and was imminently predictable.<br /><br />For those who truly want to know about the mass murders in Kansas, read the book!

And it's right back into the headbanging, the chills, singing/screaming along with lyrics that still don't make perfect sense to me (\\"intravenously polite/ it was the walkie-talkies that knocked the pins down/ as her shoes gripped the dirt floor/ in the silhouette of dying\\"--\\"Invalid Litter Dept.\\"), but will nonetheless grow with me for the rest of my life, like Joyce's _Finnegans Wake_ or poems by Celan.<br /><br />Really, this is as good as anything Mars Volta has done (MV is my favorite operating band followed closely by Radiohead and Wilco--hallowed company!). _Relationship of Command_ is really the leaping board to the heights unknown they have reached with MV. It is also the culmination of the considerable accomplishments of ATDI, while representing a quantum leap from their nonetheless excellent preceding LP, _In/Casino Out_. What makes it a diving board to MV is the fact that we hear more of the stratospheric guitar from Omar than we had heard on previous ATDI releases and the song-writing and lyrics are leaning more towards byzantine prog tendencies. What makes it still ATDI and the culmination of everything they did is that it is still just punk, except it is refined by Andy Wallace's huge production skills and the band's (especially Omar's and Cedric's) relentlessly visionary drive.

B00005JNS0|4.0|4 and 1/2<br /><br />I will never, for the life of me, understand why Michael Eisner, the former head of Disney, even entertained the notion of ending Disney's relationship with Pixar. Disney's recent animated efforts pale in comparison to Pixar's. For proof of this, take a look at the Disney theme parks; Pixar characters are everywhere, in rides, as characters meeting the public, in parades, in shows. You would be hard pressed to find any representation from \\"Treasure Planet\\", \\"Chicken Little\\" or \\"Hercules\\". You might see Chicken Little doing a `Character Meet and Greet', but that's about it. Disney needs Pixar. And vice versa. No other movie studio has a marketing machine geared towards and a reputation for family films.<br /><br />The two are a match made in heaven.<br /><br />When you produce such consistently great films, as Pixar does, it becomes necessary to rate them against themselves. There is no other scale; they have raised the bar too high. Rating \\"Cars\\" on the same scale as DreamWorks's \\"Over the Hedge\\" just isn't going to work. \\"Hedge\\" is good, but Pixar films are in a class by themselves. It becomes a matter of is it \\"Toy Story/ The Incredibles\\" good or simply \\"Monsters, Inc\\" good? \\"The Incredibles\\" and the \\"Toy Story\\" films represent modern examples of perfection in the art of animation. For that matter, there are few live action films that can compare. \\"A Bug's Life\\" and \\"Monsters, Inc\\" are both very good, but they aren't perfect. \\"Cars\\", the newest film from Pixar, with the voice talents of Paul Newman, Owen Wilson, Bonnie Hunt and John Ratzenberger, is very good, but it's \\"Monsters, Inc.\\" good. It isn't perfect.<br /><br />Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson), a rookie car on the Piston Cup circuit, has the moves and attitude to win the Cup, upsetting the King (Richard Petty), the veteran in his last race, and Chick Hicks (Michael Keaton), the venerable also-ran determined to win. After a three-way tie, the cars head out to California to perform for the title. Lightning upsets his third pit crew of the year, all of whom quit, and he sets off to California with simply his truck, Mack (John Ratzenberger). Lightning pressures Mack to drive through the night and along the way, Lightning gets separated and lost. He ends up in Radiator Springs, a sleepy little town on Route 66, far off the interstate. Disoriented, Lightning causes some damage and Sally (Bonnie Hunt), a Porsche, who lives in the town wants to see the damage repaired, pressuring Doc Hudson (Paul Newman), the town's judge, to order Lightning to fix the road before he leaves. Determined to get to California, Lightning tries to fulfill his duty but gets distracted by the residents of Radiator Springs.<br /><br />Directed by John Lasseter (\\"Toy Story\\" and its sequel), \\"Cars\\" is a beautiful, richly detailed look at a world where cars live just like humans. Nearly great, the film has many things going for it and one key thing working against it.<br /><br />Both a brilliant idea for an animated film and a brilliant marketing concept, \\"Cars\\" has a lot going for it. With NASCAR gaining popularity every week, this animated effort seems guaranteed to receive some cross-over. Also, how quickly can they retrofit the Speedway attractions at the theme parks? Let's freshen those babies up.<br /><br />From the opening scenes, depicting a race at the Motor Speedway of the South, the computer generated animation is flawless in design and detail. Really, the only detail telling us this film is animated is the faces on the cars. Beyond that, the scenery and production design are flawless. We believe we are watching a real race at a real speedway (complete with cars filling the stands, doing the wave, and RVs parked in the center of the track) and the scenes of Lightning speeding through the landscape look like they were filmed, the landscapes appear so real I could almost smell the pine trees and the desert wind blowing across the open plain. The shots of Lightning and Sally driving through the forest are simply stunning. When they visit Ornament Valley, the rocks are beautiful and look like hood ornaments. When the race car arrives at Radiator Springs, the filmmakers have created a loving tribute to the little towns, motels, businesses, tourist attractions and icons which used to dot Route 66 during its heyday.<br /><br />All of the cars are created with loving detail, each based on an actual car or vehicle. Even the car governor of California is a Hummer with an Austrian accent. Lightning is a race car, I'm going to guess a Mustang, I couldn't quite identify him, but Porsches, Ferraris, Buicks, Hudson Hornets and more, both old and new, make an appearance.<br /><br />The voice talents are, as always, exceptional. Owen Wilson brings the right blend of cocky upstart and guts to Lightning McQueen.  When he eventually realizes what his life is missing, and what he needs to do to fix it, we believe it. Paul Newman is perfect as Doc Hudson, the elder statesman of Radiator Springs. Once a powerful, cocky star in his own right, he prefers the quiet life in his little town. I read Newman, car buff that he is, suggested his character's make and model, giving Doc Hudson even more detail. He also has the right amount of gravelly intonation for a car fifty plus years old; you can imagine the carburetor adding to Doc's voice, in much the way Newman's voice adds resonance to the character. Hunt is good as the Porsche looking to protect and preserve the town and its inhabitants. Larry the Cable Guy is amusing as Tom Mater, the tow truck who is a few spark plugs short of a full engine. Tony Shalhoub plays Luigi, a little Italian car who runs the local tire shop and is obsessed with all things Ferrari. A number of real-life race car drivers make cameos as their cars and Tom and Ray, the Car Talk Guys from NPR, play the owners of Lightning's poorly funded sponsors.<br /><br />I have to give a lot of credit to Pixar. They could've so easily made the race cars even more realistic and covered them with real sponsors, much like the real thing. Thankfully, we are spared from watching endless logos for Home Depot and the like. Instead, all of the sponsors are fictional, and provide a level of humor to the tale. Lightning's sponsors are Rust-Eze, the rear bumper rust lubricant. He longs to be sponsored by Dinoco, a large oil company. Get it? Dinoco, large oil company. Dinosaurs. Oil. Chick (Keaton) is sponsored by HTB, Hostile Takeover Bank. These are cute jokes, some of which are worked into the story, providing another level of detail to an already richly observed universe.<br /><br />The problem with \\"Cars\\" is pacing. The film seems long and ten or fifteen minutes edited out middle would've improved the film greatly, giving it a faster rhythm, making it nearly unforgettable. As it is, the middle drags and we begin to fidget in our seats a bit.<br /><br />\\"Cars\\" is fun, amusing and brilliantly designed. Sure to provide amusement for everyone in the family. As I have said many times, the mark of a classic animated film is it entertains the kids as well as the adults who have to take them. Would it entertain just adults? I heard a lot of laughter from adults, and a lot of laughter from the kids. At times a chorus, at others one group could be heard over the other. I can't imagine a better family film until maybe the next Pixar release, in summer, 2007, \\"Ratatouile\\", about a rat trying to eat good food in Paris.nd Sally driving through the forest are simply stunning.

B00003CWPL|5.0|Should I give this movie 5 stars, or any stars, or any rating of any sort?     Despite several attempts I've never been able to finish watching it.    This is one of the most profoundly disturbing movies I've ever tried to watch. There's little blood or gore, no jump-out-of-your-seat shocks, no really scary monsters... But it achieves its effect without them, just through the use of some very graphic imagery, unusual camera angles, grating 'music', that all reach inside your mind and twist it around.    I've never felt sick or scared from (trying to) watch Eraserhead... but I've never caught a wink of sleep for nights aferwards either.

The only singeles that were good Use your illusion 1 & 2 had were not even there own they were covers. If thats not alarm bells ringing of in their head before they release it i don't know what is. If they put the best songs on 1 cd and released it would still be [...]   Thank god everyone else besides axel have had brilliant recording & releases since the break up of guns & roses, because axels a loser & everyone else deserves it for putting up with him.

B000003TAR|5.0|OK the point is this is a great album, in fact the last great album. im not gunna give you a detailed version of each of the songs on the album like the other guys do. but if you like grunge then you'll like this. if you favor love songs or crying songs about girls then this isnt for you. this album isnt one themed, and isnt just a jumble of power chords and distortion. alot of people who write reviews on here give the album (and other nirvana albums aswell) a bad rating without even hearing it. they are worried that the bands they like are being shadowed by nirvana, which they probably are because nirvana is a great band. This album starts off about people like that \\"serve the servants\\" talks about self appointed judges and Hypocrites. This is a great album if you dont like it write a review on here telling why and not that you like pearl jam better. and please actually listen to the album
B00008LOS1|5.0|Who's Next is a classic album along with all the other Who albums. This 1971 album brought the Who up higher after their 1969 smash hit Tommy. First off, Who's Next is a great album by itself. It shows the great chemistry of the band with Townshend's genius writing and guitar, Daltrey's vocals, Entwistles' bass and Moon's drums. Who's Next had the classic hits \\"Won't Get Fooled Again\\", \\"Behind Blue Eyes\\", and \\"Baba O'Riley\\" and many more. These all show how good the Who were and how they helped revolutionize rock 'n roll.  <br /> <br />Disc one has all the songs from Who's Next and six other Who tracks recorded the New York Record Plant session. These these tracks include \\"Pure and Easy\\" and \\"Baby Don't You Do It\\", songs not included on Who's Next. These remasterd songs are so amazing, and different from the regular studio album releases. \\"Won't Get Fooled Again\\" and \\"Getting in Tune\\" were previously unreleased.  <br /> <br />Disc two is all live versions of Who songs played at the Young Vic for and invited audience. It has a couple of the songs that appeared on Who's Next and nine other songs from other Who albums. Popular live song \\"Naked Eye\\" is performed on the CD along with \\"Water\\", \\"My Generation\\", \\"I Don't Even Know Myself\\" and \\"Pure and Easy\\". A majority of these tracks had not been available. Overall the CD is a good buy. The whole 'Deluxe Edition' series is fantastic. Any fan who wants to have a good collection of the Who should own this CD.

I especially loved the first chapter when we discover how Colin \\"fell\\" for Penelope.  As always, Quinn makes me laugh out loud.  I did feel like Colin progressed from being totally unconcerned about Penelope, to considering her a friend, to madly in love with her all at lightning speed.  That is my biggest complaint, but overall I enjoyed the book.  The whole series is excellent.  I also liked the Lady Whistledown drama as well.

Still, I LOVE THE BOOK.<br />A MUST HAVE FOR ALL Babies.  Ages 1month-5 years.

Christopher Reeve was the perfect choice for the part of the handsome young man from the planet Krypton. Reeve was virtually unknown at the time but producer Alexander Salkind and director Richard Donner took a chance that his looks would overshadow any potential lack in acting ability. Boy did they make the right choice and yes he can act too!<br /><br />Surrounded by a stellar cast and a big budget to boot this film defined the process of how to translate a comic book superhero into a highly successful film.<br /><br />A true classic in the genre of superhero movies.

Watching it made me dust off \\"A Funk Odyssey\\" - a CD I didn't like upon first hearing. However, the concert made me appreciate the music on it alot. One cool thing about the DVD is the multi-angle feature enabling you to view the concert from different vantage points. There's also a little documentary (mainly a camera following Jay Kay around) and that was a nice addition. I'm glad I found the DVD - a definite MUST for Jamiroquai fans.
B000E97Y6K|3.0|Let me state that I did think the movie was decent, but I feel Jackson went overboard on this one. Honestly the first hour was so utterly boring that I had to pinch myself to stay awake. I suggested to all my friends to come an hour later, to have a much better experience than I did. Yet, I thought the effects were top notch and  also that there was some great action sequences. However, some scenes like the stupid ice skating scene with Kong and the whole story between the kid and the sailor were just ridiculous. People argue that the first hour was to set up the story, yet that wasn't really the case because most of this hour involved over-acting and boring minor stories that don't really matter. This is King Kong, it does not have to be an epic like the Lord of the Rings. Basically the story is there is a big ape,  the ape likes a girl, and the ape wrecks the city. That is it!!!! I really  hope Jackson doesnt think he needs to make all of his movies 3 hours or more.
0385495323|5.0|This book is an excellent one that intertwines the history, strategy, and mathematics of  those dedicated to encrypting messages and those dedicated to exposing the encryption strategy and thus the message. It explains the idea behind several kinds of encryption strategies starting with Mary Queen of Scots and how her personal involvement in the plot against Queen Elizabeth I of England was exposed when her correspondence that was encrypted with simple monoalphabetic substitution was decyphered.<br /><br />This method was replaced with the polyalphabetic Vigen&egrave;re square, which protected military and government dispatches for 250 years, until the Victorian polymath Charles Babbage, who believed that the cipher was flawed in some small way, set about the task of finding that flaw, and eventually did so.<br /><br />Chapter 3 discusses how the invention of radio at the beginning of the 20th century enabled cryptanalysts to easily gather large amounts of intelligence, since anyone with an antenna could easily intercept enemy communications, thus driving the need for stronger encryption methods. This resulted in the \\"mechanisation of secrecy,\\" the creation of machines to scramble messages beyond the manual abilities of human beings. This contributed to the public-key cryptography widely used today by businesses and governments.<br /><br />The next chapter is about the Enigma machine, used by the Germans leading up to and during the Second World War, which performed a complex polyalphabetic substitution cipher. The book discusses how Alan Turing, a brilliant mathematician who devoted himself to the war effort, helped to crack the Enigma code machines used by the Germans. Turing and his colleagues' breakthroughs prevented U-boat attacks and ultimately shortened World War II, but because of the British intelligence community's policy of maintaining secrecy for its operations, his important work in this field was never recognized.<br /><br />\\"Language Barrier\\" discusses how the American military used Navajo Indians as code talkers because of the unique characteristics of their language. It also discusses the Rosetta Stone and how it was used to decode a lost language by using two other known languages.<br /><br />\\"Alice and Bob Go Public\\" discusses the solution to the so-called key-distribution problem.  It talks about how James Ellis, employed by the UK Government Communications Headquarters,  worked out how to achieve effective public key cryptography several decades before American academics published their solutions, and what those solutions were.<br /><br />In \\"Pretty Good Privacy\\" Singh talks about what sort of line that law enforcement agencies should take pertaining to civil liberties. This leads up to the story of Pretty Good Privacy and Phil Zimmermann's battle with the government.<br /><br />The final chapter is about quantum cryptography. The advantage this method has over traditional methods is that the exchange of information can be shown to be secure in a very strong sense, without making assumptions about the intractability of certain mathematical problems. Even when you assume the presence of hypothetical eavesdroppers with unlimited computing power, the laws of physics guarantee (probabilistically) that the secret key exchange will be secure, given a few other assumptions. I found Singh's explanation of this topic a bit more difficult to grasp than those in previous chapters.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book as a starting point for anyone interested in the subject of cryptography. Even if you are not interested in going any further with this subject, it is an accessible and interesting read.usses how the American military used Navajo Indians as code talkers because of the unique characteristics of their language.

B00070Q7VO|5.0|I know that most of the people say that he's unique and has a great voice. Yes he does. I just like he sings these jazz classics with a twist but that doesn't he's the best.In another words, he's just a normal singer who got a nice voice, that's all.<br /><br />For the album, there's a good choice of songs for all occasions but not for the Jazz hardcores. He should write new songs of his own for his next record...so to me Buble, just attracts pple to the world of jazz, that's all!<br /><br />And that I think its a big contribution to world of jazz. I give my credits for his \\"pop jazz\\"phenomenon.Kudoz!
B000BNX3B4|3.0|\\"Must Love Dogs\\" is a romantic comedy of sorts starring Diane Lane and John Cusack. Not the best romantic comedy I've ever seen, but it's watchable enough.  <br /> <br />A divorced kindergarten teacher (Diane Lane) needs a man in her life, and she's not the only one who thinks so. The local butcher, for one, would be a lot happier, as she'd buy a lot more meat from his department in the supermarket. Her parents try to set her up with strangers, her friends suggest having an affair, some relatives even suggests she gets together with her cousin! There is one man she fancies though, a soon-to-be divorced parent of one of her young students.  She also doesn't mind a historical boatmaker (John Cusack) who she met on the Internet, thanks to her sister. Who will she choose? Which one is for her? The boatmaker loves dogs, as she does, but the parent has a kid, and she's always wanted children. Decisions, decisions... <br /> <br />The cast is enjoyable enough, and play likeable characters. John Cusack's demeanour in the film reminded me a bit of a young Bill Murray. Still, the story didn't grab me that much, and there wasn't anything I considered that big a laugh in it. <br /> <br />Special features include one outtakes reel (with optional commentary) as well as a selection of deleted scenes. <br /> <br />I love dogs, I have a Rhodesian Ridgeback and a Kelpie at home, but I can't really say I love this film. It'd be a good rent for a rainy day, though.
0553381350|5.0|For those familiar with the history of manned space flight, most of the information in this book is familiar. But there are also some \\"what if\\" alternatives mentioned. For instance, Shepard wanted a 3-day Mercury flight in 1963 following the flight of Cooper's Faith 7. This never came to pass. Considering how far the US was behind the USSR in man hours of space flight, this would have been a good idea.
0823016714|3.0|The Good: A wide range of ages and ethnic groups represented, which is better than the average reference book of this type.<br /><br />The Bad: Gurning, most of the models seem to thing they are in a cartoon. The photography is average and the reproduction is not great. The \\"Art Inspired By...\\" is absolutely dreadful for the most part and a waste of space. If we bought the book I should think we know what to do with it and don't need the, mostly poor, \\"inspirational\\" illustrations.<br /><br />I'll use this book, but I was hoping for better.
B00000AFGM|4.0|Never thought much of Marilyn Manson, other than a visual artist with a pretty sophisticated Gothic act. I felt like buying two of his CDs on iTunes (Antichrist Superstar and Mechanical Animals). ACS's popular songs \\"The Beautiful People\\" and the like were pretty much all I had seen about Marilyn Manson.    But when I started playing Great Big White World I almost immediately went \\"Wow, wait a sec--this sounds interesting...\\"    I really like this CD, almost every song in it.
B000DZIGDU|1.0|When I first saw this movie, I thought, \\"This is so stupid.\\" There was no plot at all. All the guys do is hang out at camp and run around the desert. The never even shoot at an enemy. Not ONE SINGLE SHOT. It's also a rip off of Stanley Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket. Jarhead even copied Full Metal Jacket's lines. If you go to rent a war movie, and you come across Jarhead, spit on the box and rent a different movie.
0393327655|4.0|This is most definitely a book you'll either love or hate, because whether or not you'll end up agreeing with Harris you'll still be moved by his words. For good or bad. <br /> <br />The End of Faith is quite likely the most brutal and in-your-face criticism of religious faith I've ever read, and one thing is for sure: Harris is VERY convinced that the monotheistic faiths and their followers are our version of Mordor and its evil creatures determined to ruin the world as we know it. More or less every single page of the book contains one or more sneers (some of them quite funny, too) aimed at the insanity in believing ancient scriptures and ideas that cannot be proven empirically nor discussed rationally. In Harris' universe, this world of ours will face utter ruin any day now, and the religions - especially Christianity, Judaism, and Islam - are all to blame. <br /> <br />But how about his way of arguing? Does that hold? Well, not really, because even though he admits that religious faith can be a good and positive thing for people, he still focuses on the evil that they do, and according to him, even the most benign and peace-loving believer is a threat to the world. Sure, it would be both ignorant and stupid to ignore the fact that the three religions and their writings contain numerous parts about violence, death, and human suffering (the God of the Old Testament is, after all, one of the cruellest ones ever), but something as complex and nuanced as religion and religious faith must be put in their proper contexts and approached from all sorts of different angles. Or in other words, one can never get a good understanding of them by only focusing on their evil sides. <br /> <br />But this is exactly what Harris does in his book. Still, I found myself enjoying it tremendously since I shared many of his ideas even before I read it. Reviewing a book should be done using an objective approach, and thus I'm very biased. Sorry about that. <br /> <br />It doesn't come as much of a surprise that thousands upon thousands of people all over the world hate Harris' guts, because I don't think I've ever read a book that paints such a negative, horrible picture of everything religious in the world. After its initial publication a few years back Harris' received tons of letters from readers - where some loved him and some despised him - and in this version a new afterword has been added where some of the questions the first edition raised are answered. This short section is perhaps the most interesting one in the whole book, because here you'll find questions and answers to some of the things that you as a reader are likely to have come up with during the course of your reading.  <br /> <br />So what can I say? I'm a sucker for this book, even though I'm aware of its flaws.  <br /> <br />I never vote, I'm not even American, but if Harris ever chooses to run for President I'll nonetheless try to find a way to vote for him.
B000FC2FVA|5.0|A warning to Phoenix fans, this is not like their other albums.  It takes some getting used to and it will take a few listens, but this CD is awesome!  A CD that will be in my car for the rest of the summer and longer!  I listen to it over and over and don't get tired of it.  Hopefully, I never will.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|I started watching supernatural after i caught a rerun of the episode \\"bloody marry.\\" My wife saw a commercial for the episode and we decided to watch it. We caught every episode since then but we didn't get to watch a couple of episodes at the beginning. I don't by many movies. I have never bought a tv series dvd. I will be buying this dvd when it comes out. That should tell you wow good this series is. BUY THIS DVD!!!!!
B000BW7QWW|5.0|You can still enjoy 'Serenity' if you haven't watched 'Firefly,' but you may enjoy it more if you watch the show first (plus, 'Firefly' is brilliant). <br /> <br />'Serenity' offers an action packed thrill ride through government conspiracies while highlighting a small woman kicking booty!  But, as per usual, Whedon's work functions on many levels, and this is no shallow action movie.  There is:   <br /> <br />   - character development (due to time constraints it's limited to 2 of the main characters - Mal and River);  <br />   - a plot that's far superior to many in this field;  <br />   - a message via an ethical/political issue to ponder;  <br />   - an interesting villain; <br />   - and smoothly blended in humor/drama/romance.  <br />  <br />Add to this wonderful writing, amazing acting, and great special effects (especially for the tight budget they were working with).  Nathan Fillion and Summer Glau shine in portraying both torment and triumph (I focus on them because the film does - 'Firefly' shows that the entire cast is talented).  Even if you don't typically like sf, you should enjoy this film.
B000F0UV0E|5.0|This is the 108th review, so there's little insight to add regarding the uncommon loveliness of this disc except to parse my friend's response to it upon hearing it in my car: \\"This is an album that makes me want to like music again.\\" I second that. Emmylou's had an entire second career as a duet partner (would be easier to make a list of folks she HASN'T sung with). She could have just phoned in her performance and it would've still shimmered with the regal elegance for which she is resoundingly lauded & admired, but instead she really makes Mark Knopfler WORK, which he tackles with aplomb & comes off as a real charmer.  <br /> <br />Some voices just love each other. George & Tammy, Porter & Dolly, Barry & Barbra, Linda & Aaron, Gillian & Dave, Bing & Judy. Indeed, Knopfler's a country crooning Crosby to Emmy's game Garland, particularly on the randy Red Staggerwing & Harris' heartbreakingly beautiful Love & Happiness For You, complete with the \\"ruby shoes\\" reference.  <br /> <br />SERVING SUGGESTIONS: Western Wall: The Tucson Sessions (Emmy with Linda Ronstadt) or Teatro (Emmy with Willie Nelson), and, of course, Emmy with the late Gram Parsons.  And throw in Emmy's Duets disc for good measure!
0679736646|5.0|\\"Ubik\\" is one of Dick's best books, but I should qualify how I'm defining best.  By best I mean that it's one that I can read time and time again without ever feeling as though I've 'got' it.  This is no comfy sweater book - you're not going to slip between its pages for a mind numbing reaffirmation of the beauty of life.  Instead you're going to enter his black humor masterpiece that opens itself up to various interpretations - a satire of late capitalism, a metaphysical quandry, a who-done-it - all with a healthy dose of ontological angst.  Add in a postmodern (or at least quasi-pomo) narrative further problematized by the ending, and you've got a book that will make you think.  Therefore, for some, 'Ubik' may not be the best Dick book to start with ('Time out of Joint' provides an early entry into his canon), but it's a great one to return to repeatedly.    Many of the ideas presented in this novel are some of Dick's best.  A prolonged period of artificial half-life maintained after death proves both a comfort to living loved ones and a lucrative business venture.  Psi powers can be effectively blocked by anti-psis - as long as you can afford to pay them for the service.  You may own your conapt, but you'll still have to pay your door every time you want to open it, or else it can sue you.  And how can your dead boss appear on money, matchbook ads, and TV?    Dick turns almost all of the Golden Age of sf conventions on their heads:  there are no heroes triumphing majestically - just normal, little people; technology hasn't solved all of our problems - instead it just lets advertisers hound us more thoroughly; his near futures are weirdly dystopic.  In fact, for Dick we can not even take for granted that we know what reality is or what it means to be human.  If this sounds normal for what you watch and read now (he's had a huge impact on sf and mainstream fiction, from 'The Matrix' and 'The Truman Show' to Gibson and Pynchon), just remember he started doing this in the 50s!  No one book can capture all of what Dick has to offer, so try a few before making a final judgment as to whether his work appeals to you.
B000B7HZXM|5.0|i hope rod s. is as happy as we are after 56years of marrage! <br />this cd says everything about our merrage! THE UPS AND DOWNS and THANKS FOR THE  <br />MEMEROYS, ROD! <br />
B0000AQS0F|5.0|A long-time Whedon fan, I actually cried a little when Fox aired the two hour pilot as the last episode before cancellation - it was the last 'Firefly' I thought I was ever going to see and it was brilliant.  Since then I've watched this box set repeatedly; with the episodes in order and the addition of never-aired material, I think I'm even more inclined to morn.  The film 'Serenity' may have provided closure to the plot lines begun by 'Firefly,' but only a long running TV show could do justice to the character development evinced in the 14 episodes we have here.    And that's what makes this show so amazing - that Whedon, Minnear and company were able to flesh out 9 characters in only 14 episodes.   They easily could have been stereotypes, but none are (just watch 'tough guy' Jayne braid a woman's hair in \\"Heart of Gold\\" to see such an example).  Similarly, the premise of the show also avoids many stereotypical sf tropes - there are no aliens, the atmosphere is gritty and lived in instead of sterile and perfect, it's a future world that's a blend of cultures instead of predominantly anglo, there are a range of strong female characters, the writers have fun with language, etc.  It also provides a blurring of genre boundaries - part sf, part western, part drama, part comedy, part romance, part action/adventure.  Finally, there's interesting camera and CGI work done here - part of the way to make the show look real instead of artificially perfect is using zooms and temporarily out-of-focus shots in the CGI work.  This was so effective it was copied for the new 'Battle Star Galactica' show.  If you're looking for something with brilliant writing, acting and character development, look no further.  You have the joy of watching 'Out of Gas,' 'Objects in Space' and the pilot 'Serenity' for the first time ahead of you. This show even appeals to people who don't typically like sf.
B000F5GO0A|5.0|Being a fan of world music and Indie, I find this album really a striking one. <br />  <br />The special vocals immediately made me think of Rufus Wainwright, Beirut's tone of voice + melody lines, but without the bombast and technique of Rufus. Luckely. Because that's the whole charm of this CD; the friction between Beirut's \\"soft\\" timid singing, versus the \\"loud\\" brassy music. They meet eachother in a fragile, strong feeling/ introvert &lt;---> extrovert. -In other words, the not so steady singing, the not so steady music, is where Beirut becomes one for me as a listener. <br /> <br />Therefore, also compliments for the album's production, overal it sounds very spontaneously and open. ...That's perhaps the hardest thing to catch on a record IMO, but they managed to keep Beirut's fun, soul and essence. ~Chapeau! <br /> <br /> <br />All songs put together; a remarkable piece of work & absolutely worth buying/ a must have for your collection when interested in world music and/or Indie. This combines the two in a very creative and surprising way.
B000FBGBPC|5.0|The second album from this Canadian import, the guys maintained momentum from their last album and have created another winner.  Start to finish, polish just perfect, not to shiny clean, and thank god for not going cookie monster.  This album seems to have evolved a bit more, a bit more processing, seems to have more studio effects, which is great.  They have kept all of their old edge, and given it some new flavor.  A front runner in this first half year's best albums in my book.
B000002VCU|4.0|This is a very melodic and indispensable cd for any collection. It explores medieval music with AP pop rock in an elegant manner. No groundbreaking song such as Ammonia Av, Silence and I, etc.
B00005JOYA|4.0|Silent Hill is the first video game adaptation that hasn't horribly been messed up.  In fact, it almost seemed like an actual horror movie as opposed to those who saw the commercial for 'Doom' and didn't see it because it was based on a video game. <br /> <br />Where should I begin, I love how they use the music from the games for some uniqueness, and they implement it very well.  The best effect is the transition from the 'other world' to the realm of darkness.  I was amazed how they did the transformation scenes from the moment the sirens started booming.  In the games, for the most part, they didn't show that transition as well as they did in the movie.  That is one of the major pluses of the movie.  We also get a variety of interesting monsters that appear.  We get those creepy children from the first game, the creepy deformed nurses, and pyramid head are some of the monsters that show up. <br /> <br />There are some problems though with the storyline and that upsetted some of the fans as well as me.  For the first part, they changed Dahlia Gillespie, the creepy lady who is Alessa's mother.  In the game she is a part of the cult and she is not a good guy.  She keeps her mysterious aura and some of her lines, but she reminded me more of Claudia from SH3. <br /> <br />The biggest disappointment for me was the change in Alessa.  Alessa is supposed to be a supernatural girl who wanders around Silent Hill.  She is a nice girl who gets treated very crudely and ends up being in really bad shape (don't want to spoil it though).  In the movie, she then becomes hateful and wants revenge.  But in the game she splits part of her soul to create Cheryl (Sharon in the movie) so she won't complete something that could cause a lot of trouble and pain.  She just randomly will appear in the game, whereas in the movie she trying to tell her story by leading the mother around and get revenge on a cult. <br /> <br />So, you might enjoy this movie if you like good horror flicks.  It isn't the best, by any means, but it's still one to rent or pick up.  Some people were complaining about the ending and how it was wrong to just stop there.  However, I am used to that because that's how Konami liked to end their games with you thinking about what just happened, especially if it involves dogs or UFO's.

1932907009|5.0|I'll be honest, over the last decade I've been a professional screenwriting student.  If there's a screenwriting class available, I've taken it.  If there's a book, I've read it.  I've completed a few scripts, none has sold, but I feel like each was better than the last.  At this point, I didn't think I needed any more schooling and I certainly didn't think I'd ever read another \\"how-to\\" screenwriting book.  Then I picked up SAVE THE CAT.  And I couldn't put it down.  Mr. Snyder has boiled down the essence of his years of experience (successes and admitted failures) into a colorful, lively, brilliant book that's as fun to read as it is informative.  He gives real-world insights (unlike most \\"how-to\\" authors and script teachers, he's a working and produced screenwriter) and offers fantastic tools to help navigate you through the inner workings of writing a screenplay.  Knowing what I've now learned from this book, I am re-tooling one of my past screenplays and writing a new one... and for once I am actually excited about the prospect of finally going from a professional student to a professional writer.
B000002VCO|3.0|As with any AP work, this is one we should have, but my main reason lies in Pipeline and Ammonia Av. This is creative genious working, the rest are good to average pop songs adequate for radio broadcasting.
B000FBGBPC|5.0|Yes!  I have been waiting for a new album from these guys for a long time.  I am excited it is finally here.  That said, I really like it.  A little different sound but not much.  Good lyrics and the guitars are great again.  Very few weak spots on the album. <br /> <br />1. It's All Over- [4.5/5] Great opening track that hits hard.  <br /> <br />2. Pain- [3.5/5] Not a huge fan of this song.  I do not like how his voice sounds during the verses but it is still pretty good. <br /> <br />3. Animal I Have Become- [5/5] I love this song and am glad they chose this as their first single.  Best song on the album.  <br /> <br />4. Never Too Late- [5/5] I also really like this song.  Great vocals and lyrics.   <br /> <br />5. On My Own- [4/5] Pretty good song.  A lot of emotion. <br /> <br />6. Riot- [4/5] Wow! I really love the verses of this song.  It is too bad I do not really like the chorus.  This could have been one of my favorites if the chorus was better. <br /> <br />7. Get Out Alive- [4.5/5] Great song.  Great lyrics.  \\"If you want to get out alive, run for your life\\" is said to mant times but I like the song still. <br /> <br />8. Let It Die- [3/5] My least favorite song on the album.  It is still good but not compared to the rest of the songs on the CD. <br /> <br />9. Over and Over- [4.5/5] Not very hard hitting but is a good song.  I like the lyrics. <br /> <br />10. Time of Dying- [4/5] Again, very great verses but the chorus could have hit harder like the verses. <br /> <br />11. Gone Forever- [4.5/5] Good song and almost great.  Good lyrics. <br /> <br />12. One-X- [5/5] A really great song.  Great way to end the CD.   <br /> <br />Overall, I am happy with the CD and hope Three Days Grace get their second platinum album.
B0007DAZW8|5.0|\\"Human After All\\" is a concept album. The title is \\"Human After All\\", but the music couldn't be more robotic and cold. From my perspective, the album seems to be about a robot who is analyzing humans. What is their function, their purpose, their fascination with technology, their relationship with it, their relationships with one another, etc.<br /><br />The tracks seem to each focus on a specific theme. One moment, it's about robots making music (\\"Robot Rock\\"), the next it's about our fascination with technology and all the things we do to it and it does to us (\\"Television Rules The Nation\\", \\"Technologic\\").<br /><br />Daft Punk releases music only every 4 years or so, and making an album like this made the fans wonder what exactly happened to them. Did they rush release a demo album? Did they loose their minds? The answer is no. They have merely tried to make an artistic statement. Their first album was, as Thomas Bangalter of Daft Punk put it, \\"making something out of nothing\\". The second album was an experiment into the world of emotion, I think, and really was their try at making a more \\"human\\" album. If anything, \\"Human After All\\" is an artistic statement. It may have alienated a few fans, but after giving the album a few listens, the music starts to grow on you. It really feels like a progression, despite the repetitive and cold nature of the album. The tracks seem to have gained popularity over the past year, especially when Daft Punk played a now legendary set at this year's Coachella festival.<br /><br />Perhaps the album will make more sense when Daft Punk release their upcoming film, \\"Electroma\\", which centers on two robots (Bangalter and de Homem-Christo) in their quest to become human. In the meantime, let the album grow on you and you might just \\"get it\\".<br /><br />Key tracks: \\"Human After All\\", \\"The Prime Time Of Your Life\\", \\"Robot Rock\\", \\"The Brainwasher\\", \\"Television Rules The Nation\\", \\"Technologic\\".
B000006MS3|5.0|Oh my goodness....I had this on a vinyl LP back when I was a very young teenager and nearly drove my parents CRAZY with it. I listened to it 3 times a day for about two years....about 700 times or more...when I was 14 and 15.  Now that I listen to it again, I see it was terribly formative for me, a major influence on my life.  I never realized how much the lyrics interweave through my psyche even now, miles away, years later....Buy this and it will change your life.
1881273156|4.0|I think this is a very good perspective and brings up issues that are not normally thought of. I feel that I could fall into any of the catagories depending how I am doing spiritually and emotionally that week.     Another key to this is you must be deeply in love with the other person and be selfless enough to meet a need that is very hard for a person to meet naturally. If I like buying gifts, but my spouse just wants quality time when I an trying to bring home the bacon... we have conflict!    I read \\"Why Singles are not Married & the Married are Single\\". This will make sure you end up with a person for the right reasons and then I think it would be easier to infiltrate the Five Love Languages into a solid relationship.
B00006CXXU|2.0|There were a few songs that I liked on the CD, but the rest were just boring. Oversinging doesn't really impress me; you tend to lose the feeling of a song that way and all you start to hear is a bunch of shouting. Christina needs to develop her own style and come up with some kind of vocal trademark. She has an alright voice but she pretty much sounds like a smorgasbord of various popular female artists. Anyway, I didn't know that Whitney Houston, Mariah Carey, and Alicia Keys were singing back up vocals for Christina. Other than that, most of these songs don't stand out and I would rather listen to a Joss Stone album instead of this again.
B000BM6AVA|1.0|Every song is full of the same, unbelievably bad whiney vocals, accompanying droning, completely amateurish tracks with non-existent melody.  As for lyrics, I'm sure there's some sort of message, if you care to listen through the dismal sessions... One has to ask, is it a message with any value? Some reviewers complain about a consistently trite political agenda throughout songs, yet objections such as this seem moot to me, as a band which subscribes to this kind of non-sensical sound would seem automatically incapable of any worthwhile message.  A complete failure of music, in any case - don't waste your time.

B000AYEL6U|5.0|Thank you BBC!!!!! This beautiful, haunting adaptation of Elizabeth Gaskell's novel is truly moving and unforgettable. As a period drama fan this one is my all-time favorite, in fact it takes period drama to a new level.    A superb ensemble cast, standouts are Sinead Cusack as the stern mother Hannah Thornton, Daniella Denby-Ashe as feisty, passionate Margaret Hale, and Richard Armitage as the stern, troubled and brooding John Thornton is a tour de force, a stunning performance, with tons of chemistry between the two leads.  People have been known to replay the stunning gasp-worthy ending over and over and over - you have been warned - it is  extremely addictive!!    A beautiful score complements the action, it is sad but compelling and one you will want to watch over and over.
0306812835|5.0|I must confess I had a terrible time in the U making my degree in mechanical engineering.. stregth of materials almost made me mad.<br /><br />But as Twain said it, I have not let my schooling interfere with my education... and this are the books that educate.. for education can only be self-education... this is what I was after in the U and I never received it!!!<br /><br />I go futher with this assertion, the progress of the US (and some other advanced nations) above all the rest lies in the fact that popularizations of science and technology are readibly accesible to everyone  (for all of those who want to use it, of course).. if anyone ever doubts the positive effects of globalization and the internet, I can testify that ever since I can use Amazon I can tap into the resources of knowledge previously denied by geographical barriers and help the system that produces this books.<br /><br />Getting back to the book, no matter what your schooling is, if you are into design and need to know about  structures you cannot go wrong with this wonderful book.
B00005QGAZ|5.0|This album came out about 8 years before I was born. All the years, I still remember turning on the classic radio stations that would play WBSS or Billie Jean. Now I know all the lyrics and music videos from this album. This is MJ in his prime. Unfortunately, we will never get another epic like this again. Michael is sadly a target in the media, but he is still a great music icon whether you like him or not. Every song off here is a classic. One song I thought was unneccesary was \\"Baby Be Mine\\". But otherwise, it's excellent. If you starting an MJ collection, get this album first. Trust me.
B000000132|5.0|Those were the days my friends, end of the 70s and here in Venezuela I had a select group of prog listenting friends who shared all the insight on whatever we could lay our hands on to..<br /><br />Renaissance- Annie Haslam's heavenly voice and the group that was able to combine prog with classical.. then life happened and was cut off from this world... Turn of the Cards is one of the finest and you can take it from me that I have not listed to the group in over 20 year
B00013F38K|5.0|I watched this show as a teen and my memories of it are those of a 14-year old. Watching it now, I realize how unique this show was and how lucky the producers were to have an actor with David Carradine's talents in the lead role. Carradine is able, by just changing his expression slightly, to show us boundless joy, total disgust, and plain happiness at being alive. I don't think many actors could do this so well.  No, the martial arts are not as flashy as they would have been with Bruce Lee, but that isn't the point.  Besides, they are OK especially the way the action sequences were filmed. And, just like Bob Seger says about \\"today's music\\"...well, today's TV \\"ain't got the same soul\\".  This show's philosophies are just so much better than most anything else.  Peace, happiness, sharing, kindness...the list goes on and on.  Find THAT in any of today's shows.  I don't think that TV could make this show these days, and that is a real pity.  If Hollywood decides to make a movie out of this series (and it will happen someday), I hope that they manage to keep the innocence and just plain happiness that suffuses the show.  One last note: two of the best parts of this show are Philip Ahn and Keye Luke. Who wouldn't want to study under people like that?

1932907009|5.0|For a new writer, it has been very helpful. The Blake Snyder Beat Sheet forces you to KNOW your movie. And if you don't yet, helps you figure it out. A blank page can be a scary thing. Having your beats down makes it a lot less so. Highly recommended.
B0000073I5|5.0|I had this record at the end of the 70s or early 80s (not sure now).. I never got tired of listening to it.. and always saying how come something so good never came before?? or after for that matter.<br /><br />Sleeve of the record had all the lyrics plus the inspiration of the Album's main theme (Side B dedicated), so in order to understand it and be faithful to the vinyl version start at track 8. This wuld have been side A of the record and contains excellent songs.<br /><br />Side B has to be understood as a whole story:<br /><br />Tired of always doing his 25 years routine at work, Smallcreep takes and adventure at night to visit the factory and find out what is it it made... a true exploration at alienism.. so At the End of the Day he retuns home a changed man and to his loving wife..<br /><br />The album said it was inspired in a book I searched google and found a review that said<br /><br />\\"Side one of the album was inspired by the book 'Small Creep's Day' by Peter Currell Brown, the second side contains a batch of individual songs with no overall concept\\"<br /><br />Its a shame that the book is not available at Amazon US
020161622X|5.0|This is the best book that I have read thus far on the practice of programming. The pragmatic programmer provides invaluable advice to those who are just starting to program,  and those who have been programing for years. By following the authors' simple rules you should have gained some programming wisdom that a programmer would realize in a decade.    There are a couple of things that I think the book has done right:    1) The book is supplemented with code and examples that let the author present the topics better. So it is not just an essay, it is a programming guide    2) There are questions at the end of each chapter that ask you what would you have done in some situation; better yet all the questions have been answered    3) The book has been written and was organized in such a way that you would not need to read the entire book to understand what you want to understand. There is also little cruft    4) The book's key points are listed in the end so you would have the book's wisdom on one page at all times
B00000DC7J|5.0|Im ashamed to say I began listening to Piazzola at my mid thirties... well, better late than never... Im not a music critic, but all I can say is that Tango has a higher dimmension where it becomes universal and mayble the category of jazz (higher jazz that is) is best to classify it.<br /><br />Tango is tragic and sensuous... listening to Piazzolla is like listening to classical music quintent.. at the same level it is..
B00008BXJG|5.0|Well what can I say.Any amount of praise wont be sufficient for this great album.Highway to hell is amongst my favourite albums due to terrific songs like HIGHWAY TO HELL,GIRLS GOT RYTHM,WALK ALL OVER YOU and GET IT HOT.Very highly recommended.
0140277447|5.0|Iris Chang has done the world a tremendous service by carefully documenting the accounts of those who witnessed the slaughter of POW's and noncombatants in China by the Imperial Japanese Army. Her candor and her compassion are remarkable as she recounts the most horrific details. This book is very difficult to endure. Yet it should be essential reading for high school students and soldiers of all nations if for no other reason than its ability to make one painfully aware of the ravages of war.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|WELL WHAT CAN I SAY ABOUT THE BEATLES.THEY ARE THE GREATEST ROCK AND ROLL BAND OF ALL TIME AND DUE TO WHICH MOST OF OTHER ROCK MUSIC STARTED.THIS EXCELLENT VALUE FOR MONEY COMPILATION HAS 27 EXCELLENT SONGS.YOU GOT TO HAVE THIS WITH ALL THEIR OTHER ALBUMS.DIRE STRAITS ONLY MADE GOOD ALBUM,ALL THEIR OTHER ALBUMS SUCK.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|If you've seen Serenity but didn't understand what was going on or didn't care very much for the characters because you didn't really know them or even if you liked the movie the first time, you've GOT to get these DvDs.  They even knocked about $8 off the price from when I bought it about 6 months ago.   <br />Because there are so few episodes, it merely makes each one that much more lovely to see.   <br />They mix equal parts humor, space western, and even a few serious moments.  A favorite episode's hard to pick because they're all decent and most are great.  One I remember offhand is The Message (or something like that:-) where Mal and Zoe get a package from one of their old war buddies.  The music at the end of the episode is just plain heartwrenching yet undeniably beautiful.   <br />The extras are well worth watching as well.  This is hrs and hrs of fine entertainment.

0061020680|4.0|This was my first exposure to Discworld as conceived by Terry Pratchett.  As you know (?), Discworld is THE world, a flat disc-shaped world held on the shoulders of four elephants standing on the carapace of a large turtle traveling through space.<br /><br />The laws of physics behave somewhat improperly near the edge.<br /><br />In Mort, Mort is apprenticed to DEATH.  Mort is very stoic about the experience, and quite a fast learner.  His emotions get in the way of the Balance of Things, however, and the adventure gets more complicated.<br /><br />Terry Pratchett writes in an entertaining style.  Although this is a Young Adult book, I found it witty and engaging.

B000E97Y6K|4.0|well,i missed this movie on theatres.recently i get to watch it on dvd.my god!one of the best movie i have seen in the recent times.and the performances by Jack Black,Adrien Brody...simply wonderful,along with the computer graphics,special effects,peter jackson has recreated the wonderful era.i enjoyed this...a must watch film.highly recommended.
0618477942|5.0|i loved this book so much. <br /> <br />the story is amazing--emotional without being sentimental, and with an uncommon depth.  the narrative construction is brilliant in terms of how it skips around in time but stays anchored in the emotional center of the tale.  the drawings are superb.
B00003JRCQ|5.0|When I showed this film to nine college students in an upper-level literature course two years ago, having raced them through the sumptuous A&E version of Pride and Prejudice, one student voluably objected to the slower pace and humbler scope of this movie's -- and novel's -- approach.  But it is a keeper.  Where are you now, Mr. Hinds, and when will we see more of your performances?  Your Wentworth captures so many nuances.  Ms. Root, as our shy heroine Anne, triumphs along with her dashing companion and seems a conscious casting very reminiscent in appearance to Austen herself.  The two play off one another beautifully.  All the actors do a truly magnificent job.  The settings work well, and the final scene continues to delight with surprise.  We have moved from the fairy-tale ending of Pride and Prejudice to a novel that questions class, possessions, and love in new and subtle ways that come to life in this remarkable, timeless production.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|Shows like Buffy and Angel have always interested me so when i first saw a trailer for Supernatural i new i had to check it out.  I'm glad to say i wasn't disappointed. From the very first episode i became addicted to watching this great show.  Not only is it the right amount of scary but also has the right amount of humour, with great witty one liners.  But what really got me continuing to watch this series week in week out is the great acting and chemistry of the two leads, Jared Padalecki and Jenson Ackles.  I recommend this TV show to anyone who likes scary stories, good humour and great acting.  Not mention two extremely hot leads.  Can't wait for the DVD to come out and for Season 2 to start.
B00005JNRY|4.0|\\"Cars\\" may well be the least of the Pixar animated films put out by Disney, in which case the future of computer animated films remains exceedingly bright.  The story starts with the final race for the Piston Cup, in which rookie Lightning McQueen (voiced by Owen Wilson) is tied with The King (Richard Petty) and bad car Chick Hicks (Michael Keaton) for the lead.  The arrogance of youth costs Lightning the race and the three way tie requires one more race a week later in California for the title and the lucrative endorsement.  But on the way there Lightning get separated from Mack (John Ratzenberger), the big rig in which he travels, and ends up making the mistake of speeding through the town of Radiation Springs.  So instead of preparing for the big race, he is doing community service in a town that has been bypassed by the Interstate and all but forgotten.<br /><br />Radiation Springs, of course, is filled with all sorts of interesting cars.  Lightning is arrested by the Sheriff (Michael Wallis), and sentenced to repair the road by Doc Hudson (Paul Newman in a masterstroke of casting), at the insistence of Sally Careera (Bonnie Hunt), who runs the motel and is also the city attorney.  Mater the tow truck (Larry the Cable Guy) becomes Lightning's new friend and teaches him the joys of midnight tractor tipping, while Luigi (Tony Shalhoub) wants to sell him tires.  There is also Flo (Jenifer Lewis) at the diner, and Sarge the Jeep (Paul Dooley) and Filmore the VW Bus (George Carlin) from the 60s rubbing each other the wrong way.  There is also a tin Lizzie (Kathrine Helmond), who still remembers when the place was founded by Stanley the Steamer.  There are a series of lessons that Lightning needs to learn, and this film goes through all of them right by the numbers.  Things might get a bit predictable, but there is a nice surprise at the end when Lightning puts winning in its proper place, so the little kids are clearly ahead of the game at the end of this one.<br /><br />More than what has come before it this is a Pixar film that speaks to adults, who are in a much better sense to appreciate the sense of loss the film tries to represent with the forgotten city of Radiator Springs (although I have to admit that it reminded me a bit of the abandoned town in the recent remake of \\"House of Wax\\").  This is a move about cars, but it is also once that celebrates the past and the wonders of nature as well as what fast driving machine can do.  Plus, this is a film that has Bonnie Hunt be a Porsche, which is certainly a bit of type casting that only us older folks can appreciate.  Final Note: The name of Lightning McQueen is apparently a reference to Glenn McQueen, a Pixar animator who died in 2002, but it also clearly resonates in terms of Steve McQueen, whose legendary car driving in \\"Bullitt\\" is still well remembered.r /> <br />More than what has come before it this is a Pixar film that speaks to adults, who are in a much better sense to appreciate the sense of loss the film tries to represent with the forgotten city of Radiator Springs (although I have to admit that it reminded me a bit of the abandoned town in the recent remake of \\"House of Wax\\").

B00005JL78|4.0|I had no idea what to expect with this movie.  The premise is cool and that to me is a key to Sci-Fi success: If your interested in the subject matter then the movie has a reasonable chance to be good. <br /> <br />Well, this movie was better than expected and I really got into it at the end when things really came out and the plot unraveled. You could say the the end may have been a little \\"Hollywood-ish\\" but what the heck, it didnt detract from it.  The acting and build up were just fine with some great twists along the way.  Tom Cruise played his part well and didnt get in the way like he usually does. The supporting cast was well portrayed and I enjoyed the tension and environment everyone created. <br /> <br />Some of the future concepts were super-cool and these kind of things are what make us Sci-Fi Geeks happy.  I love seeing what \\"might\\" be in the future and this film had some great stuff like that in it.  The special effects were solid if unspectacular and the sets and scenes were believable enough. <br /> <br />The whole concept of pre-crime and cognitive awareness is freegin' cool and I like how both sides of it were given roughly equal support.  Just like in real-life...what if we could predict crimes prior to them actually happening?  Do we have the right to jail the \\"would-be\\" perpetrators?  What are the legal issues?  Good stuff....good stuff! <br /> <br />I really wanted to give the movie 3 1/2 stars but chose 4 stars. It's pretty solid and you'll probably like it if you're into the genre.  It has some Hollywood moments and the usual \\"dumb\\" henchmen who cant catch anyone to save their lives.  Thats pretty typical though. <br /> <br />I probably wont buy the DVD but it was absolutely worth watching. <br /> <br />Definitely Recommended as a evening's entertainment!
B000F4MLZ8|5.0|I can't stop listening to this CD....seems to be quickly becoming the soundtrack of my life.  I saw Joshua live this past Monday at the Mercury Lounge (which was the second time I have had the pleasure of seeing him in the past two months).  This CD is the next best thing to hearing him perform live.  The band has a cellist and a bass player who are just the right blend with Josh and Priscilla's amazing voices in combination.  And just as an aside, Joshua could not have been nicer or more humble both of the times I met him after his shows.  \\"Will's Song\\" is better every time I listen to it.  \\"Fear You Won't Fall\\" took the words right out of my mouth and is my newest ringtone. Buy this CD!! You will love it.

0895260131|2.0|I have read this book and my stomache turned as the pages turned. It is an attempted assasination of this religion which 1.5 billion people follow. I am not here to debate who has done the most killing: Christian Crusaders or The USA and Israeli Government or al-Qeida and the 9-11 Hijackers. My point is from the standpoint of morality and racial equality and the best way for a man or woman to live and die is better through Islam than any other faith or religion. Take a look at the streets of SanFranciso and compare it to the streets of Saudia Arabia. SF is filled with garbage, filth, pornographic images, transexuals, homosexuals, homeless, drug addicts, criminals, and many frustrated people. Any street in Saudia Arabia will have next to nothing of any of these immoral and hopeless practices. I picked Saudia Arabia because it is a near %100 Muslim country. If all laws are practiced by the correct ways that Islam teaches, not the way the Taliban or other extreme cultures teach it, then the problems of humanity will almost dissapear.      We live in an age where ignorance is the standard way of thinking. Our decision-making is done on impulse, without factual knowledge or critical analysis of what we read or hear. We see a man cut off an innocent mans head screaming \\"Allah Akbar\\" and assume that all Muslims are like this. We take a clip from the news and go to bed believing it is the absolute truth. Instead of taking what this man has written as The Gospel of Islam, read what others say who have studied Islam for years like he has. You wouldn't accept a Muslim's point of view if he wrote a critical book on Christianity so why would you do the opposite? Arrogance and Jealousy will not get you very far. Books like this should be tossed in the garbage because it only produces hatred which will not solve any problems. Take a look at books by Christians who have studied Islam like Karen Armstrong or John Esposito or a Former Christian like Hamza Yusuf or Yusuf Estes who hasa great website called [...]. We dont want to go to our graves having believed lies so I think we owe it to ourselves to seek out the truth.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I can't BELIEVE I waited over six months since the release of this on DVD for the US to own a copy and watch it. My life has been transformed from that of a Mr. Darcy and Pride and Prejudice fanatic to a Richard Armitage/Mr. Thornton/North and South fanatic.<br /><br />Never, and I repeat never, have I seen such a fabulous film. It is so unbelievably romantic, yet deals with social issues in a way that Pride and Prejudice never touches, to completely warm my heart. John  Thornton is a combination of Mr. Darcy, Rhett Butler, Bono and JFK all combined into one fabulously sexy, charismatic and caring man. Kudos to Richard Armitage for being such a great actor, and for knocking Colin Firth off his pedestal as the BBC hearthrob of our times. If you haven't seen this yet, don't make the mistake I did of thinking the DVD cover was boring and thus not worthwhile. It will change your life, the way it changed mine!

B000002JS6|5.0|Well Back in black is my favourite AC/DC album with Brian Johnson.I could keep praising this album without tiring.this fantastic album contains monster hits like Back in black,you shook me all night long and shoot to thrill.Well why are you still reading my review,GO AND BUY THIS CLASSIC NOW.
B000089RV6|5.0|This is and always will be the best album by ac/dc and I would go has far to say the best album released in the 80's followed closely by master of puppets and appetite for destruction. Every song on here is a classic as soon as you hear hells bells you know your in for a treet. High Voltage is my second favorie but this is the best if you don't own this just get it now stop reading this.
B000002J09|5.0|Zoso is one of the best hard rock albums along with Paranoid from Black Sabbath.I really dont care that Black Dog and Stairway to heaven are overplayed, as for me they are great and and anyday better than weepy songs made by boring progressive rock bands like ELP.YOU HAVE TO BUY THIS ALBUM.
0061015725|4.0|Though it gets quite contrived in the end, this was by and large a very fun read.  The part on nanoscience were very well researched, informative and fun to learn about.  The characters were pretty good, too, enjoyed the back and forth tension between the husband and wife.  This was the last of a few books I just read on a vacation but it still kept my attention.  The ending was unsatisfying but overall quite strong.
B000FQJAIW|3.0|...was the original trilogy, unharmed, untampered, in it's original humble glory, with it's original cover artwork, without any 2004 or 1997 or 25th or 30th anniversary editions bundled with it, reminding me of how art loses it's essence when you're drowning in money. <br /> <br />I would not mind this so much if I wouldn't have to pay 60$ for a set which half of it I do not want.
0671027387|5.0|This was a highly entertaining read.  Really enjoyed the characters, yes, a little stereotypical and cliched yet also totally believable, especially the washington dc bureacrats and politicos ...<br /><br />The science here is especially nifty and gives the story great credibility, making it believable.  Loved the foreign landscape of the arctic, too, really took me to a different place I hadn't been before.
B0000073BG|5.0|I would buy this album just for Annie Haslam's last note on the disc.It is one of those rare moments that sends shivers down the spine. For a disc that's hard to fault the only gripe I always had and have is that it is too short. It seems to be over before it began..But for those who wish to discover Renaissance, start here and enjoy.
B000063UR2|4.0|This is a must-have for any fan of the fantasy genre. Of course, if you're really a fan of the fantasy genre, you probably already know that.<br /><br />This edition is a great package. It's really interesting to watch the movie's alternate cut with the classical score, and the bonus features are also a lot of fun. You'll want to watch the making-of documentary and listen to Ridley Scott tell the story of the last-minute makeover which included Tangerine Dream's electronic score. Very interesting story.<br /><br />I don't know which version of the movie I prefer, now. It's good to have them both.
0804102988|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  When I was young, and reading \\"Puck of Pook's Hill\\" and \\"Rewards and Fairies\\" for the first time, I laboriously wrote out a timeline of English history.  It is so hard to place individual happenings and people into perspective with a history so long and eventful.  I think Edward Rutherfurd did an amazing job in telling the story of a beloved place from prehistoric times to modern times through the descendents of five historic families.  A person can look at things from so many perspectives, and the most natural, I suppose, is individual.  That's why some readers prefer a long, detailed story about one character.  But Rutherfurd is writing about a land he loves, and a people.  Our lives are fleeting, just as are the stories of the individual lives in \\"Sarum\\".  But the land, and the spirit of the people that live their lives there, and build buildings, lives on through generations.  I think that is what is being told to us by writers like Rutherfurd, and also Patricia Wright in \\"I am England\\" and \\"That Near and Distant Place\\" and Rudyard Kipling in \\"Puck of Pook's Hill\\" and \\"Rewards and Fairies\\".  The story of the individual is short and sweet, and echoes forward through time.  If we take time and listen carefully, we can hear the voices of our ancestors in the buildings they built, the land they plowed, an inscription in a stone, or a carving.
B000E41MS6|5.0|I writing this really to respond to all of the really bad reviews this series has had, and I have to say it is all wrong. I really had bad images of Doctor Who in my mind, probably due to the late 80s series of bad monsters and bad writing, so I wasn't exactly a great Who fan..until I watched this series. It has to be the best series ever; where else can our main characters go anywhere in space and time, no wonder this show ran and ran in the last century, you can do anything with it.  <br />The acting is great, who'd of thought Billie Piper could act so well, and Christopher Eccleston is a great actor normally, but he excells himself in this series and how can you criticis the monsters; the Sliveen, he Jagrofess, the Gelf and everyones favorates; the Daleks.  <br />The thing about Doctor Who is that is has a unique approch to science-fiction, that is is very VERY British, probably why it hasn't done that well in America, and I think that people who don't get this series have been influenced too much by American Sci-fi such as Buffy (which don't get me wrong is very good), but it's diffrent.  <br />This series is fantastic and I advice anyone who has just discovered it to watch it again and again, it is truly; as the Ninth Doctor would say 'fantastic'!
B0007M22TI|4.0|Technically, this isn't virtuoso musicianship but the talent-level is extremely high. It's a pleasant, sweet, memorable plethora of charming, evocative, and sentimental songs in artful harmonic arrangements presented by a team of talented and extremely attractive female vocalists in beautiful gowns on a cool stage in a fascinating light show.<br /><br />If there were any drawback it might be the somewhat static nature of the presentation. It reinforces the ethereal nature of the uniformly angelic-sounding harmonies but is visually stiff at times.<br /><br />Yes, the tracks are layered, the video heavily edited, and there's some post-production vocal tinkering. But that's standard for any concert video. You can say the same things about any movie or TV show you watch. Almost any dialogue that takes place outdoors on your favorite cop show, for instance, has been re-recorded in the studio by the actors so that you can hear it more clearly. Does that make it \\"fake\\"?<br /><br />This program is perfect to chill out to and - certainly - look at. That's what they were shooting for. They hit it.
B000002542|5.0|Wow!  Was I blown away by this CD! <br /> <br />I've been a Journey fan for over twenty years now.  I knew there were three pre-Steve Perry albums from the '70's, but I'd never heard any material.  Let's face it; they don't play this stuff on FM radio and they never will!  I actually first heard some of it when Journey toured last summer, spanning their entire 30-year career from the beginning. <br /> <br />This debut CD from 1975 is full of raw, hard-core rock, with that classic 70's edge.  Some fans have argued that it almost takes on a heavy metal quality, and they're not entirely wrong.  The music is NOT for the Steve Perry/Journey fan, but rather for the fans of the first three Santana albums featuring Gregg Rollie on vocals. <br /> <br />Journey fans...go back to the very beginning and rediscover the legendary band's roots!

B000EWBNMS|4.0|An exceptional series in a drab year \\"Medium\\" picks up the slack for the cancelled \\"Tru Calling\\".  Emmy winner Patricia Arquette plays Allison DuBois who is studying for her law degree and interning at the D.A.'s office in Arizona. She has scary dreams. Many times these dreams come true or she'll see people long dead that she's never met and they'll tell her something about upcoming events or pass along a message. She suspects that she might have psychic powers. Her husband Joe suggests that she sent along info to authorities on an unsolved murder or mystery and if it turns out to be helpful, well she does have psychic powers but her husband says he suspects they're just dreams. They're not. She is contacted by the Texas Rangers and a Captain (Arliss Howard)who is trying to solve a missing person/murder involving a child flies her to Texas to help. He has his doubts until she discloses something personal about himself that he never told anyone.<br /><br />But then you knew all that didn't you? You saw it in a dream or at the very least on CBS.<br /><br />\\"Medium\\" is a terrific show whether you're a believe in this stuff or not. It's well written and suspenseful with exceptional performances. The DVD set has the first 17 episodes of the show plus an extended version of the pilot that never aired. Aside from the extended version of the pilot (which appears on the first disc) all of the other extras appear on the last disc.<br /><br />We get two nearly ½ hour featurettes that focuses on the creation of the show and changes that occurred prior to the show getting the green light for shooting the pilot and the series itself. \\"The Making of Medium\\" features interviews with executive producers Kelsey Grammer (hopefully he'll make a number of guest star turns in the show), Caron, Steve Stark, Ron Schwary and production members such as Ken Kelsch (cinematography who discussed the moody work he contributes to the show), Allison Dubois, actors Arquette (who by the way one a much deserved Emmy for her performance this year for the second season), Jake Weber (who plays her husband Joe), Sandoval and others.<br /><br />\\"The Story of Medium\\" continues with interviews of the usual suspects mentioned above plus input from some of the writers on the show discussing how events involving real medium were crafted to fit the concept of the show. It's a fascinating glimpse into the creative process of creating and writing episodic TV shows.<br /><br />We also get a pair of shorter featurettes that deal with Allison Dubois both real and as imagined in the show. The first \\"The Real Allison Dubois\\" gives us a portrait of the lady that inspired the show. Ms. Dubois is a natural on camera and it's clear why Caron used this lady as inspiration for his show. She's also a consultant on the show as well. \\"Interpreting Allison Dubois\\" features Arquette and she discusses the challenges of playing a real person in a fictional setting, the qualities she tries to capture of the real Dubois as well as her take on the character vs. the real person.<br /><br />We also get a humorous gag reel  and some of the TV advertising for the show. It's clear that NBC knew they had a winner on their hands and they gave the show their all in promotional activity (which this spooky winner deserved). We also get deleted scenes for 7 episodes some of which have multiple scenes that were cut for time constraints. Since this is a short TV season (only 17 episodes) I would also like to have seen some previews for the second season (which I haven't watched) and the forthcoming third as long as they are without spoilers. I also would have liked to see commentary tracks from Arquette, Weber and some of the main cast. Perhaps we'll see that on the second season set which is already scheduled for later this year on DVD.<br /><br /> We also get four audio commentaries on four episodes two with creator/writer/director/producer Glenn Gordon Caron one done in collaboration with producer MoiraKirkland and the other with executive producer Rene Echevarria (\\"The 4400\\", \\"Star Trek: The Next Generation\\"). The best of the audio commentaries are the two with Glen Gordon Caron although guest star Chad Lowe deserves a special mention for making the most of his commentary track. It's a fun listen.<br /><br />I predict you'll buy this great package and show. But then I didn't need an special abilities to see that. You're visiting this page after all aren't you? Enjoy the show! I'd give \\"Medium\\" a 9 out of 10 and highly recommend this great show.

B000FS9FC6|5.0|The movie to me means that the time Guy fawkes tried to put enough gunpowder underneath our parliment to make one big bang. And although the film can be enjoyed by all, the movie is probably aimed more to british people like myself for knowing the history, even though saying this, I hope it give overseas a chance to read more about british history. So the ending has a huge meaning! I have read some comments saying it's empty/pointless LOL - it's not.
B000AARKOO|4.0|I understand some people's dislike of this film and respect that it doesn't strike a chord with them.  However, even as an ardent conservative, I can't agree with the reviewers that say this is a liberal leaning, anti-Christian movie.  Did you miss the entire point? The Kingdom that Christ desires is in our hearts and minds and not one made out of walls and land.  So many of the crusaders lost track of that ideal and became greedy and murderous rather than loving and God fearing.  Yes, the film failed to tell of Muslim atrocities during that period, but the main idea wasn't to make anyone look bad.  The theme was redemption, honor and purity of the heart and as such pointing out everything bad about another culture wasn't necessary.  It wouldn't have been right to only emphasize the wholesome characteristics of the Europeans because that isn't historically accurate either.  Terrible things were done in the name of religion on both sides, and frankly still are.  Orlando Bloom's character trascended the greed and fought for his oath.  I cringe when I see any religion mocked in the media and I'm particularly sensitive when my own faith is ridiculed, but I don't see that happening here.  I fell in love with this movie partly because of the contrast of one faithful man doing what is right against the back drop of his own people acting viciously out of selfish ambition.  In this way this movie is very personal to me.  For the record, the director's cut is substantially longer and makes better use of the characters.  The four disc version has a multitude of extras, but a lot of the bonus stuff on the 2 disc version [quality documentary material] does not appear in the newer package so it is wise to hang on to the previous version as well.  There is a particularly good piece on mideivel castles on the original 2 disc version that is well worth watching, but it doesn't seem to be on the Director's cut.

B000005RY7|4.0|Collectors and even the casual KISS fans probably already have all the tracks here except for the new ones.  So those songs are the reason to buy or not buy this CD.  I had this album on cassette for many years and was rather happy with it.  Of the previously-released KISS songs on it, the selection is as decent a hits compilation as any other I would have chosen for myself.  The new songs range from okay to pretty good (my fave being \\"Nowhere To Run\\") and make interesting additions to a collector's KISS catalog.  If any of those songs had been released on a 1978-1983 era KISS album they would have sounded fine mixed in with the rest of the batch.  But because they are singled out as \\"newly recorded tracks\\" some reticent fans will deride them for not having that \\"classic KISS\\" sound.  Whatever.  I buy KISS records because I like KISS and I don't moan and whine about the ones that don't strike my fancy as much as other songs might.<br /><br />The newer songs are decent enough and the CD itself is rare enough that it merits purchasing as a collector's item.  KISS doesn't re-invent the wheel with the new songs, but they've written enough great stuff to sustain a fan base for decades and decades so they more than earn their keep.<br /><br />Nobody likes EVERY song by their favorite band, do they?

B0000TLA9G|3.0|Guns N' Roses is my favorite band, but this greatest hits collection doesn't satisfy the fans.  For newbies, this is a great pickup; the most recognizable songs from Appetite For Destruction and the Use Your Illusion albums are on here, and are among the gunner's finest moments.  However, the 5 covers are really unnecessary.  The covers of live and let die and knocking on heaven's door are decent, but are really overblown.  The originals were far better than the covers. <br />  The last three songs are covers, and really should have been left off.  However, the nine originals are all bonafide hits and true GN'R classics.   <br /> <br />While this greatest hits collection does have their most recognizable songs, I recommend getting their debut, Appetite For Destruction, the greatest rock album of all time.
B00004ROM2|4.0|This is without a doubt, one of Bill Murray's best films. It is both a fantasy and a comedy flick. The basic premise of the film is simple. A man is forced to relive the same twenty four hours, over, and over, and over again, ad infinitum.<br /><br />Bill Murray is that man. An obnoxious Pittsburgh weatherman, he is in Punxutawney, Pennsylvania to cover its Groundhog Day celebration, along with his beautiful and altruistic TV producer, played by Andie MacDowell, and his patient, long suffering cameraman, played by Chris Elliot. Murray, playing an uncaring, unfeeling wretch of a guy, is, for some inexplicable reason, forced to relive the same twenty four hours in Punxutawney over and over again. Why? Who knows and who cares? What follows next are some of the funniest moments in film.<br /><br />At first, Murray is confused. No one else, however, seems to be. As Murray continues to relive the same day, confusion turns to anger. Ultimately, that anger turns to mischieviousness and indulgence. After all, what would one do, if there were no consequences to one's actions?<br /><br />This premise provides for quite a few, very funny scenes. This puckish foray quickly denigrates into profound despair, as Murray realizes that he seems destined to relive the same day forever. Frequent, subsequent suicide attempts fail to stop the clock, and Murray rethinks his position. He concentrates , finally, on becoming the best man that he can be, with the lovely Andie MacDowell as his romantic interest.<br /><br />Murray's transition from smarm to charm provides for many hilarious scenes that will leave the viewer howling with laughter. The ultimate impact of his transition from Neanderthal man to Renaissance man is, needless to say, a positive one. This redemption will ultimately prove to be be Murray's salvation.<br /><br />Murray provides droll, comedic delivery, and he is perfect in this role. Andie MacDowell is the perfect straight man and comedic foil. Together they make this movie one that the viewer will want to see again and again.ie one that the viewer will want to see again and again.
B000E6UK5K|1.0|I have listened to Pink Floyd probably once a week since 1974. It is in my will they will play DArk side of the Moon at my wake! I cry at times I am so overwhelmed with the music. This album makes me cry for a different reason. It has no life, its old, its boring, its repitious. I feel old having to listen to this. It has no heart, no juice. I literally cant listen to more than 1/2 a song before I change to another CD. The David Gilmour Live Concert DVD. I guess its his and Pink Floyds final hurrah! <br /> <br />
6301744160|2.0|Very odd and original movie about shrinking people to microscopic size and injecting them into a man's body to allow them to do laser surgery in his brain and save his life.<br /><br />They gave some special reason why his life was so important to save, something about national security, but that was irrelevant to the movie.  It was so irrelevant that the movie never bothered to tell us whether the man was saved, and nobody cared.  He was just an excuse to make a movie about traveling inside the human body.<br /><br />So we get to see red blood cells floating in liquid.  We get to see the inside of the man's ear.  This and that.  Actually a fairly dopy movie.<br /><br />They even gave us a bad guy.  One of the micronauts is a saboteur.<br /><br />The movie fails to give me the feeling that it takes place inside a human body.  The plot fails to grab me.  But it's a novel idea anyway.  If a college kid put it together I'd say the kid did a fairly interesting job for a college project.
B000E1YVZU|4.0|I agree with Ruth Leaonard in my distaste for a previous post. <br /> <br />According to T. Nakajima, no one should watch Oklahoma, Sound of Music, Phantom of the Opera, or any other past musical because people don't live like that anymore, so we can't relate to farming, Nazis, or anything else because we're past that time period.   <br /> <br />Duh! First of all this isn't a documentary.  Second, the movie even posts the year in the opening scene just to give the audience a reference of the time period.  Alphabet City may be posh now, but it wasn't then. <br /> <br />Anyways, as a faithful follower to the original musical, this movie was a breath of fresh air.  I most definitely recommend this to anyone, but also recommend that you buy the original cast recording to compliment your Rent experience. :-) <br /> <br />Pros: <br />-The new arrangements give the classic songs a more \\"complete\\" sound.  \\"Take Me or Leave Me\\" is probably the biggest (and best) change. <br />-The visuals make the stage version come alive. <br />-The original cast was kept intact (save for Mimi who was pregnant at the time and Joanne who felt she was too old for the part). <br /> <br />Cons: (compared to the original) <br />-The story changed in some instances. <br />-The songs are less connected by their common sounds/instruments.  While I like the songs individually, the musical continuity is a bit more subdued due to the arrangements. <br />-Maureen's opening scene (her performance) was just a big \\"Yikes!\\" in my book.  Instead of her belting all the lines and introducing herself to the audience, she makes it seem like it's a quirky grade school performance. <br /> <br />Neutral: <br />-The connecting/chorus songs are gone and replaced by speaking lines instead.  Sometimes this works, but other times, you can tell the actors just really want to sing the line.  This also takes away from the musical feel.  So it's bittersweet I guess. <br />-Also, the voices of all the actors are more homogeneous sounding, whereas in the musical, each voice is quite distinct.  <br /> <br />
B000F3TBIO|5.0|This album is supposed to be Patton's version of pop & what he feels should be on the radio.  Well compared to the stuff you hear on the radio, this material wouldn't even come close.  I would be surprised to hear any of these tracks on the radio any where in the states except for maybe some college radio stations. <br />If I attempted to play this to my radioslave friends thinking that they would be able to enjoy it or have the attention span for it because it Patton's most accesible work since Faith No More, I would be sadly mistaken.  It's more accessible than the most of his recent projects, but doesn't even come close to FnM's accessibility.  FnM is a whole different animal.  <br />Mr. Bungle's first album actually is more accessible to me than Peeping Tom as a whole.  So let's not kid ourselves...no, even better, lets stop insulting this music by calling it \\"pop.\\"   <br />The Peeping Tom album is a great album that only shows few signs of accessibility from time to time & THAT'S A GOOD THING!  The music on this entire album is very original.  There's nothing out there that sounds like it & I'm so glad there's still a few artists out there like Patton. <br />The music industry should promote & recognize artists for their originality & having talent above & beyond the average musician. <br />In this day in age, they don't.  The back up puppets who can push merchandise, can do a decent dance choreography, & image than the music itself.  Patton represents the complete counter culture to that & good for him. <br />This cd is worth every penny.
B000EMGAOY|3.0|I have read multiple reviews on this site basically bowing down to this record.  I can guarantee those people who think this is a masterpiece are either big fans of previous work and can't face the fact that their favorite band didn't put out brilliant work, or they simply don't listen to a lot of music.  When Dani California is played against songs like \\"Bad Day\\", \\"You're Beautiful\\", and \\"Ridin\\", of course it's going to sound great.  But, when this record is played up against other good albums from this year, it's really nothing better than a solid album.

0385474547|4.0|When you first look at this story it will look like one that you have read before.  The Africans have a reasonably civilized society that has been in place for more years than anyone can remember. It is a very static, subsistent one but there are many traditions and the people seem to live happily. <br /> <br />True, the men rule and the women and children are almost like chatal, but there is also a freedom and respect among the sexes.  Once again colonialism raises its' ugly head.  What makes this story interesting is the view of how Christianization takes place.   <br /> <br />Originally, the man who comes to the village to evangelize the natives (for the Anglican church) is a wise man and understands that people need to have their traditions respected.  Not all are but mostly the change is slow and the leaders of the village are given time to get used to the changes. <br /> <br />As always, the next man is a fire breather and he disrupts everything.  He treats people like animals.  Leaders are disrespected and the most disreputable men are given power as long as they cow-tow to the party line.   <br /> <br />In the end, we all know the ending, the Colonial government will win; because of superior firepower and the use of native traitors, who are worse than their bosses.  But the people are shown to have strength and not just give in as is the case in most Euro-Centric written histories.
0563486430|4.0|While I wouldn't wax poetic about the writing, I can say that this was a fairly fun and entertaining read (especially for those in need of a Doctor fix between seasons).  I found myself wanting a bit more interaction between Rose and the Doctor - Rayner writes their chemistry quite well, but unfortunately doesn't indulge us as often as I'd like.  Still, there are some good moments between the pair.  While part of the plot is completely predictable, there is an interesting twist worked into the end.  If you want brain candy (as I did) this is the way to go.
B000055ZB8|4.0|The grand-daddy of all vampire movies - there may be earlier ones, but Murnau's 1922 NOSFERATU is the one we all remember - is still pretty effective.  Count Orlok (Max Schreck) wants to buy a house in Bremen, the naïve and ambitious real estate agent Hutter travels to his gloomy castle to do the deal.  While there Hutter spills a little blood (those red marks on his neck aren't, as he believes, from the pesky mosquitoes) and, worse, he drops a cameo portrait of his `pure' wife Ellen (`nice neck') under the, er, robust nose of the contract-signing Count.<br /><br /> If you've seen any vampire movie made since then, and there are thousands of them, you can pretty much connect the dots from the set-up to the end. NOSFERATU is the least frightening, yet most disturbing, movie I've seen.  Set against deserted and barren landscapes of cragged castles and enveloping arches, populated by characters who flow from one extreme pose to another, shadowed by Freudian debris from the blistered imagination of Bram Stoker, framed and focused through the Expressionist lens of German director F.W. Murnau, NOSFERATU is a filmed nightmare.  By today's standards the acting is broadly melodramatic and resoundingly bad, ham upon ham.  Orlok, the Dracula character, is a taloned and pointy-toothed grotesque.  Poor Hutter is a bouncing halfwit. Nobody and nothing reflects reality in this picture, at least waking reality.<br /><br /> To be honest, NOSFERATU didn't begin to work on me right away.  I saw it years ago on a bad vhs tape and wasn't very impressed.  The Image print is clean, has many delicately tinted sequences (original, I believe) and a good commentary track.  Still, after the first viewing I had something close to my original reaction.  I watched it a couple other times after that, once with the commentary track, and found the acting increasingly less distracting and the images more insinuating and disturbing.  It's certainly a movie that grows with each viewing.  Highly recommended.recommended.    <br />
B000AP04OM|5.0|Jubilant, heartbreaking and ultimately uplifting to the spirit, this film demonstrates and is a tribute to all the goodness there is in the world and what life has to offer and what we can strive for. I saw this film when I was a little boy and well it was good I suppose but it has grown to mean much more to me with each passing year. There is goodness and love and tragedy in the world as I have now come to realize but when your spirits are low you can return to this film and remember and savor the lessons you have learned and reflect back and see parallels in the images that you once never truly saw. For a film that is greatness I suppose. Someone recently reintroduced me to this film and it has taken on a whole new meaning for me. Happiness is where you find it and make it. The one character that left an indelible image with me was Rolfe (Daniel Truhitte). Captain Von Trappe (Christopher Plummer) implores him to \\"Come with us.\\" Rolfe had his chance to live life as a human being but he chose otherwise and in doing so gave up his chance for happiness. As a viewer, choose happiness and indulge yourself in this film. You will truly take away something of value each time you view it.<br /><br />Such great talents are associated with this film. The prolific Robert Wise once again demonstrated his vast array of directorial talents (THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL, EXECUTIVE SUITE, THE HAUNTING, WEST SIDE STORY, ODDS AGAINST TOMORROW, RUN SILENT, RUN DEEP) being able to produce yet another gem regardless of the genre. That is a rare thing and Wise certainly seemed like the man for that job on this film given his gentle demeanor and eye for good storytelling. Screenwriter Ernest Lehman is another prolific talent with screenplays for EXECUTIVE SUITE, SABRINA, NORTH BY NORTHWEST and THE KING AND I to his name. Production Designer Boris Leven also was another prolific fellow with production designs such as GIANT, JOHN PAUL JONES and WEST SIDE STORY to his name. The entire cast is excellent. Julie Andrew's naïve yet intuitive qualities as Maria matched against the outwardly stern and overtly proud Christopher Plummer as Captain Von Trappe, who's personalities must eventually come together in order for them to become life loved partners is brilliantly performed by these two. Particular note should be made to Richard Hayden's performance as Max Detweiler Von Trappe's friend otherwise talent agent who acts as the liaison with the audience with his wry visual expressions.<br /><br />I found the DVD extras of this edition to be quite enjoying, memorable and rewarding. The sentimental discussion between Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer gave a lot of insight to what was happening on the set and in particular gave Plummer's candid feelings about being upstaged by children and insight how he viewed the handling of his professional career at that point in time. Plummer was really an actor caught in the death throws of what the Hollywood system had previously established for stardom and he seems to have been affected by that obsolete criteria that really was no longer in effect. The DVD also brought together the entire Von Trappe children's cast and it was good to hear their vignettes and recollections of their experiences.

B00008EY9G|4.0|My wife and I saw this movie on its opening weekend and both of us were blown away by the storyline and the acting.  We've been Cusak fans for quite awhile (me since \\"Say Anything\\") and I have always loved Ray Liotta.   <br />The whole movie had this eerie, creepy feeling about it.  The story does hold it's own, though it does \\"borrow\\" from two masters of mystery; Ms Agatha Christie and Sir Alfred Hitchcock.  Once the \\"twist\\" comes in, even my wife (who figured out the ending to \\"American Haunting\\", \\"Silent Hill\\", \\"The Others\\") said \\"OH MY!\\" and we both bought the movie a couple days after it came out on DVD. <br />The reason for the 4 star rating was that the \\"Extended Alternative Ending\\" added about 3 seconds-if that-to the trip in the van.   <br />SPOILER: I didn't really understand the basis behind most of the victims relation to each other, mainly the birthdates and the states their last names represented; but after watching it a couple times, it dawned on me.  What easier way to make up identities for multiple personalities than to have similar dates of birth or names one can recognize (names of states). <br /> <br />I do appreciate Cusak's roles nowadays, but I think he's being too typecast as a romcom star.  Come over to Drama, Jon!  It's a lot easier to win an Oscar or Golden Globe when you star next to Newman, Hanks, and are directed by Spielberg and Howard.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|A friend of mine *insisted* that there was no reason for me to even rent North & South...I needed to buy it.  I finally decided to go for it, and I have a new favorite on my shelf!<br /><br />North & South, like many BBC dramas, is beautifully shot, with incredible acting from all the leads (don't miss the opportunity to see the incredible Richard Armitage).  What sets it apart however, is the story, which has great depth, lots of romantic tension, and incredibly memorable characters.<br /><br />Like a lot of the reviewers here, the BBC's production of \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is a favorite of mine.  I can honestly say that \\"North & South\\" is on par with P & P.  Dont' hesitate to give it a try.
B00004Y6NX|5.0|What is it with these 1 star reviewers? HUH!!!! THIS ALBUM IS FANTASTIC WITH GREAT SONGS LIKE TUNNEL OF LOVE AND EXPRESSO LOVE. <br />SURE IT'S NOT AS GREAT AS LOVE OVER GOLD BUT IT'S GOOD. I HATE <br />THE ROLLING STONES, THESE GUYS ARE NEVER OVERRATED!!!! THIS ALBUM <br />IS LOVE SO PLEASE RATE THIS A 5 STAR. I HATE BROTHERS IN ARMS AND THE DEBUT IS OVERRATED!!!!!!! BEATLES STONES WHO ZEPPELIN, AC/DC AND FLOYD ARE OVERRATED SO LIKE THIS. <br />THANK YOU.
6305511055|2.0|The many toubled, undemocratic areas of Africa don't have leaders that have sworn to stop at nothing until the United States is destroyed.  Whether or not he actually had the capability to do so, the leader of Iraq did so swear and he did lead the world to believe that he had such capability.  But thanks for commenting. <br /> <br />As for the film, I know it won a couple Oscars and all, but I just didn't like it.  I thought the editing was poor, that the scenes were long and often unnecessary.  Although the story was good, a modern director would have put it together a lot better.
B0000TLA9G|5.0|Hey kid look!! Guns N' Roses Greatest Hits, one of the greatest albums in history and will always be. <br /> <br />Guns N' Roses are one of my favourite and greatest hard rock bands of all time. They rock, and are brilliant. They made some <br />of their greatest songs in Sweet Child of mine, November Rain, <br />Civil War, and Dust and Bones. Buy this now. They are gods just <br />like Dire Straits. And one more thing, avoid Led Zeppelin, Pink <br />Floyd, Rolling Stones, Beatles, and Who. GNR ARE THE BEST!!!!!!
B000AP04FG|4.0|It's one of Hollywood's freakier genetic experiments: inserting genes from a domestic comedy into the DNA of an action thriller. The real surprise is that the result is not only viable, but lively and enjoyable. The action sequences keep it moving, but the humor of the over-familiar couple is what makes this really worthwhile. Anyone who's been coupled for more than a few years will recognize all the signs: affectionate gestures so habitual they're almost invisible, not-quite-listening to most of what's said, and the daily routine (or rut).<br /><br />And the little secrets we keep from each other. There's no ill intent there, just things we don't want our other to worry about, or things that would be harder to discuss than they're worth. Like, for example, the little thing about international assassinations for hire.<br /><br />There are no grand themes here. It's just entertainment - lots of action, and enough wit to keep you paying attention. If you just want to kill a few hours, Mr. and Mrs. Smith are the ones to do the job for you.<br /><br />//wiredweird
B00004Y6NW|1.0|I can't imagine anyone hating all the other Dire Straits albums. <br />They are terrific, and this one you like and Brothers in Arms are <br />OVERRATED!!!!!!!! Water of Love, In The Gallery, and Wild West End are dumb and are just for BABIES....This album only has 1 good song in Sultans of Swing, rest BORING. GET MAKING MOVIES <br />LOVE OVER GOLD, AND ON EVERY STREET INSTED. 1 STAR.............. <br />
B000F7CMRM|1.0|This is the most hyped and overrated movie of the last several years. The filmmakers spend more time trying to justify how important and relevant this movie should be than actually telling a story. It tries to answer many questions, but the questions are never clear and in the end we don't really care what the point; if any, is supposed to be. The result; a two hour wreck that doesn't go anywhere.  <br /> <br />Difficult to believe that the people behind the excellent \\"Traffic\\" are responsible for this turkey. Clooney is not that good of an actor and actually he has been better in many other films. The fact that he won an Academy Award for this one is unbelievable. <br /> <br />Summarizing, get \\"Traffic\\" instead. If you have already seen \\"traffic\\" watch it again.  <br />
B000FBGBPC|5.0|This is an awesome album! I (for once) got it the day it came out! I was very much so looking forward to it. I had a countdown on my calendar for it. It definitely shows a lot of growth for the band, both musically and lyrically. Adam's vocals are definitely better, and the instrumentals are notch up. The album also has a much better grip on dynamic contrast. They differentiate between soft and loud a lot more, and I think that's really awesome! It's also a bit louder of an album. Here is my track by track review:  1. It's All Over: 5/5 stars - This is a great track for the album to start out with. Like their debut they started out with a relatively loud song as the first track, and I must say it was a great decision! While not one of my absolute favorites, I still love this song. It has a great guitar solo in it, which is rare for Three Days Grace. They tend to not have a lot of them.  2. Pain: 5/5 stars - This has been said to be the 2nd single, and it's a definitely a good choice! It's a loud song with a catchy chorus! It also shows great dynamic contrast between the verses (soft) and chorus (loud)! I also love the bridge. It's one of my favorite tracks!  3. Animal I Have Become: 5/5 stars - Being the 1st single, it was my first taste of the new album, and I can honestly say it blew me away! It's definitely a good song. The video for it was very well done and was very cool. I will skip this, simply because I've heard it a lot, due to it being a single. I do however, still love this song, and I can't get tired of it! It was a great choice for a single!  4. Never Too Late: 5/5 stars - This is my favorite song on the album! The first time I heard this I cried. I can definitely relate to it! It really hit home with me. I've known a couple of people who have either threatened to commit suicide or who have tried, and I think that this song is a really good message to them: It's never too late. It also has a good contrast between soft and loud, showing the growth in dynamic contrast. I would love to see this become a single!  5. On My Own: 4/5 stars - This is not one of my favorite tracks, and it's actually one of my least favorites. It's still very good, however.  6. Riot: 5/5 stars - One of my favorites! I really love this song. It's definitely the loudest on the album, and it would make a killer single. It would also probably be amazing live! I also love Adam's voice in this near the end where his voice gets kind of scratchy/growly. I love it!  7. Get Out Alive: 5/5 stars - When I first heard this, it wasn't one of my favorite tracks. However, it is quickly growing on me! It also shows a lot of dynamic contrast!  8. Let It Die: 5/5 stars - This was also a song that I wasn't as fond of when I first heard it, but it is quickly growing on me! It's got good dynamic contrast! It's also rather catchy!  9. Over and Over: 5/5 stars - This is not one of my favorites, however it is still an awesome track! The beginning is very awesome! It is one of the best songs for dynamic contrast! It's definitely a good song, and it's also very catchy!  10. Time of Dying: 4/5 stars - This isn't one of my favorites, but it's still an awesome song! It's probably one of my least favorites, but it's still listenable!  11. Gone Forever: 4/5 stars - This is another song that isn't one of my favorites, but it's still awesome and listenable!  12. One X: 5/5 stars - I love this song! I've had so many times where I felt completely alone and felt like I didn't exist... So I could really relate! It has a very anthemic feel, and it's a great closer!    That's all folks, until the next album, then I'll be back!
B00005LC1H|5.0|I have watched this several times and I still laugh out loud every time. \\"Fawlty Towers\\" is one of the best British comedy shows ever made. My only complain is that only a handful of episodes were ever made. <br /> <br />I don't buy TV shows on DVD and I never recommend anybody to do so; but this is the exception to the rule.   <br />
B0002EQ7EC|5.0|I really think it's Simon's best.  This, and perhaps (in a very different style) \\"Paul Simon.\\"  I'm just listening to it again after several years...the melodies are intricate, the words are vivid and allusive, the range is astounding.  Graceland has a wonderful rock-style going on, but I really think this is my favorite.  I know a lot of non-Simon fans who love this one album.  It's just fantastic.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This was one of those shows that only come by every so many years. Great science fiction and outstanding TV. Perfect for all SF lovers that wanted anything other than Star Trek and the awful shows that the SF Channel produces. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, nobody was watching and it got cancelled. Thank God for DVD, get this one and enjoy every minute of it. <br />
B0002IVN9W|4.0|What is it about Canada these days? Especially Montreal. Some of the best indie pop post rock whatchamacallit seems to be comming out of the Great White North and Arcade Fire are among the best of them. Funeral is not an album that will grab you immediately, at least it didn't grab me. I had to play it a few times for it to really sink in and that's usually the sign of an album that I'm going to play for a long time. So what do you call this? The Amazon review called this chamber pop and that seems a reasonable moniker. I could name all the influences, pop rock and folk: they sound like blah blah, mixed with a dollop of blah blah, but really they don't sound like anybody else. In other words the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. Cliche I know, but fitting. Theirs is an intricate sound, with lots of tonal colors (violin, drums, guitars - electric and acoustic, accordian, etc), musical twists and dynamics that add up to some emotionally complex and rewarding music. I dare you to listen to Wake Up and not be moved. The music isn't about chops, but about the writing. And the writing is good. Win Butler's voice may take some getting used to being a bit like fellow Canadian Neil Young's and the recording isn't the best, but Funeral is the sound of a band really going for it and making something grand in the process.
B000FQJAIW|2.0|I love the original Star Wars movies.  I owned them on the original VHS release.  When Lucasfilms released the trilogy on VHS in the `special' THX format I was more than happy to oblige, and bought the entire trilogy.  Then came the special extended versions of the movies-great!  I saw those in theaters and rushed to buy them when they came out on VHS.  I missed the Laserdisc version and didn't buy anything else on VHS, but then came the DVD release of the trilogy (the extended versions of the film).  Hey, I thought, I already own these movies in 3, yes 3, versions.  But what the heck-Lucas and co. are saying they'll never release the original versions of the film on DVD anyway, so why not make it 4? <br /> <br /> Now we're looking at yet another release of the films.  This is promised to be a \\"Limited Edition,\\" which probably means it will only be out until demand subsides and they can release another version.  If this were a new Dolby or Hi Def release of the original movies I may consider them, but its not.  It's a rehashed release of the Laserdisc version of the films from 13 or so years ago, hideously outdated and ignorant of the technological advantages of DVD.  I'm not going to bite on this release-I've had enough for the time being. <br />   <br /> When (and to me it's a question of when, not if) Lucas finally decides to put forth a bit of effort and release Episodes IV-VI in a format that's not 15 years outdated I'll buy, though by this point I feel I shouldn't.  But I see no reason to buy this release.  Before the first DVD version came out Lucas said he wouldn't release the original films on DVD until after Episode 3-that turned out to be a lie.  Then he said he'd never release the original theatricals on DVD-that, too has proved untrue.  I'm fairly certain that we'll get a new version of the theatrical releases soon, maybe one that will be worth owning.  Until then I can be patient-Lucas is apparently so willing to bleed his die-hard fans dry that the only true \\"definitive\\" release of the films will be the one Lucas does right before he, himself, passes on.  Only then will these poor, tired classics get a rest.

B000301YY8|5.0|I first heard of James Blunt with his \\"Beautiful\\" song. I liked it on the radio, so I decided to buy the cd. I absolutely love every song on the cd. I have it in my car and when I go to change my 6 cds, I never switch this one out. I don't have to skip any songs because they all sound great to me. I like the falsetto sound. I've read some of the other reviews and some don't like his voice or some think he copies other guitar riffs. I don't know about all of that, I just know that when I'm driving down the road, I get lost in his music.  I did not have to get used to his sound, he had me from the first song. I also enjoy listening to Maroon 5 and Kelly Clarkson's new cd. I only tell you this because if you like Maroon 5, I think you'd like Jame's cd.
B00005JOFQ|4.0|I watched Brokeback Mountain with Natasha my girlfriend last night. She had already seen it in the cinema when it came out, and ordered it as soon as it was available on DVD. It is a beautifully shot look at the way wandering cowboys worked and the often harsh life they lead. It's amazing to think that the story is set as recently as the 1960s since it almost feels as though it was set in the nineteenth century. The landscape itself has a timeless quality. The soundtrack was particularly haunting, certainly moving my girlfriend Natasha to tears in several places.
B00005V1B1|5.0|Camel what a great band very progressive jazz rock some of the best music of the seventys and fantastic cover.
B0000DK4RQ|5.0|It is a shame that the TV show went on to become such a hit, because to my generation, and anyone younger, thats all anyone associates the title to. M*A*S*H was actually a great American movie, in fact, one of the best, before it turned into that sappy, melodramatic, crap fest it turned into on seventies TV. I have suggested this movie to my peers, countless times, only to be responded with countless groans...\\"Wally, c'mon.. don't make us watch this..\\"<br /><br />Oh man! You guys are all missing out. This movie is awesome! It is a comedy all the way, but it is a film also. Worthy of the academy.. and it's kick ass! Sharp and slick, and as another reviewer stated a few spots down, much to my delight.. offensive.<br /><br />Now I know how some of you feel. I was forced to watch countless hours of the TV show when I was a kid. I hated it. Oh man, did I hate that show. I figured I'd hate the movie too, but I was way wrong. I first saw this film when I was around twelve, and instantly became a fan.<br /><br />First of all the cast is stellar. And the characters are a lot different. Donald Sutherland plays a much cooler Hawkeye than Alan Alda ever could. Ditto Robert Duvall as Frank... and Elliot Gould as Trapper. The TV show didn't even have Trapper for more than a season, he was replaced by B.J... What a geek that guy was! Lets not forget Tom Skerrit, and Sally Kellerman.. the REAL \\"HotLips\\" Houllihan...<br /><br />Exhibit Two: The theme song. How many nights have you turned off your TV, just because you can't bare to hear that awful theme song. Well, it's actually a song called \\"Suicide is Painless\\".. which actually has lyrics, and is actually a pretty great theme song to the movie. A little bit deppressing, but also a little inspirational at the same time.<br /><br />Exhibit three: The book. Based on true stories from a man who was actually in a MASH unit during the Korean War. Richard Hooker. He despised the TV show as much as you and me. He considered it a disgrace towards his own work. I couldn't agree more. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE!!! HIGHLY! and I am talking specifically to all of you out there who are not aware that it has very little in common with the crappy TV show.ouldn't agree more. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE!!! HIGHLY! and I am talking specifically to all of you out there who are not aware that it has very little in common with the crappy TV show. <br /> <br /> <br />
B0006399FS|5.0|I just have one thing to ask of those so called fans out there who gave this album a low rating; \\"Did you even LISTEN to the album?!\\" I mean come on!!! What was it you didn't like? Was it the fact that the band harkened back to a time gone by? Or maybe it was the song \\"Miracle Drug\\" that turned you off because I mean who could care about a song that's asking for all of us to do what we can to find a cure for life threatining diseases. \\"No wait, it's because you saw Bono and The Edge in a commercial for an IPod. Maybe you just don't want to hear the absolute truth about our society and how now, more than ever, we need to come together as one.<br /><br />  I will go on record as saying that after having bought all of U2's albums and having listened to each one for hours on end, that I believe this one to be their most poignant to date. Why? Simply because it fuses the old with the new and delievers a message that can absolutly not be denied.<br /><br />  When war was released it such an impact globally and began to make a whole generation of people ask questions about why there was a concrete wall in Berlin; why a child in Somalia was carrying around an AK 47; why can't Ireland be unified; why must innocent people die because of their religous beliefs. These are questions that we should begin asking yet again.<br /><br />  \\"How Dismantle An Atomic Bomb\\" is an absolutly timeless album. A classic that I wish everyone would buy. It is complete poetry in motion in the form of The Edge's astro riffs, Adam Clayton's phenominal heart pumping bass chords, Larry Mullen Jr.'s magic with drum sticks and Bono's melodic banshee like wails. You need to hear this album to experience and appreciate the work that has gone into this. An album for the entire population.<br /><br />  So before you call out U2 for not having enough songs on the album, being sell outs to a corporate world and not being the U2 that you \\"grew up\\" listening to, YOU need to ask yourself, \\"Am I really listening to what is going on in my world right now?\\" Well if the answer is know, then you need to become aware of what is happening to YOU!!! Now you can either watch the news, (not FOX News), go online, travel or listen to this album again. If it does not inspire you to make a difference in the world, then I can't help you my friend. But I know just the guy for you to sit idly by with; \\"It is with no great pleasure of mine to introduce you to The President of the United States of America.\\"-Peyton Randolpho ask yourself, \\"Am I really listening to what is going on in my world right now?\\" Well if the answer is know, then you need to become aware of what is happening to YOU!!! Now you can either watch the news, (not FOX News), go online, travel or listen to this album again. If it does not inspire you to make a difference in the world, then I can't help you my friend.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|Before watching Serenity I had never heard of the Firefly universe. Halfway through the Serenity movie, I hit pause and logged on to Amazon to see if there was more...and there was. After seeing Serenity, I am now purchasing the whole Firefly series.     Firefly is character driven sci-fi that is light (in a good way) on special effects, and heavy on story. A great aspect of the series is that you never know what is going to happen next.     The crew of Firefly is filled with real people, with flaws, but they are very lovable. There is a degree of bickering between the crew, but it is done is a very believable way. It comes off as the arguments you had as a child with your siblings: you disagreed, but at the end of the day you still cared for one another, and had each other's back.     Something not often mentioned in these reviews is the fact that the show's cast is well put together. Not only do they work well together, but each has a very unique screen presence that only fortifies the story.     My heart is saddened, as a new fan to the Firefly universe, that this is the end. This show should never have been cancelled. I hope they bring it back. I have been watching TV for 30 years and have never loved a show as much as I love Firefly.    If you are a sci-fi fan, checking out Firefly and the Serenity movie is a must. But you have been warned: once you see the movie, be prepared to spend $50 on purchasing the Serenity and Firely series DVDs.
B0002CHIJW|5.0|I am so tired of reading posts about how somebody \\"can't believe that anyone would watch this trash,\\" \\"this movie is a waste of time,\\" etc. I am equally tired of reading the obligatory disclaimers that every supporter of this movie seems to include in posts about how watching a rape scene is so difficult, and implying that a rape scene is the most horrible thing that can possibly be filmed.  <br /> <br />I think it's interesting that rape is so taboo, but just about any other form of violence is not at all. Look at Silence of the Lambs, for instance. That is a critically acclaimed movie that is aired on network TV at least twice a year, and it seems to be the sort of gruesome torture movie that the whole family can love! How is Buffalo Bill's serial-killing of women, and torturing of women by keeping them in a well in his basement, less disturbing than a woman being raped?  <br /> <br />That movie not graphic enough for the argument to be valid? How about the new (and thoroughly crappy) movie, Hostel. Aside from the fact that the movie is just not a good film in the genre, look at its content: in one scene, a young girl is tortured so that her eye is removed from its socket and her face is severely burned. Now I have to ask... how is ISOYG's Jennifer's ordeal even remotely comparable to that girl's? At least Jennifer has a full physical recovery and even gets to exact revenge on all of her perpetrators!  <br /> <br />And yet ISOYG exists only in a sort of underground world where most people who watch it and find it to be a satisfying film would be quite hesitant to admit so in mixed company. All because of the rape.  <br /> <br />Personally, I thought this movie was fantastic because I am driven toward and satisfied by movies that strike me as being very real and generate a strong emotional response from me. I found the characters and plot to be quite believable, and the film aesthetic to be thoroughly creepy. Like The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, the documentary feel and the horror-juxtaposed-with-beautiful-scenery was very effective, and it reminds me of how often, in real life, there is crazy stuff going on beneath a picturesque veneer. There were so many intelligent, small details in this movie that contribute to its realness. Most Steven Spielberg flicks do not achieve that.  <br /> <br />ISOYG has to be one of my favorite films of all time because I was utterly transfixed throughout the entire viewing, emotionally connected to it. I will never forget several of the scenes. How many films do that? I can count those that I've seen on two hands, and I have seen a LOT of movies. Further, I can't help but feel like I learned something by watching this film and all of the thinking that it stimulates about our world. These kinds of scenes play out in life every day (just watch the news) and perhaps you ignore them at your peril.  <br /> <br />The world I live in is mostly civilized and happy. I watch a lot of movies, and few of them are horror. I would never in a million years intentionally hurt another person except in defense (or maybe in revenge, in the moment, who knows). So I don't feel guilty about watching this or enjoying it. I'm glad I can watch it from the comfort and safety of my sofa, and I hope that's the only place I'll ever see it. But if I should ever find myself the victim of something like this, perhaps I will handle it a little better without having the naivete of those who would refuse to watch such \\"garbage.\\"  <br />
B00000255X|5.0|For sometime now I had been searching for this album in stores because two of my favorite Dylan songs (Hurricane and Joey) were on it and hadn't had much luck last night I was going through my parents vinyl records because I had just won a retro portable record player off EBay and low and be hold here was \\"Desire\\" was and what a magical album it was, really great reading music cause I sat listening to the rest of \\"Desire\\" while reading the biography of one Bob's dear friends Allen Ginsberg.
B000002H6C|5.0|One of my favorite albums of all time. I've been listening to it for the last 10 years and it never loses its relevance. No current metal album stacks up to it and it sounds just as fresh as the first time I listened to it.
044100590X|5.0|Dune is a classic. If you are a fan of science fiction, you have to read this book.<br /><br />The first time that I read Dune I was a young teenager and I was just blown away by the world that Herbert created. It is so rich and full of interesting concepts and people.<br /><br />This book is one of six in a series, so it will appeal to readers who like to read a series of books, but it is great as a stand alone novel, as well.
B00005JNRY|4.0|This movie will definetely make you smile!  It's an interesting idea too.  Think about it, some people do treat thier cars like humans!  Even better than other people OR themselves.  It is hard to believe but I've seen them!  I know there are people out there who name their cars.  Admit it!  Anyway, this is a great story for the kid's to learn about winning and losing in life.  But sitting there for two hours might pose a challenge for little Timmy.  \\"Mommy, mommy, mommy, I need to go to the bathroom.\\"  There was also a moment that reminded me of Toy Story 2, that could've beem cut.  The scene when Lightning Mcqueen is being told how prosperous Radiator Springs was and how the interstate distracted the other cars away from it was kind of typical.  Remeber it was the scene with a Randy Newman written song?  Does it sound like Cowgirl Jessie's story about how Emily (I think that's the girl's name...) forgot about her and left her in a charity box.  It seemed the same.  Well, that's how I felt.  That would've cut about ten minutes.  Other then that, the movie was hillarious, creative, and most importantly, like all Pixar films, it appealed to the young and old.  Good job Pixar!  Keep up the great work!
B0006GAI6O|5.0|\\"Shall We Dance\\" is, in my opinion, one of the best romantic comedies in years. I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to watch a movie with some good entertainment value. You will particularly enjoy this film if you like to watch Ballroom Dancing competitions on PBS or the program \\"Dancing With The Stars\\". I also recommend that you watch the original Japanese version of \\"Shall We Dance\\", which this movie is based on. Both films share similiarities, but it is interesting to watch both versions of \\"Shall We Dance\\" and make your own comparisons. My favorite of the two is the American version of \\"Shall We Dance\\", with Richard Gere.  He is a multi-talented actor with a touch of Fred Astaire. And he can really dance!
B000GCFO0I|4.0|I liked this movie a lot. That may result from the fact that I am a big fan of the Silent Hill videogames. I also love this type of horror: weird monsters, bizarre nightmarish settings, and no logic to be found anywhere. The game was inspired by this type of horror: the works of H.P. Lovecraft, Clive Barker and Stephen King, Barker's Hellraiser, Wes Craven's Nightmare on Elm Street, Adrian Lyne's Jacob's Ladder and probably Italian goremasters such as Dario Argento and Lucio Fulci. So that's what you're in for with Silent Hill. You're either a fan of this type of stuff, or you're not. Personally, I love it. Give me monsters and creatures over serial killers and slashers any day. Surreal horror (or fantasy horror) is by far the most interesting horror subgenre to me. <br /> <br />We have a very atmospheric, creepy, story-driven, very cinematic game which would seemingly be perfect for a movie adaptation. We have a director, Christophe Gans, who is a big fan of the game and downright passionate about making the movie. It would seem that the movie is in the right hands. However, the results are unfortunately very uneven. While unable to break the long-running videogame movie curse, Silent Hill stills ends up being a very worthwhile movie for certain viewers. That would be fans of the videogame and/or fans of surreal Clive Barker-esque horror. Director Gans has done a remarkable job. The movie looks amazing. The production design and cinematography are top-notch, recreating the look and feel of the game perfectly. The ash snowfall, the deserted streets, the ubiquitous fog, even the wild camera angles. In fact, the first half of Silent Hill is so good that the second half is immensely disappointing in comparison. I think the filmmakers got too concerned with faithfully adapting the game that they gave little consideration to plot and dialogue. As in the games, the story is oblique and often incomprehensible. However, what makes the movie worthwhile are the strong points:creepy atmosphere, awesome bizarre monsters and lots of blood and gore. <br /> <br />However, as I said before the movie is far from perfect. Some of the dialogue is downright horrible, some of the acting is pretty bad, some of the CG effects are less than stellar, and of course the story makes very little sense. For me, those flaws did not detract from the viewing experience. I still enjoyed the movie immensely because of what it gets right. Some will be able to overlook the many flaws and enjoy the good stuff, others won't and will probably hate the movie. A lot of viewers will probably leave the movie saying \\"What the @#$*?\\" But at most, Silent Hill should (like the game) find a devoted cult following. I really want to see a sequel, because there is so much potential here that the movie didn't quite live up to and I would love to see more monsters, more Pyramid Head and more Darkness. Hopefully the sequel will correct the first movie's flaws. I do hope that Christophe Gans will return for the second film and hopefully, with a better script, it will live up to the enormous potential of the game's concept. But until then I will just enjoy the movie. I am very much looking forward to the DVD release. <br /> <br />So for fans of the game, do check out the movie. For fans of surreal fantasy-horror, check it out. Anyone else may want to proceed with caution.
B000F4RHB6|5.0|When I saw this greatest hits album from Huey Lewis and the News, I panicked!  Their music always sounds the best in the summer!  I didn't know they had 21 hits.  I thought as a band, it ended after Hard At Work in 1991, but they had a few hits here and there during the decade.  But that period of hits through 4 albums in the '80s is fully covered here. I still love \\"Heart and Soul\\", my favorite from 1983's \\"Sports\\", the catchy guitars on \\"The Power of Love\\", \\"Perfect World\\" from 1988, \\"Back in Time\\", \\"Small World\\"(which is as '80s a song as you can get), the nice duet that Huey Lewis did with Gwyneth Paltow that shows his R&B influences, \\"Heart Of Rock and Roll\\", \\"New Drug\\", and \\"Do You Believe In Love.\\"  One of the rare artists to have a few hits when they didn't have an album out in 1985. This could be a message to today's artists who take 3 to 4 years between albums to not keep your fans stranded. The fact that they produced their own albums and music shows the creativity they had and still have.  Would have liked a few personal song favorites from Huey or the band members instead of just only the hits. Loved the horns, the rocking guitars, the addictive and catchy rhythms and songs. Huey's singing is dynamic on everything, very R&B influenced among the pop sounds the band made. Sorry that Chysalis Records dropped them, but this allows the band to do the songs they want to make. Saw them in concert in 2003--they were superb live!  I know that they're going to be tearing up stages again this summer!
0140157352|5.0|The book, GETTING TO YES, by Roger Fisher and William Ury is perhaps the most important book on negotiation I have ever read.  I have personally benefitted from this book simply because I am even more aware of the importance of preparation and identifying shared interests and taking advantage of them.  Respect, always respect, the other person's interests.  More importantly, know them well.      Highlights:  The book is on principled negotiation, which is essentially negotiation on merits.  The aim is to reach a wise agreement, defined as meeting the legitimate interests of all parties to the extent possible, resolving conflicting interests fairly, and ensuring the agreement is durable and takes community interests in account.    The factors of principled negotiation include:    PEOPLE:  separting people from the issues/problems.  INTERESTS:  focus on them, particularly mutual interests, and not on \\"positions.\\"  E.g., the expression of \\"you are in no position to negotiation\\" is absolutely absurd.  One, it is an assumption unless the person stating that carefully prepared.  Two, it can generally only hurt the person stating that, generating hostility and conflict.  A principled negotiator probes interests, raises questions. The question, then, is \\"what are your interests in this deal?\\" and \\"Why do you suppose that is a fair proposal?\\"  PLANNING:  a skilled negotiator will gather, organize, and weigh all information carefully relating to a negotiation.  If there is one concept I could share with you, it is \\"prepare.\\"  CRITERIA:  prior to reaching an agreement, the parties should agree to using objective criteria to measure an agreement; these include market value, precedent, and so forth.  OPTIONS:  generate a variety of options to reach an agreement.  Envision what a successful outcome would be from the negotiation prior to negotiation, then generate several possibilities of satisfying everyone's interests to obtain the goal.      Specific Questions I had that were answered:  a)  When personally attacked, what to do?  Control yourself, let the other side vent, then remain silent.  Do not embarrass them, do not attack back.      b)  More on this concept of \\"interests?\\"  First, find shared interests.  Two, acknolwedge the other side's interests as a part of the whole system of negotiation.  Share what your interests are pointedly, then provide your reasoning for reaching your proposal.    c)  If the other side is way more powerful?  One must know her/his BATNA well.  It is your Best Alternative to Negotiated Agreement (I think that is the correct acroynm).  The better your BATNA is, the more power you have.  If you have a very bad BATNA, you must realize that \\"how\\" you negotiate is extremely important.  Your BATNA should be your measure against any proposal made by the other side.  If your BATNA is better, then you obviously reject the proposal.    d)  What if the other side is choleric, tricky, and applies pressures to force me into agreement?  You should first recognize the tactics being used.  \\"Oh, this is the old good and bad cop routine.\\"  Then, expose it.  Say, \\"excuse me, unless I am mistaken, you two are playing good cop and bad cop with me.  Now, let's just focus on interests and reach a mutually satisfying agreement.\\"  If they put sun in your eyes, request to move. If your enviroment is hostile or discomforting, you have a right to request a change in setting.  Most importantly, recognize them... do not be phased by them.    e)  I am powerful, they are weak.  How should/can I exploit them?  Resources do not make you a powerful negotiator.  All the king's soldiers and all the king's men cannot make you a powerful negotiator, particularly if your socalled \\"power\\" will not impact the other side.  It is best to focus on mutual interests and attempt to reach an agreement to satisfying them.  Threating a person, mentioning your power will most-likely undermine your ability to reach agreement.      In conclusion, this book canbe a benefit for all people.  Why?  It shows you how to take into account other people's interests to satisfy your own.  It is crucial for individuals to terminate the concept that to \\"win\\" in negotiations is to take advantage of other people.  To succeed in negotiation, it is not about exploiting people but getting what you want.  Essentially, satisfying your interests; this book can show you how.      I hope the above was helpful,  Clovis
B0000TB01Y|5.0|Every track on this soundtrack is incredible. Having seen the show with the original cast itself, I was skepticle an album could capture the brilliance. However, the combination of an amazing cast and timeless tunes that are all very catchy, the cd does not disappoint. My favorites are: What Is This Feeling, Dancing Through Life, Popular, Defying Gravity, As Long As Your Mine, and No Good Deed. However, my absolute favorite on the cd is For Good, it is very emotionally touching and well sung by Chenoweth and Menzel.
B000EHRVP6|2.0|Horror films need more than just sex and slashers ...so if you're looking for something with higher level cinema, you best look elsewhere. HOSTEL is designed for the young man with an appetite for video-game style plots.<br /><br />The films premise is, at least, interesting. A Hostel in a Slovakian city is a jumping-off point for nightclubs, sexual encounters, drugs ...and murder. The hostel owners are secretively helping a select group of the rich and demented. These wealthy and twisted individuals pay to kill people, and an \\"art house\\" on the outskirts of town acts as the facilitator of horrors. For those unweary travelers who happen to fall victim to the wiles of the hostel owners, ending up drugged only to reawaken in Hell on Earth is a gruesome and life-ending discovery.<br /><br />Paxton (Jay Hernandez) and his friends Josh (Derek Richardson) and Oli (Eythor Gudjonsson) are three college students traveling through Europe. They stop at this hostel and are quickly enraptured with a couple of young women who have an appetite for sex. Once fully involved with these women, the boys begin dropping off one by one.<br /><br />Fairly pedestrian in nature, this horror film has little to offer in the way of entertainment.
0316921173|5.0|I finally worked up the temerity to read a chunk of this book, and it's not like <br />reading a book; it's like getting sucked into a whole different world of various  <br />people's addictions.  It IS readable but demands some involvement on the part of the reader.  Lots of footnotes and definitions to look up are part of the fun.  Other people here have written much better reviews, but if you need  a little encouragement, note that Jonathan Franzen, who wrote the great Corrections, has said that this is a \\"contract novel\\", that is, David Foster Wallace wrote it FOR the reader, not AT you.
B000ENV2P0|5.0|I bought this for my husband. He is a die hard fan!! It is the only thing he asked our 4 year old son to get him for father's day. Ofcourse, I told him I couldn't find it. Haha!! I am so excited!!! I haven't opened it yet, due to the fact that it's a gift for my honey, but it's about to kill me. All we've done for probally 2 or 3 weeks is sing the Dana Califonia song. That is an awsome song. They may be in their mid 40's, but I am pretty sure that they \\"The Red Hot Chili Peppers\\" will keep on rockin us for more years to come. They just have to, Dam*t!!!!<br /><br />I recommend everyone buys this CD. It will difenitly be a keeper!!!! I give it 2 thumbs up man.

B00005UQ9F|5.0|I picked up this little gem at Blockbuster.  Didn't have high expectations for it....most horror movies don't impress me.  This one did. Filmed in an actual insane asylum. Mainly a psychological thriller. Four cleaning guys clean asbestos out of an abandoned insane asylum. Soon they start hearing noises and go meandering curiously.  That's when the fun starts.  Great plot with creepy lighting and sound effects.  Highly recommended!  Pick this up next time you are at the video store!! Your feedback of the movie would be appreciated.  Tell me what you think...
B00003CXXP|1.0|A.I. is possibly one of the worst movies I have ever seen.  The scenes are all over the place, making it very difficult to follow. I would not recommend this movie to anyone, regardless of their age.  Bitter till the very end...
B00008WT5M|3.0|Although The Razor's Edge would be AC/DC's biggest selling album since Back in Black, in retrospect it's not one of their better albums. In fact, if it weren't for the awesome opener \\"Thunderstruck\\" and the hit single \\"Moneytalks\\", it would be in the 2-star range as well as their worst album, yes even worse than Fly on the Wall. All of the Bon Scott albums, including the '74 Jailbreak EP are better and certainly more consistent than The Razor's Edge. Basically, this is a classic case of the singles carrying the rest of the album. Well, not completely since \\"Are You Ready\\" is the lamest single they ever released. The album isn't a total loss since \\"Fire Your Guns\\", \\"Mistress for Christmas\\" and the title track all have great riffs and are very good. But after that, the album goes downhill and never recovers. \\"Rock Your Heart Out\\" is corny, \\"Shot of Love\\" and \\"Let's Make It\\" are very pedestrian, and the only cool thing about \\"Got You by the Balls\\" is the title. As noted before, \\"Thunderstruck\\", one of their best songs ever, and \\"Moneytalks\\", save this from being their worst album. Recommended for the first five songs only. Or just pick up AC/DC Live: The Collector's Edition which contains all of them except \\"Mistress for Christmas.\\"
0385336691|5.0|The intuitive Jack Reacher strikes again in this exciting and very satisfying thriller. It's hard to say this but I think Jack Reacher is one of my favorite thriller characters.<br /><br />Lee Childs gift of writing seems to just get better with each subsequent novel.

B00005JOFQ|5.0|What is there to say that hasn't already been said of Brokeback Mountain?  The controversy.  The protests.  The naked hatred aimed at the movie and its subject matter.  All that truly need be said of the film is that it is one of the most powerful and moving film experiences I have ever had.  I was blown away by the raw power of the film, the depth of the characters, the beautiful score and cinematography.  And the performances are amazing.  A melancholy air runs through the film and the end is heart-wrenching.  It is not a \\"gay movie\\" as was so freqeuntly espoused upon its initial release.  It is simply a story of love forbidden and the lives it irreversibly scars.  Hands down, the best movie of '05.
0790731924|5.0|Saw this movie on HBO and loved it.Rated R for violence,language,some drug use and sexualty.Canada:18A.Not for children. <br />
0920668372|1.0|This book is equal parts maudlin and creepy. Neither of those characteristics bode well for a children's bedtime story.  I suppose that for young children who don't really understand it, and only really want to be held and hear a parent's voice, the quality of the book itself doesn't matter. But in which case, you still don't need to buy this book. Pick up something nice by Shel Silverstein, Margaret Wise Brown, Eric Carle or Sandra Boynton instead.
B0000AQS6R|5.0|Christmas Vacation is a classic holiday movie.  Though a little raunchy at times, I could watch this movie over and over again.  This movie makes the viewer laugh non-stop, and is thoroughly enjoyable throughout.  Though I do not particularly like Randy Quaid's character, I do enjoy the acting of Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo.  I recommend this movie to anyone, anytime.
B00005JKJA|5.0|This movie is ridiculous.  When I first saw it, I'll admit, I pretty much considered it the worst movie I'd ever seen.  There came a chance happening when I told a friend of mine that it was the worst movie I'd ever seen, and he flipped out and called me an idiot, swearing that it was amazing.  Just to make sure I wasn't a complete imbecile, I watched it again.  And again... and again... and I haven't stopped watching it since I found out what the hell it was about.  I mean, this is a movie where a lesbian love scene actually has something to do with the plot.  Intriguing, I know.  If you've seen it and think it sucked, or heard it was terrible from a friend, do yourself a favor and watch it a couple more times.  Look it up on the internet and get the answers to the questions you assumed had no answer.  Give it another shot, because it's one of the best movies in existence.
0679722610|4.0|This was my first time reading a hard-boiled detective novel and I loved it.  Hammett is an impressive writer with an amazing talent of packing in tons of action into very few words.  Example:<br /><br />\\"A garbage can helped me over the gate into a brick-paved yard.  The side fence of that yard let me into another, and from that I got into another, where a fox terrier raised hell at me.<br /><br />I kicked the pooch out of the way, made the opposite fence, untangled myself from a clothes line, crossed two more yards, got yelled at from a window, had a bottle thrown at me, and dropped into a cobblestoned back street.\\"<br /><br />This story is about a nameless private detective who's called upon by an important man in Personville, but the client is murdered before the detective can meet him.  He decides to do a little investigation of his own and before you know it the entire town is in chaos with non-stop shoot outs, wholesale murder, crooked cops, a dangerous woman and lots of drinking and trash talking.
0307277674|1.0|After I read that one-in-five Americans have read this book, I decided to join the crowd. I found the premise interesting and looked forward to the story. However, this is one of the most poorly written books I've ever encountered. The prose is so pedestrian and the \\"suspense\\" so predictable. Finally I just couldn't take it anymore and thought I'd see the movie version. And now I hear that it is equally bad. Why do so many people like this book? I'm mystified....

1400032717|5.0|The best kinds of books are the ones that are not only fun to read, but also alter the way we as readers think about things. The curious incident of the dog in the night-time gives the reader a view into the world of autism, in a variety of creative and funny ways.<br /><br />Christopher John Francis Boone- an autistic boy who can count prime numbers in his head, discovers his neighbor's dog dead one night and resolves to solve the `mystery' of who killed the dog. He soon discovers it was someone it he hadn't expected, and ends up on a journey across urban England.<br /><br />The story is told through Christopher's own autistic point of view, a vivid and interesting voice: The chapters are prime numbers, he explains math problem to the reader, he adds very detailed images of things he drew in his head, and he starts almost every sentence with the word \\"and\\". The book is a fascinating and suspenseful look at life through the eyes of a boy who thinks differently- a quick and fun read.<br /><br />4.5/5
B000301YY8|1.0|If it were scientifically possible to cross-breed Rod Stewart with a Central American 3-toed sloth who makes mating calls out of its armpits while in heat, it would sound like Mr. Blunt.  <br />If you own a restaurant and had to chose between playing James Blunt or a repeating sound loop of fingernails being scraped across a chalkboard, go with the fingernails.

B000EHSVQE|5.0|Hilarious movie. The movie is character driven instead of plot driven. The lack of plot makes you focus on the characters more. You care about the main characters even uncle Rico in the end. The main themes in the movie are alienation and diversity. The movie is completely clean and its success is attributed to its unforgetable characters. The last scene where Napoleon tells Deb \\"I caught you a delicious bass\\" will be remembered as one of the most romantic moments on film.  <br /> <br />The film is made and acted by mostly Brigham Young University (Mormon) film school graduates. This explains why it is so clean. I am also Mormon and the movie is very much an inside joke about Mormons living in the small towns along the Idaho and Utah border. Napoleon wears a yellow t-shirt in the movie that says Ricks College which is an Idaho Mormon college. Napoleon says things like Gosh! and Flippin! instead of cursing and that is typically Mormon and makes me laugh because it is dead on. Also, like Napoleon, Mormons have sweet dance moves. <br />
B0000041LA|5.0|Austerity is a quality which I would associate with Prokofiev very closely. Cold winters in the city formerly known as Moscow. Lenin, Stalin, and the vice-like grip of the KGB breathing down your neck at every corner help associate this quality with this Soviet-era composer. Ashkenazy, who grew up in the Soviet era, plays with austerity. The tone is harsh. The slight atonalities here and there are highlighted well.
B00005JOX6|5.0|I really gotta see this film when it comes out.Rated PG-13 for language,crude and sex related humor and some drug refernces.
B000EULJLU|4.0|First of all, I'm going to have to disagree with Jason Jurcak on a few things from his review.  I agree with him 100% that \\"Vicarious\\" is an awesome song.  Heck, I grabbed it from the internet weeks before the CD even came out because I couldn't get enough of it.  However, it is the second best song on the CD.  The the best song, without a doubt, is \\"Right in Two\\".  This is an amazing, perfect song, falling slightly short of divinity.  This song is right at the same level and just as good as \\"Stairway to Heaven\\".  Jason, I respect your opinion and I know where you're coming from, but I just don't see how you can look past this song.  Now granted, there were a few tracks that were quite pointless: 6,7, and 11.  Those should all have been real songs and not little intermission tracks.  After five years of waiting, Tool should have released a full length album with more than eight full length songs.  They also could have had a few more really hard songs as well.  \\"Lateralus\\" is still their best album by far and one of my favorite CD's of all time.  \\"10,000 Days\\" is not near as good as \\"Lateralus\\", but it's still better than \\"Undertow\\".  \\"Right in Two\\" alone makes this album worth purchasing.  That song is why I am giving this album 4 stars instead of 3.
0224076051|5.0|Before I begin, let me just mention that my PhD supervisor was (and is) a leading string theorist and author of the recently published 'A First Course in String Theory'. <br /> <br />It is interesting to read the review by Lubos Motl, who is a somewhat extreme example of an outstanding young 'establishment' theoretical physicist who like so many others has been lured onto the string theory bandwagon, which for him has now become an obsession. While attacking Woit's blog, he fails to mention that he himself also has a well-known blog which panders to the cravings of fellow string theory devotees. <br /> <br />His review of Woit's book, like many of his writings, is an exercise in intellectual nit-picking, where the underlying argument can be summarised as, \\"my (our) mathematical ability and knowledge of theoretical physics is far superior to yours, therefore I (we) are right, and you are (not even) wrong\\". Motl is the kind of person who would have considered Einstein to be a mathematical lightweight who most likely stumbled upon his theory of relativity more by chance than skill. Indeed, Motl would certainly have been amongst those who poo-pooed Einstein and his ideas until his death. While it is probably true that Motl and many other string theorists like him are technically more sophisticated than Einstein ever was (or could even hope to be back in those days), in terms of originality, creativity and raw insight, Einstein really would put Motl and his ilk to shame. That is why Einstein will always be 'Einstein', and Motl will always be plain 'Motl'. Motl is nothing but a sheep in wolf's clothing. <br /> <br />Putting such things aside, it is certainly true that string theory is by far the most beautiful and complex physical theory that man has ever contemplated, so that it is hardly surprising to find so many young researchers drawn to it. It is also one of the very few theories currently under serious investigation as a possible 'theory of everything', with the potential to unify gravity and the standard model. There was a time long ago when string theory was thought (or rather, hoped) to be a single unique theory, but the proliferation of string vacua (the 'landscape') and the consequent complete lack of predictiveness should, for any reasonable-minded person, dash any hope of it being the 'theory of everything'. Rather, the huge number of manually tunable parameters make it a 'theory of almost anything'. Given any particular universe you can imagine, the chances are that there is a string theory (or more likely, lots of them), which describe it. To still hold on to the vain and distant hope that maybe, just maybe, there is some deep, as yet unknown, underlying symmetry principle which will somehow manage to pick out our particular universe as the only possible one out of the infinite number of possible stringy universes, is beyond wishful thinking - it is an exercise in pure self-delusion. Unfortunately, \\"all that glitters is not gold\\" - mathematical beauty in and of itself simply does not imply correctness. <br /> <br />Of course string theory should continue to be studied, but the physics establishment is in a state of crisis when an extraordinarily disproportionate number of people are investigating a model which potentially has nothing useful to say about the real world. Time, money and effort are surely better spent elsewhere. <br /> <br />Even though it may leave a bitter taste in the mouths of the more fanatical string theory advocates, Woit's book remains an important contribution, and for the sake of scientific advancement we would do well to take note of the issues he raises.
B00005JOWR|2.0|I'm kicking myself for not appreciating my high school and college lit courses until it was too late.  Because it seems like every time I go to the movies I remember back to one of the classics in literature that I callously never read.  It was Jonathan Swift's A Modest Proposal I thought back on after finishing THANK YOU FOR SMOKING, because I now realize that modern satire is joke.<br /><br />Nick Naylor (Aaron Eckhardt, In The Company of Men)  is as smooth as the cigarettes he's promoting.  As the main lobbyist for big tobacco, it's his job to look America in the eye and say \\"Want to smoke.\\"  The film follows him as he convinces group after group that Big Tobacco is the victim and that those who are fighting against him are the villains.  There are bumps along the way, including a senator from Vermont (William H. Macy), a nosy journalist (Katie Holmes), and a few attempts on his life.  But with some good old American B.S. he may just make it.<br /><br />THANK YOU FOR SMOKING is an almost biting satire, it presents all the characters a great satire needs, and it's full of button pushing ideas that should drag the audience right along with it.  But squanders them by playing too safe, by not taking sides, and by coping out at the last moment.  Great satire should end with half the characters dead lying in a physical, psychological, or farcical bloodbath. Like in Swift's A Modest Proposal, where he mentions that his countrymen would do well to resort to cannibalism.  The hero of the story should be standing next to God, or burning in hell for his misdeeds.  THANK YOU FOR SMOKING just winks at you, provides a couple of laughs, and that's all.<br /><br />The major problem is that the screenplay, by Jason Reitman (who also directs), falls in love with the main character to a degree that allows him the opportunity to get away with everything.  That's would be fine, but the villains in the film are not drawn as well and so his victory's seem paltry.  His Villains are so stereotypical and the actors bring nothing to them that is very profound.  Satire without some blood and guts on the floor is pointless.<br /><br />As for the performances they just sit there.  No one is big enough.  That actors wander in and out of each scene, and the only one we really get to know is Nick.  But Nick is not that vulnerable, even when the script tries to paint him that way.  Aaron Eckhardt is too confident. I didn't believe his small moment of insecurity once.  Because the script doesn't let him fail for long.<br /><br />THANK YOU FOR SMOKING is not a bad movie.  It's pretty funny and  It's quite timely.  But as a satire it's not focused enough, and it doesn't pull enough punches.  I'm glad I saw it, but I don't recommend it.are so stereotypical and the actors bring nothing to them that is very profound.

Aaron Eckhardt is too confident. I didn't believe his small moment of insecurity once.  Because the script doesn't let him fail for long.   <br /> <br />THANK YOU FOR SMOKING is not a bad movie.  It's pretty funny and  It's quite timely.  But as a satire it's not focused enough, and it doesn't pull enough punches.  I'm glad I saw it, but I don't recommend it.

B000008GEF|5.0|If all you've heard off this album is 'Give Me Love', you need to buy it and listen to the rest. I realize that some people may be put off by spirituality, but the music here is not preachy or utopian (listen to Lennon for that). Rather, it's peaceful and personal. Even on the sardonic 'Sue Me, Sue You Blues', you get the feeling that deep inside, George is laughing at the absurd legal wrangling. <br /> <br />Some tracks are close to the late Beatles sound. 'Don't Let Me Wait Too Long' would have been an easy hit if it was on a Wings album and the Phil Spector produced 'Try Some Buy Some' expands on 'I Me Mine'. In truth, these two tracks sound a little out of place compared to the rest. <br /> <br />The other tracks would have been ruined by Spector's wall of sound approach. Delicate spiritual affairs don't need grandiose orchestration and Harrison takes advantage of the freedom to produce music that is personal and more natural. The result is an LP that blends folk with pop and cleanses the soul.
0440234743|3.0|Even though I couldn't put down the book from the moment I picked it up, I felt disappointment after reading the book.  The narrative was long about his time in Brazil, and much of I skipped because I thought the book could have gone without it.  It is exciting though as you keep reading to try and find out what happens to the Phelan heirs, but I wish the outcome could have been different.
0312995423|1.0|There is a japanese guy somewhere here among the reviews who tells about mistakes in japanese language. I would like to add quite a few more and a lot worse. In this book, Mr Brown clearly writes about places he has not visited or has informed himself about, and things he doesn't know at all. For example, he tells about going up the Giralda tower in Seville (Spain), that \\"the steps where narrow and difficult\\". This tower has a big ramp, and the Middle age kings used to climb the tower on horseback!. The City hall is suposed to be in the Plaza de España. Mr. Brown should know, that it's 15 minutes walking to go from one plce to another. Moreover, he writes about being in Spain as if it where a trip to the past and third worldly. Spain is in the EU since 1989, but tourists usually know that you can't just go and bore holes to put a handrail on UNESCO World Heritage buildings. As a spanish woman myself, I feel he should get well informed before writing nonsense. I know it's fiction, but this goes over the limits.
B00005R23X|5.0|Some people watch Bram Stoker's Dracula and are immediately disgusted by the erotica/blood and gore.  At first it seems as though FFC butchered the novel, but upon closer examination a viewer realizes that he actually tapped into the undercurrents of Victorian society.  One of the classic themes in storytelling is the fascination with the dark man/woman, such as in Phantom of the Opera or Time Machine.  In the Introduction to Bram Stoker's Dracula (at least, in my copy), a lit crit expounds upon the undertones of women's sexuality, and on the hidden references to Dracula's sexual power over the female characters in the book.  You may notice in the course of the movie, you never see him draw the blood of a man and you never see Lucy draw the blood of a woman.  This is because the drawing of the blood is a semi-metaphor for intercourse (just look at the face Oldman makes as Ryder begins to drink his blood).  To sum it up, the love story, the reminiscing is not directly referenced in the novel, but the sexual connection/attraction between Dracula and Mina is. <br /> <br />What I personally like about the movie is the soundtrack and the art direction (with the exception of some of the gore and the rape scene).  Most of all, I love this movie for Gary Oldman's beautiful performance.  He is famous for being a 'man without a face' (like as Mason Verger in Hannibal), and in the course of the movie Dracula assumes five different faces. His ability to embody both horror and love, both anger and longing is almost painful to watch because it is so good. At one point he says to his beloved Mina \\"I have crossed oceans of time to find you\\", and his longing almost becomes tangible even through the screen. <br /> <br />I would not describe this movie as a 'must-see' unless you're a horror movie fan.  You have to have a stomach for violence, or a quick finger on the fast-forward button.  Additional criticism: Keanu Reeves doesn't do the 'love' thing; the brides of Dracula are over the top; Dracula isn't evil enough. <br /> <br />This movie is one of my favorite romance movies (for an idea of where I stand, I should tell you that Hannibal is also one of my favorite romance movies).  The longing displayed is of a Phantom of the Opera calibur, and reaches to parts of the human psyche that most people don't even realize are there. <br />
0974153001|5.0|There are a few instructional books on pc that I can say deliver what they promised on the cover and this is one of them. Usually when I buy books in amazon is like a gamble because I can't flip through the pages of the books I'm buying and sometimes I get dissapointed. But I'm glad I took a chance with this book. From the start, it gives you information about tools and different clays. I mean, she even goes to tell you how can you make some of your tools with clay. The models are well done, these days there aren't many artists that bother with details like muscles and veins  and she explains that. Excellent book. Couldn't find it at my local Borders or Barnes&Noble and that's a shame because good books should be promoted.
0440237688|5.0|Although few pages, it touches down on so many aspects of life that are taken for granted, while creating a world that can be politically & religiously deciphered as well.  It is a book that I vaguely remember reading when I was younger, yet now, reading it at the age of 23 I have such a deeper appreciation of the complexity that is this piece.   <br />In response to the critics before me, I believe the ending to be exactly what it should be... simple and somewhat open-ended.  Unlike so many books.... the emphasis is what we should all have more appreciation for... the journey.
B00005UEAR|5.0|Dream Theater's sixth studio album, Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence, is 2 CDs worth of bliding prog rock/metal split into two halves: the first five songs on Disc 1 and the epic 42-minute title track on Disc 2.  Let's start with Disc 1: <br /> <br />It opens with one of the BEST prog metal tracks I've ever heard and certainly one of the band's finest moments.  It's parts 1-3 of Mike Portnoy's Alcoholics Anonymous suite (parts 4-6 are This Dying Soul on 2003's Train of Thought and parts 7-8 are The Root of Evil on 2005's Octavarium).  It is savage, brutal, thrashy, yet melodic.  It has some of the most ridiculous displays of musicianship ever committed to tape, not to mention James LaBrie's excellent and varied vocal deliveries.  However, as is usual for DT, the songs are never compromised by the instrumental chops.  This is followed by the excellent, haunting Blind Faith.  Misunderstood is very experimental and eerie and wonderful.  The soaring chorus is a favorite part of mine.  The Great Debate, a song exploring the issues of stem-cell research from both sides of the debate, is fantastic, evoking Rush's masterpiece, Natural Science, and taking the concept further.  The first disc ends with the (for DT) short 6 minute Disappear, which is an excellent closer to the first act before we get to the mammoth title track on disc 2. <br /> <br />Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence (the song) begins with a soaring, majestic Overture and then goes into the Rush-inflected (listen to that intro!) About to Crash.  The entire song involves \\"case-studies\\" of mental illness.  War Inside My Head goes into the brutal metal Test That Stumped Them All, which, along with the About to Crash (reprise), are the peak of this otherwise fantastic song.  Solitary Shell and Goodnight Kiss are less heavy but no less beautiful and exceptional.  Losing Time-Grand Finale close out this phenomenal song and leave us wanting more! <br /> <br />Dream Theater is the rare band that contrast amazing musicalchops with top-notch songwriting and lyrics (carrying on the legacy of Rush, who these guys are HUGE fans of, proudly).  In short, GET THIS ALBUM!
B000F6IOC0|5.0|Some people were confused by the setting. If you couldn't tell the first movie was in Europe, why are you even trying to figure out the second? Some people complained about certain actors' performances... while not oscar-winning actors (atleast not yet) they all approached their characters in a way that feels just right. My only con might be that I wish there could have been more of the story. We all hate the hollywood editing process, but atleast we can hope for an extended edition DVD.  <br />I've seen just about every vampire / werewolf movie ever made (that was atleast subtitled to english) and I have to say the Underworld franchise is my favorite. The Blade sequels has a few shortcomings that Underworld avoided. I'd buy the cheap DVD now, and wait for the extended edition release. If you haven't seen the first movie, then don't even bother waiting for a director's cut.
B00006CXXU|5.0|cHRISTINA SHOULD BE PROUD!...It is so obvious she put so much work in this album, her voice is amazing and the rawness she represents is truly magical...song like \\"walk away\\" 'loving me for me\\" \\"get mine get yours\\" and \\"infatuation\\" are the true highlights...BUT EVERY SONG HERE IS TRULY AMAZING...Every song has a different feel to it and she definitely knows how to keep us listening...she has great range in her voice and she changes it up all the time...from the 45 second long note she held in \\"keep on sinignin my song\\" to dave navarro's guitar in 'fighter\\" and redman's appearance on \\"DIRRTY\\" this has got to be one of the best versatile albums of the 2000's..great follow up...i know we can only expect bigger and better things from Christina!
0064471837|4.0|When Sabriel was born there was no need of a baptism, for she was born dead. But her father, Abhorsen, insisted upon it, then brought her back from the dead. Abhorsen possesses the skills of a necromancer, one who can bargain with Kerrigor, the lord of the dead, to save the souls of those just departed. This is not wholly usual to his work as he generally lays the dead back to rest.<br /><br />Some years later his daughter, Sabriel, is enrolled in a prestigious academy for girls where she receives a message from a specter in the form of her father's sword and the tools of his trade, including his armor  and his bell. She knows this means her father has gone missing into the Old Kingdom and that she must venture forth to find him, no matter what the cost. She dons the symbols of his trade and in this fashion sets off to the Old Kingdom, where she encounters a spirit in the form of a cat named Mogget and some time later releases a man from a curse that has turned him into the stone figurehead of a ship. This is Touchstone, a man from two hundred years past who turns out to be responsible for the birth of Kerrigor. Together they set out to find her father.<br /><br />As critically acclaimed and lauded as this book was it seemed I should have liked it more than I did. It was ok... that's it. I found nothing to dislike about it but I wasn't overly blown away either. This may be due to the fact that at this point in time I am over-fantasied, if that's possible. The last series I read was Megan Whalen Turner's \\"The Thief\\" and the subsequent books in the trilogy. I was blown away by her work, so I think in comparison Nix's work is suffering, and perhaps unnecessarily. The story just seemed a touch lackluster, and I found myself drifting away from it at times. Now, I do make the disclaimer that had I not read Turner's work before (which, incidentally, is not similar in the least)  I may have enjoyed this a tad more. Overall, 4 stars seems right, because I may read it again when some time has passed to reassess. I really wish this had hit me more than it did.hen some time has passed to reassess. I really wish this had hit me more than it did.
B000FBGBPC|5.0|I thought this album was great. I loved it just as much as the first one. Some may say some of the songs are depressing but I think they are singing about what everyone goes through. I think they are quite uplifting for those down times. Anyways I've been a huge fan, Im glad to see they got a new album, and I can't wait to see them again in concert!
B000301YY8|5.0|I love this CD. The music is very well written (as it should be considering who's behind it!) and the lyrics are so meaningful and metaphorical and all that good stuff.  The songs are all easygoing and laid back. I can't stop listening to songs like \\"High\\" and \\"Wisemen\\". - And I like ROCK!!<br /><br />There is a lot of criticism about this CD. Some folks are all worked up about James bein a \\"sellout\\" and this album being processed pop blah, blah, blah... That's fine. I will have to say that, if that were true, I would like it just the same. Good music is good music be it from the heart or the wallet and this CD is definitely fantastic.
B000001ESP|5.0|I was around 11 or 12 years old and a veritable tomboy. I was in metal shop and my buds listened to Maiden, Priest, etc. One day--I think they had the radio on--I heard the most AWESOME song. I thought \\"What in the name of GOD is that???\\"<br /><br />It was like nothing I had ever heard before.<br /><br />It was Tom Sawyer, and I've been hooked ever since. (\\"No changes are permanent...but change is!\\") I remember how hard I had to plead and cajole to get my fundie Mom to allow me to buy a cassette of Moving Pictures. It was around the same time I was pleading to get Shout at the Devil by Motely Crue. LOL<br /><br />Yes, I was allowed to get Moving Pictures! I remember always fast forwarding through Camera Eye and YYZ (hated those songs at the time!). Tom Sawyer, Witch Hunt, Limelight and Vital Signs were my FAVES. Played them to death!<br /><br />Here I am, a few decades later, and Moving Pictures still holds special memories for me. It took me some time to \\"re-discover\\" some songs, and now I can find the brilliance in the instrumental YYZ. (Seeing Neil Peart play this live in concert is a memorable experience. Even my husband, who isn't exactly a Rush fan, gave Neil a standing ovation when he heard him play during the 30th anniversary tour.)<br /><br />Tom Sawyer has never lost it's appeal with me, although I don't play it over and over and over like I did as a youth. (I now prefer the live versions. In fact, it just came on at RushRadio.org, which I listen to ALL THE TIME. WOOHOO!)<br /><br />Neil's lyrics shine, as always, with Witch Hunt especially timely in these paranoid times.<br /><br />Vital Signs remains one of my all time favorite Rush songs. Always felt a kinship to the lyrics, too (\\"everybody got to deviate fromt the norm\\").<br /><br />Moving Pictures is probably the best known Rush album (and has the best cover IMO), so it's a good representation of the early 80's Rush.<br /><br />Happy anniversary, guys! You rock!
B0002OERI0|5.0|ive only heard two green day cds (insomniac, and this one) and this one is by far the better release. Jesus Of Suberbia is great and ranging in at over 9:10. Wake Me Up When September Ends is brilliant their best song to date.
B000EULJLU|5.0|Having loved Lateralus, it took me several listens to fully appreciate 10,000 Days and now can't get enough.  Like a few others here, my initial reaction was that of disappointment over the lack of 'grabbiness' of most songs.  But now, I dig the rhythmic and polyrhythmic grooves, as well many of the lyrics.  You have to wait for the build-up on many tunes, and the James Blunt sound of the opening lines of The Pot threw me off.  It is now my favorite track hands-down...
B000002UJQ|5.0|Rock took ten years to recover from this album.  No band knew how to react.  This album cannot possibly be over-rated in terms of brilliance or impact. <br /> <br />When The Beatles released Sgt. Peppers, they were responding to Pet Sounds.  In turn, The Rolling Stones responded to Sgt. Peppers. Radiohead released this album in the post-grunge vacuum, and as of this writing, no one has attempted a response.  Indie rock eventually came around, as if OK Computer never happened. It's as if bands kept playing Fats Domino covers after they heard Lucy in the Sky or Day in the Life.  <br /> <br />Put it this way: for years, my friends and I thought, with good reason, that this album killed rock.  We all love OK Computer, but it scared every decent band silent.  Don't get me wrong: some excellent indie rock bands are out there and worth listening to, but eventually someone has to step up to the plate and top OK Computer, or 1997 marks the year that rock stopped living and started dying. <br /> <br />You don't know rock if you don't have this album.
B000002BMV|5.0|If you want one Cd that sums up the 80s then this should be it. Classic writing, playing and singing. There are hundreds of reviews that focus on the hits from this CD but this is a complete work of art. From the opening Dont stop believing to the closing Open arms there is not a dud in between. The weakest song is Lay it down, but even that is worthwhile. Have a listen to Still they ride - I still get chills when I hear it. Will we ever get a finer singer than Perry?? I doubt it but what a wonderful way to be able to relive the 80's and that voice. Thank goodness for CD quality as my record had so much static and scratches that it made listening almost impossible. Love the CD, love the songs, love the guitars, love the voice.
B000EULJLU|4.0|Honestly... tool is just good, From hearing vicarious i knew that it was going to be an awesome cd. The first time I listened to it my stereo was quite low and i could barely hear it. But when i turned it up i loved it, i love it more now. It dont take time to get used to... heres a summary on it and the ratings <br /> <br />1. Vicarious 10/10 <br />2. Jambi 10/10 <br />3. Wings for Marie Pt 1 9.5/10 <br />4. 10,000 Days (Wings Pt 2) 10/10 (best song on the entire cd) <br />5. The Pot 9/10 <br />6. Lipan Conjuring 7/10 <br />7. Lost Keys (Blame Hoffman) 8.5/10 <br />8. Rosetta Stoned 10/10 <br />9. Intension 9/10 <br />10. Right In Two 10/10 <br />11. Viginti Tres 6/10 (Weakest song but great ending) <br /> <br />So anyways... i believe that everyone has their own opinions about tool, and honestly i dont care. They are a great band with beautiful songs; well crafted and anyone who is anyone should at least take the time to try to appreciate them. and whoever does will find that they are a great band
B000FIMG68|5.0|I can't understand why someone would give this show 1 star? The worst episode is still better than anything else on TV. Every episode is movie quality with exceptional acting and writing. Stephen King wrote an article in entertainment weekly stating that the show will be studied in classrooms one day and that it is the best show on TV since the Twilight Zone. That's a pretty bold statement but Lost does live upto it. <br />Surely there isn't as much character development in season 2 as was in season 1 but the second act shouldn't be about that anyway as it's time to establish the conflict and season 2 does that big time. From the capture of the mysterious Henry Gale to the mystery of whether or not pushing the button does anything this season is truly worth owning on DVD.  <br />Besides anything that is part of the killing of the reality show cannot be a bad thing.
B000FIMG68|5.0|While watching season one of Lost, I kept thinking that this could possibly be the best show ever made. The characters are very real, the underlying mystery is very intriguing, and it's just full of everything and anything that makes an excellent tv show. <br /> <br />And season two doesn't disappoint. Though we're given some answers, in return we're given more questions that keeps up coming back for more. Props to the writers for brilliant writing and good continuity. The stand-out episode for me this season is definitely \\"Psalm 23.\\"
B000002JNJ|5.0|This is more \\"groove\\" but there is enough thrash metal in here. Pantera is one of the greatest metal bands in the 1990s and one of the most well known in rock . these guys really can rock hard! <br />
B000BM6AVA|3.0|When i first wrote this review i had just heard this cd and over listened to it, it is still annoying, but thats SOAD if ur gonna criticize them for one album thats more annoying than the other albums, then take all the soad albums u do have and trash them cause u really do not no wut they are heres wut i really think of them    Attack 5/5 Awesome song and the stuff that i love about them its heavy, catchy, and will blow ur mind    Dreaming 5/5 another great song same as before    Kill Rock N'Roll 4.5/5 this is one of those songs that i thought was annoying because of daron, sure hes got a irritating voice but hey he did good on this album    Hypnotize 4/5 Not as great as i first mentioned if i remember correctly but still a good song    Stealing Society 4/5 Serj proving that he is still the better singer here with an awesome dispay of vocals on the verses    Tentative 4.5/5 great song here, and a great pause when he cants \\"where do u expect us to go when the bombs fall?\\"    U-Fig 4/5 i do not like the title because i dont get it its an alright song but great screaming from serj    Holy Mountains 4.5/5 i was recently chanting this song for no apparent reason i have fallen for it its an awesome song and heavier than i remembered it    Vicinity of Obscenity 5/5 a fun, perverted and weird song what i think they specialize in, WARNING: may be very annoying to some    Shes Like Heroin 4.5/5 a different song, catchy    Lonely Day 4.5/5 the only reason this doesnt get a 5 is because its way too short 2:4sumthing no way... guys why so short?    Soldier Side 5.5/5 not only the best song on this cd, but one of my favorite songs of all time    This album is actually a darn good effort, with awesome performances from John the drummer: i say that because he is skilled if u actually listen to what he does, Shavo is an awesome bass if u can acutally hear it, Daron is a wizard on the electric and a growing vocalist as well, serj is one of my favorite vocalists not because of his unique voices and the uncanny ability to carry very long notes i rate this cd 4.5/5 because of it
B000002UAR|5.0|What can you say about the Beatles or Revolver that hasn't been said a million times already? What made John, Paul, George, and Ringo a great band was their ability to listen to all that was going on around them in every genre of music, take the best bits of each, and synthesize that into something new. They definitely do that here. They took elements of classical, soul, jazz, Tin Pan Alley, Indian classical, the avant garde, pop, and rock, smashed it all together in a way that was accessible to the public,  and paved the way for nearly all alternative rock styles of the past 40 years. Forget what you've heard about the Velvet Underground and Nico being the first alt-rock album: it was Revolver. This album STILL sounds radically fresh to me no matter how many times I listen to it, and Tomorrow Never Knows still makes the hairs on the back of my neck stand up. A classic. Like another reviewer said, this is the only band that lives up to the hype. You will STILL find 16 year olds that love the Beatles and this album especially, while so many hundreds of other bands have  been kicked to the curb and are nearly(and sometimes justifiably) forgotten. If you're a rock fan, and ESPECIALLY if you're a musician, than this is a must  own. <br /> <br />Also, special mention must be made of Ringo's drumming. Ringo has been unfairly maligned as a drummer over the years. He was not a technical drummer, but he had incredible feel and creativity, and that is definitely in evidence all over this album, especially on Taxman and Tomorrow Never Knows.
B000F39MAQ|3.0|I think that this couple are over-hyped. <br />First:  Although i normally like modern productions, this is a modern production that is modern in the sense of a curved wall as a set with no character.  A bare set can be wonderful in some operas but in this opera it is bland. <br /> <br />Netrebko is beautiful but she has a bigger voice than many a violeta and it has quite a thick sound.  Her acting is very basic and i could not tell that she was ill or dying.  From beginning to end their appears to be no change in her appearance. <br /> <br />Villazon is a tenor i admire very much.  His Don Carlos DVD was wonderful.  However, when i watch him in this i think of a tenor and not Alfredo.  The voice is beautiful but i did not believe in him. <br /> <br />Overall a nice performance of this great opera.  However, if it is heart-breaking drama you want then look elsewhere.  The very best La Traviata available is the one from Aix-en-Provence with Delunsch.  In this we have a great soprano who acts many a violeta off the stage.  An excellent Alfredo and a model Germont.  Again a minimalist set but with purpose.  This is one of the best opera DVDs around and it is heartbreaking to watch.  A must see!
B00008HCCF|5.0|some of your reviewers are correct about here being nervous and voice getting lost....who cares! On a decent stereo with 5.1 capabilities the sound of music and here voice for a live concert is phenomenal. I paid $14.00 and it was worth every penny!
B000021YQV|5.0|Sheer brilliance is what i can say to this cd... i dont know where they came up with this but i praise them for it... this cd is the reason i like soad.
B000002UB3|5.0|Many people, critics included, believe that this, their last real studio album, is the best overall album the Beatles released.That's impossible to say, as it's all subjective, but what I will say is that many bands would KILL to write an album that is this varied stylistically, yet consistent. Simply put, there's not really a bad track on here, though personally I don't care to listen to I Want You(She's so Heavy) all that much. Definitely the highlight is the legendary medley on what used to be side two back in the days of vinyl, starting from track 9 and ending at track 17. That alone, is worth the price of this album, and is what caused so many millions of us to spend  hours with our heads practically stuck in the speakers. It's seamless, and climaxes with one of the most ungodly guitar guitar jams in rock n' roll, The End. Also a  highlight is George's gorgeous ballad Something. It is widely considered to  be the best thing he ever wrote by many, and with good reason. Gorgeous melody, with George's signature graceful lead guitar, and perfect drumming from Ringo.Overall, the whole band is just inspired here, from the songwriting to the actual performance. This was not the last album the Beatles released. Instead they chose to go back and salvage what they could from the incoherent mess that were the sessions for what came to be Let It Be. However, this would've been a far better way for the Beatles to go out. Absolutely brilliant, and an essential album.

B00007E8V4|4.0|This may not be their best cd... its still very good, and the most swears with a count of like 46 f words in the entire cd... F the system having 21 of them. They are a great band with the capabilitys of making incredible cds (even better than toxicity and Mezmerize)
B000002UA9|4.0|This is where it all started. Recorded in one day, this is the Beatles live and raw. The goal was to capture whatever the Beatles had that was driving Liverpool kids nuts at the Cavern, and I would say they succeeded. This is not the slick, well-produced Beatles that would come later, this is the sound of  a young rock n' roll band that had been slugging it out in Hamburg clubs that most sane people would be scared to death to even go in. However, what's most striking considering the year this was released (1963) is that the majority of the songs here were written by Lennon and McCartney. That just WAS NOT done in those days. Most rock n' roll bands in those days were forced to rely on outside writers or covers of songs that were already hits for other artists.  The originals already show glimpses of what the Beatles were to prove themselves capable of later.Please Please Me is justifiably considered their first classic, Misery shows what an excellent rhythm guitarist John Lennon was and the guitar style that would define their \\"mop top\\" era, and McCartney's famous \\"One Two Three FAH!!\\" countdown at the beginning of  I Saw Her Standing There is quite possibly the coolest opening to a rock n' roll album ever.  All in all, a great early 60's rock n' roll album, and ESSENTIAL if you want to understand just where the Beatles were coming from and why they were so unique.
0316172324|5.0|Now that I reflect on this book, I think that the central message that it conveys is common sense: if you have deep expertise in a particular domain, then the snap judgments that you make in that domain may give you as good or better results than any amount of analysis. Even so, the book is still a very enjoyable read - the anecdotes that Gladwell uses to illustrate his points are each entertaining in their own right. I recommend the book as a good diversion, and as a source of interesting anecdotes across a range of topics (attributes to watch out for in assessing the likelihood that a couple will stay together, leading without micro managing, understanding the entire range of factors that influence purchase decisions (new coke), when to be wary of your intuition, etc.).
B0007Y4TVU|4.0|an impressive cd here... with great material. It opens with The intro to soldiers side (which is later released on hypnotize) then byob... which i believe is their most reconized song next to prison song. Revenga i didnt care much for but still good. Cigaro is great, i have memorized it. Radio/Video is catchy but kinda dumb. This Cocain Makes Me Feel Like Im On This Song... long title, wierd, fit for hypnotize (they need a little more serj on there anyways). Violent Pornography: I believe it states a good point. Question? its a good skateboarding song, and another good point (awesome song). Sad Statue states a point about the rise of the media (like most songs) and how this generation is growing without respect at all Great song. Old School Hollywood: i do not know why they even put on this song. ITs like an attempt at techno gone wrong. I dont think its even fit for hypnotize. Lost in Hollywood Brilliant song... the best on the entire cd and a great closer, and yet another great point it proves very clearly.  <br /> <br />I recomend this cd for anyone who is willing to appreciate the immaturity, but maturity of this band which is expressed very clearly here
B000FBGBPC|4.0|LOVE THE CD, ROCKS HARD BUT DEPRESSING LYRICS. HOPE SOMEDAY MR. GONTIER HAS SOME HAPPINESS IN HIS LIFE SO HE CAN WRITE A HAPPY SONG. BUT I GUESS THAT'S THE MUSIC OF TODAY, NOBODY HAS ANYTHING TO BE HAPPY ABOUT, JUST THE MILLIONS IN THEIR POCKETS. OH WELL AT LEAST WE STILL HAVE GODSMACK. CHEERS!
B0007P3582|1.0|Used to be that a person had to have at least one aesthetically pleasing attribute to make it in the music biz, even if it was just a pretty face. No longer, apparently, at least when it comes to gangsta rap. The sure ticket to success in this warped world of terminally adolescent boy-men is \\"street cred\\"--that volatile mix of thuggish menace, oversexed misogyny and contempt for societal norms. A few scarred-over bullet holes are the gold standard, with jail time giving an extra boost.  <br /> <br />By such accounting, 50 Cent is a gangsta rap god. The self-confessed one-time crack dealer was once shot nine times during a drug turf war. Tiring of that, he tried the rap scene and hit it big in 2003 with Get Rich or Die Tryin'. In the intervening two years he's been wildly successful at the first half of that titular equation and has managed to avoid the second--barely. Now comes The Massacre, selling 1.14 million copies its first week and rocketing to No. 1 on Billboard's album chart (and staying there for a month). Two cuts from the album, \\"Candy Shop\\" and \\"Disco Inferno,\\" currently reside in the single chart's Top-10.  <br /> <br />The album is pure thug, and 50 Cent--\\"Fiddy\\" as he's often called--intends that to be a good thing. Liner photos have him pointing a large-gauge shotgun directly at the camera--it seems about a millimeter short of being a full-blown grenade launcher--while posing in a room full of firearms. Another image depicts a drive-by hit, with Fiddy leaning out a car's passenger window, a firearm blazing in each hand; a partner leans out the opposite window to fire a shotgun over the car's roof.  <br /> <br />Obscenity-laced songs such as \\"I'm Supposed to Die Tonight,\\" \\"Ski Mask Way\\" and \\"Gunz Come Out\\" reinforce the lawless image, as does a duet with Eminem called \\"Gatman and Robbin'.\\" (Gat is hip-hop slang for gun, as in gatling gun.)  <br /> <br />Only a couple of tracks show even a glimmer of conscience. \\"A Baltimore Love Thing\\" hauntingly dissects the love/hate relationship between a junkie and heroin--told from the drug's point of view. And in a rare moment of self-reflection on \\"I'm Supposed to Die Tonight\\" 50 Cent expresses doubt about whether he's \\"God's child\\" or \\"Satan's angel.\\"  <br /> <br />Remember, it's all about street cred. Gotta move those CDs, you know.  <br /> <br />
B000007T1M|4.0|Only because its the first, but still an awesome first cd... i understand that the first is supposed to be the ice breaker for a line of brilliant cds, and this is a great example. It sets the bar very high alone with Mind, sugar, and spiders three awesome songs. Suite Pee is intense but also very calm at the same time
B000E6GBV2|4.0|I stumbled on to this band while listening to Pandora.com and was infatuated with them. They had a unique sound that I could not quite describe. However, after purchasing this album I can now describe it, they sound like a cross between Echo and the Bunnymen and Marcy Playground. In fact, that is the best description there is, because they really do sound like a cross between those two bands. It is a good album, maybe a tad brief. In fact, the best song on the album \\"Our Swords\\" clocks in at under two and a half minutes, which in effect sums up the album, it is great and short and leaves you wanting more.
B000F5GNX8|5.0|Truly, from day one of marketing this movie, through its theatrical release, and now DVD release - nothing normal is done.  It wasn't hyped up.  It didn't last long in the theatres.  It also took forever to reach DVD in a time when it seems like some DVDs are released a month or so after leaving the theatres.  Even the additional bizarreness of having it air on Pay Per View before the DVD came out (as opposed to airing 2 months after the DVD), adds to the quirkiness.<br /><br />Maybe it's because the movie itself is so unexpectedly quirky from beginning to end, full of characters your gut tells you aren't that likable, but nonetheless you like them.  They grow on you quickly from a botched burglary to an accidentally spectacular movie audition, all in the first 5 minutes.<br /><br />So goes the rest of the movie at a breakneck speed, with the occasional rewind as the narrating burglar, Downey, berating himself for failing to tell an important point of the story.  The gist of the story is this: Harry (Downey) is flown out to Los Angeles to supposedly begin research for his inadvertantly won role, tutored by a gay private detective (Val Kilmer) who works part time for the studios.  There Harry meets, Harmony, the girl he grew up with, precariously perched on the edge of a small town girl gone wrong in her running away to Hollywood.  From that point on begins the impossibly fast downhill roll of murder, plots, confusion, love, and so on.<br /><br />The thing that makes this formulaic sounding idea completely different in its spit in the wind take on cliches.  Kilmer's detective, known as Gay Perry, is not a gay stereotype.  When Harry wakes up the morning after meeting his old girlfriend, the girl in his bed isn't her, it's her obnoxious friend.  All seemingly good plans go wrong, both by the criminal element and the quasi-good guy Harry, et al.  Just as you think you're getting a handle on what's going on, it takes another twisting turn.  The ending isn't picture perfect, though some characters lives have improved, they aren't exactly where they wanted to be.<br /><br />The acting is spectacular, particularly Downey.  You cannot watch this movie and be unimpressed by his craft.  Kilmer is solid and restrained, making his character believably gay yet masculine.  You believe his Hollywood nickname of Gay Perry as more than a play on words; it might just be to remind everybody that his character IS gay and it's a non-issue for the most part.  The supporting characters all have perfect dark comedic timing.  It's one great big slap at all the overdone cliches, some of which were developed by the Lethal Weapon movies that writer and director Shane Black made.  It takes a brave director to take whacks at himself.<br /><br />All in all, a terrifically dark humored movie with no delusions of grandeur.  Plus there are little 'in' jokes, such as Indio Downey, Robert Downey's look-alike son playing young Harry.  Or an old clip of Corbin Bernson pre-L.A. Law used to identify his present time character with the convoluted past of Harmony and a movie shoot in their hometown when she was young.  Most subtle was Harry having a rather nasty injury requiring him to be prescribed a heavy duty painkiller... and the character of Harry slurringly stating that he was fine, just a little woozy, and would be completely okay after two more pills.ers lives have improved, they aren't exactly where they wanted to be.

0440237688|5.0|Both my son and & I have enjoyed this book.
B000F5GNX8|3.0|Kiss Kiss Bang Bang falls into the category of one of those movies that you just want to love. Débuting to rave reviews when it was in theatres, the film purports to be a gritty re-imagining of the Los Angeles noir film, a modern day spoof of the hard-boiled detective genre. And in all fairness, the film does deliver up some irreverent fun, and some sly, dark humor, but the wacky voice-overs, like so much else, proves just too tiresome. <br /> <br />Kiss Kiss Bang Bang also has a plot that is just so convoluted. By the end of the film you will neither care nor want to know who and what the body count is. It's not that director Shane Black isn't stylish and inventive - the film is gorgeously shot and the production design unsurpassed - but Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang ultimately turns into a film that is too flagrantly pleased with itself, so smugly love with its own cleverness, that the jokes wear thin long before the movie has ended.  <br /> <br />Robert Downey Jr. stars as Harry Lockhart, the narrator and small-time from New York City who after a spoiled robbery runs away from the cops into an audition and is mistaken for an actor. He winds up in Los Angeles for a possible acting gig as a private detective on a pulp movie. The studio teams Harry with the tough private eye Gay Perry (Val Kilmer), nicknamed \\"Gay\\" because of his sexual orientation.  <br /> <br />Harry also hooks up with Harmony Lane (Michelle Monaghan), who at sixteen left her small Indiana town to make her fame as an actress in Hollywood. He had a crush on her back then and her arrival in the City of Angeles is a portent for the fact that two unrelated young girls have just been murdered and one of their bodies shows up the a lake.  <br /> <br />The plot becomes increasingly hyper-complex, filled with shootings, corpses, and references to old-fashioned crime fiction novels. It's as though Harry is almost tempting the viewers with all the devilish plot machinations, asking us whether we have solved it yet.Robert Downey Jr. is indeed a great actor and here he looks hotter than ever, and while his character is momentarily fun, after a while, his voice over narration and silly antics just become irritating.  <br /> <br />Los Angeles viewers will certainly get a kick out of some of the stunning location work - particularly the use of Downtown and Macarthur Park for some of the main action scenes. But the violence eventually comes across as rather over-baked and the joke-fuelled and casual camaraderie between Harry and Perry often seems forced and over-written. <br /> <br />Kiss Kiss Bang Bang isn't offensive even though it's quite violent. Indeed it has a cuteness and hippness that a lot of viewers are going to like. The problem is that it's just trying too hard to be in vogue. By the third act, I'd had enough and fast-forwarded it with the subtitles on to see how it ended. Even talented actors like Downey and Kilmer couldn't save it from wallowing in its own showiness and meaninglessness. Mike Leonard June 06.  <br />
B00005JNRY|4.0|From the manufacters of Finding Nemo & the Incredibles comes a delightful & thrilling story in a world where cars speak for themselves with voice talents of the legendary Paul Newman & Owen Wilson, Owen Wilson stars as Lighting McQueen, a cocky famous race car who gets waylaid in a small Arizona town called Radiator Springs while on his way to the big race, the Piston Cup, while there he discovers the meaning of friendship. Cheech Marin, Bonnie Hunt and of course John Ratzenberger voice in this once again well done Disney & Pixar triumph, Disney & Pixar can not fail. It's exciting entertainment with the same fantasy that surrounded \\"Toy Story\\" if you seen the last 6 Disney & Pixar films continue with \\"CARS\\" Disney & Pixar make the best computer animated films
B000F0UV0E|4.0|As noted below definitely an album for older and discerning listeners.  I say I'm partial because Mark Knopfler could sing and play \\"Ring Around The Rosie\\" and I'd run out and buy it.  Really enjoy the track \\"This Is Us\\".  My wife of 20 years is also a big fan and tears up everytime she hears it.  We've kind of grown up with Mark from young rocker to current sage.  I rate it a 4, but that's pretty high because I rate it against all of his other stuff.  Saw him on the Shangrila tour last year and going to see him and Emmy Lou next Sunday in Chicago.  Don't have any of her other stuff but they sound really good together, a nice departure.
B00005AQE8|5.0|This Album Has so many good tracks. I liked Shorty Wanna Be A Thug Best. Tupac Is a lyrical geinious.
B000005RU2|5.0|This is the best live album I've ever heard.  Deep Purple is flawless in this cd.  Some songs are stretched out very long, but who cares?, Deep Purple really rocks on this album.  My favorite on here is Lazy.  Jon Lord's intro is fantastic and is a heck of a lot better than it is on the recorded version.  Buy it and make everything louder than everything else!
B000F4MLZ8|5.0|This is one of the most beautiful cds that I have ever had the pleasure of listening to. Amazing lyrics coupled with flawless acoustics. I would give this 10 stars out of 5 if I could! Pick up the album, you'll know what I mean.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|Normally, i wouldn't even bother with a review online about some band, but this is not just some band, it's the red hot chili peppers. I've heard a lot of their songs, but this cd is jam packed with complete and utter brilliance in every song. This dual disk cd was definitely worth the wait. While some CDs can only be listened to for so many times, this CD will never get old. If you haven't got this CD, shame on you.
B000002NHN|5.0|The first time I heard Loreena's music I was with my best friend at the University, ten years ago, trying to escape from the burdens of the world. He gave me a copy of \\"The Visit\\" and I loved every song. I didn't hear from Loreena again until February 2001, when I came into a music store and, by instinct, I bought a copy of \\"Book of secrets\\". This gorgeous piece of art transported me to a magical and enchanted place. It was like to be born again in some fantastic land lost between the memories of my childhood and the beginning of my adulthood as Loreena's crystal voice starts surrounding your soul in a soft and lovely atmosphere. \\"The Mummer's dance\\"-one of my favorite pieces-is strongly linked to the most important and clue moments of my life. Every time I feel in a crossroad I play this song, close my eyes and, immediately, everything comes back to its original place. <br />
B000EULJLU|5.0|This album, like all of Tool's other offerings, takes several listenings to fully appreciate. Their last album, Lateralus, took quite a while to sink in, and while I can't say that one is on par with AEnima, it's definitely a fantastic piece of work. With 10,000 Days, however, I am totally suprised at how absolutely satisfying it is. This album is everything Tool is about -- plenty of heavy riffing mixed with psychedelia with brilliant song progressions. After listening to this one for a couple of weeks I can't get those tunes out of my head, which in my book is the ultimate compliment. If you are a Tool fan you should without a doubt love this one, and even if you're not, if you like Pink Floyd or Sabbath (or even the Butthole Surfers for that matter) or any type of music that is as much cerebral as it is on an emotional level, try it out. This is a good example of genius in songwriting, no question.
B0009XT89C|5.0|This album is a MUST buy for any Jamiroquai fan. As an owner of every release to date of this band's music, I would highly reccomend Dynamite. It has a blend of Jay Kay's gorgeous funk with some rock thrown in. His new trio of African American female singers also highlight the album with their well blended vocal talents. Some songs you might want to check out from this album would be \\"Star Child\\" \\"Dynamite\\" \\"Feels Just Like It Should\\" \\"Talullah\\" \\"Seven Days In Sunny June\\" and \\"Don't Give Hate A Chance\\"
B000EQ47GS|5.0|Below is a letter from Tom Scholz posted on Boston.org regarding the remastering of this album and the follow-up, Don't Look Back, but before I get to that I have a few comments.<br /><br />I have loved this album since it's debut in 1976 and I have always felt that the last song \\"Let Me Take You Home Tonight\\" sounded different from the other songs and now the liner notes of the remastered \\"Boston\\" verify that belief.  On all of the other songs, with few exceptions, Tom Scholz played all instruments except drums.  Barry played a lead here and Fran played a bass there, but that is about it.  That is, except for \\"Let Me Take You Home Tonight\\" where Tom only played the organ.  I mention this because I remember folks complaining about \\"Third Stage\\" and \\"Walk On\\" stating that they could tell a difference between these latter albums, which noted Tom as the player of most of the instruments, and the earlier ones where Boston was \\"a band.\\"  Little did they know that it was the same method.<br /><br />A letter from Tom Scholz regarding the newly remastered Debut album and Don't Look Back!<br /><br />What the Deuce IS UP With Boston?<br /><br />  My apologies to you all for the unintentional silence about Boston activities and plans, especially concerning a reissue of the first two Boston albums. Oddly enough I was just beginning a letter like this, when that topic jumped onto my computer, forcing me to drop everything, including communicating with all of you.<br /><br />  So now you know I do see postings on these sites!  Not all of them, but enough to know your collective feelings about Boston, and btw, thank you.<br /><br />  Even though half of what I read is dead wrong and the other half I disagree with (you knew I was hard to please...), it's really gratifying to know that so many people appreciate this music and the  message behind it. Those of you who just write to say encouraging things, please believe that you have saved me from giving up many times!<br /><br />  So, after the 2004 Boston tour ended, I set about recording some new material. Some of it sounds more like old Boston, some sounds more like later albums, all of it has me excited. Unfortunately I was hampered from working effectively in the studio by complications from a back injury in 2003.<br /><br />  It seems I may have been the victim of something my doctor referred to as acetaminophen poisoning. I used Tylenol regularly on and off the tours for some time, and as I have since read about, this apparently may have wreaked havoc with the health of some important organs. No, I don't mean the Hammond or the pipe organ, I mean mine.<br /><br />  Fortunately I'm now doing much better and back to full strength, and full speed in the studio...OK, I know what you're thinking, just keep it to yourself!<br /><br />  I had to hold up recording for a couple of weeks last year for some overdue studio repairs; three months later I was nearly finished soldering, drilling, and banging when I discovered the announced Sony Legacy Boston reissue on line. (Funny how ex-band members who haven't played in Boston for 25 years knew about these plans ahead of time...) I was mildly surprised to find out that two albums embodying all of my writing, performing, producing and engineering work from the 70's had been \\"remastered\\" by someone I didn't know, with added live recordings mixed by someone else I didn't know, and I hadn't even heard it! When I finally did hear it, I wished I hadn't.<br /><br />  Although I got used to getting screwed royally by business types in the music world, the audacity of this particularly inconsiderate liberty with my art got my attention very quickly.<br /><br />  Although I was pretty sure there had been a violation of my rights using the name Boston for this abomination, I decided to try the diplomatic, peaceful approach, averting another war and creating something really valuable in the process: A comprehensive remastering of the two oldest albums to bring the old mixes up to the standards of 21st century recordings.<br /><br />  Fortunately my real manager did a great job of quickly getting Legacy to see my point of view, and change their plans.<br /><br />  Now I know there are those of you who would go out and spend good money (oxymoron) for anything that says \\"new unreleased Boston,\\" but before you go off on me for committing new releasus interuptus, I want you to know you owe me BIG TIME! The so called new material consisted of two Philly KBFH (despite what you may have read elsewhere) not-our-best-night renditions of Smokin' and FPLY/LT, plus a trashy discard I used to toss in on the first tour 'cause we didn't have enough music for a full set! They didn't even have the name right!<br /><br />  These \\"bonus\\" track mixes were obviously not made by Boston. Hearing the huge stereo Boston mix style suddenly disappear when the live cuts started was a little scary (even our live sound is carefully mixed in wide stereo, as most of you know first hand). But the real kicker was a technical problem with Brad's vocal track that showed up as a very distracting constant, weird phasing.<br /><br />  And that wasn't the worst part: the studio recordings were just transfers to digital using the same EQ moves I prescribed for mastering them 30 years ago when everything had to be done manually, and not very precisely by modern standards. Not only could I hear no improvement, the overly hot sibilant portions that were listenable on vinyl and tape were now nails-on-blackboard piercing. Anyway, if you haven't figured it out yet, I didn't like it.<br /><br />  One good thing though, thinking about live Boston made me realize I have to dig out some tapes and put together some high quality mixes of our tour arrangements; some of them were totally cool. Dude.<br /><br />  So, we got Sony to retransfer from the original stereo analogue mix tapes (not the EQ'd 2nd gen copy companies tend to use) to 24 bit digital, and went to work in Protools going over every second of those mixes til we were nearly batty. It took Bill Ryan and me eight straight LONG days of work, which btw was precisely when I was supposed to be in the FL Keys celebrating my birthday. Finally we made the final adjustments with Toby Mountain at Northeastern Digital, then I joined Kim Hart and Gary Pihl working on the photos and booklet layout revisions. I think you'll like the new pics.<br /><br />  Somewhere in between I wrote a little bit about the famous demo and the making of the first album I call \\"Make Extra Money Working at Home in Your Own Basement,\\" and also clarified and expanded the credits sections. David Wild of Rolling Stone fame also wrote an excellent piece from a fan's perspective for each album.<br /><br />  But the exciting story is what you're going to hear when you put this CD in your player. The difference is amazing to me. The guitars jump out of the speakers on those power chords, Brad's voice is full and warm in the mix like it should have been, the bass is tight and now you not only hear it, you feel it! I never liked these old mixes on 16 bit CD; now they sound great.<br /><br />  Hopefully most of you will listen to this directly from the CD, not an MP3! Don't get me started....Now exactly when that will be possible via actual release Sony is not saying, but they were in enough of a hurry to ruin my b-day vacation, so presumably it will be very soon. Most recent rumor: mid May.<br /><br />  Btw, lest you think I'm trumpeting here to get sales up, be assured Brad and I don't get treated any better financially from this than we did form the original release. You don't think that just because we wrote it, performed most of the tracks, and produced it we get most of the money do you?<br /><br />  But it was worth taking the time for this. I've always wanted to make those albums sound good on CD, and the chance arrived.

B000C65Z1G|2.0|We found this movie too long for the story line.  It was a typical who done it.  It was hard to hear what some of the actors were saying.   Overall, boring.
0316921173|2.0|This book is way too much, in almost every respect. I say almost because there is one respect lacking, which is Quality, with a Robert Pirsig capital Q. There are plenty of pages, words, descriptions, drugs, inane ramblings, and just about anything else under the sun you might identify with a book that is, at last count, going absolutely nowhere in a very verbose way. This is the epitome of not having much to say and taking a long, long time to say it. Very late 20th Century America, to be sure.  <br /> <br />I read 200 pages, give or take. These 200 pages represent roughly the equivalent of most full-length novels, given that the average DFW page contains about 500 words. The thing still had 800 pages to go, plus footnotes. In a world teeming with books screaming to be read, a 1000 page, small-print book with little direction has no room to stand in my world, let along sit on my lap and take up valuable reading time. As it is, I wasted far too much time reaching page 200, a task I deem Herculean yet foolish at the same time. Why did I not stop at 100? I cannot answer that question. <br /> <br />The book appeared to be headed for points unidentified at around, oh..let's say page 2. I stuck it out, opting to see if it would eventually go somewhere. That's like standing next to a dead elephant wondering if that, too, will go somewhere. I assure you that no amount of time spent staring at its lack of movement will make a difference. Do yourself a favor and walk away from this particular elephant, lest you become irate and throw it at someone. This thing could really hurt a person if you were inclined to do something like that. <br /> <br />I obviously don't have anything good to say about this book. In trying to understand people who might like it (since it does have a 4 star average rating after all), I can only venture a guess that young, not-especially well-traveled readers do? Some lost segment of Generation X which never woke up to realize that the world is more than Dave Eggers and Douglass Coupland? Blind People? <br /> <br />A friend of mine once reviewed Dave Navarro's album Trust No One by saying that the potential buyer would be wise to heed the title of the album. Likewise, you can use this same sentiment when standing in the bookstore contemplating the purchase of Infinite Jest, because in the end, you'll wonder if the joke is on you.
006056251X|4.0|What can you say about kleypas but that she is a great author.The hero was to die for, handsome, a little on the devil side and then we have the heroine evie who i really liked - that sweet, shy attitude by with some spirit to stand up to Seb. They were great together. Out of all the Wallflower books this was my favorite one. And don't forget about the ending -Wow to say the least, I dont want to spoil it for you but the part about the (ring) was just perfect! Well worth the cover price and more.
B00005JNRY|3.0|The premise for this tale is not dissimilar from other Pixar/Disney pictures.  The plot begins with at the Final race that will determine who is the best of three cars and the winner of the much touted Piston Cup: 1.  The current champion in his last race; 2. The one who has always been a step behind; and 3. the young rookie in his very first season.  The race unconvincingly ends in a 3-way-tie partly caused by the rookie's (Lightning McQueen) cockiness.  The result is another race in California, winner take all.  The story finally gets moving when Lightning gets separated from his trailer (MACK), and sentenced to repairing the road in a sleepy town off old Route 66. <br /> <br />This moving is a far cry from Finding Nemo and The Incredibles that involved parent/child relationships, but it holds its own.  Lightning must learn that his cocky attitude and always wanting to work alone has left him searching for \\"an empty cup\\".  There are also some great characters to meet along the way.  Tow Mater is a dim-witted tow truck that likes to go \\"Tractor-Tipping\\".  Sally, a sleek and sexy Porsche Carrera, owns the local motel.  Doc Hudson the local town judge has some secrets of his own. A hippie VW van and an old WWII era Army jeep add a running joke.  Unfortunately, we never quite feel that Lightning has learned his lesson until the end.  Most of the characters don't ever truly worm their way into your heart. <br /> <br />Visually, this movie is breathtaking. During some scenes it is nearly impossible to tell that you're watching an animated film.  The race sequences are heart stopping.  And one event as a forgotten town lights up in the glorious neon glow of 40 years ago will leave many parents smiling.  Also, everything in this movie is related to cars:  there are flying VW bugs instead of flies; the cars do the \\"wave\\" by revving up and flashing their headlights; characters go \\"tractor-tipping\\" instead of cow tipping, and drink oil at the local drive-in diner. <br /> <br/>Parents should know that some of the scenes are intense and several of the Chrome and Fiberglass extras are violently taken out of the scene and crunched, though none seem to be seriously injured.  Talk to children about why Doc Hudson believes that Lightning is after an empty cup, and ask what the difference is between the ways \\"yeah, okay\\" is said and what they mean.  What did Lightning really learn from all this?  Parents may also want to talk to their children about Historic Route 66 and its impact on the Country.   <br /> <br />If you're looking for a good film, with flashy effects and a catchy sound track then this is it.  If, like me, you love all things Disney, then see this as an appetizer for Pirates.  And make sure you stay through the end of the credits. <br />
B000E6UK5K|1.0|David Gilmour has made a living singing other people's songs.  Plus, he plays guitars on them....sorta like a session musician.  The problem is that when he isn't teamed up with somebody who can write GOOD songs for him, we have something very boring....like this album.    Gilmour became famous by singing and playing guitar on songs written by a man named Roger Waters.  Gilmour was extremely lucky in that (1) Roger Waters was a genius song-writer, (2) Roger Waters let Gilmour sing many of the songs, and (3) Roger Waters shunned the limelight which allowed casual Pink Floyd fans to actually think that Gilmour had something to do with the songs....other than sing them.      Back in the early 1980's Roger decided to stop supporting the three welfare ho's that were his bandmates in Pink Floyd and split up the band.  With nobody to write songs for him, and knowing that he really had no talent, David Gilmour did what all true rock n rollers do when they desperately need some creativity....he got his wife to write songs for him.  As anybody knows who has seen the movie Spinal Tap, which was inspired by the life and times of David Gilmour, getting the wifey to write songs for you is a real bad idea.  This album makes that point ....very strongly.  Imagine John Lennon saying to Yoko, ....got anything for me to sing, Yoko?\\"  I don't think so.    The songs on this particular Polly Samson album have nothing to take note of.  They are VERY boring.  Any person who takes a Music 101 class at the local community college could come up with songs like this.  Nothing creative, nothing edgy, nothing inspiring....just slow, wandering guitar doodlings by an extremely uninspired guitar player.  The lyrics of course are laughable.  One wonders how they could be that bad.  Do they even try to write lyrics better than Brittney Spears?  Did they try to insult us with the inanity of this stuff or do they think we all mentally shallow?    However, one must give David Gilmour some credit.  At least with this collection of boring songs he didn't call it \\"Pink Floyd\\" like he did in his last two solo efforts, A Momentary Lapse of Reason and The Division Bell...which were also terrible albums.  However, if Gilmour wanted to be totally truthful, he would call this a Polly Samson album.    The fact is that David Gilmour has not written a single song that has become famous.  All the songs that have become famous by Pink Floyd...the ones you hear on the radio....the ones that have made huge crowds jump up and applause....all THOSE songs were written by Roger Waters.  Gilmour is reduced to arguing that he was important to THOSE songs because he played the guitar and sang.  However, a 1000 cover bands can do the same thing.  However, it takes a genius to CREATE genius work.  Polly Samson or David Samson or Polly Gilmour or whatever....doesnt have what it takes.    This album wont exactly make any fans for David Gilmour.  But, Gilmour doesn't need any new fans.  He will continue to make serious cash off of the legions of old-time Floyd burnouts and new-time Floyd nerds that would buy anything from Gilmour...including him simply dragging his fingernails across a chalkboard (which would be more interesting than this album).    On An Island is as similar to The Wall or Dark Side Of The Moon or other Roger Waters creations as Josef Stalin is similar to Mother Theresa.      P.S. To the reviewer who follows this review (above this one), Pink Panther type cartoons are for mental rejects and are about as retarded as it gets.  Get some help!!   Besides, Rush sucks.
0385336691|5.0|Instead of wasting your time with any of the junk that's in your local multiplex this summer, you'd be so much better off strapping yourself in for the ride of life with Jack Reacher. Taut, tense, and gobs of fun to read, this tenth outing finds our Dirty Harry of ex-Military police hired by a wealthy Manahattan man whose wife and daughter have gone missing. However, true to form there's more than meets the eye, and soon the twists start coming. If you haven't read Lee Child yet, do yourself a favor and join in on some of the best escapist fiction out there.
B000089CKH|5.0|I'm a latecomer to Nada Surf, and now I rue the lost time I could have spent replaying the songs of this excellent cd. LET GO is funny, plaintive, poignant, but not syrupy. Just when the material seems a bit melancholy, the next song is confident and upbeat.<br /><br />In other words, LET GO has got that perfect balance of musicianship, tunefulness, and structure that a pop music lover digs. I don't have a lot more to say about this band. Why waste time praising (near) perfection?<br /><br />SIDELIGHT: The iTunes genre this falls under is \\"Alternative and Punk.\\" Not. This seems like the default genre selected for contemporary rock/pop bands.
B00004RFFW|5.0|I've lost count how many times I've watched this film. Gibson and Glover are excelent but the inclusion of Joe Pesci was the stroke of genius. His \\"steak sandwich\\" monologue is a classic. It's hard to believe he became so obnoxious in future sequels. <br />If you were going to watch only one Lethal Weapon movie, this should be it.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|I was fortunate enough to see the Phantom on stage with Michael Crawford.  The pagentry, emotion and music were unbelievable - to date, I've seen nothing to compare.  I was very excited to see the movie and hear that beautiful music all over again.  I am happy to say that I was not disappointed.  The movie adaptation was excellent with the same pagentry, emotion and music.  It had a fresh new twist on the play I saw so many years ago.  I felt the casting was excellent.  Emmy's voice was beautiful and pure.  Gerald Butler's Phantom made it hard for me to understand why Christine picked Raoul.  It's true that Butler isn't Michael Crawford; nor do I want him to be.  He had his own unique style that made for a powerful character full of emotion. <br /> <br />This movie version is in my collection as a classic.  Thanks for making me fall in love with the Phantom all over again.
B000002TQV|5.0|Now, I don't own this album, but I've heard most of the songs on it. So, I'll do a track by track review on the songs I've heard.<br /><br />High and Dry:10/10 nice little pop song<br /><br />Fake Plastic Trees:10/10 i remember vividly seeing this video on much music and thinking \\"What the f*** was that s***!?\\" I thought it was so odd, that I'd never get into Radiohead, but after a few more listens, I was hooked.<br /><br />Bones:10/10 Underrated, a good rocker with odd lyrics<br /><br />Just:10/10 One of my personal favorites, the video is great and so is the song<br /><br />my Iron Lung:10/10 my favorite, very memorable riff at the begining.<br /><br />Street Spirit(Fade Out):10/10 very gloomy and beutiful song with a great riff and great lyrics.<br /><br />So, there you have it, all the songs I've heard from \\"The Bends\\". I'd buy it, but its, like, $30 dollars at \\"Play\\"(My local record store). So Ill just look for a cheaper copy, till then, Ill keep enjoying the tracks I have from \\"The Bends\\"
B00000DQSZ|5.0|The fluid percussion, and violin-like (air raid) sirens of Trans Europe Express - transfixes.  I can meditate on it (to it?) as I do a long King Sunny Ade instrumental groove.  Just some of other music that takes me to this place are:  Ultravox's desolate \\"Vienna\\"; The grande intros to several Barry White tunes like \\"I'm Gonna Love You Just A Little More, Baby\\" and the dramatic instrumentals of Cake's \\"Where would I be\\".
B0002KVUL6|4.0|I have both edition, the ultimate edition and the regular edition but the ultimate edition better than the regular edition. The first disc brings no different with the regular edition.I just thought that there will be any extra or extended scene for the movie but there was nothing.It's just the same with the regular edition. Second disc brings you more depth through the making of the film. It will brings you more specified to the locations and the characters in the film and the third disc is a dual disc, features the movie from the classic Dracula, The Wolf man and the Frankenstein. I'm glad these two disc makes me feel worth it. Highly suggested for those who still did not own Van Helsing dvd and for those who love extra features to get this edition but for those who already have the regular edition and also just want to see the movie, no need to buy this edition.
0596009208|4.0|This is a relatively easy book to read, if you have some sort of background in either math, science, or basic programming. To be fair, this and all programming books can be confusing and there is probably no such thing as a perfect book on the topic. <br /> <br />This book introduces the topics well, but not very indepth because it is meant to give the reader a good overview and some deep thinking on components that make up a java application. <br /> <br /> <br />After reading a few chapters and doing some exercises, I found that some parts still remained vague on why it did the things it did, but like previously mentioned, this book is a overview type of book. <br /> <br />The author(s) do a nice job on analogies and pictures do help in visualizing certain components. <br /> <br />I will probably need a few more books to supplement or reinforce the topics of this book.
B000003TA4|1.0|When this album came out i was about 12 or 13 years old and it was the greatest album i had ever heard.Today it is extremely lame and dated,which is why alot of people are turning against this album,it simply does not hold up.For the impact this album had you'd figure it would be a genuine classic but it's not even close,that's why people are turning against it, not because it's the cool thing to do but because the music is simply dated and irrelevent.
B00005J6UP|5.0|Now this is a film I can enjoy. The effects are way ahead of their day. The film has been restored so well that it looks as if it were made yesterday. Extremely funny and very good in the adventure department. Highly recomended.
0684824906|5.0|This is one of the best books that I have ever read.  It took awhile to get into it, but after the first 100 pages, I could not put it down.  This is a book that every manager should read and take lessons from.
B00000K3CM|5.0|This movie achived what Friday the 13th part VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan could not. I will not spoil anything if you have not seen it yourself. This film is hilarious. Very recomended.
B00000DC10|1.0|i dont quite get the hype around this album... admittedley i only listened to it a few times, but i keep hearing about it.. <br />Im probably giving it 1 star to even out all the other reviews, but yeah, i found it pretty dull really.Maybe thats just \\"punk\\" in general these days, the politixxx all seem overly simplistic or general paradigmatically reactionary/oppositional ... <br />but damn, the music is just too formulaic, but i guess each to their own style... though early punk just seemed so much more diverse...and funny ...maybe this album is diverse in regards to punk with production and genre influences, but compared to other diverging genres...i think the dogmatizing and stylistic consolidation of punk has been its undoing. <br />. i should listen to this again, but as far as being the best album of the year/decade or whatever, you guys need to listen to more music...
0780020685|5.0|This release is great, but Criterion just announced a 3 disc version of this with a BETTER video transfer!
0385504209|3.0|I start to read the book when the catholic churches sent out fliers to my door to use this book as a discussion topic.  After reading the book, i am wondering why the church would be doing marketing for a novel/thriller.  Honestly I put it down many times before Chapter 14, but after it I just wanted to read on.  Dan Brown is a  talented story teller.  But his books are not for serious readers and the literature is simply poor.  However, he made it interesting when you are walking on a treadmill, or sitting on an airplane or being bored on a rainy afternoon.  He is trying to entertain (of course making the bucks at the same time) ohter than anything else.
B00003CXCD|4.0|This is a story of a princess who is young to be performing the official duties of the Royal family but loves to experience the outside world. On the night of her visit to Rome, having disconnected from the real world for long, she slips away from her residence. During this little adventure she meets an American news reporter named Joe Bradley (Gregory Peck.) Audrey Hepburn offers great performance as a naïve young woman who wants to be a common person away from the pageantry she is used to. It is a sheer luck that Hepburn was cast for this role. After she auditioned for the movie, a brief chat with director William Wyler convinced him that she is the best for the job. No one has ever regretted this decision as Hepburn went on to win the Academy award. Hepburn is a natural, and remains at ease in her portrayal as a princess enjoying the real world. No wonder Academy awarded the biggest prize in Hollywood even though she was novice to a Hollywood film and this is her first movie.  Originally Cary Grant was offered the lead role but casting Gregory Peck was not the best decision one could have made. Peck has made great movies but he does not shine in this film. Shooting of the film in and around Italy adds depth to the story of movie. The princess taking a ride with Bradley in a Vespa motor scooter is an iconic symbol of American cinema. Anyone who has seen the other movie of Hepburn; Breakfast at Tiffany's could see some similarities in the story of these two films as she play a free spirited woman who doesn't know what she really wants in life. The movie was written by a Hollywood Blacklisted author Dalton Trumbo who did not get credit in the original movie but the DVD released later gives credit he really deserves.
B000A59PMO|5.0|I've never seen an episode of VERONICA MARS on television.  It airs on the UPN.  I don't think people near the age of 40 (like me) are allowed to watch that network.<br /><br />After hearing my neighbor, a colleague and a relative talking about the show all in the same week, I decided I needed to buy Season One on DVD.  The pilot was cute enough, with clever plot twists and some satisfying resolutions to the conflicts that arose.<br /><br />TV series tend to do one of two things following their pilots -- they get worse or they get better.  Very few seem to be able to accomplish the latter.  VERONICA MARS is one that actually continued to get better throughout the entire first season.  Characters developed, plots became more compelling, and the writers seemed to find a rhythm that really works for the show.<br /><br />Any while it does deal a lot with the angst of teenage life (high school, boyfriends, popularity, and so on), it also deals with far more adult subjects like rape, coping with death, abandonment issues and single parenting.<br /><br />Each episode has Veronica solving little mysteries for friends or schoolmates, but running throughout the entire season are questions about who killed her best friend Lily, and what happened to Veronica's mother, who disappeared shortly after Lily's death.  These season-long story arcs owe a lot to shows like ALIAS and 24, and they keep VERONICA MARS nearly as compelling as those shows.<br /><br />So even if you think this is a \\"teenage\\" show, I'd recommend that you give it a chance.  You'll be surprised!
B00004Y6NX|1.0|Making movies is such a bore.I fell of to sleep just after the second song.Dire straits are very overrated as they produced only one good song in SULTANS OF SWING.Rest of their albums are boring.Avoid this BOREFEST and buy STICKY FINGERS from THE ROLLING STONES instead.
B000002UB3|5.0|The Beatles were/are the greatest band ever.  They are a perfect example of the whole being more than the sum of it's parts.  While McCartney, Lennon, Harrison, and Starr all recorded great music after the Beatles, none of them reached the heights of THE BEATLES.  This is their final record together and if this is the sound of a band breaking up, more bands should try it.  \\"Abbey Road\\" is the second best Beatles album, in my opinion, right after \\"Revolver\\".  This record has something for everyone, \\"Come Together\\", \\"Something\\", \\"Maxwell's Silver Hammer\\", \\" Oh Darling!\\", \\"Octapus's Garden\\", \\"I Want You (She's So Heavy)\\", \\"Here Comes the Sun\\", \\"Because\\", \\"You Never Give Me Your Money\\", \\"Mean Mr.Mustard\\", \\"Polythene Pam\\", \\"She Came In Through the Bathroom Window\\", \\"Golden Slumbers\\", \\"Carry That Weight\\", \\"The End\\", and Her Majesty\\".  This is a masterpiece. \\"And in the end, the love you take is equal to the love you make.\\"
B000050HTO|5.0|Bob Dylan is most certainly amongst the best singers of all time with more than 20 platinum albums and superb songs like BLOWIN IN THE WIND,LIKE A ROLLING STONE and SLOW TRAIN COMING.Pay no attention to the one star fool below me and get this classic.This collection is good so get it.
B000002KD9|5.0|Canada's answer to Bob Dylan is famous for experimenting with not only different styles of music - but entirely different genres. It would be simple if he was crap at one type and brilliant at another, but it isn't that simple with Neil. He's had strong sales and critical approval/acclaim with them all, so deciding his greatest studio or live achievement is made all the more difficult. There is the album that created grudge music (E.K.T.I.N.), his most popular and best folk album (Harvest), his most underrated rock album (Zuma), his unique tilt at the blues (On the Beach), the acoustic and electric bliss of the live Rust Never Sleeps, his deep and contemplative country skits on Tonight's the Night and so on. But all are aquired tastes and cannot be definitively ranked above another.  <br /> <br />However, every fan of Neil Young recognises that ATGR has a certain lure: maybe just one or two songs are memorable to them, but aren't enough to constitute Young's best piece of music in their opinion. But with these opinions combined, and the fact that no album before or since has summed up Young's emotive techniques and delivered them in perfectly in every way, therefore no Neil Young fan can truly deny After The Gold Rush's status as the quintessential chronicle and the go-to album for any aspiring fan.
0671027387|5.0|This was an amazing novel.  Dan Brown has become one of my favorite authors and I can't wait until he comes out with more novels.  Deception Point is a book you won't want to put down once you start it.  I finished it in about 3-4 days and I didn't want it to be over.  I have read Angels and Demons and The Da Vinci Code and am going to read Digitial Fortress soon.  I recommend this book to anyone who has read a Dan Brown novel before or likes scientific, fast-paced, action suspense novels.
B000B5XOSO|4.0|The sequel to the groundbreaking original takes the Batman series to another level. What's so intriguing about this film is that it has a personality and style far more intense than its predecessor. It has its own flavor. Batman (Michael Keaton) tries to piece together the ambitions of the mysterious Penguin (Danny DeVito), and the sexy, sultry Catwoman (Michelle Pfheiffer), and keep Gotham City streets safe. The Christmas season flows with an aura of darkness, thanks to Tim Burton's visionary direction, and the movie just flows smoothly. Keaton gives another solid performance as the caped crusader, DeVito is great as Penguin, and Pfheiffer is scorching in that cat suit. Some fans were disappointed in how the atmosphere's a little different in \\"Batman Returns\\". There's no wild parade, no Joker, no Prince songs. But fans who really appreciate an interesting drama mixed in with breathtaking action will love \\"Batman Returns\\". This new special edition of the film does it some justice, remastering it in high-quality and packing in some interesting documentaries on the second disc. A must-buy for Batman fans.
B000BVQ9JO|5.0|i am obsessed with their new cd.  it's a must have!!!
B00007FOMP|5.0|As a total peice this is clearly Marvin's Master piece and if you love soul music then this is a must for your collection. If your rating this with a one star then your probably in the wrong music section. (As a side note not many know that Curtis Mayfield... Marvin's Lyrical superior co-wrote tracks for this album) So if you like soul you might wanna check his stuff as well.
B0000256KE|4.0|This is a fascinating album in that it is a picture of that last moment before true greatness breaks... The change that happened shortly after this album release to usher in the greatness was - Brian Eno left the band -  and both parties got better in the doing. <br /> <br />Eno even admits as much, that everybody improved after the break-up <br /> <br />He was able to do his thing (Beautifully) and Roxy went on to be a more suitable pop offering under complete control of Ferry, not a bad thing, they became an example of art-pop with him at the helm and released album after album of beautiful music... <br /> <br />Eno went on to change the world (in my view) creating a musical genre called \\"ambient\\" still standing today ... <br /> <br />Both succeeded (A nice story) <br /> <br />There was a time when both Roxy Music and Eno were releasing albums simultaneously and it was staggering the power and artful skill exhibited on both records  <br /> <br />such as \\"Stranded\\" (Roxy) and \\"Here come the warm jets\\" (Eno both in 73)  <br /> <br />1974 saw \\"Country Life\\" (Roxy) and \\"Taking Tiger Mountain\\" (Eno) <br /> <br />1975 saw \\"Siren\\" (Roxy) and \\"Another Green World\\" (Eno) <br /> <br />1976 was ... Oops Roxy Music stumbled and made some live crappy album Eno released the brilliant \\"Before and After Science\\" ... the story goes on and on and I love them both and you should too.. <br /> <br />I suggest buying it all, from both Eno and Roxy (right now) you can't lose.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Madonna is probably the greatest talent in the art of sound in the last 100 years. She has changed modern music many times. Her compositional skill is beyond peer. She really cares about the music, enough to have taken guitar lessons to learn a two-chord tune a few years ago. That is dedication! Plus she diets and exercises religiously. That is the sign of a true genius. Also her book of porn was really great. But you can't find it in the same bookstores as her new children's books. So it's hard to buy all of her literary work in one place. One thing you can count on is that she will continue to redefine herself. And the press will obey. Because they know the talent and musical genius of this woman will be recognized for centuries to come.

B000AMJDHY|3.0|A well placed intermission seperates two very distinct sounds on the debut release of the Las Vegas band, Panic At the Disco!  The first 7 songs, typical of a freshman effort, is full of catchy hooks and power pop.  Unfortunately this humble beginning, while very strong in terms of radio friendliness, does nothing but travel the worn path of a thousand other bands we've heard the last few years.  If you're not looking for a sound with any staying power and just want some feel good music that will probably bore you by the end of the summer, then you'll certianly enjoy the beginnings of this emo pop(the punk label to this sort of emo truly no longer applies, if you want punk go get Art Brut's cd) album.  The low point of this beginning is 'Nails For Breakfast, Tacks For Snacks'.  This song could easily have been plucked from a Duran Duran album, which is a good thing in my opinion.  It's ruined by a horrible electronic overlay on the vocals that should've been reserved for Britney Spears and boy bands.   Following the first 7 tracks is an intermission that has no place on any record.  The piano is ok, but the techno is an extremely weak effort and you will find yourself skipping the entire track very quickly.        Finally, track 9, we get to the meat of the album.  Finally Panic at the Disco begins to realize some of the potential of the band.    I especially enjoyed the classic piano on 'But it's better if you do' and 'There's A Good Reason These Tables are Numbered Honey, You Just Haven't Thought Of It Yet'.  'There's A Good Reason These Tables are Numbered Honey, You Just Haven't Thought Of It Yet' especially, reminiscent of a latter day 'The Specials' sound, puts some creativity to what had previously been a passe and boring sound.  'I Constantly Thank God For Esteban' has a spanish mariachi style refrain that is another welcome break.  9-13 are obviously the expiremental part of theis debut release and the strongest point of the album by far.  They manage to mingle in other types of sounds without straying too far from the emo pop sound that has established the bands popularity.        All in all I find the album ok.  The latter part of the cd is all I listen to anymore, as I quickly bored of the beginning.  Panic at the Disco has some ability to be a radio mainstay for years to come if they focus on these creative strengths, but could easily fall to the wayside as so many other emo pop bands previous to them have if they fail to capitolize on it.  Instrumentally the band isn't particularily strong.  The guitar and rhythm section are good enough to be serviceable, but certainly won't wow any fans of Dream Theatre, Led Zeppelin, or Tool.        I'm looking forward to see what the sophomore effort sounds like.
B0000047EC|4.0|I have really enjoyed this beautiful CD.  It is a kind of dreamy jazz.  For those of you who were profoundly touched by BrokeBack Mountain, Annie Proulx said that the track, \\"Spiritual,\\" was an aid to her inspiration in writing the scene now refered to as the Dosey Embrace.
B000BBYMA2|5.0|this movie will keep you on the edge of your seat from beginning to end. effects excellent along with the characters acting. if you didnt think a movie can keep you on the edge think again. with twists and turns the actors take you to another place just like your really their. this movie is filled with suspence and action it will knock your socks off, it may even get to the point where you forget your watching a film. this movie is probobly mu number one favorite

B0000399WI|5.0|Once in a while a film emerges that goes beyond the mainstream, though manages to touch many hearts and minds. These films somehow give us hope, inspiration and a reason to carry on despite the obstacles thrown unremittingly across our paths. They show us that the human being is capable of enduring great suffering yet can push through this suffering and shine like never before. The Shawshank Redemption is one such film.<br /><br />Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) has been tried and found guilty for the murder of his wife and her lover. His sentence is two life terms and is sent to Shawshank prison to do his time. Andy is innocent though he seems to take this disaster in stride. Andy is an unusual character. He is a man of great intelligence and patience, a man with a basic goodness that shines forth despite the horrors that befall him. He is a man of great humanity and never ever loses hope because he holds fast to those simple aspects in life that define our humanity. In the scene where he risks his life to help the sadistic Captain of the guard (Clancy Brown) by showing him how he can avoid being taxed with his inheritance, all Dufresne asks for in return is two cold beers for each of his \\"work associates\\". Why does he do such a thing? Red (Morgan Freeman) comes to the conclusion that the act simply made him and his fellow prisoners feel more human. And that's exactly what happened.<br /><br />Morgan Freeman as Red narrates the story about Andy and their relationship with an almost undefinable heart. I truly believe Freeman is one of the best \\"voice-overs\\" in cinematic history. His resonate and wise voice pulls the viewer into the tale making the story feel real and significant. Freeman makes us listen because what he's saying is true and we hold on to every word because we know we'll learn something. Morgan Freeman is one of our greatest actors.<br /><br />Taken from a novella by Stephen King, \\"Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption\\", director and writer, Frank Derabont, also the screenwriter of The Green Mile, ensured the film was carried by the acting and nothing else. The soundtrack is beautiful, but it is Robbins and Freeman, including the entire cast, that makes this film an extraordinary one.<br /><br />As has been written and said many times almost too numerous to mention, The Shawshank Redemption is about hope, it also is about friendship, patience and endurance. In this round, somehow, against all odds to the contrary, good triumphs over evil. And it is done with such flair, elegance and real justice, that most of us coming away from the tale are left almost dumbfounded: how did Andy do it?<br /><br />These are good men in appalling conditions, where most would fall and become part of the evil. Here is a story about a man who holds fast to his integrity, cares about his friends and pushes against unspeakable conditions to, at last, come through to the other side with his humanity in tact.<br /><br />The Shawshank Redemption is a remarkable film.Derabont, also the screenwriter of The Green Mile, ensured the film was carried by the acting and nothing else.

B000301YY8|3.0|Not a great album, quite frankly, it's just average.  The song 'Your Beautiful', although simplistic, indicated that he might be capable of some interesting variety on his album.  Unfortunately, this isn't the case.  Some of the songs are very derivative of other bands/songwriters without injecting his own flavor into it.  For example, the song 'So Long Jimmy', which is apparently a 'tribute' to Jim Morrison (and perhaps also is an attempt to trade on his passing resemblance to Jim Morrison)has the actual lick from the end of 'Riders On The Storm'.  That's right, not a similar lick but the actual same notes.  I'm disappointed by the album because I have the feeling something really quite good could have happened here, but it didn't.

0553106635|3.0|These books are addictive, or I would not still be reading them, but IMO, the series has a number frustrating faults. On one hand, Mr. Martin can write chapters that are downright brilliant and are as good as any fantasy I have read. Most of the characters are well drawn with a sly sense of humor that can make me laugh out loud. Mr. Martin has a fertile, original imagination.<br /><br />On the other hand....<br /><br />After almost three thousand pages of reading, I am convinced that these books are intentionally padded with fluff that even Mr. Martin's considerable ability cannot sustain. Some scenes are bloated like a wordy first draft that was never edited.  The ability to write economically and move the plot along without unnecessary detail is not one of the author's strengths.  Characters have circular arguments that go on and on, even though the outcome is obvious. This kind of thing happens so often that it's got to be an end in itself.  These books are designed to be loonnnngggg, to bulge on bookstore shelves. I thought  \\"Storm of Swords\\" was better in this respect than the previous two volumes, but there were still segments I found just plain boring and needlessly over written at the expense of other plot lines.<br /><br />The way that most characters lose out most of the time in this series is a bit depressing and makes me wonder if the author was dealing with some personal demons. It's like a detective novel where the hero inevitably gets beaten up at the beginning, so pay back is sweeter in the end.  Well, there's been thousands of pages of \\"beaten up,\\" with very little \\"payback.\\" Also, there's been little romantic love or sex in this series, while there's been quite a bit more sex that's been either forced or paid for.  Why?<br /><br />Much has been made by some reviewers of the author's \\"inventive\\" killing off of main figures or radically changing their characters, or changing plot direction in this volume.  I just found this capricious and undisciplined. It's like Martin grew tired of some of his characters or didn't quite know what to do with them, or just had too many to deal with, so he bumped some of them off.  While this was done within a plot context, it had the air of simple authorial execution rather than really being plot driven.<br /><br />From the get go, I believe Mr. Martin has spent his writing day focusing on whatever he felt like. He introduces characters or locations that are quickly dropped for no apparent reason, yet he spends an inordinate amount of time on trivial behavior of other characters.  I really think he is making this stuff up almost as he is typing it. If he has any kind of overall vision for the arc of the plot, it appears to change all the time. This mutability is not the imitation of reality, it's authorial self-indulgence. (I am tempted to call it laziness, but the guy has cranked out several thousand pages.)<br /><br />Mr. Martin is particularly effective at manipulating the reader by generating suspense through parallel plotting and cliff hangers. This suspense is often cheap or artificial.  For example, a character appears to die at the end of a chapter. It turns out later that they did not.  Anyone who was in the room when they \\"died\\" would know they didn't die, but the author has miss-represented the facts to the reader to create suspense. Yes, that's an authorial tool, but I'd call it cheesy pulp writing and not very inventive. Mr. Martin uses such crutches to keep the reader interested. If his pacing was brisker, with tighter scenes and focused plotting that has internal logic, he wouldn't need such tricks.<br /><br />Mr. Martin is very diligent at setting lots of such manipulative suspense hooks to keep the reader reading and buying more books.  It's a needed spur for the reader to get through the boring bits.  \\"Well this chapter is really dull, but I must push on to find out what happens to Tyrion in the next one.\\" \\"That last volume really dragged at times, but I've got to see if Dany gets to Westros with the dragon's in the next one.\\"  When a reader has invested thousands of pages in a storyline, it's hard to just put it down, even if it is sometimes dull, especially if the author keeps hatching more intriguing plots than he ever resolves.<br /><br />I have read that there is a rumor that this series will end at six volumes.  Given the pace of plot development, I'm not sure Martin can or wants to end it at only six.  A better series title might be, \\"George R R Martin's Perpetual IRA Machine.\\"imes, but I've got to see if Dany gets to Westros with the dragon's in the next one.\\"  When a reader has invested thousands of pages in a storyline, it's hard to just put it down, even if it is sometimes dull, especially if the author keeps hatching more intriguing plots than he ever resolves.  <br /> <br />I have read that there is a rumor that this series will end at six volumes.

B000EULJLU|5.0|Tool over the years has just gottin better. Saw them in Chicago and there ability is one of the best I have seen in a long time. There are some songs that could use more singing. Tracks 1,2,4,8,10 are the best. I think people would enjoy these songs a lot more if they fully understood their meaning. I give the albun 5 stars.
B0000YEEGM|4.0|I rate this movie 8/10. This movie is among the Best 1000 DVD's by Peter Travers, and won 4 Oscars in 1988, including Best Picture. Dustin Hoffman nails his character of an autistic brother of the always interesting Cruise. Hoffman got the Oscar for this performance. Cruise is in need of money, and it is all he cares about, not family, not relationships. He finds his brother by chance and tries to get part of the money he received after their father died. The movie is touching, but also funny. There is one terrific scene when Cruise stops at a shrink office to get some help, and when the nurse asks him what is the reason he is there, he says \\"My brother is autistic\\", and she asks: \\"Artistic? What is that ... ?\\" This scene is very funny, really funny. Also, when Hoffman wants 8 pieces of fish (instead of 4), Cruise finds a very easy and funny way to work that out. You have to see that for yourself. Hoffman, besides being an \\"excellent driver\\", can \\"gamble\\" really good. So they stop by Las Vegas to get some easy money and learn how to fall in love.<br /><br />It's a really good movie, very entertaining, and very interesting. Some of us have to work with autistic people and we know how hard it is to have them doing something (at least, something of what we want them to do...). Very inspiring in that sense too.
B00005MK9Y|5.0|This is my favorite album from Bob Marley and the Wailers and I own all of the Tuff Gong Albums.  \\"Punky Reggae Party\\" gives me chills when I hear the crowd sing back to him.  It's got classic tracks that many will be familiar with and quite a few that introduce new listeners to his music beyond Legend and his other greatest hit compilations.  What I truly enjoy is hearing the composition of the music with the band, back-up singers and Marley's vocals blending together and captured live.
0609610570|5.0|Without execution, companies are doomed to failure. Execution bridges the gap between thinking and action in the corporate arena.  This book is great for all levels of management.  With it, I recommend Optimal Thinking by Rosalene Glickman to maximize thinking in the workplace.  And I recommend Winning by Jack Welch, the best corporate leader during the past decades.
B000FGGE68|1.0|This movie looked like a good action Sci Fi movie.  It was not.  This movie has one of the worst scripts ever.  The acting is just horrible and the plot is not fleshed out at all.  Save your money do not buy this movie.  Though the extended cut might add some more, I still believe that nothing can save this excuse of a movie.  Equilibrium was a good movie made by the same director, so if you want the same style get that instead.
B0007MWZEK|4.0|I bought this sweeper after my friend demonstrated it for me at her house. I LOVE IT! I've been using it for several months now and have never had a problem with it. I can't believe how much time it has saved me. I have a 3-year-old and a 1-year-old who are messy eaters. I no longer have to drag out the heavy vacuum or broom and dustpan. My 3-year-old LOVES to operate the Swivel Sweeper! He cleans up after every meal!<br /><br />It also picks up the tufts of dog and cat hair left on the carpet and stairs. I love the way the Swivel Sweeper turns around even the smallest chair leg. I ADORE this product.<br /><br />In fact, I would encourage everyone to purchase one for an elderly friend or relative! It's lightweight, as easy to store as a broom, and they don't have to bend over to sweep dirt into the dustpan!<br /><br />I would have given it five stars, but it IS a bear to get the hair off of the brushes, and it is a little annoying how the top gets dusty. Overall, still a FABULOUS product!
B000002KKC|4.0|This  album is absolutely brilliant. Its not that experimental actually. This is real music. The members of Fleetwood Mac, mainly Christine McVie, Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks, have an immense amount of unfathomable musicianship. The song \\"Beautiful Child\\" is absolutely beautiful. Lindey always plays such a good guitar on the Fleetwood Mac albums. Nothing really compares to his guitar solo on \\"Go Your Own Way\\". Tusk is amazing just like all their albums.
0553801503|4.0|I was apprehensive about reading this after looking at a few unfavorable reviews.  The fact of the matter is that after having read the previous books there wasn't any way I wasn't going to read this one.  Could it be better?  Sure.  Do those of us who have been reading the series have some opinions as to where the plot should be going?  Of course.  Is the writing becoming a bit formulaic?  Hmmm.  But you know something?  In the final analysis, I read the book with greedy self-indulgence.  The story continues!~!~  And there's more to come!!!  So what's the problem?  Just tell old GRR to boot up his computer and generate another volume.  I'm ready!!  JK
B000FFJ85I|4.0|The bad reviews can be completely ignored - this is a good album, for anyone's tastes.  It must be listened to at least 3 times, tho - these songs are not immediately catchy.  So don't give up too soon.<br /><br />There isn't a song on DU that deserves less than 3.5 stars.  Even with the harsh bellowing on Kill Caustic and Affliction, those songs recover just fine.  That's the good news.<br /><br />Unfortunately, tho, there isn't a song here that deserves more than 4 stars.  Miss Murder, The Interview, Love Like Winter, The Killing Lights, 37mm... all in that 4-star range, but can't find that magical lift that made half the songs on STS instant classics.<br /><br />Overall, for an album that costs $9, you will certainly get your money's worth.  Quality, if not timelessness...
1400079179|3.0|The night before I got on a plane for my vacation I decided to pick up this book and see what all the fuss was about.  I read The Da Vinci Code over the course of a week while on vacation in Hawaii, and for the most part it was an entertaining read.  Some of the plot points were far fetched, but it moved at a fast pace and kept me interested.  Many of the the historical facts were WAAAAAAy off, but the fact that people are so stirred up over the subject matter has propelled this book to best seller status.  If you want to read this book, go for it!  Just remember that this book is a work of FICTION and that much of the history that is passed off as factual is remedial at best.  Use these pages to entertain, not educate, and you will find a much more satisfactory end result when you turn to the final page.

B0009R1T7M|5.0|I've only just discovered Sufjan, and I've been playing nothing else for the past three days. To my ears, its a truly wonderful cocktail of even parts Beach Boys (Smile/Surf's Up era), Zappa and British prog rock such as Hatfield and the North. If any of those names trigger happy musical memories (a) you're probably 40+, like me and (b) you should LISTEN TO THIS, NOW!  <br /> <br />The only very very very minor criticism is: drums and percussion. Where they are present (and some tracks manage wonderfully without), they're often lumpy and coarse. Other than this, I can only say: do me 48 states more!

B000EJ9MTW|3.0|We all know who they sound like. It's obvious where their influences come from. Let's just hope they continue to develop their sound into something further...into something that doesn't sound like a Zepplin/Sabbath mix. I agree, these guys have the potential to be stadium rock gods...but their general lack of originality just makes me want to listen to my Black Sabbath and Led Zepplin originals. Not trying to hate on them...they're just not blazing any trails. This music has been heard before. That said...they do sound good. It does rock...but it is NOT original.
B000FIMG68|5.0|The second season of LOST does not disappoint. Most television series tend to be a letdown after a while of on-the-air time. But LOST only gets better - the way the writers, directors, and everyone else involved perfectly analyzed where a cliffhanger would fit, or what this person should have in their dark, troubling past makes this one of the best dramas of this time. Sure, it may be losing viewers because of the 'no exit strategy' sort of storyline (refrence to Entertainment Weekly's LOST-centered issue), and it was up against an 800-pound 'pop'-culture star (Idol, anyone?), but the show alone has succeeded in drawing me into the crazy, spun-out-of-control franchise. I don't love LOST just because of all the cool things they sell; I'm not that gullible. I love LOST because of the meticulously written tales of redeemption and faith, of the characters with a past shrouded in mystery and uncertainty. I love LOST because of the web of mystery the writers, creators, actors, producers and more have successfully woven, trapping me inside with the sticky threads created by the mezmerizing script, stupendous actors and just the mystery of the show overall. I mean, yeah, I used to think it was stupid (since 9/11 happened and whatnot), but after watching some episodes a bit more in depth, I realized the mistake I made - the mistake of not watching this damn show! Before it's too late - buy Season 1, the boxset, rent it, watch the Season 2 reruns on ABC throughout Summer 2006 (it's kinda late to watch the reruns; some episodes already passed), and better yet - buy/rent both Seasons 1 and 2.     **Now about the DVD itself...***    Unlike the Season 1 boxset, Season 2 delves into the actual world of LOST, whereas Season 1 showed the making of the show. However, Season 2 lacks in special features you can watch again and again and still have a huge grin on your face. Aside from \\"The World According to Sawyer\\" and the UK Promo (my personal favorites), there isn't much to see in the special features. LOST connections is probably the highlight of the DVD - but provides only the slightest amount of insight for the dedicated (or addicted) viewer. And it also takes long to go through, and can be very tedious at times. But the whole \\"Orientation film\\" touch for the 7th disc was amusing at first, but got really annoying later on. I watched disc 7 first so I was afraid the rest of the discs would be like it (gladly, they weren't).     I would reccomend you buy it if you're new to the Island (if so, I would reccomend you watch Season 1 first...) or if you're a total LOSTIE and need to show off your collection to someone else.
B00021R7CG|5.0|This movie is one of my absolute favorites in the nuclear war genre.<br /><br />First, the movie does a good job in blending items from the highest level of the national command authorities to the smaller struggles faced by one B-52 bomber crew<br /><br />Second, it shows you how even the greatest planning for a certain type of disaster can always have flaws that no one counted on.  The elected President (played by Martin Landau) is removed from a position of influence when his helicopter crashes after a first wave of nuclear weapons hits the US.  The next civilian available to succeed him is the Secretary of the Interior who clearly does not have the leadership skills to lead the US out of a potentially deadly situation.  The faltering leadership of the new \\"President\\" is further re-inforced by his military aide, an Air Defense Artillery Colonel (Colonel Fargo) played by Ripp Torn who wants to pursue \\"victory\\" where none may be had.<br /><br />Third, we get to see the remarkable intelligence and good judgement of our military as the Air Force and Navy personnel outside Air Force One attempt to diffuse a bad situation.  Especially notable is James Earl Jones who plays General Allis.  James Earl Jones advocates standing down rather than continued escalation.  The integrity in his performance is true to how I believe real military personnel would react when faced with a similar set of impossible choices whose decision only yields \\"bad\\" or \\"worse\\" outcomes. You get the feeling that the crew that James Earl Jones commands from the Looking Glass plane is behind their general in their decision to follow what they believe is the right course of action.<br /><br />Fourth, the central message of the story is well told. Sometimes, all the plans, all the systems, and all the data in the world are not a substitute for human judgement. As our own military has learned the hard way, spy satellites and high tech means of information gathering are no substitute for a man on the ground with the right language skills and skills in relating to others.<br /><br />I can do without some of the sexual references made in the beginning of the movie but this is a relatively minor point when you consider all of the film's other good qualities.round with the right language skills and skills in relating to others.   <br /> <br />I can do without some of the sexual references made in the beginning of the movie but this is a relatively minor point when you consider all of the film's other good qualities.  <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />
0321334876|5.0|One of the more practical books I've read on c++. <br />Easy to read and gets right to the point. <br /> <br />The book is divided into short chapters that covers some of the less-known subjects of c++, such as explicit constructors, virtual destructors, smart pointers, slicing issues, c++ castings & inlines, compilation dependancies, private inheritance, virtual multiple inheritance, templates meta-programming, placement new overloading and STL' TR1. <br /> <br />I've been programming c++ for more than 5 years and still managed to learn new things from reading it, so I would recommand to anyone giving it a try.
014050639X|5.0|This book's pictures are based off of common nursery rhymes and in each picture you need to find someone who is hidden somewhere in the drawing. The pages have catchy little rhymes you read that indicate whom you need to be searching for. I must have read this book hundreds of times as a child and I don't ever remember becoming bored with it.
0807219533|5.0|This is a fun, wry, funny, well-drawn piece about a parallel modern London where magicians rule and magic comes in the form of controlling Demons (who prefer the term djinn). Set amidst the political intrigue is a story of a young apprentice magician and his quest for revenge. Some-time narrator djinn Bartimaeus is called forth to do half-hearted battle on behalf of the boy. This Bartimaeus is the main reason to read the book. His amusing, ironic take on events is worth your time alone. The world itself is well drawn and realized, as are all the characters. Many, who play but a bit part, have unforgettable personalities. <br /> <br />Yes there are glimpses of Harry Potter--young apprentice wizard, a world of magic where commoners are ignorant cattle--and various other genre books that have tread the same path, but it's all done with such verve and charm that it masterfully transcends its influences and hopefully will become a classic in its own right. <br /> <br />I listened to the audio-disk and was very impressed with the exceptional quality of voice acting. Simon Jones does each voice with clarity and emphasis on variation; it seemed as if a cast of dozens were reading. I would not hesitate to recommend the audio books. <br /> <br />While this is styled a \\"Young Adult\\" book, I would say most contemporary authors--in the \\"adult\\" writing camp--would be hard pressed to write one paragraph of Mr. Stroud's quality. Beware if you intend on reading this to a child: many of the vocab choices, while apt, may beguile many a young reader. All for the good, of course, since the story is exciting enough to make trips to the dictionary well worth it. <br />
B000ETRCMQ|2.0|The plot is nothing new: two people going on a road trip, discovering their inner selves while bonding, meditating on life, appreciating each other's flaws after the drama. The only twist is that it deals with a transgender human being trying to bond with his son before his surgery (coincidently, getting a phone call from him 5 days before it). Felicity Huffman did a decent and convincing job at playing Bree. It wasn't anything brilliant, however; I thought that she lacked emotion and depth, while the actor playing as Bree's son, was a bit lackluster and just confusing. Transamerica has a few amusing episodes, but i found many aspects of it very unrealistic *SPOILER ALERT!*.<br /><br />For instance, when did Bree's son all of a sudden start to fall in love with her? How could he openly reveal Bree's gender in public, humilating her and calling her a liar and freak, and then out of nowhere proclaim that he thinks that she's sexy and would marry her if he could? That was totally out of character. And many times throughout the movie, I felt that some events happened and ended so quickly (the girl in the restaurant suddenly kissing Bree's son, both of them being in the woods one night, then being in the middle of nowhere, then suddenly being in a restaurant, then at a house full of transgender people) that it seemed like a quick and easy way to get the plot moving. And although this film touched upon serious issues (drug abuse, suicide, and male prostitution), it felt a bit typical, if not predictable, that these things did happen to this family. Mainly, though, the downfall of Transamerica is that it could have been much deeper and emotional, possibly being more in depth about the life of a transgender person. The relationship between Bree and her son felt forced and stubborn to the end. And I wasn't really touched by Bree's story because we don't get that much of a glimpse of her past life before he decided to become a woman.

1400094984|5.0|This is a fun, wry, funny, well-drawn piece about a parallel modern London where magicians rule and magic comes in the form of controlling Demons (who prefer the term djinn). Set amidst the political intrigue is a story of a young apprentice magician and his quest for revenge. Some-time narrator djinn Bartimaeus is called forth to do half-hearted battle on behalf of the boy. This Bartimaeus is the main reason to read the book. His amusing, ironic take on events is worth your time alone. The world itself is well drawn and realized, as are all the characters. Many, who play but a bit part, have unforgettable personalities. <br /> <br />Yes there are glimpses of Harry Potter--young apprentice wizard, a world of magic where commoners are ignorant cattle--and various other genre books that have tread the same path, but it's all done with such verve and charm that it masterfully transcends its influences and hopefully will become a classic in its own right. <br /> <br />I listened to the audio-disk and was very impressed with the exceptional quality of voice acting. Simon Jones does each voice with clarity and emphasis on variation; it seemed as if a cast of dozens were reading. I would not hesitate to recommend the audio books. <br /> <br />While this is styled a \\"Young Adult\\" book, I would say most contemporary authors--in the \\"adult\\" writing camp--would be hard pressed to write one paragraph of Mr. Stroud's quality. Beware if you intend on reading this to a child: many of the vocab choices, while apt, may beguile many a young reader. All for the good, of course, since the story is exciting enough to make trips to the dictionary well worth it. <br />
B000002VC3|5.0|I was introduced to the Alan Parsons Project by my father via \\"Eye in the Sky\\" album.  I was in high school at the time when the title track was released.  Unlike today's parents, it was highly unusual for them, the Baby Boomer generation, to listen to current pop-rock; I thought it was really cool to have a dad who listened to what I did.  Dad was an amateur musician, who was studied music in high school and his freshman year in college.  He had a real influence on me musically and taught me what to listen for in music.  I have managed to collect most of his albums and, some twenty years later, still enjoy listening to this album.<br /><br />The Alan Parsons Project was the brainchild of producer/engineer Alan Parsons, who, in conjunction with Eric Woolfson, created an outlet for studio musicians to perform.  Each album had a subject, beginning with author Edgar Allan Poe in 1976 and ending in 1987 with architect Antonio Gaudi.  The group never toured - they just produced songs that sold millions of albums.<br /><br />With that said, you're probably asking, \\"What about the album?\\"  First off, none of his albums come close to the high quality of \\"Eye in the Sky,\\" with the exception of \\"Turn of a Friendly Card\\" (1980).  The theme of this album focuses on government control and how it affects our lives.  Parsons and Woolfson crafted wonderfully written tunes that not only adhere to the theme, but have well-constructed melodies and incredible orchestration.<br /><br />Variety - YES!  The album presents everything from full orchestrated progressive rock to techno.  The best track is \\"Silence and I,\\"  a ballad with a soaring melody and awesome instrumental orchestrated by Andrew Powell.  The syncopation between the mallets, horns and woodwinds is completely invigorating!  \\"Old and Wise,\\" the second hit off of the album, is a gorgeous ballad that begins with oboe and strings, ending in an awesome alto sax solo.<br /><br />An Alan Parsons album wouldn't be complete without an instrumental.  \\"Sirius,\\" which became the Chicago Bulls theme,  opens the album.  It is great on a headset because the instruments were recorded on different channels.  The other famous instrumental, \\"Mammagamma.\\" was adopted by the telelvision show The Wide World of Sports.<br /><br />If you haven't listened to the Project's music, this is a great place to start.  I highly recommend it!hich became the Chicago Bulls theme,  opens the album.  It is great on a headset because the instruments were recorded on different channels.

B00000DRV7|5.0|Those who are familiar with Chicago of the 1980s and beyond will likely not know the original incarnation of Chicago at all. In 1969 this music was fresh, original, and, looking back, very progressive. Some critics called this music jazz-rock fusion at the time, which the booklet included with the album explains was a marketing move. Today we know such music in all its incarnations as progressive rock.<br /><br />An amazing six of the twelve tracks from this CD were released as singles during the three years the album was on the Billboard top 100. Of the six, five had to be edited because of their length. In those days, when FM was considered somewhat \\"underground\\" because of the paucity of FM stations and receivers, FM was the only place to hear these cuts in their unedited entirety.<br /><br />Ardent fans of Chicago will recognize most, if not all, of these hits by their titles: \\"Does Anybody Really Know What Time It Is?,\\" \\"Beginnings,\\" \\"Questions 67 and 68,\\" \\"Listen,\\" \\"Poem 58,\\" and \\"I'm a Man.\\" I admit that while I recognize most of these songs when I hear them, the titles often do not match well to the lyrics. Even casual fans of Chicago would likely recognize most of these songs from the airplay they received in the late 60s and early 70s, and the airplay they continue to receive on classic rock stations.<br /><br />Some of the songs in their unedited album versions are unfamiliar. The extensive piano introduction to \\"Does Anybody Really Know What Time It Is?\\" gives the song an even stronger jazz influence than the song proper. \\"Beginnings\\" starts out like the version released for radio, but it is nearly eight minutes long on the CD, adding an extended instrumental exit that adds jazz and Hispanic elements.<br /><br />While the term jazz-rock does seem to classify much of this music, this first effort by Chicago involved experimenting with a variety of genres. \\"Free Form Guitar\\" uses heavy feedback in a style strongly reminiscent of Jimi Hendrix. Music such as \\"Free Form Guitar\\" make \\"Chicago Transit Authority\\" as experimental in some ways as the contemporary \\"In the Court of the Crimson King\\" by King Crimson, considered one of the key milestones in progressive rock.<br /><br />The last selection on this CD, \\"Liberation,\\" has riffs that feel like some of the heavier music of the 60s, and manages to be sufficiently free-form that you might wonder whether this recording was the first time that Chicago played this music in exactly this way. While there is a jazz influence in this song, it is a very psychedelic rock song.<br /><br />There are at least six versions of this CD available.  The prices vary slightly with the exception of the phenomenally expensive gold version.  You may wish to survey the versions available and their price before buying.<br /><br />The music in this album is all over the map in a way, from pop influenced songs like \\"Does Anybody Really Know What Time It Is\\" to the bizarre guitar instrumental of \\"Free Form Guitar.\\" Every cut shows the breadth of talent and ability of a group that should be considered progressive in its first incarnation. Even the pop influenced songs generally have only pop portions, with incredible layered instrumentals surrounding the pop portions. This album contains absolutely phenomenal, ground-breaking rock music, a must-have for any fan of progressive rock and cutting edge music of all eras.such as \\"Free Form Guitar\\" make \\"Chicago Transit Authority\\" as experimental in some ways as the contemporary \\"In the Court of the Crimson King\\" by King Crimson, considered one of the key milestones in progressive rock. <br /> <br />The last selection on this CD, \\"Liberation,\\" has riffs that feel like some of the heavier music of the 60s, and manages to be sufficiently free-form that you might wonder whether this recording was the first time that Chicago played this music in exactly this way.

B000CCD0HQ|5.0|The first two bonus tracks are undoubtedly from the KBFH broadcast of the gig at the Capitol Theater, Passaic, New Jersey on August 30th 1980. They sound the same as on that broadcast and, as a clincher, Billy name-checks the venue, if you listen. 'La Grange' wasn't part of that broadcast, AFAIK, so that's been dropped in from elsewhere. Ideally, I like to know exactly from where bonus tracks come, so I was tempted to dock them half a star! <br /> <br />Thanks to these reviews below, I now know that what I was listening to before on CD wasn't the mix as originally released, which is a shabby way to treat fans. I'm just retrospectively miffed: must have been so annoying for those of you who KNEW it wasn't the real deal. (Kiss did that with 'Creatures Of The Night', only the remasters sequence giving us the mix AND running order I had grown up with. I couldn't play the original CD pressing, which was easy to spot as the wrong era was on the cover, so I empathise with you long-time Top fans. Mind, I've now been a fan for 22 years, come to think of it...)
B00000DRV8|5.0|After \\"Chicago Transit Authority\\" announced to the world the existence of this wonderful rock group, the question was whether the follow-up album would be as good as their debut. The follow-up is not as good, it is better.<br /><br />In some ways this album shows a dichotomy in musical styles. Portions of the album are constructed as progressive rock. Other portions are pop or rock and jazz combinations. Some are nearly classical. Some reviews of other versions of this album hint at this dichotomy by noting what the reviewers consider to be unlistenable portions of the album. It is interesting to note that depending on the style of music the reviewer prefers, the portions considered unlistenable by different reviewers may be exactly opposite from each other.<br /><br />The CD pulls together the two albums that originally made Chicago II. Two groups of tracks make suites. Tracks 6 through 12 are part of \\"Ballet for a Girl in Buchannon,\\" and tracks 19 through 23 make up \\"It Better End Soon.\\" There are five additional tracks leading up to the first suite, and six tracks between the two suites.<br /><br />The five introductory tracks are blues-flavored rock. The fourth track, \\"In the Country,\\" may remind some listeners of Three Dog Night. The other tracks in this group have the brass-flavored sound of \\"Chicago Transit Authority\\", but muted somewhat in comparison to the former album.<br /><br />The first suite is a concept album, or side from the days of vinyl. Out of this suite came two singles, \\"Make Me Smile,\\" which peaked at #9, and \\"Colour My World,\\" for which I do not have a peak chart position. There is a lot of instrumental music in this group of tracks, and you can almost imagine these relatively short songs being one extended track, in the manner of progressive rock.<br /><br />In the group of six songs between the two suites, several are noteworthy. \\"Fancy Colours\\" has a blues-jazz opening, but about a minute and a half into the song it transitions to a lighter, nearly pop sounding and faster song than the opening. The contrast is startling and makes you think the opening is a completely separate song from that after the transition. Robert Lamm wrote \\"25 or 6 to 4\\" when he was bleary-eyed and had stayed up too late. Knowing the origin of the song, the title nearly makes sense as you realize his brain wasn't working well when he tried to see what time it was. The next three instrumentals seem to form a mini-suite: \\"Prelude,\\" \\"A.M. Mourning,\\" and \\"P.M. Mourning.\\" Given the style of the next song, \\"Memories of Love,\\" you could possibly include that with the previous four selections. All four are mellow and heavily orchestral as opposed to typical rock.<br /><br />The second suite begins with a fast rock beat. In the second movement a flute is prominent and though the bass and piano keep the beat moving, the instrumental has a strong jazz flavor. The third movement has a vocal part, with a strong blues flavor and a heavy beat. The fourth movement has a rock feel to it leading into the final song of the suite, \\"Where Do We Go from Here,\\" which was released as a B-side single.<br /><br />This album is amazing. The musical styles include jazz, blues, neo-classical, and rock. The combinations are broad enough and unusual enough to allow this music to be classified in a variety of genres. However, I choose to consider this album progressive rock because of the extended length of the suites and the unusual combination of styles. When considering the other groups considered progressive from this era, King Crimson, The Moody Blues, and Yes, it seems less of a stretch to consider this album progressive rock.<br /><br />Note that there is a later version of this CD available that contains the single versions of \\"Make Me Smile\\" and \\"25 or 6 to 4.\\" I always enjoy extra tracks, but you will need to judge whether there is a difference in price between that version and this one, and whether the difference is valuable to you.  That same version has also been remastered with the best recordings available. Enjoy!.  That same version has also been remastered with the best recordings available. Enjoy! <br />
0316168815|1.0|Absolute drivel. I read this because I was bored and this was supposed to be such a wonderful book. I'm sorry, but I just could not connect with the dead victim watching her family disentegrate over the years from her perch in heaven! It really jumped the shark for me when her spirit entered another girls body so that she could experience a sexual encounter with a boy she liked. I understand the author had some bad stuff to work out, but this fantasy was ridiculous!
B00005JNRY|5.0|I could not believe how down right fun this movie is.  The added benefit was seeing it in the El Capitan in Hollywood.  With the organ grinding away as you enter, then, getting to see a pit crew in action and then some kids getting up on stage, wow, then the movie.<br /><br />The review of the movie tells a lot of the plot, but the sond \\"Finding Yourself\\" really reveals the story.  When I see this movie, I think of the genius behind it.  Some say that hope is lost in America, well, this movie is one of hope, one of coming of age, one of learning to consider where you are headed in life.<br /><br />What got me the most was the spontaneous applause at the end of the movie, the whole audience just suddenly errupted with applause, I have not experienced such a joyful reaction from an audience in a long time.  Not that it is a cartoon, it sends a message, one of friendship and one of turning your life around from selfishness to learning to be a friend.<br /><br />The message to me is that it may only take one person to turn around the lives of many.  The animation is just outstanding, the sound track, wow, what great songs.  I think this may be one of Pixar's greatest movies.<br /><br />\\"Find yourself\\" seeing cars.
0131103628|5.0|For learning C programming, this book is the gold standard.  It is unpretentious and to the point, assuming that you have the general concept of what it means to program a computer and want to learn the C language.  It is gentle, but not touchy-feely, and guides you through what you need to know. <br /> <br />Personally, I think \\"The UNIX Programming Environment\\" by Kernighan and Pike is an excellent companion to this book (assuming you have a Unix-like environment with tools like make, yacc, and lexx).  That book conveys much of the philosophy of Unix and C that has made them such powerful and lasting foundations for everything we use in computers today.  Taken together, these two books give a solid (albeit fairly low-level) foundation. <br /> <br />Now, you may ask, why would I want to learn the C language and these low level tools today, when I really want to create great Web 2.0 sites using Ruby on Rails?  (Now that's a reference that's going to date quickly, I fear.)  The answer is: you probably don't.  For a great many programmers, there is probably no reason to master these basics that are so close to the core of the machine.  But if you are intent on mastering software development from high-level fast prototyping to low-level \\"to-the-metal\\" tweaking, this is where you need to go, and this book will convey the enjoyment and purity of working at that level with computers. <br /> <br />P.S.  Shout out to Anne Glaser - if you see this, it's the best answer I can give to your question - sorry I didn't see it earlier.
B000002GQE|5.0|Purchasing this classic requires no justification. Something of this scope and originality comes only once in a generation.  This is no hodgepodge collection of tunes.  There is an overriding theme carried throughout the release, the theme of a typical day in a life, and the highs and lows that are a part of it.  Each song, written about a particular time of the day, is joined by an orchestral bridge that plays off the original melodies.  The effect is that of an organic whole whose parts support the overall integrity of the work. <br /> <br />This is where you find such classics as \\"Nights in White Satin\\" and \\"Tuesday Afternoon.\\"  The most unusual and visionary piece is the underrated song, \\"Sunset,\\" whose orientalism is exotic and mystical.  Many people say that with age people grow in maturity.  But with the Moody Blues, I believe the opposite is true.  There is an urgency in this music, and a questioning in the lyrics.  That in itself speaks of a maturity unrivaled by either the Moody Blues' contemporaries or their own later works.  This release is the everyday drama of the everyman, which is why it succeeded in becoming such a timeless classic.  It is truly vintage rock.
B000FFJ85I|3.0|I'm not going to lie I became a fan when I purchased Sing the Sorrow before that AFI was just three letters I saw on alot of T-Shirts. I really dug their pseudo goth punk look and sound. Everything felt authentic and the musicianship was impressive. I have been meaning to check out some of their past records and I swear I'm getting to it.  <br /> <br />This brings us to Decemberunderground and I have to say that speaking even as a casual fan I was really dissapointed. Miss Murder is an A+ single that sadly is the best song on the entire record. Nothing matches the energy or meloncholy extremes found on Sing the Sorrow. Where are the infectious ballads? Where are the head banging tracks? Honestly the music is an evolution of their sound that I sort of expected. If your going to paint your face in the music biz you'll eventually dig into some electronic sounds and thats not the problem. The most glarring problem is the lyrics. What once felt authentic feels completely fake.  <br /> <br />Making analogies to stars, mentioning the word suicide just to sound cool, and talking about how awful life is...when your a millionaire rock star just feels completely fake and extremely forced. Use of the month of december to parallel the cold feeling of life is just too much. How is Davey's life so bleak when he's got the most popular band in todays modern music scene?  Some of this stuff is truly cringe inducing.  Sing the Sorrow was a fist pumping record this seems like a whiney weep fest for suburban kids who have rich parents and want to pretend that life sucks. <br /> <br />The phoniness of the record is what really bugs me. Nothing wrong with being dark and broody but for the love of gawd find some song topics that are beyond \\"I wanna kill myself\\" and \\"boy december is a cold month.\\" I'm sure Davey has some real life experiences he can sing about that are beyond this high school facade of hipster gloominess.  <br /> <br />I do dig the 80's pop synth sound they are going for and hopefully next time they'll back it up with authentic lyrics.

B00001O2GN|1.0|Amazon is confusing, they put the SAME reviews for two DIFFERENT DVD Boxsets. Make sure you DO NOT get the ROBOBOX and are looking at the Robocop MGM Trilogy. The great version of the Robocop collection is the MGM version with  Robocop 1 UNCUT. The Robocop 1 in the ROBOBOX collection is EDITED! I was mislead by all the positive reviews so I ended up getting the lame Robobox which simply just has the movies, no extras, and a butchered/edited masterpiece (yep, there are a couple minutes missing from Robocop). Avoid the blue Robobox, it's not the same DVD set everyone here is praising, it's DIFFERENT, not the definitive version of these classic movies. I wish somebody made that clear before I made a big mistake.
0743482832|4.0|This was Shakespeare's final piece of work. He created the character of Prospero in the image of himself. Being the main character, he was toppled in a coup set in his homeland of Milan, was a God-like magician capable of initiating storms and other kinds of magic. By coincidence he saw his enemies in a ship riding towards his island. Where he lived with his daughter Miranda and the native \\"savage\\" Caliban.He brought his enemies on his island. And in turn he made them do many interesting things on the island. yet in the end it was all nice and happy, unlike the tragic mood of \\"Hamlet\\" or \\"Romeo and Juliet\\".<br /><br />  The language was great as usual with all of Shakespeare's great works. Prospero's last lines said also became Shakespeare's last words in terms of writing was concerned. There were plenty of comedy scenes in the play involving the mean spirited native Caliban, who was a servant of Prospero and attempted to rape his daughter, Miranda and later tried to kill him. As the plot went, all became comedies as Prospero saw through everything, the good and the evil, the well planned and the silly.<br /><br />  As many of his contemporaries during the time. Shakespeare despised the natives and saw them as savages. This became clear with Caliban. I found Shakespeare's depictions of him relentless and cruel, almost as if he was describing a pig.<br /><br />  But, overall, the story was very interesting. If you like Shakespeare, then you are sure to like this.

0345440900|2.0|I ended up hurling this book across a room one day in complete frustration!  If you know ANYTHING about infant care, you will find so many inconsistencies within this book.  Tracy literally contradicts herself throughout.  For example, she tells you to watch your babies cues to know when he/she is tired but then she goes on to recommend an activity immediately following eating.  For most young babies, they are quite sleepy after they eat.  To throw in an activity at this point would be to ignore their sleepy cues and over stimulate them (leaving you with an overtired, crying baby).  I tried this \\"EASY\\" plan with my baby and think the only reason she throws in an activity after eating is because she wanted to be able to spell something cute with her \\"plan.\\"  What finally reduced me to tears (and the book ending up across the room) was her ORDERS that you get three one hour naps per day. What Mom actually has time for that?!  She makes you feel worse by going on to say that you will feel horrible at 12 weeks if you don't get these naps.  Ladies, let me tell you that it just isn't true.  The older your baby gets, the more you both adapt to one another.  My son is now 11 weeks old and I feel great--without the help of the self-proclaimed Baby Whisperer. I seriously doubt that I am going to all of a sudden feel horrible next week!  By the way, don't most Hollywood types that Tracy serves usually have baby nurses and nannies to take care of their children around the clock??? Maybe we should check with the nannies and nurses to see if these methods actually work--I doubt it!  P.S.--Babies will eventually fall into a routine on their own and don't need to be scheduled.
B000002UJQ|5.0|It's funny, my first encounter with \\"Radiohead\\" was back in '98 when I stumbled upon \\"OK Computer\\" in a used record store.  I was 14 years old and had no idea who \\"Radiohead\\" was or what kind of music they played.  I just saw the album on one of the shelves and was immediately drawn to it (for what reason, I can't say).  I don't know if it was the icy, abstract cover art or the name itself, but something about it grabbed my attention, commanding me to trade an armful of my adolescent movie soundtracks for that one strangely intriguing album. <br /> <br />When I got the disc home I immediately gave it a spin... and didn't know how to react.  The music wasn't at all inviting to my teenage ears... in fact, it seemed to hold me at arms length, a dense layer of instrumentation and impenetrable emotion that I was unable to relate to.  Up to this point, my musical taste was wholly dictated by what my parents listened to and what was currently in rotation on the local radio station.  I was so caught off guard that I couldn't even finish the first track, shutting off my CD player in a mix of confusion, dislike, and outright rejection.  The next day I returned \\"OK Computer\\" to the record store, most likely trading it in for a \\"Third Eye Blind\\" or \\"Wallflowers\\" album (I had much to learn about music). <br /> <br />Six years later, while a sophomore in college, I rediscovered \\"Radiohead\\" during a modern music class.  Once again I sought out \\"OK Computer,\\" purchasing it for the second (and final) time.  Needless to say I was blown away.  After hundreds of listens it never ceases to amaze me.  It contains some of the most haunting, emotional, and uplifting music I've ever had the pleasure of listening to.  Believe me, if you have the slightest bit of interest in \\"good\\" or \\"important\\" music, give this record a shot.  It may take you two, twenty, or a hundred listens before it \\"hits\\" you (it took me six years for God's sake), but when it finally does you'll realize why it's considered one of the seminal albums of the past twenty years.  Highly recommended.
1400079179|2.0|Dan Brown's novel was a decent read. It kept me entertained for the day it took me to read it. I actually only picked it up because controsversy intrests me. I would have given it three stars except for a few reasons.<br /><br />The parts I liked was the fast pacing and the lame character development didn't bother me, I love Crighton books.The premise was interesting enough. The writing is enjoyable enough, I don't read literary works of art for fun.<br /><br />Here is my opions of the bad points of the novel.<br /><br />First off despite what Sophie say's early on in the novel the book reads like American television. It would seem Dan Brown's favorite writing technique is the cliffhanger. Almost every chapter I could picture a commericial break.Also the ending sucked.<br /><br />Next before I go over the controversial subject manner I want to say one thing about the most common defense of the Da Vinci Code. Just because a novel is fiction does not mean the author doesn't have an agenda.Anyone who attended high school literature classes would have at some point learn that Dicken's wrote to critique Victorian society and his books were fiction. That The Scarlette Letter was Hawthorne's critique of the Puritans and was fiction. So I think Brown has an agenda.I personally think he was an axe to grind against the Catholic church specifically and perhaps the rest of Christianity in general.<br /><br />Now  for the controsversy, I suppose that it depends on how someone feels about their faith. I do understand why Catholic's would feel insulted. I also thought he could of tried to get historical facts right. If it is important enough to list a page of facts before the novel starts then he should get his other facts straight.Also his premise about the femine divine felt ludicrous at times. If women were so important to the priory why didn't more become the head leaders? Also I agree with the other reviewer who said that if Jesus was not divine then Mary Magdeline would not have been divinve just because she married and than carried Jesus's daughter. Also I would think Mary would have wanted to be reburied in Israel not France.Also as far as Christianity goes the Catholics are the only one's who had at least a near divine femine, Mary mother of Jesus. Also before the advent of Christianity treatment of women varied. Some were treated well in some cultures and treated just as badly in others.agdeline would not have been divinve just because she married and than carried Jesus's daughter.

Tom Scholz could have just let the original remasters from Sony be re-released, but since music is his passion & life, he got involved and personally remastered these albums himself.    The result is nothing short of awesome ! You can blast the music & there is absolutely no distortion. You can hear Brad's voice, Sib's drumming and Tom's guitar solo like you are sitting front row in a small club.     Inside the CD's are some never seen before Boston photos, hand picked by Tom and his team. The liner notes give you a short summary of what was involved recording these albums & an insight into the Boston recording process.    In a world of fast food music, this is a gourmet meal. If you are a longtime BOSTON fan, all your personal memories associated with this music come rushing back instantly.

There is something within it that really speaks to some people --- I say 'some,' because I have recommended it to many friends, and their responses have run the gamut from a fascination similar to my own, to outright boredom and frustration with the book. Personally, I felt I connected with Forster's lament regarding the loss of a sense of place and permanence in the modern world.    I must disagree with some of the reviewers here, when they say that the issues Forster tackles have little relevance today. I think what attracted me to this book was Forster's examination of those very issues --- most specifically, the quandry that still plagues us today: how can we live an examined, meaningful life in the entropic modern world? I would argue that Howards End is still very relevant.    Forster depicts a society in change, but also a society that is a direct relative of our own. He shows the conflicts of modern VS rural, city VS nature, business/sport VS intellect/art, and smug patriarchy VS proto-feminism. If you identified with the second choice in those four sets, then it is likely that you will very much appreciate the social commentary woven into Howards End, and you will find its sermon of \\"Only Connect!\\" something of a mission statement --- I certainly did.    Really, Howards End almost reads like an allegory. The different families (Schlegel, Wilcox, and Bast) each represent aspects of a society in transition, each one lacking some vital component to make it viable. The Schlegels are intellectual but ineffectual (declining \\"old money\\") and are generally feminine, while the aggressive Wilcoxes live in a shallow world of \\"telegrams and anger\\" (ascendent business class) and are generally masculine. The Basts are impoverished, kept from achieving their desires for both wealth and intellectual stimulation by their social and economic situation. Finally, there is Ruth Wilcox, who represents a lost patriarchal rural idyll, which Forster seems to both mourn and criticize at the same time.    A large portion of the charm and interest I found in Howards End came in watching these three 'sets' of characters bounce off each other, just as the larger groups theya re meant to represent interact within a society. Whether their intentions are good or bad, they usually end up doing each other harm. The results of these complex interactions are certainly interesting to read. By the end of the book, Forster has cleverly found a way \\"end\\" the conflict and graft what he sees as worthy about each family into one unit, offering an improbable, almost dream-like solution to the problems presented by the novel.     Finally, there is this: when it comes to the actual technical aspects of writing, Forster is a master. Whether or not you agree with his social agenda or his philosophies regarding the examined life, you will have no troubles reading Howards End. The prose is clean, clear, and flowing --- just like a mountain stream.
B000BZISQC|5.0|This is a wonderful movie for your psp. It is definitely Bruce Lee's best film. Contains great martial arts action, good story, and some humor. It is quite violent and intense at times and contains brief nudity and some drug use. Definitely not for kids. Bruce Lee's character must travel to a remote island for a fighting tournament, that is a cover for a drug operation run by a fanatical madman named Han whose henchmen killed Lee's sister a few years earlier. Lee teams up with several other competitor friends played by John Saxon, and Jim Kelly. Lee eventually uncovers the operation, gets to the only radio that's on the island and calls the military to come to the rescue. Lee, with help from others, eliminates Han and his entire group of fighters. The quality of the psp film is excellent. It is in widescreen. You cannot adjust the aspect ratio of the movie which means that if you don't like black bars on the top and bottom of the picture, then you're out of luck. Clean with very little grain and dirt.  It is the restored edition which runs 102 minutes, not the shorter version. The audio is stereo, not mono as listed on the psp box. Unfortunately there are no extras. But this is still a great film to watch if you're traveling on a train or long car ride. Also to be aware of. Do NOT watch this film with the little psp speakers. They do not reproduce the best sound. You will get the best sound with a good pair of headphones. Highly recommended.

B000EMGAOY|5.0|I have to say, I've always been a Chili Peppers' fan, but they've never been what I would call my \\"favorite\\" band.  I am very familiar with everything from Mother's Milk forward, and I've listended to a decent amount from the first 3 albums as well.  With that said, I believe Stadium Arcadium will be the album that will establish the Chili Peppers among the best bands EVER, and it has certainly made it difficult for me to say they are not now one of my favorite bands. <br /> <br />Like just about anyone else, I listen to the Jupiter CD more than the Mars CD.  Nevertheless, I have to say from beginning to end, there is not a filler on either.  These guys have taken everything they've done, re-made it, refined it, and added something new in a not-so-new way.  You can use words like funk, punk, rap, rock, etc, but the Red Hot Chili Peppers are now clearly beyond categorization.   <br /> <br />I believe with Stadium Arcadium, the Red Hot Chili Peppers can now be viewed as falling within two distinct eras, with a break in the middle -- First, from the self-titled debut through Blood Sugar Sex Magik, that paritcular band was ground breaking and amazing.  Then, I think everyone will acknowledge that with One Hot Minute they simply provided a mediocre album with 2, maybe 3 above average songs.  But now, with Californication, By the Way, and Stadium Arcadium they really have become one of the best bands of all-time.  There is no other band like these guys, and it seems that with over 20 strong years they have most certainly stood the test of time. <br /> <br />So with all my rambling to this point, let me just put it out there -- As much as I have enjoyed what these guys have done before now, I believe Stadium Arcadium is by far and away their best album yet.  Whereas most great bands eventually live off their name and throw out a decent new album (or not) every 5 years or so, the Red Hot Chili Peppers have done what every band can only dream of by saving their best for last... at least for now. <br /> <br />
B00005JMCW|3.0|Freaky friday is a movie which you can watch it on a weekend with your family and friends.it has loads of fun...and the performance by the lead actors is convincingly good.and the best part is the movie has a message,which is very nice.its a sweet nice film.over all its a light-hearted comedy movie you can watch on a fun evening.we had a goodtime watching this movie.
B00003CX8U|5.0|This is indeed a genious work disguised as a musical, but it is a very touching moving where lady death lets Gideon (the main character) live his own intemporalilty while reviewing his past life... its showtime folks!
B000EJ9MTW|4.0|I listened to the song Mother on Jimmy Kimmel and I thought I was hearing Uriah Heap all over again.
B000001DTM|5.0|I am not one of those that can say that I know the trajectory of U2. Im more of a prog rock fan in this field. However, I can spot good rock-pop music, and this album has it.. do not know the context of the bands evolution, but this is art.
B000B8QG0O|5.0|Yes it's true and people didn't think it could be done, Buzz & Woody back for a second adventure. In this film Woody finds out the real reason why he was made, he was a character on a TV show and Woody is one of the last remaining dolls made for that TV show.  <br />Woody is stolen by a rare toy collector when he accidentally ends up in a yard sale. So this time it is Buzz's mission to save Woody from being sold to a Japanese toy museum.  <br />Along the way on this mission we encounter a few new toys who are also a part of the Woody toy collection. Jessie The Yodelin' Cowgirl & Prospect Pete.  <br />I can't say anymore than that because the rest is a secret just get this movie and ejoy it because it is just as good as the first if not better.
B00000ICN5|5.0|Okay, Texas Flood and Pride and Joy are, plain and simple, two of the greatest blues songs ever. His solo on Texas Flood shows just what a guy with enough talent could do with the simple Blues format, as does Pride and Joy. Two amazing songs...<br /><br />...of course, the rest is mostly also great: Testify, Love Struck Baby, Rude Mood (one of the fastest songs ever, for the record) and  Lenny are my favorites other than the first two songs, but there isn't a bad step on this album. Hell of a way to start your career! If this and Couldn't Stand the Weather aren't in your record collection, you must be insane! Seriously!<br /><br />Oh, the bonus tracks are amazing, including an early version of Roughest Place in Town that positively OWNS, plus a few nice live songs (he plays Testify, Mary Had a Little Lamb and Wham!, the last of which shoulda been on the original album). Generally I don't like bonus tracks, but this is the exception.<br /><br />Run off and buy this one. For some insane reason, I've been seeing alot of SRV in the bargain bins lately, but at least you'll find it cheap. Still, I'd probably pay more than full price for this one!
B000EHSVQ4|5.0|This is the 3 hour+ version that adds 45 minutes onto the original film. I'm very glad I caught this at the theater -- Fox released it on only one screen -- but it's finally out on DVD. <br /> <br />Here's what I thought of it: Wow. Honestly -- wow. <br /> <br />The movie is completely redeemed and now succeeds in ways that it didn't before. <br /> <br />Every one of my criticisms of the previous version has been addressed. <br /> <br />It no longer feels like, as the New Yorker put it, a \\"hollow show about a boy.\\" I had pointed out that, as a \\"hero\\" movie, Orlando Bloom's character is forced to shoulder the film, something he can't really do. I said that \\"the more you de-emphasize his centerpiece in the movie, the better off everyone is\\" and that's exactly what happens here. Much of those 45 minutes adds bulk to the movie, placing Balian in greater context with the situation at hand and his own fractured frame of mind. Somehow -- and I know this is rather hard to believe -- but they've redeemed Orlando in this. Some of his best lines have been added to and given additional weight because now we know what lies behind them. He's a vastly more intriguing and stronger character even as he feels as one player in all this and not the only player. Yes, he's the protagonist but the film no longer feels like it's about only him. <br /> <br />Even that much-hated shot on my part, the Teen Beat 270 spin, makes sense now; the visual approach there is motivated from ideas planted earlier. They show that wall surrounding him for a reason... <br /> <br />Additional scenes are added that give greater depth to all the major characters. From Sir Godfrey to Saladin to King Baldwin, everyone becomes more interesting. <br /> <br />Sibylla, Eva Green's character, wasn't much more than a strumpet in the first version and I didn't care for it at all. Here, she's completely reworked and, with a fairly large subplot added, is now a tragic figure of Shakespearean proportion as she plays outa heartbreaking game of thrones. It's a terrific female lead and a fascinating character. She's so much *more* than before. <br /> <br />There's a subplot involving Liam Neeson's character at the beginning, a power struggle of sorts between he and his brother. Remember the attack in the forest? Men at arms showed up to bring Balian to justice, right? Wrong -- now it's simply a masquerade for an assassination attempt on Godfrey conducted by his nephew. The whole sequence is bulked up and enriched. <br /> <br />One of my criticisms was this: \\"Another problem with the movie is the lack of time scale. It seems that everything in the movie takes place over the course of six days, from Bilian becoming a knight to the final outcome of the siege of Jerusalem.\\" Now, the time scale comes across in years, not weeks. The subplot of Balian managing his barony is given room to breathe. <br /> <br />Minor characters blossom into something quite memorable even as more moments of \\"art\\" are added. The film is much more evocative and has visual metaphors that it didn't before. Many more \\"Ridley Scott\\" moments of pure visual magic. Those moments are simply stunning. <br /> <br />To be sure, the heart and soul of the film was ripped out in the first version. This director's cut is a terrific redo of the movie and turns KoH into one of Ridley's most complex, epic films. I absolutely recommend this version. <br /> <br />The Director's Cut of KoH is one of the best movies of 2005 and shoots into the top 3 on my list. <br />
B000002LRX|3.0|I remeber listening to this album when I was approx 17 and absolutely loving it. I have been listening to it again recently. There are a few good tracks but its nowhere near as good as \\"The Real Thing\\" or \\"King For A Day\\" which cracks me up in a lot of parts due to its ridiculous and meaningless extremeness. <br />\\"Land of sunshine\\" and \\"Midlife Crisis\\" are ok. \\"Caffeine\\" and \\"Smaller and Smaller\\" are good although the latter drags on a bit. \\"RV\\" is ok for a while, but you know the drill pretty quickly after a while. The highlights would be \\"Everything's ruined\\" \\"A Small victory\\" and \\"easy\\". \\"Be Aggressive\\" and \\"Malpractice\\" are plain stupid and annoying. \\"Kindergarten\\" bores me. Still though, Angel Dust is a good album, just not my favorite anymore. It is a deranged effort with some mysterious yet troubling moments.  Contrary to most people, I have more trouble with Patton's voice in Angel's Dust than in The Real Thing.
B000F3AAUW|3.0|On the one hand, Gorillaz member Danger Mouse and Goodie Mob member Cee-Lo create a short, simple musical journey that's enjoyable like eating a Twinkie is enjoyable. 14 tracks, all clocking in at approximately 2 1/2 to 3 1/2 minutes each makes this cd go quickly, but only a few songs tide you over after repeated listens.<br /><br />On the other hand, I've heard this music before. In fact, Terence Trent D'Arby accomplished much of the same with his 1993 effort \\"Symphony Or Damn\\" and his 1995 effort \\"Vibrator\\". Gnarls Barkley isn't a direct copy, but this duo undermines themselves by being too derivative. They're original, but yet not original at all. They just seem to borrow from everything that's come before, dressed it up to look pretty and sent it back out into the world to be admired and re-discovered.<br /><br />I'll give this cd three stars until I hear their next album (if there is a next album). In my not so humble opinion, \\"Go Go Gadget Gospel\\", \\"Crazy\\", \\"Smiley Faces\\" and \\"Just A Thought\\" are the strongest songs on the disc. They avoid being irritating, and they have strong enough lyrics/melodies to be memorable. They do justice to Violent Femmes classic \\"Gone Daddy Gone\\", another strong track. Do the math and you have five solid tracks out of 14. The rest of the cd seems listless, irritating and unmemorable after a dozen listens.<br /><br />I'd say \\"St. Elsewhere\\" has to be the most overrated cd of 2006. Yes it's popular, but popular with whom? I suspect ignorance is the cause of Gnarls Barkley's success. The average music listener isn't familiar with the past, so \\"St. Elsewhere\\" seems pretty spectacular unless, like me, you've been collecting music for over 20 years. Three stars means good, and that's as far as I'll go with \\"St. Elsewhere\\". I'll further prove my point by betting that few realized that \\"Gone Daddy Gone\\" belongs to the Violent Femmes circa 1983.
B000FILW86|5.0|For me, 'Rockford' is an Earth-shattering recording. First, I am from Rockford, long ago. Second, I've been a Cheap Trick fan from their 1970s bar-band days on North Main Street. And I still believe their first three albums (not CDs kiddies, real vinyl albums) were among the best rock recordings of all time.  <br /> <br />But then came the 1980s. I moved to North Carolina and Cheap Trick became, ah, sorta boring. I kept hoping, but recording after recording disappointed me. Yeah, there were tracks here and there, and the  distinctive sound popped up in movies or on the radio, instantly recognizable. But Cheap Trick was washed up for me. <br /> <br />I saw them in concert a couple years ago in Rockford, and it was a blast, but the band looked a bit tired and old. You know, like all these geezer rockers out there. <br /> <br />And now, along comes ROCKFORD. Yikes! Truly, within a minute of the first track, 'Welcome to the World,' I knew my band was back. And then the fantastic 'Perfect Stranger', followed by  ... well the first 6 tracks on this CD are the best six consecutive tracks IN ROCK HISTORY. That is how good this is. All 12 tracks are excellent. <br /> <br />Robin's Zander's voice is in full 20-year-old power. Rick Nielsen's guitar is slamming, screaming in response to Zander's voice. The bass and drums are pounding out a relentless beat. This is fun. <br /> <br />Listen to this, and you break into a giant grin. It is relentless, pitch-perfect, taunting, teasing power pop. And I mean POWER! The energy level is amazing. <br /> <br />I can only bow before my former idols. They are my idols again.
0393317552|1.0|I've yet to read a more thoroughly biased and intellectually repugnant book. Diamond bathes in anything that can support his ridiculous hypotheses, ignoring the overwhelming evidence that does not. For instance, he expects his ignorant readers to assume that sub-Saharan Africa had no domesticatable animals and plants, something that almost made me fall out of my chair with laughter. Sub-Saharan Africans live in richest area of the planet, from minerals to fauna! The entire region is teaming with multitudes of plants and animals that would be easily domesticated: sorghum, millet, yams,  and rice; guinea fowl, elephants, buffalo, giraffes, zebras, and wildebeests. <br /> <br />On the plus side, though, I must admit the book makes a great coaster.
B000002H6C|5.0|I've been listening to this CD for almost 2 decades and it is still one of the best recordings I own.  Aside from what so many others have said about the beauty of the playing and arrangements, I would like to add that the overt socio-political message of the album is as relevant as ever.  The cover alone says it all.  If you haven't heard this record, it's time to dive in.
B000F3AAUW|4.0|Wasn't sure about what to write in subject line and don't want to be torn to shreds by other reviewers, however, I really like this album.  My taste runs the gamut from Art of Noise to ZZ Top and I grew up listening to Chicago house music.  This brings me back to those days of soul and R&B music that wasn't overtly offensive and sleazy, but actual rhythm & blues.  They've got great vocals on every song and they've done some great musical stylings.  I think it's creative.  For me, it's an aural marriage of Outkast and Luther Vandross, with a little bit of freaky odd thrown in for good measure.  It's entertaining, open your mind and listen to the words!
B000FBGBPC|5.0|I was driving to an electronic store to get my camera fixed.  On the way, I hear a comercial on the radio for this CD.  I hear that one of its tracks is \\"Animal I have Become\\", which I have heard before and loved.  While I was at the store, I decided to check the CD out.  Most of the time, I buy CDs for just one of its songs, so I decided to buy it while I was there.   Although I mainly only bought it for \\"Animal I have become\\", I decided to check all the other songs first.  As soon as I heard the, I loved them.  I only got the CD 2 days ago and I have heard every track almost 10 times. <br />1.  It's All Over 5/5- A great opening song.  Really powerful and moving. <br />2.   Pain 4.5/5- good song, it does take a few moments before the song really kicks in. <br />3.  Animal I Have Become- Awesome track.  Very catchy tune and lyrics.  Buy the CD for this song. <br />4.  Never too Late 5/5.  Another great powerful moving song.  It is something I myself can relate to and others guys I know. <br />5.  On My Own 4/5- Althoug its is one of the my lesser favorites, I still enjoy listing to it. <br />6.  Riot 4.5/5- Very catchy and loud.  This sing really kicks in quickly. <br />7.  Get out alive 4.5/5- a little slow but still a really awesome song. <br />8.  Let it Die 5/5- Another very powerful moving song.  This song helps me connects with real issues I have experienced. <br />9.  Over and Over 5/5- Another great memorable song.  One of my favorites. <br />10.  Time of Dying 5/5- I feel like crying when I hear this song.  It really does help me remember a time in my lie when I needed help.  Very powerful. <br />11.  Gone Forever 4/5- A little slow but still good. <br />12.  One-X 3.5- My least favorite but still enjoyable. <br />This is seriousely one awesome.  If you love rock, you'll this Cd.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I love this movie, its the best Romance movie of all times, better than any romance movie I have seen by far. Both character played by Kaira & Matthew did an excellent job, chemistry seems realisting!!!Definitely a must, I seen this movie so many times, and it gets better.
B000FFJ85I|1.0|If you like bubble-gum pop-punk warped-tour modern rock, and are a 14 year old girl, then go ahead and buy this CD. If you have been a fan of AFI's goth-like, misfit's influenced progressive punk for the last several years as I have been, you will find yourself, as I did, skipping through tracks to see if any good songs are included on this album before you hear the whole thing and then become ultimately disapointed.  <br /> <br />After hearing the first song, I really thought this was some kind of joke. By the end of the record, I was disgusted to realize the good ol' Art of Drowning days are long gone; never to return. I guess AFI have turned into another gimme-money warped tour-teenie bopper band, which is very sad considering all the great music they have made in their career.  <br />I really thought after Sing the Sorrow, they were heading in a good direction, dispite the high-end production aimed at selling more recirds. This just sickens me though.  <br /> <br />If this album was put out by Green Day, Saves the Day, or Sum 41, or some band like that, I would have to go \\"OK, that's pretty good\\", but AFI???? I really expect more from them!  <br /> <br />I guess I'm just going to add this to my list of records from great bands that went bad, like Danzig 5, Metallica's Load, the Misfits' Project 1950 & so on!   <br /> <br />Too bad you can't return a CD to the store for sucking!
B000F3UAFC|5.0|When it comes to playwrights who can manipulate the English language with a flair, endless double entendres, and clever dialogue, few can match Oscar Wilde.  In this wholly entertaining and luxurious adaptation of his fine play 'Lady Windemere's Fan' screen writer Howard Himelstein and director Mike Barker have created a bright confection of film that is bubbling with sex, scandal, seduction, secrets, and all manner of romantic subterfuge. It is a winner all around.<br /><br />Mrs. Erlynne (Helen Hunt) is a lady of desires who has just fled the USA with debtors breathing down her voluptuous d&eacute;colletage: she has always made her way by courting and conquering married men and their bank accounts.  She flees to Amalfi where she encounters the Windemeres - dashing Robert (Mark Umbers) and his gorgeous but somewhat naive wife of one year Meg (Scarlett Johansson).  Mrs. Erlynne and Robert share a secret that is mistaken by all to be an affair: Meg the pure is simultaneously being seduced by Lord Darlington (Stephen Campbell Moore).  The townsfolk of Amalfi gossip and spy and plan at every occasion to bring light to the goings on of the naughty Mrs. Erlynne - with the exception of a twice divorced older gent Tuppy (Tom Wilkinson) who instead has his eye on Mrs. Erlynne as his perfect new mate.  The trail of cookie crumbs is left when Mrs. Erlynne advises Robert to buy his wife a fan - with all the history of seductive uses that holds.  That fan travels around the circles and is eventually the means by which the secrets are made clear and the misrepresented scandals are solved.<br /><br />The setting of Wilde's comedy has been updated very successfully to the 1930s and the costumes and extraordinary views of the insides and vistas of Amalfi are a fine marriage.  The actors are to the person excellent with Helen Hunt giving a fine portrayal of a character at first difficult to like (but she is a good woman!).  Scarlett Johansson once again proves that her dramatic skills are equal to her beauty and Tom Wilkinson, Milena Vukotic, and the entire cast toss Wilde's wonderful lines into the air like butterflies.  This is a very special film, one that touches the brain, the heart and the sense of humor in a most delectable manner. One wonders why on earth the critics panned it during the theatrical release.  I'm sure Wilde would have a fitting answer for that! Highly recommended.

B00004Y6NW|4.0|Dire Straits was in my opinion an overrated band.I only liked their debut album as it contained two great songs in Sultans of swing and Down to the waterline.I have found their remaining albums dull and dreary.I would recommend you to get this along with albums from the Rolling Stones,The Who and Led Zeppelin and avoid all their other albums.
B000F5GNX8|3.0|Shane Black is a hard driving propulsive director who seems to value speed highly.  In some films it works: In KISS KISS BANG BANG the result is just a silly, self-absorbed 'in joke' that quickly wears out its welcome.<br /><br />Harry Lockhart (Robert Downey, looking a bit long in the tooth) escapes his career in minor petty crime in New York and flees to Los Angeles where he serendipitously lands in an acting studio tryout and is picked up as a method actor for a part in a crime movie.  He is assigned to Gay Perry (Val Kilmer) who is to train him in matters detective, but instead ends up in a crime investigation that involves a lot of unfocused characters and corpses and Lockhart's old high school sweetheart Harmony Faith Lane (Michelle Monaghan).  The plot is convoluted to say the least and it is made more annoying by the technique of voice over by Downey's character that flash forwards, static pauses, and flash backs in an amateurish way that begins as funny and rapidly becomes irritating.  The film seems to be a parody of the genre and as so often can happen in parody, unless it is sensitively written, it becomes too infatuated with itself to make us care about anyone or any event.<br /><br />Downey, Kilmer, and Monaghan give it their best and it is good to see Downey back on the screen: he is a gifted actor after all.  The saving grace of the film is thanks to cinematographer Michael Barrett who shows us a Los Angeles of spectacular beauty. But in the end Shane Blake shows us that trying to be ever so clever can result is a sort of a mess.  And if you can make it through this film and watch the Gag Role featurette, you'll see the reason the film got so off track: 'in jokes' that are so 'in' fail to be entertaining.  Grady Harp, June 06
0345363132|5.0|This was a wonderful story.  Although I was prepared to keep an open mind as to my previous opinions on Richard III (from reading Alison Weir's Princes in the Tower), I was sure I would still come out believing that Richard did the kids.  Now I am not so convinced, I am prepared to believe he was a good man.  This book also covers much about Edward the IV, Richard's brother.  All in all a very good history lesson.<br /><br />The book was well written, the story line kept me interested through all 900 + pages and I will definitely read more from this author.  I have already read the Welsh trilogy (highly recommended).
0449002632|5.0|I love it when I read a book and realize how much I have learned while having a good time reading.  This is a book that will give you an overview of the history of London over the period of two thousand years!  By following the generations of several families that made London their home, Rutherfurd tells many entertaining stories, teaches us about many great events in history, how many different cultures came to this great city and became part of it.  For lovers of England and lovers of history, Rutherfurd's three novels, \\"Sarum\\", \\"London\\" and \\"The Forest\\" give a sampler of English history in three distinct regions.  They are all great reading and a very fun way to learn.  If you liked reading about London in this book, you might also enjoy the excellent book \\"In Search of London\\" by H.V. Morton, a very evocative guide to the city and people of London by a great English author.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|What a terrific show, music!  A couple of dud songs, but most are stellar!
B00004Y6NX|5.0|Your opinion about this great album is not needed. Dire Straits <br />are in my opinion are one of my favorite bands of all time. The bands you hate such as DIRE STRAITS, NIRVANA, GUNS N' ROSES, AND <br />FOREIGNER ARE ACTULLY GREAT and the bands you really love such as THE ROLLING STONES are horrible and suck. So grow up and stop <br />hating my favorite songs such as the lovely Expresso Love. <br /> <br />Anyway, I can't say much because of these 1 star jerks below me. <br />Expresso Love is lovely, nice, and beautiful....so as Tunnel of Love. They are my favorite songs on this album. And please ignore <br />that jerk below me and his recommendations. <br />Thanks.. and don't give anymore 1 star reviewers.
B000F6IOC0|5.0|;)<br /><br />But really, I have to preface my review with the fact that, although being female and very much prefer the male gender, there is nothing wrong with acknowledging the attractiveness of another woman.  I am completely convinced that Kate Beckensale is the hottest chick on the planet.<br /><br />Now, that said, I definitely prefered this installment of the Underworld saga for script-writing reasons.  I felt the storyline was more rich and the character interaction drew me in more.  Although I feel that many movies have resorted solely to CG to capture a movie-goer's attention (instead of plot), I felt compelled to watch to see the story unfold.  It didn't hurt that I felt the movie was gorgeous to boot.
B00004Y6NV|5.0|Urgggghhhh! These 1 star reviewers really give me on my nerves. <br />Can Amazon.com delete them???? <br />Anyway, Heavy Fuel is great and it rocks!!!!!!!! <br />The other songs are good too. <br />But Heavy Fuel is one of the greatest and it rocks!!!!!! <br />and it's one of my all time favorites. <br />please ignore the 1 star reviewers below me. thanks.
B0002DB0FO|5.0|I recently ordered the first season of Everwood and am looking forward to watching the shows again.  It was a huge mistake to cancel this show because it was the only thing on the WB worth watching.  I hope the rest of the seasons will be out on dvd soon and I will purchase all of them to enjoy them over and over.
B000000W5P|3.0|I'm not a Rolling Stones fan. I dislike all their other poser overrated albums. This one has 1 good song in Shattered.....do <br />me a favor please and avoid all the other Stones albums, this one <br />is good......  <br />thanks.
B00005JOSS|5.0|Sure - there are flaws in this movie - but who cares when you are riveted to your seat with that sense of romantic wonderment few movies manage to impart. If all this film had were the scenes between Keanu R. and Chris Plummer as estranged father and son - the whole 2 hours would have been worth it. But there is more - the incredible Paul McCartney track that melts you in a line of lyric or the tender way the theme of pining and loneliness are handled - or even the short dialogue about lighting and architecture that makes you think twice.<br /><br />This is a film about waiting and longing that also explores the forgotten art of letter writing as two people get to know each other slowly and out of time in a timeless place of their shared thoughts. This film is thoughtful and unstylishly....sweet. Because it is sweet - it isn't surprising it's vulnerable to critics, skeptics and plot mechanics.
B00004Y6NU|5.0|How could anyone hate this great album? This album is terrific. <br />The ones you like such as DEBUT AND BROTHERS IN ARMS SUCK!!!!! <br />Making Movies is great. BUT THEN YOU NEED TO STOP LOVING ZEPPELIN THE WORST BAND IN HISTORY...... This album is needed <br />with great songs like Industrial Disease, and It Never Rains <br />listen.

B00004R7TP|5.0|Kate's fans are already all over this I'm sure, so I'm writing for the initiate. If you only buy one Kate Bush CD, this is the one. It is not just her masterpiece, it is a masterpiece by any measure. One of my all-time favorite CDs.
B000ENWKN8|4.0|Rob Zombie is honestly an artist that I would've normally ever bought.  I found the CD EDUCATED HORSES for a steal at a pawn shop and knowing that it was Zombie's most recent CD that had a handsome enough debut (#5 on the Billboard 200 Albums Chart), I thought I would pick it up and listen.  Boy I am glad that I did!  The album isn't say particularly innovative in anyway, but it is a solid album.  This album has several attributes that make it one of 2006's better albums among a mixed bag of releases that have graced the music industry this year.<br /><br />One of the largest attributes is the heaviness of the guitar. While at times they may be the slightest bit overproduced, the overall timbre is nothing but desirable. The guitars sound sick here and very representative of metal. Another attribute is Zombie's vocals.  Zombie has a nice voice with a very interesting timbre to it that makes even less inspired material rock hard.  The instrumentation of EDUCATED HORSES is another plus;  besides whining guitars are gritty vocals, there is piano throughout a number of the tracks, making even the hardest rocking metal track have a plaintive side to it.<br /><br />Overall, there are no terrible tracks on this album in the least- for the most part they are at least average, if not better than average. Tracks that stood out in my mind included \\"American Witch\\", \\"Foxy, Foxy\\", \\"17 Year Locust\\", \\"The Scorpion Sleeps\\", \\"Death Of It All\\", and \\"The Devil's Rejects\\".  Perhaps the biggest blessing or detraction however you view it is the 38 minute length.  For the price of a new copy, 38 minutes may seem robbery, but where the \\"tightness\\" of the album is concerned, 38 minutes is a blessing because there truly is no filler material, just a few tracks that don't stack up against the hits which is certainly a better formula than \\"filler\\" tracks.<br /><br />Overall, It is ashamed that despite a nice debut on the Billboard 200 that this album isn't selling better than it is.  It is worth a listen.  Certainly it isn't say 2006's album of the year because there are better albums, but it is certainly one of the year's better albums if nothing else. 4 stars.t is worth a listen.  Certainly it isn't say 2006's album of the year because there are better albums, but it is certainly one of the year's better albums if nothing else. 4 stars.
0380977788|5.0|I'll keep it brief so as to not give anything away: <br /> <br />This book is short and sweet and fairly creepy. I am nearing 20 years of age, and I had shivers running down my spine on more than one occassion. It has some tidbits of humor and a very interesting cat as one of the characters. I suppose this book is meant for young adults, but I would recommend it for all ages.
B00006879E|1.0|I don't know why anyone could like this crap. It's terrible! Adam Levine's voice sounds like he chugged a whole pitcher of canola oil, and yet, the songs are too slow, and boring. This love Has Taken It's Toll On ME? More like \\"This BAND has taken it's toll on me!\\"<br /><br />You want good music? listen to Coheed And Cambria and System Of A Down.
B000ETQRCM|5.0|I own every Pearl Jam album, and like them all.  This is the best album since \\"Yield,\\" and ranks among their best.  I know some are comparing it to \\"Ten\\" and \\"Vs.\\" but what is different is the production--\\"Pearl Jam\\" seems as though it was done by a garage band--and the raw sound adds something to this album.  I definately recommend this for PJ fans and for anyone interested who loves real, uncommercial, rock music.

B00006CXSS|5.0|This is truly one of the best WW2 movies of all time.  Through ten segments, each a little over an hour in length, you follow both individuals and Easy Company, 101st Airborne as a whole through rigorous training, the horrors of D-Day and other battles throughout France and Germany, all the way to Hitler's officers last stand, the Eagles Nest. Produced by Stephen Speilburg and Tom Hanks and based on Stephen Ambrose's best-selling book, this series shows the many aspects of war for Easy including the stress of battle and the thrill of victory. <br />This was certainly woth every cent. Simply amazing! <br />
B00003CXC6|5.0|Leave it to the Criterion Collection to give Akira Kurosawa's seminal 1950 masterpiece its due with this superb 2002 DVD package. First, renowned Japanese film scholar Donald Richie provides a terrifically insightful commentary as he does on classics of other Japanese genres, Yasujiro Ozu's family drama, \\"Early Summer\\" (1951), and Kô Ichiwara's sun-tribe melodrama, \\"Crazed Fruit\\" (1956). Second, there is a seventeen-minute excerpt about the film from a feature-length documentary about its masterful cinematographer, \\"World of Kazuo Miyagawa\\", who did similarly amazing work on Kenji Mizoguchi's \\"Ugetsu\\" (1953) and Ozu's \\"Floating Weeds\\" (1959). Third, if you choose to buy rather than rent the DVD, there is a beautifully designed booklet with relevant excerpts from Kurosawa's autobiography and the two short stories by Ryunosuke Akutagawa from which Kurosawa and co-writer Shinobu Hashimoto based their screenplay. Add a brief testimonial introduction by Robert Altman, and this becomes one of the best of the Criterion Collection DVDs.<br /><br />Set in feudal 12th-century Japan, it is a far more intimate film than its vaunted reputation leads one to believe and quite brief at 88 minutes. Ostensibly a courtroom drama, the multi-layered story focuses on the rape of a woman and the murder of her husband in a forest grove. The events of the crimes are told from four different perspectives - a swaggering bandit named Tajômaru, a woodcutter who witnesses the crime, the wife and even the murdered husband by way of a medium. Each account unfolds in a distinct style - an extravagant samurai adventure according to Tajômaru, the wife's melodramatic recollection as a victim, a heroic martyr's tale from the dead husband. In a blessedly economical style, the contradictions in their accounts multiply as the story unfolds.<br /><br />The framing device is the woodcutter's own flashback of the incident as told to a commoner, but his version is far from the definitive one as he may have stolen a dagger from the crime scene. Kurosawa does such a brilliantly dexterous job in structuring the differing accounts that as the film progresses, it becomes less about seeking the truth and more about the power and inevitable conflicts arising from everyone's sense of ego. The only thing that becomes clear by the end is how individual perceptions shape reality and that the absolute truth is a myth. Miyagawa's expert camerawork is stellar in a way that raises the bar for subsequent cinema, especially the vivid facial close-ups of the main characters, the sharp angles of the sun-dappled forest scenes, and the dramatically ink-tinted raindrops.<br /><br />A sterling cast has been assembled with Kurosawa's muse, Toshiro Mifune, a youthfully feral presence as Tajômaru. Masayuki Mori and an especially vibrant Machiko Kyô, who later reunited in the ghostly \\"Ugetsu\\", lend particular distinction to the couple ensnared by the tragic situation, and the three legendary actors show impressive versatility in highlighting different aspects of their personalities in the various accounts. Takashi Shimura, who later starred in Kurosawa's poignant \\"Ikuru\\", is also superb as the woodcutter. Many filmmakers have since copied Kurosawa's then-daring narrative structure (for example, Martin Ritt's \\"The Outrage\\" and Edward Zwick's \\"Courage Under Fire\\"), but none comes close to capturing the pervasive sense of ambiguity that makes this movie retain its initial power.have stolen a dagger from the crime scene.

0385336691|3.0|I love Jack Reacher and have gotten many of my friends hooked on him.  Though I enjoyed this book, it is the weakest of the series.  There is almost no action until the end of the book and then it is not much by \\"Reacher\\" standards. <br /> <br />If you are considering this book as your first Jack Reacher/Lee Child book, stop now.  Order any of the earlier books and come back to this one.  Otherwise you may find this book boring and will miss out on a great series of books.  But do come back to it. <br /> <br />I am certainly not ready to give up on Jack Reacher/Lee Child as I have done with other writers who have lost their way like Patrica Cornwell with Kay Scarpetta.
B000EULJLU|5.0|This is my new favorite CD. I can't believe all the people below saying they expected more. It gets a B+. <br />And for only $8.88? Are you kidding me? For that price they don't have to worry about pirating.
B000FQJAIW|1.0|I was just in the process of purchasing this when I was arrested by the appearance of 2 stars.<br /><br />Why 2 stars?  We're finally getting what we wanted by having both versions of the film released right?<br /><br />WRONG!!  Non-anamorphic transfer + Dolby Digital 2.0 = Maximum Profit / Minimal Input.<br /><br />Ha ha...nice try.  I will not purchase this nor be suckered by the \\"Limited Release\\" tag line.<br /><br />Maybe they'll beef the original version when HD comes out.  Sure, they'll claim over and over again that they have \\"no plans\\", but didn't we all buy that line when Lucas stated he had no intention of releasing the original trilogy?<br /><br />Yeah, ok, whatever.  I'll stick with the shoddy special edition on DVD - you know, the one where Vader's saber is pink in \\"Return of the Jedi\\" and where Luke's saber is green on the Millenium Falcon in \\"A New Hope.\\"  I need to have corrective vision if THAT version is considered restored - so much for the \\"THX\\" logo, huh?
B0007OY2P8|5.0|Several other reviewers complained that this movie is \\"hokey\\" or too surreal. I really liked it. Jane Austen's Northanger Abbey is a satire of gothic novels. I thought the odd dream sequences and the music that sounded like it belonged in a bad horror movie were successful in showing Catherine for what she is: a rather silly girl with an over active imagination. I think anyone who has read the novel will see that and be amused by it. Anyone who has not read the novel will probably be very confused.
B000FJA1BO|5.0|This is a poignant, compelling narrative of an intelligent, intense, and idealistic young man, Chris McCandless, who cut off all ties to his upper, middle class family, and reinvented himself as Alexander Supertramp, a drifter living out of a backpack, eking out a marginal existence as he wandered throughout the United States. A modern day King of the Road, McCandless ended his journey in 1992 in Alaska, when he walked alone into the wilderness north of Denali. He never returned.<br /><br />Krakauer investigates this young man's short life in an attempt to explain why someone who has everything going for him would have chosen this lifestyle, only to end up dead in one of the most remote, rugged areas of the Alaskan wilderness. Whether one views McCandless as a fool or as a modern day Thoreau is a question ripe for discussion. It is clear, however, from Krakauer's writing that his investigation led him to feel a strong, spiritual kinship with McCandless. It is this kindred spirit approach to his understanding of this young man that makes Krakauer's writing so absorbing and moving.<br /><br />Krakauer retraces McCandless' journey, interviewing many of those with whom he came into contact. What develops is a haunting, riveting account of McCandless' travels and travails, and the impact he had on those with whom he came into contact. Krakauer followed McCandless' last steps into the Alaskan wilderness, so that he could see for himself how McCandless had lived, and how he had died. This book is his epitaph.
B00005JOVH|4.0|The third and perhaps last installment of the X-Men franchise is as exciting and thrilling as the previous 2, though it does lack some of the class and almost all of the subtlety of its predecesors.  The theme of tolerance has always been part of the X-Men universe, but in this edition the idea gets beaten into the viewers head over and over again like one long public service announcement.  After a while one tires of the message and longs for senseless violence to drown out the constant preaching.  Fortunately, the senseless violence arrives in the form of a climatic battle at a pharmaceutical company located on Alcatraz Island.  The antagonist mutants are able to get to the island only after Magneto picks up the Golden Gate Bridge and turns it so that it connects directly to Alcatraz.  While this is visually stunning and one of the best examples of CG in the movie, one wonders how a suspension bridge that is 1.7 miles long can extend to an island that is almost 3 bridge lengths away without one end or the other falling into the bay, but facts don't need to get in the way of a good old fashioned cinematic beat-down.  A few more of the comic book X-Men and women make their big screen debut, a few previously seen mutants make all too brief cameos and there are a few surprising deaths and other strange fates that befall the legion of super humans.  Ian McKellen again does a stellar job portraying the conflicted enemy mutant, Magneto, and Patrick Stewart does a fine job as Prodessor Charles Xavier.  The Action is strong and never ending and the effects are fairly crisp and believable.  A final showdown between Wolverine and his love interest [Jean Grey/Phoenix]is almost detail for detail the same as a crucial scene from Buffy the Vampire Slayer season 2, but for the most part the film is a good combination of Marvel lore and original writing.  It probably rates somewhere beneath X-Men 2 though I doubt too many comic book fans will be displeased with it.
B0000C8AVR|2.0|In my time I've asked many many Bob Dylan fans what it is that appeals to them so much. The result is invariable. they say \\"The lyrics man,the WORDS. Dylan is a lyrical genius. He's a genius poet\\" Well if it's the words you love so much why not just visit a lyrcis database on the internet and just print off your favourite song lyrics instead of spending piles of your hard earned cash listening to second rate folk and roots music? I hope you found this money saving tip helpful.
B000002KBA|5.0|This album, when it was released, never got the attention it deserved. It was all about Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath back in the day. But for my money, these guys played heavy blues rock like nobody's business. I can only think the reason \\"Machine Head\\" gets all the play and subsequent sales numbers is due to \\"Smoke On The Water\\". \\"In Rock\\" has the tone, muscianship, writing and those great lead vocals that stand up against damn near anything released in the 69-70 period. So, no big top-40 hit? Who cares. True hard/blues rock freaks listened to a side at a time, not a song at a time. Put this one on....you'll see.
B00005REQR|1.0|I've read the praise- space jazz, counter culture masterpiece, quirky absurdist humour. Sounds interesting on paper but this album is in reality nothing more than a collection of novelty tunes interspersed with pointless sound effects and lame instrumental \\"noodling\\". \\"Neil\\" from the British comedy series The Young Ones released an album of 60s and 70s hippy tunes called \\"Neils Heavy Concept Album\\" which was a spoof. You may have heard the song Hole In My Shoe from that album. Imagine an album containing much worse versions of that and that prety much sums up Flying Teapot by Gong. I'm pretty open minded about music and enjoy most forms, but this remains one of the worst albums I've ever had the misfortune to purchase.     I admit I did laugh out loud a few times at just how pathetic this album could get, but even such lowbrow humour moments aren't enough to make me give this anything other than 1 star.     Spinal Tap was a spoof of heavy metal bands. Sounds like  most hippy bands of the early 70s didn't actualy require anyone to parody them.
B00000K31V|5.0|one of cronenbergs best films. if you like any of his films, this movie is for you.
B00006RCNW|5.0|This show is quite dynamic, I first came upon it by accident after seeing it being advertised on FX and I knew then that I had to watch it.  I found that the story line was quite intense, and it had me glued to my livingroom suite. The actors are superb, especially Michael Chiklis. I watched all the episodes of the first season in one night.  After that I could not wait to see season two which I throughly enjoyed.  This led me then to purchase Seasons Three and Four via Amazon.  I can't wait to get Season Five on DVD.  What also made this series so interesting was the fact that you had to wait until the following year for another series to come out.  My congratualtions on this concept to the writers and producers of this superb show. If you are an individual who appreciates a proper story line, non-stop action and great acting I would recommend that you watch \\"The Shield Series\\".
6304696558|5.0|Goldie Hawn is just perfect as Judy Benjamin, a young woman who is torn to pieces after the death of her husband just six hours after saying their vows.  Yes her husband dies right in the middle of making love to her.  That's enough to make anyone a little nuts.  While in this state of anxiety she calls up a local radio station under the persona of Jessica and laments about her situation.  While the radio receives dozens of callers wanting to give their advice, it's one in particular that gets Judy thinking, and with a little persuasion she up and joins the army under the false impression that she'll have her own condo and, if things prove too hard for her, she can just up and quit whenever she wants.  Little does she know, upon arriving at her base, she'll be bunked with quite a few other women (some of which are hardened criminals) and there will be no quitting for three years. <br /> <br />Worse yet is her Captain, Doreen Lewis (Eileen Brennan) who's determination is to make Judy's stay complete hell.  Upon arriving Judy complains, she whines and fights and complains, tries to escape and, yes...complains, but after a meeting with her family and she understands just what they think of her she decides to take things a little more seriously, and she actually becomes quite good.   <br /> <br />Through the course of the film she becomes a Thornbird and then, through no fault of her own, is transferred to the international theater in France where she rekindles a relationship with a French Obi-gyn (who obviously knows what he's doing if you get my drift) and then her relationship with her Captain who just so happens to be working in the same building as Judy, still determined to make her suffer.  The remainder of the film has Judy making life altering decisions as to whether she wants to leave the army and start a life with her French lover (Armand Assante) or if she's willing to give him up for her career. <br /> <br />The entire cast is outstanding, but especially Hawn who lights up the screen with her charm and beauty.  We all know where Kate gets it.  This is a great movie about self growth and the ability to become more than what people expect of us.  To her family Judy was always a screw-up, never making the right decisions, always needing to be bailed out of something, but throughout her stay in the army Judy became her own woman and proved to herself that she doesn't need anyone but herself.  A wonderfully delightful slice of entertainment.
B000002B5L|5.0|The Fugees \\"The Score\\" is not a Hip-Hop album by any means.  While it will fall into the category of Rap, Hip-Hop, and R&B, this album is pure SOUL.  Listening to some of the tracks will leave you wanting more.  Lauryn Hill in \\"Killing Me Softly\\" no doupt one of the best recordings of all time.  It touched a group of people, from grundge, metal, and pop.  Why the Fugees broke up, well that's another story.  But the CD belongs in any CD collecton.  Even if you don't know who they are they will make you a fan!
0385338686|3.0|As I write this review, I really don't recall the heroine's name, but I guess that shows how much I valued this novel. I am such a fan of the Shopaholic books and I really died laughing at Can You Keep a Secret, that I practically knew to expect a neurotic character, but this was so disappointing. The formula was there, but it didn't pack a punch or have the normal humor of SK's books. It's a readable book, but be prepared to be let down somewhat. <br /> <br />Oh, and there's no way in HADES that I would turn down partnership in order to live as a maid--not after I busted my butt to get there. You earned it, you take it. Period.
B000F1IQNM|5.0|Just loved this movie!  Nanny was so calm yet so funny. I had family over to watch this movie and of course they thought it was going to be a \\"kiddie\\" movie.  They ended up loving it as much as my kids and I.  Highly recommend for entire family.
B000002JPA|5.0|I was 28 when I first heard of this band. A friend of mine was on holiday in England in 1992 and had sent me a letter in which he raved about a band called \\"Dream Theater\\" who he thought I'd like.     Having grown up on Genesis and Rush (with a healthy helping of Kansas and Jethro Tull) during the late 70's and early 80's, Marillion (ably supported in my collection by Simple Minds, Big Country, Waterboys and U2) in the Mid 80's and (at the time) my latest \\"can't get enough of\\" band... King's X, I knew that my friend knew my taste well and immediately started to ring around the local CD shops to see if anyone had the CD \\"Images and Words\\". Fortunately one store had heard of the CD and had a couple of copies.     Later that week I picked it up and from the first notes of \\"Pull Me under\\" I was hooked. This was a great opener, reminded me of a more melodic version of Metallica.     \\"Another Day\\", \\"Surrounded\\" and \\"Wait for Sleep\\" were quieter and beautiful tracks with well thought out changes, hooks, harmony and melody.    \\"Metropolis Part 1\\" (\\"Part 2\\" would come 7 years later in the shape of the stunning \\"Scenes from a memory\\" CD - more of that in another 5 star review!) and \\"Under a Glass Moon\\" were harder rocking and complex technical workouts that showed off the highly skilled  musicianship of the band.     Mike Portnoy joined my list of \\"favorite drummers\\" (with Chester Thompson, Neil Peart, and Phil Collins) while John Petrucci was, up to that point, (and remains so as of today) simply the most enjoyable and exciting guitarist I had ever heard. John Myung (Bass), James Labrie (Vocals - and a lead singer who has a great voice) and Kevin Moore (Keyboards). At this time, and as of today, Dream Theater were and are the most technically brilliant band I had and have heard since Yes of the early 70's and Rush of the late 70's / early 80's.  (The band is still together in this same format today with the exception of Kevin Moore who has been replaced by Jordan Rudess - who plays on the equally brilliant \\"Scenes\\" CD from 1999).     The two tracks that lift this album to classic status for me are the stunning \\"Take the Time\\" - just rocks from start to finish. Played live Dream Theater would incorporate Lynyrd Skynrds \\"Free Bird\\" into the song (check it out on the bands second live CD - \\"Once in a Livetime\\" from 1998), which just fits so well. \\"Take the Time\\" is a track that I always put on any of my compilation CD's or MP3 player \\"favorites\\" playlists.     The closing track, \\"Learning to Live\\" is one of the great \\"classical\\" rock tracks ever made. At 11 minutes it is a masterpiece of changing time signatures, musical styles and really well thought out melodies and harmonies within a hard rock context. For my ears there's elements of Yes, Rush, Kansas, Jethro Tull and Gentle Giant contained within which all combine to present a masterpiece. As I write this review, \\"Classical Rock Masterpiece\\" tracks that instantly come to mind for me (in terms of variety / complexity / originality / highest caliber musicianship) are ...  - Caravan, \\"For Richard\\" (live Version from \\"New Symphonia\\" 1974) (original 1970).  - Emerson Lake and Palmer, \\"Tarkus\\" (title track from \\"Tarkus\\" 1971)  - Yes , \\"Close to the Edge\\" - (title track from \\"Close to the Edge\\" 1972).  - Jethro Tull, \\"Thick as a Brick\\" (Live version from \\"Bursting Out\\" 1978) (Original 1972).  - Genesis, \\"Suppers Ready\\" (Live version from \\"Seconds Out\\" 1977) (Original 1972).  - Gentle Giant \\"Octopus\\" (Live version from \\"Playing the fool\\" 1976) (Original 1972).  - Mike Oldfield, \\"Tubular Bells\\", (Live Version on \\"Exposed\\" 1979) (Original 1973).  - Lynyrd Skynrd \\"Free Bird\\" (Live version from \\"One more from the Road\\" 1976). (Original 1973).  - Rush, \\"Cygnus X-1\\" from \\"Hemispheres\\" (1978).  - Tangerine Dream, \\"Tangram Part 1\\" (Title track from \\"Tangram\\" 1980).  - Frankie goes to Hollywood, \\"Welcome to the pleasuredome\\"   (title track from \\"Welcome to the pleasuredome\\" 1984).  - Marillion, \\"Misplaced Childhood\\" from (1985).  - Queensryche \\"Operation Mindcrime\\" (Live version from 1991). (Original 1988).  - Dream Theater \\"Learning to Live\\" from \\"Images and Words\\" (1992)  - Dream Theater, \\"Scenes from a Memory\\" from (1999).  - Spock Beard, \\"At the end of the day\\" from \\"V\\" (2000).  - Flower Kings \\"The Truth wil set you free\\" from \\"Behold the Future\\" (2002).  - Green Day \\"Jesus of Suburbia\\" from \\"American Idiot (2004).    Further thought would no doubt reveal more that these classic 18 \\"top of mind\\" favorites, \\"Learning to Live\\" though is always there! Music, to me, that pushes the musical boundaries in terms of complexity yet still rocks with an abundance of melody and harmony, a difficult thing to accomplish without 100% dedication to create something new, endless practice and commitment.    There is very little left to say. \\"Images and Words\\" is an album in fine company, one of my favorites of all time. \\"Take the Time\\" and the sublime \\"Learning to Live\\" lifts it to classic status.     If this sounds remotely like your sort of music, then go for it. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did 14 years ago and continue to do so today. It is stunning.
B00005JLD4|4.0|it was a little dry to me but still quite interesting as I knew nothing of the Aborigines except dingos.  I'm sure this is a watered down version of the \\"true\\" story but I found it interesting nonetheless.  I saw this based on recommendations from Sonlighter's (homeschool curriculum we use).
B000EQH2QK|4.0|This album definetely solidified Shakira as an artist.  It has much much more depth than 'Laundry Service,' but sounds repetitive in ways.  The addition of 'Hips Don't Lie' and 'La Tortura,' nearly the same tracks, sort of rendered the album.  Also, 'Your Embrace' and 'Dreams For Plans' are too similar.  But, other tracks like 'Hey You', 'Timor,' and 'Animal City' make the album fun and serious.    1) How Do You Do- Strange, but good.  7/10.  2) Illegal- Mellow and flowing.  9/10.  3) Hips Don't Lie- Catchy yet sophisticated.  10/10.  4) Animal City- Fun, with grunge and depth.  10/10.  5) Don't Bother- Poor 1st single choice, but okay.  7/10.  6) Day And The Time- Very nice, but Spanish is better.  8/10.  7) Dreams For Plans- Mellow and sweet.  8/10.  8) Hey You- Different and extremely catchy.  10/10.  9) Your Embrace- Soothing, yet different.  8/10.  10) Costume Makes...- Grungy and edgy.  10/10.  11) Something- Not very good in English.  6/10.  12) Timor- Deep, passionate, yet fun.  10/10.       103/120- 86%: ***1/2 - ****
0553382179|4.0|Very good book..mine's tattered now.  I bought several copies at one time and gave them out as gifts.  I do think this book is more helpful with the Control Journal she offers. She really helps those of us who aren't BO's (born organizers).
B000ESSTL0|2.0|This release was to be hybrid SACD/CD (plays on both regular and super-audio CD players), and was indeed released as a SACD in the UK, but the US version only contains the \\"regular\\" CD version.  The main draw for me to purchase a re-release of something I already own is enhanced sonic quality of the music or compelling alternative takes (not some silly video I'll only which once), and the US release misses the mark.  I purchased the UK version (from Amazon UK) and I am very happy with it, and it is not much more expensive.  US record companies take advantage of US consumers with habitually sub-standard product, so don't purchase it when there is a viable alternative in the UK version.
B0001HAISG|5.0|I watched it one time (rental) and promptly left my home to purchase it so I could watch it again.  Then watched it 3 more times the next day.  OK, so I have 3 kids and they like to watch movies back to back.  This movie made me believe in fairy tales again.  An absolute dream.

B000A5044C|5.0|This is a film not to be missed.  It is only based on a few true events..and that is all.  Do not go into this movie thinking it is true.  This film has glorified the children and that is good concerning its watchability.  It is heartwrenching and probably could happen in real life.  The film portrayed strength beyond words.  I give it 5 stars.  But remember, it is NOT a true story!  It is only BASED on true facts.  The actual story is too depressing.  Maybe Lifetime could get away with a movie like that.
B000001I0K|4.0|You`ve heard of them,you`ve read about them and you have no idea what the Cramps are or what they sound like.Garage,punk,rockabilly,surf and early rock and roll is what most will say they are but don`t be fooled.....this is great music by a great band.This disc is a good cross section of better known songs,covers and rarities and make this a perfect starting point for first timers.Live is the best way to experience them but this disc is the best place to start.  The core remains Lux on vocals and Poison Ivy on guitar,with a sneer to make even the toughest punks feel threatened.  This is rock and roll stripped down to the basics...a couple of chords,alot of attitude and the big beat - even my sixty something year old uncle digs the Cramps.Fun and reasonably priced...get yours today.
B00003CY6M|4.0|The 2 main characters have a chance meeting at a dept. store looking at a pair of gloves.  They meet again at a coffee shop by accident and really hit it off.  They split the pair of gloves.  That's supposed to end the \\"meeting\\", but what follows a test to see if they are meant for each other (fate).  The tests prove to each other that they are not meant for each other..only we as the viewers know they are because we see how they keep missing each other because of other's interference.  Just to let you know, they are testing fate in a hotel elevator racing up and down floors!<br />There are other tests that come to fruition years later when both are about to be married to other people.<br /><br />This is probably one of my favorite ways to spend my evening.  Not an OUTSTANDING movie, but a sweet romantic comedy, one enough to add it to my collection!
B000EMGAOY|5.0|I have always liked RHCP but, like a previous customer mentioned, they have not been one of my favorite bands.  After giving this release a listen, I just can't get enough of Flea, Anthony, John and Chad!  I purchased the rest of their CDs (By The Way is my 2nd fave), and I am going to their concert this August.  I believe that Stadium Arcadium will rank high in \\"Classic Rock Double Albums\\" and Jupiter & Mars will always stand above and beyond the test of time as long as there is rock and roll on planet Earth.  Do not hesitate - buy Stadium Arcadium now!!

B000FFJ85I|3.0|this album has its good moments, but its definatly not AFI's best work. I've been listening to AFI since The art of drowning came out. That album was a musical masterpiece. This album is just overproduced techno pop punk with mediocre lyrics, which is very dissapointing because davey havok used to be such a good song writer. AFI used to put on some great live shows, i'm going to see them at the warped tour and i gaurantee i wont even get close to the stage because about a million teenyboppers and preps that would probably look at you like you were stupid if you asked them what they they think of the all hallows ep will be jam packed in there. I'm not trashing this album, but as a long time fan i'm just a little dissapointed at the direction this band is going.
B000C65Z1G|4.0|`The Constant Gardener' is based on a John le Carré novel of the same title, and is sometimes referred to as a thriller, but what you see in this beautifully-shot film is not exactly about the secrets of murder or the cover-up of the government. The film's content might look in fact nothing new for those who are interested in Africa and its problems, and the thriller part itself often sounds rather conventional to those who have seen the films of the genre.  <br /> <br />`The Constant Gardener' is most impressive when it shows the love story between the married couple - mild-mannered British diplomat Justin and idealistic activist Tessa both living in Kenya. Right at the beginning of the story, Justin is told that his wife is killed while driving a truck with another man. While following the orthodox course of thriller with the determined protagonist investigating the truths behind her death, the film's first part, fragmented with skillful editing, shows in occasional flashbacks how these two people met in London, and how they see the world differently.  <br /> <br />Rachel Weisz received an Oscar for the part she seamlessly fits in, and you will soon realize that she well-deserves the award. That doesn't mean that Ralph Fiennes is not good. The fact is this is one of his best performances in his recent films. Virtually the film's emotional power stems from superb acting from them and other capable supports including Danny Huston and Bill Nighy. Plus, the film's realistic look of Africa often reaches the territory of documentary, shot in the real shantytown and real people in there, but the film also does not forget that the film is basically a thriller with constant supply of surprises and mysteries. <br /> <br />Not every surprise and mystery work, though. The mystery itself is plausible, but as the gripping story goes on, the film in the second half sometimes relies on the hackneyed methods like computer hacking and a wizard kid. Fast cut and semi-documentary touch barely hides it, but the core of the story is pretty conventional political thriller, something that you might have read somewhere else.  <br /> <br />But the most touching part (and least conventional part too) is the Justin's quest for the truths about the meaning of his wife's life. Only at the very end, and at the very right place, he comes to understand Tessa and her value. He pays the price, and some might think the price is too high, but surely the film has made a point. A truly well-told story.
B000003TAB|3.0|Incesticide is a simple album. There is nothing too complicated about it. Kurt Cobain is a great songwriter but this album does not show off his songwriting brilliance. Rather, it shows off his influence. Each song is a elemental sample of Kurt's styles of songwriting. You get his power pop sound from \\"Son of a Gun\\", old-school punk sound from \\"Turnaround\\", his brooding sound in \\"Big Long Now\\", and his hard rocking sound in \\"Aneurysm\\". This album provides an overview of what kind of music Kurt liked. What makes Nirvana so amazing is how they combined all these styles into their other albums, especially \\"In Utero\\". In his other albums, Kurt took each of these aforementioned styles and created new sounds and styles that could only be attributed to Nirvana. So should you buy Incesticide? Sure. It is not the best Nirvana album but it gives you a good overview of where Kurt was coming from with his songwriting in all of his other albums.
0743537009|3.0|Poor Jack Torrance forced to take a job as a winter caretaker for a luxury mountain resort; he soon finds he has entered a world of evil and seduction.<br /><br />  I have to confess this is one of King's best and Campbell Scott's performance was right on.  His tone was just what this type of book needed to bring the character's to life.  He does a nice job with Jack and little Danny although his Wendy Torrence could have been a tad better.<br /><br />The story is basically of the overlook Hotel and it's infamous<br /><br /> past and the ghosts which haunt it.  I found it to be quite riviting and engrossing even though at times King tends to overwrite.  The build up is beleivible and there are some truly scary moments like Room 217.  Since there are basically only four characters to the story the development of the players is excellent and one can get into the mind of each.  I must say I didn't care much for the cook and found him a bit annoying.  The star of course is the hotel itself and what wonders it holds for the Torrence family.  People who like a good ghost story won't be disappointed much with this one.  However, I simply did not like the ending.  It was way too predictable even though I kept hoping otherwise.  As far as gore goes there was a little though not much and it would have been nice to see a few more deaths then the obvious ones.  I kept hoping the epilog would have some twist but alas it did not.  Danny's Shining or telepathic abilities got in the way at times and what was up with that Tony character.  As far as the little twist in the book before the very ending, come on folks any true horror fan loves that sort of stuff.  As with previous King books the beginning and middle are great and the ending fizzles out.  I would have rather have seen this be a trilogy of sorts like the Amityville series.  The audio book contains 14 CD's Recommended.
B00005JP01|2.0|There isn't much to the plot: racing, women, mafia, cars, faster cars, women...and racing and mafia. If these are your thing, and you want some mindless action and entertainment, you might like this movie. I imagine The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift, might be best enjoyed after drinking a 6 pack of Mountain Dew.<br /><br />In this Story, Sean Boswell goes to Tokyo to live with his military uncle. He soon becomes involved with drift racing. Sean loses a race to someone tied with the Japan style mafia, the Yakuza. It is here that the meat of the story really begins.<br /><br />With so many good popcorn movies out at this time, I don't see this movie picking up much steam. Everything about it is average and forgettable. I would wait until it comes out on DVD, unless you are a hardcore racing fan, or in need of mindless entertainment (I mean that in a good way).<br /><br />Total Score (out of 100) = 33<br /><br />21 (out of 50).

B00005JN4H|3.0|Queen Latifa was great but Jimmy Fallon is an idot.

B000FP2OPY|5.0|I was not going to watch this show as I wasn't too impressed with the previews. But one night I was watching Smallville and saw a preview for the next weeks Supernatural which was the hookman. Seeing as I loved that scary story and I really was impressed with the preview I decided to give it a try and that was all it took. It didn't take long to get into the episode you get pulled in within the first 20 seconds. You are on the edge of your seat until the end of the episode. It doesn't matter if you didn't watch it from the first episode because they give you a flashback of what has happened so far in the series. Basically it tells you their mother mysteriously died and now two brothers are looking for answers 22 years later and trying to find their father.   Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki make a great team together when it comes to kicking butt! The chemistry between them is unbelievable they are both really cute as well. In some episodes it seems as if they really are brothers by pulling pranks or fighting. In the process of finding their dad they are hunting down supernatural things and saving people in the process.   They finally catch up with their dad close to the end of the season and the family bond grows stronger. Their dad tells them that the thing that killed their mother was a demon and they decide to go after it together.   The season ended with a bang and makes you wonder what is going to happen in the second season. I recommended this to my boyfriend who didn't want to watch it at all but he decided to give it a shot and he loved it. He has been catching up on the reruns this summer so that he can be ready for season two when it comes out this September. If you like suspense, thrills, drama, and laughs this is the show for you!
B000FIMG68|4.0|As the second season of Lost begins, the hatch is opened up, and from that moment on, the viewers are thrown into a tailspin of more mystery, eerie goings on, and everything else that made the first season of Lost so good.  While Jack (Matthew Fox), Kate (Evangeline Lilly), and Locke (Terry O'Quinn) investigate what's inside the hatch (and even more msytery arises from who and what they find inside), we are introduced to the \\"tailies\\"; survivors from the tail of the plane that include tough girl Ana-Lucia (Michelle Rodriguez), the spiritual and mysterious Mr. Eko (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje, better known as the ruthless Simon Adebisi from HBO's Oz), and others, as they come across a ship wrecked Michael (Harold Perrineau), Jin (Daniel Dae Kim), and Sawyer (Josh Holloway).  There's so much that happens throughout the second season of Lost that it's mind boggling to keep everything together with the overlapping storylines and more questions being raised than answers, all of which really hurt the first half of the season (not to mention that creator J.J. Abrams left during the season to film Mission: Impossible 3, though he did leave the show in better hands than he did with Alias), but as the second half starts things really pick up.  Characters begin being picked off, and ever so slowly secrets are revealed.  We learn what happened to Walt (Malcolm David Kelley) leaving Michael with some very hard choices to make, get a better insight into just who the \\"others\\" are, and we learn that the island has some connection with the Dharma Corporation.  All this leads up to the explosive season finale when the it's learned what caused the plane to crash, and what will happen as Locke challenges Mr. Eko about pushing the button.  Like the first season, the finale leaves you wanting so much more, only this time it leaves you with your jaw on the floor.  However, while the second season is wonderful television, it is a step down from the groundbreaking first season, and some of the new casting choices (Rodriguez in particular) weren't the best ideas.  Despite that though, there's a lot to admire here, and by the time you get to the closing credits, you'll be salivating for more.new casting choices (Rodriguez in particular) weren't the best ideas.

0895260131|1.0|The problem with this book is that it treats Islam in the same way as Osama bin Ladin and the rest of the extremist/Jihadist type groups do. Instead of looking at all the texts and harmonizing them, it latches on to certain specific verses in order to show that Islam is an inherently violent religion which knows no limits in this regard.  <br /> <br />Just as Osama can fool his followers into believing that they can get closer to God by following his distorted concept of Jihad, Spencer is able to prey on the ignorance of Western readers who most often have had little or no contact with Muslims or their religion beyond what they have read in the headlines. Hence, both Osama and Spencer have similar tactics, yet different agendas. <br /> <br />Contrary to this are the efforts of the ultra apologists who wish to have everyone believe that Islam is a religion of peace in an absolute sense. The truth in this matter does not lie with either side, as anyone who investigates this matter in an unbiased manner will find that Islam has indeed legislated, amongst many other things, Jihad. However, it has also set its limits. Only those who have set agendas will quote from certain verses and leave out others which contradict what they are trying to prove.  <br /> <br />An interesting alternative to The Politically Incorrect Guide to Islam and the Crusades is Haneef Oliver's Sacred Freedom.   <br />
B000BBOUU4|5.0|The colors are wonderful, the story is basically the same as the old movie.  The morals are less stressed, and more emphasis is on the idea of a good decent \\"family\\" presence, missing from many modern-day films now.  I really like Tim Burton's idea for the story, from the looks of the city, the Buckets' house, the factory, and even a few local jokes...like the over zealous Majorette!  Ha ha!  as an ex-band director I found that histerical!  PLUS they were from the South!  Depp, did a better job than many think.  You really have to watch his EXPRESSIONS, this is wherein lies the true nature of this version's character for Willy Wonka!  He's a kid at heart, not the like shrewd business man from 1971, and just as mischevious as the Oompa Loompas!      It's not a musical, but the oompa-loompa's (who can't speak a word of English) can sing English QUITE well.  Many good underlying jokes, you just have to look beyond the story!  Pink sheep... anyone notice there were NO females in the group by that time of the tour?  The original Mike TV mumbled, but this one does not!  And Wonka made a point to yell at him for mumbling when Mike seemed to know.... TOO MUCH.  Mike TV's \\"sin\\" in this version wasn't really TV, nor even violence, but too much LOGIC.  That was his flaw in this film.  Not many people recognize that.  Something about this movie from the realism of the Wonka character... the overall look, the music (which I think is the best attribute to the movie), and using the best techonologoy to replicate Deep Roy as the oompa loompas!  (Lucas should have done this for his clones!)  The ending has a pretty cool twist to it.  After watching the full movie a few times, the pacing seems fine with the few flashbacks which helps the audience fill in the gaps for Wonka's character.      There are many movies being parodied throughout this whole movie, and even bands, and a few books.  This 2 DVD set's major draw-in is the extras and how the movie was made.  Even if you don't watch this version, at least see how it was made. They used more old \\"fashioned effects\\" than you realize.  The over-all style is a nice mix of Suess & Burton.  Overall it's already a classic in my book, and goes more by the book than the original movie... and that's a good move in my opinion.  You're not left with any idea that the kids die (because Gene-Wonka was also hard to trust despite his last-minute mention that \\"all the kids will be back to their old miserable little selves but maybe a little wiser...\\"), like the original gave me. The original movie (which I did like) also gave me nightmares as a kid back then.  This one does not (I'm not a kid anymore either), but it somehow it tends to lessen the morals, which my kids try to emulate the \\"bad kids\\" on occassion rather than Charlie.  Still an already classic movie!
B000F5GNX8|3.0|This movie isn't bad.  It's very violent, it's funny, and it has an interesting story.  But if you are buying it because it is gay themed, think again.  It is not a gay movie.  In fact, there is very little gay content.  The focus here is on violence and humor.
B000002LLC|5.0|I bought this album because I wanted to listen to Hanky Panky, Sooner or Later and most importantly, More. I loved when she performed the latter in the 40's type movie called, Dick Tracy. I had to have it in my collection. This album is also at the peak of Madonna's blonde ambition years. It's not likely, you will see her with curly blonde locks anymore.     It does sound like a 40's album but with an updated 90's production. My favorites-    Cry baby: Just a funny song, about a man who cries everytime he get's his thing feelings hurt.    What can you lose: Nice piano instrumental, which Madonna sings great to.    Madonna actually sings awsome on this album. She has never really sang jazz before this album, and she sings it well.
B000F3AAUW|5.0|There are good albums and there are fantastic albums. This, here, is a fantastic album. Cee-Lo Greene, of Goodie Mob fame, and Danger Mouse, producer of The Grey Album (Jay Z), decided to team up for the oddest creation of Gnarls Barkley, a space-age, out of this world music. In St. Elsewhere, Cee-Lo's raspy gospel voice, with the space-like hip hop/alternative percussions of Danger Mouse, creates a blast into the future of where music should be. With the hit single \\"Crazy\\" and the self-titled song \\"St. Elsewhere\\" and \\"Go-go Gadget Gospel\\", this album is sure to go down in history as the greatest creation.
B00070Q7VO|5.0|Michael Buble's singing voice, plus jazzy tunes equals It's Time, Buble's sophomore album.  This 13-track cd includes upbeat, catchy songs that will have you dancing along.  It also has some cool ballads you could just chill to.  I didn't hear Michael's first album, but I'm assuming it's just as good as this one.  My favourite song is \\"Save The Last Dance For Me\\".  I love the music in that song.  I recommend It's Time by Michael Buble to anyone who likes jazz.
B00003CWPL|2.0|I guess I can honestly say, with confidence, that this is the weirdest, most pointless film, I have ever seen.  If Kubrick liked it, it only makes it more clear why Kubrick himself can go off into some strange unexplained tangent in some of the films he does.<br /><br />I enjoy watching obscure films, but this one showed no sense of direction.  I can't see how anyone would want to watch this one twice, or more.<br /><br />There is such a non sense of direction with this film that they didn't even bother to break it down to separate chapters.  What a depressing film.<br /><br />I was bored out of my mind!  I'd rather watch an Osmond Family TV Comedy Hour than to watch this pointless film again.
B00005JP0A|4.0|I got to see a sneak preview of the movie and enjoyed it immensely! I am a HUGE fan of the book and of Lauren Weisberger, who I saw in 2004 at a book fair and hear her talk about the story behind the novel. I had been waiting for this since I heard Meryl Streep was playing Miranda and she does not disappoint. She was PERFECT! Anne Hathaway is a great Andrea and if you, like me, have read the book -- you see that they did a good job sticking to the book, not great. So if you've been wanting to read this fun novel about a young 20-something with a boss from hell, WAIT! See the movie first, then go back and read the book. You'll throughly enjoy seeing how hellish things really were at Runway.  <br /> <br />Oh, and if you're into fashion, this is a MUST SEE!
B000FILW86|5.0|In 1979 I was 13 and I saw my first live concert: Cheap Trick at the Providence Civic Center.  They were cashing in on the unforeseen success of a hit song recorded on an innocuous tour stop in Japan:  I was hooked.  I remained a fan of all their music from everything up to Dream Police ever since.  Coming from the band that produced arguably one of the best live albums ever -- Cheap Trick Live a Budakon -- and perhaps the epitome of the quintessential live band...this CD...pardon the overkill of the phrase...ROCKS!  Who thought they still had it in them to produce something like this 27 years after they struck gold with \\"I Want You to Want Me\\"?   <br /> <br />Cheap Trick hits the ground running with this latest rendition of their brand of Rock and Roll.  Call it whatever-the-hell-you-want: it hits you with everything they got and then some.  From track one, \\"Welcome to the World\\" to the last track, \\"Decaf\\" I found myself not comparing this to their old stuff, but mesmerized by a CD that by it's own virtue instantly earns a relevant place in 2006.  This CD quickly joined my iPOD library and takes its place next to Budakon.  (It's nice to see Tom Peterson back in the line-up, as his bass was always a strong part of Trick's rhythm that always lacked after he departed).  These guys have not lost a step over the decades, unlike some of the \\"way back when\\" bands that cash in and cash out with their long past \\"glory days.\\"  I don't play into nostalgia to the point of buying a new CD of a long favorite band if the CD sucks.  Test-drive some of the tracks to get a feel for it.  Long time (aging?) Trick fans will hear the band's return to its roots, and new fans will get a full fledged understanding of why Cheap Trick remains such an enduring band.  The only question I have is this:  why on earth are they not yet in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame?   <br /> <br />
0385513755|5.0|This is a book that you may only uncover once in a lifetime. It has great bookb however some say that it is anti-cristian which it just may be. It invoves murder of a very important personand how Robert Langdon attempts to solve it with a cryptographer.

B000FILW86|4.0|As potent as the 1997 \\"Cheap Trick\\" disc and better than \\"Special One,\\" CT deliver the goods on \\"Rockford.\\" This is meat and potatoes Cheap Trick, muscular and melodic with no embellishments (like \\"Special One's\\" \\"Hummer\\"). Linda Perry is a great co-writer foil for the band, contributing the outta-be-a-hit \\"Perfect Stranger,\\" and the band's old ELO/Roy Wood infatuation returns full-bore on \\"One More.\\"<br /><br />From \\"Welcome To the World\\" and onward, this is Rick, Robin, Tom and Bun E. celebrating the joys of being Cheap Trick. Fun and unpretentious, \\"Rockford\\" is almost a Cheap Trick tribute album starring the band as themselves, and their journey through three decades of rock. If you still get all misty eyed recalling the first time you and your friends were hearing \\"Heaven Tonight,\\" then \\"Rockford\\" will be like candy.<br /><br />And I agree with scads of other reviewers here. Rock and Roll Hall of fame, get these guys on the roster! It's high time for Cheap Trick!
B00008PX8P|5.0|This two disc DVD set brings the best of Led Zeppelin to life, close up and personal.

I felt touched watching the stellar performance of John Bonham playing his incredible drum solo in \\"Black Dog\\" it's really a must see, and you DO see it all up close, as if you're sitting on his lap!<br /><br />Watching the band's performances on Disc 1 starting in 1970, you see how much they put into their performances. It has some great vintage footage, and shows the human side of them all.<br /><br />Disc two has amazing performances from 1973 held at Madison Square Garden. Watching Jimmy Page raise his guitar playing Stairway to Heaven, and the expressions on Robert Plant's face while performing are pure pleasure. Their performance of \\"Kashmir\\" is superior, and worth the price of this set alone.<br /><br />I'm thoroughly  enjoying this set, much more than I even thought I would. You see each band member get more and more into the music flowing through them as the years go by, and this DVD set allows incredible memories and the greatest classics in the history of recorded music stand still, and completely rock at the same time.<br /><br />I'm going to be spending a lot of spare time watching this set many times. It's filled with life, soul, outstanding performances, and the greatest music technologically mastered into this DVD set that is crystal clear.<br /><br />One thing is certain: if you love listening to Led Zeppelin, you will LOVE this set. They come alive, and it brings me to life just watching it.<br /><br />I give this set my highest recommendation - they truly deserve it, and you will truly love the intricacies of the performances - they are superior!<br /><br />Barbara Rose, Ph.D. author of If God Was Like Man, Stop Being the String Along and If God Hears Me, I Want an Answer!I Want an Answer!
B00005LK94|4.0|A very nice movie overall. Thirteen year old Amy looses her mother, and has to live with her estranged dad who is well, strange- He spends his time flying ultralight airplanes and making odd sculptures and inventions. She copes by raising geese, who have also lost their mother (due to evil developers). The geese think Amy is her mother and follow her everywhere. The problem is that geese generally migrate south every winter, but there is no one to show Amy's geese the way- until Amy, her dad, and family hatch this brilliant scheme to show them the way south by leading them on an ultralight airplane.<br /><br />The movie works quite well until the actual migration. We get to see Amy's complex reaction to loosing her mother, and how raising the geese helps her adjust to her wacky father and family, and her new life.  But the movie changes tone and becomes rather silly and unrealistic during the flight scenes, pulling tricks of a Disney movie to get cheap thrills: they land on an air force base with no consequences, they suddenly find themselves flying in the middle of Baltimore city due to fog.  There are the one-dimensional villains (the evil developers), and the random, `family moments' which in this case are awkward, ill-placed conversations between father and daughter about loss and the importance of family.<br /><br />With all that said, the migration scenes are still very, very nice (but could have been truly spectacular without the silliness mentioned above) because the real stars are the geese themselves (who are extraordinarily charming and graceful) and the fantastic scenery.<br /><br />It is worth it to watch some of the additional material. But note, you will find that the REAL story is quite different from the story told in the movie.  The actual story is not about a young girl and her father bonding over geese, but a serious scientific venture to save endangered birds such as certain crane species.

B000EGF0B4|5.0|I watched this movie with curiosity and got much more than what I expected.  It's more than a gay cowboy movie.  Anyone who ever fell in love can associate with it.  It's artfully directed and beautifully acted.  The whole movie spent a lot of time laying foundation for the final moment of maximum emotional impact.  The final minute, when Ennis said: \\"Jay, I swear...\\", moved me to tears.  This movie is tastefully done.  Highly recommended.
B000EHSVQ4|5.0|Is the much anticipated \\"The Kingdom of Heaven (Director's Cut)\\" worth the extra bucks? Yes, yes, yes! It certainly is if you are an avid fan of Ridley Scott's work, fascinated with the Crusades or appreciate medieval history. I held off buying the theatrical version knowing the definitive Director's Cut was rumoured. And I'm glad I waited. This 4-DVD package is not only an improvement over the previous release, it offers a wealth of information into the history of the period, the weaponry, the storyboards, script editing, etc. Extensive commentaries running concurrently with the film on two DVDs are provided by Ridley Scott, William Monahan, Orlando Blum and others to shed light into the technical aspects of the film.<br /><br />Although the Director's Cut is now nearly four hours long, it is a much better film in its originally conceived epic form. What seemed piecemeal in the theatrical version, especially at the beginning of the film, is more fully developed. Characters like Balian of Ibelin (Orlando Blum) who seemed shallow are now more three dimensional so that we understand the purpose of his quest.  Sibylla (Eva Green) has a child which we did not see in the earlier version. Her son from a previous marriage is crowned King by Baldwin IV (Edward Norton). A few other characters have been introduced as well, breathing much needed depth into the film. Strong performances from Liam Neeson, Edward Norton, Jeremy Irons, Brendan Gleeson and Ghassan Massoud round out this outstanding film. Incidentally all of these actors, with the exception of Neeson's Baron Godfrey of Ibelin, portray actual persons from the second Crusade, although they are slightly fictionalised to accommodate the story.<br /><br />Armchair warriors won't be disappointed either. The climatic battle for Jerusalem is grand and reminiscent of the assault in [[ASIN:B00005JKZV The Lord of the Rings - The Two Towers]]. In fact, its 'R' rating stems from such brutal and bloody scenes. And graphic it is! Though approximately 2,000 plus Moroccan troops were used as extras, the computer-generated effects are obvious. And never mind the battlefield is not actually Jerusalem's terrain or that Saladin's final assault was at a different section of Jerusalem. It is nevertheless visually stunning...spectacular!<br /><br />While historians and theologians, from both East and West, may quibble over the accuracy of certain facts and practices depicted, this should not overshadow the film's message. Simplistic though it may seem, its strength lies in demonstrating that an everyman like Balian can rise above his own frailties if he so possesses the heart and wisdom to prevail. Moreover, there is an urgency to understand that differences in belief should not preclude shared values, whether one is a Christian, Jew or Muslim. Fanaticism and militancy is futile because in the end each side has to negotiate a settlement equitable for peaceful coexistence. But then, the reality and tragedy is there is still a lack of understanding, even after 900 years since the Crusades. Those differences have never been fully resolved.tely 2,000 plus Moroccan troops were used as extras, the computer-generated effects are obvious.

B000AMJDHY|4.0|Chariodic just calm down and breathe alright buddy it will be okay.  Some people do enjoy catchy punk/pop tunes. And what are you talking about how you can't combine the two? You can combine any two genre's of music! Its quite simple you just include certain qualities of both in your songs.  Your either thinking way to hard about this or you are one of those conforming non comformist who hates anything that hints mainstream. For those of you who just enjoy great music this is a good album, not great, but good. Their style is not original but they add their own flavor to it. In one word \\"refreshing\\"
B00028HBKM|5.0|Absolutely one of the funnest movies ever. The Romans tear Jesus a new one while havin' more fun than a sailor on leave in Bangkok! The beatings are so realistic and the Romans look like they're having so much fun I keep expecting a keg party to start any second. If you're looking for a gory-good time with lots of chuckles along the way, forget about the Texas Chainsaw Massacre and buy this. \\"Hit'im one time for me Centurion. YEE HAWW!\\"
B00005JOSS|5.0|I just loved this movie! It's right up my alley. It has mystery and love and twists and turns that are not expected..... <br />I went to the first showing in my town....sat there and was so engrossed I didn't even notice time was passing, but when it ended I wanted it to go on and on..... <br />Who ever thought of this plot!? Neat!  Regis's talked w/ K. on his morning program yesterday and just couldn't grasp the concept....I would have been a much better host to him.....Regis just didn't get the plot when it was explained to him....even I got it...unreal...... <br />CJ
B000ETQPYM|5.0|My friend had borrowed this book before me and finished in one week and told me I just had to read it... Now I know why! I loved this book not only because it had a great story line, but it also really draws you into the book. The characters all have their own unique personalities. This story is not only heartwarming but I guarantee it will stay with you even after you had read the book! The book really gets you to identify and even bond greatly with the main character as she goes through different stages in her life after the death of her loved husband. You can tell how much these two loved each other and how love has a a way of staying with someone so deeply after death. This book brought out many emotions that we all have felt at one time or another. I highly recommended this book!
B000EMGAOY|5.0|And yes they have done it! <br />Hey everyone knows this album rocks, theres simply no denying it,  songs like Snow and Stadium Arcadium and Desecration Smile and 21st Century and Storm In A Teacup and Wet Sand, blow my head off. <br />Get this album and expeirence the power off the Red Hot Chili Peppers inspiring music yall. <br />Peace Out.
0385720920|3.0|A confused and sex-addicted Victor Mancini chokes at restaurants to make heroes out of the people who save him and later cheats the `heroes' of their money, only to use it to pay for the hospitalization of a mother he secretly wants to die. Though the plot sounds contrived and satirical enough to be a Palahniuk novel, Choke fails to \\"come together\\" properly and instead feels like pages of a good writing style, but not good writing.<br /><br />Victor, Denny, and the others don't fail to be hilarious and unique, but they feel like hilarious and unique outlets for Palahniuk's witty and intelligent personality. That's why all the characters are completely bizarre and have basically the same personality. He just took the one-dimensional characters and he spiced up the book with unimportant subplots and facts (though interesting facts) and made a book out of it. You keep expecting the plot to change radically (like in fight club) to suddenly explain everything and link together the different storylines, but the plot drags on a bit and the ending is terrible.<br /><br />And don't even go near this book if you have anything but an extremely high tolerance for \\"EEEW\\". Instead of his other books, which use `grossness' in an interesting way, Choke overdoes it and 70% of the book is a lurid description of Victor's sex life, choking, various types of excrements from various animals, etc.<br /><br />Final Verdict: 3.5 out of 5. I suggest not reading this Palahniuk book as your first (and if this WAS your first, don't be discouraged and give Palahniuk another chance)
B00005QENZ|3.0|THE BAND: Steven Tyler (vocals, piano, harmonica), Joe Perry (guitars), Brad Whitford (guitars), Tom Hamilton (bass), Joey Kramer (drums & percussion).<br /><br />THE DISC: (1993) 14 tracks clocking in at just over 62 minutes. Included with the disc is a 6-page foldout containing a band picture, song titles, song lyrics, thank you's and assorted finger prints (as well as nipples on the disc itself). Several guest musicians contributing on keyboards or backing vocals include Don Henley, Desmond Child, Lenny Kravitz, Ritchie Supa. Recorded at Little Mountain Studios (Vancouver, Canada) and A & M Studios, Los Angeles, CA. Label - Geffen.<br /><br />COMMENTS: I like this album, though it was somewhat of a disappointment after \\"Pump\\" (1989). The writing was on the wall - the power ballads were coming. \\"Pump\\" and \\"Permanent Vacation\\" each featured a smash ballad that got tons of air-play. \\"Get A Grip\\" features three ballads... \\"Cryin'\\", \\"Crazy\\" and \\"Amazing\\". Good songs, but not what I was expecting. These three songs sound similar and I'd be willing to be that most of the listening public would say they're interchangeable. The song \\"Eat The Rich\\" is borderline rap/hip-hop. \\"Gotta Love It\\" and Joe Perry's \\"Walk On Down\\" are the weakest tracks on the disc. Perry is a God on the guitar, and his lead vocals on his one song makes me think he should stick to the axe and backing vocals. There are several great songs here... \\"Get A Grip\\" with it's slow heavy drum beat, the fast paced \\"Fever\\" and \\"Shut Up & Dance\\", and the 1st hit released from the album \\"Livin' On The Edge\\". The 3 ballads mentioned above would also be big hits from this album. Like anything the band did in the 90's or after; the material has changed with the times, but it just can't compare to their music from the 70's. A good album for Aerosmith, not a classic though (3.5 stars).
B000FFJ85I|4.0|A decade ago,AFI was a typical  hardcore band, but by 1999's Black Sails in the Sunset), they'd mastered and perfected an eerie, metal-edged sound reminiscing of the Cure,a band that evidently influenced this Californians in a big way. Simply put, DECEMBERUNDERGROUND is the most melodically acute distillation of that style yet.Despite the crafted misery-like lyrics that run through most of the album, massively hooky driven tracks like \\"Love Like Winter\\",\\"miss Murder\\" and \\"The missing frame\\" have all enough arena-rock appeal to make them  instant classics.<br /><br />Sure,\\"sing the sorrow\\" was a more consistent and memorable effort ,but somehow with this album, AFI have managed to combine hardcore instincts with dark emotional coated lyrics,synths<br /><br />gothic aesthetics, and electronic beats into a sound that still remains wholly AFI,while Singer Davey Havok continues to impress with his range and ability to quickly turn from a throat-searing scream to a bare-boned croon.Exciting stuff!!.Enough said.
B000E6UK5K|5.0|David Gilmour can still come up with great musical riffs which was something that the dumbkuff Roger Waters[...] couldn't do. On an Island, whilst slower in pace than his last two solo records. My standouts here are the title cut, This Heaven, Where We Start and Take a Breath. To say that Bratananey Sneers would write better lyrics than Polly is like saying Ashlee Simpson is better than Neil Peart at lyrics California Coool a/k/a Slip and Slide. You are a k-nucklehead for degrading this. Buy now or HEEGOTCHA!
B000EHSVQ4|5.0|Ridley Scott's 3 hour and 7 minute epic is a movie for any fan of the swords and sandals genre. With 47 minutes of new footage, none of which is out of place or awkwardly added. This helps make an OK film become a brilliant masterpiece. Characters are now more defined with Eva Green becoming a revelation in this new cut. Also Orlando Bloom's journey from blacksmith to knight is now much more credible and understanding. All this and the usual reliable turns from Liam Neeson, Jeremy Irons and Brendan Gleeson. <br /> <br />Scott's film is in my opinion a better film than Gladiator which was help by a phenomenal performance by Russell Crowe but suffered from story lulls. Bloom is no Crowe yet the story still holds attention, the character interaction is almost as interesting as the battle sequences. The battle and fight sequences of which are all directed with Scott's always assured direction. This great 4 disc collection is a must own including everything you could want to know about the making of the film - including a six hour behind the scenes tour. Warranting a whole weeks worth of viewing. <br /> <br />
B000FFJ85I|5.0|I gotta be honest i was not the biggest AFI fan before, but after this album they kinda changed my mind. I heard \\"miss murder\\" and I was like WOW. and then i bought the album and it was like whoa. Pretty gooood~~ One of the best albums i've heard so far this year.
B000E1155E|5.0|Sorry in advance for this not being a helpfull review. <br /> <br />Dear D.R. <br /> <br />Alright sir you have just lost your mind. The idea that only a brit or a person who has the time to have gone on holiday from their lives to the UK will only like this album is a false statement. Look I will agree that most americans won't like this album but that's because the majority of these bubblegum pop spewing marionettes are too busy flipping through the channels to find the next big reality crazy to numb their minds till they're someone their not which is all the last three faceless generations want to be anyways. The fact is that Arctic Monkey is a damn good band and you don't have to be anything other than appreciative to enjoy it. I listen to music from many countries, singing in languages I don't understand but I like it. In the beginning of time when there was no language man beat on drums and different humans from different tribes all danced like the imperfect beings they are and they marveled in its splendor for music and math are the only universal languages. I hope you have not taken offense at my outrage but being an Arctic Monkeys fan and having never stepped foot in the U.K. I feel you are insulting my and every other global citizen's appreciation for what happens to just be good music. I appreciate you taking the time to read this and good luck on the whole smug thing, cheers. <br /> <br />Respectfully, <br />Victor Moran <br />
B000BM6AVA|4.0|System of a Down is simply an amazing band.  I own every album by them, and this ranks high up on the list (with Steal This Album being first) <br /> <br />Attack- Awesome track with lighting fast riffs which makes it a great song. 9/10 <br /> <br />Dreaming- Strange opening, but leads into a riff that i cant get out of my head. 9/10 <br /> <br />Kill rock and Roll- A great song, but lyrically goes strange at the end. \\"eat all the grass that you want\\"  what the hell?  7/10 <br /> <br />Hypnotize- the second best song on this album.  catchy riff, with vocals by daron being the highlight. 10/10 <br /> <br />Stealing Society- my favorite track, mainly because of the surfer like melody at the end of the track. 11/10 <br /> <br />Tenative:- I really didnt like this track.  not sure why.  its still an okay song, though they could have done without it. 6/10 <br /> <br />U-FIG- great song, however annoying when daron screams at the top of his lungs.  8/10 <br /> <br />Holy Mountains- A dark song, that kind of reminds me of the salem witch trials.  great track, and also reminds me of Spiders. 9/10 <br /> <br />Vicinity of Obsecinity- This was the first track my friend showed me from it, and all i could do was laugh.  Bannana Banna, teracota pie.  funny track, but gets annoying after awhile 8/10 <br /> <br />Shes Like Heroin- funny track, with serjs voice in teh backround.  very likable song.. 7/10 <br /> <br />Lonely Day- Excellent song, the lyrics make you think of the last crappy day you had.  A+ 10/10 <br /> <br />Soldier Side- Everytime i listen to this song, i get a shiver down  my spine.  a very creepy song that makes you think about the war, and religion.  Excellent song to end a great album. <br /> <br />
1878424505|2.0|TOO MUCH HYPE.   This book is elementary and seems like dated information.  The Editorial review by amazon.com basically sums up the entire contents.  Wish I had read that before this book, would have saved me some reading time. <br />  Breaking down the 4 agreements: <br /> 1- Be impeccable with your words....  OK, words are powerful and can hurt or heal.  (this is NOT a new insight). <br /> 2- Don't take anything personally....  Easier said than done, requires some intensive practice and deadening your emotions a  bit. <br /> 3- Don't Make assumptions....  This is a very old rule of thumb. But from another perspective, every life situation requires assessment, evaluation and discernment,  I suppose assumption would be the first impulse requiring the least amount of mental input.  <br /> 4- Always do your best....  Duh, yes mom. <br /> <br />  ALL 4 of these \\"principles\\" are basic information taught by the average parent. Nothing new here.  However, if this book makes you practice them more consciously then it will have served it's purpose.   For me there are much more profound and spiritually stimulating books on the market.   <br />
B000EHSVOG|5.0|The Towering Inferno is still the daddy of all the 70s disaster movies, even if time has taken the edge off some of the special effects and rendered the fashions and décor more frightening than the pyrotechnics. It's also the blueprint for Die Hard, which borrows many of its key setpieces almost verbatim - the trapped party guests, the hero crawling around at the top of a seemingly endless lift shaft, the chopper exploding on the roof, the explosion that unleashes a deluge on the building - while scaling down the all-star cast and adding gunplay to the mix. As a rule in the genre, movie stars survive, TV stars die, but it's not ironclad here, although the probability of death does seem directly correlated to the amount of screen time a character gets.  <br /> <br />It's a lavishly mounted affair and, unlike the Glass Tower itself, beautifully constructed. Stirling Silliphant's script sets up the characters (although some, like Robert Vaughn, end up sidelined completely for most of the film) and the premise so efficiently that you barely notice it's 36 minutes before anyone even notices the fire, while the survival (or otherwise) set pieces are well-staged and show some imagination - particularly the scenic elevator scene. If with recent history it may seem a tad tasteless to say it, the film is Hollywood enough to enjoy as an old-fashioned survival story/disaster movie and at least doesn't dodge the bullet of the main characters' complicity in the corner-cutting that results in the disaster - even Newman's supposedly idealistic architect takes the blame for his inaction in preventing it.  <br /> <br />Fox's 2-disc Region 1 DVD is an impressive package: there's perhaps more quantity than quality, but there's more than enough good extras to make it worth the price of an upgrade if you already have the old version. The AMC backstory is the best behind the scenes feature despite running only 22 minutes. The new featurettes are more sort of sidebars than a comprehensiveacount of the production - interesting and occassionally gossipy fun (Richard Chamberlain's enthused fascination for Irwin's outrageous weave, Irwin taking Stella Stevens out to lunch at Jack in the Box). The NATO presentation by Allen at his most shamelessly hucksterish is hilariously hokey as hell - shame they couldn't find the script for the onstage bits - and the unedited interview footage of Irwin and his incredible hair was fun if only to see his attempts to be a dignified serious figure quickly give way to the carnival sideshow barker side of him! There are also two original 10-minute featurettes covering the fire and water stunts, teaser and full trailer, stills galleries and more. <br /> <br />Sadly, F.X. Sweeney's commentary tends to play at times like an audio description (\\"Here we see the secretaries talking and Robert Wagner having the outside phone line turned off. And here we see the pretty secretary with the glasses walking through the door..\\"). I did dip in and out where I wanted to know more about certain scenes, but on the few occasions he was talking about the making of the film, it had no relevance to what was happening onscreen. However, it's not enough to take the shine off what is still a great fun disc.
0156027321|5.0|I am quite sure I have annoyed just about everyone I know by recommending this book ten-plus times per person.  One can learn countless nifty things from reading this book; such as the nature of three toed sloths, that bananas float in water,  how to tame a 450 pound bengel tiger, and how to juggle three religions (you know, essential life lessons etc).  This book is clever, original, and the greatest book I have read in this lifetime so far (Sorry Hemmingway).  I would skip my wedding day and tea with the Queen to read this book again cover to cover by a comfortable tree.
0385504209|3.0|The whole story is one big chase scene from beginning to the anticlimax.  Despite all the obvious research that was done by the author, the writing and especially the dialogue are very, very cliched and corny as many can attest here.<br /><br />I can certainly understand why this is a book that can provoke such fervent emotions.  I suspect it has to do with the nature of faith itself.  The letting go of all reason and totally subscribing to some beliefs whose roots have evaportated a long time ago.  However, for all those decrying the book as heresy, please examine your own relationship with your faith.  If there truly were a god/jesus/or whatever, does it really matter what anyone else says?  And if religious dogma were absolutely true, why would anyone need FAITH?  Being a former Baptist, I can only imagine most people don't want to know what they invest so much energy in believing may be just plain psychotic ideas from some totally whacked out wacko in the distant past or not so distant past(i.e., the Scientologists.)<br /><br />Back to the novel, there is hardly any character development; the forced romance at the end is almost nausea inducing and the end itself is very very lame.  Like I said, this is your average mindless reading.  Thank goodness I bought it at a huge discount from the MarketPlace.

0385504209|5.0|The controversy surrounding Dan Brown's best-seller is outrageous. If you approach this well-written and gripping piece of literature as a work of fiction (as I did), then all is well and good. I loved it. Dan Brown is a master as interweaving fact and fiction, crafting a multi-layered story within a concept long considered heresy. Approach it as a work of fiction. Rated PG for some violence.
0553565915|5.0|Betty's experience and her book made me think back to when I was a kid. In 1963 my Dad had was just released from the hospital after sufering a major heart attack.<br /><br />  Dad told me what happened to him in Alexian Brothers Hospital in Elizabeth, N.J., something that would now be classified as a NDE. His story is eerily similar to Betty's, but back in 1963 I believe this was a little-heard-of experience and Dad was very private about his experience.<br /><br />  Betty's book is a wonderful guide through her experience and to what I believe awaits us when we leave this mortal shell. Her story depicts a loving God and stresses that love is the key here on earth too. It's too bad that mankind as a whole doesn't realize this.<br /><br />  People have a right to believe that Betty's story is just that...a story and nothing more. I wish some folks would be more respectful and courteous when they write and not use this as an excuse for Christian bashing. Betty's experience was very real to her, as my Dad's was to him in 1963. NDE's DO happen.
B000A88EVE|5.0|I remember reading that Bowie had been typecast as an alien in this film... His character slowly assimilates US culture and he finds himself comfortably trapped, his original mission forgotten. Compare and contrast this film to 1950s spaceship & robot sci fi films. The Man Who Fell to Earth is the ultimate 1970s sci fi film -- Star Wars was about hardware, this film is about how an alien may well experience life on Earth.<br /><br />Yet another disquieting Nicolas Roeg film -- still prickly after all these years and all those viewings. It would make a great centerpiece to a night of 1970s sci fi with \\"Death Race 2000\\" and \\"The Final Programme\\" (aka \\"The Last Days of Man on Earth\\").
B00004VWAF|5.0|_Bitches Brew_ gets the lion's share of notoriety and renown amongst Miles' more hard-hitting fusion albums, even to this day.  Even though _Brew_ is an obvious classic, I've come to the conclusion that I like _On the Corner_ even more.  I think _Brew_ is more renowned because it was the first fusion album.  _On the Corner_ is better because of its wickedly lethal funk, especially the angular and unrelenting \\"Black Satin.\\"  I don't think electric Miles ever sounded better in the studio and this is his best cast of musicians (with John McLaughlin stealing the show with especially daring aplomb on several sections).<br /><br />People say this isn't for everyone, but it could be.  It's true, the first time that one hears this creates a funk experience of a kind never heard before or since; for that reason, it can be almost unnerving.  But once you listen to it more, you increasingly appreciate how absolutely natural this is.  Why not use a repetitive vamp on trumpet, a la a a more dissonant James Brown?  Why not recycle the same bass riff three times (as Miles does on \\"Black Satin,\\" \\"One and One,\\" and \\"Helen Butte\\")?  The repetition makes it funkier than anything you've ever heard.  If you've got the riff why not see how far it takes you?  Miles & Co. do exactly that as well as they ever did.  Which is to say better than anyone else ever.<br /><br />Michael Henderson's bass eats you alive (check out the way he processes his sound on \\"Helen Butte\\"--delicious).  The tablas and electric sitar make everything more exotic (in a meaningful way, not just as dressing).  The bells and whistles that get added augment the already alluring Other-ness of these sessions.  In short, everything fires.  I'd say the only studio album of the '70's that rivals this is _A Tribute to Jack Johnson_, which benefits from a template something along the lines of _On the Corner_ and a similarly stellar cast.  If you listened to what the critics of the '70's said when they panned this, don't listen any more.  Miles is so far ahead of the pack on this one, that I think the world is only truly ready for this kind of brilliance in 2006.  If you're newer to Miles's electric stuff and like what you hear on more famous releases like _Brew_, I can only imagine that _On the Corner_ will blow you into the next dimension.  Simply that powerful and that infectious.<br /><br />Happy Listening!!!isten any more.  Miles is so far ahead of the pack on this one, that I think the world is only truly ready for this kind of brilliance in 2006.  If you're newer to Miles's electric stuff and like what you hear on more famous releases like _Brew_, I can only imagine that _On the Corner_ will blow you into the next dimension.  Simply that powerful and that infectious. <br /> <br />Happy Listening!!!
B0006GAOBI|5.0|You can read plenty of reviews about this movie. I just have one simple piece of advice for you.<br /><br />IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THIS MOVIE DON'T WATCH THE DIRECTORS CUT FIRST!!<br /><br />Watch the theatrical release first. the director cut adds these book passages which will completely change your idea of what is going on. Rent and watch the theatrical version a few times before you see this version.
B00005JNX0|3.0|In \\"Madagascar,\\" four animals - a feisty hippo, a neurotic giraffe, an applause-addicted lion, and a freedom-yearning zebra - break out of their home in the Central Park Zoo, get crated up and shipped off to Kenya, and wind up stranded on the island of Madagascar.  While there, they have to adapt to a whole new kind of life in the wild, learning their place in the natural order of things, which is something they`ve been shielded from all their lives.<br /><br />This is a bright, colorful, amiable film with likable characters, first rate animation and fine vocal work from the likes of Ben Stiller, Chris Rock, David Schwimmer and Jada Pinkett Smith.  The movie is at its best in the scenes set in Manhattan as the animals roam through the city streets causing terror and havoc as they go.  However, once they arrive back in \\"the wild,\\" the narrative begins to run out of steam, primarily because the writers have failed to come up with any compelling villain or foil for them to go up against.  There's fun to be had in watching Alex, the highly pampered and civilized lion, getting in touch with his long-dormant and supressed predatory nature, but it isn't enough to make the film much more than a mild diversion.<br /><br />Still, the movie doesn't completely shy away from some of the more brutal truths of nature, without, at the same time, becoming too frightening or disturbing for impressionable youngsters.  It's certainly a lovely movie to look at, and that makes it at least tolerable for adults - impressionable or otherwise - as well.
B000FFJ85I|5.0|Woh! Hold up kidies pull those dull razors off your wrists go find another alblum! I am a 22 year old male from Cali. This album is the best album i have listened to this year so far bar none. You have to listen to it a few times to appreciate it. I have had it on repeat in the background for the past 2 weeks. This is to me their best CD to date. It has many different layers and is not just some youthful anger filled fit or some 14year old privleged girls anthem. I have loved AFI for years but always hated their fans especialy with the release of Sing the Sorrow. Jade has really out done himself on this CD great tone out of his guitar I wish i could get the same sound. Alot of Jade's and the rest of the bands talent is hidden in the layers ya just have to listen. Some of the tracks even sound kind of like U2 to me its crazyness. Ill tell ya some of the songs to watch for...<br /><br />track 4: summer shudder (my personal favorite)<br /><br />track 8: The missing frame (great great great!)<br /><br />track 10: The killing light (my second favorite)<br /><br />Thanks for the masterpiece boys keep it up!
B000BRBA8S|3.0|***1/2<br /><br />The title of the film, \\"2046,\\" refers both to a time in the future and to a hotel room in the past.  Chow Mo Wan is a writer living in Hong Kong in the mid to late 1960's.  The hotel room he rents is right next door to Room 2046, whose various residents, all beautiful but troubled women, he observes and interacts with and puts into his fiction, a sci-fi story entitled \\"2046,\\" about a futuristic world in which people desperate for love and happiness journey to an unspecified place called 2046 where, we are told, love remains eternal and nothing ever changes.  Chow's literary work also reflects much of what he himself feels about women, love and relationships.  It's not always easy following the time shifts and parallel stories upon which this multi-level narrative is constructed, but \\"2046\\" is a mesmerizing film for anyone willing and open enough to give himself over to the experience.<br /><br />At the start, the film feels episodic and disjointed, as writer/director Kar Wai Wong reveals in gradual stages the complex story he is telling.  We can tell that this is a movie that will require our full and undivided attention if we hope to enter into the minds of the filmmakers and make any real sense at all out of it.  But after some initial confusion, most of the early ambiguity begins to fade away as the major themes and characters come to the fore.  Chow is a man who has clearly lost the love of his life and who has since been trying to come to terms with that fact in his later dealings with women.  He has made a decision - whether conscious or unconscious we are never really sure - to keep women at arm's length, being willing to bed or help them but not allowing himself to enter into any permanent or meaningful relationships with them.  Instead, he uses his writing to express those yearnings for true companionship that he cannot allow himself to act upon in real life.<br /><br />Unlike many Chinese films, which enact their tales against expansive landscapes bathed in glorious sunlight and vibrant colors, \\"2046\\" is set in a claustrophobic world of dingy rooms and darkened hallways, with the camera almost never journeying outdoors or even pulling very far back from the actors in the frame.  The effect of this is to plunge us fully into the world and minds of the characters, particularly that of Chow, whose thoughts and musings become the canvas on which the story is painted.  Tony Leung Chiu Wai gives a subtle, masterful performance as do the various actresses who play the women in his life.  It is his affair with Bai Ling, a beautiful prostitute who wants more out of their relationship than Chow is willing to give, that leaves the greatest mark on our heart.<br /><br />There are times when the movie seems almost too fancy and showy for its own good, when the simplicity of the theme gets buried under the complexity and artiness of the filmmaker's style.  But this is, for the most part, a challenging and stimulating work that moves us even when we don't fully understand it.ious sunlight and vibrant colors, \\"2046\\" is set in a claustrophobic world of dingy rooms and darkened hallways, with the camera almost never journeying outdoors or even pulling very far back from the actors in the frame.

B0001KZM3O|1.0|What a disappointment. This album sounds like a bunch of B-Side cuts that didn't make it on The Wall (thankfully). Waters voice sounds tired and the instrumentals are not even close to previous Floyd efforts. Right from the start this album sounds uninspired and even after \\"giving it a chance\\" as some other reviewer suggested (and suffering by listening to this aweful LP), my opinion didn't change.  <br /> <br />Avoid this album and check out: <br /> <br />1. The Wall - Pink Floyds best and a true masterpiece in every sense  <br />2. Wish You Were Here - Great, very much like DSOTM, only better <br />3. Dark Side of the Moon - Technically a masterpiece, but The Wall and WYWH have more replay value.
B000EJ9MTW|2.0|Copying Led Zepplin wasn't cool when Whitesnake did it.  Wasn't cool when Great White did it.  Wasn't cool when Kingdom Come did it.  Why suddenly is it so cool that they guys are doing it?  They sound more like Jack White of White Stripes with cheesy Dungeons and Dragons lyricizing.
B00005JO20|2.0|Its too bad because this film could have been great. The special effects were awesome but as VanHelsing proved , it takes more than that to make a good film. There was just too many scenes that were over the top and unrealistic, like the Brontosaurus scene with our actors running between their legs but incredibly never getting hurt. Cmon guys. In the end You never really care enough about Kong to get sad because there were too many scenes that were ridiculous. The most important element to the film was the romance between woman and beast, and this could have worked, in fact I was praying it would, but it failed because there were too many implausible scenes earlier on, too many ridiculous scenes involoving humans outrunning dinosaurs and what not. Worth seeing,  but Ive got to give it a thumbs down. More than anything I was disappointed.  The synopsis of the film was: ape meets girl ,ape loses girl, ape tries to get girl back but falls off big building.
0812550706|5.0|I read a lot of books, but science fiction is not to my taste at all.  I started reading Ender's Game for some unknown reason.  It's one of the best books I've ever read. <br /> <br />My 15-year old brother does not read books.  I gave him Ender's Game.  He has not put it down yet. <br /> <br />In the introduction, Orson Scott Card says that he doesn't believe in hiding motives or secret themes beneath the words in a book.  And you can tell in the writing.  Everything is presented as simply as possible.  There are no rambling paragraphs here in which the author uses the alien race to represent some real-world political stance or whatever.  Every word in this book is tied directly to the story, which makes the incredible revelations and touching scenes stick with you all the more. <br /> <br />I'm not a science fiction fan AT ALL.  My eyes glaze over when books get too technical, and the thought of spending months on a ship to get to a new planet, or shooting photon lasers at a slimy alien...it just don't get my juices flowing. <br /> <br />Ender's Game...is different.  The science fiction elements presented here are believable without becoming too complex and boring.  They're used to propel the story along, to make you feel what Ender feels, to imagine yourself as a denizen of Earth at this time.  <br /> <br />The ONLY thing about the book that was kind of \\"meh\\" was Peter's role.  It was great at the beginning, and his influence on Ender and Valentine was well-done.  But what he and Valentine ended up doing/becoming...that was kind of dumb. <br /> <br />Otherwise - incredible book that nobody, NOBODY, should go through life without reading.
B00005JO20|4.0|The King Kong is a classic story. You should check it out. The actors and the plot of the story are good. Definetely one of the best movies of our time. <br />
0743454537|4.0|Let me start by saying that I love how this book is organized.  Each chapter is from a different point of view.  I like that because you see different angles instead of just one main character's view.  Each of the characters are very deep and I enjoyed seeing sides from them all.   <br /> <br />Having said that, now let me talk about my complaints.  I found myself very upset at the parenting skills of Sara and Brian.  I did not like the way they just let their son pretty much do as he pleased, whether it be drugs or alcohol.  They just sort of \\"shooed\\" him under the rug -- whatever he wants to make him happy.  They are so preoccupied with their sick daughter (which is understandable) that everyone else comes in at a distant second.  At the end we're supposed to believe that he just mysteriously got his life on track and became a cop?  Too much of a jump there, I think. <br /> <br />I know Anna was conceived to keep Kate alive, but I hate the way they just expect her to roll over and give up her organs to her sister whenever she needs them.  I was proud of her for standing up for her own body.  I guess I just made these people out to be real people and sometimes I just wanted to slap them. <br /> <br />Also, I won't say what major event happens at the end, but I found it very shocking and disturbing.  I felt slapped in the face after reading 400 or so pages of very intriguing narrative.  It happened too fast and just didn't fit.  I felt it left the reader saying, \\"What?  Where did that come from?\\"  I hate feeling incomplete after finishing a great novel, and this book did just that.   <br /> <br />Overall, the majority of the book is great.  It is written well and the characters are complex and each have their own dilemma in the bigger dilemma, so to speak.  It is a good book, but to me, the ending ruins the whole thing.
B00005N5S5|5.0|This movie is great. It has a lot of action in it. The story and the idea are amazing. This movie is kind of like matrix.  <br />
